            "text": "Background: Rabies is a severe epidemic in Guangxi province, China, with hundreds of deaths occurring each year. In the past six decades, rabies has emerged three times in Guangxi, and the province has reported the largest number of rabies cases in China. The domestic dog is the principal vector for rabies, and 95% of human cases are associated with transmission from dogs. Results: To understand the genetic relationship between street rabies virus (RABV) from Guangxi, genetic diversity analysis was performed using RABV isolates collected between 1999 and 2012. The N gene of 42 RABV isolates, and the P and M genes, as well as fragments of the 3\u2032 terminus (L 1-680 ) and the polymerase activity module of the L gene (L pam ) of 36 RABV isolates were sequenced. In addition, whole genome sequencing was performed for 5 RABV isolates. There was evidence of topological discrepancy in the phylogenetic trees based on different genes of the RABV isolates. Amino acid variation of the deduced N protein exhibited different patterns to those obtained from the P and M proteins reported here, and the previously reported G protein (Tang H. et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 8(10): e3114, 2014), and L 1-680 and L pam . These RABV isolates were divided into three main branches against fixed strains. Conclusion: RABV is prevalent in Guangxi province and strains collected over the last two decades belong mainly to three groups (I, II, III). These RABV isolates reveal genetic diversity. Individual RABV genes from Guangxi exhibit different evolutionary characteristics. The results will have benefits for continuing comprehensive rabies surveillance, prevention and control in China.",

A better understanding of the N gene evolutionary trajectory can assist the development of control measures [3, 4] . Evolutionary analysis based on the lyssavirus surface glycoprotein (ectodomain) revealed that point mutations are the most frequent mutation in lyssavirus evolution; additionally, all lyssavirus lineages have similar evolutionary rates [5] . Phylogenetic analyses of N, P, and G gene sequences among bat lyssaviruses from central Asia have demonstrated that quantitative overlap between the currently established genotypes likely occurs at the amino acid level [6, 7] . Phylogenetic analysis based on the full RABV genome, or based on N, P, M, G, and L genes, resulted in phylogenetic trees with similar topologies, indicating that individual lyssavirus genes are likely sufficient to establish phylogenetic relationships [8] . This suggests that rigorous phylogenetic techniques based on full-length genome sequences provide considerable discriminatory power for genotype classification within the lyssaviruses [9] . The current global understanding of RABV phylogeography is that there are six clades of RABV in non-flying mammals, each with a distinct geographical distribution, likely reflecting major physical barriers to gene flow.",

Investigation of the molecular epidemiology of rabies in southern China has demonstrated that long-distance migration, or trans-provincial movement of dogs (by humans) from high-incidence regions may be one of the causes of the recent human rabies epidemics in southern China [12] . Evolutionary dynamic analysis based on the G gene shows that the RABV currently circulating in China consists of three main groups [13] , and that the RABV in China and Southeast Asia share a common ancestor [14] . Phylogenetic analysis based on the 3\u2032 terminus of the N gene shows that RABV isolates from Guangxi province, south China can be divided into four groups [15] .

Isolates from Guangxi could be divided into three groups, designated I, II, and III (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). Group I included isolates from the Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. Group II contained isolates from the Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces. Group III contained isolates from Guangxi and Yunnan, and from the Southeast Asia countries. Of which, the two main groups (I and II) are related to China I (Clade I) and II (Clade II) [19] [20] [21] , also associated with Asia1 and Asia2 [14] . We compared the N gene of 113 isolates from the world and constructed the phylogenetic tree, indicating that an India isolate and a Sri Lanka isolate are classified as Asia1, the China I and II are classified as Asia2 and Asia3. Compared with the Asia area, the isolates of group I in Guangxi (GX I) belong to the Asia2, including the isolates from Chinese Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces, and including some isolates (94280PHI/dog/1994/ Philippines/EU086202 and 03006PHI/human/2000/ Philippines/EU086203) from the Philippines. The isolates of group II in Guangxi (GX II) belong to the Asia3, including the isolates from Chinese Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan provinces and Shanghai. The RABV isolates of GX I and GX II are principally from the epidemic in Guangxi or from some other provinces of China. The isolates of group III in Guangxi (GX III) belong to Asia4. In the past two decades only three isolates were collected from China, GXN119 was isolated from Guangxi in 2000, and N11 was also from Guangxi, Tc06 from Yunnan; the other isolates were reported in the Southeast Asia countries Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodian and Laos, and were classified as Asia4 [15] , indicating that GXIII (Asia4) is mainly prevalent in the Southeast Asia countries (Fig. 2) , and the group III is associated with SEA3, as designated in a previous study [21] .",

Our research group began surveillance of the RABV-carriage rate of at least 500 clinically healthy dogs from rural areas of Guangxi from 1999, and isolated RABV from RABV-positive cases. Of these isolates, several from rabid and normal dogs taken at different times showed similar pathogenicity in mice, indicating that the RABV from Guangxi has stable virulence [22] . Nevertheless, following an increase in dog vaccination in rural areas, the RABV-carriage rate in dogs appears to be gradually decreasing (data not shown). Between 2013 and 2016, we did not obtain any positive samples even though at least 500 samples from different areas in Guangxi were tested each year. Therefore, the data shown in this study consists of RABV isolates collected up until 2012. After reviewing a molecular epidemiological study conducted in Guangxi [15] , we decided to further examine the genetic properties of these RABV isolates.",

In this study, the phylogenetic trees constructed from the complete N, P, and M genes as well as the L 1-680 and L pam fragments exhibited different topologies with strong bootstrap values as well as G gene (Table 1 ) [22] , although the Guangxi RABV isolates of three groups were closely related (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The possible reason might be a difference of variation rate (varied nucleotides/total nucleotides of each gene) in each gene [35, 36] . The comprehensive datasets of the N, P, M, L 1-680 , and L pam genes, widely distributed across different provinces of China, corroborated the assumption that the Guangxi RABV genes were likely undergoing co-evolution. It is worth mentioning that although phylogenetic trees of the N, P, and M genes and the L 1-680 and L pam fragments consistently had three groups, branching of the three viral groups actually revealed four different patterns. The tree generated from the N, G gene and L pam has a branching pattern in which groups II (Asia 3) and I (Asia2) are linked with group III (Asia4) lying on a separate branch; the trees generated from P gene had groups I and II clustered most closely with group III forming an outlying branch; trees generated from the M and L 1-680 genes and whole genome sequences had groups I and III most closely related, with group II as an outlying branch. This finding indicates that the rate of evolution might vary depending on the RABV gene examined (Table 1) .",

We previously also sequenced the full length G gene for which we performed phylogenetic analysis [22] . The final results revealed that Maximum likelihood (ML) of the N gene sequences generated a tree with a similar overall structure to that obtained with the G gene and L pam sequences [22] , while different to that obtained using P, M gene and L 1-680 . In addition, the deduced amino acid sequences of the N, P, and M proteins and L 1-680 and L pam for all 42 isolates from Guangxi were aligned and compared to other terrestrial strains. Variations in the N protein demonstrated different patterns to those obtained for the P and M proteins, and for the L 1-680 and L pam fragments of the L protein, as well as for the G protein [22] . RNA variation in RABV isolates from Guangxi revealed a significant genetic diversity with differences observed from other geographical regions, and there are strong geographical associations among RABV isolates including the three groups in Guangxi.",
