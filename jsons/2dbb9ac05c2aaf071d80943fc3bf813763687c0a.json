In imbalanced datasets, kNN becomes biased towards the majority instances of the training space. To solve this problem, we propose a method called Proximity weighted Evidential kNN classifier. In this method, each neighbor of a query instance is considered as a piece of evidence from which we calculate the probability of class label given feature values to provide more preference to the minority instances. This is then discounted by the proximity of the neighbor to prioritize the closer instances in the local neighborhood. These evidences are then combined using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. A rigorous experiment over 30 benchmark imbalanced datasets shows that our method performs better compared to 12 popular methods. In pairwise comparison of these 12 methods with our method, in the best case, our method wins in 29 datasets, and in the worst case it wins in least 19 datasets. More importantly, according to Friedman test the proposed method ranks higher than all other methods in terms of AUC at 5% level of significance.",

For PEkNN, we use \u03b2 0 = 0.95 in this experiment. For kENN, the confidence level is set 0.1 and we set p = 1 for GMDKNN. We have conducted 10-fold stratified cross validation to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve [17] is widely used to evaluate imbalanced classification. We use Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for evaluating the classifier performance. (7) For comparison, all the classifiers are ranked on each dataset in terms of AUC, with ranking of 1 is the best. We also perform Friedman tests on the ranks. After rejecting the null hypothesis using Friedman test that all the classifiers are equivalent, a post-hoc test called Nemenyi test [15] is used to determine the performance of which classifier is significantly better than the others. Table 2 represents the comparison of 14 classifiers over 30 imbalanced datasets. The average ranks of these classifiers indicate that kNN is better performing algorithm compared to other traditional classifiers on imbalanced datasets. Though kNN performs better than C4.5, modifications of tree based algorithms for imbalanced datasets perform better than kNN. Moreover, kNN on SMOTE sampled datasets performs slightly better than kNN without sampling. Now, if we compare kNN with its different variants, it can be observed that kENN and WKNN improve the overall performance of traditional kNN although another variant CCWKNN fails to improve the performance in most cases over the experimented datasets. Moreover, it is investigated that, the recent generalized mean based kNN approach GMDKNN performs worse than kNN on imbalanced datasets. In contrast, we can observe from Table 2 that, EKNN performs better than all other classifiers except the proposed sPEkNN and mPEkNN. It indicates that, handling uncertainty can improve the performance of kNN on imbalanced datasets. Finally, average ranks show that mPEkNN is the best performing classifier compared to others in the imbalanced datasets.",

Different datasets of 1500 samples are generated varying the class imbalance ratio ranging from 2 to 10. It is observable from Fig. 2b that, although the imbalance ratio increases, the performance of mPEkNN remains more steady compared to other kNN variants indicating less sensitivity of mPEkNN in these synthetic datasets.",

In PEkNN, for a query instance, we calculate a confidence for each neighbor instance from the posterior probability of that instance which is then discounted by the proximity of that instance from the query instance. We show that this proximity weighted confidence increases the likelihood of classifying a minority class instance. To calculate the confidence we used two methods one using single Gaussian model (sPEkNN) and other using Gaussian mixture model (mPEkNN). Results over 30 datasets provide the evidence that the proposed approach is better than twelve relevant methods in imbalanced datasets. However, one limitation of the proposed method is that we assume all the feature values as numeric. As future research direction, we have plan to extend the work for categorical features.",
