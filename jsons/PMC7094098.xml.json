            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic and mosquito-borne virus that is the major cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. The annual total confirmed human cases has decreased substantially from 12,594 cases to 3429 cases between 2006 and 2012, and then resurged to 5399 in 2016 (Fig. 1\n). The case-fatality ratio and the rate of permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae of patients with encephalitis can be 30% (Arai, Matsunaga, Takasaki, Tanaka-Taya, Taniguchi, Okabe, Kurane, 2008, Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C. (Taiwan), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Libraty, Nisalak, Endy, Suntayakorn, Vaughn, Innis, 2002, Mackenzie, Gubler, Petersen, 2004, Solomon, Winter, 2004, World Health Organization; Lam et al., 2005) and over 35% in children (Kumar et al., 1990). JEV persists in a transmission cycle of pigs, Ardeid birds and mosquitoes. It could infect humans through mosquito bites by Culex tritaeniorhynchus species (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Health Protection, World Health Organization). Humans are dead-end hosts where they cannot develop viremia to infect mosquitoes. Population sizes of farm pigs and the size of rice land, which favors the Culex mosquitoes\u2019 growth, are the two key factors affecting local transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Impoinvil, Baylis, Solomon, 2018, World Health Organization).",

After the infectious period in pigs where JEV in swine serum are infectious to mosquitoes, there is also a convalescent period in which pig sheds JEV virus in their oronasal secretions. Thus, the pig population could be classified into five compartments: susceptible, exposed, infectious, convalescent and recovered which are denoted as Sp, Ep, Ip, Cp and Rp respectively. We considered pig-to-pig transmission and vector-borne transmission. Fig. 5\nshows the model diagram considering pigs, mosquitoes and humans. JEV transmission can be described by the following system of equations (Eq. (1)).(1){Sp\u2032=(1\u2212\u03b7)\u00b7Bp(t)\u00b7Np\u2212\u03bdpSp\u2212(\u03bbvp+\u03b2p\u00b7CpNp)Sp,Ep\u2032=(\u03bbvp+\u03b2p\u00b7CpNp)Sp\u2212(\u03c3p+\u03bdp)Ep,Ip\u2032=\u03b7\u00b7Bp(t)\u00b7Np+\u03c3pEp\u2212(\u03b3p+\u03bdp)Ip,Cp\u2032=\u03b3pIp\u2212(\u03b4p+\u03bdp)Cp,Rp\u2032=\u03b4pCp\u2212\u03bdpRp.\nTable 1\nsummarizes the model parameters in Eq. (1). The effects of Bp(t) and \u03bdp are presented in the dynamics of local live pig population because Np\u2032=[Bp(t)\u2212\u03bdp]Np. In this model, the total pig population is:Np=Sp+Ep+Ip+Cp+Rp,where Np is the observed live pig populations in Hong Kong and is a time-dependent parameter (see purple dashed line in Fig. 4). Bp(t) is the time-dependent birth rate of local live pigs. Humans are dead-end hosts and cannot further transmit the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Impoinvil, Baylis, Solomon, 2018, World Health Organization), thus we model human cases using a variable spill-over ratio (\u03c1) in week i \u03c1i (see Eq.

To quantify the tradeoff between the goodness-of-fit of a model and its complexity (Schwarz, 1978), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for model comparison.

However, in this study, we simplify \u03bbvp as a function of ovitrap index over time, since we are employing a vector-free modelling framework. This is justifiable by assuming that a and \u03d1vp are constant, while IvNp is roughly proportional to the ovitrap index. Briefly, we assume:(3)\u03bbvp=k\u00b7\u03c9(t)+b where \u03c9 is the time series of ovitrap index in Hong Kong, k and b are model parameters under estimation. Constant b represents the contribution of the vertical transmission from adult mosquitoes to their eggs. The vertical transmission ratio of Culex tritaeniorhynchus is varied from 12% to nearly 100% (Rosen, Lien, Shroyer, Baker, Lu, 1989, Takashima, Rosen, 1989). By using Eq. (3), we also incorporate the case that despite the ovitrap index is close to zero during a dry season, the transmission rate can still be positive due to vertical transmission of vectors.",

N\u00e5sell (2005) presented a method of approximating the CCS from simple compartmental models of directly-transmitted diseases. This is relevant to our study concerning pig-to-pig transmission. CCS can be formulated (obtained from Eq. (12.1) in N\u00e5sell, 2005) as:(11)CCS\u22482\u03c0ln2\u00b7R0\u00b7\u03b1p1.5(R0\u22121)1.5,where \u03b1p=\u03b3p+\u03bdp\u03bdp denotes the ratio of average lifespan of pigs (\u03bdp\u22121) to the average duration of infection. The basic reproduction number of pig-to-pig transmission, Rpp in Eq. (9) is relatively small compared to that of vector-borne transmission, Rvp. A modelling study by Khan et al. estimated Rvp to be 1.2 among pigs (Khan et al., 2014). Also, Rvp is believed to be greater than 1.0, as JEV does spread during every rainy season. Applying the parameters under the new strain invasion scenario in Table 2 (explanation I3 in Table 3) to Eq. (9), Rpp is merely 0.0013, which is much smaller than Rvp. By using the next generation matrix approach (Brauer, Castillo-Chavez, Mubayi, Towers, 2016, Gao, Lou, He, Porco, Kuang, Chowell, et al., 2016), the basic reproduction number is:R0=Rpp+Rpp2+4Rvp22.\n",

            "text": "In this study, we argue that the resurgence of JEV after 2011 was likely due to new strain invasion that has a higher transmissibility. some indirect overseas evidence does exist: (i) JEV genotype 1 (G1) strain since 2000: In Southeast Asia, studies reported that Genotype 3 was predominant during the late 20th century, and then genotype 1 started to replace genotype 3 around 2000 and become dominant thereafter (Gao, Liu, Li, Fu, Liang, 2015, Mackenzie, Gubler, Petersen, 2004, Pan, Liu, Wang, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Li, Gao, Wang, Sun, Lu, 2011). One genetic study found that the genotype 1 strain was not observed until 2008 in the regions of Mainland China surrounding Hong Kong (Gao et al., 2013). Thus, it is very likely that there is a newly introduced JEV strain from pigs imported from these Mainland Chinese regions (The Government of Hong Kong, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, 2017b); (ii) JEV genotype 5 (G5) strain: Similar JEV resurgences were observed in South Korea in 1998 and 2010 (Sunwoo et al., 2016). The resurgence in 1998 was likely due to the introduction of G1 strain in the mid-1990\u2019s (Gao, Liu, Wang, Fu, Guo, Liang, 2013, Mackenzie, Gubler, Petersen, 2004). The first isolated local G5 strain was reported in 2010 in South Korea, which coincided with the resurgence of JEV in 2010 (Takhampunya et al., 2011), where the average number of annual JEV cases increased approximately six- to eight-fold (Sunwoo et al., 2016). This is also consistent with our results of explanation I1 and I3 in Table 3.",

In Table 2, we estimated the annual force of infection \u3008\u03bbvp\u3009 to be 0.0042 and the proportion of susceptible pigs S\np0 to be 68% at the beginning of each year (Center for Health Protection, Konno, 1969, Riley, Leung, Ho, Cowling, 2007), the annual average JEV infection attack rate (IARp) among pigs could be computed asIARp=\u3008\u03bbvp\u3009\u00b7Sp0Symptomatic%where Symptomatic% is the JEV symptomatic rate, by which IARp is estimated from 35.26% to 59.50% (with Symptomatic% \u2208 [0.48%, 0.81%]), which is consistent with (Center for Health Protection, Khan, Salje, Hannan, Islam, Bhuyan, Islam, Rahman, Nahar, Hossain, Luby, Gurley, 2014, Riley, Leung, Ho, Cowling, 2007). The results corresponding to I2 are presented in S.1.3, where the annual transmission rate \u3008\u03bbvp\u3009 is set to be 0.0044 and 0.1763 before and after invasion, respectively. The larger annual force of infection after invasion produces unreasonable IARp. With parameter values in S.1.3, \u3008\u03bbvp\u3009=0.1763 and Sp0=57.67% lead to IARp \u2208 [1255%, 2118%], which is larger than 100%. The mechanism I3 implies increase in both \u03bbvp and \u03c1 after invasion (see S.1.2). With Sp0=64%, IARp is increased from [33.98%,57.33%] to [56.10%, 94.67%] after invasion, within acceptable ranges. Therefore, according to the range of IARp, I1 and I3 are likely to be the possible explanations of the resurgence of JEV epidemics in 2011, while I2 is unlikely since it predicts unreasonable values of IARp.",
