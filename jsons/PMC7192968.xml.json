The tube voltage and the current were 120 kV and 30\u2013140 mA, respectively. All data were reconstructed using a standard reconstruction kernel. The reconstruction matrix was 512 \u00d7 512, and the slice thickness of reconstructed sections was between 0.625 mm and 1 mm.

This was done to decrease inter-observer inconsistency. The total CT score for each case was the sum of the score for the 5 lobes, with a maximum possible score of 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Two examples of CT scoring are shown in Fig. 2. The radiologist-defined lesion percentages of the whole lung, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe were recorded as RLPWL, RLPRUL, RLPRML, RLPRLL, RLPLUL, and RLPLLL, respectively.",
