LRT RSV infection probably also increases this risk; however, the number of cases was too small to reach statistical significance. Interestingly, even URT parainfluenzavirus infection was notably associated with airflow decline, suggesting a potential mechanism for the previously reported poor outcomes associated with URT parainfluenza-virus infection [7] . The presence of copathogens has been reported as being a significant risk factor for death in patients with parainfluenza pneumonia [17] . In the present study, none of the patients with LRT viral infection were infected with a copathogen, precluding us from assessing the impact that copathogens might have on airflow decline associated with respiratory-tract virus infection. The absence of copathogens in this study is probably due to the fact that only long-term survivors of respiratory-tract virus infections were included.

The most significant decline of the percentage of predicted FEV 1 was observed between the day of HCT and day 100, during which time the respiratory-tract virus infection occurred. The significant decline observed for LRT infections compared with URT infections has to be considered with caution, because of the limitation inherent in performing multiple testing. Although the percentage of predicted FEV 1 of patients who experienced a significant FEV 1 decline during the first 100 days after HCT improved between day 100 and year 1, none of those patients' levels of FEV 1 returned to their baseline, suggesting that, despite some recovery, LRT infection with community respiratory viruses can result in permanent loss of lung function. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. Prolonged shedding of parainfluenza is known to occur in immunosuppressed patients [18] , and subclinical shedding of respiratory viruses has been documented in HCT recipients [19] . Thus, subclinical persistence of the virus in the respiratory tract after the initial infection might maintain sustained airway inflammation, which may ultimately lead to permanent loss of lung function, even after apparent clinical clearance of the infection. Community respiratory viruses might also activate an inflammatory process in the LRT that, in the patients who survive the acute phase of an LRT virus infection, might lead to irreversible damage to the tissue of the small airways that is independent of viral replication [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1102, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The present study has strengths and limitations.

One limitation is that the predictor of interest (community respiratory-virus infections) was assessed only during the first 100 days after HCT. It is likely that respiratory-tract virus infections can also occur later, after patients have been discharged from the transplantation center and return to a less protected environment. In addition, other potential contributors, such as bacterial coinfection, were not examined. Another possible limitation is that the conventional detection methods used in this study, because of their lack of sensitivity, may have underestimated the true rate of respiratory infections [21] . These assays were also unable to detect uncultivated pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses [22] [23] [24] . However, both undetected pathogens and asymptomatic shedders [25, 26] would be included in the noninfected group and would therefore make the significance of our findings even stronger. A further possible limitation is that the number of cases was not large to provide adequate power to assess the individual role that viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza virus play in the occurrence of significant airflow decline.
