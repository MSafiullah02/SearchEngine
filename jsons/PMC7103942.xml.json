            "text": "The family Papillomaviridae comprises a large family of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with a circular double stranded DNA genome (Bernard et al., 2010) ranging from 6953 bp (Chelonia mydas papillomavirus type 1) to 8607 bp (Canine papillomavirus type 1 (CPV1)) in length (Van Doorslaer, 2013). Typically, the genome contains six canonical genes that are located in 2 regions: genes coding for early proteins (E1, E2, E6 and E7, functional proteins) and genes encoding late proteins (L1 and L2, capsid proteins). The non-coding region is required for control of replication and transcription. All these genes are expressed in a temporal and highly regulated manner (Bernard et al., 2010, Howley and R., 2006). Generally, papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the stratified squamous epithelium of the skin and of the mucosa in various vertebrate species persisting asymptomatically or causing neoplasia (Van Ranst et al., 1992b). The host range of PVs expands across a wide array of vertebrates and PVs have been characterized from humans, domestic and wild mammals and also in birds and reptiles (turtle and snake) (Rector and Van Ranst, 2013). Recently bats have come to the limelight as an important reservoir of mammalian viruses including very pathogenic ones like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses, as well as Filoviridae, such as Marburgvirus, and Henipaviruses. Despite the identification and characterization of several novel viruses infecting bats, only a few PVs have been completely sequenced. Our group sequenced the first bat PV (RaPV1) from an Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus (Rector et al., 2006) and thereafter PVs were isolated from a Rickett's bigfooted bat Myotis ricketti (MrPV1) and a Schreiber's long-fingered bat Miniopterus schreibersii, (MscPV1, MscPV2) (Tse et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2012). The most recent ones (EhPV1, from Eidolon helvum [Eh]; EsPV1, EsPV2, and EsPV3, from Eptesicus serotinus; and RfPV1, from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) were sequenced and analyzed by Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez (Garcia-Perez et al., 2013, Garcia-Perez et al., 2014), whereas Wang and colleagues (2015) identified two novel divergent incomplete PV sequences from New Zealand in lesser short-tailed bats Mystacina tuberculate. Also, Baker and colleagues identified two partial sequences of papillomaviruses isolated from Eidolon helvum from Ghana (Baker et al., 2013). Most of these bat PVs are distantly related to each other and therefore belong to different phylogenetic clades (genera). De Villiers and colleagues (2004) established the criteria for the classification of PVs: different genera share less than 60% nucleotide sequence identity and species within a genus share between 60% and 70% nucleotide (nt) identity of the ORF L1 (Garcia-Perez et al., 2014, Mengual-Chulia et al., 2012).",

Captured bats were retrieved from the net traps and held in paper sacks for 10 to 15 min, allowing enough time for the excretion of fresh fecal boluses. Sterile disposable spatulas were used to retrieve feces from the paper sacks, and placed into tubes containing 1 ml of universal transport medium (UTM).

Briefly, 1 \u03bcl of extracted DNA or water (negative control) was transferred into a 0.5 ml tube with 5 \u03bcl of TempliPhi sample buffer, containing exonuclease-protected random hexamers. The samples were denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, and afterwards placed on ice. A premix was prepared on ice by mixing for each sample 5 \u03bcl of TempliPhi reaction buffer, 0.2 \u03bcl of TempliPhi enzyme mix containing the \u03d529 DNA polymerase and exonuclease-protected random hexamers in 50% glycerol, and 0.2 \u03bcl of extra dNTPs (at a stock concentration of 25 mM of each dNTP). After mixing by vortexing, 5 \u03bcl of this premix was added to the cooled samples. The reactions were incubated overnight (approximately 16 h) at 30 \u00b0C. Afterwards, the reactions were placed on ice, subsequently heated to 65 \u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate the \u03d529 DNA polymerase, and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C awaiting further analysis. To investigate whether PV DNA was amplified, 2 \u03bcl of the RCA products were digested with 10 U of BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, SalI, and XbaI. After digestion, the products were run on a 0.8% agarose gel to check for the presence of a DNA band consistent with full length PV DNA (~ 8 kb), or multiple bands with sizes adding up to this length. Furthermore, primers (Supplementary data S1) were designed and used to amplify the complete genomes with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) using the RCA product, according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. The sequence of the genomes was then obtained by primer walking (list of primers in supplementary data S1) on the expand long-template PCR product. Sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Bootstrap support values were obtained for 10 00 replicates. P-distances were also constructed in MEGA6.06 and were used to calculate percentage identities. All sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KX276953\u2013KX276957.",

Ten out of the twenty-four pools contained papillomavirus reads, ranging from 0.01\u201313.3% of viral reads (Supplementary data S3). NGS alone was insufficient to produce contigs representing a complete PV genome. Therefore, from each pool, individual sample(s) containing the PV were identified on which subsequent experiments were carried out. For pool three (P3) rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and the Expand Long Template PCR system allowed us to amplify two complete PV genomes (EhPV2 and EhPV3). Subsequently, primer walking (and resequencing with designed primers at different regions for validation) was used to get the complete sequence of the genomes. Several attempts to amplify the other three PVs either by RCA and/or Expand Long Template PCR system failed. Therefore, only partial genomes (covered by 50\u2013100 reads) from pools P5 (BATPV61, KX276955) and P25 (BATPV890a, KX276954 and BATPV890b, KX276953) are presented here. Only very few reads in pools 2, 4, 10, 14, and 17 were classified as PVs, indicating low viral load and so no further attempts were made to amplify their full genomes. EhPV1 and EhPV2 have a length of 7958 and 7991 base pair (bp) with a GC content of 51% and 50%, respectively. Like all PVs that have been characterized so far these PVs have all their ORFs on the same coding strand and in the same orientation of their dsDNA genome. They both contain the typical early proteins E6, E7, E1, and E2, the late proteins L2 and L1 and the non-coding regulatory region (NCR) between E6 and L1 of 741 and 860 bp, respectively (Fig. 1\n).",

Additionally, RfPV1 was also described from the mucosa of greater horseshoe bat (R. ferrumequinum) (Garcia-Perez et al., 2014); while partial genomes (about 37% of the L1 gene sequence) of Mystacina tuberculate PV1 (MtubPV1) and PV2 (MtubPV2) were identified in a New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (Wang et al., 2015).

Therefore, different bat PVs occupy diverse phylogenetic positions thereby supporting the existence of several bat PV lineages. This distribution supports the hypothesis of the diversification of PVs in different ancestral lineages, after which lineages could have co-diversified with their amniote hosts (Gottschling et al., 2007, Gottschling et al., 2011). Previously, it was generally accepted that the different ancient PV lineages have co-evolved and co-speciated with their vertebrate hosts, a hypothesis which is said to be supported by the fact that PVs of closely related host species are generally cluster together in the PV phylogenetic tree (Tachezy et al., 2002, Van Ranst et al., 1992a). However, the fact that bat PVs from even the same species are scattered across the phylogenic tree supports the currently held concept that PV evolution is more complex than merely strict PV-host co-evolution.",

            "text": "Generally PVs infect stratified squamous epithelium of the skin and of the mucosa in various vertebrate species (Van Ranst et al., 1992b) and the detection of PVs in stools or their shedding through feces is still unusual. However, given that this has also been observed in humans, coupled with the fact that oncogenic, mucosal and cutaneous PVs have been detected in raw sewage samples (Di Bonito et al., 2015, Fratini et al., 2014, La Rosa et al., 2013), seem to suggest that like enteric viruses, epitheliotropic viruses can find their way into sewage from skin washes, mucus membranes, urine and feces. Those found in feces are likely infecting tissues of the alimentary canal which therefore lead to a sheading in feces. It is possible that the virus may be infecting the endothelial cells of anal region of bats (Varsani et al., 2014) without causing clinical syndromes especially as the bats from which these viruses were isolated appeared healthy. This is not surprising as most bat viruses known today were discovered in apparently healthy bats and therefore it has been suggested that they may have a specific immune system or antiviral activity against virus infections (Shi, 2010). Generally, most PV infections do not elicit host immune responses, primarily because the virus is confined to epithelial cells and the PV proteins that have the highest antigenic properties (L1 and L2) are only expressed in the uppermost layers of an infected mucosa or epithelium; and secondarily because PV infections are mostly non-lytic (Feller et al., 2010).",
