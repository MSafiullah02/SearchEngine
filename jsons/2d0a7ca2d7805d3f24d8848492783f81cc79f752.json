To predict B cell epitopes, we employed several programs. Modification sites such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and disulfide bonds were determined. Secondary and tertiary structures of all sequences were analyzed. Several mutations were found and major mutations were in amino acid residues 102, 202, 207, 292, 379, and 502. The mentioned mutations showed the minor effect on B cell and physicochemical properties of the L1 protein. Six disulfide bonds were determined in L1 protein and also in several N-link glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Five L1 loops were determined, which had great potential to be B cell epitopes with high antigenic properties. All in all, this research as the first report from Iran described the tremendous potential of two L1 loops (BC and FG) to induce immune system which can be used as the descent candidate to design a new vaccine against HPV in the Iranian population. In addition, some differences between the reference sequence and Iranian patients' sequences were determined. It is essential to consider these differences to monitor the effectiveness and efficacy of the vaccine for the Iranian population. Our results provide a vast understanding of L1 protein that can be useful for further studies on HPV infections and new vaccine generations.",

HPV genome expresses six nonstructural viral regulatory proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and the virus capsid contains two encoded proteins, the L1 major and L2 minor capsid proteins (Frazer 2009; Zheng and Baker 2006) . L1 protein is highly conserved among different HPV types and only 10% of the L1 sequence is different among HPV types, and it has the ability to self-assemble in virus-like particles (VLPs) (Kim 2016; Xu et al. 2016) ; it seems that a surface cell protein was involved in VLP binding. Based on VLPs, VLP-based vaccines were introduced that offered highly effective protection against HPV infections (Buck et al. 2013 ). L1 has an indispensable role in HPV entry and the initial interaction is remarkably attributable to L1 interactions with proteoglycans (Buck et al. 2013) . This virus is categorized into low-risk or high-risk.",

In 2014, Fleury et al. found that only a few mutations within the FG loop are sufficient to generate a new serotype escaping vaccination (Fleury et al. 2014) . Shailja Pande in 2008 described that the most frequent variation in amino acid (T353P), threonine, was replaced by nonpolar aliphatic amino acid and may have an effect on the structure or function of the L1 protein (Pande et al. 2008) . It was suggested that it had a significant role in immune recognition and vaccine development strategies and led to conformational changes within epitopes relevant for viral neutralization. In 2003, Yoshiyuki Ishii found that three cysteines (175, 185, and 428) are required for the normal assembly of L1capsids through trimerization and dimerization of L1; also, substitution in the mentioned regions affects the normal function of HPV (Ishii et al. 2003) . The present study showed several mutations in L1 protein; however, we did not find any mutation similar to previous studies in other countries, probably due to different regions or different types of their studies. Lee et al. in 2008 showed the expression rate of HPV L1 capsid protein in the uterine cervical specimens and determined that HPV low-risk group had a higher L1 capsid expression rate than HPV high-risk group; they suggested that L1 capsid expression might be related to favorable disease biology (Lee et al. 2008 ).

In 2009, Bazan et al. expressed, purified recombinant HPV16 L1 in methylotrophic yeast (Pichia pastoris) that could be useful to produce low-cost vaccines (Bazan et al. 2009 ). Wang in 1999 and Zhang in 1998 produced a fused form in Escherichia coli using an inducible expression system and showed the stability of the L1 protein in this host (Zhang et al. 1998 ). Likewise, our results confirmed the stability of the L1 protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts and showed it was a thermostable and hydrophilic protein and two selected software did not predict any signal peptide for the L1 protein.",

In 1998, Martin Sapp et al. described the conserved exclusive disulfide bond of C176 with C427 and confirmed the importance of this bond in the structure of the papillomavirus capsid and DNA packaging (Sapp et al. 1998 ). Conway et al. in 2011 indicated that capsids properly mature and become stabilized over time (10-day to 20-day) (Conway et al. ). In addition, several individual L1 cysteine residues (428, 185, and 175) have an indispensable role in this process. Similar to previous studies, the present results confirmed several cysteine bonds and found some bonds which were omitted as a result of some mutations occurred in such regions in different selected sequences. However, eight cysteine residues (13, 211, 371, 128, 405, 172, 255 and 371) were found in all selected and reference sequences which have the critical role in the structure of the L1 protein. The difference between the positions found in the present study and previous studies may be related to the different geographical regions, the different methods which used, and the different HPV genotypes. It can be suggested that the disulfide bond 13-13,as well as all other disulfide bonds, may play critical roles in constructing L1 pentamer which has interaction with L2 proteins.",

Therefore, they concluded that glycosylated L1 was not important in the construction of papillomavirus virion.

However, the predicted structure by (PS)2-v2 just covered 85% of the L1 sequence and by considering this fact we can conclude that I-TASSER predicted a more useful structure while it covered the complete sequence.

The crystal structures of four L1 pentamers were determined by Bishop et al. in 2007 (Bishop et al. 2007 . They determined that the surface loops contain the known epitopes for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs). Bissett et al. found the role of the DE loop and the late region of the FG loop as neutralizing antibodies epitopes while their findings were critical to describe vaccineinduced cross-neutralizing antibodies which can play a vital role in vaccine-induced cross-protection (Bissett et al. 2012 ).

The coverage of \"I-TASSER\" was 100%; it was 90% for \"Phyre 2\" , and around 85% for \"(PS)2-v2\" recognized three loops (BC, DE, and FG) as the main epitopes and showed the majority of neutralizing epitopes are located on the tip of the capsomere that were related to these variable loops; this data is crucial for designing intertypic HPV vaccines (Roth et al. 2006) . Comparison between the identified loops, hydrophilicity, flexibility, and surface accessibility revealed that BC, DE, and H1 loops were located in regions with the highest surface accessibility scores. In addition, the highest flexibility scores belonged to DE, EF, and FG loops and 4 loops (BC, DE, FG, and H1) had high hydrophilicity scores. Based on three indices (hydrophilicity, flexibility, and surface accessibility), we found BC, DE, FG, and H1 were the highest antigenic ability among other regions of the L1 protein. The combination of B cell epitope prediction and antigenic properties clarified that BC and FG were the most capable regions of L1 with the highest ability to apply in recombinant vaccines against HPV infections (Table 9 ). By considering the list of mutations, the BC loop was completely conserved and just one codon (292) in FG loop showed substitution among selected sequences.",

B cell epitope prediction showed 6 potential regions, 3 of which were completely consistent with 3 loops: BC, EF, and FG that illustrated the importance of these loops in humoral response against HPV L1 protein. In comparison with previous studies, it can be concluded that FG is the most reported loop which has tremendous potential as an epitope for neutralizing antibodies. It seemed that the mentioned mutations did not have a significant effect on B cell epitope regions and their scores; however, substitution in amino acid 202 had a positive impact on EF loop and increased the score of this region as a potential B cell epitope.",

In spite of several substitutions in the studied sequences, they had an insignificant impact on all features of L1 protein; it can be inferred that L1 has a conserved sequence and the existing vaccines are still functional for Iranian patients. However, monitoring mutations is crucial to examine the effectiveness and efficacy of the vaccines. Structural and immune properties of Iranian L1 showed the vital role of 5 loops which lead to a strong immune response against HPV infections. ",
