Adults \u226521 years of age admitted through the Emergency Department to Rochester General Hospital with an admitting diagnosis compatible with acute respiratory tract infection were recruited from November 1 to May 30 during 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010. A subset of subjects with a past medical history of COPD and smoking and symptoms consistent with AECOPD according to the GOLD criteria (increased dyspnea, cough, and/or increased sputum volume or purulence) were identified for the present analysis. Confirmation of COPD was sought as available in the hospital medical records. Patients were screened within 24 hours of admission and those given antibiotics prior to admission, or who had immunosuppression, cavitating lung disease, or witnessed aspiration were excluded.20 In addition, subjects with other conditions known to increase serum procalcitonin levels (burns, trauma, pancreatitis, renal failure, thyroid tumors) were excluded from the study. Subjects or legal guardians provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the University of Rochester and Rochester General Hospital institutional review boards.",

Chest radiographs on admission revealed pneumonia in 56 cases, and 184 illnesses were considered to be AECOPD alone (Figure 1). Bacteriology was considered reliable in 134 (56%) of the 240 illnesses (104 AECOPD and 30 pneumonia). Notably, 47 viral infections alone (37 AECOPD and 10 pneumonia) were excluded from further analyses of microbiology, primarily because sputum samples were collected more than 6 hours after antibiotics had been started. No patient was bacteremic. A variety of viral pathogens were identified and 45% were associated with bacterial infection (Table 1). S. pneumoniae (22 cases) was the most common bacterial organism identified and was associated with viral infection in 13 (59%) and mixed bacterial infection in three (14%). Of the 22 subjects with pneumococcal infection, half had more than one positive test (ie, sputum culture, pneumococcal serology, or urine antigen). Of the 31 subjects considered to have bacterial infection based on sputum culture alone, all had 3\u20134+ growth of a potential pathogen and 87% had a consistent Gram stain.",

Maximum procalcitonin values on day 1 or 2 in patients with bacterial infection (bacterial infection alone + mixed viral bacterial infection) were compared with those without bacterial infection (viral infection alone + no pathogen identified) and were not significantly different (Table 4, analysis A). Because procalcitonin is thought to be attenuated by virally induced interferon, procalcitonin values were compared for those having bacterial infection alone with those having both bacterial and viral infection (Table 4, analysis B). Procalcitonin values were slightly higher in the mixed viral bacterial infection group compared with the bacterial infection alone group, indicating that the presence of concomitant viral infection does not significantly attenuate the procalcitonin response in patients with dual infections. Furthermore, among patients with known viral infection (viral infection alone or mixed viral bacterial infection, Table 4, analysis C), procalcitonin values were significantly higher in the mixed viral bacterial infection group. Given the lack of difference noted in analysis A, this finding might suggest that the presence of a viral infection is necessary for invasive bacterial infection. Using the \u22650.25 ng/mL threshold, the specificity for bacterial infection among patients with a documented viral infection was 96% but sensitivity was low at 31%, with a positive predictive value of 83% and negative predictive value of 69% (Figure 2). Although a significant difference in the mean and median procalcitonin values in this group could be demonstrated, discrimination between viral and bacterial coinfection by procalcitonin was poor (Figure 3). Although only one of 25 patients with virus infection alone would have been misclassified as possible bacterial infection, 11 of 16 patients (69%) with concomitant bacterial infection would have been categorized as low risk of bacterial infection. Interestingly, the single patient with a viral infection alone and elevated procalcitonin levels had influenza complicated by pericardial tamponade, necessitating surgical intervention on the second hospital day. As demonstrated in Figure 3, most subjects in any category (viral alone, viral + bacterial, or bacterial alone) fell below the 0.25 ng/mL threshold on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization.",
