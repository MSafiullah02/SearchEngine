Viral shedding and infection transmission occurs during incubation and the median incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 is five days.[9], [10] Among COVID-19 positive patients who eventually develop symptoms, 99% will exhibit symptoms by day 14.[9] Moreover, between 7-13% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic[4] but may shed virus for weeks. Convalesced COVID-19 patients have exhibited prolonged viral shedding after complete symptom resolution.[11] Unsatisfactory SARS-CoV-2 testing also fails to adequately mitigate this problem. SARS-CoV-2 tests are insufficiently available and insufficiently sensitive. False negative test rates in symptomatic patients have ranged from 3-68%[12], [13], [14] but are more likely to be 16-24% according to the most highly-powered study to date (n=1014).[15] Investigators anticipate false negative test rates are likely to be highest near the beginning and end of the disease spectrum: in asymptomatic, infected patients and convalescing patients.[16], [17] Ultimately, COVID-19 positive patients may even elude a two-week quarantine with negative SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

Cautery creates a plume of smoke often requiring constant airway suctioning to both facilitate visualization of the operative field and eliminate the odor of coagulated tissue. Additionally, post-extubation cough, cuff leak, inadvertent ventilatory circuit disconnection are common occurrences in HNC surgery and presumed to be aerosol-generating events (AGEs). Therefore, we submit that head and neck oncologic surgeries involving the UADT are extraordinarily high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 viral aerosolization and transmission to operating room personnel.[22], [23] Although SARS-CoV-2 circulates in the blood of COVID-19-positive patients,[11] there is inadequate data to assess the risk of viral aerosolization in routine, non-UADT oncologic surgeries such as neck dissections, parotidectomies or thyroidectomies.",

As an example, use of the DaVinci console during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) may be difficult with goggles and potentially impossible with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Use of goggles or a PAPR with loupes or an operative microscope for transoral laser microsurgery or microvascular anastomosis might also be challenging or impossible. Therefore, in circumstances in which enhanced PPE is necessary and use of routine operative equipment is not possible, selection of open surgical techniques for indicated oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancers or regional- over free-tissue transfer may be necessary.

HNC patients are often elderly and/or exhibit multiple comorbidities specifically associated with increased risk for and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[5], [6] Patients may escape screening and undergo surgery with an ongoing asymptomatic or prodromal community-acquired COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 negative patients who undergo surgery will be at increased risk for nosocomial COVID-19 infection via contact, droplet or airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission.[25] Surgical patients with community-acquired or nosocomial COVID-19 infections will be susceptible to magnified adverse outcomes, including perioperative mortality rates of up to 22.5%.[4] In a recent nationwide study of patients in China, patients with a history of cancer were more likely to become infected with COVID-19. COVID-19-positive patients with a history of cancer were more likely to require invasive ventilation with ICU admission or die (39%, n=7/18) compared to non-cancer COVID-19-positive patients (8%, n=124/1572, p=0.0003).[26] These findings are not surprising. For example, subclinical or clinical postoperative aspiration is expected in many postoperative HNC patients but could be catastrophic in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. Lastly, head and neck oncologic surgery patients often require blood transfusions. At this time, acute shortages in blood supply are anticipated necessitating appropriate patient selection along with potential modifications in preparation, planning and surgery.[27]\n",

The CDC specifically states that \u201cfor patients with known or suspected COVID-19\u201d undergoing AGPs, \u201chealth care providers in the room should wear N95 or higher-level respirators.[29] During the SARS 2003 outbreak, the CDC acknowledged that N95 respirators were the \u201cminimum level of respiratory protection required for HCWs\u2026performing AGPs\u201d and that \u201chealthcare facilities in some SARS-affected areas routinely used higher levels of respiratory protection,\u201d such as PAPRs \u201cfor AGPs on patients with SARS-CoV disease.\u201d[32] Therefore, there is urgent need for the publication of case reports or case series from areas with dense COVID-19 outbreaks regarding the level of respiratory protection required in these surgeries. The substantial uncertainty regarding the necessary level of PPE needed to safely execute these surgeries in unscreened, inadequately screened or even screened asymptomatic patients with false-negative tests represents a critical risk to all operating room staff.",

If a health care system has a legitimate target date to deliver safer surgical and postoperative care, systemic therapy may successfully buy enough time to allow the patient to receive the preferred radical surgical approach. Decisions to administer immunosuppressive therapy during a pandemic are complicated, though, since patients with occult SARS-CoV-2 infection would likely experience significant if not fatal complications from the disease.[26], [41] Additionally, numerous trials are evaluating the use of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors without chemotherapy prior to surgery (NCT03952585, NCT 02296684), thereby sparing patients from substantial chemotoxicity. Although systemic therapy without immunosuppression may seem attractive during a pandemic, there is insufficient evidence to guide the use of induction immunotherapy without chemotherapy for primary or recurrent, resectable mucosal SCC patients at this time.",

Conversely, traditional surgery for certain patients may involve the UADT (e.g. minor salivary gland carcinomas) or free tissue transfer (e.g. temporal bone resection for a cutaneous or parotid malignancy). These patients may present high intraoperative and/or postoperative risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Consequently, multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical risks and risks of alternative therapies of all cases alongside shared decision-making with patients will be necessary. Assuming adequate hospital-based resources, surgery will likely maintain a principal role in the management of most low-risk patients with cutaneous, salivary and thyroid malignancies. More prolonged delays in surgery may also be considered in certain scenarios. For example, a several-week surgical delay for a patient with a low-grade salivary carcinoma is unlikely to impact their oncologic outcome. Delay of surgery for several weeks, or even months, with serial imaging may be reasonable for some patients with conventional, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas.[62], [63]\n",

Accordingly, patients with advanced cutaneous SCCs or BCCs could receive radical-intent radiotherapy. If not clearly curative, cemiplimab[64] or vismodegib[65] may be considered. Neoadjuvant use of cemiplimab or vismodegib have not been adequately evaluated,[66] but may facilitate operative delays under extenuating circumstances.

We have provided an example of a possible algorithm based on low-level evidence (Table 2\n). Some studies have questioned the efficacy of N95-respirators against airborne threats and specifically state: respirators may insufficiently protect against aerosolized small viruses[70], [71] and mask fit along with appropriate mask use are imperfect and prone to breaches in seal during routine clinical use.[71], [72] Conversely, other studies have cited the advantages of PAPRs including nonsignificant reduction in viral transmission compared to N95 respirators[70] along with improved comfort, complete head and neck covering, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration.[73], [74], [75] According to another study, use of PAPRs protected 100% of operative personnel (n=124) throughout 41 \u201chigh-risk\u201d procedures (including 15 tracheostomies) in \u201cSARS-related patients\u201d during the 2003 outbreak.[37] Importantly, in this exercise we assume adequate PPE is available to all HCWs operatively and postoperatively.

For a majority of patients with mucosal SCCs , we temporarily favor proceeding with radiation +/- chemotherapy wherever oncologic outcomes are equivalent to surgery + adjuvant therapy. Where surgery is the traditional, exclusive standard of care, head and neck oncologists should evaluate the magnified, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks of surgery and risks of alternative therapies in the context of multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making. Despite the amplified risks, surgery will still be indicated for many patients and appropriate preparation will be critical to ensure the safety of the patient, provider and all other involved HCWs.",
