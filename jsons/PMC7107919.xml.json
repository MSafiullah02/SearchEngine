All patients who underwent BAL were eligible, irrespective of the reason leading to the procedure. For lung transplant recipients, the study was conducted at the 2 sites of our transplantation network, the University Hospitals of Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland) and the University Hospital of Lausanne (Lausanne, Switzerland). BAL was performed according to our guidelines for the following patients: immunocompromised patients who had persistent infiltrates visible on chest radiograph, despite large-spectrum antibiotic treatment; HIV-infected patients who had low CD4+ cell counts and interstitial infiltrates or suspected pulmonary opportunistic infections; patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis whose sputum analysis had negative findings; patients with persistent, diffuse interstitial infiltrates of unknown origin; and exacerbation of symptoms in patients with chronic interstitial diseases or nosocomial pneumonia who had exacerbation of symptoms (including patients who were intubated and treated with wide-spectrum antibiotics without response and who had tumor-like abnormalities). In lung transplant recipients, BAL was also performed as a follow-up or diagnostic procedure, either following transplantation when organ rejection is suspected or after antirejection treatment; thus, lung transplant recipients could have several BALs performed during the follow-up period. Patients were considered to be immunosuppressed when they were receiving treatment with antirejection drugs, were receiving chemotherapy (regardless of neutropenia), were receiving steroids (\u2a7e10 mg per day) for at least 1 week before the BAL procedure, or were HIV infected with a CD4+ cell count <200 cells/mm3.",

HCoV was identified in 29 (5.4%) of 540 BAL fluid specimens, whereas 57 (11%) of 511 BAL fluid specimens that had results negative for HCoV had results positive for other respiratory viruses. Overall, 86 (16%) of 540 specimens had test results positive for any respiratory virus. Among HCoV-positive specimens, HCoV OC43 was the most frequent species isolated (12 [41.4%] of 29 specimens), followed by 229E (7 [24.1%] of 29 specimens), NL63 (6 [20.7%] of 29 specimens), and HKU1 (4 [13.8%] of 29 specimens). The median age of the patients from which the HCoV-positive specimens were obtained was 46.6 years (range, 13\u201377 years), and 20 (69%) of 29 were male. Transplantation was the most frequent underlying condition; 12 patients (49%) were lung transplant recipients, and 2 (16.7%) of those 12 also received a liver transplant. Only 8 (28%) of 29 patients were not considered to be immunosuppressed. Other baseline characteristics and comorbidities are described in table 1.

Nine (31%) of the 29 patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the time of the BAL procedure (of these, 8 were receiving mechanical ventilation).

Of the 540 specimens analyzed, we identified 29 (5.4%) that demonstrated HCoV infection. Interestingly, all 4 species of HCoV were present: the classic OC43 and 229E types comprised 65% of isolates, and the new NL63 and HKU1 types comprised 35%. Infections due to NL63 and HKU1 illustrate the potential role and impact of these newly discovered virus types and highlight the need to continuously adapt diagnostic tools to new species. In most cases of illness, the presence of clinical signs or abnormalities visible on chest radiographs (mainly interstitial infiltrates) that were compatible with a diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infection prompted the performance of BAL. Antibiotics given to patients before performance of BAL had a limited effect, and clinical failure prompted a switch of antibiotic treatment in >40% of patients. In addition, HCoV was the only infectious agent identified in most cases; the results of all other microbiological testing were negative. Similarly, bacteriological test results were also negative in 45% of patients who were not treated with antibiotics before they underwent BAL, which suggests that, in these patients, HCoV infection was the leading cause of symptoms that led to performance of BAL. Serious associated comorbidities and/or immunocompromised conditions that could promote lower respiratory viral complications were also present in all patients. Finally, the study design provided the opportunity to analyze additional BAL samples obtained before and/or after illness due to HCoV infection in 10 (34.5%) of the 29 enrolled patients. All but 1 sample were negative for coronavirus, which demonstrates that the virus was present during the acute phase of respiratory symptoms that led to BAL and was not asymptomatic colonization. These observations strongly suggest that, in a substantial number of our patients, HCoV played a role in and/or promoted the lower respiratory diseases observed.",

One study, performed retrospectively and involving bone marrow transplant recipients, failed to detect HCoV in stored BAL fluid specimens [18]. This difference with our results might be explained by several factors. Our patients were selected only on the basis of the need for BAL\u2014not on the basis of predefined clinical criteria. We did not focus on selected subgroups of patients, 2 winter seasons were covered, and sensitive, real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the 4 HCoVs were performed.

            "text": "Since the first well-defined cases of HCoV infection were documented [6, 7], the incidence of infection due to and the respective roles of HCoV NL63 and HCoV HKU1 among an adult population have not been assessed in a systematic manner. HCoV NL63 and similar viruses [25, 26], as causes of respiratory disease, have been studied mostly in retrospective series or in analyses of stored specimens collected from children [12]. In these large series, the prevalence of HCoV NL63 infection ranged from 2.2% to 9.3% [10, 11, 13, 14, 19\u201321]. One of the largest studies [14] retrospectively tested 840 nasopharyngeal aspirates in a hospital-based pediatric population with acute respiratory disease and found 16 children with HCoV NL63 infection. Most of these children presented with lower respiratory tract symptoms requiring hospitalization. Another study [25] of 1265 specimens from 895 children with symptoms of lower and/or upper respiratory infection identified 79 specimens positive for HCoV (designated New Haven) that is closely related to NL63. Most children presented with infiltrates visible on chest radiographs, and a substantial number of these children were hospitalized in critical condition. Taken together, these data strongly suggest an association between HCoV NL63 and lower respiratory tract diseases in children. Since its first description in an elderly man with pneumonia [7], 2 other adults cases of infection due to HCoV HKU1 have been reported among a rescreened population [8, 22], and 2 cases were diagnosed by screening respiratory samples sent for viral analysis [15, 23]. In another study, by Woo et al. [24], conducted during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 418 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (all of whom had abnormalities visible on chest radiographs) who were subsequently screened for HKU1. Woo and colleagues found 10 cases of HCoV infection, 9 of which occurred in adults. A review of patient medical charts showed that approximately one-half of the patients had chronic lung disease. Hospitalization was required for most patients, and 2 patients died. Our findings are consistent with those of these previous investigations; we demonstrate that HCoV NL63 and HKU1 can also be detected in lower respiratory tract specimens obtained from adults and provide a comparison of their respective roles in causing illness. During the 2 seasons during which our study was conducted, NL63 and HKU1 were less frequently identified than the classic OC43 and 229E species, but they nevertheless contributed significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus-associated diseases among hospitalized adult patients.",
