A growing number of enteric microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa in sewage have been identified as important waterborne pathogens. Most waterborne pathogens are introduced into drinking water supplies and recreational waters by human and animal wastes and poor wastewater infrastructure as well as inadequate treatment. This includes leaking sewers, combined sewer overflows, urban storm water runoff, agricultural land runoff, faulty septic tanks/drain fields and poorly treated wastewater discharges. The vital role of public health in minimizing community wide-spread acquisition of these waterborne pathogens and infectious disease control of the hundreds of pathogens has drawn attention to the need for detecting and identifying bacteria, parasites and viruses directly in water.",

The term \u201cthe great plate count anomaly\u201d was coined by Staley and Konopka [1] over 20 years ago to describe great discrepancy between direct microscopic counting and numbers of bacteria that can be enumerated from environmental samples by plating procedures.

However, microbial pathogens continue to be a major cause of water-related disease outbreaks globally and remain a key public health challenge in providing safe drinking water and recreational water in the 21st century. In addition to these traditional waterborne pathogens, a significant number of emerging and re-emerging pathogens have now been recognized and water transmission has caused significant outbreaks; examples include Escherichia coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium avium complex, enteric viruses such as noroviruses and hepatitis E virus, and the parasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Microsporidia. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, zoonotic pathogens which make up 75% of the emerging pathogens, pose the greatest challenges to ensuring the safety of drinking water and ambient water [2]. The list of potential waterborne pathogens is extensive [2] and Table 1\nprovides examples of emerging waterborne pathogens which are also listed on the latest US EPA's Contaminant Candidate List (CCL-3). Because of the nature of waterborne pathogens, what is perceived as small concentrations are associated with high levels of community risks [3]. The use of quantitative microbial risk assessment allows for an improved understanding of how concentrations, loading and transport influence probability of infection associated with microbial contamination of water.",

Unfortunately, current limitations of microarrays including the lack of sequence information for many pathogens, non-specific binding and inability to offer the low detection levels available by qPCR, make the use of microarrays for the direct detection of very dilute spectrum of pathogens in environmental matrices impractical. Until recently, microarrays have not been used to quantitatively detect pathogens in environmental water samples and a previous PCR enrichment with gene-specific primers was usually needed to increase the detection resolution [4\u2022\u2022]. Multiple displacement amplification, an isothermal DNA amplification reaction using phi29 DNA polymerase and random hexamer primers, offers a promising unbiased approach for increasing the amount of target DNA in the environmental sample before microarray detection [5].",

            "text": "The rapid growth of 16S rRNA gene databases has helped pave the way for developing high-density phylogenetic microarrays to simultaneously analyze many taxa in complex environmental samples. Phylogenetic microarrays such as the PhyloChip have been proven to be useful in determining microbial community structure [6]. The PhyloChip that targets the known diversity within the 16S rRNA gene is able to simultaneously identify any of thousands of taxa present in an environmental sample. The current version (G3) of the PhyloChip allows simultaneous detection of up to 50,000 bacterial, archaeal and microalgal taxa [7]. Besides monitoring bacterial population during environmental bioremediation, PhyloChip technology has been used for monitoring airborne bacteria for bioterrorism surveillance [8], microbial community analysis in biological wastewater treatment systems [9] and microbial source tracking of pathogens in coastal urban watershed [10]. More recently, two methods of PCR-independent microbial community analysis using the microarray PhyloChip: direct rRNA hybridization and double-strand cDNA generation and hybridization have been developed, providing cost-effective and PCR bias-free alternatives to PCR-amplified microbial community analysis [11]. The ViroChip, a pan-virus DNA microarray containing thousands of unique 70-mer oligonucleotide probes to target all viral families known to infect humans has been described by Wang et al. [12, 13]. The authors demonstrated that this approach coupled with a random PCR amplification strategy, was able to detect multiple viruses as well as novel members of known viral families. Recently, several high-density microarray prototypes such as the pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) [14] and the GreeneChip system [15] have been developed for the molecular surveillance and detection of a panel of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and parasites in clinical samples. These methods have yet to be applied to real-world water samples for the detection of waterborne pathogens. To make this practical, these high-density microarrays will need to be further coupled with water sample concentration and purification techniques, perhaps other amplification techniques and then could be used to assess the diversity of pathogens in water and potentially discover the presence of previously unknown pathogens.",

The concept of PCR remains unchanged since its inception. However, the agarose gel-based detection of PCR amplification products has undergone dramatically changes that have led to a revolutionary testing platform, namely quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which enables quantification of DNA targets by monitoring amplified products during cycling as indicated by increased fluorescence [16\u2022\u2022]. In the past few years, the development of qPCR has provided significant improvements in PCR-based assays for the detection of waterborne bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens (Table 1). Currently, qPCR offers numerous advantages over conventional, end-point PCR techniques such as higher sensitivity and specificity, faster rate of detection, no post-PCR analysis and thereby minimizing the risk of carryover contamination, and the capability to provide quantitative results. The dual-labeled fluorescent probe such as TaqMan probe has been the most popular technique of choice for detecting pathogens in environmental samples owing to its higher specificity. The advantage of this assay is that the target amplicon is verified by the probe which recognizes internal amplicon sequences. Inclusion of an internal control in each sample is essential for the accuracy of quantitative results, particularly for complex environmental matrices, by monitoring the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription (for RNA target) as well as the presence of PCR inhibitors.",

Detection of pathogenic viruses by qRT-PCR does not necessarily indicate their infectivity, but it has been an excellent methodology for studying virus pollution in the water environment. Moreover, the use of qRT-PCR for the analysis of non-cultivable noroviruses [17] and slow growing hepatitis A virus [18] has been fundamental to advancing the understanding of the occurrence of these human pathogens in water environments. Surveys around the world have begun exploring the occurrence of both DNA and RNA viruses in water by qPCR (see [19\u2022] for a review). However, there were no consistent trends found in regard to the viral types or levels. The molecular characterization of environmental viral strains has revealed a great genetic diversity of human pathogenic viruses in polluted surface waters [20]. Yet no global survey of viruses has been undertaken by evaluating the same virus targets, using the same protocols. A temporal assessment is needed to compare the diversity and level of viral infections and water pollution to contrast developing to developed regions of the world, from tropical environments to temperate conditions and to contrast rural versus urban populations. It may be possible to take on global virus characterization in the future with evolution in technology that allows higher throughput and hundreds of targets.",

Based on the sequencing-by-synthesis principle, pyrosequencing is a DNA sequencing technology that utilizes enzyme-coupled reactions and bioluminescence to monitor the pyrophosphate release accompanying nucleotide incorporation, in real-time (Figure 1\n) [23\u2022\u2022]. A major advance for pyrosequencing technology came with the introduction of the Roche 454 sequencing platform. This next generation sequencing technology holds several advantages over the more traditional Sanger sequencing include higher throughput, simplified sample preparation and the miniaturization of sequencing chemistries, enabling massively parallel sequencing reactions to be carried out at a scale and cost not previously possible [24\u2022]. The latest 454 sequencing platform, GX FLX+ is able to produce one million reads (with a read length of up to 1000 bases) per 23-hour sequencing run.",

Unlike PCR and microarray methods where investigators are limited by known sequence information and must select the range of pathogens to be considered in a given assay, high-throughput sequencing approach is unbiased and makes it possible to detect novel pathogens. Figure 1 shows the basic steps that are needed for the detection of microbial pathogens in environmental waters by pyrosequencing. Besides the direct detection of pathogens in stool specimens [25], several recent papers describe the application of pyrosequencing to investigate the diversity of bacterial and viral pathogens in environmental samples (Table 2\n). A general finding from these studies is that the majority of the sequences in environmental metagenomes, particularly viral sequences, have no similarities to known genes in the database, indicating high abundance of uncharacterized viruses which may be potential human pathogens [26\u2022, 27\u2022].",

As the majority of waterborne disease outbreaks had undetermined etiology agents [30], pyrosequencing and other high-throughput sequencing technologies are likely to identify novel pathogens associated with waterborne illnesses in the future and could address multiple etiologies. Moreover, sequencing of outbreak isolates is of public health interest, particularly if rapid data about virulence markers can be obtained. Most recently, a new whole genome amplification and sequencing approach called \u2018Single Virus Genomics\u2019, which enables the isolation and complete genome sequencing by 454 pyrosequencing of the single virus particle (bacteriophages lambda and T4), has been described [31\u2022\u2022]. This proof-of-concept study is likely to enhance uncultivated virus discovery as well as provide relevant viral reference genomes for the assembly of metagenomic data and the design of qPCR primers and probes targeting uncultivated viruses. Further study is needed to optimize this approach for human pathogenic viruses in environmental waters.",

Rapid detection and identification of waterborne pathogens by novel molecular tools are often hampered by the relatively low abundance of target organisms in water samples. Much work has been carried out in the development of rapid, sensitive and specific analytical methods. However, less emphasis has been placed on the pre-analytical or upstream sample processing which must be able to selectively separate and concentrate all target pathogens in each water sample. The preconcentration step is important in improving the detection sensitivity of microbial contaminants, particularly by molecular detection tools which use extremely small sample volumes (a few microliters). Recently, tangential-flow, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, which uses size-exclusion as the mechanism of concentration, has been shown to be a promising technique to concentrate diverse pathogens in a single process [32, 33]. Moreover, ultrafiltration is currently the method of choice to concentrate viruses from large volumes of water for metagenomic detection by pyrosequencing [26\u2022, 27\u2022].",
