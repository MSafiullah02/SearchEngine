This step likely proceeds via a short\u2010lived magnesium hydride, which rapidly deprotonates the pendant silyl amine to regenerate 1. This mechanism is somewhat different to previous alkaline earth catalysts, which were added as pre\u2010catalysts and underwent an initial irreversible deprotonation reaction, typically with elimination of an alkyl or amino species.24 Here, because of the bidentate nature of L1, the amine generated is held proximal to the magnesium and continues to take part in the reaction.

The fact that compound 5 is fully consumed at the end of the reaction, while some 4 remains unreacted, can be explained by both species being steady\u2010state intermediates of the catalytic cycle (i.e. their rate of formation and consumption is approximately equal). This means the concentration of both 4 and 5 remains low and relatively constant throughout. As the reaction nears completion, 5 is fully converted to 3 through reaction with the catalyst. However, compound 4 can only be consumed in the presence of both Me2NH\u22c5BH3 and 1 (see Scheme 2). As the reaction nears completion, all the Me2NH\u22c5BH3 will be converted to 4 by reacting with the catalyst. This means that there is no Me2NH\u22c5BH3 left for 4 to react with, and thus a small amount of 4 is left unreacted once all substrate is consumed. It should be noted that the off\u2010metal dimerization of 4 to 3 has been observed previously, and may occur in our system given sufficient time.56, 57, 58 However, we did not observe this, and it is likely that this second\u2010order process is slow in the catalytic regime.47 Finally, for the reaction of iPr2NH\u22c5BH3 with 1, it is probable that the insertion reaction is prevented by the increased steric bulk, leading to iPr2N=BH2 as the major product.
