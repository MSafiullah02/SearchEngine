            "text": "Lower respiratory tract-infections (LRTIs) are a major cause of hospitalizations during childhood [1]. Determining pathogen specific causality of LRTIs is hampered by lack of sensitive methods for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, as well as the concurrent identification of multiple respiratory-viral pathogens, particularly when using molecular assays [2]. Nevertheless, worldwide studies attribute a large proportion of LRTIs to viral infections [3], [4]. Large-scale molecular screening based technologies have contributed to the discovery of new infectious pathogens, including in 2007 two polyomaviruses (PyV), WU- and KI-polyomavirus [5], [6]. These PyV belong to the Polyomaviridae family and have been associated with respiratory disease in humans, although direct evidence of causality is lacking [7]. Two other polyomaviruses (BKPyV and JCPyV) have been implicated in disease in immunocompromised patients [8], [9], [10]. There are, however, conflicting data with regard to the role of WUPyV and KIPyV in immunocompromised individuals [11], [12], [13].",

The rational of this approach is that any biological-plausible difference between PCV- and placebo-recipients in the incidence of any disease which could be associated with vaccine-serotype pneumococcal infection would indicate a role of vaccine-serotypes in the outcome of interest (for review [16]). For example, we have previously reported that PCV-recipients, had a 45% lower incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations in which influenza-virus was identified, and as such concluded that at least a similar proportion of the influenza-associated pneumonias among placebo-recipients was precipitated by co-infection with PCV-serotypes [14].",

Another study from South Africa reported that 57% of 21 children with LRTIs with WUPyV and 33% of 3 with KIPyV were HIV-infected, however, the HIV-status was unknown in 50% of the cases [12]. In that same study, both polyomaviruses were absent among 50 healthy immunocompetent controls [12]. The role of WU/KIPyV as more serious pathogens in immunocompromised individuals is uncertain. Higher viral loads of PyV were documented in lymphoid tissues and in the brains of HIV-infected adults compared to those from immunocompetent individuals [23], [24]. Similarly higher KIPyV viral loads were found in respiratory-tract specimens from haematology/oncology paediatric patients with respiratory infections, however, whether the viral loads correlated with disease severity was not established [13]. These observations suggest that there may be more viral replication and/or that polyomaviruses might reactivate in immunosuppressed individuals, implying that T-cell impairment might be a factor in facilitating polyomavirus replication. Norja et al. found that WU/KIPyV detection on respiratory samples occurred predominantly in two groups of subjects: immunocompetent <2 years of age with LRTIs (7%) in whom there was a high frequency of co-infection (75%), and among older, generally immunocompromised individuals without respiratory illness (11%) or with mild upper respiratory-tract infections (7%) [7].",

Similar observations have been detected between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children for other viruses [18], and consequently may not necessarily infer causality for polyomaviruses precipitate more severe illness in HIV-infected children. The increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children could have been related to other co-morbidities such as bacterial or other non-viral co-infections. In the absence of sensitive tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, as well as lack of investigating for other non-viral causes of pneumonia, our study is unable to conclude the actual role of polyomaviruses to more severe disease in HIV-infected children. Nonetheless, the higher CFR, as well as that four fatal cases with polyomavirus as the sole respiratory-virus detected were all HIV-infected children suggest a possible association of polyomavirus causing severe disease in HIV-infected. Furthermore, five HIV-infected children had recurrent KIPyV-positive LRTIs compared to only one HIV-uninfected child. This could have been due to extended viral shedding, viral reactivation or reinfection. A study from Germany detected KIPyV DNA in the respiratory-tract of an immunocompromised child for 7 months and hypothesized that a KIPyV infection during childhood could result in latency of the virus in normal individuals, however, an immune impairment could result in viral reactivation [25]. In 2001 the detection rate of KIPyV in HIV-infected children was higher than in 2000 this may be because of the older cohort in 2001, hence possibly different risk of infection, or differences in year-to-year epidemics.",

Using this type of analysis, our study suggests that co-infections with PCV9-serotypes contribute to hospitalizations for clinical pneumonia in which WU/KIPyV were identified. The imputed rate of co-infection of pneumococci in children with polyomaviruses-positive pneumonia from our study provides a conservative estimate of this possible interaction as only 9 serotypes were included in the vaccine and VE even against vaccine-serotypes pneumococcal pneumonia was not 100%. The high VE estimate for KIPyV-positive disease needs to be contextualized within the wide uncertainty bounds of this estimate. The suggested interaction between polyomaviruses and pneumococcus warrants further study.",

Another limitation of our study is that we relied on NPAs, where identification of an organism does not necessarily imply infection. Also in our study the HIV-infected children were not treated with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), which may have contributed to their clinical course and may differ to HIV-infected children treated with ART.",
