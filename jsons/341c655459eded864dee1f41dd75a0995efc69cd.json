This paper builds on an observation that information needs are also expressed in the form of questions in online Community Question Answering (CQA) communities. We take a step towards understanding the process of formulating queries from questions to form a basis for automatic derivation of search logs from CQA forums. Specifically, we sample natural language (NL) questions spanning diverse themes from the StackExchange platform, and conduct a largescale conversion experiment where crowdworkers submit search queries they would use when looking for equivalent information. We also release a dataset of 7,000 question-query pairs from our study.",

There are roughly ten sessions per user, where each session is usually a set of reformulations. Such collections with just a couple of queries per user are inadequate for driving research in privacy, especially research that focuses on topical profiling. The 2014 Yandex collection [15] is useful for evaluating personalization algorithms. However, to protect the privacy of Yandex users, every query term is replaced by a numeric ID. This anonymization strategy makes semantic interpretation impossible and may be a reason why this collection has not received widespread adoption in privacy studies. Interpretability of log contents is vital for understanding privacy threats [5, 6, 8] .",

[5] synthesized a query log from the StackExchange platform 2 -a collection of CQA subforums on a multitude of topics. Queries in the synthetic log were derived from users' information needs posed as natural language questions. A collection like this has three advantages. First, it enables creation of rich user profiles by stitching queries derived from questions asked by the same user across different topical forums. Second, since it is derived from explicitly public resources created by users under the StackExchange terms of service (allowing reuse of data for research purposes), it escapes the ethical pitfalls intrinsic to dissemination of private user data. Third, CQA forums contain questions and assessments of relevance in the form of accepted answers from the same user, which is vital for the correct interpretation of query intent [2, 9] . Other signals like similar queries and reformulations can also be simulated with related questions and duplicates, available on most CQA forums.",

Since this is significant effort expected to require more than an hour's work at a stretch, we paid $9 per HIT ($6 in our pilot, owing to fewer questions). The workers (Turkers) were given three hours to complete a HIT, while the actual average time taken turned out to be 1.6 h. This is about two minutes per question, which we deem as a reasonable time required for understanding the intent of a typical CQA question that often has a few hundred words.",

To build queries, we allowed workers to: (i) select exact words from the text of the question, (ii) modify question words ('use' \u2192 'using' ), or, (iii) use their own words to clarify the information need. These cases were not made explicit, but communicated by coloring words in the text and the query. Questions were presented as follows (some choices aimed at avoiding title bias, see Sect. 3.2):",

In nine of such cases, the subforum name was not present in the title or body of the question, which suggests that the presence of the subforum name is important in disambiguating the context. Most query words were chosen from the title, although title words are often repeated in the body of the question. Workers used their own words or words modified from the question 47 times.

This is a typical top-heavy distribution, suggesting humans conceptualize the core content of the information need first and gradually add specifications or conditions of intent [13, 14] towards the end. Notably, even the last 10% of the question contains 2.78% of the query, suggesting that we cannot disregard tail ends of questions. Finally, note that the title is positioned at the beginning of the question (Sect. 3.2), and alone accounts for 57% of the query. Title words, however, do repeat in the body. Further inspection reveals that only 12% of the query mass is comprised of words that appear exclusively in the title, signifying importance of the body.

Web users have a mental model of what current search engines can handle: most people tend to drop function words (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) when issuing queries [4] , perhaps believing those are of little importance in query effectiveness. These intuitions are substantiated by our measurements: content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) account for a total of 79% (47%, 15%, 13%, and 4%, respectively) of the query, while function words constitute only 21% of the query. For interpretability, we use the 12 Universal POS tags (UTS) 6 . Our findings partially concur with POS analysis of Yahoo! search queries from a decade back [4] where nouns and adjectives were observed to be the two most dominant tags; verbs featured in the seventh position with 2.4%. We believe that differences in our scenario can be attributed to more complex information needs that demand more content words to be present in queries.

A vital component of any crowdsourced study is to check if participants are looking for quick workarounds for assigned tasks that would make it hard for requesters to reject payments, and to control for confounding biases. In the current study, a major source of bias stems from the fact that a question is not just a sequence of words but a semi-structured concept (subforum, title, body.) Web users might be aware that question titles often summarize questions. Thus, if the structure is apparent to the annotator, they might use words only from titles without examining the full question content.",

Nevertheless, users may still be able to figure out that the first sentence is indeed the question title. To quantify such position bias of the title, we used ten HITs (500 questions) as a control experiment where, unknown to the Turkers, the title was appended as the last sentence in the question. These 500 questions were also annotated in the usual setup in the main study. We compare the main and the control studies by measuring how often users chose words from the first and the last sentences (Table 1 ). Values were normalized by the length of the question title, as raw counts could mislead the analysis (longer question titles contribute larger numbers of words to queries).",

Note that such high percentages are acceptable, as question titles typically do try to summarize intent. (ii) Relatively similar percentages of query words originate from titles in both cases (37.7% vs. 26.1%). (iii) If Turkers were trying to do the task just after skimming the first sentence (which they would perceive as the title), the percentage of words from the first sentence in the control would have been far higher than a paltry 12.2%, and the last sentence would contribute much lower than 26.1%. We also observed that in 4.1% of the cases, words were chosen exclusively from the last sentence. User Agreement. While the main focus of the study was to construct a sizable collection of question-query pairs, we were also interested in observing the effect of individual differences on query formulation. To this end, we issued ten HITs (each with fifty questions) completed by three workers each. The validity of the comparison comes from the experimental design where query construction is conditioned on a specific information need. We computed the average Jaccard similarity coefficient between all pairs of queries (q 1 , q 2 ) for the same question: J(q 1 , q 2 ) = |q1\u2229q2| |q1\u222aq2| , where q 1 and q 2 are the sets of words of the compared queries. We find the average overlap to be 0.33; the overlap was observed to typically arise from the most informative question words, again indicating generally correct task interpretation. Such query variability has been explored in [3] .",

From the 100 subjects in our study, coincidentally, female and male participation was exactly 50 : 50. Nearly all workers lived in the USA except for three who lived in India.
