Recently, a correlation between immunosuppression and reactivation of the two novel polyomaviruses has been suggested in immunocompromised patients [Mourez et al., 2009 ] and in AIDS patients at the molecular level [Sharp et al., 2009 ], but no evidence of a role of the viruses as opportunistic pathogens has been given. Overall, these data support the hypotesis that, in analogy with the BK and JC polyomaviruses, KIPyV and WUPyV can establish persistent infection, and that virus replication may increase in immunocompromised hosts. In this context, to clarify the pathogenic potential of the viruses, and the possible role of KIPyV and WUPyV as opportunistic pathogens, further studies on the extent of reactivation in patients with different immunodeficiency conditions may be useful.",

Indeed, recent studies of immunocompromised adults or patients hospitalized for severe, life threatening, acute respiratory disease have suggested that infection with WUPyV and KIPyV occurs early in childhood, and that these viruses may establish persistent infections with possible reactivations paralleling respiratory disease or other clinical conditions [Le et al., 2007; Abedi Kiasart et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2008] .",
