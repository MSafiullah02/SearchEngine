Annual seasonal outbreaks of influenza are caused by minor antigenic changes (antigenic drift) seen in influenza A and B viruses. Major changes in antigenic subtypes (antigenic shift) are only found in influenza A virus and typically involve the emergence of novel hemagglutinin (H) and/or neuraminidase (N) proteins on the viral envelope. Pandemic influenza occurs when a new influenza A strain emerges, to which the majority of the world's population has little or no immunity. There were three influenza pandemics in the last century, of which the pandemic in 1918 due to the H1N1 virus was the most severe. The first pandemic of this century occurred in 2009 [1] and was due to another H1N1 variant that emerged through a quadruple reassortment of viral RNAs derived from human, avian, Eurasian and North American swine influenza sources [2] . The presence of animal influenza subtypes, particularly avian influenza viruses such as H5N1, is of continuous concern, as these could be the source of future pandemics. Though with relatively high case-fatality rate, H5N1 avian influenza virus has so far only caused a limited number of human infections in restricted geographical locations with little evidence of human to human spread. However, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus proved to be a major burden for ICU staff [3] . Clinically, influenza infection is characterised by abrupt onset of fever, sore throat, myalgia, cough, headache and malaise. Young children may develop croup, pneumonia or middle ear infection. With seasonal influenza, complications are often seen in the elderly, the immunocompromised and those with pre-existing chronic heart or lung disease or diabetes. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, children and young adults were more susceptible [4] . Overall fatality rate was \\0.5%, but as many as 9-31% of hospitalised patients needed ICU admission [5] . Severe disease and high mortality rates were seen in pregnant women, patients with underlying medical pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neuromuscular illness and severe obesity, and those in whom the diagnosis and admission was delayed [6] [7] [8] . Respiratory failures could be caused by viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, secondary bacterial infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus (often methicillin resistant) were found in 20-24% of ICU patients and 26-38% of patients who died [3, 5, 9] . Fatal cases were often complicated by multiorgan failure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1402, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1845, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1951, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2190, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2194, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2198, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2505, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2508, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2511, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza Viruses"}, {"text": "Influenza has a short incubation time of 1-4 days.

An outbreak in an adult ICU (AICU) occurred as a result of inadequate precautions taken while handling bile of a patient not suspected of incubating hepatitis A [49] . Most other outbreaks occurred in PICUs or NICUs, with attack rates varying between 15 and 25%. Risk factors for outbreaks have been attributed to handling soiled bed pads, nappies or gowns of an index patient, failure to wash hands, and eating in the ICU. In the NICU, vertical transmission and blood transfusion have been implicated as the cause of infection in the index case. The effect of nosocomial hepatitis A infection varies from asymptomatic to classic presentation with acute hepatitis. Diagnosis is by serological detection of hepatitis-A-specific IgM. The use of molecular techniques such as RT-PCR can help identify early infection or in difficult cases, such as those with immunodeficiency. Sequencing of PCR products is useful in establishing epidemiological linkage during outbreaks. NHIG has been successfully used for postexposure prophylaxis to control outbreaks. There is now increasing evidence that hepatitis A vaccine can be used for prophylaxis if the contact occurs within 14 days from onset of illness in the index case [50] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1423, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis A Virus"}, {"text": "The most commonly encountered nosocomial blood-borne viruses are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The best way to prevent occupational exposure of blood-borne viruses is to practice universal precautions.

This encourages good and safe practice and helps prevent unnecessary accidents.

", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus"}, {"text": "Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are severe and life-threatening diseases caused by a range of viruses. They are either zoonotic or arthropod-borne infections and are often endemic in certain parts of the world. They are often highly infectious through close contact with infected blood and body fluid and therefore pose a significant risk of hospital-acquired infection. As many patients with VHF present with shock and require vigorous supportive treatment, it is a potential problem in the ICU. The major viruses of nosocomial concern in this setting are Marburg, Ebola, Rift Valley fever, Lassa and Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (Table 20 .7). The incubation period for these VHFs ranges from 3-21 days. Initial symptoms are often nonspecific but may eventually lead to haemorrhage and shock. Any febrile patient who has returned from an endemic area of one of the VHF agents or has a history of contact with cases suspected to have VHF within 3 weeks should be considered as at risk. However, malaria should always be excluded. A risk assessment needs to be performed, and any patient known or strongly suspected to be suffering from VHF should be admitted to a high-security infectious disease unit that is designed to manage these patients. While awaiting transfer to a secure unit, such patients should be placed in a negative-pressure room with strict source isolation. Specimens for patient management should be processed in a high-security laboratory designated for category 4 pathogens, and the aetiological agent established using PCR, serology and virus culture. All areas and materials in contact with infected patients should be autoclaved, incinerated or treated with hypochlorite (10,000 ppm of available chlorine). If the patient dies, the body should be placed in a sealable body bag sprayed or wiped with hypochlorite. Individuals who have been in contact with a case of VHF should be put under surveillance for 3 weeks. The successful i.v. use of ribavirin has been reported in some cases of VHFs (Lassa, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Hantaan). Apart from yellow fever, no vaccines are available. Shingles or zoster is the result of the reactivation of latent VZV (family Herpesviridae) in the dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia. The clinical presentation is a painful vesicular eruption covering the affected dermatome. The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed rapidly by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy or PCR of the cellular material obtained from a vesicular scraping. The infection is usually self-limiting but can be more severe in immunocompromised patients, in whom it may present over multiple dermatomes or as a disseminated infection. The latter cases should be managed as if they were chickenpox, and respiratory precautions for infection control have to be enforced. Patients or health care staff members with classic shingles are contagious from the day the rash appears until the lesions are crusted over. There is some risk of nosocomial transmission if the lesions are on exposed areas of the body or in immunocompromised infected patients.
