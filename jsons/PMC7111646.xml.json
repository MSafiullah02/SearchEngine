In that case, the fungus was indeed a biofactory in the sense that numerous compounds have been reported from the fungus. What is the situation with another FTCM, Cordyceps? The immediate answer is that the state of the art is considerably less developed (see Table 2\nfor a list of secondary metabolites). There is a general impression that this fungus is being used in a modern context, before the benefits, and even what is being used, have been determined scientifically. Cordyceps is one of a growing number of FTCM being considered as cures for modern human diseases. Many commercial products are available in the market (e.g. Didanosine from Cordyceps militaris). These nutraceuticals are considered to relieve the \u201cstress for humans of living in technologically developed societies\u201d by stimulating basic and secondary responses of the immune system (Lakhanpal and Rana, 2005).",

The genus contains over 400 species and the anamorphs of most are unknown. Paecilomyces is considered traditionally to host the anamorphs but this has been disputed. Sung et al. (2007) should be consulted for an up-to-date revision (and see later). Cordyceps are parasites of insects or fungi, often exhibiting a high degree of host specificity (Fig. 1\n). However, the Cordyceps species associated with Lepidopteran hosts do not represent a monophyletic group. There is even a high degree of genetic variation within Cordyceps sinensis which creates difficulties in verifying samples. A taxonomic review of the fungus is now available (see later section) a similar review is required for Ganoderma (e.g. see Paterson, 2006, Paterson, 2007). Larval infection via meiotic and/or mitotic spores/conidia and multiplication within the insect is from yeast-like budding. However, the fungus grows through the insect by hyphae. The accumulation of the biomass eventually kills the host (and/or a toxin(s) may be involved). It would be interesting to determine the biochemical parameters that cause these changes but this is not reported in the literature. The fungus ruptures the host body following over wintering and forms the sexual perithecial stroma that are connected to the dead larva below ground which grow upward to emerge above the soil surface (Fig. 1). The complete insect/fungus combination is used traditionally, but not exclusively, for medicinal purposes. The present reviewer has seen no reports of the insect per se being given as a treatment.",

The fungus parasitises larvae of moths (Lepidoptera), especially Hepialus armoricanus (and Thitarodes), and converts each larva into a sclerotium, from which the stroma and fruit-body grows. The complex (including the larva body) has been used as a health food and traditional medicine to \u201cinvigorate the lung and nourish the kidney\u201d in China for hundreds of years, and at least from the 17th century (Dong and Yao, 2007, Kuo et al., 1994). Although what these preparations actually represented is impossible to determine given the difficulties in taxonomy of even modern times (Burnett, 2003, Korf, 2005; and see Sung et al., 2007). Understandably, conservation and sustainable harvest are important issues. There is need for (a) research on biological screening, (b) a better understanding of the status in natural habitats, and (c) artificial cultivation of the fungus.",

The believe is that C. sinensis (CS) has various beneficial effects on humans, including those of a psychological nature. The FTCM, is also called Dong Chong Xia Cao in Chinese (=winter worm summer grass) (Li et al., 2006a). Primarily it is prescribed as a tonic for body strengthening after serious disease. More recently other treatments have been claimed such as for (a) respiratory, renal, liver, nervous system and cardiovascular diseases, and (b) tumours, aging, hyposexuality and hyperlipidemia (Kuo et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2006, Wang and Shiao, 2000). It has been officially classified as a drug in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1964. Furthermore, the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 has increased use considerably. This would have been an excellent opportunity to have determined how effective it was. However, this does not appear to have been undertaken. The market demand for CS is growing sharply in many countries (Dong and Yao, 2007). They would surely be hailed as medical breakthroughs if the efficacy of any of these treatments were confirmed. Nevertheless, the identities of active components have not been determined (in all cases) (Li et al., 2006b). Research has shown that at least some of the traditional uses \u201cmay\u201d relate to pharmacological activities (Zhu et al., 1998a, Zhu et al., 1998b) (if not pharmacological activities then what?). Herbs have been used throughout history to enhance physical performance, but scientific scrutiny with controlled clinical trials has only recently been used to study such effects (Bucci, 2000). The authors mention that Cordyceps remain untested which is surprising given the interest in the fungus.",

The fungus has officially been classified as an endangered species by CITES Management Authority of China and China Customers and this scarcity is of considerable concern to all. Consequently, living strains have been isolated from natural CS and cultivated in large quantity by bioreactor technology which is a promising method to meet the needs of human consumption and to reduce the pressure on natural resources of the species (Dong and Yao, 2007).",

Some other issues that require addressing are that natural C. militaris is not readily available and is costly. Thus, a growing number of so-called Cordyceps products that derive from mycelial cultures of the asexual forms of these fungi have become commercially available (Hamburger, 2007). Mycelia cultivation has resulted in establishing a number of cultures derived from the holomorphic CS. These are referred to by the anamorphic names Paecilomyces hepiali and Cephalosporium sinensis, although the anamorph of CS appears to be Hirsutella sinensis (and see later). However, the situation is confused with some taxonomist using outdated names. To paraphrase Buenz et al., 2004, Buenz et al., 2005: while these strains undoubtedly support ecologically sustainable use of CS, the actual similarities between the wild fungus and the cultures are not clear.",

An important factor was the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994 in the USA which opened the market for TCM (Cooper and Chang, 2001). One can appreciate how journals advocating these have increased concomitantly. Why have they not been developed by big pharmaceutical companies and made available to the public in pure compound form? No doubt there could be many reasons why this has not happened (e.g. not enough profit, \u201csticky\u201d intellectual property rights issues (see Paterson, 2008), difficulty in mass production or synthesis, etc.) \u2013 apart from the possibility that they simply may not be effective. Buenz et al. mention that \u201cone of the most interesting supplements is the not yet well-characterized C. sinensis (Berk.) Sacc.\u201d.",

In fact, it was later proved to be a different species (Dong and Yao, 2007) and this is a specific example of a general problem in the field.

However, other groups have not been able to detect this compound (Shiao et al., 1994). It is clearly important to confirm the presence of the compound in CS in terms of determining the active components of the fungus and ultimately for chemotaxonomic purposes. Cho et al. (2007) state that cordycepin is isolated from C. militaris and is (claimed to be) an ingredient in TCM which is prescribed for various diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammation (again note how vague this verbatim statement is). In this study, the novel effect of cordycepin inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation was reported. The data suggests that the inhibitory effect of cordycepin might be associated with the down-regulation of [Ca2+]i and the elevation of cAMP/cGMP production. This result has obvious significance for prevention of thrombus formation. Finally, cordycepin inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma cells inoculated subcutaneously into right murine footpads (Yoshikawa et al., 2004).",

The authors are vague as to what the compound is and state that, \u201cit is a kind of ergosterol and looks like testosterone\u201d. The authors also provide a chemical structure which confirms that it is a common sterol and a systematic name could have been provided. Their results demonstrated that mice treated daily exhibited a progressive reduction in anti-ds-DNA production. In clinical presentation, the treated group had a reduction in lymphadenopathy, a delayed progression of proteinuria, and an improvement in kidney function. Histological analysis of kidney tissue indicated that H1-A inhibited mesangial proliferation that was evident in lupus nephritis. However, there was no change in immune complex deposition. H1-A \u201cmay be\u201d useful for treating systemic lupus erythematosus in human patients. However, more work is required. H1-A was claimed to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune disorders (Yang et al., 2003). Results demonstrated inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis of activated human mesangial cells in vitro: the activities were not a result of cytotoxicity. In addition, H1-A inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of human mesangial proteins. These findings suggest that H1-A modulated some (unspecific) subcellular signal-transduction pathways and changed the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of mesangial cells in vitro and in vivo. The conclusions were that H1-A may be effective in the management of autoimmune disorders, and the modulation of the signal-transduction proteins may represent a target for future pharmacologic interventions. More correctly, they probably do represent a target, and such vague statements should be avoided. In an older report, HI-A alleviated immunoglobulin A nephropathy (Berger\u2019s disease) with histological and clinical improvement (Lin et al., 1999). HI-A inhibited the proliferation of human mesangial cells and promoted apoptosis by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (Yang et al., 2003) and reduced anti-ds-DNA production and lymphadenopathy, delayed progression of proteinuria, improved kidney function and inhibited mesangial proliferation (Yang et al., 1999).",

CMESS showed a potent inhibitory activity of 34.7% in starch-loaded mice: CMESS reduced blood glucose level by 35.5%. However, CCCA, and cordycepin showed no difference. After 7 days administrations of these drugs, CMESS, and cordycepin dramatically reduced blood glucose level. CCCA with a high concentration of cordycepin did not reduce blood glucose level. Proliferation of T-lymphocyte was significantly decreased; while NO production was increased more than two-fold in the cordycepin-administered group. The proliferation of macrophages and NO production were significantly decreased in the CMESS administered group. CMESS and cordycepin may be (a) useful tools in the control of blood glucose level in diabetes and (b) promising new drugs as an anti-hyperglycemic agent without the defects of lowered immune responses and other side effects, the authors suggest.",

The exopolysaccharide fraction of CS inhibited metastasis of melanoma cells and down-regulated concomitantly the levels of Bcl-2 protein into the lungs and the liver (Zhang et al., 2005).",

However, this study provoked a strong response from Hamburger (2007) which was subsequently rebutted by one of the original authors (Duh, 2007). This is something of an unexpected bonus to a reviewer of the literature such as myself as another opinion is obtained. The questions are, what biological material is being worked with, and can other scientists obtain it to repeat the experiment? The current author has encountered this before (Paterson, 2005) where commercial interests are involved. The Hamburger response can be applied in a general sense to some of the other work cited in the present review. CME and CSE showed weakly inhibitory effect on liposome oxidation. The inhibitory effect of CME on protein oxidation was inferior to that of CSE. CME and CSE showed inhibition of LDL oxidation. The contents of the bioactive ingredients cordycepin and adenosine in CME were higher than those of CSE; however, cordycepin and adenosine showed no significant anti-oxidant activity. In addition, a polysaccharide present in CME and CSE displayed anti-oxidant activity. The authors concluded that the protective effects of CME and CSE against oxidative damage of biomolecules are a result of their free radical scavenging abilities. However, the experimental data and some of the conclusions need a critical comment (Hamburger, 2007). The author criticised the report on the bases of poor taxonomy, biochemistry and extrapolation of data to imply possible cures of diseases. In particular, the authors\u2019 claims of a potential treatment for human disease on the basis of in vitro data are called into question. The rebuttal by Duh simply confirms that appropriate information about the strains was not provided; the comments on the inadequate analytical procedures are largely accepted. And there is no doubt that the conclusions could have been rewritten to indicate that the results were preliminary. Hamburger (personal communication, 2007) stated that the rebuttal was evasive, an assessment with which I agree.",

A hot-water extract of mycelia (a) lowered the total cholesterol concentration, (b) reduced the concentration of cholesterol carried by LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein, and (c) elevated the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration in the serum of mice fed a cholesterol enriched diet (Koh et al., 2003a). Water extracts of CS: increased survival time of mice inoculated with carcinoma cells or syngeneic fibrosarcoma cells (Yoshida et al., 1989); inhibited spontaneously liver metastasis of carcinoma cells and melanoma in syngeneic mice and results suggested that the activity was not attributable to cordycepin (Nakamura et al., 1999a); prolonged the survival period of mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells when coadministered with methotrexate (Nakamura et al., 2003) and caused apoptosis of melanoma cells (Nakamura et al., 1999b).",

These extracts \u201cmay have\u201d beneficial effects on the process of atherogenesis and aging with few side effects (Yamaguchi et al., 2000a). This is good news but surely more evidence is required. Towards these ends, Tsai et al. (2001) also demonstrated the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of CS. Whereas reduced lipid peroxidation in rats was demonstrated by Shen and Chen (2001). Antioxidant activity in the xanthine oxidase, haemolysis and lipid peroxidation assay systems was reported from water extracts, and a polysaccharide fraction, of cultured CS mycelia (Li et al., 2001a). As mentioned previously, the fruiting body and the caterpillar parts of CS are claimed to be similar in chemical composition and hence anti-oxidant activity (Li et al., 2002). It would be interesting to determine (a) how this occurs in terms of insect substrate utilisation by the fungus with a view to optimising yields of bioactive fungal components, (b) when the preparation is at the correct stage for use as a medicinal treatment, and (c) if these data could be extrapolated to in vitro culture. Cho et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2005 also reported radical scavenging activity with Wang et al. reporting activity against colorectal tumour cells.",

The phagocytosis of macrophages were enhanced significantly (Jia and Lau, 1997) and \u201cmaybe\u201d the tonic effect of CS is accomplished by an enhancing effect on the immune system. Some chemical fractions had insulin like and insulin release promoting activity and \u201ccould be developed\u201d as an anti-diabetic agent (Young et al., 2001). Cordyceps possessed a strong anti-oxidation activity in all assays tested by Li et al. (2001a). The cultured Cordyceps mycelia had equally strong anti-oxidation activity compared to in vivo Cordyceps. Further, the anti-oxidation activities were increased \u00d710\u201330 in the partially purified polysaccharide fractions. In an intriguing report, Liu et al. (2006) mentions that identification of an effective non-toxic biological radioactivity protector is a \u201cmatter of some urgency\u201d. Orally administered CS protected mice from bone marrow and intestinal injuries after total-body irradiation. The levels of free radical species within cells are suggested to be a likely mechanism for the purported effects. The biochemical mechanisms of anti-proliferative effects of C. militaris in human leukemia cells were investigated in a convincing study involving cancer treatment (Park et al., 2005). It was found that they inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with morphological change and apoptotic cell death such as formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, the treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (see Paterson, 2008) and prostaglandin E2 accumulation. Taken together, these results indicated that the anti-proliferative effects were associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death through regulation of several major growth regulatory gene products. The extracts \u201cmay have therapeutic potential\u201d in human leukemia treatment. In addition, corticosterone output by cultured rat adrenocortical cells was increased without increasing the intracellular cAMP level. The steroidogenic effect was abolished by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, indicating that its action may involve stimulation of protein kinase C (Wang et al., 1998). C. militaris reduced the fasting serum glucose level and enhances glucose utilisation in skeletal muscles in rats (Choi et al., 2004). The fungus demonstrated cytotoxic activities on the three kinds of human cancer cell lines, stomachic adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lim et al., 2004). Cytotoxic activity-guided isolation and identification of active fractions afforded the well-known, cordycepin as an active component (see above).",

It represents a bizarre rational for undertaking the work and it is surprising that it was published from a scientific perspective. The rational for the work is that CS is a popular Chinese tonifying herb, and was/is revered for being, what is referred to as, \u2018Yin-nourishing\u2019 and \u2018Yang-invigorating\u2019 in Chinese medicine (Siu et al., 2004). In order to establish the pharmacological basis for the \u2018Yin-nourishing\u2019 and \u2018Yang-invigorating\u2019 action of Cordyceps, the effects of wild and cultured Cordyceps on concanavalin A stimulated splenocytes, an in vitro bioassay for \u2018Yin-nourishment\u2019, and myocardial ATP generation capacity, an ex vivo bioassay for \u2018Yang-invigoration\u2019, were investigated in mice. The results indicated that wild and cultured Cordyceps enhanced the Con A-stimulated splenocyte proliferation in vitro and myocardial mitochondrial ATP generation ex vivo in mice, with no significant difference in potency of action between the two types of Cordyceps. While the immunopotentiating effect was associated with the increase in interleukin-2 production, the stimulation of myocardial ATP generation was paralleled by an enhancement in mitochondrial electron transport. When compared with typical \u2018Yin\u2019 and \u2018Yang\u2019 tonifying Chinese herbs, Cordyceps was found to possess both \u2018Yin-nourishing\u2019 and \u2018Yang-invigorating\u2019 activities, with a lower potency in both modes of action. It is impossible to take reports such as these seriously from a scientific standpoint and is given considerable space here to indicate a general problem which may have motivated some of the published reports reviewed herein. This is without attempting to detract from the philosophical aspects of the concepts of Yin and Yang in terms of two mutually correlated opposites in a general sense. A comprehensive definition of the corresponding philosophy of science is inappropriate: It is enough to state that it is vitally important for science that the information about the surrounding world and the objects of study be as accurate and as reliable as possible.",

Neither fraction was cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive ingredients were found to be intracellular. Fruiting bodies inhibited human mesangial cells (HMC) activation by IL-1 plus IL-6 (Lin et al., 1999) and liver toxicity or mutagenicity were not observed. The fraction was purified to obtain purified compound H1-A (see above). The authors claim a novel treatment for human Berger\u2019s disease \u201cin the future\u201d. A fraction (a) dose dependently suppressed bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) cells proliferation, (b) reduced interleukin production in LPS activated BALF cell cultures and (c) affected interleukin mRNAs in various significant manners (Kuo et al., 2001). The purported therapeutic activity may be related to modulation of cells functions in bronchial airways. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of Cordyceps pruinosa pharmacological and biochemical actions of macrophages in inflammation has not been clearly elucidated (Kim et al., 2003a). The authors suggest that an extract suppresses inflammation through suppression of NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory gene expression, and hence may be beneficial for treatment of endotoxin shock or sepsis.",

Overall, the results demonstrated that C. cicadae contained growth modulators for HMNC. Unfortunately, the compounds responsible were not characterised. Koh et al.

Concomitantly, several major events in the mitochondrial signal pathway occurred, including (a) the loss of MTP, (b) cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, (c) the decrease in Bcl-2 protein level, (d) the translocation of Bax protein from cytoplasm into mitochondria, and (e) the activation of caspase-2, -3, and -9. However, caspase-8, the initiator caspase in the death receptor pathway, was not activated. These results suggest that CSME induces apoptosis in HL-60 cell through the mitochondrial pathway rather than the death receptor pathway.",

These authors investigated the effects of intragastrically administered Cordyceps sp. for alleviating fasting hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. Animals had significantly increased serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and blood urea nitrogen, and significantly decreased body weight, serum albumin levels and weights of the thymus, lungs and gastrocnemius muscle compared to animals in the control group. In addition, blood glucose was significantly increased compared to the control group; these results suggest that enterally administered Cordyceps sp. has potential anti-hyperglycemic ability.

Zhang and Xia (1990) demonstrated immunosuppressant effects in the heterotropic heart allograft model in rats and determined that prolonged survival periods were possible. Also, Zhu and Yu (1990) found prolonged mouse skin allograft survival time. The number of T helper cells was increased, as were Lyt-1/Lyt-2 (T helper cells to T suppressor cells) in peripheral blood and spleen (Chen et al., 1991). A mitogenic action was demonstrated on splenic lymphocytes and interleukin-2 from spleen cells of rats with chronic renal failure was augmented (Cheng, 1992). In addition, natural killer cell activity was enhanced (Xu et al., 1992). Treatment of patients with post-hepatic cirrhosis resulted in (a) enhancement of natural killer cell function, (b) increased number and improved ratio of CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe cells, and (c) reduction in IgA and IgG levels (Zhu and Liu, 1992). Treatment of chronic hepatitis B resulted in increased CD4/CD8 ratios, and reductions in hyaluronic acid and procollagen type III. The data indicate the usefulness of the fungus in adjusting the level of T lymphocyte subsets and treating hepatic fibrosis (Gong et al., 2000). Liu et al. (1992) demonstrated increased peripheral natural killer cell activity from healthy subjects and leukaemia patients. Improved renal function and augmented cellular immune function in chronic renal failure has also been observed (Guan et al., 1992). The fruiting body portion, but not the carcass portion, of Cordyceps reduced weight loss, polydipsia and hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats (Lo et al., 2004).",

Yang et al. (2006) mention that mycelium can inhibit tumour growth and induce tumour cell apoptosis. However, the antitumour mechanisms are not fully understood.

The ability to inhibit apoptosis has emerged as an important potential therapy (e.g. cancer). There are reports of CS extracts inhibiting and inducing apoptosis (Shahed et al., 2001); this is not contradictory but allows a foundation to determine the molecular mechanism of activity. Indeed, Cordyceps may contain compounds that inhibit apoptosis; however, conflicting evidence has been obtained. The fungus can scavenge reactive oxygen species by inhibiting malondialdehyde formation by SIN-1, the peroxynitrite generator, which has been confirmed by xanthine oxidase, hemolysis, and lipid peroxidation assays. Furthermore, an isolated extract of CS, H1-A (this is reported as a pure compound (see above), inhibited induced apoptosis, by permeabilizing the cell membrane and upregulating nitric oxide synthase (Trubiani et al., 2003). On the other hand, extracts of CS did not inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis (Buenz et al., 2004), in a reactive oxygen species model (Fauconneau et al., 2002). Alternatively, CS down-regulated apoptotic genes and modulated apoptosis in a rat kidney ischemia reperfusion model.",

Furthermore, cancer chemotherapeutics have involved the ability to induce apoptosis. Hence the polysaccharide fraction (H1-A) induced apoptosis by inhibiting (a) phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and (b) apoptosis induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (Yang et al., 2003).

The issues of anamorph/teleomorph associations are relevant here. For example, epicoccins A\u2013D were isolated from cultures of a Cordyceps-colonizing isolate of Epicoccum nigrum (Zhang et al., 2007b). Gliocladinins A and B are of an isolate of Gliocladium sp. that colonized CS (Guo et al., 2007). It is essential that such activity is differentiated from that obtained from the traditional medicine or Cordyceps per se. In a series of papers, (a) Paecilomyces militaris is shown to possess militarinones A, B, C, D and (b) farinosomes and a deoxymilitarinone substance were detected from Paecilomyces farinosus (Schmidt et al., 2002, Schmidt et al., 2003, Cheng et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2006). The authors do not make statements as to the holomophic connections to Cordyceps. Hamburger (2007) does make this link to C. militaris (teleomorph) from P. militaris (anamorph) apparently on the basis of the same pigment production. However, it is has been suggested that Paecilomyces does not contain anamophic species of Cordyceps (Chen et al., 2001). Hence, comment on these reports is avoided by the current author because the relationships between Paecilomyces and Cordyceps remain ill-defined.",

Could the activity be greater at these stages? The accumulation of bioactive plant metabolites by insects is well documented (Brown and Trigo, 1994) and insects are used as medicines (Zhao et al., 2007). These aspects are almost totally ignored in the case of the medicinal Cordyceps. It appears as if entomologists have simply not been involved in the field. Does the insect have to be dead before the system works or are more active components produced by the fungus as it is in the process of killing the insect? Research into these factors could be fruitful.",

The fruiting body portion, but not the carcass portion, of Cordyceps reduced weight loss, polydipsia and hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats (Lo et al., 2004). Aqueous methanol extracts of C. cicadae ascocarps enhanced human mononuclear cells (HMNC) proliferation (Weng et al., 2002). In contrast, the methanol (100%) extracts of the C. cicadae insect-body portion suppressed HMNC proliferation. Interestingly, the ergosterol esters concentrations were much higher in the (dead) caterpillar than the fruiting bodies (Yuan et al., 2007) although ergosterol was similar. Finally, the fruiting body and the caterpillar parts of CS are claimed to be similar in chemical composition and hence anti-oxidant activity because the fungus had presumable replaced the insect constituents with fungal (Li et al., 2002).",

Diabetic rats had significantly lower weight gain and higher blood glucose response in oral glucose tolerance test than the control rats; and these changes were significantly reduced by administrating the fruiting body of Cordyceps.

This was not done in the paper Hamburger (2007) comments upon. Fermentations were performed in flasks and in 5-L stirred-tank bioreactors. The concentrations of mycelial biomass, EPS and cordycepin achieved in submerged culture of C. militaris were higher than those of CS. As the authors claim, comparative studies between the two fungi are not available and the paper was the first report on the optimum medium composition for submerged culture of CS. Cordyceps nutans Pat. is another entomopathogenitic Ascomycete belonging to the family Clavicipitaceae which is parasitic on hemipteran insects (Sasaki et al., 2005). Very few investigations have been made with this fungus. In this research, optimum temperature and pH for mycelial growth was determined. However, it appeared that growth remained low and commercial exploitation perhaps limited. However, it would be interesting to include this species in any future taxonomic treatments of the genus. Optimisation of culture conditions for mycelial growth and production of polysaccharides and cordycepin were described by Park et al., 2001b, Park et al., 2002, Xu et al., 2002, Kim et al., 2003b, Kim et al., 2003c, Xiao et al., 2004, Mao and Zhong, 2004, Hsieh et al., 2005, although cordycepin is usually produced synthetically at present.",

However, in a most impressive paper, Sung et al. (2007) state that Cordyceps comprise over 400 species in their modern phylogenetic classification of Cordyceps and the clavicipitaceous fungi. Cordyceps Fr. host range is broad, ranging from 10 orders of arthropods to the truffle-like genus Elaphomyces, although most species are restricted to a single host species or closely related host species. The main objectives of the study was to reassess the (a) morphological traits used currently, (b) taxonomic utility of the anamorphic forms and (3) classification in relation to phylogenetic relationships. It may be worth mentioning that PCRs may be subjected to inhibition, and nucleic acids may be affected by the medium in which the fungus was grown (see Paterson, 2007, Paterson, 2008). Unfortunately, Sung et al. (2007) do not provide details of how the fungi were grown for analysis and so it is difficult to conjecture. Obviously, as discussed in this review, the fungus produces numerous bioactive compounds which may be inhibitors or mutagens and the effect of metabolite production on the DNA preparations need to be determined or misleading results may be obtained.",

            "text": "However, to continue, it is worth mentioning that C. militaris maintains its name in the study while C. sinensis is now classified as Ophiocordyceps sinensis. The taxon was historically classified in the Clavicipitaceae, based on cylindrical asci, thickened ascus apices and filiform ascospores, which often disarticulate into part-spores. The fungus was characterized by having a pathological ecology on Elaphomyces and arthropods, with infrageneric classifications emphasizing ascospore morphology, host affiliation and arrangement of perithecia. The production of well-developed often stipitate stromata was typical. Sung et al. re-classified on the basis of phylogenetic relationships between 162 taxa by employing five to seven genetic loci. Three clavicipitaceous clades were determined which rejected the monophyly of Cordyceps and Clavicipitaceae and most diagnostic characters used in Cordyceps were not supported as being phylogenetically informative. However, the most consistent characters with the phylogeny were pigmentation, morphology and morphology of stromata. Cordycipitaceae was validated based on C. militaris, the type of Cordyceps, which included most Cordyceps species that possess bright, fleshy stromata. The new family Ophiocordycipitaceae was proposed. The majority of species here produce stromata that often possess aperithecial apices and are darkly pigmented, tough to pliant. Elaphocordyceps was proposed for a subclade of the Ophiocordycipitaceae, which includes species of Cordyceps that parasitize (a) the fungal genus Elaphomyces and (b) arthropods. The family Clavicipitaceae included the core clade of grass symbionts, and the entomopathogenic genus Hypocrella and relatives. The new genus Metacordyceps is proposed for Cordyceps species that are closely related to the grass symbionts in the Clavicipitaceae s. s. Metacordyceps includes teleomorphs linked to Metarhizium and other closely related anamorphs. Lists of accepted names for species in Cordyceps, Elaphocordyceps, Metacordyceps and Ophiocordyceps are provided. Obviously, this work needs to be consulted in future work on the fungus for medicinal properties as does Stadler et al. (2003).",

This needs to be avoided as it falsely raises hopes for cures for serious diseases. Furthermore, there are no biochemical data on how the insect are converted into fungal components, or if the insect host per se has pharmacological properties. Poor (i.e. inadequate or obsolete) biochemical procedures and assays can also be cause problems (see Hamburger, 2007). The biological material being used often is not well characterised and there are few indications of specimens being available for other workers to repeat the described work for example (i.e. no voucher specimens are available), with some notable exceptions. A rather limited range of solvents have been employed to extract the components and, for example, chloroform/methanol is particularly efficacious for fungal compounds (e.g. Paterson and Bridge, 1994). There is very little on the use of non-polar solvents. Paterson et al., 2004, Paterson, 2006, Paterson, 2008 have advocated a method which may have utility in standardising bioactive fungi. In this scheme, a \u201ccommon, readily identifiable\u201d morphological character is determined and then the fungus is analyzed for particular metabolites. In this case the steps may be:1.Produces stroma on Lepidopteron insects.2.Produces detectable concentrations of, for example, cordycepin.\n",
