            "text": "| Antibacterial resistance is a great concern and requires global action. A critical question is whether enough new antibacterial drugs are being discovered and developed. A review of the clinical antibacterial drug pipeline was recently published, but comprehensive information about the global preclinical pipeline is unavailable. This Review focuses on discovery and preclinical development projects and has found, as of 1 May 2019, 407 antibacterial projects from 314 institutions. The focus is on Gram-negative pathogens, particularly bacteria on the WHO priority bacteria list. The preclinical pipeline is characterized by high levels of diversity and interesting scientific concepts, with 135 projects on direct-acting small molecules that represent new classes, new targets or new mechanisms of action. There is also a strong trend towards non-traditional approaches, including diverse antivirulence approaches, microbiome-modifying strategies, and engineered phages and probiotics. The high number of pathogen-specific and adjunctive approaches is unprecedented in antibiotic history. Translational hurdles are not adequately addressed yet, especially development pathways to show clinical impact of nontraditional approaches. The innovative potential of the preclinical pipeline compared with the clinical pipeline is encouraging but fragile. Much more work , focus and funding are needed for the novel approaches to result in effective antibacterial therapies to sustainably combat antibacterial resistance.",

            "text": "Resistance to antibiotics is a natural phenomenon that has been noted since the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s 1 . Whenever clinically relevant resistance has emerged, the problem has been tackled with modification of existing antibiotic classes with limited crossresistance to existing drugs or introduction of new classes 2 . The relative ease of the early antibiotic discovery programmes and the financial rewards that followed created a wasteful and uncritical use of antibiotics without adequate consideration of the societal consequences 3 . After this 'golden antibiotic era' , large pharmaceutical companies faced major scientific challenges searching for new antibiotics, especially with regard to penetration barriers and efflux mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria requiring high antibiotic doses with potential associated toxicity issues 4 . These companies finally abandoned antibacterial drug discovery activities beginning in the 1980s. Furthermore, they lost interest in a field that did not promise ever-increasing market growth and profits. Exits by large pharmaceutical companies have caused concern among scientists, the health-care community, civil society advocates and policymakers 5, 6 . Because of the long timelines for research and development, urgently needed responses and action can be calibrated only by knowing the global activities (and lack of activities) in antibacterial drug development. This mapping activity was initiated by the WHO with a recently published global clinical antibacterial pipeline report 7 . In contrast to the clinical pipeline, less is known about the preclinical antibacterial pipeline. In this Review, we analyse the preclinical antibacterial pipeline and provide a current snapshot and decision support for all actors in this field and some information on the broader context.",

Most academic institutions were excluded as their projects were not advanced enough to meet the inclusion criteria. Very few global pharmaceutical corporations have active clinical development programmes according to their published pipelines (for example, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Medimmune/AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche). Most of these companies are not active in preclinical antibacterial research and development, although it is possible that the companies are especially adept at keeping their programmes confidential and did not apply for funding. The large pharmaceutical companies (more than 1,000 employees) included in this study and engaging in preclinical antibacterial research and development are mainly located in Asia and Europe and have a regional focus. From our review of the data, these particular preclinical projects do not represent a renaissance in interest by large companies in antibiotic resistance. Therefore, SMEs carry out the great majority of the pipeline, with few employees and dependence on one programme or technology. This vulnerability is commonly characterized not only by a narrow set of expertise and dependence on the success of a single or a few similar prioritized projects, but also by the need for continued flow of funding, mostly grants, as private funding is relatively modest in preclinical antibacterial research and development. This situation causes high volatility of the number of SMEs and threatens the stability of the early pipeline.",

No projects from JPIamR could be included because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The data span from September 2016 to February 2019 and all data were updated if possible, with a cut-off date of 1 may 2019. In the case of overlapping data, the most recent update was used. The sources for updates were confidential personal communication, scientific abstracts, company websites, press releases and scientific and commercial publications. Whereas the JPIamR, eNaBle and RePaIR Impact Fund data were restricted geographically, the data from CeFaIa and CaRB-X were global in scope. Institutions were categorized as small and medium-sized enterprises (fewer than 1,000 employees), large companies (more than 1,000 employees), academic and other publicly funded institutes, supported by philanthropic organizations or non-profit institutions, and public-private partnerships. Companies and universities were counted as a single institution even if they have subsidiaries in different countries or different departments within a university. Israel was included in europe for categorization purposes owing to the strong research ties. The inclusion criteria require the project to target bacterial infections and to be in the discovery (hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases ending with declaring a preclinical candidate) and preclinical development phases for submission of an application for clinical trial authorization (CTa) or an investigational new drug application (IND), often called 'CTa/IND-enabling studies'. Duplicates of programmes due to collaborations, acquisitions or licensing were eliminated. Projects were included only if the product had not had a first dose in humans before 1 may 2019 as evidenced by the aforementioned sources for updates and public clinical trial registries. also excluded were antibacterial products for non-human uses, diagnostics, medical devices, conventional vaccines not focused on resistant pathogens (such as vaccines against pneumococci, meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae), new formulations and delivery methods of approved drugs (unless they allow new antibacterial use that was not possible before), projects for label expansion of a product already marketed or in clinical development, immunomodulators if not developed for a specific bacterial disease, wound care products unless used as a first model to assess the potential for other clinical indications, disinfectants and antibacterial ions. all data on institutions and their programmes were anonymized and aggregated to prevent tracking of data to specific companies or projects, as some companies request confidentiality during preclinical stages.",

            "text": "direct-acting drugs can be further classified into three groups: improved derivatives of known antibiotic classes (old targets), new chemical classes with new targets and unknown or undefined agents with unclear targets (Fig. 4a ). The group of old targets (n = 35, 19%) includes \u03b2-lactams and other inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins, fluoroquinolones and novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, polymyxins and macrolides 16 . One hundred and thirty-five projects (72%) are focused on new targets, including synthetic and natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), natural products and LpxC inhibitors (as discussed below). Other new targets include new binding sites in the bacterial ribosome, the membrane, the cell wall, transcription and/or translation, gene interference and metabolism [17] [18] [19] [20] . Some of these targets and scaffolds were described a long time ago but were not pursued to clinical development. Seventeen projects involving direct-acting agents could not be grouped due to insufficient information. Almost half of the projects are focused broadly on Gram-negative bacteria (enterobacteria and non-fermenters), and ~10% are focused on Gram-positive bacteria (mostly staphylococci), which are not a critical priority according to the WHO priority list 21 . The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is an effective barrier to molecules that need to penetrate the outer and inner membranes. Therefore, the scientific challenges for targets residing in the cytoplasm or inner membrane are greater than those for novel targets located in the periplasm or in the outer membrane. Not surprisingly, there is a noticeable trend towards targets in the outer membrane in preclinical projects. As mentioned before, in early drug discovery the spectrum of activity cannot be defined exactly and may change during the lead optimization phase. About 22% of the projects involve pathogen-specific approaches (mostly against Gram-negative bacteria) and thus face specific challenges to recruit enough patients for phase iii trials compared with trials of drugs with a broader spectrum. About 10% of the projects have a broad spectrum covering a broad range of both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 4b) .",

            "text": "Within the group of direct-acting compounds, three defined clusters are noticeable: synthetic or natural AMPs, natural products and LpxC inhibitors. The naturally abundant and diverse AMPs are a well-known group of antibacterials and are the basis for semisynthetic peptide molecules and peptidomimetics 18, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Such renewed interest in this group may help to overcome some of the obstacles of AMPs such as high cost of synthesis, short half-life in vivo due to their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and issues with toxicity 26 . Natural products are mainstays of our current antibiotic arsenal, exemplified by the large group of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides. Modern technologies such as genome mining contribute to the discovery of new scaffolds, and technical innovations are revealing new chemistry and increased yields, all of which contribute to the revival of natural product programmes [27] [28] [29] . LpxC inhibitors, which target the first dedicated step in the synthesis of lipid A, have been explored since the mid-1990s but no drug has advanced yet beyond phase I clinical trials. Development of ACHN-975 was discontinued after a phase I trial, owing to local inflammation at the injection site and some toxicity signals in the mouse model [30] [31] [32] . A trial involving RC-01, another LpxC inhibitor, was recently terminated for safety reasons 33 . Despite LpxC being a good target, toxicity of the used chemical matter seems to be a major challenge, but a growing body of knowledge and experience may help to overcome some of the current hurdles, including recent donations facilitated by CARB-X of toxicology data on the recently failed LpxC inhibitor into the public domain (the Shared Platform for Antibiotic Research and Knowledge (SPARK), Pew Trusts). In general, novel targets or novel chemicals carry the risk of unpredictable toxicity, because the translatability of safety signals from preclinical models to humans is uncertain, as exemplified by the aforementioned LpxC inhibitor RC-01 (ReF. 32 ). The recent termination of the phase III clinical trial of the novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific LptD inhibitor murepavadin due to higher than expected rates of acute kidney injury demonstrates the challenges of unexpected toxicity of a new chemical that was not predicted from earlier preclinical studies or from studies in healthy individuals 34 . Potentiators. Potentiators are drugs that have no or insufficient antibacterial activity alone but transform, restore or augment the activity of another antibiotic. Well-known examples include \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors 35, 36 ; of note, there are no approved inhibitors that include metallo-\u00df-lactamases 37 . Twelve projects are focused on inhibiting \u03b2-lactamases, including metallo-\u03b2-lactamases ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Some of the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are planned to be delivered orally. Although extensively researched, no inhibitor of various efflux pumps 38 has been clinically developed so far 39 . Five efflux inhibitors targeting different efflux pumps are included in this list of potentiators. Other approaches in the preclinical pipeline are potentiators that expand the spectrum (for example, developing Gram-negative activity from anti-Gram-positive drugs), enhance the activity substantially, restore the activity against resistant bacteria or protect against nephrotoxicity of nephrotoxic antibiotics, such as colistin or aminoglycosides.",

Compassionate use of personalized phage preparations is limited to specific clinical circumstances and individual physicians and researchers who have experience with phage therapy 42 . Patient-specific phage cocktails allow the use for rare pathogens, whereas recombinant lysins may cover a broader spectrum of Gram-negative bacteria. Although phages have been used historically in topical formulations (mostly skin) 43 , phage preparations are being developed for intravenous, aerosol or diverse locally applied formulations 44 . The immense size of phages compared with small-molecule antibiotics poses pharmacokinetic challenges, and important scientific questions remain regarding availability at the site of infection and determining the best dosing regimen 45 . In general, natural and engineered phage cocktails dominate our sample. New genetic tools such as CRISPR-Cas systems are used to genetically engineer phages that infect diverse hosts 46 . Phages are also used as species-specific carriers for a variety of potential antibacterial payloads 47 or CRISPR-Cas-based RNA-guided nucleases targeted at resistance or virulence determinants 48, 49 . Considerable progress has been made recently in tackling the great challenges in the chemistry, manufacturing and control of therapeutic phages, especially in production, stability, purity and quality control. However, challenges remain, such as unique phage biology and specificity, pharmacokinetics of large self-replicating agents, rapid resistance development and translation to a broader group of patients beyond compassionate use 8 . Also, patientspecific phage therapy requires a highly developed diagnostic infrastructure (with phage-specific rapid testing). Phage therapies will likely be restricted to well-defined situations in individual patients or as adjunctive therapy with all the challenges related to clinical superiority trials that compare a usually highly effective standard of care and adjunctive therapy versus standard of care alone 50, 51 .",

Such programmes have recently faced a setback as one patient died because of faecal transplants that contained drug-resistant bacteria 58 and led to the halting of clinical trials by the FDA. It is not fully known yet how this incident will affect regulation by the FDA and consequently the entire field of faecal transplants or similar strategies.

New techniques based on synthetic biology and systems biology allow the precise genetic engineering of well-known probiotics 61 , which may also express specific antibacterial substances [62] [63] [64] . A long-known strategy to maintain a healthy microbiota is the use of antibiotic inactivators or absorbers of bacterial toxins in the gut. Examples include enzymes that inactivate residues of specific systemic antibiotics in the gut to reduce disbalance of the microbiota caused by antibiotic therapy or absorbers of bacterial toxins that may cause disease, such as toxins produced by C. difficile or other pathogens 64, 65 .

The pipelines are highly fragile in SMEs for many reasons. Major basic scientific challenges such as penetration, efflux and the associated risk of toxicity owing to required high doses need an expanded concerted research agenda to advance discovery efforts for traditional antibiotics. A large proportion of high-risk approaches have yet unknown ability to translate into clinical beneficial potential, which may reduce future viable clinical pipelines. Basic scientific and translational challenges cannot be solved by individual small companies and will require huge collaborative efforts of the entire drug discovery community. Clear clinical development strategies may not exist for some non-traditional approaches. Adjunctive therapies require an active antibacterial drug and thus may not solve the current resistance problem. A strong focus on narrow-spectrum, pathogen-specific and patientspecific therapies will require highly developed and welldeployed diagnostics. These are not yet in view and may be restricted to specific countries and environments, primarily better-resourced environments.

Owing to numerous discovery challenges, it is not surprising to find the global antibacterial clinical pipeline populated with modifications of existing classes of antibiotics that substantially de-risk programmes. Additionally, the dearth of funding available for clinical development of antibacterial therapies contributes to barriers for progression of preclinical projects to human trials after all the scientific challenges in the preclinical phase have been overcome. A long-term commitment of sustained push funding, pull incentives and new concepts for commercializing and delivering future therapies will be necessary to ensure that current projects will potentially benefit society in the future.",
