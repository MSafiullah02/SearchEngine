            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a viral respiratory disease in chickens caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Cook and Heijden, 2010). Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Cheng et al., 2018; Haji-Abdolvahab et al., 2019). Infectious bronchitis virus genome is unstable and prone to point mutation, deletion, insertion, etc., which leads to continuous isolation of gene mutants. In addition, there are many serotypes of IBV, and the cross-protection between different serotypes or genotypes is very weak (Leghari et al., 2016), which makes the immune control of this disease constantly challenged (Faruku et al., 2015). Therefore, although the disease has been reported for more than 60 yr, its prevention and control is still not good (Cook et al., 2012). The incidence of IBV is high, broilers infected with this virus will grow slowly and feed conversion ratio (FCR) will decline, and if laying hens are infected with IBV, it can lead to the decline of egg production and egg quality, so IB is one of the main infectious diseases detrimental to China's poultry industry.",

The respiratory signs include coughing, sneezing, gasping, and tracheal rales, and there may be gray feces for some diseased chickens (Wu et al., 1998). Necropsy showed catarrhal and hemorrhagic inflammatory lesions of the trachea. Chickens of all ages can be infected with IBV, which is mainly found in respiratory epithelial cells, digestive tract, and other tissues such as kidney, fallopian tube, and testes (Cavanagh, 2007). With clinical symptoms and pathological features similar to those of Newcastle disease (ND), avian influenza (AI), and infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), IB is easy to be misdiagnosed (Giovanni et al., 2017). The current methods for detection of IBV are conventional virus isolation (CVI), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-agarose gel electrophoresis (RT-PCR-AGE), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). However, these methods often require expensive devices and professional operators, making it very inconvenient for veterinarians at the grass roots level in many regions.",

Using this technique, the reverse transcription of RNA and DNA amplification can be completed in a short time at a constant temperature of about 37 to 39\u00b0C. At the same time, the probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and primers were labeled with biotin in the experiment to form double-labeled amplification product that could be visually observed and determined by lateral flow dipstick (LFD) with FAM antibody test line and biotin antibody control line. This method with high specificity and sensitivity was easy and convenient to use, and thus had broad application prospects in clinical diagnosis (Kim and Easley, 2011).",

Conventional virus isolation (CVI) is the most classical and reliable method for the diagnosis of IB, but it has the disadvantages of long period and high technical requirements. Serological diagnosis is also a common technique in the actual detection of IB, but most of the commercial IBV antibody kits are coated with whole virions, having a strong cross-reaction with local strains of different serotypes, as a result, the application of commercial IBV antibody detection kit is limited (Lin et al., 1991). Conventional PCR and RFQ-PCR are sensitive and specific in nucleic acid diagnosis, but they still have the shortcomings of long period, carcinogen EB pollution and need for expensive instruments (Zhang et al., 2018). Reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification is a rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable technique for isothermal gene amplification (Daher et al., 2016). The whole reaction is simple, rapid, and does not require high temperature cycling, so it is particularly suitable for use in non-laboratory testing sites with a large number of samples (Piepenburg et al., 2006).",

A single-base gap at a position 30 bp from the 5' end was modified with tetrahydrofuran residue, the 3' end was blocked by phosphorylation, and a compatible probe was helpful to improve the specificity of RT-RAA reaction. Notably, the RT-RAA kit completed reverse transcription and DNA amplification in 1 step, saving detection time and reagents. Finally, the double-labeled products amplified by RT-RAA could be detected directly by LFD and visually observed.
