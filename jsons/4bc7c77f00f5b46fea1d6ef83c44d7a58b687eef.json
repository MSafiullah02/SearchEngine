            "text": "The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised important questions on the origins of this virus, the mechanisms of any zoonotic transfer from exotic animals to humans, whether companion animals or those used for commercial purposes can act as reservoirs for infection, and the reasons for the large variations in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities across animal species. Traditional lab-based methods will ultimately answer many of these questions but take considerable time. Increasingly powerful in silico modeling methods provide the opportunity to rapidly generate information on newly emerged pathogens to aid countermeasure development and also to predict potential future behaviors. We used an in silico structural homology modeling approach to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which predicted its high affinity binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Next we sought to gain insights into the possible origins and transmission path by which SARS-CoV-2 might have crossed to humans by constructing models of the ACE2 receptors of relevant species, and then calculating the binding energy of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to each of these. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ACE2, greater than all the other tested species including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly adapted human pathogen. Of the species studied, the next highest binding affinity after human was pangolin, which is most likely explained by a process of convergent evolution. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 for dog and cat ACE2 was similar to affinity for bat ACE2, all being lower than for human ACE2, and is consistent with only occasional observations of infections of these domestic animals. Snake ACE2 had low affinity for spike protein, making it highly improbable that snakes acted as an intermediate vector. Overall, the data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising important questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins might lie elsewhere.",

However, the SARS-CoV-2 structures and sequences that we employed were from viruses collected very early in the pandemic. It is therefore not clear how SARS-CoV-2",

This marries with the fact that Pangolin-CoV shares a highly similar RBD to SARS-CoV-2, although their remaining sequence has only 90% similarity. This could be consistent with a process of convergent evolution whereby human and pangolin coronaviruses infecting via ACE2, have come to the same solution in respect of evolving an optimal spike RBD for binding of either human or pangolin ACE2, respectively. Our data does indicate that humans might be permissive to pangolin CoVs that use ACE2 for cell entry, a fact that needs to be borne in mind in respect of future potential coronavirus pandemic sources. However, this does not mean that pangolin ACE2 was the receptor on which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD was initially selected, with the strength of binding to pangolin ACE2 lower than binding to human ACE2. This makes it unlikely that pangolins are the missing intermediate host. If SARS-CoV-2 spike was selected on pangolin ACE2, then given the higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 than for bat ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 would have to have circulated in pangolins for a long period of time for this evolution and selection to occur and to date there is no evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 like virus circulating in pangolins.",

Such recombination events are known to occur with other RNA viruses and can explain creation of some pandemic influenza strains 49 . Nevertheless, such events are by necessity rare as they require coinfection of the one host at exactly the same time. Most importantly, if such a recombination event had occurred in pangolins it might have been expected to have similarly triggered an epidemic spread of the new highly permissive SARS-CoV-2 like virus among pangolin populations, such as we now see occurring across the human population. Currently there is no evidence of such a pangolin SARS-CoV-2 like outbreak, making this whole scenario less likely.",

The low affinity binding of SARS spike protein for mouse ACE2 has been postulated as the reason mice are largely non-permissive to SARS infection. Similarly, we postulated that variation in ACE2 between species may determine the affinity of binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and hence determine which species are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sequence alignment of the selected ACE2 species is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and the phylogenetic tree showing relatedness of ACE2 proteins across selected animal species is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 2.

            "text": ". The fact that SARS-CoV-2 has also not been found in any likely intermediate host raises questions of the origins of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that infected human case zero in late 2019. Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, hosts China's only BSL4 facility and is the site of considerable bat coronavirus research. Identification of an intermediate animal host in which SARS-CoV-2 might have adapted to a human ACE2 permissive form would go a long way to alleviating concerns that SARS-CoV-2 is not a natural virus. Lam et al. 44 made confused public claims of finding SARS-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins, suggesting that pangolins were an intermediate vector for SARS-CoV-2. However, further sequence analysis of these claims by Zhang et al. established that Pangolin-CoV was a very differentcoronavirus that had modest at best ~90% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2. While Pangolin-CoV spike RBD shared some similarities to SARS-CoV-2, its spike protein did not share the furin cleavage site that was a prominent feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.51 Hence, any similarity of Pangolin-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 was restricted to the residues in the RBD and RBM. Overall, Pangolin-CoV is only a distant relative of SARS-CoV-2.Based on our data, the similarity of Pangolin-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike RBM could be a case of convergent evolution of the two viruses, whereby the close similarity of the structure of the pangolin ACE2 spike binding domain (SBD) to the same region of human ACE2, drove the convergent evolution of the spike protein RBD of both viruses, allowing them to bind to pangolin and human ACE2, respectively. Such close similarity of pangolin and human ACE2 SBD could make it easy for any pangolin CoV to cross from pangolins to humans. Nevertheless, with no virus matching the SARS-CoV-2 sequence identified in pangolins this makes it less likely that SARS-CoV-2 has a pangolin origin. However, this does call for more intensive survey of coronaviruses in pangolin populations, should such viruses pose future human pandemic threats. This finding also supports the need for strict enforcement of a worldwide ban on any trafficking of pangolins to reduce risks of pangolin coronaviruses crossing to humans and becoming a trigger for a future",

Similarity of the template and query is important while building the model, the query sequence of Macaca fascicularis (monkey) accession number A0A2K5X283 was found to be 96.9% similar to the structure of human ACE2 (PDB id: 1R42) whereas Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) had a much lower similarity of 61.42% to its template, 1R42 (Table 2).

Directly testing broad ranges of species for virus susceptibility is difficult and time consuming and in the cases of very rare species, may not even be practicable. A less direct method to try and obtain the same information might involve measurement of binding affinity of the SARScells expressing human ACE2. This finding is particularly surprising as, typically, a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.The calculated binding energies of SAR-Cov2 spike protein with ACE2 from selected species are in general agreement with the relatively limited amount of published information. SAR-Cov2 binding affinity to monkey ACE2 was lower than for human ACE2.

In the case of companion animals that live in close proximity to humans, Shen at al. state that SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently transmittedin cats and dogs while Shi et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but that ferrets and cats were permissive to infection. Temmam et al. tested 9 cats and 12 dogs living in close contact with their owners, two of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 11 of 18 others showed clinical signs of COVID-19 but no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood using an immunoprecipitation assay. Goumeniu et al. published an editorial querying the role of dogs in the Lombardy COVID-19 outbreak and recommended use of computational docking experiments to provide evidence for or against infection of dogs.43 Hence, our model data suggesting that dog ACE2 might be permissive for SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection is therefore consistent with anecdotal reports of dogs being infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
