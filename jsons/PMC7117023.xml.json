            "text": "More than a century after the discovery of the ABO blood group (BG) by Karl Landsteiner [1], currently, over 30 different BG systems and more than 300 recognized BG antigens are defined by the International Society for Blood Transfusion (ISBT) [2]. A recent overview is provided on the society's website [3]. The different BG antigens evolve from genetic polymorphisms of red blood cell (RBC) surface molecules, most of which are peptides, and some are carbohydrates, such as ABO antigens [3]. However, BG antigens including ABO are not only expressed on RBCs, but are also present in many tissues [4]. Therefore, these histo-BG antigens appear to be relevant not only in transfusion medicine, but also in transplantation [5]. Moreover, histo-BG antigens may also occur in glandular secretions. For example, ABO and Lewis antigens are found on saliva mucins, and free oligosaccharides are found in milk and urine [6], [7], [8], [9]. Structurally, these particular histo-BGs are glycans, defined as \u201cany sugar or assembly of sugars, in free form or attached to another molecule\u201d [10].",

Largest body of evidence for the carbohydrate-based histo-BGs ABO, Lewis (Le) and secretor (Se) is available particularly in the context of infectious diseases and cancer (reviewed in [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). Nevertheless, histo-BG glycans are far from being exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic applications, apart from the prominent exception of the cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, i.e. sialyl-Lea\n[17].",

            "text": "The biosynthesis of the antigens from ABO and Le histo-BGs is closely related, although the responsible glycosyltransferases are expressed from several independent genes: ABO gene on chromosome 9, H-gene (FUT1), Se-gene (FUT2), and Le-gene (FUT3) on chromosome 19 [34], [37]. For abbreviated as well as full names including linkage specificities and responsible genes of the fucosyltransferases (FUT), see Table 1. Starting from type 1 lactosamine residues, Le-FUT and Se-FUT are competing to generate an Lea or type 1H epitope (Led), respectively [46], [47] (Fig. 2A). Type 1H (or Se antigen) is a substrate for the ABO gene-encoded A or B transferase, producing the A or B antigen, if one of the active alleles is present. Furthermore, type 1H can be fucosylated by Le-FUT, generating the Leb epitope. Lea and Leb structures cannot be further modified, whereas A and B antigens are again substrates to Le-FUT, resulting in ALeb and BLeb antigens [6], [28], [48], [49]. This pathway takes place in secretory tissues and cells other than erythrocytes, since type 1 structures are highly expressed in outer epithelial layers with higher degree of differentiation, e.g. in the oral or gut mucosa, and are substrates to Se-FUT [4]. Se-FUT is active in about 80% of Caucasians, the so-called secretors (Table 1). If the Le gene is inactive, only the precursor structures Lec (type 1 precursor) and Led (type 1H), that are classified as part of the BG collection 210 [3], are found in plasma or on red blood cells of non-secretors and secretors, respectively [28]. Erythrocytes normally have no Se-FUT or Le-FUT expression [50], and bear ABO antigens mainly on type 2 chains, which are the preferred substrates for H-FUT [4].",

In addition to Se-FUT, if expressed in the respective cell type, the H gene-regulated H-FUT will primarily synthesize type 2H structures, which can be further modified by A or B transferases or alpha1,3-FUTs, incl. Le-FUT3. The action of this type of FUTs results in Ley epitopes, i.e. type 2 isomers of Leb. In analogy to the above-described pathway for type 1 chains, in type 2 ALey and BLey will be the largest end products if all the respective glycosyltransferases are expressed in their active form [6], [28].

The classification of these antigens has been changed several times in the past; the current state according to the ISBT is listed in Table 1. Structurally, GSLs are composed of a lipophilic part containing a long chain fatty acid and a sphingosine anchored in the plasma membrane, and a hydrophilic glycan head group (Fig. 1). Starting from lactosylceramide either Pk antigen (globotriaosylceramide, CD77) is synthesized via the action of the A4GALT gene-encoded galactosyltransferase leading to the globo-series GSL pathway, or P1 antigen is synthesized via the action of the same enzyme following two other (non-BG-related) glycosyltransferases generating neolacto-series GSL (Fig. 3). For P antigen production an active B3GALNT1-gene is required. The structures of the globo- and (neo)lacto-series GSLs act as precursors for GSL-attached ABO, Le and H/Se epitopes, as indicated in Fig. 3. If a null-allele of either A4GALT or B3GALNT1 is apparent (in very rare cases), globo-GSLs cannot be produced [52]. Furthermore, a rare variant of the A4GALT enzyme is linked to the expression of NOR antigens [53]. The FORS1 antigen was found in individuals with an activated GBGT gene, which is normally not active in humans, but in some non-primate animals [27]. Except for P1 antigen, which is RBC-specific, the expression of the other related antigens is common to many tissues and cell types, and expression levels can vary during cell cycle and differentiation [12].",

Moreover, in pregnant women, individuals with different hematologic disorders, and especially in newborns, weak expression of histo-BG antigens on RBCs has been reported [57], [58]. The age-dependency of ABO antigen expression on RBCs is connected to the expression of I antigen, which is the major precursor of ABO structures on RBCs [12]. I antigen expression in RBCs is negligible at birth and reaches the full adult level by the age of 18 months [59], giving an example of the oncodevelopmental nature of histo-BG antigen expression [33]. The expression levels of ABO/Se and Le antigens can also vary tremendously within an adult individual over time [60]. Regulatory mechanisms of histo-BG-related glycogene expression, such as microRNA or transcription factor expression, are now being studied [38], [61].",

These combined histo-BG antigens are recognized for their role in the context of cancer as is discussed below. Interestingly, sialyltransferases also compete with FUTs for the same substrates, and can therefore have an impact on the expression levels of the inter-connected ABO and Le glycan BG antigens [12]. The different levels of substrate specificities have an additional impact on the overall complexity of the biosynthetic network of histo-BG glycosyltransferases: Some antigens can be synthesized by more than one enzyme (see H/Se) and in some instances enzymes are not limited to only one type of acceptors (see chain types 1\u20134 for Se-FUT or the various substrates of Le-FUT), or one type of linkage (s. Le-FUT acting as alpha1,3 and alpha1,4-FUT).",

Since glycans are known for their predominant role as recognition molecules, in particular, in infection, the association of glycan histo-BG polymorphisms with various infectious diseases is not surprising. Many vertebrate species have maintained a functional AB gene, however, in humans roughly half of the population has O genotype resulting in a non-functional A/B enzyme. ABO polymorphism has been linked to evolutionary adaptation as defense against inter- and intra-species infections, since individuals produce antibodies against the non-self AB antigens after the exposure to these antigens originating from e.g. pathogens [62]. Masking of pathogen adhesion glycotopes by other glycans is another defense mechanism suggested [63]. Whereas microbial attachment sites on epithelial surfaces can support colonization, histo-BG antigens on soluble glycans such as mucins or free oligosaccharides from human milk may serve as decoy receptors in pathogen defense [64], [65], [66] (Fig. 1).",

Remarkably, H. pylori is able to bind to the same antigenic structures on the host's epithelial surface [91]. H. pylori is present in half of the world population and chronic infection is linked to gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer with a high degree of heterogeneity in disease phenotypes [92]. The bacterium is able to attach only to Leb antigen without additional A or B epitopes, and has therefore been proposed to be linked to BG O [91]. However, clinical data on the association of H. pylori, gastric cancer and ABO/Le BGs are contradictory (Table 2). A higher incidence of H. pylori in O and a lower incidence in A-individuals have been reported in multiple studies [63]. Strikingly, gastric cancer risk was higher in A BG (incidence rate ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.42), whereas peptic ulcer risk was found to be higher in O-individuals in a large population-based study [68]. The link to Le and Se phenotype seems to be even more unclear. For instance, Se status and H. pylori infection have shown to be independent risk factors for gastric disease, with a higher risk in non-Se [81], although Leb (Se) seems to play a crucial role in H. pylori adhesion [12], [91]. On tissue level, H. pylori infected patients with gastric ulcer were shown to have increased Lea and loss of H and Leb expression in their inflamed gastric mucosa [7]. The authors claimed ABO and Le antigens to be good indicators for cellular alterations in the gastric epithelium.",

B and AB individuals in a pediatric cohort were found to be more susceptible to salmonellosis and various E. coli types of infections (meningitis, sepsis, pyelonephritis) as compared to A or O individuals [71]. In contrast, Shigella infections were more prevalent in O individuals [71]. This relates to the higher susceptibility of O-individuals to infection by another Shiga-toxin related bacterial strain, i.e. E. coli O157 [67]. The same study found P-negative individuals to be more likely to develop severe hemolytic uremic syndrome after infection, possibly due to higher induction of TNF-alpha [67]. Pk, LKE and FORS1 histo-BG antigens have been associated with other Shiga toxin- and verotoxin-producing E. coli strains (STEC and EHEC) [24], [95]. Moreover, Pk-knockout mice showed no reaction to verotoxin administration, whereas basal levels of Pk expression were already lethal to wild-type mice [52].",

Therefore, exploring the role of anti-BG antibody response and protection following specific vaccinations is of great interest, as has been shown in a systems biology approach using glycan microarray analysis of immunoglobulin G preparations from different healthy populations [108]. The pooled antibody preparations bound to various self-antigen ligands including especially GLOB, FORS1, Ley, BG A1 and BG B epitopes, but also H2 and sialyl-Lea in some cases. The authors suggested a protective role for these self-antibodies by blocking bacterial attachment sites if released on epithelial surfaces.",

In addition, a certain rotavirus genotype, P[11] that mainly infects neonates, was found to attach specifically to saliva from neonates and infants, but not adults, due to high expression of polylactosamines, i.e. the i antigen [109]. Different viral proteins from selected rotaviral genotypes were found to bind to either i epitopes or their type 1 isomers with or without internal Lex of human milk oligosaccharides in a strain- and viral protein-dependent manner [64]. Consequently, infectivity seems to be highly dependent on the virus genotype in interaction with the host ancestry/ethnicity and different histo-BGs. For norovirus, multivalent virus-like particle vaccines have therefore been proposed representing a broad set of viral genotypes and strains [110]. Interestingly, anti-histo-BG, but not immunoglobulin G or total antibody titers prior to the challenge with norovirus were positively correlated with protection against infection in placebo-recipients, while in vaccinees the frequency of severe disease was lower with higher pre-challenge anti-histo-BG antibody titers [111]. For the development of efficient vaccines against norovirus and rotavirus, individualized approaches addressing all the relevant factors such as virus genotype, the specific particles and adjuvants used in the vaccine, and their interaction with the histo-BG antigens and anti-histo-BG antibodies of the recipients will be of particular interest in the future.",

Accordingly, sialyl-Tn is a recognized tumor marker and has been proposed as a target for the design of anticancer vaccines [122], however, with limited success to date [123]. Sialyl-Lea/x appear to play a role in later tumor stages and especially in metastasis [15]. Notably, FUT3 (Le) and alpha2,3-sialyltransferase transcription and sialyl-Lea/x antigen expression was shown to be upregulated in H. pylori infected patients with early onset gastric carcinoma [124]. Moreover, sialyl-Lea (CA19-9) is elevated in various types of gastrointestinal carcinomas and is an approved prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer therapy, however, in Le-positive patients only. Since Le-negative individuals do not express an active alpha1,4-FUT, sialyl-Lea/CA19-9 serum levels are significantly lower or even non-detectable in pancreatic cancer patients with null-allelic Le-gene [17].",

This switch has furthermore been linked to enhanced cellular motility and poor prognosis [117]. The A/B expression loss goes along with a higher abundance of the precursor structure I antigen in carcinomas from secretors, whereas cancerous tissue from non-secretors experiences a lower I antigen expression [121]. Moreover, an increased distribution of H antigen throughout all the layers of malignant tissue as compared to a more restricted pattern in normal mucosa has been found [126], [128]. Analogously, alpha1,2-FUT activity from both Se- and H-gene encoded enzymes were higher in rectal carcinomas than in normal tissue [129]. Interestingly, Se/H-antigens were found in cecal tumors from Se- as well as non-Se patients, while being absent in normal tissues of non-secretors. A very recent investigation of cyst fluid and tissue from ovarian tumors has shown remarkable differences in ABO BG antigen expression between different tumor stages and subtypes [130]. By using mass spectrometry average compositions of fucosylation (ABO and Le antigens) and sialylation of mucin-type glycans, the authors were able to distinguish three groups of samples: i) low-grade, low malignant potential carcinomas and benign mucinous, ii) all serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas, and iii) serous benign samples. Again, non-secretor samples were exceptions due to a genetically determined lower expression of BG epitopes on epithelia.",

Moreover, ABO BG was demonstrated as a possible parameter for detecting responders to a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine [132]. Compared to BG A/AB participants, BG O and B patients experienced enhanced survival after vaccination, especially if they developed an antibody response against the FORS1 antigen. This was explained by the authors by the presence of FORS1 in the poxviral vector used for the vaccine, showing structural similarity to the A-antigen. If verified, the conclusions drawn from this and similar studies could open an invaluable opportunity for an effective immunization strategy in a blood-group specific manner by designing vaccines with BG epitopes complementary to the BG of the recipients who would thereby develop an enhanced immune response.",

In addition, childhood asthma was found to have a higher incidence in secretors with BG O and/or Le-negative phenotype [77]. A possible explanation for the higher susceptibility to Crohn's disease in non-secretors is the link via gut microbiota. Intestinal microbiome composition differs between healthy Se and non-Se individuals as well as between different ABO phenotypes among secretors [133], [134]. Moreover, perturbations in gut microbiota metabolism and other factors of the host-microbial environment in non-secretors and FUT2 heterozygous individuals with Crohn's disease have been reported [135]. Fucosylation in the gut, which is primarily mediated by FUT2 and can be induced by certain gut bacteria via yet unknown mechanisms, has a central role in the host-microbe symbiosys and can suppress pathogens [136]. Interestingly, host fucose utilization by specific microbes is only down-regulated in non-Se mice if fed a glucose-rich, polysaccharide-deficient diet, demonstrating an intense interaction between host genetics, diet and gut microbiome [137]. Notably, gastrointestinal malignancies, in particular colorectal cancer, have also been linked to gut microbiota composition [138].",

Moreover, the ABO locus was associated with diabetes type 2 and E-selectin levels, besides sICAM-1 levels [140]. In addition, a lower risk of cardiovascular and associated diseases has been found for BG O individuals and linked to BG antigens on platelet glycoconjugates, as recently reviewed [74]. Interestingly, BG O individuals have lower levels of the blood clotting factors von Willebrand and FVIII due to their shorter plasma half-life [141].",

As briefly demonstrated by the example of the interaction of an individual's Se status and gut microbiota, histo-BGs might play a significant role already at the early stage of disease prevention. Another example is the various histo-BG glycans in human milk, which are suggested to provide double protection to the breastfed child via their prebiotic and their antimicrobial activity in the gut [145]. The decoy function of milk glycans, in particular the highly abundant free oligosaccharides and mucin glycans, offers a yet underexamined possibility for a novel preventive and therapeutic antibiotic strategy. Emerging high-throughput analytical technologies such as glycan microarrays, multiplexed capillary electrophoresis, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) will pave the way for the discovery of such novel bioactive compounds [64], [65], [146], [147].",

An immunoassay is also used for the determination of CA19-9 (sialyl-Lea) levels in clinics [17]. Genotyping, glycosyltransferase transcript analysis as well as standard proteomic techniques are currently being increasingly used also in the context of BG-typing [27], [130], and do therefore comply with the requirements of modern personalized medicine. Furthermore, they might be useful for patient stratification in settings where the genetic histo-BG background in combination with the natural anti-BG antigen antibodies plays a role, such as vaccine efficacy studies. The reverse ABO-typing method developed by Muthana and colleagues by using only 4 \u03bcL of serum with glycan arrays was proven as particularly useful since it enabled retrospective BG typing without having whole blood samples available [132].",

However, the knowledge of a patient's RBC pheno \u2212/genotype or glycosyltransferase expression is only indicative for the final, complex glycomic profile [62], especially if taking into account the vast tissue- and disease-specific variations of the histo-BG antigens, their precursors and conjugates, as well as interactions between different BGs, as discussed in 2, 4.

Therefore, glycomic, together with glycoproteomic and glycolipidomic technologies should be further refined to allow unambiguous (isomer-specific) structural characterization and optimally quantitation of histo-BG glycans that have high potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in the context of both infectious and non-communicable diseases. Currently applied glyco-analytical techniques in the field of biomarker discovery from cancer tissues are presented in Ref. [150]. Major progress in glycomic approaches distinguishing linkages and/or different monosaccharide species has been made recently in the field of N- and O-glycomics [151], [152]. However, glycomics of histo-BGs has been neglected in the last years except for some few, rather targeted approaches [153], [154], [155]. In a very recent study traditional, targeted techniques in combination with liquid-chromatography-MS/MS were successfully applied showing great potential of mucin-type histo-BG glycans for ovarian tumor staging and classification not only from tissues, but also from cystic fluid [130]. Glycomic approaches on only minute amounts of preferably non-invasively acquired patient samples, such as saliva, tears, milk, urine, or feces [66], [156], [157], [158], [159], will be of particular use in the context of early diagnosis and population-wide screening.",

The authors claimed having found a novel function of ABH antigens, i.e. as indirect stabilizers of other glycan-protein interactions. Further research is warranted to reveal the function relevance of such multi-compound complexes involving the concerted binding of glycans in a multivalent manner.",
