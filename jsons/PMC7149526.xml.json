            "text": "In a New England Journal of Medicine article, \u201cIntegrating Social Media into Emergency-Preparedness Efforts,\u201d the reason given by the three authors to the pervasiveness of social media is \u201cit makes sense to explicitly consider the best way of leveraging these communication channels before, during, and after disasters\u2026. Engaging with and using emerging social media may well place the emergency-management community, including medical and public health professionals, in a better position to respond to disasters\u201d (Merchant et al., 2011). Specifically, they suggest: \u25cfActively using networking sites such as Facebook to help individuals, communities, and agencies share emergency plans and establish emergency networks. Web-based \u201cbuddy\u201d systems, for example, might have allowed more at-risk people to receive medical attention and social services during the 1995 Chicago heat wave, when hundreds of people died of heat-related illness.\u25cfLinking the public with day-to-day, real-time information about how their community\u2019s health care system is functioning. For example, emergency room and clinic waiting times are already available in some areas of the country through mobile-phone applications, billboard Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, or hospital tweets. Monitoring this important information through the same social channels during an actual disaster may help responders verify whether facilities are overloaded and determine which ones can offer needed medical care.\n\u25cfUsing location-based service applications (such as Foursquare and Loopt) and global positioning system (GPS) software to allow people to \u201ccheck in\u201d to a specific location and share information about their immediate surroundings. With an additional click, perhaps off-duty nurses or paramedics who check in at a venue could also broadcast their professional background and willingness to help in the event of a nearby emergency.\u25cfIncreasing the use of social media during recovery. The extensive reach of social networks allows people who are recovering from disasters to rapidly connect with needed resources. Tweets and photographs linked to timelines and interactive maps can tell a cohesive story about a recovering community\u2019s capabilities and vulnerabilities in real-time. \u201cOrganizations such as Ushahidi have helped with recovery in Haiti by matching volunteer health care providers with distressed areas. Social media have been used in new ways to connect responders and people directly affected by such disasters as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, flash floods in Australia, and the earthquake in New Zealand with medical and mental health services\u201d (Merchant et al., 2011).\n",

Action helps reduce anxiety and restores a sense of control, even if it is symbolic, put up the flag, or preparatory\u2014donate blood, or just as simple, check on an elderly neighbor.\u25cf\nUncertainty\u2014People dislike uncertainty.

            "text": "The CDC has found that people may receive, interpret, and act on information differently during an emergency than during a normal period. Four factors that change how we process information during a crisis: 1.\nWe simplify messages\u2014Under intense stress and possible information overload, we tend to miss the nuances or importance of health and safety messages by: \u25cfNot fully hearing information, because of our inability to juggle multiple facts during a crisis.\u25cfNot remembering as much of the information as we should.\u25cfConfusing action messages, such as remembering which highway is blocked for safetyTo cope, many of us may not attempt a logical and reasoned approach to decision making. Instead, we may rely on habits and long-held practices. We might also follow bad examples set by others, and engage in irrational behaviors like unfairly blaming leaders or institutions.\n2.\nWe hold on to current beliefs\u2014Disaster communication sometimes requires asking people to do something that seems counterintuitive. Examples include the following: \u25cfGetting out of a safe car and lying in a ditch instead of outrunning a tornado.\u25cfEvacuating even when the weather looks calm.Changing our beliefs during a crisis or emergency may be difficult. Beliefs are very strongly held and are not easily altered.\n3.\nWe look for additional information and opinions\u2014We remember what we see, and tend to believe what we\u2019ve experienced. During crises, we want messages confirmed before taking action. You may find that you or other individuals are likely to do the following:\n\u25cfChange television channels to see if the same warning is being repeated elsewhere.\u25cfTry to call friends and family to see if others have heard the same messages.\u25cfCheck in on their social media networks to see what their friends and family are doing.\u25cfTurn to a known and credible local leader for advice.\u25cfIn cases where evacuation is recommended, we tend to watch to see if our neighbors are evacuating before we make our decision. This confirmation first\u2014before we take action\u2014is very common in a crisis.\n4.\nWe believe the first message\u2014During a crisis, the speed of a response can be an important factor in reducing harm. In the absence of information, we begin to speculate and fill in the blanks. This often results in rumors. The first message to reach us may be the accepted message, even though more accurate information may follow. When new, perhaps more complete information becomes available, we compare it to the first messages we heard. Therefore, messages should be simple, credible, and consistent. Speed is also very important when communicating in an emergency. An effective message must: \u25cfBe repeated.\u25cfCome from multiple credible sources.\u25cfBe specific to the emergency being experienced.\u25cfOffer a positive course of action that can be executed.People should also have access to more information, through other channels, such as through websites, and old and new media.Good communication can reduce stress, harmful human behavior, and prevent negative public health response outcomes. Trained communicators will do the following:\u25cfReduce high levels of uncertainty.\u25cfUse an effective crisis-communication plan.\u25cfBe the first source for information.\u25cfExpress empathy and show concern.\u25cfExhibit competence and expertise.\u25cfRemain honest and open.\u25cfCoordinate with other response officials.\u25cfCommit and remain dedicated to the response and recovery after the immediate crisis has passed.\n\n",

            "text": "The perception of risk is not about numbers alone and communicators should consider the following rules for raising the public\u2019s comfort level during a crisis. These are adapted from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Seven Cardinal Rules of Risk Communication.\n1.\nAccept and involve the public as a legitimate partner\u2014Two basic tenets of risk communication in a democracy are generally understood and accepted. First, people and communities have a right to participate in decisions that affect their lives, their property, and the things they value. Second, the goal should be to produce an informed public that is involved, interested, reasonable, thoughtful, solution-oriented, and collaborative. You should not try to diffuse public concerns and avoid action. Guidelines: \u25cfShow respect for the public by involving the community early, before important decisions are made.\u25cfClarify that decisions about risks will be based not only on the magnitude of the risk but on factors of concern to the public.\n2.\nListen to the audience\u2014People are often more concerned about issues such as trust, credibility, control, benefits, competence, voluntariness, fairness, empathy, caring, courtesy, and compassion. They are not as interested in mortality statistics, and the details of a quantitative risk assessment. If your audience feels or perceives that they are not being heard, they cannot be expected to listen. Effective risk communication is a two-way activity. Guidelines: \u25cfDo not make assumptions about what people know, think, or want done about risks.\u25cfListen. Monitor social media and comments on your website. Make an active effort to find out what people are thinking and feeling.\u25cfInvolve all parties who have an interest or a stake in the issue.\u25cfIdentify with your audience and try to put yourself in their place.\u25cfRecognize people\u2019s emotions.\u25cfLet people know that you understand their concerns and are addressing them. Understand that audiences often have hidden agendas, symbolic meanings, and broader social, cultural, economic, or political considerations that complicate the task.\n3.\nBe honest, frank, and open\u2014Before a risk communication message can be accepted, the messenger must be perceived as trustworthy and credible. So the first goal must be to establish trust and credibility. Short-term judgments of trust and credibility are based largely on verbal and nonverbal communications. Long-term judgments are based largely on actions and performance. Once made, trust and credibility judgments are resistant to change. In communicating risk information, these are your most precious assets. Once lost, they are difficult to regain. Guidelines: \u25cfExpress willingness to follow up with answers if the question cannot be answered at the time you are speaking.\n\u25cfMake corrections if errors are made.\u25cfDisclose risk information as soon as possible, emphasizing appropriate reservations about reliability.\u25cfDo not minimize or exaggerate the level of risk.\u25cfLean toward sharing more information, not less, to prevent people from thinking something significant is being hidden.\u25cfDiscuss data uncertainties, strengths, and weaknesses, including the ones identified by other credible sources.\u25cfIdentify worst-case estimates and cite ranges of risk estimates when appropriate.\n4.\nCoordinate and collaborate with other credible sources\u2014Allies can be effective in helping communicate risk information. Few things make risk communication more difficult than public conflicts with other credible sources. Guidelines: \u25cfCoordinate all communications among and within organizations.\u25cfDevote effort and resources to the slow, hard work of building bridges, partnerships, and alliances with other organizations.\u25cfUse credible and authoritative intermediaries.\u25cfConsult with others to determine who is best able to answer questions about risk.\u25cfTry to release communications jointly with other trustworthy sources, such as: -University scientists.-Physicians.-Local or national opinion leaders.-Citizen advisory groups.-Local officials.\n\n5.\nMeet the needs of the media\u2014The media are primary transmitters of risk information. They play a critical role in setting agendas and in determining outcomes. The media generally have an agenda that emphasizes the more sensational aspects of a crisis. They may be interested in political implications of a risk. The media tend to simplify stories rather than reflect the complexity. Guidelines: \u25cfRemain open with, and accessible to, reporters.\u25cfRespect their need to \u201cfeed the beast\u201d\u2014to provide news for an audience that is eager for information 24/7.\u25cfProvide information tailored to the needs of each type of media, such as sound bites, graphics, and other visual aids for television.\u25cfAgree with the reporter in advance about specific topics and stick to those during the interview.\u25cfPrepare a limited number of positive key messages in advance and repeat the messages several times during the interview.\u25cfProvide background material on complex risk issues.\u25cfDo not speculate.\n\u25cfSay only those things that you are willing to have repeated. Everything you say in an interview is on record.\u25cfKeep interviews short and follow up on stories with praise or criticism, as warranted.\u25cfEstablish long-term trust relationships with specific editors and reporters.\n6.\nSpeak clearly and with compassion\u2014Technical language and jargon are barriers to successful communication with the public. In low-trust, high-concern situations, empathy and caring carry more weight than numbers and technical facts. Guidelines: \u25cfUse plain language.\u25cfRemain sensitive to local norms, such as speech and dress.\u25cfStrive for brevity, but respect people\u2019s needs and offer to provide more information if needed.\u25cfUse graphics and other pictorial material to clarify messages.\u25cfPersonalize risk data by using anecdotes that make technical data come alive.\u25cfAcknowledge and respond to emotions that people express, such as anxiety, fear, anger, outrage, and helplessness.\u25cfPromise only what can be delivered.\u25cfUnderstand and convey that any illness, injury, or death is a tragedy.\u25cfAvoid distant, abstract, unfeeling language about deaths, injuries, and illnesses.\u25cfDo not discuss money\u2014the magnitude of the problem should be in the context of the health and safety of the people\u2014loss of property is secondary.\n7.\nGive people things to do\u2014In an emergency, simple tasks will: \u25cfGive people a sense of control.\u25cfKeep people motivated to stay tuned to what is happening.\u25cfPrepare people to take action if and when they need to do so.\n8.\nDo no harm\u2014The odds of a negative public response increases when poor communication practices are added to a crisis situation. Potentially harmful practices to avoid include the following: \u25cfInaccuracy.\u25cfMixed and conflicting messages from multiple sources.\u25cfLate release of critical information.\u25cfFailure to address or correct rumors.\u25cfOverly reassuring and unrealistic communication.\u25cfA lack of empathy.\u25cfPublic power struggles, conflicts, and confusion.\u25cfPerception that certain groups are getting preferential treatment.(CDC, 2012)\n\n",
