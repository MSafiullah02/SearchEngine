            "text": "Records were searched at three referral centres in Sydney, NSW from January 1995 to December 2002 for cats that had CSF analysis. CSF collection was performed in 111 cats. Of these, 62 cats could be classified as having inflammatory CNS disease. CSF was collected by percutaneous puncture from either the cerebello-medullary cistern or via lumbar puncture from either the L5\u2013L6 or L4\u2013L5 intervertebral space. CSF analysis included total white cell count and red cell count by haemocytometer, cytomorphology by stained sediment (Idexx Laboratories Pty Ltd) or stained cytocentrifuge smears (The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology) and total protein by evaluation of microprotein on a commercial biochemistry autoanalyser (Olympus AU 400, Idexx Laboratories; Cobas Mira, The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology). The reference ranges used by our laboratories for feline CSF were: white cell count \u22645 cells/\u03bcl, red cell count 0 cells/\u03bcl and total protein <0.3 g/l (Raskin and Myer, 2001, Canfield and Martin, 1998). An inflammatory CSF analysis was defined as one in which a total nucleated cell count was greater than 5 cells/\u03bcl or one in which the total nucleated cell count was normal but the nucleated cell differential count was abnormal (>9% neutrophils, >1% eosinophils) (Canfield and Martin, 1998, Raskin and Myer, 2001). CSF nucleated cell counts were classified as: 1, normal: \u22645 cells/\u03bcl; 2, mildly elevated: 6\u201350 cells/\u03bcl; 3, moderately elevated: 51\u20131000 cells/\u03bcl and 4, markedly elevated: >1000 cells/\u03bcl. The nucleated cell population was classified as: 1, suppurative: >50% neutrophils; 2, non-suppurative: >80% mononuclear cells; 3, eosinophilic: >50% eosinophils and 4, mixed: no predominance of any one cell type (Canfield and Martin, 1998, Raskin and Myer, 2001). CSF total protein was classified as 1, normal: \u22640.3 g/l; 2, mildly elevated: 0.31\u201310 g/l; 3, moderately elevated: 11\u201320 g/l and markedly elevated: >20 g/l. CSF erythrocyte counts were classified as: 1, normal: 0 cells/\u03bcl; 2, mildly elevated: 1\u201349 cells/\u03bcl; 3, moderately elevated 50\u20131000 cells/\u03bcl and 4, markedly elevated: >1000 cells/\u03bcl (\nTable 1). The contribution of CSF red cell contamination to the total CSF white cell count was corrected for by subtracting 1 nucleated cell for every 100 red cells (Rand et al 1990). Cats with CSF nucleated cell count that was less than or equal to that predicted from blood contamination were excluded from the study.",

Systemic signs included pyrexia in six cats, lethargy in three cats, ocular abnormalities in six cats and weight loss in four cats. Four cats had an abdominal effusion and one cat a pleural effusion.

The CSF nucleated cell count was markedly elevated (2960 cells/\u03bcl) with a mixed inflammatory pattern and moderate blood contamination (90 cells/\u03bcl). The CSF protein concentration was mildly elevated (4.3 g/l). FIP was the initial clinical diagnosis and prednisolone (Macrolone; Mavab) was prescribed. The cat made a dramatic improvement within 2 days of prednisolone therapy and was gradually weaned off prednisolone over 6 months. Twelve months later the cat was clinically normal. The Russian Blue presented with a chronic history of hindlimb paresis with localisation of signs to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. The nucleated cell count was moderately elevated (623.7 cells/\u03bcl) with moderate blood contamination (53 cells/\u03bcl). The CSF protein concentration was moderately elevated (11.6 g/l). The inflammation was mononuclear. Complete blood count, biochemical profile and spinal radiographs did not reveal any abnormalities. The cat was treated with prednisolone (Macrolone; Mavlab) and gradually improved over the following 6 days. This cat was also gradually weaned off prednisolone over 6 months and was clinically normal 2 years later.",

There was a mildly elevated CSF nucleated cell count (10.1 cells/\u03bcl) that was suppurative. The cat had been fed a diet of sulphur dioxide preserved kangaroo meat exclusively for 8 weeks. Treatment included thiamine (thiamine hydrochloride; Natural Health Products), 20 mg PO q12 h and a diet change to a balanced cat food. The cat showed a dramatic improvement within 24 h of therapy and was clinically normal at long term follow-up 2 years later. The other was a 9-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair that also had with an acute onset of ataxia, depression, nystagmus, postural reaction deficits and weight loss. The CSF leukocyte count was normal (2 cells/\u03bcl) but consisted entirely of non-degenerate neutrophils.

Five cats had a chronic course of disease while one was presented with acute clinical signs. In three cats the clinical signs localised the disease to the spinal cord. Two cats had multifocal disease and one cat focal cerebral disease. All six cats had mononuclear inflammation and in five cats, large atypical lymphoid cells were observed in the CSF. In the sixth cat, lymphoma was diagnosed via fine needle aspirate biopsy of the kidneys. Four cats had mildly elevated CSF leukocyte counts (6\u201350 cells/\u03bcl). The remaining two cats had moderate (218 cells/\u03bcl) and marked (1144 cells/\u03bcl) CNS inflammation. One cat had a normal CSF protein level and four had mild elevations (0.31\u201310 g/l). In one cat the protein was not measured due to insufficient sample. The most common abnormal ancillary tests were non-regenerative anaemia in three and leukocyte abnormalities (varying combinations of eosinophilia, neutrophilia, monocytosis and abnormal peripheral lymphocytes) in three. One cat had abnormal thoracic and abdominal radiographs (sternal lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly), one had an abnormal myelogram (spinal cord compression), one had lymphoma revealed by fine needle aspirate biopsy of the kidneys and one had a computed tomography scan which revealed a mass in the frontal lobe. The cat with hepatomegaly had lymphoma confirmed by transabdominal hepatic fine needle aspirate biopsy. The cat with the abnormal myelogram had lymphoma of the spinal cord confirmed by surgical fine needle aspirate biopsy. Three cats survived less than 1 month, two survived 1\u20136 months and one cat was lost to follow-up. No cat was recorded to have survived more than 3 months after presentation.

Correcting for peripheral blood contamination using the ratio of red cells to white cells in the peripheral blood may not be an accurate indicator of the effects of blood contamination on CSF fluid (Wilson and Stevens 1977). Rand et al (1990) suggested a formula for the correction of CSF white blood cell counts based on the CSF red blood cell number. This study also showed that the formula was likely to overestimate the degree that blood contamination elevated CSF white cell counts in approximately 50% of cases. The maximum expected increase in white cells is calculated based on the assumption that there is one additional white cell/\u03bcl of CSF per 100 red cells/\u03bcl of CSF. In this study, cases were excluded if blood contamination was significant enough to explain the elevated white cell count. Thus, all cats with true CNS inflammation would be included but is possible that some cats with true inflammation were excluded.",

Possible causes include cell lysis, less cells entering the lumbar CSF or migration of white cells from lumbar CSF to blood (Bailey and Higgins 1985). Increased protein concentration in the lumbar CSF may be caused by sluggish spinal CSF circulation resulting in protein accumulation. Similar differences have been observed in feline CSF protein levels (Hochwold et al 1969). Changes in white blood cell counts between lumbar and cisternal punctures have not been compared in cats.

The \u2018gold standard\u2019 for diagnosis is histopathology which reveals a perivascular proliferation of macrophages, lymphocytes plasma cells and neutrophils with a central area of necrosis (Hartmann et al 2003). It has been shown that evaluation of albumin:globulin ratio (<0.5) and anti-coronavirus antibody in body cavity effusions (any titre) had a good positive predictive value for the diagnosis of FIP. In addition, the highest serum anti-coronavirus antibody titre (1:1600) also had a good positive predictive value however, any serum antibody titre less than this was not valuable (Hartmann et al 2003).

In contrast, Rand et al., 1994a, Rand et al., 1994b found that 16% of cases (combined primary inflammatory and non-inflammatory CNS disease) were diagnosed with non-suppurative meningoencephalitis of suspected viral origin. Quesnel et al (1997) found 47% of cats presented for seizure disorders to have non-suppurative meningoencephalitis of possible viral cause. Our study found that only three cats had findings that were supportive of non-FIP viral infection. The diagnosis is suggested by mononuclear meningitis without visceral lesions of FIP and perivascular cuffing as the only histologic lesion (Lundgren 1992). It has been postulated that certain viruses, eg, parvovirus, feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, FIV and FeLV could all cause these histopathological lesions. The arboviruses have received special interest in Canada. There are six strains of arbovirus known to cause encephalitis in humans in Canada (Artsob and Spencer 1979). Some of these are also known to be endemic in the wild animal population and experimental infections in cats (Powassan virus) have caused non-suppurative meningoencephalitis (Keane et al., 1987, Rand et al., 1994a). There are more than 70 strains of arbovirus in Australia, only two of which are known to cause encephalitis in humans (Murray River and Kunjiin virus) (Boughton 1994). The cause of feline non-suppurative meningoencephalitis is not known but the apparent variation in the diagnosis of this condition may reflect differences in causative agent(s) seen in the two geographical locations.",

Cats with FIP had, by far, the highest CSF protein levels (53 and 62 g/l). Hence, markedly elevated protein concentrations should increase the index of suspicion for FIP.

To the author's knowledge, there are no reports in veterinary or human literature on the CSF findings with thiamine deficiency. As CSF collection is a diagnostic test, it is not required if the diagnosis is known. A diagnosis of thiamine deficiency can often be suspected from dietary history and clinical signs. Thiamine deficiency results in cerebrocortical necrosis (Read and Harrington, 1986, Steel, 1997) that could result in a mild suppurative CSF infiltrate.",

Neuroanatomical location provided some indication of the diagnosis in cats with lymphoma, other neoplasia, spinal cord granuloma or trauma (spinal cord). The degree of CSF inflammation, CSF protein concentration and systemic signs provided little contributory information to the final diagnosis other than in cats with FIP. Despite often extensive diagnostic evaluation, 37% of cats was left without a premortem aetiological diagnosis. Future prospective studies with thorough post mortem examination are warranted as post mortem evaluation was only performed in this retrospective study in 18 of the cases. The increased use of advanced imaging (CT/MRI), CSF antibody, molecular biological methods, and CNS biopsy may aid in the diagnosis of CNS disease in the living patient.",
