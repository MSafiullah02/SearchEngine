This kind of teaching model emphasizes on the training of student\u2019s math skills, spatial imagination, logical thinking skills, neglecting the training of their mathematical application ability and mathematical awareness, such as the ability of finding out actual mathematical problem, refining the problem, the use of mathematical language and mathematical model to describe the problem [3], using mathematical tools to solve practical problems. Under this circumstance, the students get no idea of the origin of mathematical concepts and the use of Mathematics. They learn Mathematics just because they have to learn, without any interest and enthusiasm, some of them even fear of it and dislike it. So we integrate the knowledge of Mathematics and the case study of Mathematic Modeling in our Mathematics classes, we also carry the teaching idea as the main point to design Advanced Mathematics Teaching Quality Evaluation System.

So mathematical modeling idea should be permeated in the process of teaching. Student should be instructed that when confronted with practical problems, they should try to find proper model in the lessons which have been taught before and then study the problems with the properties of model or problem-solving thinking. For example, the theory about the nature of continuous function on the closed interval is strong. After introducing theory, the model of the chair stability can be introduced that how to balance a chair on undulating ground. In the process of explaining derivative applications, some practical problems can be introduces such as instantaneous speed, marginal revenue and so on. In some parts of differential equation chapters, epidemic model can be inserted.
