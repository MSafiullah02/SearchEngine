We discuss a less detailed approach which, on the basis of the collected data after few days from the beginning of the new phase, outlines different scenarios of the Covid-19 diffusion for longer time.

In this respect, an important example is the Italian report on the effects of the reopening on the National Health System. The simulation is based on a stochastic epidemic model including the age dependence, the demographic structure, the heterogeneity of social contacts in different meeting places (home, school, work, public transportation, cultural activity, shop, bank, post office) and many work sub-sectors (public health, manufacturing, building, trade, ...)

By the initial data in the new phase one can try to outline the behavior of the spreading for longer time. If the infection regrows exponentially, the (re)lockdown has to be decided as soon as possible. On the other hand, a small change of the specific rate in the Ph2, parameterized by a slight modification of the CC, should require less urgent political choices. The proposed method is discussed in the next Sec. I. In Sec. II the different spreading scenarios in the Ph2 are analyzed. The incubation time of the Covid-19 is evaluated in Sec. III. Sec.
