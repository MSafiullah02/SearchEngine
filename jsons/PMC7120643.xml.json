Trace metals are important in environmental pathology because of the wide range of toxic reactions and their potential adverse effects on the physiological function of organ systems. Exposures to toxic trace metals have been the subject of numerous environmental and geochemical investigations, and many studies have been published on the acute and/or chronic effects of high-level exposures to these types of agents; however, much fewer data are available concerning the health effects of low-dose chronic exposure to many trace metals. Chronic low-dose exposures to toxic elements such as cadmium and arsenic have been shown to cause these metals to accumulate in tissues over time, leading to multiple adverse effects in exposed individuals.",

The toxic effects may affect specific target organ components, resulting in immunological-induced injury or specific functional changes. The diseases caused by metals can be genetic or acquired, and the effects can be acute or chronic. This chapter provides a review of some of these pathologies and discusses the critical organ systems that are affected. Examining such toxicities is a medical challenge in that a number of metallic elements, such as iron, copper, and manganese, are essential to life. Distinguishing normal and pathologic states is critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis of metal-induced diseases. The toxic properties of certain metals, such as lead and mercury, have been acknowledged since ancient times, but enhanced pathologic analyses have allowed us to learn much about how metals can affect specific organ systems. Also reviewed in this chapter are the pathologic states caused by metals in the skin, brain, lung, heart, and liver.",

It is odorless and tasteless and exhibits both acute and chronic health effects in humans. In nature, arsenic can occur as metalloid alloys or in a variety of chemical compounds. In geological media such as rocks, arsenic is commonly found as a sulfide such as orpiment (As2S3) or realgar (As2S2) in the form of arseno\u2013pyrite or mixed sulfides (AsFeS). Significant amounts of arsenic may also be found bound to gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt ores. Mining of these minerals may result in the mobilization and/or transport of arsenic into drinking water. Arsenic has also been used in a variety of agricultural applications (e.g., pesticides, insecticides), industrial applications (e.g., manufacturing of solid-state detectors), and medical applications (e.g., drugs and medical treatments).",

Although arsenic exhibits both organic and inorganic forms, the inorganic trivalent arsenic compounds are considered to demonstrate the greatest toxicity. The molecular basis by which arsenic compounds may induce their toxicity in humans has been described. Impairment of cellular respiration through inhibition of various mitochondrial enzymes and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms by which arsenic exerts its toxic effects. At the molecular level, the toxicity of arsenic results from its ability to interact with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and enzymes and to substitute phosphorus in a variety of biochemical reactions (Li and Rossman 1989). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that arsenic reacts with protein sulfhydryl groups to inactivate enzymes such as dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and thiolase, thereby producing inhibited oxidation of pyruvate and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (Belton et al. 1985).",

The oral route includes contaminated drinking water, food, drugs (including Chinese herbal medications), and tobacco. Inhalation occurs primarily in occupational settings; workers may be exposed to arsenic in the air as a by-product of copper and lead smelting, pesticide production, manufacturing of glass, and production of semiconductors (Chan and Huff 1997). Arsenic tends to concentrate in ectodermal tissues, including the skin, hair, and nails. Biomethylation is considered the major metabolic pathway for inorganic arsenic in humans. Historically, the enzymatic conversion of inorganic arsenic to mono- and dimethylated species has been considered a primary detoxification mechanism of inorganic arsenic; however, compelling experimental evidence obtained from several laboratories suggests that biomethylation, particularly the production of methylated metabolites that contain trivalent arsenic, is a process that can activate arsenic as a toxin and a carcinogen (Styblo et al. 2002; Wei et al. 2002).",

In addition, epidemiological studies have provided suggestive evidence linking arsenic exposure to various internal cancers, including angiosarcoma of the liver, lung cancer, and bladder cancer.

The lesions are usually most pronounced on the palms and soles, although they can occur on the trunk and other areas of the extremities (see Fig. 25.1). Arsenical keratoses are characterized by several specific pathologic features, including hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and acanthosis (see Fig. 25.2). Nuclear atypia is sometimes present as well. In severe atypia, squamous cells exhibit hyperchromatic nuclei and a disorderly arrangement within the epithelium. Within the spectrum of keratotic lesions, arsenical keratosis may be differentiated from the more commonly diagnosed actinic keratosis by the absence of epidermal atrophy and basophilic degeneration of the upper dermis. All arsenical skin changes, including keratoses, tend to occur in non-exposed sites with an absence of dermal solar elastosis noted histologically.\n\n",

The biological mechanisms by which arsenic induces chronic effects including cancer are not well understood and are the subject of considerable research efforts. Arsenic does not directly damage DNA but rather causes chromosome aberrations, aneuploidy, cell transformation, and gene amplification in many cell types. Recently, arsenic-induced carcinogenesis has been studied using molecular biological methods. Among the oncogenes evaluated, the tumor-suppressor gene p53 appears to play a role in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. In one study from an endemic area, 48 cases representing a variety of arsenic-induced skin cancers (including Bowen\u2019s disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma) were examined (Chung et al. 1998). All of the specimens demonstrated positive p53 immunostaining. Positive p53 staining was identified in all perilesional normal skin as well, which suggested that the p53 mutation may be an early event in arsenic-related carcinogenesis. Another study demonstrated that p53 mutation rates, sites, and types in arsenic-related skin cancer are significantly different from those in ultraviolet-induced cancer, which implicates arsenic as the etiologic agent and suggests a possible mechanism of action (Hsu et al. 1999).",

Arsenic and arsenic-containing compounds have also been shown to be potent clastogens both in vivo and in vitro. Arsenical compounds have been reported to induce sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations in both human and rodent cells in culture (Nakamuro and Sayato 1981; Barrett et al. 1989). Arsenical compounds have also been shown to induce gene amplification, arrest cells in mitosis, inhibit DNA repair, and induce expression of the c-fos gene and the oxidative stress protein heme oxygenase in mammalian cells (Ramirez et al. 1997; Jingbo et al. 2002), and they have been implicated as promoters and comutagens for a variety of agents (Cavigelli et al. 1996).",

Mechanisms of AP-1 activation by trivalent arsenic include stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade with a consequent increase in the expression and/or phosphorylation of the two major AP-1 constituents, c-jun and c-fos (Simeonova and Luster 2000).",

The brain must be viewed in a somewhat different light than other organ systems because of its position behind the protective shield of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Because of this critical protective barrier, one must recognize that, for a metal to induce neurologic damage, it must be able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, enter the CNS, and gain access to target cells in sufficient quantity to produce pathologic damage. Compounds in which the metal is linked to a lipophilic organic compound tend to be particularly neurotoxic as they can readily cross the lipid membranes that comprise the blood\u2013brain barrier. One example is mercury, which, in its inorganic form, is relatively nontoxic to the CNS; however, when mercury is methylated to form methylmercury, the compound rapidly crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, is readily taken up by neurons, and produces massive cellular destruction. This results in the severe parenchymal damage that occurred in the outbreak of severe CNS damage in Minamata, Japan (see discussion below). Finally, it should be recognized that the effects of toxins that damage neurons are particularly serious because of the inability of these cells to regenerate.",

One such example is arsenic. As noted earlier, arsenic is generally found as an impurity of ores containing copper, lead, gold, and zinc. Exposure to arsenic is a relatively rare event but does occur due to accidental ingestion, suicide, or murder and most commonly is related to occupational activities and consumption of contaminated drinking water (see 10.1007/978-94-007-4375-5_12, this volume). Arsenic is an active ingredient of herbicides, insecticides, and other pesticides. In cases of acute arsenic poisoning, sudden fatal circulatory collapse may follow ingestion of a single large dose. When smaller doses are involved, gastrointestinal symptoms will predominate initially to be followed after a period of 2\u20133 weeks by the development of a rapidly progressive peripheral neuropathy. The extent and severity of the neurologic symptomatology will depend on the arsenic dosage. In cases of chronic exposure to lower doses of arsenic, a sensory neuropathy is generally observed. Relatively little is known of the mechanism by which arsenic produces its toxic damage, but recent studies suggest that the process involves primary axonal damage.",

In children, however, the effects of relatively low doses can be much more devastating. High doses in children can cause acute lead encephalopathy, a life-threatening condition characterized by generalized cerebral edema with increased intracranial pressure, which leads to transtentorial and cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Clinical features of acute lead encephalopathy may include ataxia, seizures, stupor, coma, and often death. Almost always other associated systemic signs of lead exposure, such as anemia and the presence of lead lines on x-rays of the long bones, are noted in affected children. At autopsy, the brain is markedly swollen with compressed gyri, obliterated sulci, and collapsed lateral ventricles. Uncal and cerebellar tonsillar herniation are commonly encountered. Microscopically, there is a breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier with transudation of fluid into the pericapillary space and ischemic damage to cerebral cortical neurons. Once again, the adult is apparently resistant to such toxic changes, and it is extremely rare to see acute encephalopathy in an adult even following extremely high-exposure doses. More typically, adults exposed to lead develop a peripheral neuropathy with wrist drop and/or ankle drop. Exposure in children leading to encephalopathy is primarily through the eating of peeling paint chips in houses dating from an era when lead-based paints were employed. In general, exposure to lead can come from the air, in the form of lead fumes (e.g., firing range operators, stained glass workers, solderers); from water contaminated by lead plumbing components (particularly in acid conditions); the use of lead-containing vessels (lead crystal, lead glazes of pottery in which acid liquids have been stored); and airborne particulates, such as is found in restorers of old homes and bridge workers.

Documenting low-level, chronic lead exposure has not been easy to accomplish. It is clear that determining a single blood lead level in a child can be completely misleading. In the initial studies of Needleman et al., lead exposure was estimated through the calculation of lead levels in the dentine of deciduous teeth. These studies suggested that exposure to relatively low levels of lead in childhood is associated with a slight, but significant, drop in IQ. Furthermore, such low-level exposures have been associated with a tendency toward disturbed classroom behavior. Follow-up studies on children with elevated lead levels showed a markedly high dropout level from high school, increased absenteeism, and impaired eye\u2013hand coordination. The neuropathologic substrate of all such effects of low-level, chronic lead exposure remains unclear, but these data have resulted in a progressive lowering of what is considered an \u201cacceptable\u201d blood lead level.",

Clinically, exposed patients initially show a constricted visual field, paresthesias, gait ataxia, and impairment of vibration sense (stereognosis) and two-point discrimination. Subsequently, more profound visual loss (frequently progressing to total blindness), ataxia, and sensory\u2013motor signs are noted. The neuropathologic lesions of methylmercury poisoning are quite distinct, with acute necrosis of the calcarine and pre-central cortex and the cerebellum (Shiraki 1979). Nerve cell loss is severe, with a profound glial response. In the cerebellum, the neuronal loss predominates in the internal granular layer, with sparing of the Purkinje cells. Although blindness is a common complication of the disease, the retina appears to be intact, and the loss of vision is thought to be directly related to destruction of the primary visual (calcarine) cortex. In patients with prolonged survival after exposure to methylmercury, dramatic atrophy and glial scarring of the abovementioned regions are observed. Among the most severely affected victims of the Minamata outbreak were newborns who were exposed in utero.

Metallic tin and its inorganic salts have been included in medicinal preparations since the sixteenth century. These were widely administered in relatively high doses without any apparent adverse health effects; however, organic tin compounds, similar to organic mercury compounds, are highly lipid soluble and are also highly toxic to the nervous system (Cavanagh and Nolan 1994). Unfortunately, these characteristics were learned following a serious outbreak of organic tin poisoning in 1954 in France due to the introduction of the drug Stalinon for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. Each Stalinon capsule contained 15 mg of diiodide\u2013diethyltin. Of those exposed to this drug, approximately half died, one-third recovered, and the remainder suffered from a wide variety of chronic neurologic deficits. Autopsies on the acute fatal cases showed evidence of an unusual form of diffuse edema that was confined to the white matter. Subsequent experimental work has shown that triethyltin produces a characteristic and selective white matter edema, presumably through its toxic effects on the functioning of oligodendroglial membranes. Interestingly, animals exposed to trimethyl tin fail to show evidence of white matter edema but instead develop a selective necrosis of neurons of the hippocampus. The mechanism behind this dramatic difference in the selective toxicity of these two extremely similar compounds remains unclear; nevertheless, the organic moiety on each form allows for its rapid uptake into the CNS, thus providing access to the different cellular targets for its toxicity.",

Experimental studies have shown that airborne manganese is readily taken up into the systemic circulation and is selectively deposited in the globus pallidus of the brain, where the major site of damage occurs (Newland et al. 1989; Olanow et al. 1996). Pathological studies of both experimental models and human cases demonstrate evidence of selective neuronal loss and gliosis in globus pallidus (primarily the medial segment) and striatum. Accompanying the neuronal loss is a dramatic increase in the amount of stainable iron within the damaged regions (Olanow et al. 1996). Whether the increased iron participates in the neuronal damage through oxidative damage or is secondary to the parenchymal destruction remains unclear. The substantia nigra pars compacta is the location of the dopaminergic cells that project to the striatum and are the main targets of damage in Parkinson\u2019s disease, but they remain intact in manganese poisoning. Lewy bodies, the characteristic microscopic feature of Parkinson\u2019s disease, are not encountered in cases of manganese-induced parkinsonism. Presumably dysfunction of the extrapyramidal system occurs secondary to damage to the globus pallidus and striatum, the major targets of the striatonigral projections. Because the postsynaptic targets of dopaminergic transmission are largely lost, treatment by levodopa is generally considered to be ineffective in manganese-induced parkinsonism. This represents a major defining characteristic that distinguishes manganese-induced parkinsonism from Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

Excess amounts of both metals have been identified in microprobe studies within the characteristic neurofibrillary tangles of cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Perl and Brody 1980; Good et al. 1992a). Similarly, increased concentrations of iron and aluminum have been noted in the neurons of the substantia nigra in cases of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Good et al. 1992b). It is not considered likely that such elemental accumulations play an etiologic role in these diseases, although they may certainly have the capacity to contribute to their pathogenesis (Perl and Good 1992). Iron, through its ability to donate electrons in energy transfer reactions, may actively support oxidative damage. Evidence for oxidative damage in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease victims is well established (Markesbery 1997). Aluminum is a highly charged element that binds strongly to proteins and acts as a cross-linking stabilizer. Many of the proteins comprising the intraneuronal inclusions that characterize the neurodegenerative diseases (the neurofibrillary tangle being the most prominent example) are highly cross-linked and thus resistant to degradation. Whether aluminum serves this role in the natural history of the disorder remains unclear, although recent evidence appears to support this concept. These findings have raised concerns regarding the source of such elemental accumulations and whether aspects of environmental and geological exposures might play a role in the further onset of these age-related disorders. These questions remain largely unresolved.",

While many forms of pneumoconioses are known today, each with its own etiologic agent, the definition of pneumoconiosis varies. Some authors restrict the term to non-neoplastic reactions of the lung to inhaled minerals or organic dusts, excluding asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Others use the term more broadly to define the accumulation of abnormal amounts of dust and the resulting pathologic reactions (Gibbs 1996). These reactions range from minimal responses to inert dust particles, such as interstitial dust macules, to lethal scarring associated with fibrogenic dusts (see also 10.1007/978-94-007-4375-5_10 and 10.1007/978-94-007-4375-5_19, this volume). Damage caused by inhaled particles depends on a variety of factors, including the number, size, and physiochemical properties of the particles; the deposition, clearance, and retention of particles in the respiratory tract; the host\u2019s inflammatory response to the inhaled particles; and the duration of exposure and interval since initial exposure, as well as interactions with other inhaled particles, particularly cigarette smoke (Roggli and Shelburne 1994).",

Air then passes by way of the bronchi, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, and alveolar ducts to the alveoli. In healthy individuals, the tracheobronchial tree is covered by a thin, watery layer of mucus, which is continuously moved up and out of the lungs by ciliated bronchial epithelium. The velocity of inspired air decreases over the course of the airways. Flow rates decrease slightly in the trachea and are markedly reduced in the third through fifth generations of bronchi.

Deposition of particles occurs in the respiratory tract as a consequence of the physical processes of inertial impaction, sedimentation, and diffusion. Inertial impaction occurs when the air current carrying a particle changes direction and the momentum of the particle carries it along its original path. This frequently results in particle deposition at bifurcation points in the respiratory tract (Brain and Valberg 1979). Sedimentation of particles occurs secondary to the force of gravity, whereas very small particles are deposited by diffusion and Brownian motion. In general, a high percentage of particles greater than 1 \u03bcm in diameter is filtered in the nasopharynx by inertial impaction and sedimentation. A smaller percentage of particles is deposited by the same mechanisms in the trachea and bronchi. When particles are under 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter, they deposit in the alveoli by sedimentation and diffusion (Morgan and Seaton 1975). Breathing rate, tidal volume, and nose versus mouth breathing influence the pattern of deposition (Roggli and Shelburne 1994; Gibbs 1996).",

Mechanisms such as dissolution and absorption, coughing, sneezing, and tracheobronchial and alveolar transport systems keep the lungs relatively free of foreign material (Brain and Valberg 1979). The tracheobronchial system, also known as the mucociliary escalator, extends from the terminal bronchiole to the glottis. Particles deposited in the conducting system adhere to a thin layer of mucus secreted by the mucous glands and goblet cells of the bronchial tree; subsequently, particles are swept toward the glottis by ciliary action and are swallowed or expectorated. The rate of transport is approximately 3 mm per minute, with 80\u201390% of particles removed within 2 h. The bronchial mucus is arranged in two layers: an outer viscous gel, which does not absorb water, and an inner liquid solid phase in which the cilia beat. The function and integrity of the inner layer are affected by dehydration. Ciliary function is influenced by ionic charges, the presence of oxidants, high concentrations of oxygen, low concentrations of adenosine triphosphate, and the presence of oxidants and cigarette smoke. In the alveolar transport system, particles are dissolved, removed to lymphatics, engulfed by macrophages, or transported by surface fluid movement to the mucociliary escalator (Morgan and Seaton 1975). Retention is defined as the amount of particulate matter found in the lungs at any time and is dependent on the rates of deposition and clearance.",

The straight, broad amphibole forms do not readily fragment, whereas the long fibers of chrysotile fragment into short, straight fibers that are cleared (Churg 1998a). Moreover, chrysotile is thought to be chemically unstable and likely to dissolve, whereas amphibole fibers are stable in the environment of the lung (Hume and Roe 1992).

These structures are composed of a clear asbestos core surrounded by a golden yellow coating of iron and mucopolysaccharides. The clear core distinguishes asbestos bodies from other ferruginous bodies. The coat may be continuous or bead-like with terminal bulbs. Fiber dimensions are important factors in determining whether a fiber becomes coated (Roggli 1992). Longer thicker fibers are more likely to become coated than shorter thinner ones (Morgan and Holmes 1985), and fibers less than 20 \u03bcm in length rarely become coated (Morgan and Holmes 1980). Because alveolar macrophages are unable to phagocytize long fibers completely within their cell cytoplasm, they coat the asbestos fibers with an iron\u2013protein matrix (Roggli 1994). For many years, asbestos bodies were thought to be markers of asbestos exposure only in primary asbestos workers. Subsequent studies indicate that asbestos bodies are present in virtually everyone in the general population. Of the asbestos bodies identified in these studies, 98% contained amphibole cores, while the cores in the remaining 2% were chrysotile asbestos (Churg and Warnock 1981); however, asbestos bodies are present in such small numbers from background exposure that an observer should not see an asbestos body in more than 1 in 100 iron-stained, routine-sized paraffin sections (Roggli and Pratt 1983).\n",

As the disease progresses, fibrosis involves the walls of terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts, and ultimately it extends into the adjacent alveolar septae. The minimal histologic criteria for the diagnosis of asbestosis can be defined as the presence of peribronchiolar fibrosis and asbestos bodies, with or without accompanying alveolar fibrosis (Craighead et al. 1982). As peribronchiolar fibrosis occurs with inhalants other than asbestos, it is suggested that, in the absence of alveolar septal fibrosis, the histologic diagnosis of asbestosis be restricted to cases in which the majority of bronchioles are involved (Roggli 1989). The report from the College of American Pathologists suggests that there must be a minimum of two asbestos bodies in areas of fibrosis for the histologic diagnosis of asbestosis (Craighead et al. 1982).",

            "text": "Numerous epidemiologic studies demonstrate an association between asbestos and an excess risk of lung cancer (McDonald 1980). The clinical features\u2014anatomic distribution within the lung and histologic subtypes of asbestos-related lung cancer\u2014are identical to carcinoma in non-exposed individuals. The latency period for asbestos-related lung cancer is lengthy; it peaks at 30\u201335 years (Selikoff et al. 1980). A linear dose\u2013response relationship exists between exposure and the risk of lung cancer at high-exposure levels (McDonald 1980), but at low-exposure levels Browne (1986) suggests that a threshold exists below which the risk of cancer is not increased. This threshold is thought to be in the range of exposure required to produce asbestosis (Churg 1998b). Available data on asbestos workers indicate that the interaction between cigarette smoke and asbestos in increasing the risk of lung cancer is synergistic, or multiplicative, rather than additive (Greenberg and Roggli 1992). Although persons with asbestosis are at excess risk of developing lung cancer (Doll 1993), investigators are uncertain whether this risk is directly related to the asbestos or to the pulmonary fibrosis. Several studies (Sluis-Cremer and Bezuidenhout 1989; Hughes and Weill 1991) demonstrate an increased rate of lung cancer only in the presence of asbestosis, supporting the view that asbestos is carcinogenic because of its fibrogenicity. Churg (1998b) offers the following approach when evaluating cancer in a given case:If asbestosis is present, then the carcinoma is ascribed to asbestos exposure. If the patient smokes or has a history of smoking, then smoking is considered a contributing factor to causation. In the absence of asbestosis, the cancer should not be ascribed to asbestos exposure; the most common causative agent in this instance is cigarette smoke.\n",

The latency period for asbestos-related mesothelioma is long, peaking at 30\u201340 years, and virtually never occurring before 15 years (McDonald and McDonald 1987). Asbestos fiber types differ in ability to produce mesothelioma, with the amphiboles posing greater risk than chrysotile (Browne 1994). Characteristically, mesothelioma grows over the surface of the lung in thick sheets or as nodular masses, which may progress to encase the lung in a hard white rind. Mesotheliomas spread by direct extension into adjacent structures or by lymphatic or hematogenous metastases. Peripheral lung cancers may spread in a similar fashion, which makes the distinction from mesothelioma difficult. Generally, the presence of metastatic disease at clinical presentation favors carcinoma. Mesotheliomas are subclassified by microscopic appearance into epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic patterns. The diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothelioma can be very difficult, and it must be distinguished from benign reactive pleural lesions as well as primary and metastatic neoplasms of the pleura.",

It is believed that mercury ions may act as calcium antagonists at the actin\u2013myosin junction, inhibiting sarcomere contraction, or that they may disrupt microtubule structure.

Plasma, red blood cell, and urine selenium concentrations have been shown to be decreased in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The results of longitudinal studies within populations are conflicting (Huttunen 1997), however, and the risk of decreased levels of selenium appears to correlate with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A nested case-control study among participants in the Physicians\u2019 Health Study showed no effect of selenium on the risk for acute myocardial infarction (Salvini et al. 1995). Other studies using toenail selenium concentration, which is a better measure of chronic selenium levels, have shown an inverse relationship between selenium and myocardial infarction only in Germany, which has relatively low levels of selenium (Kardinaal et al. 1997).",

A large prospective study in a Danish population demonstrated that men with the lowest tertile of blood selenium had a mildly increased risk for developing acute ischemic events of stroke or myocardial infarct (risk ratio of 1.7); this risk remained significant to a low level of probability (p = 0.05) when other risk factors were considered. This study also demonstrated a correlation between selenium and traditional risk factors, including tobacco smoking, social class, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol, hypertension, age, and physical inactivity (Suadicani et al. 1992). Other studies have found that selenium levels are affected by cigarette smoking and alcohol use, and that selenium is a negative acute phase reactant and may therefore be secondarily decreased by the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis. The current consensus is that the effect of selenium on ischemic heart disease is small and likely mediated by an association with other risk factors (Rayman 2000).",

In most of these studies, the association persists after correction for other variables. A similar number of studies have shown no association or only a very weak association between lead and hypertension, after adjustment for age and body mass index, in populations with or without known lead exposure. A study from the United States demonstrated an association only in African-Americans, who had higher lead levels (Sokas et al. 1997). In a study of postpartum women in Los Angeles, an association between lead and hypertension was demonstrated only in immigrants who had, in general, higher levels than nonimmigrants. A study in Germany demonstrated a link only in heavy drinkers of alcohol; results from a cross-sectional analysis of alcoholics in the United States also demonstrate a link between hypertension and blood lead levels.

Studies estimating body stores of lead in measurements of blood and urine after a chelating challenge have also suggested a link between hypertension and increased lead stores, especially in the presence of renal failure (Sanchez-Fructuoso et al. 1996).",

This link between lead and coronary artery disease is corroborated by data showing a direct association between blood lead and electrocardiographic changes of left ventricular hypertrophy. There is evidence that occupational exposure to lead is associated with increased risk of dying from hypertension-related illness. A prospective study in Belgium, however, in which patients were followed for 6 years did not show any association between blood levels and hypertension, a finding that refutes a significant link between coronary heart disease and lead exposure (Staessen et al. 1996). The mechanisms by which lead may induce hypertension include increased vascular responsiveness to catecholamines mediated by effects on calcium channels and increased expression of endothelin and generation of reactive oxygen species.",

Observed histologic changes in the liver have included steatosis, cholestasis, and zone 3 necrosis.

Copper poisoning leads to a hemolytic anemia related to several effects on erythrocytes that include inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, inhibition of glycolysis, denaturation of hemoglobin (with Heinz body formation), and oxidation of glutathione. The largest series of cases of acute poisoning with copper sulfate, ingested for suicidal purposes, was reported from New Delhi, India (Chuttani et al. 1965). Jaundice appeared on the second or third day in 11 of 48 patients (23.0%). In five patients, the jaundice was deep, the liver was enlarged and tender, the average total serum bilirubin was 11.2 \u00b1 809 mg/dL, the AST averaged 252.4 \u00b1 142 units, and the prothrombin time was markedly prolonged. In the remaining six patients, the jaundice was mild, the serum bilirubin was about 3.0 mg/dL, and the AST averaged 144 \u00b1 80 IU. Histologic changes in biopsy or autopsy material showed zone three necrosis and cholestasis in the deeply jaundiced patients and focal necrosis or no changes in the mildly jaundiced patients. When measured, the serum copper levels have been markedly elevated in acute copper intoxication (Chuttani et al. 1965; Blomfield et al. 1971; Holtzman et al. 1986), as well as in the liver (Blomfield et al. 1971).",

(1983) pro-posed that increased dietary copper (from copper-contaminated milk stored in brass and copper containers) could be of etiologic significance in ICC. Subsequently, O\u2019Neill and Tanner (1989) demonstrated experimentally that copper (but not zinc) is avidly taken up from brass and bound to casein from which it is completely removable by picolinate chelation. They concluded that milk is an effective carrier of copper from a brass utensil to the infant enterocyte. Lending support to a direct cytopathic effect of copper are recent reports of clinical recovery, improved survival, and reversal of the hepatic histological lesions by penicillamine therapy of infants with ICC (Tanner et al. 1987; Bhusnurmath et al. 1991).",

            "text": "Of great interest are reports of several children who developed an illness, clinically and histopathologically resembling ICC, from the chronic ingestion of well water contaminated with high levels of copper (M\u00fcller-H\u00f6cker et al. 1985, 1987; Schramel et al. 1988). In all cases, the copper was leached from copper pipes into drinking water delivered to the children\u2019s homes. Early exposure to copper appears to be crucial, because siblings exposed after 9 months of age and the parents who drank the same water did not develop the disease (M\u00fcller-H\u00f6cker et al. 1985; Schramel et al. 1988). Other cases of \u201cnon-Indian childhood cirrhosis,\u201d also referred to as \u201cidiopathic hepatic copper toxicosis,\u201d not specifically related to increased dietary copper intake have been reported (Maggiore et al. 1987; Horslen et al. 1994; Ludwig et al. 1995). To date, most of the affected children have succumbed to liver failure. It is conceivable that some cases of ICC occurring outside the Indian subcontinent are examples of environmental chronic copper toxicity, but other cases are not. The occurrence of the disease in siblings and parental consanguinity in two cases suggest a genetic abnormality, possibly an autosomal recessive disorder (Scheinberg and Sternlieb 1994). Lack of support for excess dietary copper as a cause of non-Indian childhood cirrhosis comes from a study of Scheinberg and Sternlieb (1994) in which no liver-related deaths were found in children less that 6 years of age in three Massachusetts towns with high copper concentrations in drinking water. The study covered 64,124 child-years of exposure. Of relevance to these observations are cases of endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis, which is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance but requires an additional risk factor such as excess dietary copper (from cows\u2019 milk contaminated with copper leached from untinned copper or brass containers) for its expression (M\u00fcller et al. 1996). The disease was eradicated when the untinned copper containers were replaced by modern industrial vessels.",

There is one report of chronic toxicity from massive ingestion of copper coins; 275 copper coins were found at autopsy in the stomach of a mentally deranged person (Yelin et al. 1987). Corrosion of the coins led to absorption of copper from the stomach, resulting in liver and kidney injury. The changes in the liver resembled those of ICC and childhood hepatic copper toxicosis. It is important to remember that accumulation of copper occurs in a number of chronic cholestatic conditions, most frequently in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Although demonstration of the stored copper, mainly periportal, is of diagnostic value, it does not appear to be a risk factor for progression of the disease, and attempts at removing the copper by penicillamine therapy have been abandoned.",

In the last condition, no association between genetic hemochromatosis and AAT deficiency was found in one study (Fargion et al. 1996). In another study, the association of AAT deficiency and genetic hemochromatosis led to an earlier onset of cirrhosis in genetic hemochromatosis, but it did not increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (Elzouki et al. 1995). In porphyria cutanea tarda, 60\u201370% of patients have mild to moderate iron overload, and approximately 10% have increases in the range of genetic hemochromatosis; the major cause is the presence of mutations of the HFE gene (Bonkovsky and Lambrecht 2000). Hepatic iron accumulation can occur in a number of acquired diseases of the liver (Table 25.3). The ones discussed briefly here are chronic hepatitis C, nonalcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and post-portacaval shunt surgery.",

            "text": "Hepatic iron accumulation occurs in chronic hepatitis C. In one study from Italy, 10% of patients with chronic hepatitis C had an elevated hepatic iron content (Riggio et al. 1997). Stainable iron in sinusoidal cells and portal tracts reflects an increased hepatic iron concentration, and elevated serum iron values have been linked to poor responses of chronic hepatitis C to interferon therapy. In one study, hepatic iron accumulation was found to be significantly associated with histologic activity and cirrhosis (Hezode et al. 1999). Barton et al. (1995) have suggested that the percentage of portal areas staining for iron should be included in the pathology report of liver biopsies; these investigators found that patients who respond to interferon therapy have less than 40% portal areas positive for iron. Enhanced iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation were improved by interferon therapy in one study (Kageyama et al. 2000). Pirisi et al. (2000) believed that interface hepatitis (piecemeal necrosis) and its sequelae (sinusoidal capillarization and microshunting) are major factors in iron deposition in chronic hepatitis C. HFE mutations are not responsible for the iron deposition but could favor the progression of virus-induced damage independently from interference with iron metabolism. The topic of iron and its relationship to chronic viral hepatitis is reviewed in detail by Bonkovsky et al. (1996, 1999).",

It is very common in many types of nonbiliary cirrhosis and appears to be acquired and to occur rapidly once cirrhosis develops (Ludwig et al. 1997). Quantitative iron determinations cannot be relied on to differentiate such cases from GH. Patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis can accumulate iron (and zinc) after end-to-side portacaval shunting, but quantitative iron analyses have shown that such patients have far less iron than patients with GH, and they are unlikely to have tissue injury resulting from the iron overload (Adams et al. 1994).",

Those with C282Y mutations had significantly higher levels of serum ALT and greater hepatic fibrosis than those without. In another study of 51 patients with NASH from Australia, the C282Y mutation was found to be responsible for most of the mild iron overload, and it was significantly associated with hepatic damage in these patients (George et al. 1998).
