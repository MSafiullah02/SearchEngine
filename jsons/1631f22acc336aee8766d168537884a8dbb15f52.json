Approximately 70% of the time ORF1a is translated to produce a 495-kDa polyprotein. About 30% of the time, ribosomal slippage results in an ORF1ab 803-kDa polyprotein via a ribosomal frameshift. These polyproteins are autocleaved both co-and post-translationally by two papain-like proteinases (PLP1 and PLP2) and a main proteinase (Mpro) to generate a series of intermediates and precursors that are completely processed into ~16 nonstructural proteins (nsp). These proteins include the three viral proteinases, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an RNA helicase, four putative RNA-processing enzymes, and approximately seven proteins of unknown functions. 1, 2 Confocal immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that many of these replicase proteins co-localize with the viral RdRp to intracellular double-membrane vesicles, where together they form the viral replication complex. 3 One of these proteins, nsp10, a 15-kDa product (139 amino acids) encoded at the 3' end of ORF1a, has been shown by yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses to interact with itself, nsp7 (p10), and nsp1 (p28) 4 ; by IFA to co-localize to the same region as the replication complexes 5 ; and by gene knockout to be required for replication.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 776, "end": 778, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 779, "end": 780, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1005, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1226, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Our initial approach was to delete nsp10, followed by altering the nsp9/10 cleavage signal.
