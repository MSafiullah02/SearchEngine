Although those two have not systematically studied infectious diseases yet, they have been appointed as a leading government official for the matter due to the Korean president\u2019s political interests. In carrying out this role, they designated quarantine stations in Jincheon and Asan in Chungbuk province to accommodate Koreans returning from Wuhan, China. However, these locations, which are far from international airports, were chosen without a consensus among local residents.",

Based on pictures and videos uploaded on social networks, these patients are in desperate need of assistance. Some, but not all, victims have aggressively pursued their self-interests, with a few patients preferring to hide instead of reporting to health centers or calling 1339 for help. Other patients have not fully cooperated with the first responders due to miscommunication or lack of emergency awareness.",

In addition, Chinese importers have purchased large amounts of face masks and hand sanitizers, in violation of Korean trade regulations. With about 70,000 Chinese students expected to return to Korean colleges for the beginning of the spring semester around the end of February, many local colleges have postponed classes to mid-March to prevent the potential spread of the coronavirus.",

In the former, the emergency response operates in behalf of political interests, whereas in the latter, the effort focuses on mitigating various risks related to the emergency. The risk-oriented response is theoretically preferred in emergency management. Therefore, Korea should adopt this approach against COVID-19 outbreak, such as in selecting the location of quarantine stations. Similarly, in appointing the lead government official, ability rather than rank should be the main consideration. Otherwise, leadership around coronavirus would not be much appreciated.",
