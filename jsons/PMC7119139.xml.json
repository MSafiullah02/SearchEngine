There are 1 million hospitalizations annually owing to CAP in the United States, with a cost of approximately 9 billion dollars per year [11]. Approximately 10% of all hospitalized patients require intensive care unit admission [12], [13], [14]. Hospitalized patients with CAP are at risk for significant mortality depending on the severity of illness. Several studies have reported a mortality rate of approximately 10% for hospitalized ward patients and a rate of 30% to 60% for patients who require intensive care unit admission [4]. A meta-analysis of published clinical studies that evaluated short-term mortality in hospitalized CAP patients reported a 5.1% mortality rate for ambulatory or ward hospital patients and a 36.5% mortality rate for patients treated in an intensive care unit [15].",

Prior antibiotic use has been defined in CAP clinical practice guidelines as the use of any antibiotic regimen in the past 3 months. Such use is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality [8]. The most common comorbid illnesses are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is present in as many as half of these patients, followed by alcoholism, chronic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus [4], [8], [9], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Other comorbid associated conditions include renal failure, neurologic disease, malnutrition, hepatic disease, bacteremia, a smoking history, and gross aspiration [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Approximately one third of patients with CAP were previously healthy [20]. Elderly and nursing home patients are at significant risk for CAP and have high mortality rates, although some experts consider pneumonia occurring in nursing home patients to be hospital-acquired pneumonia owing to the similarities in the etiologic pathogens [23]. The main causes of death in patients with severe CAP include refractory hypoxemia, refractory shock, and other pneumonia-related complications, predominantly multiorgan failure [24], [25], [26]. Mortensen et al [27] evaluated the causes of death and the timing and risk factors associated with pneumonia-related and pneumonia-unrelated mortality for patients with CAP within 90 days of presentation. Pneumonia-related death was 7.7 times more likely to occur within 30 days of presentation when compared with pneumonia-unrelated mortality. The prognosis beyond 45 days was influenced by the patient's age, sex, and other significant comorbid conditions [27].",

Fine and colleagues [29] developed a pneumonia-specific severity of illness (PSI) score as part of the pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team Study (PORT). The primary goal of the PSI was to identify low-risk patients who might be managed safely at home. The 20 parameters include three demographic variables, five comorbid conditions, five physical examination findings, and seven laboratory/imaging results. For each variable present, points are added to the score, and the final score is then divided into five risk classes. Patients in risk classes I to III are at low mortality risk, with a rate less than 1%, and can be managed as outpatients. Patients with a risk classification of IV have a 9% mortality rate, and class V patients have a 27% mortality rate [29]. The study suggested that patients in classes IV and V might require hospitalization. In a follow-up study, the same investigators suggested a three-step process to decide the initial site of CAP treatment based on (1) an assessment of pre-existing conditions that compromise the safety of home care, (2) calculation of the PSI score, and (3) clinical judgment [33].",

Subsequently, a new prediction rule was studied based on the modified BTS rule. This rule was called CURB (Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen >7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate \u226530/minute, and low systolic [<90 mm Hg] or diastolic [<60 mm Hg] Blood pressure) [37], [38]. Age greater than 65 years was independently associated with a poor outcome and was added to create a six-level CURB-65 score. A similar score with blood urea nitrogen omitted was created to apply this rule to the outpatient setting [39]. This score, CRB-65, is a five-level score correlating with mortality, allowing the identification of patients at low, intermediate, and high risk of death [39].",

The most recent ATS criteria rule published in 2001 was the best discriminator of intensive care unit admission and the need for mechanical ventilation (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.68 and 0.74, respectively), but none of the prediction rules was particularly good. The PSI score was the best predictor of medical complications and death (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.65 and 0.75, respectively) [40].

Houck et al reported that antibiotic administration within 4 hours of arrival was associated with decreased mortality and length of stay among a random sample of older inpatients with CAP who had not received antibiotics as outpatients [41]. Empiric therapy should be directed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and gram-negative bacilli with beta-lactam medications or new respiratory fluoroquinolones. Legionella spp (and other atypical pathogens) should be covered with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone [4], [7], [8], [9]. Mixed infections with typical and atypical pathogens occur in approximately 10% to 20% of cases and should always be considered to ensure that patients are treated with appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy [4], [7], [8], [9]. In cases in which the infecting pathogen can be identified, directed therapy should be employed [4], [7], [8], [9]. In all clinical series, approximately 40% to 70% of patients with CAP have no pathogen identified [18], [21], [42]. The failure to identify a pathogen has not been associated with a worse outcome, but the empiric regimen should cover S pneumoniae and atypical pathogens [12], [13].",

In a retrospective record review of 12,945 Medicare inpatients (aged 65 years or older), Gleason et al [43] showed that initial treatment of CAP with a second-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, a non\u2013antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or a fluoroquinolone alone was independently associated with lower 30-day mortality in patients with PSI classes IV and V. Burgess and Lewis [44] performed a retrospective evaluation of 213 hospitalized (not in the intensive care unit) patients with CAP and concluded that the addition of a macrolide to a non\u2013antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin as initial therapy for the treatment of CAP may not be necessary. Nevertheless, other reports suggest that the use of a combination regimen with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone alone is associated with a better outcome than the use of a beta-lactam alone [45], [46], [47], [48].",

Two studies (one randomized control trial and one cohort study) used the ATS severity criteria, and two cohort studies used the PSI score. The only randomized control trial had a much lower mortality rate than the other studies and used an unusual antimicrobial combination therapy (beta-lactam versus teicoplanin plus ciprofloxacin) that is not one of the recommended regimens put forth by the different clinical guidelines.

Waterer et al [53] found that single-effective drug therapy for severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a greater risk of death than was dual-effective therapy. Two other studies suggested a benefit of having a macrolide added to the beta-lactam therapy in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia [54], [55]. Not adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam\u2013based initial antibiotic regimen was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality [54].

A meta-analysis by Rhew et al evaluated early intravenous to oral conversion and discharge strategies in patients with CAP.

An intravenous beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide or antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone should be provided for intensive care unit patients without risk of having pseudomonas. Antipseudomonal therapy is indicated in patients with risk factors for pseudomonas who are admitted to the intensive care unit.
