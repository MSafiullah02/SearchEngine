For example, medical and healthcare students in colleges and universities volunteered to work on the front lines of epidemic prevention and control. In Beijing, 170 student volunteers from Capital Medical University assisted with response efforts at Capital Airport, and similar volunteering also occurred in Fujian. The public actively supported the government\u2019s Influenza A (H1N1) prevention and control measures, and voluntarily took part in the process via the Internet and other media channels; for example volunteers called those who had just returned from abroad and informed them of potential isolation measures. At the same time, increased public health awareness was also instrumental in successfully dealing with the disease.",

This clarification brought about effective collaboration between the government and the society in public health emergency management. The Beijing Immigration Inspection and Quarantine Bureau employed risk analysis methods in its prevention and control efforts and ensured electronic transfer of information on inbound passengers, which not only increased quarantine and inspection efficiency but also scientifically and efficiently improved response measures. Fujian was the country\u2019s first province to implement temporary isolation measures through its local Health Department. Henan created an epidemic prevention and control network of \u201cthree horizontal fronts\u201d\u2014arrangements at a government level, measures at enterprise (institution) level, and protection at a local level; and \u201cthree vertical fronts\u201d\u2014government supervision, inter-departmental collaboration, and public opinion guidance.
