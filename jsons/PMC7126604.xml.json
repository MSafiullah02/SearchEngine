Because of its extensive usages, Yao [2] outlined the theory of three-way decision. The basic idea of 3WD is to divide the universe of discourse into three disjoint subsets by given criteria. These three disjoint parts are called positive, negative and boundary regions from which one can construct different rules to make three-way decision. One can construct rules of acceptance from positive region, rules of rejection from negative region and rules of non-commitment from boundary region.",

            "text": "However, in FCA we can only get the two-way decision rather than the three-way decision. That is, based on a formal concept, one can only determine whether an object (attribute) certainly possesses (is shared by) all elements in the intent (extent) and such decision is called inclusion method. Actually, the formal context also offers us the information about whether an object (attribute) does not possesses (is not shared by) any attribute (object), which is called exclusion method, but this cannot be reflected in the formal concept. Since this kind of exclusion method is commonly used in our daily life, Qi et al. [23] applied 3WD to FCA and proposed three-way concept analysis (3WCA). Two key components in 3WCA are three-way concepts and three-way concept lattices. Similar with the formal concept in FCA, a three-way concept is also determined by two parts named extent and intent. However, the extent or intent of a three-way concept should be an orthopair studied by Ciucci [24]. That is to say, in 3WCA, \u201cthe extent (or the intent) of a three way concept is equipped with two parts: positive one and negative one. These two parts are used to express the semantics \u2018jointly possessed\u2019 and \u2018jointly not possessed\u2019 in a formal context.\u201d [25] This newly proposed three-way concept combines inclusion method (positive region) with exclusion method (negative region). Thus based on a three-way concept, one can divide the object (attribute) universe into three regions to make three-way decision.",

It is also an interesting topic in FCA. Many significant results in attribute reduction have been obtained based on a formal context. For example, Zhang et al. [36] discussed the lattice reduction theory where the notion of \u201creducing the context\u201d in [15] was developed. Within such framework, Zhang et al. [36] constructed judgment theorems of consistent sets, and developed approaches to attribute reduction based on discernibility matrix, which was given a further simplification by Qi [37] from the viewpoint of parent-child concepts. Based on the lattice reduction theory of formal contexts, Wei et al. [38] also studied the reduction theory of formal decision contexts under two different meanings of consistency. And Li et al. [39] have proposed the attribute reduction in order to preserve the rules in the formal decision context. On the other hand, Wang and Ma [40] proposed another attribute reduction in order to preserve the extents of meet-irreducible elements in the original formal concept lattice. Based on the irreducible elements, Li et al. [41] defined the join-irreducible attribute reduction in order to preserve the extents of join-irreducible elements in the original formal concept lattice. From the viewpoint of granular computing, granular reduction was proposed by Wu et al. [42] Additionally, Liu et al. [43] have studied the attribute reduction of object oriented formal concept lattices and property oriented formal concept lattices, and furthermore Wang et al. [44] discussed relations of attribute reductions between object and property oriented formal concept lattices.",

In order to make the discovery and representation of implicit knowledge in three-way concept lattices easier and simpler, based on the different criteria generated from three-way concepts, we firstly propose different attribute reductions. Since the generalization and the specialization of the knowledge contained in the context are all reflected in the three-way concept lattices, if our reduction can preserve the lattice structure, then the basic knowledge reflected in the three-way concept lattices is preserved. Also, because every three-way concept is the join (meet) of join (meet)-irreducible elements, if our reduction can preserve the irreducible elements, we actually preserve the basic elements in lattice construction. Thus this kind of reduction is very important in lattice construction. From the perspective of granular computation, a three-way object or attribute concept can be regarded as a kind of granule, so a kind of attribute reduction which can preserve the extents of the three-way object (attribute) concepts is proposed. All these attribute reductions together embody different characteristics of a context. The basic ideas of these attribute reductions are similar with the classical attribute reductions mentioned in the previous paragraph. However, different from the attribute reductions in FCA, all the reductions in this paper depend on the three-way concept and the three-way concept can reflect more information than the classical formal concept, so the results and meaning of these attribute reductions in 3WCA are different with the classical ones in FCA. Then, we analyze the relationships among these three-way reductions. Finally, we give some approaches to these attribute reductions. Since the study we make is based on the three-way concept analysis, our work can be regarded as a three-way extension of the attribute reductions mentioned in previous paragraph.",

The elements of G are called the objects and the elements of M are called the attributes of the context. In order to express that an object x is in a relation I with an attribute m, we write xIm or (x, m) \u2208 I and read it as \u201cthe object x has the attribute m\u201d.A pair of operators are defined on X \u2286 G and A \u2286 M respectively in (G, M, I) [15]:\nX*={m|m\u2208M,\u2200x\u2208X,xIm}A*={x|x\u2208G,\u2200m\u2208A,xIm}\nThe operator * is same with the modal-style operator R\u0394 in [45], which expresses the meaning of jointly possessing.The properties of this pair of operators are shown in [15], so we do not describe here.\nDefinition 2[15]A formal concept of the context (G, M, I) is a pair (X, A) with X*=A and X=A*(X \u2286 G, A \u2286 M). We call X the extent and A the intent of the formal concept (X, A).The formal concepts of a formal context (G, M, I) are ordered by\n(X1,A1)\u2264(X2,A2)\u21d4X1\u2286X2(\u21d4A1\u2287A2).\nAll formal concepts of (G, M, I) can form a complete lattice called the formal concept lattice of (G, M, I) and denoted by L(G, M, I). The infimum and supremum are given by\n(X1,A1)\u2227(X2,A2)=(X1\u2229X2,(A1\u222aA2)**)\n(X1,A1)\u2228(X2,A2)=((X1\u222aX2)**,A1\u2229A2)\nIn order to distinguish from the following three-way concept analysis, the formal concept mentioned above will be called classical concept and other notions in the FCA also be named in the same way in the following parts of this paper.Now, we give the definition of reduct as follows.\nDefinition 3[36]Let (G, M, I) be a formal context. If there exists an attribute set D \u2286 M such that L(G, D, ID)\u2245L(G, M, I), then D is called a consistent set of (G, M, I). And further, if \u2200d\u2208D,L(G,D\u2212{d},ID\u2212{d})\u2247L(G,M,I), the set D is called a reduct of (G, M, I). The intersection of all the reducts is called the core of (G, M, I). Here ID=I\u2229(G\u00d7D).\nDefinition 4[46]Let L be a lattice.

If set D is an OE-granular consistent set of (G, M, I), and there is no proper subset E \u2282 D such that E is an OE-granular consistent set of (G, M, I), then set D is called an OE-granular reduct of (G, M, I).Here, \u22d6D and \u22d7D are the three-way operators in (G, D, ID).\n",

            "text": "The four different object-induced three-way attribute reductions embody different characteristics of a formal context. The OE-lattice reduction preserves the OE-lattice of the context. Since the OE-lattice can reflect the hierarchical knowledge of the context, the OE-lattice reduction can preserve this kind of hierarchical knowledge of the context. But it needs to consider all the OE-concepts, which let OE-lattice reduction more difficult to be computed. The OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction is to preserve the extents of the meet (join)-irreducible elements of the OE-concept lattice. Because every OE-concept is meet (join) of meet (join)-irreducible elements of the OE-lattice, the meet (join)-irreducible elements are the basic elements of lattice construction. Thus, although the OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction cannot preserve all the hierarchical knowledge of the context, it still plays an important role in lattice construction. Also since OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction only considers the irreducible elements, the results are easy to be computed. The OE-granular reduction is to preserve the extent of the OE-object concept which can be regarded as a kind of information granule from the perspective of granular computing. Thus OE-granular reduction is meaningful in granular computing. Since it only considers OE-object concepts, compared with other OE-reductions, the computation is the simplest. From Definition 7 to 10, we find that these different attribute reductions consider different perspectives or different information of the context and they can be used in different occasions. If we want to preserve all the knowledge of the context, we need to use OE-lattice reduction; if we want to preserve the basic elements of lattice construction, we need to use OE-MIE (JIE)-preserving reduction; if we want to preserve the information granules, we need to use OE-granular reduction. The above discussions are about the differences of these four OE-reductions which are summarized in Table 1. Now, let us discuss the relationships among these four OE-attribute reductions.\nLemma 1[46]\nLet L be a finite lattice. Every element is join (meet) of join-irreducible (meet-irreducible) elements.\n\nTheorem 2\nLet (G, M, I) be a formal context, then\nCS(OEL)=CS(OEM),\nRed(OEL)=Red(OEM)\nand\nCore(OEL)=Core(OEM)\n.\n\nProofFirstly, we give the proof of CS(OEL)=CS(OEM).If D \u2208 CS(OEL), then ExtOEL(G,M,I)=ExtOEL(G,D,ID) holds by Definition 7. For any X \u2208 ExtOEM(G, M, I), from the definition of meet-irreducible element, we can get X \u2260 Y \u2229 Z ( \u2200 Y, Z \u2208 ExtOEL(G, M, I) and Y \u2260 X, Z \u2260 X). And because of ExtOEL(G,M,I)=ExtOEL(G,D,ID),\nX \u2208 ExtOEL(G, D, ID) and X \u2260 Y \u2229 Z ( \u2200 Y, Z \u2208 ExtOEL(G, D, ID) and Y \u2260 X, Z \u2260 X). So, according to the definition of meet-irreducible elements, X \u2208 ExtOEM(G, D, ID). Thus ExtOEM(G, M, I) \u2286 ExtOEM(G, D, ID), and vice versa. Therefore ExtOEM(G,M,I)=ExtOEM(G,D,ID), that is D \u2208 CS(OEM). Thus CS(OEL) \u2286 CS(OEM).Suppose D \u2208 CS(OEM), we need to show ExtOEL(G,M,I)=ExtOEL(G,D,ID). Since ExtOEL(G, D, ID) \u2286 ExtOEL(G, M, I) holds for any D \u2286 M, we only need to prove ExtOEL(G, M, I) \u2286 ExtOEL(G, D, ID). For any X \u2208 ExtOEL(G, M, I), there exist Xi \u2208 ExtOEM(G, M, I) (i \u2208 \u03c4) such that X=\u2229i\u2208\u03c4Xi due to Lemma 1. Since ExtOEM(G,M,I)=ExtOEM(G,D,ID), and ExtOEM(G, D, ID) \u2286 ExtOEL(G, D, ID), we obtain X=\u2229i\u2208\u03c4Xi\u2208ExtOEL(G,D,ID). Thus, ExtOEL(G, M, I) \u2286 ExtOEL(G, D, ID). Therefore, ExtOEL(G,M,I)=ExtOEL(G,D,ID) which means D \u2208 CS(OEL). Hence, CS(OEM) \u2286 CS(OEL). So, we obtain CS(OEL)=CS(OEM).The first equation of this theorem shows that D is an OE-lattice consistent set if and only if D is an OE-MIE-preserving consistent set. Therefore, the following parts Red(OEL)=Red(OEM),\nCore(OEL)=Core(OEM) are naturally obtained. \u25a1\nLemma 2\nLet (G, M, I) be a formal context, D \u2286 M, and X \u2286 G. We have X\n\u22d6D\u22d7D\u2287X\n\u22d6M\u22d7M\n; consequently, \u2200x \u2208 G, x\n\u22d6D\u22d7D\u2287x\n\u22d6M\u22d7M\n. If D is an OE-lattice consistent set, then the two equations hold.\n\nProof\u2200X \u2286 G, since D \u2286 M, we have X\n\u22d6D \u2286 X\n\u22d6M. Then, X\n\u22d6D\u22d7D\u2287X\n\u22d6M\u22d7M. Let X={x},\nx\n\u22d6D\u22d7D\u2287x\n\u22d6M\u22d7M holds naturally. Suppose set D is an OE-lattice consistent set. \u2200X \u2286 G, since X\n\u22d6D\u22d7D \u2208 ExtOEL(G, D, ID), X\n\u22d6M\u22d7M \u2208 ExtOEL(G, M, I), and ExtOEL(G,M,I)=ExtOEL(G,D,ID), there must be X\u22d6D\u22d7D=X\u22d6M\u22d7M. Similarly, let X={x},\nx\u22d6D\u22d7D=x\u22d6M\u22d7M also holds. \u25a1\n",

Assume (X,(xi*,xi*\u00af)) is an OE-object concept induced by xi. From Lemma 1 we know that (X,(xi*,xi*\u00af)) is a join of join-irreducible elements, and the necessity of Lemma 3 shows that the join-irreducible element of OEL(G, M, I) must be an OE-object concept, thus we have\n(X,(xi*,xi*\u00af))=(Y,(xj*,xj*\u00af))\u2228(Z,(xk*,xk*\u00af))=((Y\u222aZ)\u22d6\u22d7,(xj*,xj*\u00af)\u2229(xk*,xk*\u00af))=((Y\u222aZ)\u22d6\u22d7,(xj*\u2229xk*,xj*\u00af\u2229xk*\u00af))(xi,xj,xk\u2208G)Here (Y,(xj*,xj*\u00af))and(Z,(xk*,xk*\u00af)) are join-irreducible elements of OEL(G, M, I).

Suppose X\u22d6B\u22d7B=X and (Y, (C, D)) \u2208 PC(X, X\n\u22d6M).(i) If (Y, (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)) \u2208 OEL(G, M, I), then from X \u2282 Y, we can get (C\u2229B,D\u2229B)\u2282X\u22d6B=(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B), equivalently, B\u2229((X*M\u2212C)\u222a(X*M\u00af\u2212D))\u2260\u2300, obviously, B\u2229DISOEL((X,X\u22d6M),(Y,(C,D)))\u2260\u2300.(ii) If (Y, (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)) \u2209 OEL(G, M, I), then X \u2282 Y \u2282 (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)\u22d7B. Since((C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)\u22d7B, (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)\u22d7B\u22d6M) \u2208 OEL(G, M, I), we can get (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B) \u2286 (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B)\u22d7B\u22d6M \u2282 X\n\u22d6M. Moreover, it\u2019s sure that (C \u2229 B, D \u2229 B) \u2282 X\n\u22d6B. Because if X\u22d6B=(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B)=(C\u2229B,D\u2229B), then X=X\u22d6B\u22d7B=(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B)\u22d7B=(C\u2229B,D\u2229B)\u22d7B, which is a contradiction. Thus (C\u2229B,D\u2229B)\u2282(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B), that is B\u2229DISOEL((X,X\u22d6M),(Y,(C,D)))\u2260\u2300.Sufficiency. Assume B\u2229DISOEL((X,X\u22d6M),(Y,(C,D)))\u2260\u2300 for any (Y, (C, D)) \u2208 PC(X, X\n\u22d6M) and X\n\u22d6B\u22d7B \u2260 X. Then we have X\u2282X\u22d6B\u22d7B=X\u22d6B\u22d7M. Since (X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M, X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M) \u2208 OEL(G, M, I), we obtain (X, X\n\u22d6M) < (X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M, X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M). Moreover, it\u2019s sure that (X, X\n\u22d6M)\u227a(X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M, X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M). If there is (Z, (E, F)) \u2208 OEL(G, M, I) such that (X, X\n\u22d6M)\u227a(Z, (E, F)) < (X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M, X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M), then X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M \u2282 (E, F) \u2282 X\n\u22d6M, which implies X\u22d6B\u22d7M*M\u2229B,X\u22d6B\u22d7M*M\u00af\u2229B)\u2286(E\u2229B,F\u2229B)\u2286(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B). From the assumption, (E\u2229B,F\u2229B)\u2282(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B), and because X\n\u22d6B \u2286 X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M, we get X\u22d6B\u2286(E\u2229B,F\u2229B)\u2282(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B)=X\u22d6B, which is impossible. Thus (X, X\n\u22d6M)\u227a(X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M, X\n\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M). From assumption, we have B\u2229DISOEL((X,X\u22d6M),(X\u22d6B\u22d7M,X\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M))\u2260\u2300, that is, (X\u22d6B\u22d7M*M\u2229B,X\u22d6B\u22d7M*M\u00af\u2229B)\u2282(X*M\u2229B,X*M\u00af\u2229B). So, X\u22d6B=X\u22d6B\u2229(B,B)\u2286X\u22d6B\u22d7M\u22d6M\u2229(B,B)\u2282X\u22d6B, which is impossible. Hence, X\u22d6B\u22d7B=X. \u25a1\n",

The details are as follows:\nExample 3\nTable 5\ndepicts a dataset of four patients who suffer from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [47]. Let G be the set of four patients and M be the set of five symptoms. For convenience, we denote the four patients by 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, and the five symptoms (Fever, Cough, Headache, Difficulty Breathing and Diarrhea) by a, b, c, d, e, respectively. That is G={1,2,3,4} and M={a,b,c,d,e}.\n",

Then we investigated the relationships among these newly proposed attribute reductions, the relationships among their consistent sets, as well as the relationships among their cores. Also, we have presented the approaches to computing most of these reductions. Finally, an empirical case is shown to illustrate our analysis. Since three-way concept analysis can be regarded as an extension of formal concept analysis and the three-way concept lattice can reflect more knowledge than the classical one, the study of the three-way concept lattice is a newly proposed but meaningful part of formal concept analysis. Also because the attribute reductions of three-way concept lattices are necessary in three-way concept analysis, the attribute reductions we discussed in this paper enrich the study of formal concept analysis.",

Also, since the three-way concept analysis can be regarded as a generalization of the classical formal concept analysis, there must exist some relationships between these two theories. Hence, the relationship among the attribute reductions on these two theories should be studied in the future. Actually, for any kind of attribute reduction mentioned in this paper, the attributes can be classified into three types according to their roles in the reduction [36]. Let (G, M, I) be a formal context. For a certain kind of reduction, suppose the set {Di|Di is a reduct, i \u2208 \u03c4}(\u03c4 is an index set) includes all associated reducts of (G, M, I). Then attributes in M can be classified into three types: absolutely necessary attribute, also called core attribute (attribute in  \u2229 i \u2208 \u03c4\nDi ), relatively necessary attribute (attribute in \u222ai\u2208\u03c4Di\u2212\u2229i\u2208\u03c4Di ), and absolutely unnecessary attribute (attribute in M\u2212\u222ai\u2208\u03c4Di). Of course, different attributes play different roles in different reductions. For further research, it is of significance to investigate their relationships based on different reductions. Also, in order to apply the theories we discussed in this paper in the real world, in the future, we will propose the corresponding algorithms of these eight different attribute reductions, which may help us to deal with the big data problems in our daily lives more conveniently. And the utility value will also be introduced and added to every concept and the new attribute reductions based on the utility value will be studied, which will make our study more suitable in practices.",
