A fast track intubation was performed using a 8 mm single-lumen oro-tracheal tube with the support of videolaringoscope. Thus, the patient was transferred to a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit. Immediately, the patient presented progressive subcutaneous emphysema. A flexible bronchoscopy was performed, revealing a level II tracheal laceration of about 1 cm in the membranous wall, about 2 cm distally to the vocal cords. Considering the dimension and characteristics of the rupture, a conservative management was firstly considered convenient. The oro-tracheal tube was endoscopically positioned with the cuff located distally to the lesion. Nevertheless, the subcutaneous emphysema continued to worsen (Figure1), reaching zygomatic and periorbital region, the whole chest bilaterally and the arms, accompanied by atrial fibrillation and hemodynamic instability.

Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are the most common clinical manifestation, however it can lead to more sever conditions like bilateral pneumothorax, hemodynamic 5 instability, mediastinitis and sepsis. The treatment options include non-invasive interventions such positioning the tracheal tube cuff distal to the lesion and observation. Surgery is indicated in case of large tracheal ruptures, type III A-B lesions (4), ventilatory instability, mediastinitis or a progressive increase in subcutaneous emphysema (3) . For injuries of the proximal one-third of the trachea, a transcervical approach, firstly proposed by Angelillo-Mackinlay, is preferred over traditional right thoracotomy because of its less invasiveness. More recently, a transcervical-transtracheal approach that includes a T-shaped tracheotomy, has been proposed for post-intubation tracheal injury (5).",
