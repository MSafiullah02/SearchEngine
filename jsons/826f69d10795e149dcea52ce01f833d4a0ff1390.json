Qualitative research shows that hand and respiratory hygiene were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take but that there is ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma 7 . In the context of COVID-19, which appears to transmit readily and to have an appreciably higher case fatality than H1N1pdm2009 8 , social distancing measures maybe warranted to slow the spread of the infection.",

            "text": "Respiratory infections transmit through contact and airborne routes. In contact transmission self-inoculation of mucous membranes by contaminated hands may involve direct transfer of virus from one infected person to another or indirect transfer of virus through contaminated intermediate objects (fomites). Airborne transmission can involve droplets (>5 \u03bcm) which can lead to short range transmission through direct deposition of droplets on mucous membranes and the upper respiratory tract through coughing, sneezing and breathing of the infected individual and aerosol transmission with droplet nuclei which can remain suspended in the air for long periods and be inhaled and deposited along the respiratory tract, including the lower airways 9 . Assessing the relative importance of these modalities in respiratory infection transmission is complex. The relative importance may also vary by setting and pathogen. In the context of crowded public spaces rather than direct contact with infected individuals indirect contact and aerosol transmission may become relatively more important than in the context of face to face contact with infected individuals. Understanding the extent to which exposure to potentially crowded public places increases the risk of acquiring common respiratory infections, could help to inform control of emerging respiratory infections, which likely transmit using similar modalities.We aimed to assess this through analysis of the Flu Watch study 10 , a large community cohort study that was designed to investigate incidence and risk factors for influenza.",

Participants were randomly selected from patient lists of general practitioners and sent letters to recruit the whole household. Those with terminal illness or who were participating in other research studies were excluded. Households were recruited in the autumn and followed up through winter periods until spring. During follow up, participants were contacted weekly and asked to report whether they had a cough, cold, sore throat or fever. They were also asked to complete illness diaries recording symptoms for any acute respiratory illness. In this study we are utilising self-reported respiratory infection regardless of whether or not the infection was laboratory confirmed. During the first three years of Flu Watch (2006/7, 2007/8, 2008/9 ) illness diaries included a series of questions on how many days in the week before illness onset a series of activities had occurred. These activities were: use of bus, underground train, train, plane, public house/bar/ nightclub, eating out at a restaurant/caf\u00e9/canteen, going to a place of worship, going to a party for adults, going to the supermarket or small shops, going to the cinema/theatre/ sports event, and playing sport., The same questions were asked at baseline.

We used a case-crossover design 12 , in which cases act as their own controls during a non-exposure time-period (i.e. baseline in the present study), to investigate whether exposure to the public in venues such as public transport, supermarkets, cinemas etc. and contact with those with the common cold were associated with acute respiratory infection syndromes. Case-crossover designs are appropriate to investigate the effect of transient exposures (e.g. exposure to infections in public places) on an acute outcome (e.g. acute respiratory infection syndrome) within a plausible hazard period (e.g. one week, to account for the 1-7 day incubation period of commonly circulating respiratory pathogens 13 ). As this is a paired test, comparing individuals in the week before baseline (referent period) with themselves in the week before illness onset (hazard period), non-time varying variables cannot act as confounders.",

Stata mi logit commands were used to impute missing data for binary exposure variables (activity conducted during week vs activity not conducted) using season, age group, gender, and illness vs baseline as predictors. We did not attempt to impute the frequency of exposure (0/7 days). In the UK context, social activities such as going to parties, meals out, or going out to public houses, bars or nightclubs increase in the period before Christmas and New Year, so, for these activities we excluded illnesses occurring in weeks 50 to week 1 (equating to exposures in week 49-52). Attendance at a place of worship is also more common for Christmas related services so we excluded illnesses in weeks 51 and 52 (equating to exposures in week 50 and 51) for the 'visiting a place of worship' activity.",

Our findings are robust to adjustment for time of year (season) and, for exposures that are strongly associated with the Christmas period, to removal of illnesses occurring in the run up to Christmas and New Year. We cannot exclude that our findings may be influenced by time-dependent variations in activities and levels of respiratory illness that are not accounted for by these measures, but note that our findings are consistent across a wide range of plausible public activities.

            "text": "In the context of widespread transmission of an emerging respiratory infection with appreciable mortality and morbidity (such as COVID-19) these findings support the need for people with symptoms of respiratory infection to minimise contact with others, for example through self-isolation or working from home. Minimising public activities such as use of public transport, shopping, eating out, attending entertainment venues, going to parties and places of worship may be helpful in slowing the spread of infection and reducing peak intensity of transmission and associated healthcare usage. Minimising exposure to public venues may be of particular relevance for the elderly and those with chronic illness who are more likely than healthy young adults to develop complications of infection and to die. The impact of reducing contact with crowds on quality of life, personal autonomy, livelihoods and the wider economy need to be balanced with the potential reduction in attack rates and the potential to reduce surges in healthcare activity and mortality.

The present analysis is concurrent with the initial wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, during which many countries resorted to using the social distancing measures of previously unseen intensity, duration and geographic scope, most notably nationwide \"lockdowns\", in an effort to avert complete collapse of health care infrastructure due to rapidly growing numbers of severely ill cases requiring prolonged hospital stays including intensive care. This paper reports the unique data on pre-pandemic exposure patterns to crowded public settings including local and long-range public transport, retail and restaurant facilities, sporting and art venues, places of worship and private functions. The case-crossover design is used to examine association between frequency and types of crowded settings attended, and a subsequent episode of self-reported infectious respiratory illness. As the SARS-CoV2 transmission will likely persist in large swaths of the globe well beyond the initial pandemic wave, results of this analysis are an important first step to better characterize the risk associated with frequenting crowded community settings and inform future public health strategies.",

The authors have done a secondary analysis of the FluWatch data to examine the association of social contacts with risk of respiratory virus infections. They find that exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections. This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections. The findings are important because social distancing is one of the most commonly used interventions against COVID-19, ranging from voluntary changes in behaviour right up to the mandatory lockdowns or \"shelter-in-place\" used in many countries in February, March and April 2020. What is now uncertain is the extent to which more modest social distancing strategies could achieve the objective of suppressing COVID-19 transmission.",
