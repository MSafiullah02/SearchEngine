Unfortunately, a sustained virological response to this therapy is limited to about 60% of treated patients.3\u20135 There is thus an urgent need for new treatment strategies. One promising approach is the development of small molecules that target specific enzymatic activities associated with the viral non-structural (NS) proteins, or inhibit specific interactions between viral proteins and viral or cellular co-factors.6,7 Several selective inhibitors, including NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase inhibitors, are now in clinical development.6,8\u201310 For most directly acting antivirals for HCV, rapid emergence of (many) resistant variants has been reported (both in vitro and in the clinical setting).11 The most successful approach to limiting drug resistance is the implementation of rationally designed drug combinations.12 A prerequisite for this type of therapy is the availability of multiple selective drugs acting on different targets.",

Natural glycopeptide antibiotics have not been reported to exert any antiviral activity, but some of their semi-synthetic derivatives proved to be endowed with antiviral activity against retro- or coronaviruses.15\u201317 For HIV, it was shown that semi-synthetic aglycone glycopeptides potentially interfere with the viral entry process.17 These compounds also inhibited coronavirus replication by interfering with early step(s) of the viral life cycle.16 Here we report on the in vitro anti-HCV activity of some aglycone derivatives of teicoplanin.",

This may reduce the lead to a smaller molecule or delineate a substructure within the glycopeptide that may serve as a focal point for chemical modification. Most of the analogues in the LCTA-949 series (LCTA-1701 to -1707, Figure 1) were almost as active as the parent compound (Table 2 and Figure 2), arguing for a major role of the teicoplanin peptide scaffold. Chemical modification may also help to optimize the pharmacological properties of this class of molecules. Chemical modification of vancomycin resulted, for example, in the development of oritavancin, a molecule with a very long half-life (393 h) that is distributed, for example, to the liver.28 The limited oral availability of glycopeptides has been overcome by formulating, for example, vancomycin in liposomes or solid-state emulsions.30",

            "text": "Since neither viruses nor their mammalian host cells produce peptidoglycans, the mechanism of action of antibiotics with inhibitory activity against viruses certainly differs by definition from their mechanism against bacteria. Aglycone glycopeptide antibiotics target the entry of HIV15,17 and the early steps of the replication cycle of coronaviruses.16 The fact that these molecules inhibit the entry of these viruses does not necessarily mean that their mechanism against HCV must be similar. Geneticin, for example, has been shown to inhibit pestivirus assembly31 or release and the replication or translation of flaviviruses.32 Even though these viruses belong to the same family (Flaviviridae), they are inhibited by two different mechanisms. We demonstrate here that, unlike the case for HIV and coronaviruses, LCTA-949 inhibits HCV replication at a post-entry event. Indeed, the molecule inhibits the replication of HCV subgenomic replicons (which do not encode structural proteins) and the activity in replicons is comparable to that in the infectious HCV system. Furthermore, LCTA-949 is still active when added to HCV-infected cultures. Whether inhibition of intracellular replication is the result of a direct interaction with viral proteins or is mediated by interference with host cell factors remains to be elucidated. So far, we have not been able to select drug-resistant variants despite several months of attempts. Interestingly, oritavancin has been shown to interfere with intracellular cholesterol and phospholipid metabolism33 and membrane organization and permeability.34 Both host cell lipid metabolism35 and membrane organization36 are important during HCV replication. It is thus possible that LCTA-949 might (i) target cellular factor(s) that is (are) essential for HCV replication or (ii) influence the cell's lipid metabolism in such a way that it counteracts HCV replication or disturbs membrane organization, which is important in the HCV replication cycle.",

Future HCV therapy will consist of a combination of two or more selective inhibitors.37 In line with this, we aimed to study the combined effect of LCTA-949 with either IFN or other HCV inhibitors (protease or polymerase inhibitors). Each of the combinations resulted in an overall additive antiviral effect (Figure 4). Hence, these compounds probably do not interfere with the mechanism of action of these selective inhibitors. This is further supported by the observation that LCTA-949 was equipotent against wild-type replicons and replicons resistant to various inhibitors of NS3 protease or nucleoside or non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase. LCTA-949 delayed or prevented resistance development (of replicons) to the protease inhibitor VX-950. More importantly, even after 4 months of continuous culture in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of LCTA-949, no HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to LCTA-949 emerged. The barrier to resistance of this class of compounds might therefore be high, assuming that the HCV quasispecies is equally diverse in vitro and in vivo.",
