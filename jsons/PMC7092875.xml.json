Microsatellites show wide distributions in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses [4], and have length polymorphism, motif diversity and non-random distribution characteristics [5]. Microsatellites are highly mutable and vary widely among individuals possibly as a result of strand slippage during replication [6,7]. These mutations may be correlated with the genomic structures and functions [8,9]. Thus, the emergence and fixation of microsatellites could contribute to the genomic diversity and evolution [10]. In addition, microsatellites expansion has been proved to cause more than 30 neurological and neuromuscular diseases [11], for instance, epilepsy caused by abnormal expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats [12], Huntington disease cansed by CAG repeats [13], etc. Also it is related to lung cancer [14], gastric cancer [15], etc. The occurrence of microsatellites in non-coding regions are also associated with diseases by regulating gene expression, such as Friedreich Ataxia [16].",

Microsatellites might potentially contribute to evolution of virus, through the comprehensive analysis of viral genomes in HIV-1 [17], Potyvirus [18] and HCV [19]. The distribution and composition of microsatellites in seven species of Filoviridae family, including Ebolavirus, also have salient features [20]. Ebolavirus comprises of five species: Zaire ebolavirus, Bundibugyo virus, Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus [21]. The Ebolavirus genome is a negative and single-stranded RNA approximately 19 kb nucleotides. It is organized into a 3\u2032 leader non-coding regions, followed by seven genes and a 5\u2032 trailer non-coding regions [22]. Microsatellites in non-coding regions account for a large proportion of the Ebolavirus genomes [20].",

In Picornaviridae genomes, the terminal sequences can form stem-loop secondary structures to play a role in the viral life cycle [25]. Similarly, there are the conserved secondary structures in potato virus X RNA [26], hepatitis C viruses [27] and coronavirus [28]. Microsatellites mainly exist in non-coding regions [6,29]. The conservation of microsatellites in non-coding regions may be important to gene regulation in plants [30]. In plant viroids, the distribution of microsatellites probably contributes to the secondary structure [31]. The present study is a systematic analysis for the microsatellites in 219 genomic sequences from five Ebolavirus species. To our knowledge, this may be the first study to investigate the related biological significance of microsatellites in virus.",

In view of this particular phenomenon, we mainly analyzed the terminal sequences further, and continue to study the Conserved 3 in the future. In order to verify the extremely high conservatism of conserved microsatellites at the terminal sequences, the conserved rate was analyzed and the counts subsequently compared across complete genomes. The highest conserved rate of the complete genomes was 8.20% \u00b1 0.30, while the highest one in the terminal regions was 100% \u00b1 0.00 (EBOV), which meant that there were only those two conserved microsatellites in all sequences. Conserved rate of the terminal sequences were considerably higher than those of complete genomes (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table S2). To observe the proportion of conserved microsatellites in the sequences, the relative abundance of the microsatellites was calculated to eliminate the influence of different lengths. Additionally, the perfect microsatellites were mainly analyzed in this step, so only completely conserved microsatellites were considered for further analysis. Relative abundances of conserved microsatellites in 5\u2032, 3\u2032 terminal sequences were significantly higher than those of complete genomes (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Table S2).",

All terminal sequences of five species were identified and they all form different secondary structures. However, the intuitive analysis of conserved microsatellite regions was affected by the multiple possibilities resulted from the algorithms in the process of prediction. While base pairing of the two conserved regions could lead to the formation of the base of the putative stem-loop structures, the intervening sequence variations altered the predictions for the rest of the structures [42]. Therefore, a segment of the conserved microsatellite region was intercepted for prediction, where the 5\u2032 terminal was truncated to about 48 nt, and the 3\u2032 terminal was truncated to about 50 nt (Table 1). Then these sequences of conserved microsatellite regions were put into an online secondary structure website for prediction, and accomplished with the comparison of multiple websites to ensure its accuracy. Thermodynamic modeling of Ebola viral RNA predicted the formation of RNA stem-loop structures at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal. All 5\u2032 terminal sequences formed similar stem-loop structures. Unlike the other three species, RESTV and SUDV did not appear the corner, however, they generally exhibited similar structures (Fig. 3\nA). Consistent with the 5\u2032 terminal, the secondary structures of 3\u2032 terminal were predicted (Fig. 3B).

The 3\u2032 trailer of Ebolavirus were essential for replication by formed a small stem-loop structure, and participated in RNA-Protein interaction [44]. The related results suggested that conserved microsatellites in the terminal regions of Ebolavirus were well base-paired to help forming conserved stem-loop structures (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. S2\u2013S19). Sequence analysis showed that the nucleic acid of Ebolavirus (EBOV, SUDV, RESTV, TAFV) between their 3\u2032 terminal (18 nt) and 5\u2032 terminal (20 nt) were highly identical [42], and conserved stem-loop structures were found [42,44,45], which proved the accuracy of the prediction results in this study. Here, we displayed the relationship between such structures and microsatellites to speculate on the role of microsatellites in Ebolavirus genome. Dinucleotide repeats have been demonstrated that can form secondary structure in eukaryotic genome [8]. And Qin et al. found that microsatellite distribution affects their secondary structure in plant viroids [31]. Therefore, the conserved microsatellites analyzed here indicated that they may contribute to the formation of the stem-loop structures in the terminal regions of Ebolavirus.",

            "text": "The distribution of microsatellites on Ebolavirus genomes had regional preference between and among species [20]. Due to the isolation of many viruses still require the differentiation of thousands of years [46], the viral genome often produces more mutations. Li et al. calculated that the common ancestor for five species of Ebolavirus was about 1257 years old [43]. According to the novel filamentous virus classification process, nucleotide level difference of less than 30% can be divided into the same species, and less than 50% can be divided into the same genera [21]. Therefore, Ebolavirus genomes had high similarities in same species, and there are large sequence variances among five species (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2). However, conserved microsatellites loci were mainly distributed in the terminal non-coding regions, and the terminal regions had larger sequence variances that might face with more selective pressures in contrast to complete genomes. Microsatellites were previously reported to be more abundant in non-coding regions [29,47]. According to statistics, except for the longest L gene, the microsatellites in the non-coding regions of Ebolavirus are the most [20]. However, in this research, the variances of the terminal sequences were clearly more than other sequences in Ebolavirus genomes. In addition, the microsatellites with CA and UG as motifs are not high in viral genome [4]. These conserved microsatellites can be preserved through the long evolutionary time, which mean that they perhaps occurred in the importantly locus.",

For example, some non-coding microsatellites were conserved in plants between species across hundreds of millions of years [30], and human genome have many highly conserved promoter microsatellites [51]. The original Ebolavirus genomes probably experienced powerful pressures and different fates through the series of selection, consequently, the adaptive ones were preserved [50,52].",

According to the stepwise mutation model, the microsatellite will gradually disappear into the process of evolution by means of point mutation [2]. BDBV, which was discovered and named only in 2007, has the highest similarity with TAFV [53]. This conserved locus may serve as another proof that these two species are more homologous than other Ebolavirus species. So the role of Conserved 4 in the Ebola virus deserves further study. In addition, there was a sequence (R3) of RESTV in Conserved 2, and UGUGUG is also mutated to UGUGUA, which might be the same case (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S1). However, these mutations did not affect the formation of secondary structures (Supplementary Fig. S8). In summary, conserved microsatellites might be a characteristic product of natural variation and deserves more research.",
