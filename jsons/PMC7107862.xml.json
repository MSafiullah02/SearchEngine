Case wards were hospital wards in which superspreading events of SARS occurred, and control wards were hospital wards in which patient(s) with SARS were admitted, but no superspreading events occurred. We defined a superspreading event as the development of \u22653 new cases of SARS in a ward during the period from 2 to 10 days after the admission of an identifiable index patient or as the development of a cluster of \u22653 new cases of SARS in a ward during a period of 8 days but without any known sources of SARS. There is no universally accepted critical (cutoff) number for defining a superspreading event, but because the basic reproductive number (R0) in the community was 2.7 [21], we adopted a more conservative operational definition, with a critical number of \u22653 new cases of SARS. Superspreading events were identified through reports of known nosocomial outbreaks of SARS from the infection-control units of all hospitals and through temporal clustering (detected by plotting the date of onset of symptoms for each case of SARS that occurred among health care workers and inpatients for each ward).",

Because there had been no prior documented risk factors for such outbreaks, univariate analysis was first conducted for each risk factor. Risk factors with P < .15 were included in a multiple logistic regression model and analyzed using the stepwise approach, with the inclusion/exclusion criterion of P < .15. This analysis was performed separately for the environmental or administrative factors and for host factors, because there were smaller usable numbers of case wards and control wards with information of host factors, which resulted from unidentified host patients in some case wards or from missing data.",

All risk factors selected in any of the separate multivariate models (P < .15) for environmental or administrative factors and for host factors were then included in a combined, final model, using the stepwise approach. Because the number of case wards was small and the number of risk factors examined was large, we had to group some individual risk factors in composite variables by counting or scoring (the number of positive responses in the group), recoding (any positive response in the group, which was coded as positive for the composite variable), or ranking (according to hierarchy) (table 1 and table 2) for the statistical analyses. Composite variables that were counted or ranked were rescaled from 0 to 1 to equalize their weights in the logistic models. A relatively large \u03b1 error of .15 was adopted in the analyses so as not to miss potentially important risk factors, because the number of case wards included in this study was small. The 95% CI of the OR was used to assess statistical significance at the conventional level of .05.",

We found that significant environmental risk factors associated with the occurrence of a superspreading event (clustering of \u22653 cases) included minimum distance between beds of \u22641 m and performance of resuscitation in the ward. Use of BIPAP ventilation and use of oxygen were the significant risk factors associated with the host patient. Of the administrative factors, allowing staff with symptoms to work also increased the risk. Providing adequate washing or changing facilities for staff was protective. Sensitivity testing by applying more stringent cutoff points (4 or 5 clustered cases) suggested that our results were quite robust, with 3 significant risk factors being identified consistently: minimum distance between beds of \u22641 m, staff working while experiencing symptoms, and host patient requiring oxygen therapy.",

The high flow-rate of oxygen or air and/or the positive pressure resulting from such treatment procedures might accentuate the spread of potentially infectious air exhaled or expelled from patients [20]. In our recent study of airflow around oxygen masks during oxygen therapy, exhaled air from the mask can travel up to 0.4 m on each side of the patient [29]. In the present study, both the use of oxygen therapy and BIPAP ventilation imposed a significant risk for nosocomial spread of SARS in the final combined model (cutoff value, 3 cases), and use of oxygen therapy also significantly increased the risk in models with higher cutoff values. We did not have enough details about oxygen therapy modalities given to the index patients to allow a more refined analysis regarding the types of masks or cannulae and flow rate of oxygen supply in this study. Proper capturing (enclosure, containment, and local exhaust) and filtering (high-efficiency particulate air filter) of exhaled or expelled air should be implemented if oxygen and BIPAP ventilation must be used for clinical reasons. The mechanical maneuvers and procedures associated with resuscitation can generate large amounts of aerosols that are potentially infectious, especially during intubation of the airway and manual ventilation. More thought should be given to redesigning the procedures by engineering or administrative means to achieve effective containment of any possible contamination arising from the resuscitation process [30].",

Because the study was confined to 2 cities in southern China, we are not sure if our results could be applied to other countries with different hospital practices. Nonetheless, we believe that our study has provided the best available evidence thus far on risk factors for superspreading events in the hospital setting. Another limitation might be that the interviews were conducted>1 year after the occurrence of the outbreaks of SARS, and recall inaccuracies might exist. However, we performed site inspections and physical measurements to obtain information on various physical and environmental risk factors and reviewed documents and staff rosters to complement and supplement recall and reporting by the ward managers. Therefore, information bias should have been substantially reduced. On the other hand, all host factors were abstracted from review of original medical records and should be objective. Another intrinsic weakness of the current study was the lack of statistical power because of the small number of case wards, especially in the subgroup analysis for Hong Kong. Thus, the contribution of certain possible risk factors (such as type of ventilation in the ward and lack of appropriate personal protective equipment and infection control training) could not be entirely ruled out. Certain factors that are intuitively important (e.g., presence of patient isolation or segregation and performance of mechanical ventilation or intubation among index or initial patients) unexpectedly did not have notable effects on univariate analyses. The true effects of these factors might have been subsumed by closely related risk factors that were statistically significant, such as resuscitation having been performed. The small number of study units prevents us from including these factors in multiple regression analyses that could have identified their independent effects. Perhaps a larger international collaboration would help solve this problem. All in all, the fairly consistent results of different subgroup analyses in Hong Kong and Guangzhou provide indirect support that our results are generally valid. Environmental or administrative factors were more important than host factors. Other than the presence of systemic symptoms (in analyses with more restrictive definitions for a superspreading event), the 2 host factors identified\u2014use of oxygen therapy and use of BIPAP ventilation\u2014pertained more to environmental contamination than to individual patient characteristics. In other words, this study managed to characterize the environment, rather than individual infected patients, during superspreading events.",

Nevertheless, the lessons learned from this study remain very important and highly relevant to the daily operation of hospital wards if we wish to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory infections in the future. With the current threat of avian influenza and other respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis, hospital wards have to be redesigned and managed in a manner to ensure that environmental factors associated with nosocomial infections are kept to the minimum. The importance of adequate spacing between beds and provision of washing or changing facilities for staff cannot be overemphasized. Staff with symptoms of respiratory infections should refrain from continuing their clinical duties. Adequate complementary protective devices at the source of infection (namely, infected patients) would have to be designed. Additional work needs to be conducted with regard to the safe use of oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support among patients with respiratory infections.",
