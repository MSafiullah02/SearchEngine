            "text": "The influenza A (H5N1) virus has been a focus of public health attention throughout the world since 2005. The H5N1 virus is primarily spread by migratory birds and mechanical means (e.g. from one farm to another on the soil captured by tractor tires). The virus can be transmitted from birds to mammals (including pigs, seals, whales, mink, ferrets, tigers, leopards, stone marten and domestic cats) and from birds to humans (Alexander, 2000; Hien et al., 2004; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006) . While avian influenza (bird flu) viruses were previously not known to infect humans the situation has changed with the recent occurrences of bird-to-human and human-to-human transmission, including an outbreak within an extended family living in a village in north Sumatra (Ungchusak et al., 2005) . Seven members of the extended family died after becoming infected with H5N1 (Wulandari and Lyn, 2006) . The initial WHO position was that '...an extended chain of human transmission was the most likely explanation' for the outbreak (Butler, 2006, p. 554) . However, in late June WHO concluded human-to-human transmission had occurred and that the virus detected in one of the children had mutated slightly meaning there are now at least two subtypes of the virus (Indianapolis Star, 2006; The Australian, 2006) .",

A Hong Kong study of 126 women aged 50-64 reported an increase in depressive symptoms and emotional distress during the SARS outbreak (Yu et al., 2005) . An analysis of calls to a SARS hotline in Hong Kong identified the need for gender-specific intervention planning, given evidence of the differential role of women in responding to the outbreak as a result of their gate-keeping and care-giving roles (Leung and Wong, 2005) . A study with people who had been quarantined during the SARS outbreak in Toronto, using individual semi-structured interviews, found that while reported compliance was high there was a significant variation between households (Cava et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "However, due to the emerging nature of avian influenza, there has been limited research on public knowledge and perceptions of this disease. A comprehensive search of academic databases and internet sites located two surveys conducted on a nationally representative sample of US residents: one prior to the conduct of this research, in January 2006, and one shortly after this study was conducted, in September 2006 (Blendon et al., 2006a; Blendon et al., 2006b ). The first survey (Blendon et al., 2006a) found that while 62% of the respondents were concerned about the possibility of an avian influenza pandemic and 57% were concerned that the pandemic could spread to the US, only 17% were very or somewhat worried about getting sick from it. The second survey (Blendon et al., 2006b) found that the public's estimation of the likelihood of a human case of avian influenza occurring in the US in the next 12 months had increased from 34 to 44%. Respondents in the first survey (Blendon et al., 2006a) were supportive of short-term quarantine for themselves if they had avian influenza (96%) and indicated they would wash their hands more frequently (90%), reduce or avoid travel (75%), avoid public events or gatherings (71%), stay at home during the outbreak (68%) and wear a face mask (52%) if a human avian influenza case occurred in the state in which they lived. This high level of support increased even further in the second survey (Blendon et al., 2006b) , with results indicating strong support for recommended public health measures. Thus, when asked if for a period of 1 month they would comply with the following measures most respondents indicated they would: avoid air travel (93%), avoid public events (92%), avoid going to malls and department stores (91%), limit use of public transportation (89%) and reduce contact with people outside the household (88%). In addition, 90% stated they were very or somewhat likely to stay in their town or city if such an action were recommended by public health officials.",

Thus, as Grier and Bryant (2005) remind us, we must offer benefits the consumer values, recognise both tangible and intangible costs, and ensure that all parties receive benefits in exchange for their efforts. Thus, in the context of a potential avian influenza pandemic, we must ensure that consumers perceive value in reducing the risk of transmission, recognise the financial, social and effort costs of behaviour change and ensure intermediaries are appropriately reimbursed for their efforts.",

This involves dividing the market into segments, evaluating each segment and selecting target segment(s) and then developing a marketing mix for those segments that takes into consideration their specific benefits and costs, competing options and most appropriate distribution channels (Maibach, 2003) . For example, in our recent research into adolescent sun protection behaviour (Lynch et al., 2007) , we identified key psychographic segments that had fundamentally different motives for (not) engaging in sun protection-including a segment that attempted to sun protect but forgot to reapply sunscreen (thus best targeted by reminder messages) and a segment that did not sun protect because it was too much effort (thus best targeted by self-efficacy messages and product modifications).",

This is a critical note of differentiation, and highlights the lack of urgency or panic associated with bird flu. If bird flu is caught rather than spread, then bird flu can be prevented by avoiding direct contact with the contagion, and thus has far less devastating impact. To catch a disease suggests the unfortunate situation of an individual being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In contrast, to have a disease spread, suggests mass contamination, indiscriminately affecting large numbers of people. We note that the use of the term 'caught' versus 'spread' was not a conscious act by participants, but provides an insight into the current state of play in the mind of the public. The single most common belief as to how one catches bird flu is that it is caught through the consumption of a diseased bird (thus placing it in the category of diseases such as BSE, which could be prevented by not eating beef, rather than diseases such as SARS). Also of interest is the finding that many believe that even this limited mode of infection can be prevented by thorough cooking of the offending bird. This is consistent with a recent study in Hanoi which found that consumers associated the risk of bird flu with the consumption of poultry (Figuie and Fournier, 2008) , with 74% stopping eating poultry in January 2004 (but resuming consumption when perceived risk declined).",

Australians who, unlike those in countries such as Canada and Singapore, were not exposed to SARS), bird flu is expected to pass by without impacting on Australia. Further, the perceived reduction in media coverage over the last few months supports the belief that this was just another example of the media exaggerating a disease risk.
