However, although renin was first described in 1898 and angiotensin in 1936, investigators continue to discover new facets of the RAS. The role of the monocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in physiology and pathophysiology has attracted increasing interest. While ACE converts the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II by removing the two distal amino acids, ACE2 can act on both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. In both situations, it removes the most distal amino acid, leading to production of angiotensin-(1\u20139) (Ang-1\u20139) and angiotensin-(1\u20137) (Ang-1\u20137), respectively. Ang-1\u20139 is then further metabolized by ACE to give Ang-1\u20137. Although ACE2 shares approximately 40% homology with the classic ACE, it is the product of a separate gene and is under separate regulatory control.1 Importantly, ACE inhibitors in clinical practice do not inhibit ACE2.",

Mice with global ACE2 deletion have increased responsiveness to RAS activation.2 Maternal ACE2 deficiency leads to fetal growth restriction, possibly secondary to increased placental concentrations of angiotensin II.3 ACE2 has also been implicated in regulation of oxidative stress in the paraventricular nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, which may modulate sympathetic tone and blood pressure. Although in a manner that is not related to its role in regulation of the RAS, ACE2 serves as the receptor in the lung for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and ACE2-deficient mice do not develop lung injury upon exposure to the virus.4\n",

On the one hand, by conversion of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II to Ang-1\u20137, ACE2 modulates the amount of angiotensin II that is available to activate angiotensin II type 1 receptors, while on the other hand, Ang-1\u20137 is itself a ligand for the Mas receptor, activation of which has been reported to mediate vasodilation, natriuresis, and reductions in blood pressure.5 Depending on the tissue and the pathophysiologic condition, one or the other of these mechanisms may predominate, or they may work in concert. In any event, abnormalities in ACE2 expression and/or activity have now been implicated in a range of disorders, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetic nephropathy.",

The mice were on the FVB/n background, which is relatively sensitive to development of diabetic nephropathy, and when these mice were rendered diabetic by streptozotocin administration, the selective ACE2 overexpression in the podocytes delayed the onset of severe functional and structural glomerular changes. Specifically, there was a delay in the onset of significant albuminuria, a delay in development of significant mesangial expansion, a partial preservation of podocyte number, a delay in increases in glomerular expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and preservation of expression of the podocyte markers nephrin and synaptopodin. Notably, these changes were not accompanied by any detectable differences in blood pressure between wild-type and transgenic diabetic mice, suggesting that the observed beneficial effects were due to direct, local effects at the glomerulus.",

Is this effect only due to relative inhibition of local podocyte angiotensin II production and angiotensin II type 1 receptor activation? If so, one might expect that with administration of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, there might not be any additional benefit seen in the transgenic mice. Conversely, if increased Ang-1\u20137 underlies the observed beneficial effects of podocyte overexpression of ACE2, what is its site of action, as there is no evidence to date that podocytes express Mas? In this regard, this group has previously described that cultured mesangial cells do express Mas and respond to Ang-1\u20137.16 Other questions include the site of production and role of altered TGF-\u03b2 in the ACE2 effects, especially since the aforementioned study in mesangial cells indicated that Ang-1\u20137 actually stimulated TGF-\u03b2 production rather than inhibiting it. In a previous study by this group in a 5/6 nephrectomy mouse model, ACE2 inhibition worsened proteinuria, while administration of Ang-1-7 had no effect and actually increased mesangial expansion.17\n",

Therefore, modulation of the ACE2 pathway represents a potentially exciting target for therapeutic intervention. Further studies to unravel the mechanisms underlying this protection will be required in order to determine whether increasing ACE2 activity or activating Ang-1-7-mediated signaling pathways will be the most successful mode of intervention (Figure 1).",
