This effect follows from the participation of this bond in the HB interactions. The X-ray studies also postulate the existence of weak CeH/O contacts between the N-oxide as acceptors and the H atoms of the pyridine and the methyl groups as donors. However, the IR and Raman spectra as well as the quantum chemical calculations do not confirm the presence of such interactions. 3. The quantum-chemical calculations conducted for isolated MA3MPO molecules locate the lowest singlet state assigned to the n / p* (CT) transitions overlapped with some contribution of the p / p* intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).
