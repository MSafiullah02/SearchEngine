During 2002, active surveillance for hospitalized pneumonia was established in Sa Kaeo province by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) International Emerging Infections Program, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), and the Sa Kaeo Public Health Office; in August 2003, a study to determine the etiology of pneumonia began. All 8 hospitals in the province, accounting for all acute-care hospitalizations, participated [13]. In general, a patient was enrolled in the study if he or she had at least 1 sign of acute infection (fever, chills, temperature <35.5\u00b0C, abnormal white blood cell [WBC] count or differential [>11,000 or <3000 cells/\u03bcL]) plus signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease (abnormal breath sounds, tachypnea, cough, sputum production, or dyspnea) and the physician ordered a chest radiograph (CXR) within 48 h of admission. Each enrolled patient provided a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, acute and convalescent serum, urine, and clinical and demographic information. In addition, a sample of outpatients with acute influenza-like illness was recruited from the outpatient departments of 5 hospitals in Sa Kaeo province [14]. Influenza-like illness was defined by the World Health Organization definition (fever within the preceding 3 days and cough or sore throat in the absence of other diagnoses). Each outpatient participant provided a NP swab and demographic information.",

Respiratory specimens and select serum specimens were tested for HBoV by real-time PCR assays that targeted the HBoV NS1 and NP-1 genes [12].We defined an HBoV infection as a positive PCR test for both the NS1 and NP-1 targets or a positive test for a single target that was confirmed with a second extraction from a new, previously unopened sample aliquot. Semiquantitative estimates of virus load in clinical samples expressed as genome equivalents (GEs) per milliliter of viral transport media were determined by comparison of sample cycle threshold value with those obtained from standard curves prepared from serial 10-fold dilutions of HBoV recombinant plasmids for each real-time PCR target [12].",

The proportion of patients with pneumonia in each age group was 24%, 9%, 9%, 25%, and 34%, respectively; the proportion of control patients was 18%, 11%, 22%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. Our analysis was limited to 1 September 2004\u201331 August 2005. We assessed risk factors for HBoV infection among hospitalized patients with pneumonia using an unconditional logistic regression model that included all potential confounders and variables in the model that were significant at the univariate level at P < .05. All 2-way interactions were evaluated. To estimate the minimum age group\u2014specific incidence of HBoV-associated pneumonia requiring hospitalization, we divided the number of HBoV infections by the appropriate age-group population estimate from the 2000 national Thai census of Sa Kaeo Province. Each pneumonia admission was counted individually, including readmissions \u2a7e14 days since a previous discharge. Readmissions within \u2a7d13 days were considered to be 1 admission. Clinical characteristics that were obtained from patients with pneumonia associated with HBoV infection with RSV, HPIV 1\u20133, or rhinovirus infection, but no coinfection with any of the other viruses, were compared with patients with HBoV-RSV and HBoV-HPIV coinfection or with HBoV-rhinovirus coinfection. RSV- and HPIV-associated pneumonias were combined to increase the numbers available for comparison. Variables were compared using the \u03c72 test for dichotomous variables or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables. Two-tailed P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Patients with missing values for clinical characteristics were excluded from the comparison of clinical characteristics, and patients with triple virus infections were excluded from clinical comparisons and logistic regression models. All analysis was performed by use of SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute).",

Among patients with pneumonia, 51 were readmissions. In addition, we enrolled a sample of 512 outpatients with upper respiratory tract illness and 280 control patients without fever or respiratory illness. One outpatient did not have enough specimen to test for HBoV and was excluded. NP swab specimens from all participants were tested for HBoV (table 1). As reported elsewhere [12], HBoV infection was detected in 4.5% of patients with pneumonia. Most infections were detected among patients with pneumonia who were <5 years old; 13% were among infants <1 year old, and 70% were among children 1\u20134 years old. Few HBoV infections were found among young or middle-aged adults; 4% were among persons \u2a7e65 years old. By contrast, only 1% of control patients had HBoV infection. HBoV infection was detected in 20 (3.9%) of 512 outpatients with influenza-like illness; 70% were among children <5 years old. Among HBoVpositive specimens, the estimated virus load ranged from 600 to 4\u00d71010 GE/mL. As noted elsewhere [12], most of the positive hospitalized patients and all of the control patients had moderate to low virus loads (<5\u00d7104 GE/mL).

Age was the greatest risk factor for HBoV infection, with younger children, <1 year old (AOR, 6.45 [95% CI, 1.08\u201338.51]) and 2\u20134 years old (AOR, 15.13 [95% CI, 3.42\u201366.82]), having the highest risk of infection, compared with patients 5\u201319 years old (AOR, 4.23 [95% CI, 0.74\u201323.94]), 20\u2013 49 years old (AOR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.18\u20139.56]), 50\u201364 years old (AOR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.10\u201311.91]), and \u2a7e65 years old (referent).

Because HBoV infection was uncommon among our sample of persons without fever or signs and symptoms of respiratory illness, it seems unlikely that HBoV infection in patients with pneumonia was a coincidental event and not linked to their illness. However, the role that HBoV infection plays in the disease process is confounded by the high proportion of coinfections with other respiratory viruses.We tested for a greater number of viruses than has been reported in other published studies, and we found a much higher proportion of viral coinfections\u2014among children <5 years old, the proportion of HBoV infections with viral coinfections was 91%. In addition, the burden of HBoV-associated pneumonia was substantial. Our population-based estimates of the incidence of HBoV-associated pneumonia place it among such viruses as RSV and influenza, which cause significant morbidity among young children. Finally, our findings suggest that HBoV infection, or coinfection, may influence a patient's clinical presentation.",

            "text": "The apparent dependency of HBoV infection and illness on coinfection with other respiratory viruses is intriguing. Parvoviruses are among the most dependent on host cellular functions for replication, and they only multiply in cells that are in the process of replicating their own DNA [17]. Human parvovirus B19, an Erythrovirus, only replicates during the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Adeno-associated viruses in the genus Dependovirus depend on coinfection with adenovirus or herpesviruses that induce DNA synthesis in the host cell to facilitate their own replication. However, the other members of the genus Bocavirus\u2014bovine bocavirus and canine minute virus\u2014do not require a helper virus, and most of the HBoV coinfecting viruses that we identified do not induce DNA replication in the host cell. One possibility is that coviral-induced cellular damage results in high levels of cellular division and differentiation, creating conditions permissive for HBoV replication. A similar mechanism has been shown for polyomavirus infection in mice [18]. In addition, respiratory viral infections may suppress immune system functions to make the host more susceptible to infection with HBoV. Further studies are needed to understand the interaction between HBoV and other viral infections.",

Children with viral respiratory infections often present with wheezing [19]. Although we did not have a large sample of patients with only HBoV infection, our results raise the possibility that HBoV coinfection may play an important role in the clinical presentation of wheezing among children. Also, several studies have documented an association with respiratory viral infections and exacerbations of asthma in adults and children [20\u201322]. Confirmation of our results with other patient cohorts and obtaining additional information on underlying illness, such as a history of asthma, will be important to more fully understand the role of HBoV infection and human disease.",

We did not find evidence of viremia in samples from patients with low HBoV respiratory titers or those infected with other respiratory viruses. Therefore, this phenomenon may not be common. Interestingly, HBoV nucleic acid was present in convalescent serum specimens from 2 of the patients with HBoV positive acute serum. Persistent viremia of another parvovirus causing human illness, parvovirus B19, has been described [23]. One study also reported finding HBoV nucleic acid in respiratory tissues and one bowel-tissue specimen from autopsy specimens from 9 children [24]. Therefore, it is possible that this recently described virus does cause viremia and possibly even illness other than that of the respiratory tract. Persistent HBoV viremia could have implications for blood- or organ-donation programs. Tissue-culture techniques for growing HBoV that could establish HBoV viability in serum specimens have not yet been described.",

In contrast to most studies to date, which reported HBoV in a convenience sample of patients submitting respiratory specimens, the present study was built on an ongoing, prospective, population-based, surveillance system, and it included a control group without respiratory disease, which allowed us to estimate incidence and burden of disease and to determine epidemiologically whether HBoV infection was associated with hospitalized pneumonia. However, the number and rate of cases of HBoV-associated pneumonia were likely underestimated. Only 58% of patients admitted to a Sa Kaeo hospital during the study period with signs and symptoms of clinical pneumonia got a CXR, and only 51% of these enrolled in the etiology study did so. We found a high proportion of HBoV infections that had coinfection with other viruses. However, although we tested for more viruses than other studies, we may have missed additional viral infections not detected by PCR or tissue culture. The PCR primers for viral diagnostics were based on published sequences. Therefore, viral variants that are not recognized by our primers or identified by our culture techniques will have been missed. During the study year, diagnostic testing for bacterial pathogens was limited to urine pneumococcal surface antigen assay among patients with pneumonia who were >18 years old. No adults had HBoV\u2014 Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection.

In addition, HBoV coinfection may influence the clinical symptoms that the patient displays.
