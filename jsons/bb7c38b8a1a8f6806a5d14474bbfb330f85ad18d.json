            "text": "The Introduction sketched the origins and elements of human security. This chapter lays out one argument to make the case that citizens' human rights are the responsibility of the corresponding State, meaning that citizens of a territorial State claim particular rights that State is obliged to deliver. As outlined in the Introduction, these rights have been expanded to encompass not only physical protection within a territory but also a host of economic and welfare provisions (H\u00f6sle 2003; Slaughter 2004; CESCR 1966; ICPCR 1966) . However, especially with regard to the latter, not all of these rights are equally or legally encoded into national law. Thus despite the increasingly international discourse on human security rights, their legal home remains with the national State vis-\u00e0-vis its citizens. In return, in an aspect which is often neglected in analyses of human security, citizens also owe allegiance to the State. 1 This includes submitting to civic codes such as police ordinances and taxation, as well as to the military draft when instituted 2 : without such a reciprocal relationship between States and citizens, it might not be possible to guarantee territorial or other human security protections. Of course, the necessary existence of such a relationship does not preclude its potential for abuse by either party (see also Howell 2014) . This reciprocal relationship is based on a State-citizenship centric order, and that not only at the national level, but also internationally. In other words, citizenship here is dependent upon its conferral by a territorial State, which derives its contours from its citizenry.",

This has led to a diffusion of the guarantor status of the national State, with elements of power in governance-agency, scope, mechanisms, and normative context-diverging. This leads to two questions: first, if State A acts as a guarantor to the human security of citizens of A, the same holds for State B and citizens of B; but what happens to citizens of State A residing in State B, or vice versa? Second, what are the consequences of human security provision to citizens of A or B by NSAs, notably when NSAs go bankrupt or depart? Both of these questions point again to the need to clarify the relationship between citizens and States in order to conceive of suitable answers.",

            "text": "As outlined in the Introduction, the idea of human security as the remit of the State is inextricable from the notion of State sovereignty. Sovereignty as a concept has been debated since its inception, and each idea of it has made various assumptions as to what it entails and what it excludes. The majority of scholars (Krasner 1999) of Westphalia-influenced definitions of sovereignty include requisites such as the State enjoying a monopoly of power capable of defending its territorial borders against external aggression; even these have rarely been absolute in practice (Krasner 1999, 8-9, 42) . In describing this 'compound' myth, Anne-Marie Slaughter defines Westphalian sovereignty as \"the right to be left alone, to exclude, to be free from any external meddling or interference\" (Slaughter 2004, 284 ). Yet the same sovereignty that offers the option to opt out is also the ticket to inclusion in the inter-national community of (equal) States. The Westphalian definition also invokes \"the right to be recognized as an autonomous agent in the international system, capable of interaction with other States and entering into international agreements\" (Slaughter 2004, 284) , the responsibility for whose implementation resides squarely with those signatory States. This reveals the schism between what Robert Keohane (1995) called formal and 'operational' sovereignty, and what I referred to as the divergent 'final guarantee' and 'functional' sovereignty with regard to the governance accountability problem (GAP) (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2014). It acknowledges that Westphalian sovereignty is not absolute, and rather that \"it is now a platitude that the ability of governments to attain their objectives through individual action has been undermined by international political and economic interdependence\" (Keohane, quoted in Slaughter 2004, 283) . The EU exemplifies political and economic interdependence, a model partially replicated to differing degrees by the African Union (AU), ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), and MERCOSUR (the common market of select South American States) in a quest to confront threats and maximize opportunities. Both in theory and in practice then, this means that, on the one hand, States increasingly cannot-and often do not want to-fully guard against external interference. On the other hand, States (should also) acknowledge that the sources of such interference include not only other States but also activities of NSAs, from crime syndicates and cyber surveillance and mercenaries to human rights' campaigners, as well as cross-border challenges such as (infectious) disease spread and migration. These interdependencies and their potential both for cooperation and for conflict directly influence a State's ability not only to control its own territory (see Krasner, interdependence sovereignty, pages 12-14) but also to the \"security, economic stability and a measure of prosperity, clean air and water, and even minimum health standards\" (Slaughter 2004, 283) that are the hallmarks of H\u00f6sle's expanded definition of sovereignty (H\u00f6sle 2003) and the integral components of human security.",

            "text": "Human security's main argument places the emphasis of security on the human as opposed to the State. The central assumption underscoring human security is that \"when a human faces a threat, so does international security\" (Burgess and Gr\u00e4ns 2012, 101; Kerr 2007, 92; UNDP 1994 ). Yet the two are necessarily in dialogue with each other: first of all, States in the inter-national remain the arbiters of human security (H\u00f6sle 2003; UN Declaration 1948; UNDP 1994) , regardless of whether the point of departure is human-or State-centric; and second, as members of the international community of (equal) States, these are themselves increasingly subjected to trial by their peers. \"States can no longer assume that if they refrain from interfering in the affairs of other states they will remain free from interference themselves\" (Slaughter 2004, 284) . Furthermore, Governments increasingly understand that they often cannot afford to look the other way; that fundamental threats to their own security, whether from refugees, terrorists, the potential destabilization of an entire region, or a miasma of disease and crime, may well have their origins in conditions once thought to be within a state's exclusive domestic jurisdiction. (Slaughter 2004, 284) As the post-Cold War era has shown, both intra-and inter-State conflict have coincided with the spread of disease. This has been evident in the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda and Somalia, in Iraq and Syria (Intrastate Conflict by the Numbers 2013; Human Security Centre). These conflicts have seen the increase in cross-border spread of disease such as EVD, H5N1, HIV, measles (notably in continental Europe, and the US), MERS-CoV, and SARS, to name a few examples. This incidence salience of the insight that: \"States can only govern effectively by actively cooperating with other states and by collectively reserving the power to intervene in other states' affairs\" (Slaughter 2004, 285) . It has been backed up by the normative evolutions first from rights to responsibility, to the R2P, to, arguably at this moment, the responsibility to respond.",

Therein, \"internally, a government has a responsibility to respect the dignity and basic rights of its citizens,\" and \"externally, it has a responsibility to respect the sovereignty of other states\" (Slaughter 2004, 287) , except when a State heeds the (r)evolution rewriting sovereignty as control to sovereignty as responsibility. Daniel Philpott describes this shift as part of an ongoing process. He attributes this revolution in sovereignty to \"prior revolutions in ideas about justice and political authority\" (Philpott 2001, 4) . The post-Cold War reordering of the world proffers a multitude of examples of this progress: from emergent multipolarity (Flockhart 2016) to the rise of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and NSAs, from the human rights debates to gain access to HIV treatment to those to usher in the R2P (ICISS 2001), reconceptualizations of internal and external State responsibility have been pitted against each other. Though the State remains legally dominant, theoretical and philosophical evidence underscored by empirics points to two key unresolved tensions: the locus of the responsibility for human security and the scope of human security, particularly in reaching non-citizens.",

Rosenau introduced the idea of 'governance without government' (Rosenau and Czempiel 1992), maintaining that governance 'regimes' composed both of States and NSAs would form to tackle specific issues in the international realm. NSAs have long been engaged in shoring up or tearing down State sovereignty, with (H\u00f6sle 2003) or without the consent of the State. While on the one hand a tension exists between theory and practice of State sovereign obligation with regard to human security, it also means that though threats to human security abound on the part of both State and NSAs, precedents likewise exist for mitigating these to the benefit of human security. To a large extent, Rosenau has been proven correct: if NSAs are included, then a plethora of organizations exist dedicated to treating HIV/AIDS, providing water and sanitation, and even administering public transportation in municipalities around the world. However, these are not regimes in the sense that they have a central organizational structure, that their interventions are legally binding, or that any mechanisms are in place to ensure the continuation of their work if and when they opt out. This is not a central theme of Risse's work, which focuses on 'areas of limited statehood' (Risse 2007) . Here NSAs might perform functions theoretically if not in practice associated with State responsibility for human security. Yet they are not bound to such actions, for instance, of service delivery and health care. Critically, instead of shoring up States' lack of capacity, NSAs have contributed to the fragmentation of their power-including their ability to guarantee traditional and human security:",

Centre for Human Rights, in 1993 . \"This is clearly ridiculous.\" Today NGOs deliver more official development assistance than the entire U.N. system (excluding the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund). In many countries they are delivering the services-in urban and rural community development, education, and health care-that faltering governments can no longer manage. (Matthews 1997) Nonetheless, Risse assumes that NSAs will continue their activities. That these NSAs might be accountable not to the human beings they serve, but otherwise, or that they might be dependent upon funding sources whose priorities are prone to shift, remains under-analyzed. It leaves unanswered the questions of what happens to the State-citizen relationship when they do not.",

This meant on the one hand that especially newly minted States could cling in particular to the Westphalian notions of 'nonintervention,' a stance reemphasized by both blocs at the height of the Cold War. On the other hand, however, the existence of the post-World War II UN and its emerging norms and values spread the notion that State responsibility includes human rights discourse if not its translation into practice. This pre-exposure arguably paved the way for the 1990s shift, which, in the words of the independent Commission on Human Security, refers to the 'vital freedom,' explicitly tied State responsibility to \"protecting people from severe and pervasive threats, both national and societal, and empowering individuals and community to develop the capabilities for making informed choices and acting on their own behalf\" (Ogata and Cels 2003, 274) .

From the very beginning of the post-World War II period, Article 1 of the UN Charter and Article 25 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) encoded the principles of human security, including an emphasis on the right to health, which is central to the case studies presented in Chaps. 5 and 6: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care \u2026 and the right to security in the event of \u2026 sickness, [and] disability \u2026 Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.

In fact, the IHR, having gone into effect in 2007, require their 196 signatory State parties to \"develop public health capacities to detect and respond to public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), with States required to cooperate in building these capacities\" (WHO 2008) . \"However, the regulations do not provide incentives, sanction states for failing to cooperate, or allocate responsibility\" (Gostin and Friedman 2014, 1323) . No specific or enforceable obligation to ensure that individuals attain physical and mental health and no guidelines for how the State's obligations are to be discharged exist (Davies 2010) . This situation obviously creates problems for the implementation of the right to health within the remit of a State's responsibility to provide (human) security. Nonetheless, these agreements have transformed normative ideas into principles of action (ICESCR 1966, Article 12 ). Yet real implementation lags, lost in the opaque realm between theoretical and practical responsibility. The consequences are particularly obvious with regard to States' responses to threats to human security of, but not only of, health.",

Kaldor et al. (2007) attempt to work this into an especially value-based foreign policy strategy for the EU that nonetheless takes State interests into account. This morphs into the broader conceptualization of human security, wherein an equal level of priority is given to any type of threat (Thakur 2004, 37) . Critics argue that such prioritization of all is equal to prioritization of none. Liotta and Owens present one attempt to differentiate between threats, risks, and vulnerabilities as part of this debate (Liotta and Owens 2006) . They arguably all converge and infringe upon human security which demands a response. A gap emerges between theory of protecting human security and its practice.",

The (inter)national system based on sovereign States continues to operate under the assumption that \"governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures\" (WHO 1948) . Critically, \"while only States are parties to the Covenant, and thus ultimately accountable for compliance with it, all members of society-individuals, including health professionals, families, local communities, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations as well as the private business sectorhave responsibilities regarding the realisation of the right to health\" (WHO, IHR 2005) . As Lake notes with regard to judicial processes in the Congo, \"The de facto assumption of power by these diverse sets of actors has created opportunities through which non-State actors can enter and influence juridical processes by engaging in tasks normally reserved for representatives of the sovereign government. These activities would not be possible in contexts where the State had greater reach\" (Lake 2014, 519) . This exacerbates the problem of responsibility because merely counting the number of convictions of a prioritized crime or the number of people inquiring about health treatments and antiretroviral medications for HIV, for example, \"tells us little about the dynamics of power\" that determine the necessary response to the problem (including the problem definition) at hand (Lake 2014, 523) . Lake notes that \"on a broader scale, it could also be argued that the involvement of international actors in micro-level governance activities in DR [Democratic Republic of] Congo has served not to build capacity but in fact to further relieve the Congolese state of its responsibilities to provide basic goods and services to its citizens.\" Indeed, because a litany of \"international and domestic organizations ready to engage in this work, there may be little incentive for the central government to re-invest its own time and resources into developing a functional state apparatus\" (see also Keohane 1995; Lake 2014, 524) .",

It was invoked to prevent and delay sharing data and sam-ples of H1N1 influenza also due to the anticipated costs of being branded a State of contagion amid exclusion from research and treatment benefits. Indonesia's was an ill-fated attempt by the State to seize control over information pertaining to the outbreak, its domestic response, and its interdependence sovereignty-notably its ability to regulate any potential medical interventions and possible patents created externally and sold (back) to Indonesia. These examples all iterate the theory and practical reality in the still State-centric international system that There are roles that only the state-at least among today's polities-can perform. States are the only nonvoluntary political unit, the one that can impose order and is invested with the power to tax\u2026. Moreover, it may be that only the nation-state can meet crucial social needs that markets do not value. Providing a modicum of job security, avoiding higher unemployment, preserving a livable environment and a stable climate, and protecting consumer health and safety are but a few of the tasks that could be left dangling in a world of expanding markets and retreating states.

Although State sovereignty continues to be the building block of local, national, and international relations and global governance, its real power to enact responsibilities and assume accountability for the provision of the rights of its citizens has arguably waned-not uniformly but almost regardless of whether the State in question is considered consolidated, fragile, or failing/failed. Consequently, the ostensibly sovereign State is ultimately responsible for the traditional, territorial security and physical security of the populace within its borders. In addition, it is accountable for both of these securitizations both internally and externally (i.e., within the international community of States). However, the same State is increasingly confronted with NSAs that both demand its action and assume some of its functional responsibility-but not State(-citizen) accountability. As such, the Statecentric international governance system faces the challenge of responding to both internal and external rights' demands and responsibility duties. The next chapter will further explore these conceptual challenges and analyze possible levels of such a reordering of human security responsibilities beyond borders.",
