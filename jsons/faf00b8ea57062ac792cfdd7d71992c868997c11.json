Here, we study a practical realization of the three-player dilemma game using the superconductivity-based quantum processors provided by IBM Q Experience. We analyze the persistence of the quantum advantage under corruption of the input states and how this depends on parameters of the payoff table. Specifically, experimental fidelity and error are observed not to be properly anti-correlated, i.e., there are instances where a class of experiments with higher fidelity yields a greater error in the payoff. Further, we find that the classical strategy will always outperform the quantum strategy if corruption is higher than half. *",

Therefore, it plays an important role in the fields of computer science, economics, biology, psychology, etc. (see [1, 2] for review). Computationally, game theory can be used to model algorithms [3, 4] as well as check the robustness of networks and corresponding attack strategies [5] . In cryptography, the communication task can be visualized as a game between the parties trying to communicate securely and an eavesdropper ( [6] and references therein). With the advent of quantum computing, it is observed that resources used in quantum computing, such as quantum coherence and entanglement, provide alternative solutions to classical games.",

Specifically, as all the players wish to maximize their gain or payoff in games, for which the umpire has laid down the rule(s), players using quantum mechanical tactics are found to attain a higher payoff compared to the classical one [9] . Further, the dilemma disappears in prisoner's dilemma with the use of quantum resources under unitary operations [10, 11] . Along the same line, optimal cloning of quantum states is also studied as game [12] . Quantum games based on monogamy of entanglement are shown to be useful in device independent quantum cryptography [13] . Our understanding of several other foundational aspects of quantum mechanics is improved by considering games, such as nonlocality [14] , the uncertainty bound on nonlocality [15] , contextuality [16] , PR-boxes [17] , as well as applications in quantum reinforcement learning [18] and quantum machine learning [19] .",

It has been suggested that these quantum games may shed light on the interactions in many-particle systems [21] . One such multiplayer game is the three-party counterpart of the prisoner's dilemma. In the classical version, all three players prefer to choose analogous to the corresponding two-party case. The dilemma exists because the Nash equilibrium does not coincide with the Pareto optimal [20] . Specifically, a Nash equilibrium is the situation in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy, while Pareto optimal corresponds to the situation that any change in strategy would make at least one individual worse off [20] . Still in quantum case, use of tripartite entanglement shows certain advantage. Moreover, computing the Nash equilibrium in the three-and four-player games is shown to be a hard problem [22, 23] . An experimental verification of three-player dilemma game using NMR was reported in Ref. [24] . In the recent past, other games have been realized on photonic quantum computer [25] [26] [27] [28] and ion trap platform [29] .",

Independently, the effect of errors in the initial state preparation (as corruption by a demon) on the outcome of three-player dilemma game is studied assuming that the players are unaware of corruption and that there is no decoherence [21] . Interestingly, beyond a pivotal value of corruption it can be observed that players fare off better with the classical strategies, but since players have no knowledge of the level of corruption they have to stick to their original strategies. Furthermore, a quantum game reduces to classical game if one of the parties allows his qubit to decohere under Markovian noise channels [35] , while Nash equilibria are unchanged by decoherence for prisoner's dilemma [36] .",

Interestingly, this is the first realization of a game with corrupt source on a superconducting qubits based quantum computer. Despite high error rate and the limited qubit connectivity, it has been shown to run a wide array of algorithms ( [38, 39] and references therein). Thus, we realize the game on IBM Q Experience and compare the experimental payoffs with previous experiments on NMR [24] . On generalizing the payoff table in the noisy game, the point where quantum advantage disappears also changes which leads to some interesting observations. In specific, they show how robust the quantum strategy is. An application of these results is that given a known corruption level, the payoff table (the relative stakes) may, in a range, be chosen to give an advantage to the quantum strategy. Finally, we show that classical strategies dominate when corruption is higher than 50% in the proposed game.",

However, if one person decides to go then the other two will be unhappy (with payoff \u2212n), and the one attending the party does not enjoy being alone (with payoff p). When two of the friends decide to go they both fare off with n payoff each since they get to go to the party with company, while the friend left behind is not too dejected since his presence would have overcrowded the party so he gets p. If all of them decide to go, they get payoff of q each since their presence has overcrowded the party. Accordingly, we impose n > q > p > 0. This problem is also relevant in the recent pandemic coronavirus situation that may allow a restaurant to open but to avoid infection it restricts people who can sit at a table to two, say because the table is 1 m wide and only two persons can sit in the same table opposite to each other without violating the social distancing norms. Yet another example for the three-player dilemma closer to most of us would be the dilemma of three academic collaborators in applying for a research grant. If two of them apply, they are likely to receive the grant, whereas they probably would receive insufficient or no funding if all three apply for it. Also, they would not be happy if none of them apply or their collaborator gets it but not them. The dilemma shown previously was by considering n = 9, p = 1, and q = 2 [20] . Here, we study a general description of such payoff tables and show how the payoff depends on these parameters in the noisy game (subjected to constraint 0 < p < q < n). One motivation for this is to understand whether and how the game's stakes can be fixed based on knowledge of the preparation noise in the system. In [20] , it is shown that in a special case considering a different set of values of the payoffs, quantum players do not have any advantage over the classical strategy which is no longer a Nash equilibrium. Therefore, we have restricted ourselves to the aforementioned constraint which ensures that classical Nash equilibrium exists. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generalize the payoff table for the three-player dilemma game in analogy of prisoner's dilemma [40] .",

Of course, a reduction in noise with improvement in technology will improve the outcome.

Further, it can be observed that due to additional errors (other than source error introduced in the noisy counterpart of the game) the advantage of quantum game over corresponding classical game disappears quickly. Similar studies for the generalizations of other games where quantum players perform better or the games where classical strategies are always preferable can be performed to study the role of various payoff parameters in those cases. The present experimental implementation of the noisy quantum game on a small noisy quantum computer establishes a practical quantum advantage in game theory. However, in view of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology [45] around the corner, i.e., quantum computing infrastructure with 50-100 qubits, this advantage can be exploited for several applications, such as in quantum machine learning [46] . This can be further extended to the iterated version of the game where it is performed more than once, and rational players decide their strategies depending upon their opponents' previous decision. The results from the experiment performed on NMR was more accurate, showing that the NMR-based quantum computer is less noisy. To obtain a quantitative perception of that we performed quantum state tomography here, which shows that higher fidelity of experimentally generated state does not necessarily mean smaller errors, i.e., fidelity and errors are not properly anti-correlated.",

For example, measurement-deviceindependent and device-independent as well as entangled state based quantum key distribution schemes, such as Ekert's scheme [53] , can be viewed as a three-party game involving Alice, Bob and Eve. A future work is planned to rigorously analyze the best strategy of Alice and Bob and that of Eve using a game theoretic approach.
