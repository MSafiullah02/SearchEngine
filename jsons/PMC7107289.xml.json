IBV is an enveloped virus of approximately 27.6 kb in length. The IBV S1 segment of the spike protein is a major inducer of serum antibodies and is closely associated with viral tissue tropism and immune protection (Xu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Typical symptoms of IBV infection include mouth breathing, head twitches, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge (Cavanagh, 2007; Yan et al., 2017). Despite a predilection for the respiratory tract, IBV infection also displays kidney and oviduct tropisms, causing urogenital symptoms and secondary bacterial infections (Naqi et al., 2003; Zhong et al., 2016).",

The Massachusetts serotype was believed to be the only serotype until a second serotype (Connecticut) was identified in the mid-1950s (Keeler et al., 1998). The inaccuracy of the coronaviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and high frequency of genetic changes during RNA replication (e.g., gene insertion, mutation, deletion, and reconstruction) promote the emergence of new variant IBV strains, which are continually reported (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Yan et al., 2016). Many IBV serotypes, antigenic variants, and field strains have been isolated in recent years (Xu et al., 2016). In addition, at least 30 IBV serotypes have been identified worldwide, and most available IBV vaccines cannot provide effective cross-protection against strains from different serotypes (Yan et al., 2016).",

IB outbreaks remain frequent, even among vaccinated flocks, which can be attributed to new IBV variants emerging in China. Therefore, continually isolating and identifying new IBV strains with pandemic potential, testing the pathogenicity of new isolates, and determining epidemics remain crucial for better understanding IBV epidemiology and controlling the disease. In this study, we examined 5 wild-type IBV strains from chicken farms in different areas in 2017 and 2018. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene were conducted to investigate the gene's molecular characteristics. An animal experiment was conducted to identify the pathogenicity of these IBVs to better understand the dominant IBV strains. The results of this study provide valuable insight into IBV evolution in China and demonstrate the need to improve vaccine efficacy against IBV infections.",

In this study, genotype and pathogenicity analyses of 5 new isolates (GDJ, GDS, LN1, LN2, and TJ) were conducted. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that the 5 new strains and many other field isolates were grouped in the QX-like genotype cluster in the S1 gene's phylogenetic tree and were distantly related to vaccine strains, which are considered the main agents for disease outbreaks (Liu et al., 2009). Our previous report indicates that Chinese IBV isolates are evolving at a rapid rate under the immune selection pressure of Mass-like vaccines and the S1 gene is the first structural gene to be affected by such selection pressure (Zhao et al., 2016). Thus, a specific vaccine must be developed to guard against potential QX-like viral threats on a molecular level.",

However, the 5 strains induced no high mortality, and their pathogenicities were lower than those described in previous reports (Yan et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Additionally, surviving chickens were humanely killed and dissected at the end of the observation period, and some chickens in the challenge-infection group showed tracheal hemorrhaging and hemorrhaging with heavy mucus exudate on their larynxes (Cheng et al., 2018). The ciliostasis test is often used to determine the degree of tracheal damage following IBV growth in this tissue (Tarpey et al., 2006). The results for the degree of ciliary movement in the tracheal epithelial cells at 7 dpc revealed that those IBV strains induced a severe respiratory disease and lesions in the experimental chickens, and the associated ciliostasis was severe, which reaffirmed that the trachea is the IBV\u2019s primary target organ (Zhao et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018).",

Coinfection of these IBVs with other pathogens is thought to have occurred in the chicks. A previous report found that coinfections with multiple respiratory pathogens are common in chickens (Sid et al., 2015). These primary pathogens include the avian influenza virus, IBV, Newcastle disease virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Haghighatjahromi et al., 2008; Stipkovits et al., 2012). Consequently, a secondary infection may be more easily acquired when the tracheal cilia's protective capability is weakened or lost. Although the mortality rates of all the IBV strains in this study were lower than those in previous isolates (Feng, et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2017), the virus contributes to a high mortality rate when it is coinfected with other pathogens in chickens (Haghighatjahromi et al., 2008).",
