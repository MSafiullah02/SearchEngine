The weekly diarrhoea cases crossed the threshold action line during week beginning 5 th September at the children's clinic in Rimuka Township, and the remaining four clinics reported cases crossing threshold action lines between week beginning 12 th September and week beginning 26 th September. Eighty-two percent of the cases were children less than 5 years old. We conducted a case controlstudy to determine risk factorsfor contracting watery diarrhoea in children less than 5 years in Kadoma City. Methods: An unmatched 1:1 case control study was conducted in Ngezi and Rimuka townships in Kadoma City, Zimbabwe. A case was a child less than 5 years old, who developed acute watery diarrhoea between 5 th September and 1 st October 2011. A control was a child less than 5 years old who stayed in the same township and did not suffer from diarrhoea. A structured questionnaire was administered to caregivers of cases and controls. Laboratory water quality tests and stool test results were reviewed.Epi Info\u2122 statistical software was used to analyse data. Results: A total of 109 cases and 109 controls were enrolled. Independent protective factors were: having been exclusively breastfed for six months [AOR = 0.44; 95% CI (0.24-0.82)]; using municipal water [AOR = 0.38; 95% CI (0.18-0.80)]; using aqua tablets, [AOR = 0.49; 95% CI (0.26-0.94)] and; storing water in closed containers, [AOR = 0.24; 95% CI (0.07-0.0.83). The only independent risk factor for contracting watery diarrhoea was hand washing in a single bowl, [AOR = 2.89; 95% CI (1.33-6.28)]. Salmonella, Shigella, Rotavirus, and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated in the stool specimens. None of the 33 municipal water samples tested showed contamination with Escherichia coli, whilst 23 of 44 (52%) shallow well water samples and 3 of 15(20%) borehole water samples tested were positive for Escherichia coli. Conclusions: The outbreak resulted from inadequate clean water and use of contaminated water. Evidence from this study was used to guide public health response to the outbreak.",

The water quality parameters tested were bacteriological and chemical (chlorine content for municipal water, and pH). Bacteriological water quality tests had been done using a Delagua field testing machine. Water samples that were found with zero colonies after incubation for 24 hours were considered satisfactory. Residual chlorine content was tested using the Lovibond Comparator using DPD 1 tablets (N,N Diethyl-1.4 Phenylenediamine sulphate) to check colour changes. Specimens within the range 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million (ppm) were considered satisfactory. The pH was measured with the same equipment using phenol red tablets. Specimens with pH ranging between 6.5 and 8.5 were considered satisfactory. The results were reported as proportions.",

In Kadoma City, in this epidemic, the use of municipal water was protective, compared to water from other sources (AOR = 0.38, p = 0.01). Similar findings were obtained in Harare by Gonese G, et al., in 2008. (Risk Factors associated with salmonella outbreak in Budiriro Suburb, Harare City, Zimbabwe, 2008-Unpublished). The laboratory tests on municipal water which was of satisfactory bacteriological and residual chlorine levels support the findings. At the same time, families who accessed water from municipal supply are more likely to access water in the family home. This study demonstrated that distance of the water source from home increased risk of developing diarrhoea. This results in families accessing less than the required amount of water per day, compromising personal hygiene practices such as hand washing.",
