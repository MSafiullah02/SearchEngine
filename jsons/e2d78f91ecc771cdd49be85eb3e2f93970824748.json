[17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] For example, influenza virus and bovine coronaviruses require sialic acid residues for cell bind-cell surface negative charge, formation of a bridge between the negatively charged cell surface and adeno-ing. 29, 30 In contrast to these enveloped viruses, the molecular mechanisms of cell entry employed by adeno-virus particle, or an increase in the permeability of cell monolayers. In the first instance, one need not implicate viruses are only partially understood, 26,31 and the importance of cell surface charge in viral attachment and additional or alternative receptors. Binding and internalization would occur via fiber and penton base, albeit entry has not been evaluated to date. Our recent work has revealed that enzymatic removal of negatively more efficiently after negation of the charge barrier. In contrast, a bridging effect of the polycations could occur charged sialic acid residues from epithelial cell surface glycoconjugates significantly increases adenovirus-through enhancement of fiber or penton base binding, or through bridging of an alternative viral protein to a cell mediated gene transfer, 28 suggesting that the negative charge of sialic acid residues on cell surface glycocon-receptor.
