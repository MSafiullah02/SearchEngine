The unexpected nature of natural disasters often shapes the damage and human suffering that ensue as well as the disparity between human needs and resources available to immediately confront the utilitarian goal of doing the most good or benefit(s) for as many people as possible with a minimal level of harm. 13 In disaster scenarios, the ethical goal generally entails finding some means to minimize the damaging social consequences. As such, actions that will lead positive social consequences are preferred 14 and usually pursued. This is important considering the significant physical, psychological, social, and environmental kinds of harm that are associated with disasters 15 and which must be engaged from a broad perspective.",

Engaging these tasks demands some training and re-training of actors within and outside the healthcare sector. 17 This is because on the one hand, professionals work-8 Naomi Zack, Ethics for Disaster (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2010 ing in disaster situations face urgent choices which usually diverge from their normal and accustomed duty-related or deontological ethos. 18 On the other hand, nonhealthcare-based actors will have varying desires to render help to victims of disasters, desires which they will hardly be able to adequately translate into positive \"clinical outcomes\" in the absence of prior and proper training. Although disasters are by nature sudden, they are not completely void of the influence of human agency, hence, human culpability. Scholars like Dranseika share this view and argue that humans causally contribute to the negative outcomes of even such paradigmatic natural disasters as earthquakes, typhoons, and volcano eruptions. 19 This remark underscores the notion that some disasters may be either preventable or their overall impacts limited when relevant and carefully orchestrated human actions are taken before they occur or during ongoing disaster episodes. Whereas scholars like Bhan 20 usually emphasize this preventive approach, there has been little articulation of specifics in relation to accomplishing such a task. A possible reason for the difficulty in articulating a preventing approach, at least on a broad scale, to public health disasters involves the complex interplay between pre-disaster factors, the causal linkages between human and non-human parameters, and the biologically nuanced roles that microbial organisms play in their onset.",

            "text": "Due to the nascent nature of the moral reflections on the ethical dynamics of disasters, the ethical approaches have generally been speculative, tentative or lacking. Perhaps, a striking approach is that of Kalokairinou who contends that a virtue ethics approach which creates a virtuous disposition in persons responding to disaster situations constitutes a richer and more efficient way of dealing with the associated moral dilemmas. 38 Put another way, Kalokairinou seems to be saying that if all the potential relevant actors for particular kinds of disasters may be identified before 25 a given disaster so that certain virtues are infused into them, then they will more likely than not act virtuously during disasters. If this interpretation is true, then responding ethically to disasters will entail a long-term moral endeavor that will need to involve every segment of the society. How such a task may be counted worthy of pursuit in an increasingly pluralistic, secularized, and post-modern world remains the major setback to this approach but it does not render it void of logical credence. Perhaps, partly because the scholarly discussion on disaster bioethics has only recently begun, 39 some scholars believe that the best that can be attained in handling disasters is a non-ideal ethical approach. 40 Unlike the field of disaster bioethics, reflection on public health ethics goes a few years back, and are greater in volume. Some of the seminal writings in this line of ethical reflection include Harris and Holm who emphasize the moral duty of not infecting others. For them, failure to act on this obligation translates into deliberately harming others. Yet, a system of compensation may be necessary to motivate people to comply. 41 Kass argues that a public health ethics approach needs to reduce morbidity or mortality and minimize any existing social injustices while adopting fair procedures. 42 Callahan and Jennings contend that ethics and public health cannot be advanced without taking into consideration the values of the general society as well as that of the particular communities where the public ethical course of action is needed. 43 This echoes Rhodes age-long remark that the practice of medicine is inseparable from the values of the society in which its practice occurs. 44 If contemporary public health is bereft of national boundaries and is inherently global, 45 then engaging the ethical issues generated by public health inevitably needs an approach that is local and context specific, globally sensitive, and nuanced. The absence of a global health policy response further highlights the necessity of such an approach. 46 Roberts and Reich posit that an elaboration of consequences, fostering the flourishing of communities, balancing of conflicting rights and a quest for justification are cardinal features of public ethical analyses, as well as the need to understand moral alternatives. 47 Whereas moral values are integral to decision making in the 39 context of public health, pursuing the welfare or interests of the larger society will often engender tensions in individualistic societies. 48 Yet, there is no evidence to show that moral tensions that are tied to the balancing of conflicting interests and priorities are exclusively felt in non-communally structured societies. This partly explains why justice and the need to pursue justice in multiple ways remains a recurring decimal in public health. 49 Hence, it is not surprising that the dilemmas central to public health ethics revolve around how to ethically weigh and balance individual against population health needs 50,51 how to balance health-related harms amidst members of society at the individual and collective planes of differing interests 52,53 as well as how to ethically justify any one course of action that is chosen or suggested for public health policy and implementation. 54 A recent and interesting issue relates to the obligations of healthcare workers to infectious disease patients as well as to patients during infectious disease outbreaks. 55 An examination of the disaster bioethics and public health ethics literature clearly brings to the fore the observation that the idea of public health disasters has not received academic attention. As such, this novel area of bioethical inquirywhich reflects the intersection of disaster bioethics and public health ethicsdemands critical scrutiny and exploration. This conceptual lacuna invariably explains the absence of a moral framework for addressing the moral perplexities of PHDs. It is against this backdrop that this book seeks to elaborate the concept of public health disasters, fashion a GEF for addressing the attendant moral quandaries, and, ultimately, contribute to the scholarly conversation on global bioethics.",

In developing economies where resources are usually limited and/or poorly managed, this will lead to the disintegration of healthcare systems. This may be exemplified by the closure of hospitals and clinics which invariably increases social suffering as well as the burdens of infectious diseases including tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, enteric and respiratory illnesses, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. 64 The death-related disaster feature of Ebola virus outbreak has always been played out since the first outbreak in 1976. For example, the 2013-2015 episode recorded a 39.5% case-fatality rate and produced more than 11,000 deaths. 65 Since some of the deceased were children, mothers, fathers, and other subsets of dear ones, it can be said that some type of emotional, financial or social disarray also accompany Ebola outbreaks as an exemplar of PHDs. During the Congo Ebola outbreak of 1995, healthcare workers and many people living in the community of the index case fled their homes amidst the confusion and rising death toll. 66 This clearly illustrates the displacement-related disaster dimension of Ebola diseases, and it adds another conceptual justification for placing EVD under the category of PHDs. Scholars like Nancy Kass note that EVD ignites some of the worst fears in a globalized world, especially in terms of the ease with which it transcends borders. 67 This implies that public health disasters are global or at least have some intrinsic tendency to become global.",

Beyond limiting the effectiveness of combination drug regimens, 70 drug resistance influences the further dispersal of resistance within and amongst communities and between economic and geographic divides, 71 exhibiting an unsettling ripple effect. This feature clearly entails the disease/disorder and death parameters of disasters, and the physical as well as psychological suffering that comes with it (as in most disease states) 72 comes with different kinds of social, personal, and economic disarray. If drug resistance has the conceptual dimensions to be classed as a type of disaster, then non-apparent or silent forms of drug resistance will be more \"disastrous\". Atypical drug-resistant tuberculosis (ADR-TB) belongs to such a class. Indeed, scholars like Viens and Littmann recently mused that antimicrobial drug resistance constitutes a slowly emerging disaster. 73 Pandemic influenza can also be described as a public health disaster. One-third of the world's population was estimated to be infected and had clinically apparent illnesses during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. 74 201,200 respiratory deaths (ranging from 105,700-395,600) with an additional 83,300 cardiovascular deaths were estimated to have occurred. 75 The global mortality rate for the 1957-1959 influenza pandemic was moderate relative to that of the 1918 pandemic but was approximately 10-fold greater than that of the 2009 pandemic. 76 Deaths resulting from pandemic influenza, the attendant disruption of personal and social flourishing due to control measures such as quarantine, as well as disarray due to the oftassociated panic 77 put influenza outbreaks in the category of PHDs. The preceding analysis shows that Ebola virus and pandemic influenza outbreaks are diseases of significant public health concern that may bring about devastating social consequences. Their disaster dynamics are tied to the destruction, death, displacement, disappearance, and disarray that they cause.",

            "text": "All public health disasters cause death to different degrees. For example, the 1976 Ebola Sudan outbreak had a mortality rate of 53%, the second outbreak in Zaire also in 1976 had a rate of 89% and the third outbreak in Sudan in 1979 had a mortality rate of 65%. 96 These figures translate not only into the deaths of individual human beings including mothers, fathers, children, uncles, and aunties but also engender the social, personal and economic disruption of the lives of the dependents (children and spouses), parents, and associates of the victims. The morbidity wrought by the 2014 Ebola outbreak which killed more than half of infected persons further highlights the mortality of this public health issue and its disastrous consequences. It likewise underscores the importance of a proper pragmatic and ethical approach, especially in terms of the ease with which the disease transcended borders 97 and rapidly acquired a global status. With the rise in rapid air-transportation capabilities today which readily moves people including the infected from one region to another (potentially exporting diseases), it is no surprise that there have been suggestions that quantitative analysis of worldwide air-traffic patterns may enable cities and countries around the world to better anticipate the risks of importing global infectious diseases. 98 The air transportation restrictions that were instituted during the 2014 Ebola outbreak illustrates this public health preventive approach. Commercial airlines are a suitable environment for the spread of pathogens carried by passengers or crew; as such, transmission of infectious diseases during commercial air travel is an important public health issue 99 locally and globally. In the context of public health disasters, however, the required restriction in the transportation of goods and human cartel will bring about some disruption in social life. Consider, for instance, Mr. G who is a business man living in an area where an outbreak of Ebola has recently taken place. If his primary business involves airtravel to buy stock, a travel restriction will negatively affect him. In addition, the local hysteria and fear may keep people away from patronizing his business. Consequently, those directly and indirectly dependent on his economic input will bear some significant pecuniary loss. This is only hypothetical; yet, it illustrates the notion that preparedness efforts need to take into serious consideration the associated complex social dynamics that often surround disaster scenarios. In the hypothetical case, it will be hard to imagine that Mr. G may not seek for alternative travel channels to keep his business alive. It is equally plausible that acts of corruption may create loopholes that will enable Ebola-positive undiagnosed people to circumvent any travel barriers meant to curtail the spread of infection. These pragmatic possibilities again echo the importance of an all-inclusive approach that pays serious attention to all underlying social factors that may shape the actions and inactions of moral agents during PHDs. It also echoes the importance of local solidarity and cooperation as well as well-coordinated international solidarity during public health disasters. If solidarity, as Featherstone opines, involves creating new ways of relating and interaction, 100 then any moral framework developed towards engaging the ethical quandaries that PHDs generate must incorporate creative relational approaches.",

            "text": "Although the death, destruction, and social disarray that accompany disease outbreaks such as Ebola viral diseases and pandemic influenza demonstrate the social impacts of public health disasters locally and their global dimensions, the public health consequences of natural disasters such as earthquakes can offer some additional perspectives. To be sure, by 1997 it was estimated that natural disasters such as earthquakes had claimed more than 3 million lives while negatively affecting the lives of other 800 million people as well as causing more than 50 billion USD loss at a global level. 101 These figures approach disaster proportions and reflect the death, destruction, and destruction aspects of the six Ds. On the other hand, communicable diseases are also brought to the fore during earthquakes, locally and globally. For instance, dengue fever was imported into the United States during the 2010 Haiti 99 Alexandra Mangili and Mark A Gendreau, \"Transmission of Infectious Diseases During Commercial Air Travel,\" The Lancet 365, no. 9463 (2005) . Pp. 989, 994. 100 David Featherstone, Solidarity: Hidden Histories and Geographies of Internationalism (Zed Books, 2012) . P. 5. 101 Eric K. Noji, \"The Nature of Disasters: General Characteristics and Public Health Effects,\" in The Public Health Consequences of Disasters, ed. Eric K. Noji (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997). Pp. 3-4. Earthquake. 102 Health infrastructures are likewise targets of natural disasters such as earthquakes, 103 further hindering and complicating the speed and type of available health responses. In addition, the destruction of houses that accompanies earthquakes expose victims to environmental disease vectors including mosquitoes, lice, and fleas. 104 However, it is not only the disease dynamics of earthquakes on a global transmission scale that cause concerns. The enhanced interconnectivity in traditional media and the new social media platforms can rapidly distribute real but disturbing images of the carnage of earthquakes and the associated public health sequelae. These platforms effectively transmit the horrors and realities of earthquakes, the distress of the victims, as well as the overwhelming burdens of the local healthcare system to other parts of the world. But disturbing as this may be, it equally provides an avenue through its capacity to stimulate external acts of solidarity to help lessen the burdens of such public health disasters. As Keim and Noji reported, during the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, social media platforms were the source of what people around the world knew. It also served as a new forum for collective intelligence, social convergence, and community activism, and within the first two days of the earthquake led to donations of more than $5 million to the American Red Cross. 105 The visceral-type of identification with disaster victims as vulnerable people needing urgent rescue and care which can thereafter elicit acts of solidarity underscores the significance of how burdens of a locality can rapidly become a global burden that demands attention and solutions. At the same time, however, not any kind of international assistance is needed during public health disasters. For instance, Noji argues that a hasty response that is devoid of prior impartial assessment will only complicate the chaos of disasters such as earthquakes. As such, it is better to wait until real needs have been identified. 106 Silent public health disasters such as atypical drug-resistant tuberculosis also exert a number of global dimensions. In traditional western societies and in westernized climes, most people value individual freedom and construe it an inviolable \"right\". In the American context where the ethos of moralism, meliorism, and individualism hold sway, 107 the fate of those carrying an infectious disease is generally not tied to that of the collective society. This is indeed the genesis of the moral tension in public health ethics where the atomization of persons' interests run contrary to collective interests. Applied to the context of ADR-TB, an autonomy-driven ideology naturally runs against compliance to public health directives, especially when they involve bearing burdens that are directly removed from the personal risks and interests of individuals.",

In this regard, a relational-based moral system that reckons with the relationship of people to other people, the infected versus the non-infected and the relationship between microbial life and people offers a useful and remarkable means of addressing this moral quandary and the attendant pragmatic issues.",

If this is true, the voice of reasoned insights from non-bioethics academic disciplines is relevant, especially in areas of shared themes. Four representative types of global problems \u00e0 la public health disasters across geographic and cultural divides are first selected. This is followed by using an ethical lens that closely mirrors the particular disaster to engage and formulate context-suitable ethical resolutions. For instance, the African moral lens of Ubuntu is applied to Ebola virus outbreaks due to the general origin of such outbreaks from that part of the world. In the case of atypical drug-resistant tuberculosis, a completely new ethical lens is developed based on the specific parameters associated with its dynamics. The relevant transnational nuances and limitations associated with each context-specific ethical lens, the common linkages around each of the PHDs, as well as the overlapping quandaries are then systematically identified and clarified. These are ultimately used to frame a global normative framework for engaging public health disasters as a class of global health problems.",

This ethical lens will show that an other-centric cognitive frame of mind is exigent to dealing with the moral quandaries raised by EVDs.
