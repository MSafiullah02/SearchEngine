Those concerned about biosafety risks of certain GOF experiments have used the term \u201cpotential pandemic pathogens\u201d to denote the small subset of GOF research that poses a risk of widespread transmission of a highly virulent pathogen [2, 3]. The National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity refers to this small subset as GOF research of concern (GOFROC) [4]. The funding pause, which initially covered 18 National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2013funded influenza virus and coronavirus projects, was reduced to 11 projects by December 2014. For comparison, a search of the NIH Reporter Database shows well over 200 projects naming influenza virus or coronaviruses in the title or abstract; thus the funding moratorium affects <5% of research on these viruses funded by the NIH.",

Indeed, public health officials from the United States have indicated [8, 9] that they use the mutations identified in the noted GOFROC experiments on influenza A(H5N1) virus [10, 11] to prioritize surveillance. Given that no pandemic of A(H5N1) influenza has occurred, there is no rigorous way to identify whether incorporating that information has improved the outcome of surveillance. Indeed, there are reasons to think that prioritizing strains showing those mutations might in some cases be misleading (Table 1). Moreover, each of the variants identified as potential risk indicators in the GOFROC experiments had previously been identified as such in safe, non-GOFROC studies by using alternative approaches [24], as shown in Table 1.\n",

This fact is accepted by most, if not all, critics of GOFROC or potential pandemic pathogen research. When weighing the benefits of GOFROC against those of alternative approaches [25], the issue is not whether GOF can be useful, which it often can be, but whether the risks of GOFROC are justified by unique benefits that cannot be achieved by safe approaches. Of the examples of public health or clinical benefits cited by Kilianski et al, some are not the result of GOFROC. Of those that are, the surveillance benefits at least can and have been achieved through alternative, safer means.",
