Macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, which are very common in the elderly, have been found to be associated with a physiological decline in various body functions, which can lead to higher morbidity and mortality [2]. Nutrient status represents an important factor contributing to immune competence, since undernutrition impairs the immune system, suppressing immune functions that are fundamental to host protection. Undernutrition leading to an impairment of immune function can be due either to insufficient intake of energy and macronutrients or to specific deficiencies in some particular micronutrients, although often these occur in combination [4].",

Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the organism, with three major biological roles, as a catalyst, structural, and regulatory ion. It plays a critical role in organism homeostasis, in immune function, in oxidative stress, in apoptosis, and in other physiological activities [2, 5]. Thus, zinc deficiency may adversely affect the immunological status, increase oxidative stress, lead to the generation of inflammatory cytokines, and influence the progression of many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, age-related degenerative diseases, and various malignancies [5]. Zinc deficiency is known to decrease innate immune function. It particularly impairs the lytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, reduces natural killer T (NKT)-cell cytotoxicity and immune signaling, influences the neuroendocrine-immune pathway, and alters cytokine generation in mast cells [6, 7].",

            "text": "However, excessive amounts of some nutrients may also impair immune function. Overnutrition, combined with an inactive lifestyle and sedentary behavior, promotes the accumulation of visceral fat and leads to obesity. Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation and the development of systemic metabolic dysfunction that appears to be aetiologically associated with obesity-linked disorders [2, 8]. Adipose tissue acts as a key endocrine organ by releasing bioactive substances, known as adipokines, that may have either pro- or anti-inflammatory activities [9]. The production of pro-inflammatory adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leptin, retinol-binding protein 4, lipocalin 2, IL-6, IL-18, and angiopoietin-like protein 2, in expanding fat tissue increases, while the concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines are reduced [9]. This process is accompanied by an infiltration of adipose tissue with pro-inflammatory mediators and the induction of a low-grade inflammatory state, which is characterized by elevated levels of circulating inflammation markers, such as IL-6, TNF, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Adipose tissue is infiltrated with macrophages in two separate polarization states: M1, which produces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2, which produces anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, it has been proposed that in the adipose tissue, a phenotypic switch takes place toward the macrophages of M1-phenotype, promoting the inflammatory state. This low-grade systemic inflammation is known to be associated with the development of atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, insulin resistance, and the promotion of tumor growth [10]. It was also demonstrated that diet-induced obesity recruits monocytes from the periphery to the brain following herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 latency in mice [11], leading to an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response and the promotion of neurodegeneration. While these phenomena are not limited to the elderly, they often tend to be exacerbated in older people who, for one reason or another, exercise less than the young [2].",

For example, a positive effect of a 3-month regimen of comprehensive lifestyle changes (plant-based diet, moderate exercise, stress management, and improved social support) on increased telomerase activity was demonstrated in men with low-risk prostate cancer. After a 5-year follow-up, relative telomere lengths of lymphocytes were increased in the lifestyle intervention group and decreased in the control group [12]. According to the findings of another study on more than 23,000 adults, a healthy lifestyle alone lowered the risk of developing chronic diseases with known inflammatory etiology by 78% [13]. Although such changes are thought to be beneficial, more investigations are needed to confirm whether this is really the case, and the full biological implications remain to be determined in large RCTs [2, 14].",

In addition to interactions with pathogens, host microbiome and nutrition, exercise and stress, and many other extrinsic factors are crucial modulators of this immunosenescence process [2]. In the next sections, we briefly describe the observed age-related changes in the immune system and then outline the possible contribution of inflammaging and immunosenescence to neuroinflammation and finally discuss the modulatory potential of nutrition and active lifestyle thereon.",

This phenomenon results from poorly understood age-related impairments in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment which generates fewer T-cell precursors in adult and later life, on the one hand, and thymic involution at puberty which markedly reduces the production of mature T cells from their precursors, on the other hand [32].",

Age-related modification within the HSC compartment may be partly due to the \u201cintrinsic cellular aging\u201d of HSCs themselves. Aged HSCs demonstrate more accumulated DNA damage, telomere attrition, and epigenetic deregulation, often in combination with an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2, 36]. Such events may also lead to progressive myeloproliferative disorders and the malignant transformation of HSCs. In addition to such \u201cintrinsic\u201d HSC age effects, the extracellular and stromal matrix of the aging bone marrow (which normally nurtures and drives stem cell production) also undergoes dramatic structural changes in terms of the numbers of stromal cells and osteoblasts and reduced production of IL-7 (Fig. 14.1). The aged pool of HSCs is often characterized by a marked shift in lymphoid and myeloid lineage output. Such age-associated myeloid skewing of the differentiation potential, together with decreased homing efficiency, contributes to changes in the cellular composition of the HSC compartment and is believed to be an important contributor to the decline of immune competence in the elderly [2, 37, 38].",

Most elderly people do retain some residual thymic function, which may act to provide a continuous low-level input of new na\u00efve T cells (Fig. 14.1) to the periphery [41] at least until extreme old age [18]. The end result of thymic involution is that the individual is equipped with a set of na\u00efve T cells early in life, but which are not constantly replaced at the same level throughout life. Thus, elderly people have vanishingly small numbers of na\u00efve T cells and accumulations of memory T cells (Figs. 14.1 and 14.2), mostly specific for the pathogens that they have previously encountered [18].",

Early data indicated that younger and older people possessed phenotypically identical Tregs but that suppressive function waned in the latter [48]. More recent data confirm that aging significantly affects the generation, homeostasis, diversity, and functional competence of Tregs. A decline of thymic function disturbs the thymic Treg production and also seems to be compensated for through the peripheral expansion of pre-existing Tregs and/or through the conversion of conventional T cells into Tregs [49], as had been demonstrated using T-cell clonal culture models much earlier [50]. Thus, due to the leading role of Tregs in immune homeostasis, an age-related deterioration of Tregs (Fig. 14.1) might induce either excessive immunity (impacting a chronic inflammation as well as increasing the risk for autoimmunity) or, conversely, an age-related increase of Treg activity might result in failing immunity (raising the risk of malignancies and infectious diseases) in the elderly [49, 51, 52].",

Such persistent age-related chronic inflammation represents an extreme stress factor for the immune system, causing eventual exhaustion.

It can occur by a selection of T cells with an elevated affinity for self-antigens or latent viruses, which are at the same time also pro-inflammatory. The chronic inflammation additionally resulting in tissue injury and apoptosis attracts dendritic cells (DC), which in elderly people have an impaired ability to take up apoptotic cells (Fig. 14.1). Instead, they induce a vicious circle with a further pro-inflammatory response and increased reactivity to self-DNA, which may be more immunogenic in the elderly due to increased hypomethylation [16]. Additionally, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), present on proteins released during cell necrosis and promoting sterile inflammation, also become more frequent with advancing age [17, 18].",

Our results from the Berlin Aging Study II confirmed these findings, where we also found an age-related increase in frequencies of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes [63].

Peripheral low-grade inflammation may promote inflammatory processes in the aged brain (Fig. 14.2) by modulating glial cells toward a more active pro-inflammatory state, leading to the loss of neuroprotective function, to neuronal dysfunction, and to the accumulation of brain tissue damage [65\u201367]. Systemic inflammation may, therefore, increase the risk of developing cognitive impairment, neurological disorders, and neurodegeneration [68\u201370].

Although no agreement exists on the basic mechanisms involved in this process, neuroinflammation appears to be the main contributor that links together many factors associated with cognitive aging [65, 71]. As we age, we experience greater susceptibility to memory impairments following an immune challenge that is characterized by an increased and prolonged production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the otherwise healthy aged brain [65, 72]. It is widely established that both aging and stress can affect the neuroendocrine system, activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and cause the anterior pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (Fig. 14.3). This, in turn, induces the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland into the circulation [73]. Cortisol affects the immune system in different ways by regulating the expression of cytokines [74], chemokines, and adhesion molecules and by affecting immune cell migration, maturation, and differentiation [65, 72, 75]. High levels of cortisol can negatively influence hippocampal neurogenesis directly or indirectly through the regulation of the expression of cytokines and their receptors on the brain and immune cells.",

These hyperactive \u201c dark microglia\u201d (Fig. 14.3) frequently reach into synaptic clefts with their highly ramified and thin processes, extensively encircle axon terminals and dendritic spines, and engulf them [76, 77]. Aging and neurodegeneration are characterized by dysregulated interactions with synapses, resulting in neuronal loss, which, in turn, represents the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline [77]. These conditions can sensitize the aged brain to produce an exaggerated response following exposure to a stressor or to the presence of an immune stimulus in the periphery [78]. Altered microglia profiles together with impairments in key regulatory systems can lead to prolonged neuroinflammation and age-related neurobehavioral complications [65, 79].",

Chronic exposure to inflammatory mediators may disrupt the endothelial barrier and allow for the transfer of immune cells and numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines into the brain parenchyma that, in turn, can modulate microglial phenotype and reactivity and drive low-grade brain inflammation. Brain cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, as well as peripheral immune cells, such as T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, participate in inflammation (Fig. 14.3). It would provide an inflammatory milieu that is populated by all these resident and additional infiltrating immune cells that participate in a complex interplay between secreted inflammatory modulators and activated cell surface receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [65]. These receptors are primarily expressed on cells that play central roles in inflammatory response, including macrophages and microglia [80].",

Recent work suggests that microglia undergo a process of senescence, similar to the one in peripheral immune cells. Senescent and hyperactive microglia have been detected in the aged and diseased brain [81]. The aging brain, in turn, is apparently able to modulate the immune system and to support the recruitment of immune cells from the periphery, thereby contributing further to immunosenescence and neuroinflammation [82]. In addition, macrophages change their protective M2-phenotype to the pro-inflammatory M1-phenotype, thus contributing to further neuroinflammation [65]. As the aged brain is already \u201cprimed\u201d to respond to inflammatory stimuli, additional stress or infection may induce more detrimental changes in the cognitive functioning of aged individuals [78, 83]. Furthermore, the age-related concurrent reduction of anti-inflammatory molecules also contributes to a sensitization to extrinsic and intrinsic stressors. T cells produce less IL-4 and IL-10 and more interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), thereby promoting microglial activation. This has detrimental consequences for neural precursor cells, leading to a decrease of neurogenesis (Fig. 14.3) as well as increased decrements in learning and memory [84, 85].",

CR has been shown to delay signs of immunosenescence in animals and is considered today as the only known method to prolong median as well as maximal lifespan in several tested species, from invertebrates to rodents and even including nonhuman primates [32, 87]. Thus, in rodents and nonhuman primates, CR leads to an attenuation of the age-related shift from na\u00efve to memory-phenotype T cells and maintains a higher number of na\u00efve T cells in aged animals [88]. Furthermore, the age-associated rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF, and the resulting pro-inflammatory state of an aged immune system can be reversed by CR. It has been reported that the age-related decrease in the proliferative capacity of T cells (due to the shift from na\u00efve to memory-phenotype T cells) can be reversed by CR [2, 32].",

Furthermore, short-term CR may well be feasible, whereas long-term dietary restriction might have detrimental psychological and other effects in humans, especially in the older population, making its practicality questionable [2, 89, 90].

Atarashi et al. identified 17 strains of bacteria preferentially inducing colonic Tregs which reduced symptoms in models of colitis and allergic diarrhea in mice [102]. Thus, supplementation with tailor-made mixtures of probiotics may be effective in modulating immune responses where the use of single strains is ineffective. This may be one reason why the results of the many human probiotics supplementation trials have often been equivocal since mostly a single strain was used even if it was the \u201cright\u201d strain [2]. The mechanism of action of the mixed bacterial strains is the induction of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ Tregs by bacterial antigens, which in turn stimulate the intestinal epithelial cells to produce TGF-\u00df1, but not inflammatory IL-6, and TNF. Fecal samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and atopy have been reported to contain relatively low amounts of some of the same bacterial strains, suggesting their relevance to human disease as well as in the animal model.",

It has been shown that zinc supplementation enhances the innate immune responses by increasing phagocytosis and T-cell functionality [120]. An increase in serum zinc concentration was associated with an increase in the number of T cells [119]. Zinc supplementation was also able to improve the generation of NK cells from CD34+ cell progenitors through the increased expression of the GATA-3 transcription factor [7].",

Bioactive components of spices, such as eugenol and 6-gingerol, prevent the release of TNF and IL-1\u03b2 [125] in vitro stimulated macrophages [126]. Curcumin has been shown to suppress the inflammatory mediators NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and COX-2 [127], anethole inhibits NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activation and cytokine production [128], and cinnamaldehyde blocks the age-related activation of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and targets inflammatory COX-2 as well as induces nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [129]. Ursolic acid, which is present in many fruits, including apples, pears, plums, bearberries, loquat, jamun, and rosemary, has been found to exert antitumor activity against colon cancer [130], breast cancer [131], nonsmall cell lung cancer [132], pancreatic cancer [105], melanoma [133], multiple myeloma [134], cervical cancer [135], and prostate cancer [108].

Compelling evidence has shown that dietary phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols, have properties that may suppress neuroinflammation and prevent toxic and degenerative effects in the brain. The mechanisms by which polyphenols exert their action are not fully understood, but it is clear that they have a direct effect through their antioxidant activities. They have also been shown to modulate intracellular signaling cascades, including the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Nrf2, and MEK pathways. Polyphenols also interact with a range of neurotransmitters, illustrating that these compounds can promote their health benefits in the brain through a direct, indirect, or complex action [136]. Approaches with multiple antioxidant nutrients to block the oxidative stress related to the systemic and brain inflammation pathways may, therefore, prevent or delay the cognitive impairments by preventing microglia aging [137].",

Thus, more clinical studies are needed to determine the amounts of dietary agents needed to delay aging and age-related diseases and to investigate their effects on different age groups [107]. Furthermore, when identifying dietary approaches to promote healthy brain aging, a holistic approach should be considered, including nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle factors, which not only target the brain but also overall cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic health [144].",

Physical exercise and physical activity in later life might target modifiable risk factors of aging, such as low-grade inflammation, inducing immunoprotective and neuroprotective functions (Fig. 14.5) [150, 151]. Numerous studies have revealed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects following physical activity (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5), which potentially exert beneficial effects on neuroplasticity, affect the expression of neurotrophins, and therefore help to maintain normal neuronal functions [152]. Barrientos and colleagues observed an inhibition of neuroinflammation (caused by infection) in rats performing exercises and an increased induction of BDNF mRNA in the brain of otherwise sedentary animals [153]. Further studies with aged mice revealed that wheel running inhibits the pro-inflammatory state of microglia and their ability to proliferate, thus inducing a pro-neurogenic phenotype [154].",

Some of them are exerted on adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, immune system cells, and the cardiovascular system (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5). These effects include the modulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles, redox-sensitive transcription factors, and antioxidant and prooxidant enzymes and repair proteins [155]. Regular physical activity combined with nutritional interventions can reduce the size of adipocytes and attenuate inflammation in adipose tissue by phenotype switching from pro-inflammatory M1-type to anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophages (Fig. 14.4). In addition, a reduction in the numbers of circulating pro-inflammatory-type monocytes and an increase in the numbers of Tregs were found in the peripheral blood of individuals following physical activity [156, 157].",

In dealing with this demographic change, what people make of the added years of their lives will be the most important aspect but will only be advantageous to the individual and to society at large if people can remain active participants in daily life and work [65]. Maintaining immunological and cognitive functions will be paramount, but their performances are known to decrease with increasing age, even in overtly healthy individuals. Preventing and/or attenuating immunosenescence and inflammation and delaying cognitive decline are probably the most effective measures for postponing the point of time at which individuals are no longer able to lead an independent life [65]. Effective pharmacological treatments, especially for cognitive but also for the immune decline, remain unavailable. Therefore, we will need a more holistic view of the aging process, where the dynamics of the interaction between environment, intestinal microbiota, and host must be taken into consideration. We should also take into account the age-associated physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract as well as age-related modifications in lifestyle, nutritional behavior, and impaired functionality in the immune system of the elderly population [2, 65]. Some modifiable lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and physical and cognitive inactivity, have been identified as being associated with an increased risk of cognitive and immune decline [166]. Encouragingly, exercise can have a protective effect, even if initiated in advanced old age [2, 65, 167]. The intake of antioxidant nutrients reduces both systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation during aging [168]. Due to the fact that diet component targets are different, combining different nutrients acting on convergent anti-inflammatory pathways may result in an increased anti-inflammatory efficacy [144, 169, 170].",

Age-related modification within the HSC compartment may be partly due to \u201cintrinsic cellular aging\u201d of HSCs themselves, with accumulated DNA damage, telomere attrition, and epigenetic deregulation. The extracellular and stromal matrix also undergoes dramatic structural changes in terms of the numbers of stromal cells and osteoblasts and the reduced production of IL-7. The aged pool of HSC shows a marked shift in lymphoid and myeloid lineage output. Thymic involution (b) involves both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including the thymic microenvironment as well as the impaired development of aged thymocytes themselves. A progressive replacement of lymphoid tissue by fatty tissue takes place, accompanied by a reduction of the active areas of thymopoiesis. The end result of thymic involution is vanishingly small numbers of na\u00efve TC and accumulations of memory TC (c), mostly specific for the pathogens that they have previously encountered. Age-affected Tregs (d) can induce chronic inflammation, an increased risk of autoimmunity, but also be responsible for diminished immunity. Elevated inflammatory immune mediators, SARS (e), are responsible for the activation of self-reactive memory BC, producing increased levels of auto-Ab (f), which are frequent in aged individuals as a result of tissue damage and apoptosis. Repetitive antigenic challenges over the lifetime (g) may stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the maintenance of persistent chronic inflammation. Self-reactive B and T cells (h) recognize a self-antigen and differentiate into memory and effector cells due to a breakdown of the control of autoreactivity. Chronic inflammation additionally resulting in tissue injury and apoptosis attracts DCs, which in elderly people have impaired the ability to take up apoptotic cells (i). Instead, they induce a vicious circle with a further pro-inflammatory response and increased reactivity to self-DNA, which may be more immunogenic in the elderly. Additionally, DAMPs (I), present in proteins released during cell necrosis, promote sterile inflammation.

The most relevant changes to adaptive immunity are decreased peripheral na\u00efve T cells and the concomitant accumulation of late-stage differentiated memory T cells with reduced antigen receptor repertoire diversity. This phenomenon results from age-related impairments in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and thymic involution. Lifelong exposure to different pathogens is the major driver of the phenotypic changes in the distribution of T-cell subsets over the life course. Aging is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammation (inflammaging). Peripheral immunosenescence and inflammaging may promote neuroinflammation by modulating glial cells toward a more active pro-inflammatory state, leading to a loss of neuroprotective function, to neuronal dysfunction accumulation of brain tissue damage, and to neurodegeneration.

Aging and stress activate the HPA axis to release CRH from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and cause the anterior pituitary gland to secrete ACTH. This, in turn, induces the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland into the circulation. High levels of cortisol can negatively influence hippocampal neurogenesis directly or indirectly through the regulation of an expression of cytokines and their receptors on the brain and immune cells. Peripheral immunosenescence and inflammaging lead to age-related changes in the blood. Chronic exposure to inflammatory mediators may disrupt the endothelial barrier and allow for the transfer of immune cells and numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines into the brain parenchyma that, in turn, can modulate microglial phenotype and reactivity and drive low-grade brain inflammation. Activated microglia and astrocytes change their morphology and function and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 \u03b2, IL-6, and TNF. Macrophages change their protective M2-phenotype to the pro-inflammatory M1-phenotype, thus contributing to further neuroinflammation. This overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators disrupts the delicate balance needed for LTP induction, impairs synaptic plasticity, and reduces the production of BDNF and IGF-1, thus having detrimental consequences for neural precursor cells as well as for the normal neuronal functioning.
