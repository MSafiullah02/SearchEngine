            "text": "Percolation and epidemic spreading are among the most interesting processes unfolding on complex network substrates, and their investigation has attracted a huge interest in the past 20 years [1\u20135]. One of the most successful achievements of this endeavor is the realization that the properties of one of the fundamental models for epidemics without a steady state, the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics [6], can be mapped onto bond percolation [7\u20139]. This connection has permitted the application to the SIR model of the powerful tools devised for percolation, leading to a full understanding of this epidemic process [8,10\u201313]. For the other fundamental class of epidemic dynamics, allowing for a steady, endemic state, whose simplest representative is the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model [6], no direct mapping to a percolative framework is available, and theoretical progress has been slower. In the SIS model, susceptible individuals acquire the disease at rate \u03b2 through any edge connected to an infected individual, while infected individuals spontaneously heal with rate \u03bc. The epidemic threshold \u03bbc defines the value of the ratio \u03bb=\u03b2/\u03bc separating a healthy (absorbing) phase from an endemic one with everlasting activity. Initial work showed that degree heterogeneity leads to disruptive effects on scale-free networks [14], namely, a vanishing threshold in networks with power-law degree distribution P(k)\u223ck-\u03b3 and \u03b3\u22643\n[15,16]. Later efforts have shifted toward less heterogeneous networks, those with \u03b3>3\n[3].",

It was later pointed out that, at the QMF level, the localization of activity around these hubs implies the existence, for small values of \u03bb, of long-lived, but not stationary, states [22,23]. Important progress in this debate is provided in Ref. [24], where it is shown that a genuine non-mean-field effect, mutual reinfection among distant hubs, is the key mechanism triggering the appearance of an endemic stationary state for any \u03bb in networks with \u03b3>5/2. Numerical evidence corroborates this picture, showing that the position of the effective threshold tends to zero with network size for any \u03b3. However, the decay observed is slower than the one predicted by the QMF theory [24\u201326] and, moreover, in contradiction with recent mathematical results derived by Huang and Durrett [27] and Mountford, Valesin, and Yao [28]. An additional puzzling question in this area is the striking disagreement between the exact mathematical prediction for the singular behavior of the prevalence (\u03c1\u223c\u03bb2\u03b3-3, apart from logarithmic corrections) [28] and numerical simulations exhibiting a much faster growth. This lack of a precise agreement between analytics and numerics represents one standing issue in our understanding of epidemic processes on complex topologies.",

[29], and we present a scaling theory for its nontrivial behavior. This theory\u2014which provides a clear understanding of competing physical mechanisms, critical properties, crossover scales, and finite-size effects\u2014is general and can be related with other processes. Second, we apply the results of the first part to SIS dynamics, obtaining in this way for the first time a full understanding of the critical properties of the model. In particular, our theory predicts that the asymptotic behavior in the limit of very large networks (derived exactly in Refs. [27,28] and reassuringly recovered by our approach) can be observed only for huge system sizes, out of reach for present computer resources. We show instead that, for network sizes that can be currently simulated, a preasymptotic regime holds, whose nontrivial properties are determined, providing a prediction for the finite-size scaling of the SIS epidemic threshold in agreement with (previously unexplained) numerical results. Our work reconciles in a comprehensive way the different theories proposed to interpret the behavior of the SIS model, placing them in the proper context regarding the network size considered, and thus ends a long debate between the physics and mathematics communities.",

            "text": "We consider a generalization of the cumulative merging process proposed in Ref. [29], defined along the following lines. In a given network, composed by N nodes, each node i is active with probability pi. Inactive nodes do not play any role apart from determining the topological distances between pairs of active nodes (see below). Each active node i defines a cluster of size 1, associated with an initial mass mi(0). Starting with these initial clusters, an iterative process takes place whose elementary step is the merging of a pair of clusters into a single one. Two clusters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, are merged in a single cluster if there are at least a node i\u03b1 in \u03b1 and a node j\u03b2 in \u03b2, such that di\u03b1,j\u03b2\u2264min{r(m\u03b1),r(m\u03b2)},(1)where di,j is the topological distance between nodes i and j and r(m)\u22651 is an interaction range associated to a cluster of mass m. The mass of the merged cluster is the sum of the masses of the original clusters: m\u03b1+\u03b2=m\u03b1+m\u03b2. The iteration of this procedure converges to a limiting partition of the network that does not depend on the order in which the merging is performed [32]. Notice that if pi=p and r(m)=1, CMP coincides with random site percolation [1]. It is important to remark that Eq. (1) implies that two clusters merge only if each one of them is within the interaction range of the other: An asymmetric situation, with a massive cluster interacting with a far and small cluster, does not lead to merging. In Fig. 1, we present a graphical illustration of the mechanism of the CMP process. We stress again that a cluster is defined as a set of (only) active nodes resulting from the iteration of merging events. Nodes in the same cluster must belong to the same connected component of the underlying network, but they do not need to form a connected component by themselves, as is clear from Figs. 1(c) and 1(d).",

For a node of degree k, the probability that a given neighbor is active is Pa(k)=\u222bka\u221edk\u2032P(k\u2032|k),(3)where P(k\u2032|k) is the conditional probability that a neighbor of a node k has degree k\u2032\n[34]. For uncorrelated networks, P(k\u2032|k)=(k\u2032P(k\u2032)/\u27e8k\u27e9)\n[34]; thus, we have Pa=(ka/kmin)2-\u03b3, independent of k.

This result indicates that a degree-ordered percolation giant component (DOPGC) can exist only up to a finite threshold value, in agreement with Refs. [23,33]. It is useful to discuss the behavior of the order parameter SDOP as a function of ka in this case. For ka=kmin, kc=1. Hence, even for \u03b3>3, there is an interval of ka values such that ka/kc>1. This regime occurs up to a value ka=k0* determined by the condition kc(k0*)=k0*, yielding k0*=kmin(\u03b3-2)/(\u03b3-3).(7)Notice that, for \u03b3=3.2 and kmin=3, k0*=729, a quite large value, while it decays quickly for increasing \u03b3: For \u03b3=3.5, it is already k0*=27. In this regime, the situation is similar to the case \u03b3<3, with practically all active nodes belonging to the DOPGC and SDOP\u2248Na/N\u223cka1-\u03b3. However, one must notice that, even if ka/kc>1, this ratio is not very large, as its maximum value is kmin, corresponding to ka=kmin. Therefore, one never observes the scaling predicted by Eq. (6); as soon as ka is increased, one immediately starts to see the transition to a different regime, where ka/kc<1. In this second regime, a giant component still exists, but some active nodes are isolated (not directly connected to other active nodes) and others are nonisolated but form small clusters. The set of all active nodes is therefore composed by three classes: (1)nonisolated nodes belonging to the DOPGC;(2)nonisolated nodes belonging to small clusters; and(3)isolated nodes, which necessarily do not belong to the DOPGC.",

Upon increasing ka, above the crossover scale k0*, DOP enters the second regime with an increasing presence of isolated nodes and nodes belonging to small DOP clusters. CMP and DOP behaviors start to diverge at this point, because some nodes, even if they are not directly connected to the DOPGC, are at distance 2 from it and, thus, can join the CMPGC if their interaction range is at least 2. In particular, this situation occurs for all small DOP clusters: As their aggregate degree is kagg\u22652ka, they necessarily have a range of interaction r\u22652. For this reason, in this regime all NNI nonisolated nodes belong to the CMPGC. This result is clearly verified in Fig. 2. Notice that NNI/N is finite even well beyond the DOP threshold. In this limit, the formation of the CMPGC is still triggered by the largest DOP cluster (that does not percolate). For any value of \u03b3, there are always nodes in the network with k>kc\u226bka. They form local clusters with a large interaction range that progressively incorporate other small clusters giving rise to a CMPGC, even if no DOPGC is present.

However, if k is large enough, they may still have a large interaction range and may merge with other distant nodes. To analyze this process in detail, let us denote as d(k) the mean distance between a node of degree k and the closest node of degree at least k. In the limit of a large network size, this distance is (see Appendix B for an analytical derivation) d(k)\u22481+\u03b3-3ln(\u03ba)ln(kkmin),(18)where \u03ba=\u27e8k2\u27e9/\u27e8k\u27e9-1 is the network branching factor. Since the interaction range of a node grows linearly with its degree k, it grows faster than the distance to its closest peer. Hence, there exists a degree kx such that r(kx)=d(kx)(19)and, for any k>kx, r(k)>d(k). As a consequence, nodes with k>kx have an interaction range larger (on average) than their mutual topological distance. They can thus merge in pairs with an even larger interaction range, and the process repeats itself, leading to the formation of a CMPGC, comprising all nodes with a degree larger than kx. If we write kx in the form kx=\u03c9ka, the condition (19) implies \u03c9=d(\u03c9ka), which, inserting the explicit expression of d(k), becomes \u03c9\u22481+\u03b3-3ln(\u03ba)ln(\u03c9kakmin).(20)Neglecting constants and terms of the order of ln[ln(ka)], the size of the giant component according to this mechanism scales then as S2\u2248(kxkmin)1-\u03b3=\u03c91-\u03b3(kakmin)1-\u03b3(21)=[\u03b3-3ln(\u03ba)ln(kakmin)](1-\u03b3)(kakmin)1-\u03b3,(22)showing, thus, a power-law decay times a logarithmic correction.",

In an infinite network, when the CMP giant component is formed by distant, mutually interacting hubs (second regime), we can estimate the value of the prevalence (average density of infected nodes) for small \u03bb using the following argument. All actives nodes with a degree larger than kx=\u03c9ka participate in the CMPGC. Each one of these active nodes of degree k infects a number of other nodes of order \u03bbk. Since hubs are distant, these clusters of infected nodes do not overlap; hence, the total prevalence in the system is expected to be [23]\n\u03c1\u223c\u222bkx\u221edk\u03bbkP(k)\u223c\u03bb(\u03c9ka)2-\u03b3.(31)Substituting the values of \u03c9 and ka into Eq.

As discussed above, this prediction is, however, impossible to verify numerically, because the onset of the asymptotic regime could be seen only for exceedingly large networks, which explains the mismatch between the theory of Mountford, Valesin, and Yao and numerical results. In doable simulations of the SIS model, the small \u03bb regime that can be observed is the preasymptotic regime S1 for the corresponding CMP process. In such a regime, since hubs are not well separated, it is not possible to assume that each of them independently infects a number of neighbors of the order of \u03bbk. The derivation of the exponent characterizing the SIS prevalence singularity in this preasymptotic (but long) regime remains an interesting open question for future research.",

In the QMF theory, there are no stochastic fluctuations, and activity in a star graph composed by k+1 nodes persists forever if \u03bb>1/k. In SIS dynamics, instead, activity survives, in a star graph made of k+1 nodes, only for a time of the order of exp(\u03bb2k/a). Hence, if star graphs are independent, the overall activity does not survive for a time scaling exponentially with the system size N. In other words, there is some activity surviving for some time but not a truly steady active state. In the interval \u03bbcQMF<\u03bb<\u03bbcHMF, one should expect a Griffiths-like phase, with a slow decay of \u03c1(t)\n[23], due to the convolution of contributions from a decreasing number of still active individual hubs. Only above a finite threshold, approximately equal to \u03bbcHMF, corresponding to the inverse of the first eigenvalue associated to a delocalized eigenvector [22], is a truly active steady state expected (see Fig. 7). This scenario is consistent, but at odds with numerical simulations [24] and exact mathematical results [39,40], which find an active steady state for any value of \u03bb>0 in the thermodynamic limit.",

If large hubs are in mutual direct contact (i.e., they form an extensive connected cluster), should activity spontaneously disappear in one of them, neighboring hubs would be able to reinfect it; these mutual reinfections would lead to a survival time exponential in N, i.e., a truly active steady state. Unfortunately, the study of degree-ordered-percolation reveals that such an extensive cluster of large hubs always exists only for \u03b3<3. For \u03b3>3, the DOP threshold is finite: The largest hubs are separated and do not form an extensive cluster [23].",

This long-range interaction gives rise, above a critical value \u03bbc(N), to an extensive CMP percolating cluster of active nodes able to reinfect each other at distance and, thus, giving a veritable steady state with finite prevalence \u03c1. The threshold \u03bbc(N) is intermediate between \u03bbcQMF and \u03bbcHMF and vanishes as a function of N (at odds with \u03bbcHMF) but more slowly than \u03bbcQMF. Considering finite networks, while for \u03bbc(N)<\u03bb<\u03bbcHMF a CMP percolating cluster exists and prevalence is finite, for \u03bbcQMF<\u03bb<\u03bbc only small nonpercolating CMP clusters are present. In this case, each of them decays independently, and, thus, a Griffiths-like phase, characterized by \u03c1(t) slowly decaying to zero, is expected (Fig. 7). A numerical validation of this prediction, which is difficult as both interval bounds vanish with the system size, remains a challenge for future numerical studies.",
