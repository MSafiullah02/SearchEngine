Developed nations may say that they have enough resources to tackle such situations, but when it comes to the physical and emotional security of the children, even they have to think manifolds because preparing children for such pandemics need lot of effort and apt planning. The purpose of this chapter is to reflect issues related to children during any infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19. Adults are mature enough to control their emotions and can act patiently, but immature minds are always perplexed and act in a very clingy way when some adverse situation is thrown to them. Children are ardent observers and act according to the reactions of the folks around them. It is difficult for them to conceal their behavior, and it is difficult for parents as well to manage their anxiety levels. During crisis period when social distancing and refrained outdoor activities have brought our children into a knotty situation, it is necessary that we understand their fears and myths, try to resolve their concerns in a polite way and strengthen their minds. At this stage the role of parents, teachers, educational institutes, social media, and international children's organizations need to be redefined. The importance of the decisions taken by the governing bodies should be explained to the children in an effective way, so that they do not panic and reflect a brave attitude. UNICEF in collaboration with international health support systems and departments has a major role to play. Appropriate planning for preparing the children for pandemics has to be incorporated in our system, so that any future crisis can be dealt in an easier way. Schools colleges and other educational institutes should Rakhi Saxena and Shailendra K. Saxena contributed equally as first author.",

The current situation of the world is no less than a world war which has put everyone in a skeptical situation especially dealing with young and blank minds. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created anxieties, turbulence, and fears in the young minds, and they barrage their parents with heaps of questions. COVID-19 has caused a global concern for Public Health Emergency. However, still the ongoing debate on the emergence of virus and its immediate host has proved its homology with bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 (Li et al. 2020) . It is responsible for the social and economic losses worldwide and is being transmitted at a very rapid pace. Health experts are still sailing in turbulent ocean to find an effective drug or vaccine. COVID-19-infected children may be asymptomatic or may present clinical symptoms such as fever, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue including upper respiratory symptoms, congestion (Hong et al. 2020) . Clinical reports also suggest poor immune response of the patients and are still trying to unveil the virus and its menaces (Weiss and Murdoch 2020) . Along with the elderly population who are considered to be at the greater risk, even young children are not spared by the virus. According to the journal Pediatrics, nearly 2143 cases were reported in which 90% of children reported mild or moderate symptoms and were found to be at lower risk. But 6% of children showed intense and acute symptoms although none of the children died (Dong et al. 2020) . Now the main concern was how to tackle the children and teach them to isolate themselves. Figure 15 .1 explains the three categories of people and their role for not letting the infection escalate. Children need to understand the above fact given in the figure more deeply because they usually love to be at crowded places such as schools, parks, etc. and love to play with their friends, so they have more chances to capture the infection and act as major disease transmitters and can intensify the pandemic. Due to lack of knowledge, the lockdown situations or imposing self-isolation on them by their parents may feel like a burden and is making them both apprehensive and restless. Either they are taking it just a vacation which can be enjoyed by numerous ways or they are in a dilemma about the repercussions of not following the rules. Children are always experimenting and believe only when the facts are presented in front of them in a way that they understand the meaning and necessity of refraining themselves from activities which can be the cause of concern.",

But the myths and the pessimistic information surfacing around the children during the critical situations like COVID-19 pandemic may inoculate those fears in children which become a major health concern (Kessler et al. 2005) . The way the parents transfer the information to the children about the pandemic is highly responsible for the fear levels of the children apart from the information received from media, pals, school and other community members, or direct encounter with the infection (Remmerswaal and Muris 2011) . The haunting thoughts that may probably capture kids' minds right now are depicted in Fig. 15 .2. Away from their school, daycares, or routine outings, children are feeling helpless and discomfort for they do not have an idea that when would this mayhem be over and when they will return to normal days. Sans playgrounds and friends, they are in a state of frustration. For older kids it is quite easy because they have the maturity level to understand and level their anxieties. But the younger ones have lots of questions as to: Why so much of hand washing is required? what will happen if they get sick? when will they met their friends? and so on.",
