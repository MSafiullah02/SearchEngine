Primary infection takes place in the majority of cases early in the life and is followed by a lifelong latent infection, from which reactivation may occur with viral shedding at least in the saliva. The outcome of reactivation strongly depends from the host immunological status. In immunodepressed patients, all these three viruses may cause severe diseases, which may be different depending on the virus and on other factors, including host defences. Mostly, hCMV and also HSV1 may cause severe respiratory diseases, whereas the role of EBV in pneumonia is debated [1]. In addition to a direct involvement of these viruses in respiratory diseases, their detection has been associated with other clinical aspects, which may promote viral reactivation or which outcome may be influenced by viral reactivation.",

In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, herpesviruses, mainly HSV1 and hCMV, may be frequently detected from either upper or lower respiratory tract samples [6, 7]. It has been suggested that the presence of HSV1 in the respiratory samples of ICU patients correlates with the duration of tracheal intubation [5]. The detection of HSV1 in the lower respiratory tract of ICU patients is reported with a variable frequency, from 5 to 64 % depending on the population and the diagnostic method used [2, 8, 9]. Moreover, it is not always clear whether the demonstration of HSV1 DNA in lower respiratory tract samples of non-immunocompromised ventilated patients is the consequence of a contamination from mouth or throat or is the result of local viral reactivation [4, 6, 7, 10]. Some studies showed that there was a significant association between an HSV1 viral load >100.000 copies/ml of BAL and admission to the ICU (p < 0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) and death (p < 0.01) [5, 11, 12].",

Only few patients with laboratory confirmed herpesviruses infection were treated with acyclovir/ganciclovir and despite the treatment they died; however, the small number of observations and the lack of virological monitoring does not allow us to tray any conclusion. Several immunological parameters were significantly impaired in the group of patients ICU died. In particular, a clear reduction in circulating lymphocytes was evident in this group when compared to the group of patients discharged from ICU. The cell reduction involves all lymphocytes populations: T (CD3+), B (CD19+) and NK cells (CD3CD16/56+). These data can account for both extravasation of cells that are recruited in inflamed organs and for cell apoptosis that typically affects hyper-activated lymphocytes. To evaluate the influence on ICU mortality of viral coinfections, patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the presence of influenza and/or herpetic infection. ANOVA analysis showed no statistically significant difference in ICU mortality. In the group (n = 10) with presence of both infections (herpes and influenza), ICU mortality was 40 %; in patients with only influenza positivity (n = 9), ICU mortality was 22.3 %, while in patients with only herpetic positivity (n = 7), it was 71.4 %; ICU mortality was 21.5 % in patients with no one viral positivity (n = 28) (p = 0.30). Even if these differences are not significant, these data add further evidence to the association of ICU mortality with herpesviruses infection, whereas ICU mortality in patients with only influenza infection is similar to that of patients negative for both viruses.",

The mortality for this pathology is still high, despite the implementation of specific therapies in recent years. In patients with ARDS, bacterial infections are prevalent; however, there are no enough studies that highlight the presence of viral etiology. Among respiratory viruses, influenza A viruses, above all of the subtype (H1N1)pdm09, may be associated with ARDS, as it became evident during and after the last influenza pandemic. Some studies report the frequent presence of herpesviruses in respiratory samples of patients with ARDS [1\u20137, 34]. However, the significance of this positivity is still debated.",

Instead, two other patients, influenza negative, were positive in the BAL for RhV and AdV, respectively. This study confirms that influenza viruses, mainly the H1N1 pandemic subtype, are frequently related to ARDS requiring ICU hospitalization, whereas other common respiratory viruses showed to be involved only sporadically. In 10 of 19 influenza-positive patients, also the DNA of one or more herpesvirus was present in the BAL, whereas no coinfection with herpesviruses was found in the patients with RhV or AdV infection. Thus, in BAL of 7 patients, DNA of herpesviruses alone was found. These data indicate that in 28/54 patients viral infections seem to be involved in ARDS. However, the number of respiratory virus-positive patients could be underestimated because of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the ICU hospitalization. In addition, this study concerned the common respiratory viruses, whereas others like bocavirus and mimivirus were not included. Moreover, it is possible that other already unknown viruses exist. Data on other causative agents as bacteria or fungi have not been considered in this study. In addition to the detection of a direct viral cause of ARDS, this study highlights the existence of some interaction among different viruses and also among viruses, immune status and outcome of ARDS. In fact, a significant correlation was observed between influenza infection and herpesviruses reactivation, demonstrated by the detection of the viral DNA in the BAL. This observation could suggest that the respiratory mucosa damage caused by influenza virus replication can trigger herpesviruses reactivation. As regards each herpesvirus searched in the respiratory tract of the patients included in this study, EBV was the more frequently detected (43 %), whereas both hCMV and HSV1 were present in the respiratory tract of 28 % of patients. However, in BAL EBV DNA was found in 5 patients only (9 %), and hCMV DNA and HSV1 DNA were found in 7 (13 %) and 9 (17 %) patients, respectively. The frequency and DNA load of HSV1 in BAL samples were higher than that of hCMV and EBV, and in 6 patients, it was higher than 100,000 copies/ml, a value that is reported in the literature [5] as related to higher mortality. These results are in agreement with those of Tachikawa [35] who reported that reactivation of HSV1 was predominantly observed in intubated patients regardless of their immune status, whereas reactivation of hCMV and EBV was rare in immunocompetent patients.",

In particular, the highest ICU mortality was observed among patients with hCMV reactivation, followed by those with HSV1 reactivation and then by those with EBV reaction. As regards the role of each herpesvirus here considered, the small number of data for each virus does not allow to draw a definitive conclusion. Altogether, it seems that EBV may be involved in ARDS like the two other herpesviruses, with a slightly lower frequency. Furthermore, the data analyzed in this study indicate that ICU mortality was significantly related to an impaired immunophenotype as patients with poor outcome showed severe lymphopenia, affecting in particular T (CD3+) cells, since the first days of ICU hospitalization.",
