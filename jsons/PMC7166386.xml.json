HRV is one of the most important viral agents of acute respiratory tract infections and has been frequently detected in upper and lower respiratory tract infections using modern molecular detection methods. Previous studies suggest that HRV is associated with an extensive range of human respiratory disorders including the common cold, viral bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Gern et al., 1997; Rakes et al., 1999; Seemungal et al., 2000; Johnston et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2008;]. A recent study also showed that HRV was the most prevalent agent associated with severe bronchiolitis in a population of preterm infants [Miller et al., 2012].",

Classical HRV consists of more than 100 distinct serotypes. Until recently, on the basis of gene sequence analysis, HRV was classified into three species, HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B, and the newly designated HRV\u2010C [Lau et al., 2007; McErlean et al., 2007; Bizzintino et al., 2011]. Recent studies have suggested that the illness severity differs among HRV species [Khetsuriani et al., 2008; Calvo et al., 2010] and that HRV\u2010C could be associated with more severe clinical illnesses, including wheezing, lower respiratory infections and asthmatic exacerbations, than HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010B [Lau et al., 2007; Khetsuriani et al., 2008; Han et al., 2009; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009; Piralla et al., 2009; Bizzintino et al., 2011]. However, some reports have indicated that HRV\u2010C has been detected in healthy individuals without any acute respiratory symptoms [Calvo et al., 2010] and that there is no difference between the clinical presentations of patients infected with the different HRV species [Iwane et al., 2011]. Therefore, the clinical significance of HRV\u2010C remains controversial and needs to be addressed further.",

In Hong Kong, a subtropical city, infections caused by HRV, including HRV\u2010C, occur throughout the year, although a higher incidence has been observed during the fall and winter months for all three HRV species [Lau et al., 2007, 2009]. One study suggested that HRV, including HRV\u2010C, could be found throughout the year but that it predominates during the rainy season in the pediatric population in Thailand [Linsuwanon et al., 2009]. In Kenya, there was no clear seasonal pattern of occurrence for any species [Onyango et al., 2012], while the number of HRV\u2010C infections peaked in early winter (December) and late spring (April) in Lanzhou, China [Jin et al., 2009]. A recent 21\u2010year study suggested that HRV\u2010C was found most commonly during the winter months [Linder et al., 2013]. In this study, HRV was detected throughout the year and peaked in the winter and spring, and the HRV\u2010C prevalence peaked in early winter and late autumn. These data suggest that HRV may follow different epidemiological patterns in different regions and that different genotypes may present in different seasons.",

In a recent study involving patients from Thailand, other respiratory viruses were co\u2010detected in approximately 38% of the HRV\u2010positive patients; of these patients, 40% were co\u2010infected with HRV\u2010C and 36% were infected with HRV/RSV [Linsuwanon et al., 2009]. RSV and HRV were the viruses identified most frequently in mixed infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis [Richard et al., 2008]. Of those with HRV in the present study, 53.0% were co\u2010detected with other respiratory viruses and 41.1% with HRV\u2010C. RSV (47.7%) was the most common additional respiratory virus detected in the HRV\u2010positive patients. These findings were in agreement with a report from Thailand. Children with HRV mono\u2010infection versus HRV co\u2010detection with other viruses had similar clinical courses, comparable to those in some US studies [Iwane et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011]. One study suggested co\u2010infections were not associated with a particular HRV species or with severity [Lauinger et al., 2013]. No significant differences in the clinical severity were found between patients with HRV single infection and those with HRV co\u2010detections. No significant differences in median age, gender, symptomatology (fever, wheezing, cyanosis, and crackles), supplemental oxygen, and time hospitalized were observed between children infected with HRV\u2010C only and those with HRV\u2010C co\u2010detections.",

            "text": "Previous studies have suggested that HRV\u2010C might play a role in severe clinical disease. HRV\u2010C was present in the majority of children with acute asthma and was associated with more severe asthma [Bizzintino et al., 2011]. In another study by Miller et al. [2009], children with HRV\u2010C were more likely to require supplemental oxygen than those with HRV\u2010A. Wheezing episodes were also more common among individuals with HRV\u2010C and HRV\u2010A infection than among those with HRV\u2010B infection [Lau et al., 2009]. It was found that HRV\u2010C was associated with respiratory infections with few symptoms and could trigger apparently life\u2010threatening events in young infants [Calvo et al., 2009]. Another study suggested that HRV\u2010C was associated with more severe disease in children <3 years of age [Lauinger et al., 2013]. However, some reports found no differences in the clinical characteristics among hospitalized enrolled patients positive for HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B, or HRV\u2010C, including wheezing [Fry et al., 2011; Iwane et al., 2011]. In the present study, no significant differences were observed in clinical symptoms, signs, and clinical diagnoses including wheezing, supplemental oxygen and acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia among the three HRV genotypes. With the absence of a control group in both the current and previous studies, it is difficult to evaluate the exact role that HRV\u2010C plays in acute lower respiratory tract infection.",

The majority of HRV\u2010positive individuals were \u226436 months old, and HRV\u2010C was mainly epidemic during early winter and late autumn. The results do not support those of previous studies, which showed differences in the clinical symptoms, signs, and clinical diagnoses among the three HRV genotypes.
