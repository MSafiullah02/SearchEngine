            "text": "Over the years, there has been considerable confusion regarding the defi nition of sepsis, with terms such as \"infection\" and \"sepsis\" often being used interchangeably. While obviously related, these elements are not exact synonyms; sepsis is the host response to an infection by an invading microorganism, be it virus, bacteria, or fungus. In 1992, as the links between infl ammation and sepsis were becoming increasingly clear, a consensus conference on sepsis defi nitions introduced the term SIRS (systemic infl ammatory response syndrome) in an attempt to clarify and simplify the defi nitions of sepsis [1] . A patient was classifi ed as having SIRS if he/she had at least two of four parameters (temperature >38 or <36\u00b0 C; heart rate >90 beats/min; respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PCO 2 < 32 mmHg; white blood cell count >12 or <4 \u00d7 10 9 /l). Sepsis was defi ned as SIRS plus infection. However, it soon became apparent that nearly all intensive care unit (ICU) patients meet the SIRS criteria at some point during their ICU stay [2, 3] , making this approach too sensitive to be useful in diagnosing sepsis [4] .",

The participants at this meeting agreed that the SIRS concept was not helpful and should no longer be used per se, but that the SIRS criteria be incorporated into a longer list of signs of sepsis that could be employed to support a diagnosis of sepsis. This list includes biologic signs of infl ammation (e.g., increased serum concentrations of C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin), hemodynamic parameters (e.g., increased cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance [SVR], low oxygen extraction ratio), signs of altered tissue perfusion (e.g., altered skin perfusion, reduced urine output), and signs of organ dysfunction (e.g., increased urea and creatinine, low platelet count or other coagulation abnormalities, 1 hyperbilirubinemia). The participants also suggested that as the defi nitions did not allow for precise characterization and staging of patients with sepsis, a clinically useful staging system that could stratify patients by both their baseline risk of an adverse outcome and their potential to respond to therapy was needed. Building on a system that had emerged at the Fifth Toronto Sepsis Roundtable held in Toronto, Canada, in 2000 [6] , the sepsis defi nitions conference participants, therefore, proposed the PIRO system [5] , which can classify patients on the basis of their predisposing conditions, the nature and extent of the infection, the nature and magnitude of the host response, and the degree of concomitant organ dysfunction.",

The TNM system classifi es malignant tumors based on descriptors of the extent of the primary tumor (T), on the presence, absence, and extent of metastases to regional lymph nodes (N), and on the presence or absence of distant metastases (M) ( Table 1) . Each patient with a tumor will, therefore, receive a specifi c classifi cation, e.g., T1, N0, M0, for that tumor. TNM classifi cations are then grouped into stages, usually from I to IV, which provide valuable prognostic information. Importantly, staging systems in cancer stratify patients not only according to prognosis, but also according to the probability that they will respond to a particular therapy.",

All these factors individually and collectively can impact on outcome, modifying both the disease process and the approach to therapy. Recent advances in genetic techniques have enabled several factors associated with an increased risk of infection and of mortality from sepsis to be identifi ed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, microsatellites, insertion and deletion polymorphisms are all forms of genetic variation that can characterize an individual's risk for sepsis, organ dysfunction, or death [9] . Most genetic traits associated with severe infection are associated with defects in innate immune responses. For example, a polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 gene, the TNF-2 allele, is associated with increased serum levels of TNF and a greater risk of mortality from septic shock [10] . A polymorphism within intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene (IL-1RN * 2) has been associated with reduced IL-1ra production and increased mortality rates [11] . Recently, polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 1 gene were reported to be associated with increased susceptibility to organ dysfunction, death, and Gram-positive infection in sepsis [12] . Sex differences are another area of interest with several studies reporting that women are less likely to develop sepsis than men [13, 14] . However, women who do develop sepsis, particularly older women, may have worse outcomes than men [15, 16] . Studies have also suggested racial differences in susceptibility to and outcomes from sepsis [17] , and older patients are known to be at an increased risk of developing sepsis and succumbing to it [18] . Certain chronic diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as chronic use of immunosuppressant medication may also predispose to sepsis and a worse outcome. Moreover, each factor may have a different impact on the other three PIRO components [5] . For example, chronic immunosuppression may increase a person's risk of infection, but may decrease the magnitude of that person's infl ammatory response. Undoubtedly these are complex relationships with multiple confounding factors and further research is needed to clearly defi ne which factors should be taken into account when considering the impact of predisposition on prognosis, to determine which carry most weight, and to identify how knowledge of increased risks can be translated into improved clinical outcomes. Advances in genetics technology now enable investigators to create glass slides (chips) with minute quantities of short, gene-specifi c nucleotides. These gene-specifi c probe nucleotides, ideally one for each gene in the genome, are arrayed onto the chip surface to produce a DNA microarray. These can be used to generate an expression profi le, the transcriptome, for the cell or tissue of interest. Genomics, and the broader fi eld of proteomics, is likely to be increasingly used in routine patient management in hospitals of the future and will facilitate the task of assessing predisposition.",

In terms of source, for example, infections of the urinary tract are usually less severe than intra-abdominal or pulmonary infections. In the Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) trial [20] , patients with urinary tract infections as a source of severe sepsis had a 28-day all-cause mortality of 21% compared with patients with a pulmonary source of sepsis who had a mortality rate of 34% (p < .01). The size of the inoculum, virulence, and sensitivity of the infecting organisms are also important in determining outcomes. In the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study, infection with Pseudomonas spp. was independently associated with increased ICU mortality (OR: 1.62 [95% CI 1.09-2.42], p = 0.017) [16] . In a multicenter study from China, Gram-positive bacterial infection and invasive fungal infections were risk factors for hospital mortality [21] . However, classifying the relative importance of infections on outcome can be diffi cult. Cohen et al. [22] recently generated specifi c risk codes for the six most common infections: bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections. For each infection site and organism, a two-digit code was generated according to the mortality rate associated with that infection (from 1: \u22645% to 4: >30%), and the level of evidence available to support the mortality risk (level A representing evidence from more than fi ve studies with greater than 100 patients, through to level E where there was insuffi cient evidence from case reports). This Grading System for Site and Severity of Infection (GSSSI) needs to be validated, but could be a useful means of characterizing the risks associated with infections caused by various organisms in different sites.",

Various approaches have been proposed, including the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms or the degree of elevation of biological markers, such as procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, but as yet, none of the suggested markers is specifi c for sepsis. Importantly, the initial theory that sepsis was simply an uncontrolled infl ammatory response and could be treated by blocking or removing any or several of the proinfl ammatory cytokines has been replaced by the realization that the infl ammatory response is a normal and necessary response to infection, and interrupting that response at any point may do more harm than good. Indeed, the early hyperinfl ammatory phase of sepsis is soon replaced by a hypoinfl ammatory state. The host response to infection thus varies between patients and with time in the same patient [25] . This differentiation is important for therapeutic decisions, as antiinfl ammatory therapies may be harmful if given to a patient who is already in the hypoinfl ammatory phase; such a patient may benefi t rather from a proinfl ammatory therapy to boost their immune system. As with genomics, technological advances now enable multiple markers to be assessed simultaneously from small blood samples. This approach could provide clinicians with an immune profi le for individual patients. Again, considerable research is needed to indentify which markers should be included on such microarrays. Furthermore, the optimal set of biologic markers for 1 any patient may depend on the therapy being proposed [5] . For example, an indicator of dysregulation of the coagulation system might be more valuable when deciding whether or not to give drotrecogin alfa (activated), whereas a marker of adrenal dysfunction might be more useful for determining whether to give hydrocortisone.",

The degree of organ involvement can be assessed with various scoring systems, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) [27] . This system uses parameters that are routinely available in all ICUs to assess the degree of dysfunction for six organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, coagulation, neurologic, and hepatic, with a scale of 0 (no dysfunction) to 4 for each organ. Importantly, organ dysfunction can be recorded for each organ separately or a composite score can be calculated. Thus with repeated scores, a dynamic picture of the effects of sepsis on individual or global organ dysfunction can be developed. Sequential assessment of the SOFA score during the fi rst few days of ICU admission has been shown to be a good indicator of prognosis, with an increase in SOFA score during the fi rst 48 h in the ICU predicting a mortality rate of at least 50% [28] . Levy et al. reported that early improvement in cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory function from baseline to day 1 was signifi cantly related to survival [29] . Continued improvement in cardiovascular function before the start of day 2 and start of day 3 was associated with further improvement in survival for patients who improved compared with those who worsened.",

For each of the four PIRO components, multivariate analysis was used to select variables signifi cantly associated with hospital mortality, which were then weighted and allocated points. The authors felt it was not possible to separate host response from the resulting organ dysfunction, so they combined these two components. For predisposition, the fi nal variables were age, location of patient prior to ICU admission, length of stay before ICU admission, certain comorbidities (cancer, cirrhosis, acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome [AIDS]), and cardiac arrest as the reason for ICU admission; for infection, the variables were nosocomial infection, respiratory infection, and infections by Candida species or other fungi; for response/organ dysfunction, the variables were renal or coagulation dysfunction, and failure of the cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, coagulation, or central nervous systems. The authors suggested that, although further prospective validation is needed, the proposed SAPS III PIRO system could be used to stratify patients at or shortly after ICU admission to enable better selection of management according to the risk of death [30] .",

A four-point score was thus developed, with one point for each component. Mortality increased with increasing score: A score of 0 was associated with a mortality rate of 9.8%, increasing to 93.3% for patients with a score of 4.

Results from studies of proposed new interventions in severe sepsis have largely been disappointing with few demonstrating any positive effect on outcomes. One of the possible reasons for the multiple \"failed\" trials is that the groups of patients studied have been too heterogeneous and that global results have masked any potential benefi t in specifi c subgroups of patients [32] . Better targeting of proposed interventions by better characterization of septic patients with the PIRO system may lead to better outcomes. Improved classifi cation of septic patients using the PIRO system may, thus, facilitate the development and evaluation of clinical trials of sepsis therapies and will also encourage further study into the pathophysiology and epidemiology of sepsis. Importantly, just as the TNM system is adjusted to specifi c cancers [33] , so the PIRO system will need to be adapted to fi t specifi c patient 1 groups, local practice, purpose (e.g., clinical trial inclusion, prognostication, patient management), or proposed therapies. For example, if the planned intervention is an anticoagulant then evidence of coagulopathy is likely to be more relevant than presence of respiratory failure, while if considering hemodialysis, the presence and degree of renal failure are likely to be most pertinent [24] .",
