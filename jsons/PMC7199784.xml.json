            "text": "Our data show a lack of productive NiV replication in EFBs. The lack of detectable viral RNA in both the swabs and the tissues across all time points suggests that the bats did not shed virus nor was viral replication detected in any of the tested tissue types (Table 1); viral replication and shedding are qualities associated with natural hosts [36, 37]. Back-titrations of the viral inoculum confirmed that the EFBs received a 105 TCID50 dose NiV, which is higher than the 5 \u00d7 104 TCID50 NiV challenge that resulted in productive viral replication in guinea pigs and Pteropus bats [19]. A lack of detectable virus in any EFB tissue samples 3 days postinoculation suggests that the virus was rapidly cleared; Halpin et al [13] report that henipavirus inoculum is cleared within 48 hours. The bats did not seroconvert against NiV G in the given timeframe of 28 days, although 1 individual had a slight increase in mean fluorescence intensity at 21 and 28 DPI, which may have increased above our cutoff if given more time (Figure 4). Previous studies have demonstrated that EFB cells are permissive to Ebola virus, but experimentally challenged bats did not shed virus or support productive replication [38, 39] despite compatibility between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and the host receptor, NPC1 [40]. These data suggest that productive viral replication is blocked by a mechanism other than compatibility with the host receptor. Likewise, van Doremalen et al [41] reported a lack of efficient viral replication in EFBs when challenged with bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus WIV1 despite in vitro receptor compatibility. Given the lack of unique variation in either EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 relative to compatible host ephrin sequences (Figure 2), it is likely that NiV virus replication is not inhibited by a lack of binding between NiV G and the EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, nor the subsequent F-mediated activation and membrane fusion process. Indeed, NiV F and G can mediate productive cell-cell fusion in a variety of different mammalian species including several that are negative or refractory to productive infection, such as rabbit and mouse [32, 42].",

However, follow-up studies to determine the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication in EFBs would be valuable in elucidating the evolution of NiV in its natural reservoirs. Few controlled studies have been conducted using bats as a model organism, and, as such, there are few reagents commercially available for studying the immunobiology of bats in response to viral infection. Further research is urgently needed to expand upon the current capacity to conduct research in bats, particularly when considering that 5 of 9 viruses associated with the World Health Organization\u2019s Blueprint list of priority diseases [1] likely originated as bat-borne zoonoses.",

Although it is important to consider broader ecological characteristics in determining potential for a host species to contribute to virus spillover and maintenance, understanding the limitations to reservoir potential on a mechanistic level for high-impact pathogens such as NiV would further improve predictive modeling work. Testing viral entry and replication through in vitro assays are important first steps in determining host potential, but this should be followed by in vivo experiments when possible.",
