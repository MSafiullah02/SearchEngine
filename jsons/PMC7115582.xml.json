            "text": "Human influenza A and B viruses cause the annual influenza epidemics and sporadic pandemics associated with high fatality rate [1]. The viral envelope contains two glycoproteins with a crucial role in virus replication. The hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for initial attachment of the virus to sialylated cell surface glycans, and fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus particle [2]. The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) catalyzes release of newly formed virions at the end of the viral life cycle. Currently available influenza virus blockers are the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine [3]. The latter two are rarely used nowadays because of global viral resistance against them [4]. The increasing awareness of potential oseltamivir resistance [5,6] advocates the need for new anti-influenza medications. Clinical trials are ongoing for a few HA-targeting approaches, i.e. the fusion inhibitor arbidol and diverse broadly neutralizing anti-HA antibodies [3]. In addition, the possibility to target a host factor involved in HA functioning is tested with the HA maturation inhibitor nitazoxanide and a receptor-destroying sialidase enzyme, besides various concepts in the preclinical stage [7].",

In this context, antiviral glycopeptide analogues seem particularly relevant since they often display broad activity against influenza plus some other emerging viruses. Derivatives of teicoplanin or related antibiotics were reported to inhibit, among others, influenza virus [9]; coronaviruses [10] including SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [11]; Ebola pseudovirus [12]; HIV [13]; or hepatitis C virus [14]. Our focus of the last years was to investigate the structure-activity relationship and mechanism of action for influenza virus. We reported lipophilic derivatives of ristocetin aglycon modified on the N-terminal part of the molecule, which proved to be strong inhibitors of influenza virus replication in cell culture [15]. Mechanistic studies with the lead compound demonstrated that it interferes with influenza virus endocytosis [16]. Its favorable selectivity index encouraged us to prepare a series of analogues to gain further insight into structure activity relationships [17,18]. The outstanding antiviral properties were lost in analogues containing teicoplanin aglycon or pseudoaglycon, meaning that minor structural differences between the aglycon of teicoplanin and that of ristocetin, have major impact on antiviral activity [19].",

These derivatives contain a sugar unit carrying two n-octyl chains, and this lipophilic auxiliary is attached to teicoplanin pseudoaglycon through a tetraethylene glycol chain and a triazole ring (1a and 1b, Fig. 1\n). Although the antiviral mode of action of 1a and 1b remains to be elucidated, we observed that these dually octylated teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives inhibit influenza virus-induced hemagglutination, suggesting that they interfere with the binding interaction between the viral HA and sialylated host cell receptors. We also found that the lipophilic side chains in these molecules are essential for anti-influenza virus activity, since changing these octyl chains to methyl groups (1c) completely abolished the antiviral effect [20]. Unfortunately, the strong activity of 1a and 1b was accompanied by high cytotoxicity, while the inactive and less amphiphilic 1c was only moderately toxic.",

The activity oddly correlated to the structure, since it disappeared and then reappeared by increasing the length of the lipophilic alkyl chains. Changes in cytotoxicity, however, were more consistent and indicated that the addition of longer alkyl substituents resulted in higher cytotoxicity. Although compounds 2a and 2d showed excellent inhibitory activity against influenza virus, their selectivity indices were unfavorable [21].

We envisioned the application of maleimide chemistry in combination with azide-alkyne click chemistry, to produce three sets of teicoplanin derivatives equipped with two lipophilic substituents similarly as in 1a and 1b.

This might be enhanced by the simple structure of the alkyl chains, which could facilitate insertion of these molecules into biological membranes. In our previous work [21] we attached two very bulky substituents (a perbenzylated disaccharide and a calix[4]arene carrying tert-butyl-substituents) to the same pseudoaglycon (2i and 2j). Calculated logP values for these compounds indicated higher lipophilicity than e.g. the n-hexadecyl or n-octyl derivatives 2a and 2d. These derivatives did not produce profound cytotoxic effect, supporting our hypothesis that cytotoxicity is determined by the combination of the lipophilicity and bulkiness of the substituents. It needs to be mentioned here, that in the A2 components of teicoplanin the \u00df-d-glucosamine on the D-ring is N-acylated by similarly simple acyl chains, yet these compounds seem to be harmless to mammalian cells. Therefore, the overall lipophilicity of the molecules may also influence cytotoxicity.",

The optimal length of alkyl substituents, which is somewhat dependent on the structure of the linker, is usually equivalent to 6\u201310 methylene groups. If the side chain carries two alkyl groups, reduced length might be enough, e. g. double butyl substitution. The incorporation of longer alkyl groups (>14 carbon atoms, Series 4) might also lead to active compounds, however most of these proved to be highly cytotoxic. The latter was even noted for some compounds with the optimum side chain lengths (e.g. 8\u201310). Reducing the cytotoxicity with preservation of antiviral activity was achieved by incorporation of the tetraethylene glycol linker. In some cases, this modification led to an improvement, while other derivatives became less active, probably due to a loss of required lipophilicity.",

Nevertheless, these analogues seem to display a similar relationship between lipophilicity, anti-influenza virus activity and cytotoxicity, as the alkyl substituted compounds. Compounds containing one aromatic ring are usually not very active nor cytotoxic. Two aromatic rings seem to boost antiviral activity because of increased lipophilicity, but cytotoxicity also becomes prominent. Interestingly, the two compounds that carried numerous aromatic rings in the form of a highly bulky, lipo/hydrophilic side chain were effective against one or more influenza virus strains without causing serious cytotoxicity.",

As we have demonstrated, high activity goes hand in hand with high toxicity in many instances. Still, our study proved that once an active lead compound has been identified, it is possible to diminish its cytotoxicity by applying appropriate structural adjustments. Besides the modifications described here, there are unlimited variations that could lead to derivatives with excellent biological profiles. Moreover, as we have seen, the promising antiviral activity is not limited to influenza virus since some of our derivatives also displayed activity against human coronavirus. This makes this class of lipoglycopeptides a relevant class for further investigation [27].",
