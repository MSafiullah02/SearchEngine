These artificial airways provide direct, unobstructed lower respiratory tract access to maximize ventilation [4\u20137], expedite oxygen entry, and facilitate secretion management [6, 7]. Given the anatomical location of a tracheostomy and the shared pathway of the respiratory and alimentary systems, the tracheostomy may have unintended, even adverse consequences. Despite their benefits, it is often debated whether tracheostomies increase the risk of upper airway complications [2, 8, 9]. One such complication is dysphagia (swallowing impairment) [10, 11].",

Dysphagia, if unmanaged, can lead to adverse medical outcomes including respiratory complications, nutritional compromise, and even death [14\u201316]. Swallowing is a complex sensorimotor process [17] which, when functioning optimally, ensures safe passage of the oral bolus into the lower deglutitive tract. Disruption to the upper airway by way of a tracheostomy may lead to physiological and/or biomechanical changes to the swallow, thereby increasing dysphagia risk [9, 18]. There are several posited explanations as to why dysphagia occurs in these patients, including reduced sensory input, laryngeal structure disuse atrophy, and subglottic air pressure reduction. In an effort to wean the patients from the artificial airway, tracheostomy modifications are often employed as management strategies [19].",

Among many factors, determinants that precede tracheostomy weaning may include improved respiratory and/or ventilator capability, secretion management, cough effectiveness, and level of consciousness [20, 21]. Various management strategies to assist with tracheostomy weaning are available to clinicians. These often include cannula size reduction, fenestration, cuff pressure reduction (deflation), and/or partial or total occlusion of the artificial airway [3, 18]. Often when these methods are employed, improvements in swallowing physiology have been reported [22] particularly with secretion clearance, cough, and airway protection [23\u201325]. The true reason behind these changes have been debated given the multifactorial nature of the patient\u2019s condition. For example, some attribute these swallowing improvements to the overall improvement of the patient\u2019s health rather than due to the tracheostomy modification itself [11, 26, 27]. While tracheostomy modifications are widely employed to assist with weaning, consensus on whether they improve swallow physiology has yet to be reached. As a result, we conducted a systematic review in order to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence on swallow physiology following tracheostomy modification in adults.",

Swallowing instrumentation included, but was not limited to, videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). We defined aspiration as the entry of ingested material below the level of the vocal folds [30]. For terms related to the artificial airway, we defined tracheotomy as a surgical opening in the trachea [6, 31], whereas tracheostomy is the temporary maintenance of that opening by virtue of a tracheostomy tube placement [6, 31]. Tracheostomy modifications included alterations to one or more of the following: (1) tracheostomy tube dimension, material and/or fenestration, (2) cuff status, and/or (3) occlusion status (including but not limited to digital occlusion or one-way speaking valve placement). The tracheostomy cuff (if present) was the inflatable band located on the distal cannula with cuff status referring to inflation (cuff up) or deflation (cuff down) [4, 6]. During our analyses, we defined functional swallowing improvement as facilitative changes to swallowing parameters leading to a safer or more efficient swallow.",

We manually searched for citations in 11 journals: Archives of Surgery, Canadian Journal of Surgery, Chest, Critical Care Medicine, Dysphagia, Head & Neck, Intensive Care Medicine, International Journal of Speech Pathology, Journal of Otolaryngology, Laryngoscope, and the Head & Neck Journal. Our searches also included nine grey literature repositories: Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Service, Proquest Dissertations, Theses Canada Portal, Canadian Best Practices Portal, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Canadian Medical Association (CMA Infobase), and Clinical Practice Guidelines. Using the accepted English articles, we performed forward and backward citation chasing [32]. Specifically, we reviewed study titles citing the accepted articles for possible inclusion as well as their respective reference lists [32]. We then applied our eligibility criteria to these citations. We iterated this process on the new articles. A health sciences research librarian designed our search strategy, which was subsequently peer reviewed by an independent information scientist. Our searches included key terms germane to our study objective, including \u201ctracheotomy\u201d or \u201ctracheostomy\u201d or \u201ctrach*\u201d and \u201cdysphagia\u201d, \u201cswallow*\u201d, \u201cswallowing disorders\u201d, and \u201cdeglutition\u201d.

In contrast, one study reported that cuff status was a significant predictor of aspiration [46]. In the single study that compared cuff inflation to a one-way speaking valve condition [44], penetration\u2013aspiration scores lowered significantly in the valve condition, but greater residue was measured in the oral cavity, on the pharyngeal wall, and along the cricopharyngeus across all bolus textures. In the same study, when comparing cuff deflation or a cuffless tracheostomy tube to the valve, significantly lower penetration\u2013aspiration scores were reported in the valve condition for liquid boluses, without a significant effect on residue.",

Of these, three studies [42, 43, 45] utilized digital occlusion, speaking valve, tracheostomy capping, or an unspecified occlusion method and yielded equivocal results. One study [45] found significantly lower aspiration\u2013penetration rates in an occluded condition (unspecified), whereas another study [43] reported that aspiration rates remained unchanged regardless of occlusion. In the third study [42], aspiration rates decreased across three occlusion conditions (i.e. digital occlusion, speaking valve, tracheostomy cap); however, the differences between occlusion type and their respective aspiration rates were not statistically significant. Three studies [39, 47, 48] compared a speaking valve condition to no occlusion. Two [41, 48] reported aspiration rates reduced after valve placement though this was only tested statistically in one study [48]. While the third study [47] reported valve placement had no significant effect on aspiration, the authors did find valve placement significantly reduced penetration rates and residue.",

Specific findings included: increasing cuff pressure [41] delayed swallow initiation while decreasing laryngeal elevation and submental muscle amplitude and cuff deflation [44] significantly increased some duration measures (i.e. pharyngeal transit time, anterior hyoid excursion duration) while shortening cricopharyngeal opening duration. Both studies [41, 44] reported that cuff deflation resulted in significantly greater anterior hyoid excursion. Tracheostomy occlusion, whether it was valve placement [44, 47] or an open versus closed tracheostomy condition [40, 45] did not change quantitative measurements significantly (Table 4, Fig. 4).",

            "text": "This systematic review confirms that when comparing tracheostomy modification conditions, swallowing outcomes are highly variable. Our review included 10 studies [39\u201348] that compared a variety of tracheostomy modifications, including (1) cuff alterations (cuff presence and/or absence and/or inflation and/or deflation), (2) occlusion methods (digital occlusion and/or one-way speaking valve and/or total occlusion), and/or (3) a combination of conditions. Study sample sizes ranged from 11 [40] to 40 [42] patients with diagnostic heterogeneity both within and across studies. Of the 10 included studies, five [43, 44, 46\u201348] used VFSS to measure swallowing outcomes with four [39, 42, 45, 47] using FEES. Other measurement methods included manometry [40, 45], EMG [41], and accelerometry [41]. When swallowing impairment was reported, two studies [44, 45] utilized a psychometrically validated tool (PAS), while seven used binary descriptions (e.g. presence/absence) [39, 42, 43, 48], study-specific scales [44, 46], or a combination of methods [47]. For quantified measurements (i.e. pressures, durations, distance), all [40, 41, 44, 45] but one [47] reported specific measurement metrics. Given the limitations in the primary studies, including bias risk, small sample sizes with heterogeneous patient diagnoses, and the wide range of assessment methods, the evidence is inconclusive.",

Given the variability inherent in the included studies, we synthesized our results descriptively. All studies were case series [39\u201348]. Many did not report on their patient sampling methods [39\u201341, 43, 44, 47] or the patient inclusion/exclusion criteria [39, 42\u201344]. As a result, it was difficult to determine how their sample was derived rendering an inability to judge the potential effect of patient selection on study outcomes. The majority of the studies in our review were unclear in regard to their assessor blinding [39\u201342, 44, 45, 47, 48] and additionally, some studies [39, 43, 44, 48] did not present all outcomes. As a result, our ability to gauge the effect of assessor bias on outcomes is also limited. Despite these shortcomings, all studies [39\u201348] provided clear operational outcome definitions and accounted for patient attrition affording a clear understanding of the targeted outcomes for the patient sample. In addition, the two studies with lowest bias risk had only one domain ranked as unclear [41, 45].",

            "text": "Diagnoses, illness severity, tracheostomy duration, and modification duration likely play a role in swallowing outcomes. Two studies had homogeneous patient samples [41, 45] and of those, one reported on tracheostomy tube placement durations [45]. The within- and across-study heterogeneity evident in the areas of patient diagnoses, tracheostomy tube placement durations, and other airway management practices likely played a role in the equivocal and, at times, the divergent findings of this review. This diversity, when coupled with very small sample sizes, can increase a study\u2019s risk for underpowering, calling into question whether enough data were collected in order to render a substantiated conclusion. Not only did patient diagnostic heterogeneity [39, 40, 42\u201344, 46\u201348] and small sample sizes [40, 41, 43, 44, 46\u201348] likely play a role in the outcomes, but only a few studies reported the details for patients\u2019 airway management (e.g. weaning procedure or duration of tracheostomy) [41, 42, 46, 48] or baseline swallowing measures [42, 44\u201346], making it difficult to assess whether these variables may have influenced study outcomes. For example, within a single study [43], tracheostomy tube duration ranged from eight to 546 days, with the range of all included studies from five [44] to 546 days [43]. Only three studies reported on the duration for which the patient was subjected to the tracheostomy modification condition [39, 44, 45], making it difficult to determine whether time could be a factor in the study outcomes. Other factors relevant to tracheostomy weaning and the use of tracheostomy modifications include pulmonary performance data. With very few studies reporting on this specifically [39, 40, 42\u201348], only one study [41] reported pulmonary variables at the time of tracheostomy modification. Given the effect of pulmonary performance on weaning in general and on research study outcomes specifically, future work should include pulmonary measures in order to provide users a framework by which to interpret and apply study findings.",

            "text": "In addition to limiting the ability to conduct meta-analyses, the methodological variability by which swallowing physiology was interpreted and the limited information in the primary studies regarding the tracheostomy tube itself, also impacted our ability to determine the effect of tracheostomy modifications, if any. Two studies [44, 45] used a psychometrically validated method of rating swallowing impairment, specifically, the PAS. Both of these studies reported functional improvement in swallowing on most conditions. The remaining seven studies [39, 42\u201344, 46\u201348] defined swallowing impairment using methods and/or scales unique to their specific study. While half of these studies [39, 42, 47, 48] reported improved swallowing, whether these findings are valid or reliable is difficult to ascertain. Interestingly, all studies conducting quantitative swallowing measurements had clear directions regarding functional swallow change. Specifically, cuff deflation led to the improvement of most swallowing parameters [41, 44] with tracheostomy occlusion (regardless of method or type) [40, 44, 45, 47] rendered no significant measurement change. Other independent variables which have the potential to affect the swallow include tracheostomy tube type and its associated diameter, particularly when considering cuff alterations (e.g. inflation or deflation). In clinical practice, the tracheostomy tube type and size used is often dependent upon patient-specific parameters including sex, trachea size, and/or pulmonary needs. Pressures in the upper airway (e.g. in the cuff) are affected, in part, by tracheostomy tube size, the size of the patient\u2019s trachea, and volume of air in the cuff. As a result, these variables have the potential to impact swallowing biomechanics in many ways not limited to the pressures generated during the swallow. Hence, these independent variables are key to understanding the impact of tracheostomy modifications in general but more particularly in conditions where cuff volumes are altered. Of the four studies investigating cuff volume alterations [41, 44, 46, 48], only two studies reported on tracheostomy tube diameter [44, 48]. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain the degree to which other variants or independent variables impact swallowing outcomes. Together, this supports the use of more objective approaches to measuring swallowing in future studies, whether through psychometrically validated impairment scales or quantitative measurements along with the inclusion of relevant tracheostomy tube data.",

The majority of the studies that we identified have poor study quality and high bias risk. Given the multifactorial nature of dysphagia following tracheostomy, it is important to espouse a study design that facilitates objective comparisons while controlling for confounds. We recommend homogeneity across both patient diagnoses and airway variables or alternatively, large enough samples to support the inherent heterogeneity while providing generalizability and the opportunity for statistical testing. Primary studies should also report on the pulmonary and tracheostomy data with greater detail. This would include, but not be limited to: pulmonary performance, ventilator parameters, cuff volume measurement, tracheostomy tube size, and tracheostomy tube type. Furthermore, utilizing instrumental swallowing assessments to capture the swallow following tracheostomy modifications is prudent given the complexity of this patient population and their high rates of aspiration and silent aspiration [39, 43, 44, 46]. Following assessment completion, it is crucial to interpret these assessments ideally through psychometrically validated tools or quantitative measurements in order to maintain objectivity and facilitate within and between study comparisons. Moving forward, these steps will facilitate our understanding of the impact of tracheostomy modification on swallowing physiology thereby informing how best to remediate dysphagia following tracheostomy placement.",
