This has raised a public alert toward the potential occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic caused by a novel human virus strain originating from the avian H5N1 influenza virus, through adaptive mutations or recombinations with human influenza viruses. In this eventuality, the timescale necessary for the worldwide production and deployment of adequate vaccine supplies could exceed six to eight months [2] . In addition, in the case of diseases in which the infected individuals are infectious before the appearance of the first clinical signs [3] , nonmedical interventions such as travel-related measures might not be as efficient [4] as they proved to be during the spread of SARS [5] . In this context, antiviral (AV) drugs represent one of the crucial resources to reduce morbidity and mortality of a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine [6] [7] [8] [9] . For this reason, several recent studies provided evidence that the use of AV drugs is an effective strategy for the local containment of the emerging pandemic strain at the source [7, 10] .",

            "text": "The real issue in assessing the impact of a pandemic is, however, in its global character, and in the effects resulting from the complex interplay of epidemic spread occurring in different countries. The study of the global scale of a pandemic must examine three major factors in modeling studies: (i) In learning from the lessons of the 1918 pandemic and the ongoing debate on its origins, scenario evaluations must investigate the possibility of a pandemic starting anywhere in the world and not only in underdeveloped countries. (ii) Determining the likelihood of the global spread of a pandemic must include consideration of the effects of human travel. Even if local intervention were to mitigate and eradicate an epidemic locally, it is possible that during the course of containment, which generally lasts for weeks, air traffic might trigger a global event affecting multiple countries. The air traffic would also alter the evolution of the local epidemics with the entry of new, infectious individuals from elsewhere, a nonlocal effect not specifically considered in previous studies [7, 10] , or implemented as assumed boundary conditions [11, 12] . (iii) AV stockpiling is mainly a function of a country's wealth and level of preparedness to deal with a future pandemic; consequently, stockpiles are very low or absent in a majority of countries. It is, therefore, relevant to study effective strategies that optimize the use of the available supplies of AV drugs in the case of a worldwide spread.",

The epidemic model includes census data for all 3,100 urban areas studied and airline traffic flow between those regions, all of which accounts for 99% of airline traffic worldwide. Such detailed information allows for the study of a pandemic originating anywhere in the world. We first investigate the pandemic evolution on a global scale in the absence of containment strategies, studying the effect of different initial conditions and virus infectiousness, quantified by the basic reproductive number R 0 . This preliminary analysis allows us to outline a set of baseline cases to contrast with different intervention scenarios. We first analyse the effect of travel restrictions on the overall evolution of the pandemic, and then consider the best-case scenario in which each hit country can rely on massive AV stockpiles. We also investigate the effect of traveling patterns on the occurrence of a global outbreak affecting a large number of countries worldwide even if an effective mitigation of the epidemic is achieved in the hit populations. Finally, with the aim of designing realistic scenarios concerning AV stockpiles, we take into consideration that the amount of available supplies is finite and concentrated in a limited number of countries. We therefore contrast uncooperative intervention strategies, in which prepared countries use their stockpiles only within their own borders, against increasingly cooperative strategies in which progressively larger fractions of the stockpiles of prepared countries are shared with unprepared countries worldwide.",

Specifically, two studies [19, 22] address the computational analysis of influenza pandemics. These approaches were limited, however, by a small dataset of 50 cities available at that time and a simplified compartmental model. Moreover, the methods [19, 22] do not take into account stochastic effects and AV distribution, or other containment measures. In this study, we are in a position to take advantage of the recent increase in computer power and scale up the modeling approach to utilize the IATA dataset to its fullest extent, as well as taking the stochastic nature of the dynamics into account. We used the standard compartmentalization in which individuals can exist only in one of the discrete states such as susceptible (S), latent (L), infected (I), permanently recovered (R), etc. In the case of AV administration we used up to seven different compartments (see below). In each city j the population is N j , and X \u00bdm j \u00f0t\u00de is the number of individuals in the state (m) at time t. By definition it follows that N j \u00bc P m X \u00bdm j \u00f0t\u00de. The dynamics of individuals based on travels between cities is described by the stochastic transport operator X j (fX [m] g) representing the net balance of individuals in a given state X [m] that entered and left each city j. This operator is a function of the traffic flows with the neighboring cities w jl per unit time and of the city population N j . In particular, the number of passengers in each category traveling from a city j to a city l is an integer random variable, in that each of the potential travelers has a probability p jl \u00bc w jl Dt/N j to go from j to l in the time interval Dt. In each city j the numbers of passengers traveling on each connection j ! l at time t define a set of stochastic variables that follow a multinomial distribution [13, 14] . The calculation can be extended to include transit traffic (e.g., up to one connection flight).",

We used the two compartmental schemes reported in Figure 2 . In the baseline scenario with no intervention, a susceptible individual (S) in contact with a symptomatic (I t , I nt ) or asymptomatic (I a ) infectious individual becomes infected with rate b or r b b, respectively, and enters the latent class (L). When the latency period ends, the individual becomes infectious, i.e. able to transmit the infection, developing symptoms (I t , I nt ) with probability 1 \u00c0 p a , while becoming asymptomatic (I a ) with probability p a . Among the symptomatic individuals, we distinguished between those who are allowed to travel (I t )-with probability p t -and those who are not allowed (I nt )-with probability 1 \u00c0 p t -depending on the severity of the disease. After the infectious period, all infectious individuals enter the recovered class (R). e \u00c01 and l \u00c01 represent the mean latency period and the average duration of infection, respectively. We assumed that the latency period coincides with the incubation period with mean length of e \u00c01 \u00bc 1.9 d, followed by the infectious phase of average duration l \u00c01 \u00bc 3 d [6] [7] [8] . Both the incubation and infectious periods are distributed exponentially around these averages. We assumed the probability of being asymptomatic given that infection has occurred to be p a \u00bc 33% [6, 7] . The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is r b \u00bc 50%. If the individual develops symptoms during the infectious period, he/she is then restricted from traveling (I nt ) with probability 1 \u00c0 p t \u00bc 50% [6, 7] .",

Moreover, individuals under AV treatment are not allowed to travel. Note that asymptomatic individuals do not look for health-care assistance and therefore cannot receive any treatment. The rate p AV takes into account the probability per unit time of detecting a symptomatic infected individual and the efficiency of AV distribution in the infected area. We assumed that ill individuals under treatment might naturally recover, thus modeling a possible excessive use of AV courses. The infectiousness of an ill individual under treatment is reduced by a factor AVE I \u00bc 0.62 which represents the efficacy of the AV drugs [7] ; in this case the transmission parameter is thus given by b(1 \u00c0 AVE I ). Moreover, the average infectious period for a treated ill individual is reduced by one day. The combination of p AV , AVE I , and the reduction of the average infectious period corresponds to a reduction of the overall infectiousness of treated individuals ranging from 50% to 30%. In the Text S1 we report the sensitivity analysis for different overall reductions by changing the reduction of the infectious period.

We considered four scenarios for the basic reproduction rate of the pandemic, namely R 0 \u00bc 1.1, R 0 \u00bc 1.5, R 0 \u00bc 1.9, and R 0 \u00bc 2.3. These values account for a broad spectrum of infectiveness of the virus ranging from a very mild situation (due to a potential loss of transmissibility with respect to the avian influenza virus [4] ) to values comparable to the 1918 pandemic [27] . While estimates of the reproductive rate for pandemic influenza vary considerably in the literature [3, 8, 19, 28, 29] , recent studies tend to revise downward large values of R 0 previously estimated [10, 27, 30] . For this reason, we focused on the R 0 range mentioned above, not considering higher values, which would lead to a trivially unstoppable pandemic and thus provide limited information in the analysis of containment scenarios. We considered two dates for the pandemic start that correspond to different seasons in the different hemispheres: beginning of October and beginning of April. Because of the widespread outbreaks among poultry and the number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza in Southeast Asia [1] , we considered as potential starting locations both Vietnam and Thailand. We also analyzed scenarios in which the outbreak source is in Europe or in the United States, since pandemics have historically also emerged in these areas [31] . In the Text S1 we report the corresponding results for all the different starting conditions that we considered, including small cities in rural areas where the close proximity between humans and animals might favor the emergence of a novel virus (Text S1). We provide video files representing the geographical spread starting from selected locations (Videos S1-S4).",

Two different dates for the start of the pandemic are shown: October (left) and April (right). The average attack rates in the case that a global outbreak occurs are also reported, by showing the average number of cases per 1,000 at the end of the first year. Results are obtained from n \u00bc 500 different realizations of the noise. (B) Timing of the influenza pandemic in the six regions under study, for R 0 \u00bc 1.5 and R 0 \u00bc 1.9, for two different initial dates: October (left column) and April (right column). Sporadic activity occurs when the average prevalence reports (10 \u00c02 \u00c0 1) cases per 1,000, while epidemic activity is defined by more than one case per 1,000. The average profile is obtained by considering all runs for each region that experienced an outbreak in the region itself during the time window investigated. The thick vertical line corresponds to one year after the start of the pandemic. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040013.g003 of the pandemics. While we report detailed figures for six main geographical areas as defined in the Text S1 (North America, Western Europe, Central America, Southeast Asia, Lower South America, and Oceania), the simulations provided a detailed analysis at the level of a single country and/or urban area, as reported in the Text S1. The stochastic nature of the model enabled us to measure the probability that an outbreak will evolve to global proportions, thus affecting more than one country, and the corresponding average number of cases that it will generate overall and in each urban area. In Figure 3A we consider a pandemic starting in Hanoi, in the tropical climate zone, and we report for the different reproductive rates the obtained probability that an outbreak will reach a number of countries in the ranges 2-10, 11-50, 51-100, and higher than 100. In the case of a low reproductive rate (R 0 \u00bc 1.1), approximately 80%-90% of the epidemics starting with a single infectious individual undergo a stochastic extinction due to the low reproductive rate. Moreover, even if the virus spreads outside the initially infected country, the average number of cases is very low (not more than ten per 100,000), so pandemics with reproductive rates close to R 0 \u00bc 1.1 represent a very mild threat at the global level.",

In Figure  4 we report outbreak data ( Figure 4A ) and the timeline ( Figure 4B ) for a pandemic starting in Bucharest. We modeled a pandemic originating in Romania, because this was one of the European countries with confirmed presence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in domestic birds by the beginning of the year 2006 [1] . In this case the starting seed is in the Northern hemisphere, and results show important differences with the case depicted in Figure 3 , regarding both the global impact over one year and the timeline. In particular, the role of seasonality is clear under these conditions. For a starting date in October (i.e., fall in the Northern hemisphere), the probability of global outbreak is very similar to that observed in Figure 3 . A difference is found in the occurrence of the epidemic peak in Western Europe within the first year for R 0 \u00bc 1.5, due to the high traffic connections of this region with Romania. In contrast, if the starting date corresponds to April (i.e., spring in Bucharest), the likelihood of a global outbreak is dramatically reduced, and the corresponding global attack rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower with respect to the scenario in which Hanoi is the initially infected city. The strong decrease in the probability of worldwide outbreaks and in the number of observed cases is due to the fact that the starting conditions-both temporal and geographical-are not in favor of a fast and global spread of the disease, since it originates in the Northern hemisphere during the noninfluenza season, thus being characterized by a lower transmission parameter. At intermediate reproductive rates different geographical regions belonging to the same hemisphere may experience a first pandemic wave several months apart, as shown in Figures  3 and 4 . This is an effect due to the airline transportation network, which connects different global regions with highly heterogeneous fluxes. At higher reproductive rates, this effect is diminished due to the level of infectiousness of the pandemic, in which seasonal effects and differences in the timescales induced by transportation fluxes are irrelevant.",

Additional strategies consider nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, early isolation of infectious individuals, school and workplace closures [7, 10, 11, 32, 33] . In an emerging pandemic, however, the production and deployment of adequate vaccine supplies would require a time period on the order of six to eight months [2] . Global travel limitations, considered a nonmedical intervention aimed at containing the virus propagation, would be unfeasible since they are so economically disruptive [4, 34] . In the Text S1 we show that even drastic travel limitations delay the pandemic evolution by only a few weeks as compared to the baseline case, with almost no impact on the morbidity, as shown elsewhere [32, 34] (but see also the controversial aspects discussed in [35] [36] [37] ). The international community would therefore have to rely initially on AV drugs, which represent a viable response measure to a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine and of other feasible interventions [4, 6, 8, 9, 11] . In this context, several recent studies considered the use of AV drugs as an effective strategy for the local containment of the emerging strain at the source [7, 10] .",

We thus expanded the compartmental model used for the baseline case, as reported in Figure 2 . In particular we considered the application of different AV therapeutic protocols as measured by the rate of treatment p AV per symptomatic cases per unit time [6] [7] [8] . This parameter models the efficiency and rapidity of case detection and treatment delivery. Finally, we also considered that AV treatment interventions are set up with a characteristic delay [7] . We consider that large-scale AV treatments start after the detection of a cluster of 20 infectious individuals in the country where the epidemic starts and three days after the detection of the first infected case in all countries afterward (a sensitivity analysis to the two different time delays is shown in the Text S1).",

In Table  2 , we report the necessary stockpiles (courses per 1,000 people) for each geographical region according to the three AV therapeutic protocols studied (i.e., p AV \u00bc 0.7/d, 0.5/d, and 0.3/d, corresponding to a probability of 70%, 50%, and 30% per day to have symptomatic cases entering an AV treatment, respectively). We focused on the threatening cases of R 0 . 1.5, for a pandemic seeded in Hanoi in October. For R 0 \u00bc 1.9, AV therapeutic protocols that focus on a timely treatment of For R 0 \u00bc 1.9, 2.3, and for different values of the AV distribution rates (p AV \u00bc 0.7/day, 0.5/day, and 0.3/day) we report for each region: (i) the average number of cases per 1,000 after the first year; (ii) the average arrival time (i.e., first case detected in the region); (iii) the average peak time; and (iv) the average number of AV doses per 1,000 needed after 8 and 12 mo from the start of the pandemic to fully implement the relative treatment program (determined by the rate of treated cases p AV ). The initial condition is given by a single symptomatic infected individual in Hanoi at the beginning of October. AV treatments start after 20 cases have been identified in at least one country and then with a delay of three days after the identification of the first case in all secondary outbreaks. CI, confidence interval. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040013.t002 symptomatic cases (p AV ; 0.7/d) appear to be very effective in mitigating the pandemics. These protocols limit the global attack rate to a few cases per 1,000 with the use of AV stockpiles that do not exceed 2%-3% of the world population during the first year, reaching peaks of 4%-6% in certain regions. Moreover, the epidemic peak is almost never observed within the first 12 months. We do not report data for time windows larger than one year, since at that point vaccination intervention should be considered. The possibility of mitigating and delaying a pandemic peak for about one year is strongly supportive of the effectiveness of AV drug use as the first form of intervention. Figure 5 displays the probability of having a global outbreak for different values of R 0 for the various therapeutic protocols studied. Its comparison with Figure 3A shows that the application of AV interventions throughout the world strongly affects the probability that the virus will propagate out of the initially infected country. For R 0 \u00bc 1.1, the probability of containing the outbreak at the source is increased up to 97%-98% in the case of maximal coverage. The probability distribution of the number of countries infected changes dramatically also for R 0 \u00bc 1.5. The occurrence of a global outbreak may be eliminated because the AV use reduces R 0 to close to one in the initially hit countries bursting the probability of random extinction. This is consistent with the results of other studies [7, 10] stating that AV interventions are more likely to contain the pandemic at the source. However, as soon as R 0 increases, there is a large probability that while the pandemic is mitigated and may appear under control locally, just a few traveling individuals may introduce epidemic seeds in other countries and trigger the global spread of the pandemic (see Figure 6A and 6B referring to two different values of the attack rate at the source). In this context, models that do not consider international travel [33] are missing an important variable and cannot provide a full picture of the occurrence of global pandemics.",

The recommendation by the World Health Organization is to stockpile drugs in advance, but with the actual rate of production it is reasonable to expect that AV drugs will be neither available in adequate quantities nor distributed homogeneously among countries during the initial stage of the pandemic [11] .

We examine increasingly cooperative strategies in which all prepared countries give up one-tenth (cooperative strategy I) and one-fifth (cooperative strategy II) of their stockpiles for international use. The level of AV coverage in prepared countries thus is lowered to 9% and 8% in cooperative strategies I and II, respectively. The number of courses provided by the prepared countries is assumed to be collected in a global stockpile to be redistributed worldwide to the countries that experience an outbreak. In the Text S1 we also report simulation results in which the donated courses are instead preemptively deployed in each country proportionally to the population size. The first method is most effective in that it allows the flexible deployment of AV drugs where there is an actual need. Symptomatic cases receive the treatment with rate p AV as long as AV drugs are still available, either from the global stockpile or from the country stockpile. The difference between Figure 6 . Importance of Air Travel in the Worldwide Spread of Pandemic Influenza The two snapshots show the countries in orange that have a nonnull probability of being infected by the time Vietnam (seeded country) experiences an attack rate of 10 \u00c06 (A) and 10 \u00c05 (B) cases. Results refer to a pandemic originated in Hanoi in October with R 0 \u00bc 1.9, with the assumption of unlimited AV supplies available. A country is defined as infected (experiencing an outbreak) if at least one generation of secondary cases occurs. Although the number of cases inside Vietnam is very low, the virus has already propagated out of the initial borders to other countries, thus providing several different seeds for the worldwide spread of the disease.

After exhaustion of the global stockpiles, ill individuals in the unprepared countries are no longer treated. Both strategies, however, assume an extensive deployment of AV treatment in unprepared countries from the World Health Organization international stockpile [40] and/or from contributions of other countries, emphasizing the importance of a timely and coordinated response to a pandemic emergency.

The cooperative strategies give rise to one to three orders of magnitude fewer symptomatic cases. In Figure 9B we report the prevalence profile in some countries chosen as illustrative examples, among the six regions considered. Surprisingly, we find that the global coverage intervention is also beneficial in the prepared countries, which benefit from massive stockpiles under any circumstance: the attack rate after the first year is always lower when cooperative strategies are used. This is due to the fact that resources accumulated only in a few countries would not prevent an outbreak explosion in the other regions of the world that are not provided with AV supplies. The inability of mitigating the disease impact on a global level would affect in turn the prepared countries. In addition, global AV interventions give rise to pandemic peaks delayed by more than one year in all world regions. This is extremely important since it indicates that AV treatments distributed on a global scale, even if unevenly, would enable the international community to gain enough time to develop and deploy the appropriate vaccine. Analogous results are obtained also for different initial conditions (see the Text S1).",

An initial stockpile able to cover 10% of the population of prepared countries is assumed. In the uncooperative strategy (left), the totality of these resources is used exclusively for national purposes. The cooperative strategy I (center) is based on the global redistribution of one-tenth of the resources stockpiled by prepared countries, which will thus be able to count on supplies covering 9% of their own population. In the cooperative strategy II (right) the amount provided for global sharing is increased to one-fifth, with a corresponding decrease of the supplies from 10% to 8% in the prepared countries stockpiles.

The probability of a global outbreak occurring is subdivided into four bins, according to the number of infected countries (see Figure 3A ). doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040013.g007 For the sake of simplicity, only one cooperative strategy is shown, namely cooperative strategy II.

While mitigation of the pandemic might be achieved by following the previous criteria, the containment of the pandemic is unlikely for R 0 . 1.5. Indeed, above those values of the reproductive rate, even if the attack rate is extremely small, infected individuals are traveling with appreciable probability, and pandemics affecting hundred of countries are likely, despite the effective reduction of R 0 . Finally, for large R 0 (indicatively . 1.9), interventions based solely on AV therapeutic use are sufficient to neither contain nor mitigate the pandemic, which even in the case of massive AV supplies (approximately 20% of the population) reaches clinical attack rates up to 30%-50% of the population in the most affected regions.",

The reproductive rate up to which the cooperative strategy is effective depends on the effectiveness of AV drug distribution (i.e., the rate at which symptomatic individuals are detected and AV courses administered). It is noteworthy that the cooperative strategies are also beneficial for the prepared countries that share a part of their own resources for global distribution. The success of cooperative strategies, however, implies the adoption of a ''global'' perspective in planning pandemic containment, one calling for a coordinated effort among the international community and the World Health Organization, as opposed to a unilateral strategy in which individual countries rely on their own stockpiles.",

We do not have levels of variations in the virus transmissibility among infected individuals within each compartment [41] . Population heterogeneity, in terms of traveling frequency, is another feature that is neglected. Travel frequency is related to financial and economic status and should be implemented by considering specific compart-ments. Finally, we are mainly concerned with urban areas surrounding airports. This implies neglecting rural areas that might be relevant in less developed countries. While we collected part of the data concerning the previously mentioned socioeconomic features (for instance, wealth distribution), we avoided uncontrolled guesses and preferred not to overload the model with parameters that are not yet data driven. With regard to the etiology of the disease, we considered a given set of parameters for the incubation period, the infectious period, and the asymptomatic proportion. While these parameters find different estimates in the literature, it is possible to study their effect by sensitivity analysis, and in many cases their variation can be absorbed in the change of R 0 .",

Seasonal outbreaks (epidemics) of influenza-a viral infection of the nose, throat, and airways-affect millions of people and kill about 500,000 individuals every year. Regular epidemics occur because flu viruses frequently make small changes in the viral proteins (antigens) recognized by the human immune system. Consequently, a person's immune-system response that combats influenza one year provides incomplete protection the next year. Occasionally, a human influenza virus appears that contains large antigenic changes. People have little immunity to such viruses (which often originate in birds or animals), so they can start a global epidemic (pandemic) that kills millions of people. Experts fear that a human influenza pandemic could be triggered by the avian H5N1 influenza virus, which is present in bird flocks around the world. So far, fewer than 300 people have caught this virus but more than 150 people have died.",

If it does acquire this ability, it would take 6-8 months to develop a vaccine to provide protection against this new, potentially pandemic virus. Public health officials therefore need other strategies to protect people during the first few months of a pandemic. These could include international travel restrictions and the use of antiviral drugs. However, to get the most benefit from these interventions, public-health officials need to understand how influenza pandemics spread, both over time and geographically. In this study, the researchers have used detailed information on air travel to model the global spread of an emerging influenza pandemic and its containment.",

The researchers incorporated data on worldwide air travel and census data from urban centers near airports into a mathematical model of the spread of an influenza pandemic. They then used this model to investigate how the spread and health effects of a pandemic flu virus depend on the season in which it emerges (influenza virus thrives best in winter), where it emerges, and how infectious it is. Their model predicts, for example, that a flu virus originating in Hanoi, Vietnam, with a reproductive number (R 0 ) of 1.1 (a measure of how many people an infectious individual infects on average) poses a very mild global threat. However, epidemics initiated by a virus with an R 0 of more than 1.5 would often infect half the population in more than 100 countries. Next, the researchers used their model to show that strict travel restrictions would have little effect on pandemic evolution. More encouragingly, their model predicts that antiviral drugs would mitigate pandemics of a virus with an R 0 up to 1.9 if every country had an antiviral drug stockpile sufficient to treat 5% of its population; if the R 0 was 2.3 or higher, the pandemic would not be contained even if 20% of the population could be treated. Finally, the researchers considered a realistic scenario in which only a few countries possess antiviral stockpiles. In these circumstances, compared with a ''selfish'' strategy in which countries only use their antiviral drugs within their borders, limited worldwide sharing of antiviral drugs would slow down the spread of a flu virus with an R 0 of 1.9 by more than a year and would benefit both drug donors and recipients.",

Like all mathematical models, this model for the global spread of an emerging pandemic influenza virus contains many assumptions (for example, about viral behavior) that might affect the accuracy of its predictions. The model also does not consider variations in travel frequency between individuals or viral spread in rural areas. Nevertheless, the model provides the most extensive global simulation of pandemic influenza spread to date. Reassuringly, it suggests that an emerging virus with a low R 0 would not pose a major public-health threat, since its attack rate would be limited and would not peak for more than a year, by which time a vaccine could be developed. Most importantly, the model suggests that cooperative sharing of antiviral drugs, which could be organized by the World Health Organization, might be the best way to deal with an emerging influenza pandemic.",

The map portrays the locations of urban airports worldwide; geographical data are obtained from open sources on the Internet and mapped with ArcGIS software (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis). A schematic illustration represents the patch or metapopulation model adopted, in which the total population is divided into subpopulations each corresponding to the urban area surrounding each airport. Filled circles inside each subpopulation represent individuals, and the colors correspond to a specific stage of the disease. Homogeneous mixing for the infection dynamics is assumed inside each urban area, and different urban areas; subpopulations are coupled by means of air travel, according to the International Air Transport Association traffic fluxes. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040013.g001",
