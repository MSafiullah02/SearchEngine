Table I shows common direct and indirect causes of ALI/ARDS. Whether this \u2018first hit\u2019 to the lung is direct or indirect, a pulmonary inflammatory response may occur, which often is adaptive and self-limited. However, when coupled with repeated \u2018hits\u2019 to the lung from insults such as injurious mechanical ventilation or other secondary processes such as hypotension, a cycle of intense inflammation and worsening pulmonary injury ensues. The \u2018multiple hit\u2019 theory of ARDS progression also provides a framework for studying the disease process (figure 1).\n\n\n",

The aforementioned criteria but with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200 is classified as ARDS.[8] Although differentiated by the AECC definition, ALI and ARDS are often grouped together for the purpose of clinical trial enrolment and are treated as a single entity throughout this review.",

Mechanical ventilation itself may cause secondary insult to the already inflamed oedematous alveoli. During each tidal breath induced by mechanical ventilation, unstable alveoli undergo cyclical collapse and shearing open, termed \u2018atelectrauma\u2019. Furthermore, the non-collapsed alveolar units may receive a greater proportion of the delivered tidal volume, leading to damage due to overdistention or \u2018volutrauma\u2019. Further breakdown of the endothelial-epithelial barrier may occur with atelectrauma and volutrauma, along with the release of local proinflammatory mediators which further propagate this cycle of ventilator-exacerbated lung injury.[7]",

Activated neutrophils release proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and neutrophil elastase (NE), which further damage the alveolar-capillary membrane.[9] Activated neutrophils also contain high levels of arachidonic acid,[10] which is metabolized into leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Leukotrienes attract more neutrophils, prostaglandins are proinflammatory mediators, and thromboxanes play a role in vasoconstriction and platelet and leukocyte aggregation. Neutrophil recruitment and activation may be an adaptive physiological response to injury, or may incite a vicious cycle of inflammation and further damage.[9]",

The inflammatory milieu within the alveoli, coupled with the cyclical opening, stretching and collapsing of alveoli via mechanical ventilation, initiates a number of pathogenic pathways in concert or in series. These include disruption of surfactant function and metabolism, ongoing neutrophil recruitment and activation, along with increased expression and release of inflammatory mediators, imbalance of oxidant and antioxidant activity, and activation of complement and coagulation cascades. Each of these pathways is further discussed to provide context for the drugs or therapies aimed at ameliorating these various mechanisms (see section 3).",

In this setting, the injured lung may represent a rich source of inflammatory mediators that could contribute to the development of multi-organ failure. For example, stress failure and necrosis of the endothelial-epithelial barrier may allow various inflammatory mediators, bacteria and endotoxins to quickly spread from the lungs into the systemic circulation. Indeed, it is this de-compartmentalization of inflammatory mediators from the lungs into the circulation that is felt to lead to cell apoptosis in distal organs,[14] and ultimately multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [figure 2].[15] Once MODS develops, disease is often irreversible and mortality may increase significantly to 60\u201398%, the latter occurring when three or more organs are involved for a period of more than 7 days.[15\u201317] Thus, a key to developing novel therapies that will reduce mortality in ARDS will be identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ARDS leads to MODS.\n\n",

During days 8\u201328, the exudates and hyaline membranes become organized, and fibrosis may become apparent. Type II alveolar cells proliferate and line the alveolar walls, fibroblasts migrate and differentiate into myofibroblasts in the interstitial and alveolar spaces, and a collagen-rich extracellular matrix is laid down in the interstitium.[13] Alveoli may be destroyed, pulmonary vascular area may be reduced and chronic inflammation is generally present. Patients in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS may slowly recover, or may fail to wean from mechanical ventilation and succumb to complications of a lengthy critical illness or pre-existing co-morbid illnesses. Pharmaceutical interventions for late ARDS must interrupt the fibrosing alveolitis and aid in resolution, remodelling and repair of injured lungs.[13] Often, therapies that might be beneficial during the early phase of lung injury are started too late in the course of the disease, when fibrosis is already established, muting their potential efficacy. When tested specifically for the late fibroproliferative phase of ARDS, anti-inflammatory therapies have yielded disappointing results. Basic science research examining mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may illuminate therapeutic pathways for fibroproliferative ARDS, but further work is required in this area.",

This trial compared a traditional tidal volume of 12 mL/kg with a lower tidal volume of 6 mL/kg in 861 patients and reported a mortality reduction from 40% in the control arm to 31% in the treatment arm.[5] These results definitively ended the debate fuelled by three previous inconclusive smaller trials regarding lower versus conventional tidal volumes. In terms of furthering ALI/ARDS research, several lessons have been learned from this landmark study. First, ARDSnet was set up to conduct well designed, large, phase III studies with a concerted effort to optimize patient enrolment through involvement of many centres in an organized and cohesive group.[22] This enabled a study sufficiently powered to realize a mortality difference to be conducted within a reasonable timeframe, and pointed the way for other similarly structured ARDS research networks to become established. Second, the treatment arm was associated with lower oxygenation values than the conventional arm, highlighting the potential danger of relying on oxygenation or other physiological parameters as surrogates for mortality. Third, this study demonstrated that a non-pharmacological intervention could alter mortality, indicating that future RCTs need to be carefully standardized in all aspects of supportive care in both treatment and control arms.",

This approach may be misguided, as subsequent studies have demonstrated differences between patients with direct and indirect causes of ALI/ARDS in responsiveness to specific therapies.[23,24] Research is ongoing to determine whether newer modes of mechanical ventilation, such as high-frequency oscillation (HFO), can further improve outcomes in ARDS relative to the ARDSnet low tidal volume strategy.[25] In addition, other aspects of supportive care have been evaluated in large clinical trials, some conducted by ARDSnet, and have proven effective in reducing morbidity associated with critical illness. These include cautious fluid management,[26,27] adequate nutrition,[28] prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia,[29\u201332] prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis[33] and gastric ulcers,[34] weaning of sedation and mechanical ventilation as early as possible,[35] and physiotherapy and rehabilitation.[36] A recent review of all patients enrolled in ARDSnet studies between 1996 and 2005 showed that these advancements in critical care (aside from lower tidal volume ventilation) are likely responsible for the improved survival in ALI/ARDS patients in clinical trials noted over the last decade.[37]",

Nitric oxide[38] and prone positioning[39,40] have not been shown to reduce mortality or duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with ALI/ARDS, and are therefore not recommended for routine use. However, combined together, these therapies may provide a sustained improvement in oxygenation for patients with severe hypoxaemia and a mortality benefit for patients who are failing conventional mechanical ventilation strategies.[39\u201341] A clinical trial of HFO for routine care of patients with ARDS is currently underway, but existing evidence supports its use as salvage therapy if instituted early for patients failing conventional ventilation,[42] and may have additive benefits when combined with nitric oxide and prone positioning.[43] Finally, ECMO has recently been studied in the CESAR trial (see table III for a list of trial acronyms).[44] This study showed that transferring adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure, whose Murray score exceeds 3.0 or who have a pH of <7.20 on optimum conventional management, to a centre with an ECMO-based management protocol, significantly improved survival without severe disability. Recent evidence suggests ECMO is also useful for rescue therapy for adults with severe ARDS due to H1N1-influenza A virus infection.[45]\n\n",

As mentioned in section 1, patients with ARDS have increased levels of arachidonic acid metabolites in their bronchoalveolar fluid.[10,87] Metabolism of arachidonic acid leads to the production of leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor, and is involved with platelet and leukocyte aggregation, while leukotrienes act as powerful chemokines to attract neutrophils. Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent of the imidazole class which selectively blocks thromboxane synthetase. Ketoconazole also inhibits 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme necessary to generate leukotrienes, and inhibits procoagulant activity.[55] In addition to showing promise in preclinical animal studies, when given prophylactically to patients at risk of developing ARDS, ketoconazole has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe ARDS in three small trials.",

Building on the results of these two studies, Sinuff and colleagues[48] developed practice guidelines for prophylactic ketoconazole use, and tested the implementation and efficacy of these guidelines in two ICUs (one control and one active comparator). They reported a significantly decreased incidence of ARDS in the ICU population receiving ketoconazole prophylaxis, although mortality was equivalent within the two units.[48]",

Of note, this study was designed to look at early treatment of ALI/ARDS rather than prevention of ARDS in patients at risk, and therefore did not necessarily negate the findings of the three previous smaller studies. Furthermore, a problem identified in the KARMA study was that even though blood ketoconazole concentrations were adequate, urinary metabolites of thromboxane were not affected, raising the possibility that the proper dose to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect was not given. However, since the KARMA study showed no difference in mortality, widely considered the most important endpoint to achieve, further research on ketoconazole for ALI/ARDS ceased.[55] Additionally, ketoconazole has numerous drug interactions and requires an acidic milieu to be absorbed via the enteral route, making routine use in the ICU complicated.",

In this model, captopril reduced expression of ICAM-1 in lung tissue, indicating a protective effect on endothelial cells, diminished activity of tissue plasminogen activator, involved in coagulation, and blocked NF-\u03baB, the major signal transduction pathway that regulates the expression of multiple early-response genes related to inflammation.[49] In humans, two small cohort studies have demonstrated that polymorphism of the ACE gene increases susceptibility to the development of ARDS and its outcome.[89,90] Two additional studies, published only in abstract form to date, have examined the association between ACE inhibitor use and ARDS. A retrospective cohort study of 1423 adult critically ill patients found that 5.5% of patients developed ARDS after hospital admission, and that pre-existing, long-term use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB was associated with decreased risk of ARDS development, after adjusting for predisposing conditions (odds ratio [OR] 0.49; 95% CI 0.25, 0.94; p = 0.03).[91] The second abstract, a case-control study nested within a prospective cohort of 1553 critically ill patients at risk for ARDS, reported that patients on ACE inhibitors had a lower prevalence of respiratory failure on admission to ICU, but not lower incidence of ARDS after adjusting for confounders on multivariate analysis. However, among patients who developed ARDS, ACE inhibitor use was associated with lower mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.45, 0.99).[92] The associations observed in these clinical studies is consistent with preclinical animal data, but requires further research prior to being applicable clinically.[90]",

PPAR-\u03b3 plays a central role in glucose homeostasis. Thiazolidinediones, a class of oral antidiabetic drugs, are synthetic ligands for PPAR-\u03b3. Synthetic PPAR-\u03b3 agonists also have anti-inflammatory properties, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage activation in vitro.[93,94] This action is mediated in part by antagonizing the activity of transcription factor NF-\u03baB. When activated, NF-\u03baB induces overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, which in turn induces upregulation of ICAM-1 expression, as well as recruitment and activation of immune cells. ICAM-1, expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, mediates leukocyte adhesion and migration through endothelium into tissues. The anti-inflammatory properties of thiazolidinediones have been demonstrated in vivo in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease[95] and rheumatoid arthritis.[96] Rosiglitazone is the most potent selective PPAR-\u03b3 of the thiazolidinediones.",

A recent meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated that preventive corticosteroids may actually increase the risk of developing ARDS in critically ill adults.[53] Furthermore, the meta-analysis suggested a weakly increased risk of death associated with preventive corticosteroid therapy in those patients who ultimately developed ARDS. Thus, corticosteroid therapy is not recommended for preventing ARDS in those at risk.

Without optimal surfactant function, there is high surface tension at the alveolar surface in a non-uniform pattern within the lung leading to alveolar instability and collapse. The presence of bacteria within the airspace may also release and activate endotoxins, a process that is augmented in the presence of an abnormal surfactant system. Based on the functional importance of the endogenous surfactant system in the normal lung and, more importantly, the consequences of an altered surfactant system in ALI/ARDS, there is good rationale to consider exogenous surfactant administration as a therapeutic intervention in these patients.[109]",

A follow-up meta-analysis pooling results of five multicentre studies of rSP-C confirmed this finding: the subgroup of patients with severe ARDS due to pneumonia or aspiration had decreased mortality when treated with rSP-C (26.3% vs 39.3% in the usual care group; p = 0.018).[24] Subsequently, a prospective phase III RCT evaluating effect of Venticute\u00ae in 1200 patients with pneumonia or aspiration of gastric contents was conducted. The study was terminated at 800 patients due to futility. Neither these results nor the potential reasons for futility have been published to date.[60]",

Eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes, derived from omega-3 fatty acids are generally much less proinflammatory than those derived from omega-6 fatty acids. Since omega-6 fatty acids compete with omega-3 fatty acids for the same rate-limiting enzymes in the production of eicosanoids, diets with a high proportion of omega-6 fats are thought to be proinflammatory and prothrombotic. Examples of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids are \u03b1-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.[119]",

Subsequently, as a consequence of cell surface integrins and their ligands, neutrophils undergo adhesion with endothelial cells. Following adherence, neutrophils must pass through the endothelial monolayer, interstitial tissue and alveolar epithelium to reach the alveolar space. Passage of large numbers of activated neutrophils can cause epithelial damage, sloughing and increased permeability both due to mechanical force exerted by neutrophil pseudopodia as well as due to release of toxic substances such as proteinases (e.g. elastases, cationic peptides, defensins, oxidants and MMPs).[9] While there are conflicting reports on the effects of elastase on increased epithelial permeability, cationic peptides such as defensins can cause both epithelial and endothelial cell injury. Defensin levels have been found to be greatly elevated in patients with ARDS and their levels correlate with the severity of lung injury.[124] Neutralizing its effects could be important in the management of ARDS. Ongoing research is examining if defensins can be used to identify patients with ALI at an early stage.[125]",

For example, it has been shown that the induction of neutrophil apoptosis by the administration of dead Escherichia coli prior to reperfusion resulted in significant improvement in lung injury.[130] Induction of neutrophil apoptosis in the alveolar space has the potential for resolution of inflammation in ARDS, and can be carried out in a number of ways that could include multiple strategies such as ligation of Fas, activation of proapoptotic caspases and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases or transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB. Hastening neutrophil apoptosis in the alveolar space may also decrease the probability of secondary necrosis and further tissue damage in ARDS. It is intriguing that no significant differences were found between the expression of neutrophil apoptosis in patients at risk and those with established ARDS, nor did the extent of apoptotic inhibition correlate with overall outcome in ARDS.[131] Therefore, while it is well established that ARDS is associated with accumulation of large numbers of neutrophils in alveolar spaces, their contribution to the severity of ARDS in humans remains uncertain.",

Specific cytokines are observed in high amounts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ARDS, and are thought to play an important role in propagating lung injury. Unsaturated phosphatidic acid plays an important role in intracellular signalling leading to neutrophil accumulation within the lungs, as well as proinflammatory cytokine expression and cell membrane oxidation, all of which leads to lung tissue damage.[135] Lisofylline (Cell Therapeutics) is a cytokine inhibitor that impedes synthesis of phosphatidic acid-1\u03b1 and, therefore, was thought to hold potential for treatment of ARDS. However, ARDSnet stopped a phase II/III trial, the LARMA study, for futility after the first interim analysis failed to demonstrate any difference in 28-day mortality, ventilator-free days, organ failures or levels of circulating free fatty acids.[76] Interleukin (IL)-8 is another potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, observed in high levels in patients with early ARDS[136] and associated with increased mortality.[137] Anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody has been shown to reduce pulmonary oedema and neutrophil accumulation in animal models of ARDS[77,78] but has not yet been tested in humans. Finally, TNF\u03b1 has long been recognized as an important proinflammatory cytokine in ARDS, but more recent evidence suggests that it actually plays a dichotomous role in both contributing to permeability oedema but also increasing alveolar fluid clearance capacity. Monoclonal anti-TNF\u03b1 antibodies have been tested in patients with sepsis with disappointing results.[138] Given its dual role in alveolar oedema formation and resorbtion, a more sophisticated approach than simply blocking all TNF\u03b1 activity is likely to be required in ARDS.",

In 1987, Bernard et al.[80] published results of a study of 99 patients with ARDS randomized to high-dose pulse methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg every 6 hours for 24 hours) or placebo. There was no difference in 45-day mortality (60% vs 63%; p = nonsignificant) but the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting that the study may have been underpowered to detect a small difference in a population with heterogenous outcomes. In 2007, Meduri and colleagues[79] published their results of 91 patients with severe early ARDS (<72 hours) from five hospitals randomized to methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 28 days versus placebo. They found corticosteroids significantly reduced ICU mortality (21% vs 43%; p = 0.03), duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay.[79] Annane et al.[81] published a post hoc analysis of 177 ARDS patients enrolled in an RCT of low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock. Patients in the treatment group received hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours plus fludrocortisone 50 \u03bcg/day for 7 days. Although there was no mortality difference for ARDS patients overall, ARDS patients with relative adrenal insufficiency and septic shock had significantly reduced mortality when treated with low-dose hydrocortisone (53% vs 75% in the placebo group; p = 0.01).[81] The use of corticosteroids for acute exudative ARDS remains controversial, although the evidence is more definitive for corticosteroid treatment initiated late for fibroproliferative ARDS (see section 3.3.1). A study examining low doses of corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy for lung injury associated with H1N1 influenza virus (CORTIFLU) is planned.[139]",

However, there are several lessons to be learned from these RCTs. First, a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach has not worked for pharmacotherapy for ARDS. In this sense, the syndrome of ALI/ARDS may be likened to cancer. Cancer as a broad term signifies the uncontrolled replication of abnormal cells, but there are specific chemotherapeutic treatments for specific types of cancer, depending on its origin. Some treatments may be effective for more than one type of cancer, but not for other types, and the magnitude of the benefit might vary according to the type and stage of disease. Oncologists would not design a trial enrolling all patients with differing types of cancer and expect to find a single drug that shows a survival benefit. Yet, that is what has been attempted with several large ARDS trials. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct ARDS is likely to respond differently than indirect ARDS, and in fact within these broad categories, pathogenesis may differ. Therefore, different therapies may need to be developed for specific aetiologies such as sepsis-related ARDS, SIRS-related ARDS and various direct causes of ARDS.",

It means that the therapy is likely to not be appropriate for widespread application. However, just because a drug does not work for every ARDS patient does not necessarily mean it should not be used for anyone with ARDS. For example, there is no evidence for treating all patients with acute ARDS with corticosteroids, but there is evidence that treating ARDS patients with relative adrenal insufficiency and septic shock with low doses of hydrocortisone is likely to be beneficial. Similarly, nitric oxide should not routinely be applied to all patients with ALI/ARDS, but may be useful in refractory hypoxaemia, particularly in conjunction with other ventilation rescue strategies.",

I\u2019ve just found 10 000 ways that won\u2019t work\u201d. ARDS research should take us from bench to bedside and back to the bench again. Basic science can help us understand basic mechanisms of disease, discover why a therapy failed, then provide new ideas to apply to the clinical realm. RCTs are necessary to prove benefit and quantify risk prior to changing clinical practice. Since we are in urgent need of therapies to treat ALI/ARDS, it is necessary that RCTs continue to advance our clinical care. However, these RCTs need to be well founded in basic biology and physiology research, and focused on specific hypotheses regarding mechanisms of disease. Continuing to conduct large clinical trials on heterogeneous patients with ALI/ARDS from multiple aetiologies will not only prove ineffective but also add enormous cost to the healthcare system.",

The ongoing CARDS study will attempt to reproduce that finding in adults with direct causes of ARDS.[117] This trial is continuing enrolment after the first interim analysis, with a target completion date of March 2011.",

Initially, inflammatory damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier results in increased vascular permeability, leading to interstitial and alveolar oedema as proteinaceous fluid fills the alveolar space. There, the proteinaceous fluid interferes with the function and metabolism of the endogenous surfactant system. Coupled with this, neutrophils that infiltrate lungs are subsequently activated and represent an important source of inflammatory mediators and oxygen free radicals, inducing further epithelial and endothelial cell damage and an altered host immune response. Newly secreted mediators and/or spill-over of inflammatory mediators from the lung into the systemic circulation ultimately contribute to the development of MOF. Inflammatory mediators released from organs such as the liver, heart and kidney return to the lung via the systemic circulation and may contribute to further pulmonary inflammation. Thus, each new insult to the pulmonary system accelerates the acute lung injury cycle (reproduced from Bosma et al.[7] [2007], with permission).",
