            "text": "Improvements in neonatal intensive care have resulted in decreased mortality rates of preterm infants. The development of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), however, can result in long-term adverse outcomes. Several studies of preterm infants have demonstrated that abnormal levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) within the first few days post-delivery are associated with the development of IVH [1, 2]. We recently reported that preterm infants who developed an IVH had higher end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) levels in the delivery suite during resuscitation [3]. It has not, however, been determined whether abnormal EtCO2 levels during resuscitation of preterm infants translate into abnormal CO2 levels over the subsequent 72 h after birth, and hence, whether it is a prolonged rather than an early insult which results in the development of IVH. Our aim then was to study EtCO2 levels in the delivery suite during resuscitation of preterm infants and their relationship to the subsequent CO2 levels within the first 3 days after birth and the development of IVH.",

In term infants, undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were also associated with a greater degree of pCO2 variability [4]. Preterm and unstable infants are more susceptible to changes in cerebral blood flow and display pressure passivity [5]. Furthermore, fluctuations of pCO2 can adversely affect cerebral oxygenation and perfusion and the electrical activity of the brain [6]; such fluctuation is predictive of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [7]. We have demonstrated that not only high EtCO2 levels during resuscitation in the delivery suite were associated with IVH development but also inflations resulting in larger tidal volumes and lower EtCO2 levels [3]. Those findings were subsequently confirmed by Mian and colleagues who found that tidal volumes in excess of 6 ml/kg were associated with cerebral damage in the neonatal period [8]. A further aim, therefore, of this study then was to test the hypothesis that infants exposed to the largest fluctuations in EtCO2 levels during resuscitation in the delivery suite would be at greatest risk of developing an IVH.",

The strength of any relationships of EtCO2 values during resuscitation with CO2 levels during the first 3 days after birth were assessed by calculating Spearman correlation coefficients. The performance of factors identified as significantly related to IVH development from the regression analysis were assessed by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and estimation of the corresponding area under the curve (AUC).

In addition, we highlight that the delta EtCO2 level in the delivery suite had both a high sensitivity and specificity in predicting IVH development. Importantly, we have shown that abnormal EtCO2 levels during resuscitation did not necessarily translate into abnormal levels on the neonatal unit. Our findings, then suggest that it is early abnormal carbon dioxide levels in preterm infants that are important in IVH development. Previously, initial post-delivery levels of pCO2 were found to be significantly higher in infants with cerebral haemorrhage than those without, but by 8 h after birth, those differences were no longer significant [10], which are consistent with our findings of the significant association of abnormal CO2 levels in the delivery suite, but not the neonatal unit, with IVH development. Some studies have suggested that sicker infants undergo more blood gas analysis than more stable infants, hence, allowing detection of a greater degree of fluctuation in levels of carbon dioxide [2]. We continuously monitored EtCO2 during resuscitation in all infants included in our cohort, and therefore, the outcomes relating to fluctuation of carbon dioxide are not influenced by the infant\u2019s degree of sickness. We speculate that by the time infants are admitted to the neonatal unit, clinicians have greater access to routine monitoring and would readily re-check abnormal levels of pCO2 by blood gas analysis, hence, limiting the degree of fluctuation between extremes of values and thereby achieving tighter control. This would explain our findings that it is the delivery suite levels of CO2 that are more influential regarding IVH development and why the extreme levels of carbon dioxide seen during resuscitation do not translate to neonatal unit levels of CO2 during the subsequent 72 h. We did not use volume targeted ventilation during the study period and this would have likely reduced fluctuations in CO2 levels on the NICU.",

            "text": "As previously mentioned [3], we did find low EtCO2 levels that were associated with IVH development, but this was no longer significant after adjustment for gestational age. Nevertheless, we highlight fluctuations in EtCO2 that are highly predictive of IVH development. Hence, it is important to avoid both high and low levels of EtCO2 during resuscitation. Our results emphasize that respiratory function monitoring should be helpful in the labour suite. It has been previously shown that resuscitators were unable to accurately assess chest wall movement [11, 12], and use of respiratory function monitoring (RFM) can result in less mask leak and a lower rate of excessive tidal volumes [13]. We have, however, previously emphasized that resuscitators must have appropriate training so they can accurately interpret the results of such monitoring in real time [14]. Eye tracking technology has demonstrated that providers spend more time looking at the exhaled tidal volume waveform data than any other RFM parameter to guide positive pressure ventilation [15] suggesting further training is required on the importance of EtCO2 levels during resuscitation.",

We monitored EtCO2 levels during resuscitation, yet on the neonatal unit, we have analysed levels of CO2 from blood gas measurements. Previous studies, however, have found EtCO2 to be as accurate as arterial monitoring when trending carbon dioxide levels [16]. We did not, however, measure cerebral blood flow in our cohort and hence, cannot speculate on the mechanisms behind our findings.",
