Given the urgent need for evidence to support clinical and public health decisions, researchers have begun summarising and analysing the published literature to aggregate current evidence in the form of systematic reviews [7] [8] [9] and bibliometric analyses. [10] [11] [12] Existing bibliometric analyses 11, 12 have provided overviews of the COVID-19 research landscape. However, they primarily focus on authorship, keyword, and collaboration patterns without identifying gaps in the literature. More recent work includes a living mapping and living systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which provides an up-to-date overview of the highest quality evidence on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. 13 However, to date, there has been no investigations of current gaps and future directions in COVID-19 research of all study designs and review types.",

As such, there was insufficient time to design, approve, and execute such trials. Furthermore, we did not search clinical registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which indexes clinical trials globally, as the focus of our study was published literature. From the time since our analysis, we observed an increased number of clinical trials and protocols being published and summarised. 13 Another observation is the paucity of technology-related articles in the COVID-19 medical literature. While digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the internet have positively impacted public health intervention strategies 24 and shown promising applications in infectious disease contexts, 25 few have looked into their applications in COVID-19 research. Despite the straightforward application of AI technology (in particular, deep learning) 26 in analysing medical images, there was only one such study on chest computed tomography (CT) within articles on radiology. 27 Furthermore, despite the high volume of articles on epidemiology, current literature mainly adopted traditional techniques 28 to analyse COVID-19 dynamics 29-31 and forecast trends in the COVID-19 pandemic 32 and its trajectory. 33 Traditional statistical methods rely heavily on underlying assumptions which do not apply to medical data which are multidimensional, dynamic, and highly nonlinear as unpredictable human-environment interactions are involved. 25 More robust and complex modelling has many promising public health applications in COVID-19, 34 with similar methods already validated in tuberculosis and gonorrhoea epidemic control 35 and malaria policy. 36 The utility of such models extends to lesser investigated areas in COVID-19 research including social media and public reaction analysis. 37, 38 As observed in our evidence maps on topic and speciality, apart from articles which focussed primarily on infectious and respiratory diseases, there have been substantial works in preventive medicine and radiology, as well as some articles from population-specific specialities such as paediatrics and obstetrics and gynaecology. However, few articles are seen in all other specialities, leaving obvious gaps in research. For instance, acute kidney and cardiac injury were among the top adverse clinical complications observed in COVID-19 patients with severe disease, 22 which should prompt more research on the pathophysiology of .

Quarantine, a common public health measure globally in this pandemic, has significant psychological impacts on those affected. 39 Also, COVID-19 patients and their families can face undue stress as a result of self-blame, fear of transmitting the virus, and uncertainties regarding their health. These are just a few of a multitude of factors that contribute to high psychological stress in persons with and without COVID-19. Regrettably, one of the first research articles exploring the mental health of health care workers in this pandemic was only published at the end of our study's inclusion period. 40 While other viewpoints, 41, 42 guidelines, 43 and research 44 on mental health have subsequently surfaced, mental health and psychiatry in all populations remain grossly underrepresented even within the latest literature. Other major clinical settings to explore include but are not limited to neurology, 45 anaesthesiology, 46 cancer, 47 pathology, and geriatrics. It is also important to note that the impact of this pandemic extends beyond COVID-19 patients, 48 highlighting the importance of providing high-quality, equal, and continuous care to non-COVID-19 patients.

Unlike SARS, many COVID-19 patients are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic 59 , which makes screening and identification of cases extremely difficult and leaves the public at risk of infection. The gold standard test based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is accurate but is time-consuming, while alternative rapid test kits are fast and make point-of-care diagnosis possible but have shown disappointing performance to date. In general, the current diagnostic tools and technologies are not readily available for large-scale, population-based screening of COVID-19, leaving much room for future research.",

For instance, to what extent will a vaccine slow the spread COVID-19? Are repeated infections possible and, if so, how long after the first infection? What is the quality of life among survivors with severe disease? What are effective public health measures at the national and international levels that can retard SARS-CoV-2 transmission while minimising the impact on global citizens and the global economy? Are current infection control measures in prehospital and hospital settings sufficient and, if not, how can they be improved? We should note that the damage of COVID-19 has propagated far beyond the healthcare sector into almost all other industries. Furthermore, while conditions in some countries are beginning to ease, conditions in others are deteriorating. With the evidence maps investigated in our study, we hope to unveil some of the critical gaps and blind spots within the initial body of COVID-19 research and provide meaningful direction for future research.",

Firstly, our search period did not fully encapsulate the period in which the majority of COVID-19 cases shifted from China to Europe and the USA. Therefore, the results do not fully describe the most recent research landscape due to the exclusion of newly published articles. Furthermore, we did not search other databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which would have excluded most clinical trial protocols. Also, only English language articles were analysed which resulted in the exclusion of articles from Chinaa substantial source of early COVID-19 literature. Lastly, the exclusion of non-peer reviewed research (those archived in medRxiv and bioRxiv) in our analysis may have neglected some new evidence but ensured the inclusion of only scientific results that have undergone peer review.",

Other underexplored areas of research include the pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems and populations, the use of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence in forecasting trends and improving prevention and intervention strategies, and the indirect effects of the pandemic on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. We opine that the systematic identification and filling of such gaps in the literature will be vital in informing and shaping effective, evidence-based governmental policies and healthcare practices, which can translate to improved outcomes.",
