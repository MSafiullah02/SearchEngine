Its origin dates back to 1965, when the College of American Pathologists published the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology, which was later broadened to cover other fields of medicine. The merger of SNOMED RT (Reference Terminology) and the United Kingdom's Clinical Terms Version 3 (also known as Read Codes) in 1999 gave rise to SNOMED CT. Efforts to promote SNOMED CT as the international standard clinical terminology began in earnest in 2007, when the SNOMED CT intellectual property rights were transferred from the College of American Pathologists to the newly formed International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO).",

However, there is evidence that SNOMED CT-related research and implementation activities are on the rise. [3] [4] [5] In the United States, the \"Meaningful Use\" incentive program for electronic health record (EHR) usage now requires the use of SNOMED CT for encoding data elements such as clinical problems, encounter diagnosis, and procedures. 6, 7 While, in the previous phase of the Meaningful Use program, either ICD-9-CM or SNOMED CT could be used for encoding clinical problems, going forward only SNOMED CT can be used. This change is in line with the general opinion that SNOMED CT is a better choice for encoding clinical information in the EHR.",

Its clinical modification (CM) has been used in the United States for classifying morbidity and mortality, reimbursement, creation of diagnosis-related groups, analysis of healthcare delivery, and epidemiological and clinical research. In order to generate ICD codes to support various administrative activities, many existing EHRs use ICD as a clinical terminology to directly encode clinical information. While ICD serves many important functions (which cannot be replaced by SNOMED CT), the fact that it is a statistical classification poses some limitations on its use in EHRs.

ICD-10-CM will include significantly more codes (68 000). However, the increase in granularity is not uniform, but, instead, is concentrated in specific chapters (eg, injury and external cause), and a big portion of the new codes are created by formulaic expansion (eg, laterality, episode of care). 17 Table 1 shows examples of the loss of specificity encountered when encoding diseases in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM, compared to SNOMED CT. Many rare congenital skin anomalies are encompassed by a single code in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and cannot be distinguished from each other. Lumping groups of diagnoses together occurs even for more common conditions like acidosis and brachial plexus disorders. The lack of specificity in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM will affect the ability of the EHR to deliver disease-specific clinical decision support, because diseases with very different etiologies and management strategies are lumped together in these terminologies.",

One unique feature of SNOMED CT is extensibility by post-coordination -the creation of new meaning by modifying or refining existing concepts. The only way to extend ICD is to add local extension codes, which (as the name implies) are only interpretable locally and are meaningless to an outside reader. With post-coordination, computability and interoperability are preserved. It is possible to determine equivalence and subsumption between existing concepts and post-coordinated expressions, so that postcoordinated expressions can be shared and integrated. Liu et al. 18 found that post-coordination could potentially increase SNOMED CT's coverage of summary-level clinical concepts from 80 to 96%. According to Campbell et al., 19 only 1.5% of problem list terms could not be represented in SNOMED CT with post-coordination. However, from an implementation perspective, post-coordination is nontrivial. Challenges include data entry interface design, data storage and retrieval, and computational requirements. In the study by Lee et al., 4 6 of the 13 healthcare organizations interviewed were able to use post-coordination in some way.",

            "text": "Clinical orientation ICD descriptions are often criticized by clinical users as being awkward. This is because ICD codes are closely related to statistical groupings for epidemiological and other purposes, and the descriptions need to reflect the inclusion and exclusion criteria for classification. For example, an unsuccessful tendon grafting operation will be coded in SNOMED CT simply as 281430007 Failure of tendon graft. In ICD-9-CM, the corresponding code is E878.2 Surgical operation with anastomosis, bypass, or graft, with natural or artificial tissues used as implant causing abnormal patient reaction, or later complication, without mention of misadventure at time of operation. Since such descriptions cannot be used directly in data entry, the ICD implementers often need to create interface terms that clinical users can readily recognize. There is no such need in SNOMED CT, because the terms in SNOMED CT are words and phrases directly used in clinical discourse. Additionally, in some areas of ICD (eg, causes of injury), the emphasis seems to be more on public health than the individual patient. Extreme examples (eg, burning water-skis, turtle bite) have been used as jokes about ICD-10-CM. 20 Given that the primary purpose of the original ICD classifications was to collect global epidemiological data, rather than patient clinical data, it is understandable why mechanisms of injury are given such attention. To implement effective preventive measures, one would need detailed statistics. However, exposing these detailed injury codes to clinicians and requiring their use is likely to cause confusion and opposition.",

To facilitate counting and ensure data comparability, only codes at the lowest level (the leaf codes) can be used. To satisfy these requirements, two special types of codes are necessary: the \"unspecified\" (also known as \"not otherwise specified\" or NOS) and \"not elsewhere classified\" (or NEC) codes. The unspecified codes are used when specific information is missing. For example, 480.0 Viral pneumonia, unspecified is used when the medical record does not contain the specific virus causing pneumonia. The unspecified code is necessary, since the parent code 480 Viral pneumonia (which essentially conveys the same meaning as Viral pneumonia, unspecified) cannot be used. NEC codes are used when there is additional specific information in the medical record, but no corresponding specific code. Pneumonia caused by Human metapneumovirus is coded as 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified, since there is no specific code for this condition. In data entry, clinical users may be confused by the NOS and NEC codes. In SNOMED CT, there are no NOS and NEC codes.

The subtle change in the meaning of NEC codes is even more problematic, because it is difficult to detect (since the code and its description remain the same). This is called semantic drift, in Cimino's desiderata paper. 21 For example, the code 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified included SARS Pneumonia before 2003, but not afterwards, because 480.3 Pneumonia due to SARSassociated coronavirus was added.",

CORE stands for \"clinical observations recording and encoding\" and refers to the use of controlled terminologies to encode clinical information at a summary level, such as the problem list, discharge diagnosis, or reason for encounter sections of an EHR. 22 The CORE Subset was created empirically by identifying the most commonly used problem list terms that accounted for 95% of total usage in each institution and mapping them to SNOMED CT. 22 The main reason for adopting a usage-based cut-off was that all the datasets had very long tails of infrequently used terms. By focusing on the frequently used terms, we made the mapping effort more manageable.

We constructed new CORE Subsets using any seven of the eight datasets and calculated their coverage of frequently used SNOMED CT concepts and total usage for the \"left-out\" dataset.

We started with an initial base CORE Subset built from the two biggest and two smallest datasets (based on number of local terms), then added other datasets one by one, in all possible orders. For each addition, we noted the size of the starting CORE Subset and the coverage of the frequently used SNOMED CT concepts in the incoming dataset. Our hypothesis is that, as the CORE Subset gets bigger, the term coverage of the incoming dataset will increase and fewer new concepts will be added. The CORE Subset will grow at a progressively slower rate and eventually level off or only change very slowly. We examined the relationship between CORE Subset size and term coverage by scatter plot and by calculating the correlation coefficients (Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman). We used linear regression to estimate the potential ceiling of the CORE Subset. We used IBM SPSS V C for Windows (version 21) for statistical analysis. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the eight datasets and their mappings to SNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, and ICD-10-CM. The problem list vocabularies varied considerably in the number of unique terms, but all had a long tail of infrequently used terms. Across all datasets, 22.8% of unique terms accounted for 95% of usage. On average, 93.1% of the frequently used local terms within the 95% usage range could be mapped to SNOMED CT. These SNOMED CT-mapped terms corresponded to an average usage of 90.5%. An average of 43.4 and 49.9% of the frequently used terms could be mapped to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively, corresponding to usage coverage of 48.4 and 59.3%. Table 3 summarizes the results of the \"leave-one-out\" analysis. The average size of the CORE Subsets based on seven datasets was 5758, and this covered, on average, 80.3% of the frequently used SNOMED CT concepts in the left-out dataset. The average usage coverage was 83.7%. Among the frequently used SNOMED CT concepts not covered by the CORE Subset, 55% were direct parents or children of CORE concepts. It was more common to find a CORE parent (45.3%) than a child (20.7%), meaning that the missing concepts were generally more specific than the CORE concepts.",

It is likely that one would see a lower overall coverage of local terms in a dataset where not all the terms are mappable to SNOMED CT. On the other hand, the high usage coverage is consistent with our results. For the three smallest datasets (IH, RI, and BI), which are comparable to the Wright dataset, the average usage coverage was 90.8%.",

Whether this will result in a convergent, stable subset if we incorporate more datasets is an open question. One prerequisite for convergence is that frequently used concepts are clustered and not randomly distributed in SNOMED CT. There is evidence for such clustering. A CORE Subset of approximately 5000 concepts, corresponding to only 5% of SNOMED CT clinical concepts, already covers 80% of the frequently used concepts in any dataset. Furthermore, over half of the frequently used concepts not covered are direct parents or children of CORE concepts. As we showed in our previous study, the most heavily used terms are also the ones most likely to be shared among institutions. 22 In this study, we found a significant positive correlation between the size of the CORE Subset and the coverage of frequently used terms in an incoming dataset. If this relationship holds for future datasets, fewer and fewer new terms will need to be added, and the CORE Subset will plateau, resulting in a relatively stable subset. According to the regression formula, term coverage will approach 100% with a subset size of 8000 concepts.
