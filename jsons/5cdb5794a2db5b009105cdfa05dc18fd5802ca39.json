Particular attention has been paid to distinguishing between local and distant effects of amino acid substitutions on Ia function and to determining which residues interact with peptide antigen and which (if any) with the TCR. This ex erimental approach has led to the identification of several regions of the pofvorphic amino-terminal domains of the a and p chains as playing critical roles in chain-chain association and quaternary Ia conformation. The a1 and p l putative helical regions have been found to have distinct degrees of structural lability, with the a1 helix showing much greater susceptibility to conformational change due to allelic variation in other re ions of the molecule. Allelically polymor hic residues in the a1 and p 1 domainstave been shown to play important roles in &e activity of the assembly/folding control regions, and hence, analysis of local binding roles of specific residues in Ia molecules must take this additional effect of substitutions at these positions into account. By controlling for large scale conformational effects, individual residues in the p chain have been assigned to desetopic ( eptide interaction) and histotopic (TCR interaction) roles. In the cytochrome c molel, a putative peptide bindin \"pocket\" involvin residues from both the postulated p l a helix and also the p-stran% floor has been defined, residues controlling both the extent of binding and the orientation of the bound peptide have been identified, and at least one residue with TCR interaction potential without obvious peptide binding properties has been localized. Combining these data with those of other investigators leads us to propose a general model of class I1 MHC structure-function relationships. We have shown previously that memory B cells transferred into K-allotype distinct congenic rats in the absence of any priming antigen are deleted from the adoptive host within a matter of weeks (half-life of 1-2 weeks). In contrast co-injection of antigen with the cells facilitates their survival and the maintenance of a donor response for periods in excess of one year. In the experiments reported here we ask if the persistence of T cell memory is also dependent on antigen. 10. carrier (KLH) primed T cells were transferred in the presence or absence of antigen into irradiated, K-allotype distinct adoptive host. A t various times after transfer these rats were injected with 2x10' hapten-carrier (DNP-KLH) primed B cells together with 50 Ig of soluble DNP-KLH. This limiting number of B cells makes a secondary type response only if carrier-specific memory T cells survive in the adoptive host. We found that already at 6 weeks following transfer without antigen, no memory T cell help was available for these B cells. In contrast T cells transferred together with 10 ~g KLH provided help for secondary type donor responses at 6 and 12 weeks after transfer. We conclude that longterm memory at both the T and B cell levels does not reside with small, very long-lived, resting cells but. with active clones that are maintained by small amounts of antigen that may persist for long periods. Once antigen is lost from lymphoid tissues both T and B cell memory wanes within a relatively short time. T cells recognize antigen in the form of short peptides associated to class I or class I1 MHC molecules. Each MHC molecule has the ability to bind a large number of peptides and peptides with unrelated sequences can compete for binding to the same MHC molecule, as well as in vitro. In vivo competition strictly correlates with the capacity of the competitor peptide to bind to the MHC molecule presenting the antigenic peptide and its extent dependes on the molar ratio between antigen and competitor.",

Thus, the H L peptides 1-18 and 25-43 are both generated by HEL processing and are both able to bind to the I-E molecule but only 1-18 becomes immunodominant because it has th ability to compete in vivQ with other HEL peptides, such as 25-43, for the available sites on the I-E molecule. However, two immunodominant T cell epitopes, such as those in HEL peptides 51-66 and 112-129, both interacting with I-Ak molecules, do not compete with each other when injected together at equimolar concentrations. Such a coexistance is anticipated between peptides that bind with relatively high affinity to the presenting molecule and thus have both the chance to occupy a number of binding sites sufficient for T cell activation. r v s e III xen ic tr lantation.

Culture of thymus tissue in 2-deoxyguanosine (2dGua) is thought to reduce tissue immunogenicity by selectively depleting highly immunogenic, thymic immigrants of bone marrow origin. In the mouse 2dGua treated thymus tissue survival is markedly enhanced compared to untreated tissue when transplanted under the kidney capsule of allogeneic recipients. These experiments were repeated in the rat. As expected, strain DA neonatal thymus tissue was rejected when transplanted under the kidney capsule of normal allogeneic strain PVG rats.",

            "text": "Surprisingly. acute rejection occurred even when the tissue was cultured for 14 days in 4 mM PdGua (3x the effective dose in mice). By in vitro criteria this dose was very effective in destroying thymocytes. To test whether residual marrow derived cells that escaped PdGua treatment were responsible for inducing rejection we \"parked\" the 2dGua treated DA tissue in T cell depleted PVG rats. Our working hypothesis was that the few remaining donor derived cells of marrow origin would be overgrown by host type cells. When PdGua-treated DA thymus tissue was transplanted into T cell depleted PVG recipients graft rejection did not occur. However DA PdGua treated thymus tissue, parked for as long as 200 days in T cell depleted PVG rats, was acutely rejected when retransplanted into normal PVG recipients. We interpret these results to suggest that rat thymic epithelium devoid of marrow derived cells is innately immunogenic. c 104",

LFAl is a dimeric membrane molecule composed of a specific alpha chain (CDlla) and a beta chain (CD18) common to three members of the LFA family. LFAl is physiologically expressed on all white blood cells, while other molecules of the LFA family (with CDllb and CDllc alpha chains) are restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. A defective expression of LFAl has been described in some congenital immune deficiency and in AIDS. We investigated the LFAl defect on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 100 HIV+ patients. Three different monoclonal antibodies were used, respectively directed to chain-specific epitopes of CDlla (SPVL7, Sanbio) and CD18 (IOT18, Immunotech) and to a conformational epitope involving both chains (IOT16, Immunotech). Cell suspensions were stained in indirect immunofluorescence and a flow cytometer (Epics Profile, Coultronics) was used to assess the percentages of stained cell, the fluorescence intensity and the shape of fluorescent peaks. Our data suggest that LFAl expression is impaired in HIV+ patients both through the quantitative expression of each chain and through conformational alterations. The adhesion molecule LFA-1 is known to be important in antigen presentation. We have previously shown that both monocyte and T cell LFA-1 play a role in the interaction between these two cells (EJI D; 943, 1987) . Antibody to ICAM-1 (known to act as a ligand for LFA-1) also inhibits antigen presentation, although ICAM-1 is not thought to be expressed on resting T cells (EJI 18: 35, 1988) . We have looked at the expression of ICAM-1 on T cells after incubation with 12 cytokines and found that only IL-2 consistently effects an increase in both the percentage of ICAM-1 positive cells and in the level of expression. In addition we have found that a proportion of resting T cells express very low levels of ICAM-1. Double labelling experiments have shown that these cells are part of the memory T cell population as defined by antibodies to UCHLI, LFA-3 and LFA-1, and furthermore that ICAM-1 negative cells are unable to respond to to antigens such as PPD and Flu but are able to respond to PHA. This suggests that ICAM-1 represents an additional marker on the memory T cell population which more precisely defines the subset able to respond to recall antigens ICAM-1 EXPRESSION ON T CELLS, Anne-Marie Buckle and Nancy Hogg, Macrophage Lab.

CTL recognize peptide forms of processed, foreign antigens in association with class I molecules of the MHC and are usually directed against endogenously synthesized \"cellular antigens\" such as those expressed by virusinfected cells. In vifro studies have shown that small exogenous peptides can directly associate with class I molecules on the cell surface and mimic the target complex derived by intracellular processing and presentation. We have recently generated OVA-specific, H-2Kb-restricted CTL by immunizing C57BL/6 mice with a syngeneic tumor line transfected with the OVA cDNA. The CTL recognize the OVA transfectant EG7-OVA and the synthetic peptide OVA but fail to recognize the native protein. We reasoned that given the potential for direct peptide/class ?'&$%ation observed in vifro, OVA2s,-2ra may induce CTL after in vivo priming. However, we found that this is not the case. OVA,,,-,,, and peptides of increasing lengths up to which are all able to form the target complex in vitro, are inefficient at priming ~% -%~~ specific ?h%sponses following intravenous injection.

Immunization of SJL/J mice with myelin basic protein (MBP) induces the T cell-mediated autoimmune central nervous system disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Response against a dominant epitope (residues 89-101) leads to disease. Lymph node T cells from MBP-immune mice react against several epitopes in addition to 89-101 indicating that the I-As molecule is able to form immunogenic complexes with several MBP peptides. The question asked in these studies was whether subdominant epitopes from the same molecule would compete with the dominant epitope for binding sites on the I-AS molecule. To address this question two T cell clones, one specific for 89-101 (SP4.2) and a second specific for a second epitope present in peptide 89-170 (SP4.7) were tested for responsiveness when cultured with the dominant epitope alone or with mixtures of peptides containing dominant and subdominant epitopes. Reactivity of SP4.2 against peptide 89-101 was inhibited by peptides 1-37 and 43-88. Reactivity of SP4.7 against peptide 89-170 was not inhibited by peptide 89-101 although peptides 1-37 and 43-88 were inhibitory. Controls indicated that inhibitory reactivity was not due to toxicity at high concentrations of peptides. These findings imply that subdominant epitopes are able to compete with dominant epitopes of MBP for binding sites on I-As molecules. Linda R. Gooding, Frances C . Rawle, David I .

I n several v i r u s systems e a r l y non-structural proteins localized predominantly i n the nucleus of infected cells are major t a r g e t antigens f o r cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Whether early synthesis o r nuclear l o c a l i z a t i o n are important factors i n immunodominance is not known. W e have recently developed a system f o r studying the CTL response t o human group C adenoviruses i n mice. By us ng both transfected t a r g e t s and virus deletion mutants w e have shown t h a t , response t o wild type AD5. There are two E1A t r a n s c r i p t s , 12s and 1 3 s . which both encode major e a r l y nuclear antigens d i f f e r i n g by a 46 amino a c i d insertion: both antigens are recognized equally w e l l by CTL.

However, the presence of gpl9K i n the priming v i r u s does not a f f e c t the s p e c i f i c i t y of the CTL generated f o r E l A , so the immunodominance of t h i s protein cannot be due t o the fact t h a t i t is the only major protein synthesized before gpl9K i n the course of infection. Using virus deletion mutants we are investigating whether CTL s p e c i f i c f o r other Ad5 antigens can be induced i n the absence of ElA, and whether E1A is also the dominant antigen recognized i n mice of other MHC haplotypes. respond to antigens present on non-replicative virions. In contrast, we have obtained BALC/c I-Erestricted T hybridomas specific for the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein of A/PR8 influenza which recognize infectious, but not non-replicative virus, closely resembling recognition requirements observed for most class I MHC-restricted responses to influenza. Recognition correlated with the rte nova synthesis of viral NA within antigen-presenting cells, but did not depend strictly upon the amount of NA present in cultures, since high NA concentrations could be achieved by addition of non-replicative virus without being stimulatory for NA-specific T cells. Recognition of a neo-antigen was ruled out, since, in high concentration, NA isolated from purified virions, even if reduced and alkylated, was recognized by the T hybridoma clone. Isolated NA was recognized when added to pre-fixed APC, suggesting that this form of antigen was able to bypass the usual processing pathway of exogenous proteins. This suggests that endogenously-synthesized antigen may use different pathways to achieve class 11-associated presentation. T lymphocyte activation is a complex event which is influenced by a variety of distinct cell surface molecules. In order to determine the role of individual molecules in the activation process, we have developed an efficient methodology for generating cell variants in which expression of molecules is selectively inhibited by expression of anti-sense RNA from an Epstein-Barr virus episomal replicon. In a previous study, we reported that marked inhibition of CD8 cell surface expression could be achieved in a human T cell clone using this approach. We have now extended this strategy to another T cell surface molecule, CD2, as a first ste towards ascertaining its role in T cell activation. To this end, we s nthesized a &-mer oli onucleotide corresponding to a sequence in. the 5: end of the c d i n g re ion of human CD'i and inserted it in an anti-sense orientation into this replicon. This a-C%2/REP3 construct was electroporated into Jurkat cells. Analysis of stable a-CD2IREP3 transfectants by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry demonstrated complete and selective inhibition of CD2 expression. In contrast to the nontransfected arent, this CD2-variant demonstrated a partial loss in its ability to form conjugates a n 8 to secrete interleukin 2 when stimulated with anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies. However, stimulation of the CD2-variant with A23187 and PMA did result in interleukin 2 secretion. Several observations suggest that CD8 functions not only as an adhesion molecule recognising MHC class I on the adjacent cells but also potentiate the transducting capacity of the TCR/CDg complex. Comparison of the mouse Ly 2 protein sequence with the homolog rat OX8 and human T8 sequences revealed most highly conserved regions in the membrane and cytoplasmic part of the molecule. The conservation of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences in different species may be significant for the function of the CD8 molecule. In order to initiate the functional dissection of the CD8-molecule we constructed mutations in different parts of the molecule. By transfecting the a and B chain genes donated by a CD8 dependent cytotoxic T cell clone(KB5 C20) into the MHC class I1 restricted agd CD4 T cell hybridoma DO-11.10 we were able to reconstitute the ability to respond to K only if the transfer was done with the Ly 2 molecules (Gabert et al., 1987.

We have simulated graft versus host and host versus graft reactivity in vitro by studying primary anti-minor H responses in a limiting dilution culture system. The ability of BMM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) to stimulate and respond in this system were compared by estimating the number of proliferating cells. In GvH-direction the combination of donor-BMM (d-BEIM) and host-PBM (h-PBM) was 2 to 15 times more effective in stimulating proliferation than any other combination; the same applied to the combination h-PBM/d-BMM in HvG-direction.-Using these combinations the median frequency of proliferating cells in GvH-direction was 1/5300 (range 1/59C-1/18100) in 10 pairs, in HvG-direction (7 pairs) 1/2330 (range 1/115-1/6100). 85% of the proliferating cells had the phenotype of mature T-cells.-Using the same combination of responder/stimulator cells we have also estimated the number of cytotoxic cells specific for the HLA-identical target cell.

By split well analysis similar or higher frequencies of cytotoxic cells with specificity for NK-targets were detected (GvHR: 1/5750, HvGR: 1/3620). It was however possible to identify a significant number of minor H-specific clones by segregation analysis; their specificity could be confirmed after clonal expansion.

It is not known what makes that some transfusions inrrmnise the recipient whereas others induce immune suppression. We investigated if certain MHC compatibilities or differences between recipient and transfusion donor and organ donor are required to induce the beneficial \"transfusion effect\" in man. We studied graft survival and blood transfusion induced changes in cellular and humoral immunity in 4 different patient groups. The patients received a single blood transfusion of a randomly choosen donor. We found in all 4 groups that to induce a beneficial \"transfusion effect\" compatibility for at least 1 HLA-DR antigen between recipient and transfusion donor is required. If the transfusion and recipient are mismatched for both MA-DR antigens, the recipient is immunised, resulting in an increased antibody production (P=O.OOl), an increased cytoxicity (CML) (P=O.OOS), an increased mixed lymfocyte reaction (MLR) (P=O.OOS) and a decreased graft survival (P-0.003). After a beneficial (MA-DR sharing) transfusion. the in vitro test remain unchanged or decrease.

Since gp120 and class I1 both interact Kith CD4, we have used our functional assay to verify if gp120 exerts an inhibitory function on CD4 class I 1 interaction. Recombinant gp120 inhibits the functional interaction and rosette formation in a concentration dependent fashion with maximal inhibition at about 10 pg/ml.. This inhibition is specific since it can be reversed by recombinant soluble CD4. The fact that recombinant. gp120 can inhibit the functional interaction between CD4 and its physiological ligand (class I1 Ags) suggests that the use of gp120 on a vaccine against HIV infection could alter the immune response of such individuals. This work was supported by SRC, MRC and NCI. T lymphocytes discern self from non-self molecules through the interaction of their antigen-specific receptors and proteins encoded by the MHC. Although the nature of this association is not well-defined, a model has been proposed whereby the v-segments of the T cell receptor interact with residues along the 2 alpha helices of the class I antigen (Davis et al.; 334:395, 1988) . We have recently shown that CTL generated against the class I molecule QIOd crossreact on several unrelated murine class I antigens containing the shared QIOd residues at amino acid positions 152, 155, and 156 (Mann et al.; J X 168:307, 1988) . These residues contributed by the a-2 domain occur in the alpha helical portion of the class I molecule and amino acids 152 and 155 could interact directly with the T cell receptor. To further characterize the role of these amino acids, we are in the process of determining whether insertion of these 3 residues by site-directed mutagenesis into a human class I molecule will allow for the antigen's recognition by anti-910 CTL. Here the T cell repertoire becomes restricted, so that foreign antigen can be recognized only when associated with the MHC products of the host, and mature T cells are tolerized to self antigens, a process which also seems to be MHC-restricted. Thus, T cells should be non-reactive to self antigens when they are associated with MHC products present on the tolerance-inducing thymic cells, whereas they may still react to the same self antigens when associated with different MHC products.",

In the case of T-cell responses against viruses such response defects are associated with a marked increase in disease susceptibility as illustrated by class I MHC controlled susceptibility to lethal pneumonia induction by Sendai virus. Certain class I or class I1 MHC determined TC response defects (four out of six tested by us) can be restored by imunization in vivo and/or restimulation in vitro with DC. DC are the most effective APC. Their superior APC capacity is due to 1) a very high absolute number of class I and class I1 MHC molecules, and 2 ) a low degree of sialylation of MHC and other surface molecules, reducing negative charge and facilitating access of the T-cell receptor to the MHC groove presenting the antigenic peptide and/or improved clustering with T cells. The more effective antigen presentation by DC allows a more prominent role for a CD4+ Q cell independent pathway of CD8+ TC activation. It is postulated that the more effective direct triggering of CD8+ Tc precursors lowers the threshold for IL-2 production by CD8+ cells, reducing the requirement for IL-2 production by the CD4+ cells. Failure of DC to overcome certain MHC-linked specific TC response defects probably reflects complete failure of any foreign peptide derived from the processed antigen to interact efficiently with the MHC or a true Tc repertoire defect.",

Interleukin-2 activated killer (IAK) lymphocytes (also known as LAK cells) which destroy a broader spectrum of tumors invitro than NK cells have been used sucessfully in an adoptive immuno-therapy protocol for the treatment of patients with a variety of advanced cancers. The cell suface molecule(s) on tumor cells that a r e involved in specific binding to IAK cells and in programming IAK cells for cytolysis (IAK acceptor molecules) have not been characterized. Inorder to identify such acceptor molecules a crude membrane digest of the lung carcinoma cell line A549 was biotinylated and adsorbed to IAK cells or to unstimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (UPBL) (each from the same person). Proteins from the washed solubilized cells were separated by PAGE, Western Blotted and probed with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. Several experiments demonstrated that different tumor membrane proteins bound to IAK cells compared to UPBL. The unstimulated cells bound one tumor membrance protein (about 40KD) not found on the IAK-adsorded blot. The IAK cells bound three tumor proteins (approximately 30,46 & 50KD) not found on the UPBL-adsorded blot. Three other proteins (about 35,44 & 55KD) were found to adhere equally well t o IAK cells and UPBL. Utilizing a streptavidin affinity column, solubilized tumor membrane proteins that bound to IAK cells could be separated from solubilized IAK membrane proteins. The isolated tumor membrane proteins that adsorded to IAK cells inhibited IAK mediated lysis of A549 tumor cells by >85%. These studies suggest that specific cellular adsorption techniques may be useful in isolating and characterizing tumor membrane proteins involved in interactions unique to cytolytic lymphocyte-tumor cell target binding and lysis. Activation of human T lymphocytes occurs via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex but can also be induced through the non-antigen-specific CD2 molecule. Selected combinations of mAbs or the soluble CD2 ligand, namely LFA-3 and a unique anti-CDZ mAb (CD2.1) induce human T cell activatlon. CD4 is an accessory molecule implicated in t h e activation of human T lymphocytes. This molecule may exert this function by increasing intercellular avidity through binding to MHC class I1 molecules and/or by transmitting intracellular signals. We have investigated the action of mAbs directed against different epitopes on the CD4 molecules in the activation of human T cells via the CDZ pathway. We show that anti-CD4 mAbs inhibit CD2 induced T cell proliferation in an epitope-depe dent fashion. This inhibition does not appear to be linked to the lower CD2 mediated [ C a ' + ] response induced by anti-CD4 mAbs, since [Ca\"] response is equally affected by anti-CD4 mAbs whether or not they inhibi ed T cell proliferation. In conclusion, the partial inhibition of the CD2 induced [Cb'] response of T cells by various anti-CD4 mAbs suggest that : 1) this inhibition does not totally account for the inhibitory effect of anti-CD4 mAbs, 2) and the proliferation induced by anti-CDZ mAbs may not be completely ascribed to the [Ca2+] response of T cells.

These events seem to be linked to the interaction between T-cell precursors and the stromal cells of the thyms. Thus increasing evidence points to an essential role for the thymus epithelial cells (TE cells) in development of at least HEC class I1 recognition by the T cells. To be able to study the importance of TE cells in T cell maturation. we have developed a method for growing murine T cells in serum-free Pediun with well defined constituents. The m d i u a allows far growth of TE cells without concomitant growth of bone marrow derived cells as macrophages and fibroblasts. Data obtained by EN and lmmunocytochenistry showing the epithelial nature of the cultured cells, as well as autoradiographic data on the growth pattern, and characterization of TB cell supernatants will be provided in addition to results obtained from co-culture of TE cells and T-cell precursors (CM-CDS-thymytes). lmmunogenicity c 152 Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892 The effector limb mediating skin allograft rejection is highly antigen specific, rejecting cells that express allogeneic MHC antigens while sparing those which fail to express allogeneic MHC determinants. disparate skin grafts are completely rejected in spite of the fact that only a small percentage of the cells within the graft express Ia antigens. Thus, it is possible that MHC class I1 disparate grafts are rejected by a mechanism that does not assess the expression of MHC determinants on each cell. We assessed the specificity of the rejection of Ia disparate grafts by using allophenic skin grafts in an adoptive transfer system and concluded that skin grift rejection across an MHC class I1 disparity required recognition of allo-Ia determinants expressed by every cell in the graft. Therefore, we reasoned that MHC class I1 antigens must be induced on these Ia negative populations. Indeed, injection of mice with gamma interferon dramatically induced Ia antigens on previously negative keratinocytes. We next tested whether the induction of allogeneic Ia determinants on keratinocytes was necessary for graft rejection by engrafting parental strain mice with skin from F >parent bone marrow chimeras. Such grafts failed to be rejected, in spite of the speciic rejection of the allogeneic Langerhans cells, indicating that the failure of keratinocytes to express allogeneic class I1 determinants leads to graft preservation. conclusion, MHC class I1 disparate skin allografts are rejected in a highly antigen specific fashion, secondary to the induction of MHC class I1 antigens on skin cells that fail to constitutively express them. To address whether the extensive polymorphism characteristic of class I molecules influences CD8 binding, we have screened a panel of transfectants expressing individual class I MHC alleles. Of 18 alleles tested, only Aw68.1 did not bind. All other molecules dld bind, including A2.1 and Aw69, which differ by 13 and 7 amino acids respectively from Aw68.1. Position 245 in the alpha 3 domain was identified by sitedirected mutagenesls as the critical residue differing between A2.1 and Aw68.1 which determines binding. A mutant Aw68.1 molecule containin alanine at position 245 bound CD8, while a mutant of A2.1 with valine at 245 did not. Alanine is found at position 245 of all human and murine class I molecules sequenced to date except Aw68.1 and Aw68.2, which have valine at that position. Bulk cultures of A2-allospecific CTL were also sensitive to this substitution, and preferenhally recognized both molecules with alanine at 245. This study shows that Aw68.1 differs from other class I molecules in its capacity to bind CD8, and raises the possibility that Aw68.1 may not function as a restriction element as effectively as other class I alleles.

Different AFT populations were tested for their capacity to present SpreSZ particles to these T cell hybridomas. Various macmphage like populations such as resident, Con A induced, Thiiglycolate induced peritoneal exudate cells as well as splenic adherent cells were found to present efficiently the SpreS2 antigen. In conhast B cells and la+ B cell lines (TA3, M12.4) could not function as accessory cells in the SpreSZ specific stimulation of these T cell hybridomas. The inability of these cells to present this antigen was not due t o inhibitory effects since these cells did not inhibit the presentation capacity of other potent APC's. Funhcnnore addition of APC's of a different haplotype could not complement for the defective presentatiW of SpreSZ by B cells and B ceU lines indicating that MHC independent accessory factors are not implicated in this process.

HEL was internalized quickly into acidic compartments when targeted to IgD but was detected much later when targeted to MHC molecules, as assessed by shifts of fluorescent signal of internalized FITC-HEL. However, the data indicate that not all endocytosed HEL entered low pH (<5.5) compartments. Degraded HEL was released from B cells following endocytosis of 125-I-HEL. This release was detected earlier with targeting to IgD than to MHC structures. Interestingly, the total amount of internal 125-I-HEL decreased with time after endocytosis via IgD, but the internal 125-I-HEL was almost entirely whole undegraded HEL at all times following endocytosis.

However, when mixtures of CTL and their specific targets are inoculated into the skin of hosts syngeneic to the CTL, host cells at the site of inoculation are destroyed, often to an extent that results in grossly observable, full -thickness necrotic lesions. We have evoked these \"innocent bystander\" reactions in mice with CTL directed against single and multiple non-H-2 antigens and TNPhapten and influenza A virus-specific antigens. Thus, the ability to trigger bystander tissue destruction appears to be a general characteristic of CTL-target cell interaction in vivo. Our current evidence suggests that host inflamatory cells recruited and activated by factors stimulated by CTL-target cell recognition actually mediate the tissue destruction. These CTL-initiated bystander reactions may be the basis of the non-specific tissue destruction that contributes to allograft rejection and that is observed in many serious virus infections and in intense DTH reactions and contact dermatitis.",

Although C5 deficient dca cannot secrete C5 they s t i l l synthesize a precursor mlecule, pro-C5, i n Accumulating evidence from a number of models suggests that unique subsets of antigenpresenting cells a r e responsible for the induction of specific T cell-mediated responses. W e have previously described an age-dependent maturational defect in the ability of the SJL strain of mice to activate DTH-inducer T cells to a wide variety of antigenic stimuli. None of the other 14 strains tested exhibited a similar defect and all other accessory cell dependent responses were unaffected in the DTH unresponsive SJL. W e have also shown that the adoptive transfer a macrophage from older DTH responsive SJL or other DTH responsive LAS strains can overcome this defect in DTH responsiveness. W e have recently found that a subpopulation with the Mac-I+, Mac-3' and Mac-2-surface phenotype a r e able to transfer responsiveness. FACS analysis indicate that the Mac-3 phenotype is expressed on less than 20% of macrophages. Titrations of the Mac-3' cells isolated by FACS indicate that adoptive transfer of o ly 100 Mac-3' cells can overcome the defect in DTH responsiveness. By contrast, transfer of 10 Mac 3-or Mac 2' cells were unable to overcome the defect. Our data suggest that the induction of CD4' antigen specific cells DTH-inducer T cells is mediated by a phenotypically unique small subset of macrophage accessory cells. In our studies, we have examined the effect of administering Fab' fragments of anti-L3T4 MoAb (Fabl-GK1.5) on the inhibition of humoral immunity. Treatment of KLH-primed mice with 0.5 mg Fabl-GK1.5 depleted L3T4' cells from lymph node tissue while leaving other lymphocyte subpopulations intact. After injection of KLH in complete Freund's adjuvant, these T,depleted mice were unable to produce anti-KLH antibodies. Long-lasting unresponsiveness against KLH (12 weeks) was observed despite the apparent regeneration of the T, population of the lymph node. The results obtained using either Fab' or intact GK1.5 antibody were comparable and suggest that a transient depletion of T, does not account entirely for the long-term humoral unresponsiveness. The aim of this study was to gain a more detailed insight into the molecular aspects of antigen processing during the imune response. As a first approach, endosomal vesicles were isolated from bovine alveolar macrophages and their proteolytic activity with respect to a model protein antigen, sperm whale myoglobin (Mb), was characterized. During the first stage of digestion of Mb by the endosomes, a limited number of fragments were preferentially released from the antigen. We have isolated and identified these fragments.",

Possibly, the observed selectivity of the enzyme may account for the structural similarities among T-cell epitopes, noted by others. Actively acquired tolerance in mice to the antigens of the MHC (H-2) is induced by exposure of the animals to allogeneic lymphocytes within 24 hours of birth. Actively acquired tolerance to the MHC in humans (HLA) cannot be studied in the same way. However, we have evidence for the existence of actively acquired tolerance in humans in a study of 26 highly sensitized patients waiting for a renal allograft. They had developed complement dependent antibodies to the HLA antigens of almost all unrelated Caucasoid donors. The sera of these highly sensitized patients were tested against a panel of lymphocytes that were mismatched for only one HLA class I antigen. We found for these 73 patients HLA class I antigens that, although different from those present in the recipient, did not lead to a positive crossmatch. We called such antigens \"permissible mismatches\" and show that they often included those HLA antigens of the patient's mother that the patient had not inherited (noninherited maternal antigens; NIMA). In 15 of the 26 patients, the permissible class I mismatches included the NIMAa. The noninherited paternal antigens (NIPAS) were analyzed as a control; only two of the 25 NIPAs tested were acceptable mismatches, which emphasized the preferential nonresponsiveness to NIMA. Recent experiments indicate that what holds true for antibody formation also holds true for T cell activation. of HLA class I and HIA class I1 allospecific CD8-positive CTL clones. Monoclonal antibodies (McAb) directed against the CD8 structure were only found to inhibit antigen-specific cytotoxicity of a series of class I allospecific CD8-positive CTL clones and not of a class I1 allospecific CD8-positive CTL clone. However cytotoxicity induced by CD3 McAb (used at suboptimal concentrations) or CD2 McAbs in both types of CTL clone was blocked by CD8 McAbs. The absence of CD8 McAb blocking of antigen-specific cytotoxicity of the class-11-specific CD8positive CTL clone may be explained by assuming that it results from a triggering signal which is to strong to be overcome by the down-regulatory signal of the CD8 antigen. These combined findings clearly suggest a functional involvement of CD8 not only in TCR/CD3 activation, but also in TCR/CD3 controlled alternative activation routes, such as the CD2 activation pathway. Moreover it shows that even an HLA class I1 allospecific CD8-positive CTL clone expresses a functional active CD8 antigen. The absence of HIA class I expression on the target cells (DAUDI cells) used in the experiments described indicate that the CD8 antigens not act solely in an adhesion-like fashion, but exhibit also a more general regulatory function in T-cell activation. This regulatory role of CD8 may be explained by assuming the induction of a threshold for activation, which is triggered after binding of CD8 McAb or binding to its natural ligand, HLA class I. In our view, CDE-mediated regulation of T-cell activation could therefore prevent non-specific triggering of cytotoxicity by interactions of insufficient affinity. *This study was supported by a grant from the Dutch Kidney Foundation.

In light of these findings, of apparent interest is the issue of which cells types are responsible for Hlsa-specific T cell tolerance induction. Studies in mice treated from birth with anti-p antibodies suggest an important but perhaps not exclusive role for B cells in this process.

UCHLl+ CD45R-lung lymphocytes responded poorly to PHA and ConA but did respond to IL-2 in the presence of accessory cells. Together these data suggest that lung lymphocytes are recently activated memory cells. IL-2 induced lung T cell lines were also characterized for antigen expression and w ( activity. High LAK activity was obtained in preparations containing a high proportion of CD8 cells. These cultures appeared to be suicidal. In contrast, lines with a high proportion of CD4+ had low or absent LAK activity but proliferated in the presence of IL-2 for at least 3 months expressing a CD2 CD45R-phenotype.

Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201. Murine type 2 helper T cells (Th2) secrete interleukin 4 (IL 4) in response to antigen. Despite the likely importance of these cells, little is known about their priming and expansion in vivo. We have demonstrated IL 4 production in response to a cytochrome p peptide following T cell expansion in vitro. This antigen has not previously been shown to induce Th2 cells. BIO.A mice were primed with a peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c in CFA. Lymph node cells were restimulated in vitro with antigen for 5-7 days, Ficolled and rested for 3 days without antigen. Cells were then tested by limiting dilution for the presence of antigen-specific IL 4 producing cells. IL 4 was detected using the IL 4 sensitive cell line CT4S (provided by Dr. W. E. Paul, NIH). The specificity of the response was confirmed by blocking with the anti-lL 4 antibody 11 B1 1. Following in vitro restimulation of the primed lymphocytes with antigen, IL 4 production was detectable from as few as1 03 cells per well. IL 4 secretion was antigen dependent and required both in vivo priming and restimulation in order to be detected. It is not clear why primed lymph node cells, placed in limiting dilution culture directly after removal from the animal, failed to secrete detectable amounts of IL 4 in response to antigen. Suppression is an unlikely mechanism as fresh primed lymph node cells were unable to inhibit IL 4 production by restimulated cells. We are now investigating the factors that may regulate the development of IL 4 producing T cells.",

Human TCR y6 occurs in disulphide-linked (Type 1) or non-disulphide-linked (Type 2) forms, dependent on the use of the Cyl or Cy2 gene segment. The CyZ gene segment can contain a duplication or triplication of exon 2 , which gives rise to different protein forms (Types 2bc or Zabc). It is not known whether functional differences exist between these receptor types. Protein chemical analysis of Type 1 and Type 2bc receptors on functional human T cell clones derived from peripheral blood (PB) has indicated that not only the y chains, but also the 6 chains have a molecular mass and charge which set apart Type 1 and q p e 2bc receptors. Two sets of fifteen clones were randomly generated from PB of two normal donors after selection with the anti-TCR y6-1 mAb, which recognizes all receptor types. DNA rearrangement and mRNA expression analysis of y and 6 genes allowed us to map the specificity of the anti-TCR y6 mAbs 6TCS-1 and TiyA to the V6l and Vy9 gene segments respectively. Subsequently it could be concluded from the analysis of random clones that the majority of Type 1 receptors use vy9, while this preference seems absent in Type 2 receptors. The great majority of Type 1 receptors do not use V6l. while the majority of Type 2 receptors do. This was confirmed by fluorescence analysis of PBL of a large panel of normal donors. We conclude that Vy and V6 gene segments in functional TCR y6 in PB are used in non random combination and that their expression is correlated with rearrangement of the y gene to Cyl or Cy2. We have previously shown that polymorphic residues in the NH2-tenninal half of the p1 domain (amino acids 1-48; hypervariable regions 1 and 2 [PHVl and 21) determine with which allelic or isotypic a chain a particular b chain can achieve efficient cell surface beterodimer expression. This result might be understood in terms of the current model for Ia smcture which predicts that W V l would lie adjacent to region. Therefore, to examine the role of aHVl residues in conmlling hetcroduncr expression. a mutant A d cDNA was created in which the codon for amino acid 11 was mutated to code for the Auk residue at this position. In addition, recombinant A d and A& cDNAs, in which the segments encoding the three a hypervariable regions were exchanged between the two alleles, were used to study the connibutions of other a chain polymorphisms to this process. Interestingly, the polymorphic residues in aHV2 are predicted to lie in a region of the A a chain a-helix which is adjacent to the pHV4 region of the p chain a-helix. Allelic substitutions in this latter region of AD have been shown to similarly affect surface Ia h e t e r o d i i expression.",

The aim of this project is to identify contact residues of the T cell receptor (TCR) with antigen and/or MHC class I1 molecules. As a model system, a Vp17-containing TCR has been chosen since the majority of VB17' T cell hybrids react with IE molecules of the k,s,d, and b haplotype. T cell hybrids have been made which have a dual reactivity: they are Vp17+ and recognize IE molecules but also show reactivity towards a known antigen, namely chicken ovalbumin (Ova). One such hybrid has been mutagenized with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). Mutants were selected on the basis of their survival after stimulation by either antigen or IE. It was expected that mutations in all different kind of genes involved in T cell recognition and T cell activation would be found. Mutants obtained fall into two major groups: 1) loss variants of TCR a or fl chains,T3 or L3T4: 2) mutants with point mutations in one of these genes. We are currently analyzing the mutants biochemically and functionally in order to identify the particular gene affected. Point mutations in the a and p genes of TCR mutants will be localized using the polymerase chain reaction in combination with dideoxy sequencing. Activation of T lymphocytes requires the intracellular fragmentation of foreign antigens and their presentation by class I or class I1 Major Histocompatibility Complex glycoproteins. The direct binding of peptides to class I1 molecules has been shown in a number of experimental systems and its specificity compared to that of T cell activation. In contrast, direct binding of peptides to class I molecules has been difficult to detect; although peptide sensitization experiments and the crystallographic structure of HLA-A2 persuasively argue for its occurence and importance.",

However, the frequency of CTL specific for other human alloantigens remained similar to that of normal mice. The frequency of HLA-A2.1 restricted influenza specific CTL was 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the frequency of H-2 restricted CTL. These results indicate that the poor response of murine CTL to human class I antigens is not determined by selection in the thymus, but by species-specific constraints on the interaction of MHC antigens with T-cell recognition structures. While the mice are tolerant to HLA-A2.I expressed on murine cells, they still respond to HLA-A2.1 expressed on human cells. The epitopes defined by such clones are present on HLA-A2.1 positive human cells derived from several different tissues. Such epitopeJ are not dependent upon the species of p2m associated with the class I molecule, nor upon the structure of the attached carbohydrate. The results suggest that one or more highly conserved normal human proteins contribute to the formation of such epitopes, and provide an explanation for the failure of CTL raised against class I molecules on human cells to recognize the same molecules expressed on murine transfectants. This suggests that normal endogenously expressed molecules may also be important in the formation of epitopes on class I antigens recognized by allospecific CTL.

Interestingly, the V73+ fetal cells express elevated levels of IL-2 receptor, indicating that they may have been activated. Functional analysis demonstrated that, unlike other fetal thymocytes, the V73+ cells can be stimulated to produce lymphokines and lyse a panel of target cells which are also lysed by the adult Thy-l+ dEC. These results raise the intriguing possibility that the first receptor-bearing component of the T cell system to appear in ontogeny might give rise to the Thy-]+ dEC. (3ritical to an understanding of the function of cells bearing the gamma-delta T cell receptor will be an understanding of when and where such cells function. In order to investigate this, we have used a variety of techniques (in situ hybridisation, cDNA cloning, and PCR) to examine m a s of TCR gamma delta gene expression. One conspicuous site of expression is the intestinal epithelium, which is by contrast almost devoid of TCR alpha beta expression. Interestingly, the V gene segment usage in this location is quite specific and is different to the specifcity that we have found in the spleen and in the thymus, and that others have found in the skin. This specificity suggests in turn that expression of the resmcting elements recognised by gamma delta may also be spatially nxticted. Extensive analysis of junctional diversity can pmvide infomation on the diversity of antigen nxogniscd by gamma delta.

A tryptic digest that retains activity has been fractionated by HPLC and the stimulatory component is being analyzed. Examination of the amino acid sequence of SEB and the proteolytic cleavage sites has led us to synthesize several peptides for analysis. These peptides, and their analogues, will be tested for their function in vivo and in vitro. To understand the interactions involved in the famation of peptide-MHC complexes, an assay has been developed to detect DR specific binding of peptide analogues of T e l l determinants to cell surfaces. EBV msformcd B cell lines (BCLs) w m incubated with biotinylated peptide followed by FlTC conjugated streptavidin, and then anaiysed by flow cytomctg. A panel of BCLs homoygous for diffmnt DR types bound analogues of peptide 307-319 from influenza virus haemagglutinin (previously shown to be a helper T cell determinant restricted through DR1) to varying degrees, w h m no binding was observed to the DR-BCL RJ225. Binding could be specifically inhibited by the natural unbiotinylated T cell determinant or other DRl restricted determinants. Competition by a range of peptides revealed quantitative diffmnces in their ability to bind DRl. The assay is currently being used to generate a detailed model of the complex formed betweenHA307-319andDRl. and Trp for Leul 6. and HLA-A2.3 differs from HLA-A2.I by the substitutions of Thr for Ala 4 9 Glu fo??a1152 and Trp for zeu156. Residues 9 and 95 in the 8-sheet of the molecule, and residues 149, 152, and 156 in the a-helix are thought to interact with bound peptide or the TCR. To evaluate the role of these residues on CTL-defined epitopes, two genes were constructed that encoded novel molecules which differ from HLA-A2.1 only at residues 9, 43, and 95, or at residue 156. The effect of a-helix substitutions on serologic and CTL-defined epitopes that varied between HLA-A2.I and HLA-A2.3 were evaluated by constructing genes that encoded the individual differences at residues 149, 152, and 156, as well as additional non-naturally occuring substitutions at these same positions. HLA-A2.1 specific CTL were found that were: (1) insensitive to substitutions at either residues 9, 43, and 95, or residue 156, but were lost when all four positions were changed; (2) dependent upon the residues 9, 43, 95, but not residue 156; (3) dependent upon residue 156, but not residues 9. 43, and 95; and (4) dependent upon residues 9, 43, 95, and residue 156. Further epitope mapping with the a-helix mutants demonstrated that a substitution at residue 152 often destroys an epitope not affected by substitution at residue 156. Even conservative substitutions at position 152 were more disruptive than nonconservative changes at residue 156. Residue 149, while important in defining an mAb epitope, had no effect on any CTL epitopes. These results indicate that spatially separate residues in the a-helix and 8-sheet of the molecule can contribute to the epitope recognized by a given CTL.

We investigated the role of TCR $cells in the immune response to Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). After immunizing mice with CFA, we observed a greater than 26-fold increase in the number of TCR $3 cells present in lymph nodes draining the sites of Immunization, compared to a 3-4-fold increase in the number of TCR ap cells. There were at least three different species of 3TCR's expressed on these cells in the draining lymph nodes, including two protein products derived from the rearrangements of Cyl and Cp, and one product derived from Cy4. 37% of TCR yS cells from immunized lymph nodes expressed the IL-2 receptor in vivo. and these cells constituted roughly 50% of the proliferative response of total lymph node T cells to 11-2. Tse, et al.

We have utilized their approach of analyzing the slope of log cell number-log response curves to examine whether TCR @ cells can function as \"recruitable\" cells.

The genes for T N F -a and TNF-p are tandemly arranged on mouse chromosome 17, with only 1.1 kb separating the 3' end of the TNF-p mRNA from the 5' end of the TNF-a mRNA. Yet, the two genes are independently regulated. In vitro transcription and nuclear run-on experiments indicate that the two genes are transcribed from independent promoters. In macrophages, which express TNF-a but not TNF-p, only the TNF-a promoter is active. In T lymphocytes, which can synthesize both proteins, both promoters are active. Activation of either cell type results in a moderate (up to 10-fold) increase in the level of transcription, while mRNA levels increase more than 1WfoId under the same conditions. Interestingly, the TNF-p gene is aanscribed 10-fold less than the TNF-a gene in T lymphocytes, although the corresponding mRNA is more abundant. These results indicate that the accumulation of both TNF-a and TNF-p mRNA after cell activation and their relative steady state levels are controlled mostly at a post-transcriptional step. Acanomycin D chase experiments reveal that TNF-a mRNA stability in macrophages is not significantly altered after activation by LF'S, and therefore that stabilization done cannot account for the observed accumulation of TNF-a mRNA. In order to examine more closely which elements are required for the regulation of TNF-a and TNF-P mRNA abundance, we constructed hybrid genes combining putative control regions of TNF-a and TNF-p with known constitutive control elements. Results obtained from the transfection of these hybrid genes into various cell types indicate that elements located both 5' and 3' of the coding sequence are required for the proper regulation of TNF-a and TNF-P mRNA abundance.

F.R.G. Recently we have shown that cloned L . major-specific L1/1 T-helper cells of type 2 (Th2cells), when stimulated with antigen, are able to induce polyclonal B-cell proliferation (1). We here present evidence demonstrating that this process is dependent on a direct cellcell interaction between T-and B-cells. which in the effector phase, i.e. during stimulation of the B-cells by activated T-cells, can be mediated by a mechanism other than cognate interaction. This conclusion is derived from experiments, in which highly purified resting B-cells were polyclonally stimulated by L1/1 T-cells triggered by an anti-T3 monoclonal antibody, in the absence of antigen. The triggering process was independent of the presence of the Fc part of the antibody and occurred in cultures devoid of macrophages. Thus, the well established cognate recognition does not appear to be the only way of B-cell induction by T-helper cells of type 2. Studies show that a proportion of the peripheral blood CD3' T lymphocytes do not express CD4 or CD8 and are called double negative T cells. They normally have a 1 6 TCR.

Expression of unrearranged TCR delta genes in CD3-cells provides further evidence that these cells belong to the T cell lineage. functional capabilities and by differential release of either IL2 or IL4 upon activation. We have produced a new monoclonal antibody to CD45 which has allowed us to separate normal murine CD4+ cells into two populations based on the density of expression of CD45 epitope. The separated populations seem to be analogous of subsets found in cloned T cell lines. CD4+ T cells with high density of cell surface CD45 after polyclonal activation produce IL2 and mRNA encoding IFW and IL2. It does not produce IL4 or IL4 mRNA. CD45 low density population on the other hand transcribes mRNA for IL4 and secretes IL4 protein. Data will be presented to demonstrate that the two subsets of normal CD4+ cells also differ in their proliferative response to mitogenic stimuli and to exogenously added growth factors. The substitution of V to L at 95 was the only change that could be discriminated by 2 of 9 allospecific CTL lines. suggesting that those 2 CTL lines recognize A2.1 plus a peptide whose presentation andlor binding is affected by the V to L substitution in the floor of the peptide binding site. In contrast, the L to W substitution at 156 (but not the other 2 substitutions) abolished the ability of the A2 molecule to present the viral peptide to 24 out of 25 peptide-specific A2.1-restricted CTL lines, suggesting that this substitution alters the presentation of the influenza matrix peptide but does not inhibit the ability of the peptide to bind to the A2 molecule. Although y8TCR.s have a great potential for diversity, it remains to be determined whether this potential is realized in terms of expressed y6TCRs. Preliminary studies in several laboratories have indicated that y6TCRs expressed in earlg t h r c y t e s and adult epithelial tissues are more restricted in diversity com ared to adult TC expressin thymocytes. We have derived a panel of cloned dendritic epigrmal T cells (JETC, lines and5ybridomas that express at least three types of y6 receptors -C 8, Cy26 and C N .

Our resu& indicate that for this panel of cloned cell lines 7 and ! irkg is nonrandom and that variability in certain types of receptors appears to be restricted. %owever, we have observed significant 6 chain diversity in these cells that is obtained by the use of multiple V-regions, and N-region and junctional diversity. We are investigating whether the observed y and 6 chain pairing, and pattern of 6 chain diversity are present in other $TCR bearing cells or whether they are only characteristic of DETC. Activation of CTL precursors from murine unprimed spleen cells with rIL-2 or rIL-4 results in distinct lytic spectra, depending on which lymphokine is present. We have used allo-stimulation in limiting dilution analysis with subsequent testing on an allo-specific target (A20) and an MHCdeficient, non-specific target (RlE). In the presence of rIL-4 exclusively allo-specific CTL are generated, while rIL-2 supports a proximately equal numbers of precursors that k~ll A20 and RIE targets. Dose response analysis of rIL-2-supported killing activity indicates that the lytic spectrum is independent of the amount of rIL-2 used, and therefore this IL-2 effect is intrinsic in its activity on unprimed spleen cells. Mixing experiments indicate that rIL-4 can partially override the effect of IL-2 on the generation of non-specific killer cells. Split well analysis and cold target inhibition experiments are in rogress to ascertain the actual proportion of specific killer cells which can be generated with rIL-2. be. are also testing the ability of cofactors, such as IL-1 and IL-6, to optimize the response of IL-4 generated CTL.

To extend out understanding of the repertoire of TCR 7 expression, we prepared a cDNA library from CD4-,CD8-adult BALB/c thymocytes and cloned and sequenced 15 TCRq genes from this cDNA library. We found that 2 clones were transcripts of the unrearranged C7, gene and that 3 clones terminated in the J7, region. Nine of the remaining clones were V71,2-J7 C7 genes and five of these were in frame. Only one clone corresponded to C71 and was V7 -Jy C7jofned'in frame. SDS-PAGE analysis of the 7-chain proteins from the surface of both BALB/c anZCdBL)6 adult CD4-,CD8-thymocytes did not detect the 32,000 MW Vy C7 protein, but did detect the 35,000 MW V7C7 protein. These results suggest that despite the abundanc$%f Pull-length, functionally joined, V7 C7 transchpts in the thymocyte subset, the protein product is not expressed on the cell surface as the prehfcted 32,000 MW 7 protein.

In particular, the frequency, tissue distribution and ontogeny of cells capable of secreting IL4 in vivo is not known. These studies have been hampered by the fact that freshly isolated T cells from unprimed animals failed to secrete detectable amounts of ILA and IL5 when stimulated in vitro by lectins or alloantigens, whereas IU is readily detectable in these same cultures. Data presented here indicate that freshly isolated T cells from unprimed animals can be induced to produce IL4 in a receptor-de endent, antigen-independent manner upon stimulation by anti-CD3 antibodies. Our results also stow that only CD4' and not CDST cells can be induced to secrete IL4 and that cross-linking of the receptor is required for o timal activity.

As an extension of these studies, we have examined IE specific, alloreactive hybridomas derived from IE non-expressing (Eab) cytochrome c non-responder mice to determine their usage of va and Vp genes. tion assay showed that fourteen utilized the same Val1 gene segment used by the majority of cytochrome c specific, IE restricted T cells and eight utilized a closely related Val1 gene that also is associated with this antigen response. element most commonly used by cytochrome c-specific T cells was not found among the alloreactive hybridomas tested, @ genes less frequently used in the cytochrome response were expressed by seven of the 22 alloreactive hybridomas whose Va segments were defined by RNase protection. determining recognition of IE molecules both in MHC-restricted, antigen specific immune responses and in alloreactive responses.

The IEd determinant was shown to be a presenting element by monoclonal antibody blocking and by use of L-cell-transfectants as AF'Cs to purified T cells and to T cell hybridomas. A series of overlapping synthetic peptides identified two minimal T-cell sites within the parent peptide: Mice expressing IA and IE responded to a fragment at the N-terminus of the parent peptide (site 1) while mice expressing only IA responded to a distinct but overlapping fragment at the C-terminus (site 2 ) . These minimal sites identified in vitro could be used to immunize mice in vivo in an MHC-restricted manner.

However, following subsequent & restimulations, the pIL-4 frequency of normal responders rises and begins to approach that of the tolerant responders, such that the two populations are indistinguishable based on pIL-4 frequencies following the third round of in vitro stimulation.

Six out of 12 CD4+ clones were able to lyse Daudi or P815 cells in the presence of anti-CD3 antibodies. The remaining 6 CD4+ Tcell clones tested did not acquire this cytotoxic capacity during a culture period of 20 weeks. In the absence of anti-CD3 mAb, no lytic activity against Daudi. P815 and K562 target cells was observed under normal culture conditions. These two types of CD4+ T cells showed high reactivity with anti-CDw29 (4B4) MAb and no reactivity with anti-CD45R (284) mAb. The CD4+ clones without anti-CD3 mediated cytotoxic activities (TH2) consistently showed a higher expression level of CD28 antigens. TH1 CD4+ clones did produce IL-2, IFNgamma and TNF-alpha.beta. whereas the TH2 T-cell clones produced minimal amounts of IL-2. IFN-gamma and TNP-alpha. beta in response to anti-CD3 mAb and PMA. Not all CD4+ clones did release IL-4, but there was no correlation with cytotoxic activity. Moreover, as compared to the TH1 CD4+ clones, TR2 CD4+ clones proliferated moderately in response to anti-CD3 mAb. However, anti-CD3 mAb induced proliferation of only the TH2 CD4+ T-cell clones was enhanced by anti-CD28 mAb. Both CD4+ subsets provided help for polyclonal B-cell activation with anti-CD3 mAb. Our data suggest that the human CD4+ subset, in analogy to the murine system, comprises two functionally distinct T-cell subpopulations. In the mouse, when la antigens are isolated immunochemically, the predominant species isolated are the isotypic matched pairs, AaAp and EaEp. However, when la ap dimer expression is studied using an L cell transfection model, it is found that the isotype-mismatched dimer ApdEa is readily expressed at the cell surface. These results suggest that differences in assembly andl or transport of different la pairs may be most readily visualized in a competitive environment where multiple distinct la chains are available. To investigate this possibility, the relative efficiency of inter-and intra-isotypic dimer formation and expression was evaluated using a sequential L cell transfection system. L cells already expressing an ap dimer on the cell surface (ApdEa or ApdAad) were supertransfected with a third la gene (Aad or Ea, respectively). Synthesis of this second a or p protein led to competition for the unique partner chain. Individual clones were scored for cell surface expression of the distinct dimers (e.g., ApdEa vs EpdEa or ApdAad vs ApdEa) using FACS analysis with chain specific monoclonal antibodies. In addition, each species of mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot hybridization using bcus specific probes. Our results indicate that in the H-2d haplotype. isotype-matched dimers are expressed with 3-4X the efficiency of isotype-mismatched dimers. This result suggests that, regardless of the cell type studied, If each of the four murine la genes is expressed at equivalent levels, intraisotypic dimers will be expressed to the virtual exclusion of the interisotypic dimers. However, if chain synthesis asymmetry occurs, the isotype mismatched pairs may be expressed at immunologically relevant levels.",

On this pathway CD3 must be expressed late or after the acquisition of CD4 and CD8. Cell cycle analysis shows the highest rates of cell division to be among the RSA+ IL-2R-Pgp-1-population which probably precedes the transition to CD4+CD8+ and TcR expression. Thus it seems unlikely that TcR/antigen interactions play a role in cellular events occurring among the double negative cells which lead on to mainstream T-cell development. Egr-l is a murine early growth factor inducible gene which encodes a protein with zinc fingers. Its expression was investigated in murine B-lymphocytes stimulated through their antigen receptor (sIg) with anti-recptor antibodies (anti-Ig) . Rapid (by 15 minutes) upregulatlon of Egr-l mRNA expression was observed at doses of anti-Ig sufficient to drive the majority of GO cells into cell cycle. Agonists and inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) showed that expression was coupled to the PKC component of receptor immunoglobulin transmembrane signalling. Interestingly, signalling through sIg on the murine B lymphoma WEHI-231 did not upregulate Egr-l expression even though similar signalling pathways are associated with this receptor in these cells. Southern analysis showed that Egr-l is not deleted or translocated in this cell line. Importantly, cell growth and proliferation of WEHI-231 is inhibited by anti-Ig stimulation suggesting a relationship for Egr-l expression and differential processing of receptor Ig signals. This notion is further supported by the finding that murine B lymphomas whose proliferation is not inhibited by anti-Ig showed receptor immunoglobulin coupled Egr-l expression.",

Published data show that encephalitogenic H-ZU murine T cell clones with specificity for the N-terminal eleven amino acid peptide of myelin basic protein display a restricted fine specificity when tested on substituted analogs of the native peptide. For example, substitution of alanine at certain positions in the peptide totally abolishes the response of each clone (Acha-Orbea et al.. 1988. Cell 54:263) . Recent experiments also have shown that the ability of some peptide analogs to bind to H-ZU I-A gene products does not always correlate with their ability to stimulate the T cell clones (see accompanying abstract by David C. Wraith and Hugh 0. McDevitt). This suggests that H-2U mice may lack a T cell repertoire capable of recognizing these peptides complexed to H-2U I-A gene products. To test this possibility, H-2U mice were immunized with a panel of peptide analogs, as well as the native peptide. The in vitro T cell proliferative response to each of the peptides then was measured. The results show that in vivo immunogenicity of the peptide analogs also does not strictly correlate with their capacity to stimulate the T cell clones. In this way, the polyclonal T cell repertotre of H-ZU mice for the myelin basic protein peptide analogs was examined, and could be compared with the I-A binding characteristics of the peptides. terms of antigen and MHC recognition. This response involves a limited repertoire of T cells which crossreact on species variants of the antigen. In addition, T cells specific for the antigen in association with syngeneic MHC can recognize antigen on similar allogeneic MHC molecules. The groupin of clones by functional phenotypes defined by these crossreactivities allowed us to corrcfate TCR gene usage with either antigen or MHC recognition. Some of the pigeon cytochrome c-specific clones within one functional phenotype use receptors that differ by as few as two amino acid residues. Other clones e y s s very different TCRs but exhibit similarities in antigen/MHC reco nition.

Each clone exhibited a unique pattern of res onse to the antigen analog panel, even clones with very similar receptors. Also, eacE residue in the antigenic region of the peptide was critical for interaction with at least one T cell receptor.

Treatment of early lymphocytes with PMA results in a rapid and reversible decline in steady-state TdT mRNA levels within six hours. This rapid decline can be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a protein kinase C inhibitor, implicating protein kinase C activation in the decline of TdT mRNA. Nuclear run-off studies demonstrate that TdT transcription is rapidly down-regulated within 45 minutes after PMA treatment, indicating that this regulation occurs mainly at the level of transcription. Furthermore, cycloheximide blocks the decline in TdT in RNA showing that new protein synthesis is required for transcriptional inactivation.

The only lymphokine that showed equal amounts of mRNA for both fresh and primed T cells was IL-2. A time course of fresh and primed T4+ cell lymphokine production was also analyzed. The primed cells produced a short burst of lymphokine mRNA that peaked between 7.5 and 13 hr after Con A stimulation and declined after 18 hr. The fresh T cells produced a longer burst of lymphokine mRNA that peaked 18-44 hr after stimulation. The IL-2 receptor @-2R) mRNA time course from activated primed cells showed different kinetics than lymphokine mRNA. This suggested that molecular regulation of the IL-2R might be different than lymphokine regulation. To further examine molecular regulation in the primed T cells polysome profiles were evaluated for lymphokines, L 2 R , and other cellular genes. The recently developed method of gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has proven to be particularly suited for the analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) genes. We adopted existing methods for the preparation of cytoplasmic RNA from as little as 1000 cells and used this material as template for first strand c-DNA synthesis. PCR amplification of this c-DNA, using V-and C-specific oligonucleotide primers yielded enough material to produce single-stranded DNA in a second PCR which could then be sequenced without cloning. In case of unknown V-usage, the PCR was employed for screening for V-beta elements by sequential reactions with different V-beta specific primers. We have used this method to reinvestigate the H-2b restricted cytotoxic T cell response to TNP in C57B116 mice. Beta chain sequences of 26 CTL clones obtained by direct cloning of immune spleen cells were compared to sequences of 11 clones obtained by cloning of individual short-term in vitro CTL lines. It was found that a) in vitro bulk-stimulations reduced the heterogeneity of the beta-chain responses to TNP, b) similarities between different TCR-beta-chains concentrated on the usage of certain Jb-elements ( Jb2.6, 2.5, 2.1 ) rather than V-region or NID-region sequences, and c) the majority of Jb2.6 containing beta-chains was associated with alpha-chains expressing V-segments of the Val 0 family. These Expression of genes which encode the T cell antigen receptor is cenval to the generation of the T cell repemire. Our labomtory has been investigating genes for both the alpha and beta chains of this receptor in inbred strains of Runus norvqicus (the laboratory rat), a species in which several autoimmune disease models have been developed. and which is used extensively in transplantation studies. Using genomic Southern blots and mouse probes specific for five different V a subfamilies, we have estimated the size of the V a repertoire in ten inbred strains of rat. Results show a significant increase in the size of one subfamily and suggest increases in two others in all ten strains. The rat V a l subfamily has about twice as many members as the mouse, while the Va2 and Vu5 subfamilies, depending upon the enzyme used, show a similiar duplication. The Va6 and Va9 subfamilies have a comparable number of members in both species. These data are most easily explained by a single duplication event in the rat invoking at least one and perhaps three subfamilies, but not encompassing the entire V a locus. This implies that the Val subfamily (perhaps together with Va2 and Va5 subfamilies) is regionally clustered and not interspersed with either the Va6 or Va9 subfamily.

I n order to simplify detection of peptide-MHC interactions we have investigated the use of photosensitive-crosslinkers. Two reagents have been successfully tested. A benzophenone derivative of peptide 1-16 from rat myelin basic protein (RMBP) was only effective after the introduction of a glycine spacer residue between peptide and crosslinker. An azido-nitro-benzoyl derivative of peptide 7.4, a heteroclitic analog of RMBP 1-11 (1). had a high affinity and bound specifically to the peptide binding site. The 7.4 photoaffinity probe has been used to test the binding properties of other analogues of RMBP 1-11 and is Currently being used to define (a) the kinetics, (b) pH and (c) temperature dependence of the binding event.

This T cell repertoire is composed of a set of clones each of which is specific for a given foreign antigen. Therefore the precursor frequency of T cells specific for any give foreign antigen is extremely low. However, two prominent exceptions to this general rule exist, and these are the T cells present at high precursor frequency which are specific for foreign HHC products or for the products of the minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) genes in the mouse. The present studies were undertaken in order to examine factors involved in T cell repertoire formation by assessing the relationship between T cell repertoire for conventional foreign antigens and for Mls products. studies indicate a striking degree of overlap between the set of T cells specific for pigeon cytochrome c and the set of T cells specific for MlsC gene products. demonstrate that the basis for this overlap lies in the predominant expression of one TCR Vp gene, VBS, by those T cells which recognize MlsC.",

In contrast to the pattern in lymph node cultures from immunised mice we found that when culturing spleen cells from unimmunised mice there was a T-cell response against collagen that was preferentially directed against autologus CII. Since we earlier have found that autologus CII may induce an immune response and also arthritis in DBN1 mice we conclude that there exist T-cells capable of reacting with autologus collagen and inducing an immune response as well as arthritis but that these cells are under regulation so that they not readily can be activated into proliferation but may be induced to perform certain effector functions. tested.

Hunter, and Jack Gorski, The Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 5 3 2 3 3 . HLA polymorphism plays a key role in antigen:MHC interaction. The polymorphism of the first domain encoding exon of the HLA-DR p chain has been studied by in vitro DNA amplification and use of sequence specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization (SSOPH) to detect polymorphic sequences. A 230 bp segment of genomic DNA was amplified and hybridized with synthetic oligonucleotide probes (12-19 bases) under conditions that detect single base pair mismatches. Identification of these mismatches can be used to predict micropolymorphism in the protein products, including single amino acid changes. Haplotype specific patterns of oligonucleotide probe hybridization were defined for a panel of homozygous typing cells. Analysis of family data demonstrated the expected inheritance patterns. Most known serological specificities are encoded by multiple allelic forms of DR p chains and SSOPH can identify these differences. This was exemplified by detection of unique SSOPH profiles for subtypes of DR4, DRw6 and DRw52 alleles. This procedure was also used for analysis of HLA-DR polymorphism in large numbers of heterozygous individuals, including an HLA-deficient SCID patient. The SSOPH data were correlated with serological specificities and will be useful for delineation of HLA restriction in alloand autoimmunity. Different cell membrane receptors have been shown to be involved in human T lymphocyte activation induced by either monoclonal antibodies or mitogenic lectins. These T cell surface molecules can be divided into two categories : a) the T cell antigen receptor (TcR) associated with the non-polymorphic CD3 antigen b) T cell differentiation molecules not linked to CD3/Ti such as CD2 (T11) and Tp44 (9.3). Monoclonal antibodies directed against these T cell surface structures triggered different T lymphocytes functions : mitogenesis, IL-2 receptor expression, IL-2 secretion. Our knowledge about early events involved in T cell membrane activation is not complete, especially involving the transduction mechanism mediated by GTP-binding proteins ; nevertheless, numerous authors have demonstrated that CD3/Ti complex triggering induces the activation of phospholipase C, leading to the phosphoinositide cascade associated with an increase of free cytoplasmic calcium ions.",

Since membrane oxidative metabolism has been shown to be related to the stimulation of the phospholipase A2, and to be the final consequence of a membrane NADPHoxidase : this could represent a previously undescribed pathway of T lymphocyte activation. High affinity monoclonal antibodies (MAb), specific for Staphylococcal nuclease (NASE), were produced and characterized. Competitive inhibition assays were conducted resulting in a series of complementation groups that define eight overlapping epitopes. It is estimated that these epitopes account for 70% or more of the accessible surface of NASE. Mutagenesis of the coding sequences for NASE was carried out to produce a series of variant molecules (each differing from wild-type. NASE and from each other by a single amino acid) that will enable mapping of NASE epitopes, determination of residues involved in antibody binding, and the contribution of various physical and chemical factors to affinity and fine specificity. Screening some of these mutants with the panel of MAb enabled us to map several nonoverlapping epitopes and further subdivided some of the MAb complementation groups. Oligonucleotide-directed mismatch mutagenesis has been done on codons encoding the original amino acid residue and other surface residues in its immediate vicinity. Determination of enzyme activity and structural analysis by CD spectropolarimetry of several of the mutant proteins suggests that any structural changes that may occur are local and not global.

Activation of T cell proliferation is believed to occur via the hydrolysis of inositol phos holipids, which, through the second messengers inositol-1,4,5-tris hosphate and diacylglycerof(DAG), promotes the elevation of intracellular calcium levels anjactivation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. The role of PKC in T cell activation was investigated by comparing the effects of stimulation by 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), and the DAG, oleoylacetyl glycerol (OAG), on a >99% pure population of T cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% autologous serum. Treatment with either TPA or OAG caused down-regulation of the T cell rece tor, a consequence of its hosphorylation, but only TPA, in syner leuiin 2 receptor (IL2-R), expression and, sgsequently, proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining with antisera specific for the PKC subspecies a, PI, PII and 7 shows that restin T cells express a, PI and pII PKC subspecies which are diffusely distributed throughout the Celt. After 20 minutes treatment with either OAG or TPA all three subspecies are redistributed to a focal area within the cell. The redistribution is transient in OAG stimulated cells, where the PKC distribution is similar to that in untreated cells after 1 hour of treatment. In TPA stimulated cells, however, the PKC redistribution is prolonged, becoming more marked until mitosis occurs after 48-72 hours of treatment. These results suggest that transient intracellular redistribution ofPKC causes phosphorylation and down-regulation of the T cell receptor, but that prolonged redistribution is required or T cell proliferation. Sm is a nucleoprotein complex associated with small RNA molecules in eukaryotic cells. The spontaneous generation of anti-Sm antibodies is specific for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and develops in 2 5 % of MRL mice. The response has been shown to be T-cell dependent in MRL/lpr mice. T-cells specific for Sm are found only in MRL (H-2k) mice and mice bearing H-2s and H-2f haplotypes (which do not develop anti-Sm antibodies). We are currently working to define the variable regions of the T-cell receptor genes used in the Sm response. A series of T cell hybridomas from MRL mice has been generated and are being screened for Sm positivity. A technique has been designed to amplify specific alpha and beta chain TcR genes using the polymerase chain reaction allowing for a more rapid sequence analysis. It is also our intention to locate the Sm specific epitopes of the T-cell hybridomas.",

T cell proliferative responses and sera antibody levels of myasthenic patients to several synthetic peptides representing different epitopes of the human AChR were examined. We detected significant differences in the humoral and cellular responses of MG patients compared to healthy controls to peptides of the human AChR alpha-subunit with sequences p195-212, p257-269 and ~310-327. Proliferative responses of lymphocytes from myasthenic patients to p195-212 and to p257-260 correlated significantly with HLA-DR5 and with HLA-DR3, respectively. In order t o investigate further the immune responsiveness to selected sequences of the human AChR, T cell lines and clones specific for peptides p195-212 and p259-271 were established from lymph nodes of C3H.SW mice. The recognition specificities of these lines were tested by examining crossreactivity to a series of shortened and/or extended peptides of the above sequences. Deletions of amino acids in positions 211 and 212 (211=P, 212=L) resulted in a decrease of the peptides' stimulatory activity on the ~195-212 specific T cell line, whereas deletion up to position 200 on the N-terminal end had no effect on the triggering potential of the peptides.

The role of guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) in the regulation of phosphorylation of the y subunit of the CD3 antigen has been examined. CD3 y chain phosphorylation in isolated T cell microsomes or permeablised T cells was stimulated by the G protein activator, guanosine 5'-0 thiotriphosphate (GTPyS), but other nucleotides such as CAMP or GDPBS were ineffective. dependent. These data are consistent with the involvement of a G protein in the signalling mechanisms that regulate the phosphorylation of the CD3 y chain. The regulatory effects of calcium and GTPyS were compared in normal peripheral blood derived T cells and Jurkat cells. There were differences regarding G protein regulation of CD3 y chain phosphorylation in normal T cell and Jurkat cells and current models explaining these differences will be described. Expression of the gamma-delta T cell receptor has been thought to first occur in a population of thymocytes shortly after their precursors populate the thymus between 11 and 13 days of gestation. In the course of our studies investigating the ontogeny of T cell receptor expression in the mouse embryo we have identified an extrathymic site of gammadelta expression in a population of cells present at distinct times of gestation. Evidence will be presented demonstrating two periods of activity of the murine gamma locus in the developing embryo. are colonizing the thymus from the liver and the gene segment useage detected is different to that first expressed in cells of the developing thymus. around the time of birth) involves the functional rearrangement and expression of a gamma gene segment corresponding to the initial functional rearrangements detected earlier in gestation in the thymus, which can occur independently of thymic influence. demonstrate a new site of gamma-delta receptor expression in the liver of newborn mice that can occur in the absence of any thymic influence. The primary (in vivo) response of CS7BL/6 animals to the class I antigen Qa-1 is a helper (TH) dependent event as indicated by the requirement for copriming with a distinct antigen capable of activating helper cells. In contrast, the secondary (in vitro) response to Qa-1 demonstrates no need for costimulation with the helper antigen. In attempts to more closely examine the helper requirements for activation of primed CTLp, we have observed that depletion of L3T4 cells from spleens of Qa-1 primed mice abrogates the in vitro generation of anti-Qa-1 effectors. The response is restored by the addition of concanavalin A induced supernatant (CAS) or by the addition of syngeneic but not Qa-1 allogeneic L3T4 cells. Indeed, even in the presence of CAS, L3T4 cells expressing the Qa-1 alloantigen specifically suppress the activation of anti-Qa-1 CTL in a manner reminiscent of that seen with Lyt-2 veto cells. Although the mechanism whereby L3T4 cells exert suppression is unclear, we have determined that CTLp are susceptible to veto only within approximately the first 48 hours of culture, after which they resist suppression. Results from further studies of the nature of suppression and the L3T4 veto cell will be presented.",

G e n e r a l P h y s The Ly-6 alloantigens represent a family of phosphatidylinositol anchored proteins that function as accessory molecules in the process of T lymphocyte activation. The expression of these alloantigens is often induced on T and B lymphocytes after activation by mitogens or antigens. Previous studies have shown that the induction of Ly-6 alloantigens in T cells is at least in part due to the action of IFN-a/B or IFN-7. In the present study, we have demonstrated that IFN-7 also induced Ly-6 molecules on B lymphocytes and bone marrow cells. Furthermore, we now show that TNF also participates in the induction of at least one of the Ly-6 proteins, Ly-6A/E. TNF was found to synergize with IFN-7 to induce Ly-6A/E expression in thymocytes, T lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells, but not B cells. For T lymphocytes, the synergistic induction of Ly-6A/E by TNF was restricted to cells from the Ly-6.1 haplotype whereas IFN-7 was sufficient to fully induce Ly-6A/E expression in cells from the Ly-6.2 haplotype. This result is consistent with the notion that there is more complex regulation of the Ly-6AfE molecules in T cells obtained from the Ly-6.1 haplotype. For T cells from BALB/c (Ly-6.1) mice, Ly-6A/E, but not Ly-CC, molecules were induced by IFN-7 and TNF. Furthermore, when compared to Ly-6A/E, the regulation of MHC class 1 molecules in these T cells by TNF was minimal. The induction of Ly-6AfE molecules on BALBfc T cells resulted in an enhanced capacity to activate these cells through the Ly-6 T cell activation pathway. One transformed T cell line, 5.1.2. was also identified whose Ly-6A /E molecules were synergistically induced by IFN-7 and TNF. Optimal expression of Ly-6A/E molecules on 5.1.2 cells required continuous culture of this cell line with these two cytokines and resulted in the detection of optimal levels of cytoplasmic Ly-6AfE mRNA by Northern blot analysis. This latter result suggests that IFN-7 and TNF regulate Ly-6A /E at the level of transcription and/or mRNA stabilization. ",

This activation system, that was shown to be independent of accessory cells, accessory-cell derived factors or LFA-1 mediated intercellular adhesion (1). allows one to study the requirements for T-cell proliferation and differentiation in a well defined manner. IL-2 and IFN-gamma but no IL-4 could be detected i n culture supernatants of coated anti-CD3 stimulated T cells.

In that regard, we have found that the 2 Kb of DNA u p s a u~n of YJa are actively transcribed ('T early a\" transcript, TEA) early during fetal development. The presence of the TEA transcript presumably reflects the opening of the TEA sequence prior to the TCR-6 deletional rearrangement. In order to better understand the mechanisms involved in the DNA accessibility model, we started to look for DNA-binding proteins which might play a putative role in the opening or blocking of the TEA sequence. By the technique of \"gel shift assay\" we found such a negative regulatory protein in the nuclear extract from a non-lymphoid cell. The binding activity appeared to be specific as it was competed out by an excess of unlabeled autologous DNA and not by an excess of irrelevant DNA.

As a means of characterizing the expanding population of abnormal cells as well as the phenotypically mature (L3T4+) cells that may be associated with them, I have generated a series of T cell hybridomas from the enlarged lymph nodes and spleen of m p r mice. In parallel, I have derived a series of control (non-lprflpr) hybridomas from MRulpr X Balb/c F1 animals (which show no sign of pathology), and a series from MRL, mice (which have a delayed onset of autoimmunity without lymphadenopathy). Very few hybridomas (20-30) were obtained in the non-lpr derived fusions. When I Con A stimulated the lymphocytes from non-lpr mice prior to fusion however, many more hybridomas were obtained(l20-220). This is in contrast to the fusion efficiency obtained from lprnpr mice which did not require in viuo lymphocyte stimulation to obtain a comparable number of hybrids. This result suggests that the M U p r lymphocytes are activated in situ. In addition, while less than 15% of the lymphoid mass is comprised of T helper (L3T4+) cells , over 50% of the hybrids are L3T4+. The fact that a dispropomonate number of T helper cells are rescued by fusion suggests that the cells activated in situ may be autoreactive T helper cells. Currently I am characterizing these T helper cells for their lymphokine production, T cell receptor gene usage and auto-specificity and will compare them to the hybridomas obtained from non-diseased animals.",

In mice carrying only the a chain consuuct, the transgene was expressed in the thymus as early as day 15 of fetal life, 1-2 days before endogenous a chain mRNA. The first detectable cell surface expression of a transgene was on 25% of day 15 fetal thymocytes. This vast increase in up-bearing cells in fetal thymus was due to pairing of transgenic a chains with endogenous p chains, of which a substantial number are. normally rearranged by day 15 of fetal liie. The balance between ap-expressing T cell supopulations was grossly disturbed in these mice, the most marked abnormality being an increase in the number of L3Tnyt-2-cells both in thymus and in peripheral lymphoid organs. It therefore appears that premature expression of surface ap T cell receptor may disturb T cell differentiation pathways by allowing T cells to leave the thymus without expressing L3T4 or Lyt-2. Mice carrying the p construct showed no increase in surface expression of T cell receptor in fetal life, since endogenous a chain rearrangement was limiting. In mice carrying either the a or p chain mansgenes, the number and surface phenotype of T cells expressing y& T cell receptors was unaffected in early fetal liie. suggesting that the a p and y5 T cell lineages diverge before thc rearrangement and expression of the appropriate subset of T cell receptor genes.",

We investigated its presence on PBL from 60 patients with auto-immune disorders of the thyroid.

The percentage of LFA1+ cells was significantly decreased in patients with Graves' disease, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

BIO.A mice were primed subcutaneously with syngeneic spleen cells that had been pulsed with high concentrations (100pM) of the peptide 81-104, a CNBr cleavage fragment of pigeon cytochrome E. The T cell response was assessed using a sensitive limiting dilution assay that measures lymphokine production with the CTL-L cell line. The precursor frequency of antigen-specific cells in the draining lymph nodes of mice primed with antigen-pulsed spleen (APS) was 1 in 4000, indistinguishable from the frequency of 1 in 3400 found in mice primed in the footpads with 10 nmol of 81-104 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (data are given as geometric means, n=5, S.E.M = x/t 1.7 and 1.3, respectively). Despite the apparent similarity in the T cell compartment of mice primed using these different regimens, antibody induction was strikingly different. Mice primed with 81-104 in CFA developed serum IgM and IgG responses against the peptide, with antibody detectable in an ELlSA assay at a 1 :3000 dilution. Mice primed with 81 -1 OWAPS, however, produced no detectable anti-peptide antibodies. Maximal T cell clonal expansion therefore appears to be possible in the absence of antigenspecific B cells. These data argue against the hypothesis that antigen-specific B cells play an obligate role in T cell proliferation in vivo.

Treatment with mAb C305 induces the association of the 35 and 39 kD peptides with TCR in J.CaM2 cells but not in J.CaM1. J.CaM1 modulates TCR normally in response to anti-TCR mAb treatment (1).

SLE is an autoimmune disorder associated with several different HLA class I1 antigens. We studied a large SLE patient population by sequencing of the PCR amplified first domain of the DQB and DQa chains and by sequence specific oligonucleotide probes to further define these associations. Shared DQB sequences at amino acid positions 26=1eu, 30=tyr, and 57fasp may predispose some individuals with HLA DR1,2,4, or 6 to develop SLE.

The experimental disease is considered a model for certain uveitic condiiions in man. We have recently shown that IRBPderived synthetic peptides can also induce EAU/EAP in Lewis rats. The present study compared two such peptides, \"R4\" (residues 1158-1 180) and \"R14\" (1 169-1 191). Peptide R14 was found to be immunodominant, shown by its being recognized by lymph node cells (LNC) or line cells sensitized against whole IRBP. In contrast, peptide R4 was not recognized by the whole IRBP-specific lymphocytes and is considered nondominant. In addition, LNC sensitized to R14, but not to R4, responded to intact IRBP. R14 was superior to R4 in producing EAU/EAP and cellular immunity (minimal doses: 0.06 vs 67 pg/rat). On the other hand, the two peptides were comparable in their capacity to stimulate presensitized lymphocytes. Moreover, LNC sensitized against R4 were similar to those sensitized against R14 in their capacity to adoptively transfer EAU/EAP to naive recipients. This study thus provides a unique system in which both immunodominant and nondominant peptides produce autoimmune disease and can be compared for their immunological features. The age-related diminution in immune responsiveness has been shown to result from increased regulatory mechanisms and not from a paucity of immunobgical recruitment (Aging: Immunology and Infectious Disease 1,47, 1988). We present evidence based on \"libraries\" of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) oMained from young and aged donors that there occurs with aging an increase in autoimmunity which is possibly the result of the accumulation of liielong \"original antigenic sins\". The resultant increased connectivity of the immune system is represented by MAbs obtained from aged donors which are multiply anti-self cross-reactive. Furthermore increased connectivii is supported by the evidence that anti-2.4,6-trinitrophenyl MAbs are AD8 positive, 2D3 positive as determined by i n h b i i n studies using MAbs anti-idiitypic reagents. Analysis of the VH and VK region genes utilized by these MAbs indicate a nonrandom gene usage. Life bng stochastic immunological events lead to a pattern of cross-reactiities and non-random usage of VH genes. These immnological events lead to the emergence of the patterns which are partially elucidated by the data presented. These patterns mimick those seen early in ontogeny, but indicate a possible convergence to an ever-increasing connectance of the idiitypic repertoire expression. In other words, life-long immunological experiences contribute to a down-regulation resulting in both paucity of Drimaw immune reswnses and an increase in autoimrmnity which are both the earmarks of immunity in aging.

Comparison of the expressed repertoire of Vp gene segments in this newborn thymocyle population with similar data previously generated from an adult peripheral T cell population reveals two Vg genes, Vp12 and Vpl5, whose expression is decreased in the periphery, possibly due to the effects of tolerance. Two additional Vp gene segments were expressed more frequently in the peripheral population than in the newborn thymus, Vp5 (4.5 times higher in the periphery) and Val0 (2 times higher). It is possible that these represent Ewo instances of positive selection of T cells which is determined primarily by the receptor's Vg gene segment. Va gene segments were expressed in only 15% of newborn thymocyte hybridomas (compared to 58% expressing Vp) and determination of Va rearrangement frequencies was complicated by the unexpectedly large number (67%) of hybrids expressing CS mRNA. Further examination revealed that several Va gene probes were actually detecting rearrangements to CS. The most notable of these was Va7, which accounted for approximately 34% of the expressed Va repertoire but was rearranged exclusively to CS.",

In a separate set of experiment8 it was observed that clone 13 could recopize Kblll-122 when presented by H-2 class I molecules.

Both autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies play an important role in the pathogenesis of type I 1 collagen (CII) induced arthritis in mice. We have earlier reported that only strains with H-2q , H-2w3, H-2w17 and H2-r were responders to autologous mouse CII and only these strains developed arthritis after immunization with autologous or heterologous CII. However, heterologous CII induced a more acute and severe disease and a more pronounced autoantibody response. This findings indicate that 1) the ability to mount an immune response against autologous CII is a prerequisite for the susceptibility to collagen arthritis and 2) that a crossreactive autoantibody response after immunization with heterologous CII may further enhance development of arthritis.",

The anti-CII antibodies recognized at least 5 different epitopes on the CII molecule and originated from many different Vh and V kappa gene families. Furthermore, none out of 6 investigated anti-CII hybridoma expressed CD5 RNA message. We therefore suggest that the primary anti-CII autoantibody response involves activation of memory B-cells. These memory B cells have most likely been earlier activated by CII autoreactive T cells. In these aspects the origin of the anti-CII autoantibody response is principally different from the origin of \"natural\" autoantibodies. T cell receptors (TCR) recognize antigen in association with self MHC molecules, usually following processing to smaller peptides. The T cell repertoire to an antigen, therefore, reflects not only the ability of a given MHC molecule to interact with antigen, but also the affects of initial repertoire selection by self MC. We have t#tn analyzing the TCR repertoire specific for beef insulin (61) in Balb/c mice (H-2 ), which are high responders to the antigy. These studies revealed that Vp.3 is dominantly used in the TCR's specific for BI/A and our preliminary data suggests that the VgB.3 chain may be involved in MHC restriction. We have now obtained several T cell hybridmas specific for BI from (Balb/cXA/J) F1, animals. A/J mice (H-2a) are low responders to BI while the F 1 m ce a e high responders. Most of the Balb/cXA/J hybridmas were restricted to the Hin the Balb/c hybridmas. Interestingly, the analysis of V gene usage demonstrated that Vg8.3 was not used in the Balb/cXA/J hydridonas. The relevance of these results to the development of the TCR repertoire in different mouse strains will be discussed. This work was supported by the MRC of Canada.

In several rodent species and strains, the emergence of specificity to a discrete immunodominant epitope of Guinea pig basic protein (GPBP) results from selection of cell lines with whole GPBP.

The cell line responded in vitro to the peptide COKKeSpOnding to the region 39-54 of GPBP but not to peptides corresponding to other regions of GPBP. This cell line is restricted by I-A but not I-E and transfers a DTH response to GPBP as well as EAE into naive recipients. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the in vitro immunodominant epitope specificity defines the specificity of GPBP-specific encephalitogenic T cells. The definition of a new encephalitogenic epitope in the ACI strain also suggests that the mechanism of EAE in rats depends on strain-specific extrisic properties of antigen recognition such as the MHC class I1 genotype or the composition of the T cell antigen-receptor repertoire.",

Based on this hypothesis, a computer program \"AMPHI\" was generated which may aid in prediction of Th epitopes. Within residues 1 to 55 of spermwhale myoglobin (SwMb), a Th epitope is known to exist but has not yet been found. As an approach to further test the hypothesis, this undetermined Th epitope was sought both by an unbiased test of ten evenly overlapping 15-residue peptides that span the region, and by computer analysis. Of the ten peptides, only one was able to stimulate two clones that are specific for the 1-55 region. This peptide gave remarkably high stimulation index. Analysis of this region by the computer program also predicted the site covered by this peptide (residues 2640) to be the most likely site for Th epitope..

The peptide was able to prime T cells of B1O.BR mice in vivo for in v i m response to the native SwMb as well as to the peptide fragment of residues 1-55.

Tolerance induced by spleen cells from Mlsa congenic mice in BALB/c mice is as \"potent\" as that induced by whole background incompatible DBA/2 spleen cells, indicating that incompatibility at the Ml s locus ( The Ly-6 alloantigens have been shown to participate in the process of T cell activation based on the ability of anti-Ly-6 monoclonal antibodies to induce IL-2 production and proliferation of T lymphocytes. In the present investigation, we have demonstrated that peripheral T lymphocytes from A strain mice exhibited abnormally low proliferative responses after stimulation through Ly-6A/E and Ly-6C molecules when compared to responses of T cells from numerous other mouse strains. The abnormal activation of the Ly-6 pathway of A strain T cells was not due to ineffective Fc receptor cross-linking of the anti-Ly-6 monoclonal antibodies, to inappropriate cellular expression of the Ly-6A/E alloantigen in A strain T cells, or to an active suppressive phenomenon. Identification of this defect provided an opportunity to compare T cell activation by the Ly-6 and TCR pathways. Interestingly, T lymphocytes from A strain mice proliferated normally when the cells were activated by monoclonal antibodies to Thy-I or the CD3/TCR complex suggesting that this defective activation was selective for the Ly-6 T cell activation pathway. Cell separation studies of T cells and accessory cells demonstrated that this defect was quantitative rather than qualitative and that it was complex, residing at both the T cell and accessory cell levels. These results suggest that activation of T lymphocytes via the Ly-6 molecule may involve unique signalling pathways and that activation via CD3/TCR can proceed normally in the absence of a fully functional Ly-6 pathway. The H-u)d transfected L cells were recognized by the CIL when they were infected with either influenza A virus or a vaccinia recombinant virus encoding the PB2. Thirty-five synthetic peptides derived from PB2, which had either an amphipathic suucture or contained a Rothbard' epitope, were tested for their ability to render uninfected targets susceptible to lysis by influenza specific effectors. Three epitopes were identified, each of which contained a Rothbard epitope.",

We have approached this question directly by isolating subsets of DP thymocytes from fetal or adult thymus and have shown that only a subset of DP cells ( 4 0 % of adult thymocytes) can generate donorderived thymocytes after i.t. injection into irradiated hosts. low-density DP cells are injected i.t., up to 20-40% donor-derived cells can be seen at 6 to 18 days after transfer. CD4' cells can constitute up to 30% of these donor-derived cells at day 10. In contrast, an equivalent i.t. transfer of dull Ly-l/CD5 (dLy-1). early precursor thymocytes would not generate CD4' cells until days 12-13 but would produce some CD8' cells by 18 days. Thus we have detected differentiation of CD4+ cells and not CD8' cells from adult DP cells. depleted host and recovered donor-derived thymocytes 8 to 10 days after i.t. transfer of dLy-1 cells, when most of the donor-derived cells are DP. When retransferred, these DP cells displayed a more rapid progression of thymic localization patterns than dLy-1 cells, but were unable to produce enough donor thymocytes to analyze subsets. Thus CD4' cells appear to differentiate via a very minor (low density) subset of DP thymocytes. may not be generated from these intermediate DP precursors but directly from dLy-1 cells. The intrathymic differentiation process by which bone marrow-derived progenitor cells develop into mature, immunocompetent T lynyhocytes remains poorly understood. The majority of all intrathymic lymphocytes are CD4 8 \"double positive\" cells that have no well-documented function in thymic differentiation, but have been proposed to be either a critical intermediate between CD4-8precursor cells and mature T cells, or, alternatively, a \"dead-end\" cell type. Furthermore, although signals mediated through the TcR complex are critical for T cell tolerance induction and repertoire selection, the functions of the CD4 and CO8 differentiation antigens expressed by the vast majority of thymocytes are unknown. In the present study we addressed the possibility that CD4 functions as a signalling molecule during T cell development. We engaged cell surface CD4 on murine thymocytes by in vivo injection of anti-CD4 mAb, and monitored the effects of that engagement on distinct thymocyte subsets. C D 4 ' 8 + cells respond to CD4 cross-linking by dramatically increasing their cell surface expression of CD3 and TcR, and decreasing their cell surface expression of CD4. In contrast, mature CD4'8-cells respond to CD4 engagement by decreasing their cell surface expression of both CD3 and CD4. These results provide clear evidence that CD4 engagement regulates CD3/TcR expression on developing thymocytes, and, most interestingly, results in increased TcR expression by CD4+8+ double positive thymocytes. Thus, CD4 engagement is a membrane event to which C D 4 ' 8 ' thymocytes respond significantly, indicating that CD4 may be a signalling molecule in T cell development and may promote T cell differentiation by inducing increased CD3/TcR cell surface expression on CD4+8+ thymocytes in vivo.",

In contrast, evidence from our laboratory suggests that triggering h a CDZ8 occurs through a PKC-independent route. In this study we used Mab to various T-cell membrane antigens to localize the activation defect in T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected men that we previously showed to have an intrinsic defect in their proliferative response to soluble anti-CD3 Nab. Compared to HIV-homosexual controls, the monocyte-dependent response of T cells from HIV+ men to soluble anti-CD3 and a mitogenic combination of anti-CDZ Mab was decreased as was the monocyte-independent resgpnse to immobilized low-dose anti-CD3. In T cells from both groups a normal rise in (Ca ) . was induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CDZ Mab. However, T cells from HIV-infected men respondad poorly to direct PKC activation by PMA in the presence of healthy donor monocytes, whereas control T cells responded vigorously. In contrast, induction of proliferation by anti-CD28 Mab was comparable in T cells from HIV+ and HIV-men. Our results indicate in HIV+ men a selective qualitative T-cell defect in activation routes that are dependent on PKC activation, whereas PKC-dependent alternative activation appears to be unaffected.

Blocking of this enzyme with the drug H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazinet leads to an increase in cellular proliferation of D10 cells activated with specific antigen or mitogen. n addition, an increase in the amount of IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA is seen under these conditions compared to the level observed in mitogen activated cells in the absence of H-7. This superinduction of IL-4 and IL-5 lymphokine mRNA is also detected in mitogen activated D10 cells that are depleted of PKC protein by pretreatment of the cells with phorbol esters. In contrast, mitogen activation of s lenic T cells measured by proliferation is blocked in the presence of H-7. These data indicate that JKC has a regulatory role in TH-2 cells by exerting a negative feedback on the events that occur after cell activation avoiding an uncontrolled response. This effect is opposite to that seen in a bulk T cell population that represents mainly TH-1 type cells. The mechanism of signal transmission is, therefore, distinct in the two types of CD4 + T cells.

A transient increase in the intracellular Cat+ ion concentration has been shown to occur rapidly following activation of T lymphocytes. This response i s a more immediate and direct indication of T cell activation than either production of Interleukins or proliferation. We examined Ca++ flux analysis using Indo-l and the FACS to measure ag-speclfic T cell activation and also to sort for an ag-specific T lymphocyte subpopulation. Human T cell clones were exposed to elther allostlmulatory 6 lymphoblastoid cells (which cause prOliferatiOn of the T cells) or nonstimulatory 6 lymphoblastoid cells. In both CD4+ and CD8+ clones, we observed an ag-specific Cat+ flux response similar t o an lonomycin positive control. We then attempted to enrich for antigen specific T cells from a mixed population. Two phenotypically different human T cell clones were mixed in equal amounts. After coculture of the cell mixture w i t h 6 lymphoblastoid cells shown to stimulate only one of the T cell clones, the cell mixture was sorted on the FACS based on specific Cat+ flux. A ten fold enrichment was observed for the ag-specific clone. This approach allows rapld observation of T cell activation and provides a means of sorting antlgen reactive T cells from a heterogeneous cell population. Previously attemps to characterize the function of beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2-m) have used anti-beta-2-m antibodies, to block the functional activity of the protein. We now demonstrate that human beta-2-m and the proteolytic derivates beta-2-m Lys58 and beta-2-m desLys58 added in nanomolar concentrations to allogeneic, PHA and Con-A stimulated mouse lymphocyte cultures modulate the response induced. Thus beta-2-m and especially beta-2m desLys58 when added day 0 and 1 augment the generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in MLC, problably due to stimulation of endogeneous lymphokine production in the culture. Both the Con-A and PHA induced response were modulated. In the presence of beta-2-m and its proteolytic derivates the proliferation was optimal at 48 hours, as opposed to the 24 hours optimum in the abscence of beta-2-m. These results strongly suggest an active role of beta-2-m or proteolytic derivates hereof in the T cell activation and generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A (1.2 fold) .

While animal models which spontaneously develop abundant anti-nucleolar antibodies have not yet been described, high titers of such antibodies may be induced by treating susceptible strains of mice with mercuric chloride. We have identified the nucleolar autoantigen against which the HgCI2-induced IgG autoantibodies from mice of strain B1O.S are directed. It is a protein of apparent molecular weight of 36 kDa and PI value of about 8.6 which is associated with the nucleolar snRNA U3, and by these criteria, is identical with a polypeptide called fibrillarin. It is striking that scleroderma patients spontaneously form autoantibodies against the same U3 RNP protein. The HgC12-induced murine and the scleroderma-specific human anti-U3 RNP autoantibodies were indistinguishable in their reactivities towards fibrillarin. They further resemble each other in so far as both recognize epitopes on the 36-kDa protein which have been highly conserved throughout evolution.

To identify genes induced by IL2, a cDNA library was made from IL2-stimulated cloned T cells in late G1 of the cell cycle and was screened by differential hybridization, selecting those clones which had higher steady-state mRNA levels after IL2 stimulation. Of 40,000 clones originally screened, 90 positive clones were identified, which represented 21 different genes. When partially sequenced and compared with sequences in the NIH and EMBL databases, 6 clones were identified as cDNAs encoding glycolytic enzymes, 4 were cDNAs of cytoskeletal genes, 3 were cDNAs coding for proteins important in protein synthesis, and 8 clones were not identified. The maximal steady state mRNA levels generally occurred during late Gl/early S phase, and the induction of most M A S was not inhibited by cycloheximide at a dose that inhibited cell proliferation. Nuclear run-on transcription demonstrated an increase in the rate of transcription for GAPDH. In addition, there is post-transcriptional regulation of expression, as some mRNAs were stabilized upon IL2 stimulation. Having cloned these mRNAs, we can now begin to study the regulation of expression of selected genes. Supported by NIH grants. Cyciosporin A (CsA). a potent immunosuppressive drug, caused organ-spedfic autoimmune disease, such as gastritis with anti-parietal cell autoantibodies or oophoritis with anti-oocyte autoanliies, in BALWc mice when the drug was administered daily for one week to newborns. Administration to adult mice did not. CsA abrogated the production of L3T4' T cells and Lyl-2' T cells in the thymus. Consequently, these T cells were substantially depleted from the peripheral lymphoid organs, especially when the drug was administered from the day of birth. Autoimmune disease was prevented when CsA-treated newborn mice were inoculated with splenic T cells from normal syngeneic mice. On the other hand, removal of the thymus immediately after neonatal CsA treatment produced autoimmune disease with a higher incidence and in a wider spectrum of organs, i.e.. thyroiditis, sialoadenitis of the salivary gland, gastritis. insulitis of the endocrine pancreas, adrenalitis, oophoritis, or orchitis. Each autoimmune disease was accompanied by the development of autoantibodies specific for the corresponding organ antigens. It is likely that CsA caused organ-specifc autoimmune disease, when administered to newborns, by depleting certain regulatory T cells (suppressor T cells) controlling self-reactive clones.

In transgenic H-2b mice, a large fraction of T cells in the periphery expressed the 2C TCR. These T cells were predominantly CD4-CD8+ and were able to specifically lyse target cells bearing Ld. In the periphery of transgenic mice expressing Ld, functional T cells bearing the 2C TCR were deleted. This elimination of autoreactive T cells appears to take place at or before the C04+CD8+ stage in thymocyte development. In addition, we report that in H-2s mice, a non-autoreactive target haplotype, large numbers of CD8' T cells bearing the 2C TCR were not found providing strong evidence for the positive selection o f the 2C TCR specificity by H-26 molecules. The requirements for CD4 expression during T cell differentiation in fetal thymus organ culture WOC) were investigated by analysis of the effects of addition of anti-CD4 Mab. Control ETOC cult& for 5 days contained predominantly CD4+CD8+ cells as well as CD4 or CD8 single positive cells expressing high levels of CD3. T cells from FTW cultured for 5 days in the presence of anti-CD4 M a b expressed markedly diminished CD4 expression. When anti-CD4 M a b was removed 20 hours prior to phenotypic analysis, it was found that CD4 was recxpressed on CD4+ CD8+ T cells. After 12 days of culture, control ROC contained high frequencies (23-3046) of CD4+CD8and CD4-CD8+ thymocytes expressing high levels of CD3. In contrast, anti-CD4 mated cultures, while containing CD4-CD8+, CD3+ T cells, were well depleted of cells which reacted with anti-CD4 antimy. When anti-CD4 Mab was removed 20 hrs prior to analysis, CD4 was reexpressed on CD4+CD8+ cells, and low frequencies (6%) of CD4+ CD8-T cells were detected, but these CD4 single-positive cells did not express high levels of CD3 or detectable ap heterodimrs. While normal frequencies of CD4-CD8+,CD3+ cells expressed Vg8 determinants, the a n t i -w mated cultures were relatively enriched in CD4-CD8+CD3and CD4-CD8-CD3-T cells compaml to control 12 day EOC. These data demonstrate that while CD8+CD3+ T cells can differentiate in the presence of anti-CD4 Mab, differentiation of CD4+CD3+ cells is inhibited and cell surface CD4 is down-modulated. CD4+CD8+ cells can develop in the presence of anti-CD4 M a b and do express T cell receptors. These results suggest that CD4 expression, while not required for development of CD3+CD4+CD8+ T cells, is necessary for differentiation of mature CD4+CD8-CD3+ T cells, and that the interaction of 0 4 with its ligand is critical for thymus selection of Class-II specific T cells.",

In order to determine if TcR expression was required for CD4 and CD8 expression, we analyzed thymi from the occasional scid mouse which possessed small numbers of TcR-bearing thymocytes. Interestingly, expression of CD4 or CD8 was detected only in those scid thymi that possessed TcR' thymocytes, although CD4 and CDB expression was not confined to those TcR-bearing cells. Further, the introduction of TcR' cells from Thy 1 congenic normal mice into TcR-scid mice consistently promoted the expression of CD4 and CDB (but not TcR) by scid thymocytes. Moreover, scid thymocytes from these chimeras possessed CD4+8+ cells, however no mature, single positive thymocytes of scid origin were detected. Together, these results suggest that TcR-bearing cells within the thymic milieu are required for the expression of CD4 and CD8 and for the differentiation into CD4+8+ cells. However, final maturation into mature single positive thymocytes requires that the thymocyte itself express TcR.

According to these criteria, several peptides were synthesized and tested in immunological assays in vitro and in vivo. Correlations between these results and the physico-chemical predictions will be shown. Simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in association with class I major histocompatibility antigens.We have identified four distinct antigenic sites on SV40 T antigen defined by H-2Db restricted CTL clones. We have therefore attempted to map these antigenic sites precisely by using overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to SV40 T antigen amino acids. The synthetic peptides of 15-20 amino acid length were incubated for five hours with 5lCr labelled-non-SV40 transformed H-2b cells in the presence of CTL clones specific for each of the four antigenic sites; and the released radioactivity was used as a measure of specific recognition of synthetic peptides by the CTL clones. The results demonstrated that the antigenic site I resides between amino acids 205-219; sites II and 111 between amino acids 220-233. Site 111 can be separated from site II as it was found to reside between amino acids 225-239. The antigenic site V was localized between amino acids 489-503. These results show that SV40 T antigen is the target protein for CTL and the regions of T antigen recognized by CTL are tightly clustered in the amino terminal half. Attempts to identify amino acids that selectively interact with the class I antigen and the T cell receptor are in progress. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of cancer patients demonstrate an early humoral and specific response to application of tumoral extracts. The response is measured as a change in the spectrum of fluorescence polarization of fluorescein molecules. This is probably a measure of sol-gel transformations induced in the cytoplasm upon cellular activation of resting lymphocytes. This measurement is carried by epifluorescent microscopy on single lymphocytes, sitted on a regular holes matrix that is scanned under computer control.",

In hopes of working backward in the cascade which links the membrane events to the genes essential for these differentiated functions, we have begun an analysis of the nuclear proteins responsible for gene activation in stimulated T cells. In previous studies, using a panel of internal deletion mutations of the 1L-2 enhancer, we found that when the region from -13 to -82 was mutated, the level of induction dropped 20-fold. This region is protected in a DNAase footprinting assay by a protein, NF-ILZ-A. Although the protection is seen with nuclear extracts from both stimulated and resting Jurkat cells, in vivo this is a site of DNAase hypersensitivity found only in activated Jurkats and peripheral blood T cells. A tetramer of the protected site directs transcription from an unrelated promoter in Jurkat cells only when the cells are stimulated by lectin or antibodies to the antigen receptor. Furthermore this activation can be blocked by 1 ng/ml of cyclosporin A. As a means of detecting more subtle changes in protein binding following stimulation. the methylation-interference patterns of stimulated and non-stimulated Jurkat cell nuclear extracts were compared and found to be identical. We propose that though the DNA-binding protein, NF-IL2-A, is present constitutively, it becomes functional only following specific signalling through the antigen receptor. Further characterization of this protein will help to clarify its particular role in the activation of IL-2 expression following T-cell stimulation.

Immunology of the Univ. of Amsterdam, The Netherlands The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-diphosphate and the formation of inositol-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG) re among the first events that can be monitored after T-cell triggering. IP3 mobilizes C a 2 ' from intracellular stores, whereas DG is the physiological activator of Protein Kinase C (PKC). Although it is suggested that activation of PKC is essential in the induction of mitogenic T-cell responses, no direct evidence for this hypothesis has been presented yet. In this study we used two novel PKC inhibitors, 1.e. 1-alkyl 2 methyl-glycerol (AMG) and staurosporine to assess the role of PKC activation in human T-cell stimulation. We observed that the inhibl$ors did not interfere with the anti-CD3 or anti-CDZ monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced Ca rises in peripheral blood T cells, whereas cytoplasmatic alkalinization initiated by the same stimuli or the phorbol ester PMA was strongly reduced. AMG as well as staurosporine gave a dose dependent inhibition of both Interleukin 2 (IL-2) production in Jurkat cells and T-cell proliferation. In contrast, the induction of IL-2 receptor expression was highly resistent to the action of both compounds. It was shown that anti-CD28 Mab were able to partly overcome the action of both inhibitors. These studies support the important role of PKC-activation in human T-cell triggering. Moreover, since anti-CD28 mAb were able to counteract the action of the PKC-inhibitors, it is suggested that mitogenic stimuli generated via different T-cell membrane molecules may use distinct intracellular signal transduction pathways.

NDla4 We have developed a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an apparently T cell-specific antigen, LTac, expressed only in the late stages of T cell activation. When peripheral blood lymphocytes are activated with allogeneic stimulators or PHA and examined by FACS, LTac is expressed only after day 6 or 7. LTac is expressed by all T cell clones tested, both CD4' and CD8'. A wide range of cell types were tested and found negative for LTac expression, including B cells, fibroblasts, endothelium, and neural cells; thus LTac expression seems to be restricted to the T cell lineage. Immunoprecipitation of cell-surface labelled proteins and SDS-PAGE revealed a 160 kD band under reducing conditions and three bands of 240, 180, and 160 kD under non-reducing conditions. LTac is distinct from all other reported T cell activation antigens on the basis of its pattern of expression and molecular weight. We have purified LTac protein using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose chromatography followed by monoclonal antibody-agarose chromatography, and have used it to produce an antiserum suitable for screening bacterial cDNA expression libraries. The regulation and function of molecules expressed in the late stages of T cell activation is an important frontier in understanding the immune system, and reagents such as monoclonal antibodies may have important diagnostic and therapeutic uses. BALB.H.p7 mice were capable of responding to all 24 antigens tested but the magnitude of the response to some of these antigens (1 1 of 24 antigens) was reduced 2-5 fold when compared with BALB/c mice. Responses to the remaining antigens were either comparable (11 of 24 antigens) or occasionally even enhanced (2 of 24 antigens) compared to BALWc mice. These results suggest that Jp2 and Dg2 elements are required to maintain the strength of the T cell repertoire and that, in the wild, mice carrying this deletion a u l d be at a significant selective disadvantage. The identification of 11-1 was carried out in radiolabeled murine macrophages by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, using antibodies to were predominately of Mr 31.000 and 37.000, respectively. A s assessed by estimating radioactivity in each band, 11-larwas about 4 fold more abundant than 11-16. Most of the cell associated 11-1 activity, as measured by the D10.G4.1 proliferation assay, could be inhibited by anti 11-Iswhereas no inhibitory effect was observed with anti 11-1B. After removal of 11-ltc from cell lysates by immunoadsorbtion the residual activity accounted for only about 5 % of the total 11-1 activity, and was completely neutralized by anti 11-1B. However, in culture supernatants anti I1-1R reduced the 11-1 activity by approx. 50 % whereas a combination of both, anti 11-leand anti 11-10 completely neutralized the activity to background levels. Interestingly, only one radiolabeld polypeptide of M, 37.000 was precipated from the extracellular medium by the anti 11-16 antibody. These data therefore suggest, that externalization is required in order to generate bioactive 11-18 molecules, but apparently a proteolytic processing step of the precursor is not involved. Moreover, in view of previous reports, demonstrating that cellular interactions during antigen presentation can be mediated via a membrane form of 11-1, o u r experiments substantiate the hypothesis that membrane-associated, biologically active 11-1 is predominantely I1-1Q.",

All 18 clones produced gamma interferon in response to SPA stimulation. One of the clones demonstrated significant proliferative responses to a fragment of the SPA produced in E. coli infected with a recombinant lamda gt 11 phage containing a 1 kb fragment of the SPA gene from R.. We conclude that the SPA's from typhus group rickettsiae can elicit both a diverse T cell response in humans as well as the efficient stimulation of gamma interferon-mediated immunity. A monoclonal anti-mouse RBC antibody (G-8) has been prepared which appears to represent a pathogenic autoantibody related to those that arise spontaneously in aging NZB mice and which cause autoimmune hemolytic disease (AIHD). This autoantibody recognizes native erythrocytes from mice but not from other species, and Northern blot analysis revealed strong hybridization with the J558 probe but not with the 5 other Vh gene family probes tested. Thus, G-8 is clearly distinct from autoantibodies that recognize bromelain-treated MRBCs and which belong to a unique Vh gene family. When G-8-producing hybridoma cells were grown as tumors in BALB/c mice, the mice developed AIHD characterized by a decrease in the number of erythrocytes (hematwrit) and the development of Coombs-positivity. An anti-idiotypic antibody (E8) was prepared against G-8 and was found to recognize an idiotypic determinant present on most autoantibody forming cells derived from old (Coombs-positive) NZB mice. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of spleen cells from young NZB mice with G-8 + C or with anti-Ly2 antibody + C resulted in the elimination of suppressor cells and the generation of AFC specific for MRBC. Treatment with a control NZB IgM mAb (G-4) + C or with a rabbit anti-MRBC antiserum + C had no effect on the AFC response to MRBC. Similar deletion of suppressor cells was obtained following treatment of spleen cells from BALB/c mice with G-8 + C. Greater than 80% of the resulting AFC expressed the G-8 idiotype. The results indicate that the response to self-erythrocytes is comprised of autoantibodies that express a recurrent idiotype. In an attempt to determine the optimal molecular parameters for the synthesis of anti-pathogen vaccines, we have studied the murine antibody responses to two types of model vaccines. The vaccines were: (1) Purified polysaccharide Type 3 derived from pneumococcal bacteria, and (2) Synthetic conjugates made from a peptide region of the circumsporozoite coat protein of the murine malaria pathogen, P. berghei, coupled with dextran of high molecular weight. In both cases the molecular size was systematically vaned, and an optimal size was found to be important in determining the level of immune responsiveness. In the case of the malaria peptide-dextran conjugate, epitope multiplicity (epitope density) was also found to be an extremely important parameter, immunogenicity increasing with increasing epitope density.",

Accessory cell depleted resting (la) T cells are not able to produce autocrine growth factors when stimulated via the T cell receptor complex (TCR), although IL-2 receptor expression takes place. The addition of accessory cells restores the proliferative capacity. We have tested a series of recombinant lymphokines and growth factors for their ability to substitute this accessory cell function for human CDB and CD4 T cells. Triggering via the TCR was achieved by a combinatorial stimulation with anti-CD3 and either anti-CD4 o r anti-CD8 that gives rise to IL-2 receptor expression only on the corresponding T cell subpopulation. LL-3, TNFa, IF+, IL-1, IL-4, LL-6 and GM-CSF were either negative or induced only a minor proliferative response. However, the combination of IL-1 with IL-6 was nearly as efficient as IL-2 in CD4 T cells. CD8 T cells were much less stimulated by IL-1+ IL-6. effect, which is in contrast to some reports on accessory-cell depleted mouse T cells whose function require costimulation with IL-1. This observation might be important for the understanding of T cell proliferation in chronic inflammatory tissues in which IL-1 as well as IL-6 is produced in large amounts. Structural and serological studies of these secreted effector molecules have suggested that they are disulfide-linked dimers bearing T cell receptor u and 6 chain d terminants. A T cell hybridoma, MTs 79.1, constitutively Antibody staining indicated MTs 79.1 expresses a T cell receptor containing a Vg8 element. Northern and Southern analyses indicated MTs 79.1 used V68 and Va4 genes to encode the T cell receptor. The secreted MTs 79.1 suppressor molecule was bound by monoclonal anti-V68 antibodies and by antibodies specific for constant region determinants of the u chain. To assess the role of a and 6 chain genes in encoding the secreted suppressor molecule, we have generated V68-and Vu4-negative variants from the MTs 79.1 parent. Experiments performed to date indicate that the loss of the V68 gene results in the inability to produce the suppressor molecule. The results are consistent with the idea that the T cell receptor u and 6 chain genes are used to encode these hapten-specif ic/MHC-restricted secreted suppressor molecules. producing a DNP-specific/H-ZK 5 -restricted suppressor molecule was generated and studied.

Protective immunity to the ultraviolet (W) light-induced sarcoma 1591-RE is directed toward a single tumor-specific transplantation antigen expressed by the 1591-RE tumor cells. termed the A antigen. A progressive variant line of 1591-RE, termed 1591-PRO4, lacks only the expression of this A antigen. Immunization of mice with 1591-RE tumor cells haptenated with trinitrophenyl (TNP-1591-RE) leads to the subsequent rejection of TNP-haptenated progressive tumors and to increased delayed-type hypersensitivity and CTL responses to TNP in normal, immunocompetent syngeneic mice. However, little or no humoral immunity to TNP is seen in animals injected with TNP-1591-RE tumor cells. PRO4 did not exhibit TNP-specific tumor protective or cell-mediated immunity, but rather exhibited tolerance to subsequent immunizations with more immunogenic forms of TNP. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have revealed the A antigen to exist on the cell surface as a complex of 3 class I MHC-like molecules. Transfection studies with DNA encoding each of these molecules into 1591-PRO4 reveals that the expression of one, and only one, of these three molecules mediates this increased immunity. These experiments suggest that an MHC-like antigen expressed on the 1591-RE sarcoma acts as a natural adjuvant to increase cellmediated but not humoral immunity to linked antigens. The mechanism of this increased immunity is discussed. Efforts to immunize cattle against economically important gastrointestinal nematodes showed that inrmunity is manifested by: 1) a response that reduces the fecundity of established and subsequently acquired worms. and/or 2 ) a reduction in the number of worms developing upon challenge infection. However. the ability of individuals to mount such immunity is highly variable. Extending these studies to naturally infected populations indicate that there is a great difference in the number of eggs excreted by individual young calves on pasture. To delineate whether these differences were the result of host genetics and to begin to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to parasite infection, a genetically defined cattle herd was assessed for parasite levels by determining fecal eggs per gram. Three years of sampling of the calves during their first grazing season indicates that: 1) certain individuals in the herd will consistently excrete high or l o w numbers of parasite eggs, 2 ) the high or low phenotype is significantly controlled by the genetic make-up of the calf, and 3 ) the high or low phenotype is highly heritable (heritability -40).",

Webelievethattheuseof this peptide-phospholipid canplex tehmlogy will be significant both for studying the innwE response to single epitcpes and for vaccine develolment. Based on assays in which T cell proliferation was induced via oxidative mitogenesis and exposure to MHC alloantigens, it has been reported that Langerhans cells (LC) isolated from normal mouse skin aquire maximum capacity to activate T cells only after 72 hours of culture. We have studied LC from BALB/c mouse skins for their capacity to present ovalbumin (OVA) and Ia doantigens to unprimed T cells and to antigen-specific T cell hybridomas. The data reveal that both fresh and cultured LC presented OVA and alloantigens with equal efficiency to previously primed responders (and with 10 fold greater efficiency than spleen cells or the B cell lymphoma A20.1-11). By contrast g& cultured LC displayed the capacity to present antigen to ynorimed T cells. We propose that the antigen presenting potential of freshly prepared and cultured Langerhans cells, respectively, reflect the in vivo functional properties of intraepidermal LC and of LC that have picked-up antigen in the epidermis and migrated via dermis to the regional lymph node. If so, these data suggest that resident epidermal LC are fully prepared to present cutaneous antigens to memory/effector T cells (efferent limb), whereas resident LC must leave the influence of the epidermis in order to develop the capacity to meet the more stringent conditions required for antigen presentation to porimed T cells (afferent limb). We have investigated the structural restrictions placed on residues contained within a minimal T cell determinant, using the Balb/c class I1 restricted T cell response to the site 1 determinant of the influenza hemagglutinin molecule as a model system. To delineate which of the residues comprising the site 1 determinant are involved in interaction with the T cell receptor, we have determinaed the response of a large panel of site 1 specific T cell hybridomas to a collection of peptide analogs differing by single conservative or non-conservative substitutions at 9 positions. The fine specificity patterns of the T cell panel is extremely diverse; T cells varied in both the location and number of residues within the antigenic peptide that effected recognition. Our results implicate at least 6 out of 9 residues within the antigenic pepetide as being involved in interaction with the T cell receptor. This result suggest that peptides comprising the site 1 determinant do not form alpha helical structures when in association with MHC molecules. Rubella-specific isotype and IgG subclass responses were evaluated using ELISA techniques in 44 rubella HA1 seronegative adult females undergoing rubella immunization (RA 27/3 strain).

Post-immunization, I 1 subjects failed to develop IgM class responses by the HA1 (SDG) technique while 43/44 developed IgM antibody by ELISA techniques.

We and others have demonstrated that the cellular immune response to HSV-1 contributes to the elimination of virus from the cornea, but in doing so causes the tissue destruction that is responsible for the blinding complications of the disease. We have demonstrated that specifically suppressing the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HSV-1 renders mice resistant to corneal disease following topical corneal HSV-1 infection. In agreement with this observation was our recent finding that in vivo depletion of WT4' (T helper/inducer, and most DTH effector cells) neither reduced susceptibility to corneal disease, nor increased susceptibility to disseminated disease. The corneal lesions in WT4 depleted mice contained numerous Lyt-2 (T suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, and no L3T4 cells. The WT4 depleted mice exhibited normal HSV-specific CTL precursor frequencies.",

Mikko Hurme, Tessa Palkama and Marja Sihvola, Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, SF-00290, Helsinki, Finland. IL-I production of human monocytehnacrophages is regulated by several cytokines some of which are themselves able to activate the IL-1 production (e.g. TNF and IL-2) while others (e.g. IFN-y) modulate the production activated by other signals. We have now examined the effect of 11-4 on the 11-1 synthesis. 11-4 alone did not induce any 11-1 bioactivity or IL-la or 11-1 0 mRNA expression in freshly isolated peripheral blood adherent cells. In contrast, IL-4 effectively suppressed the LPS induced 11-1 production. This suppression took place without any decrease in the steady-state levels of IL-la and IL-I 0 mRNA, suggesting that this downregulative effects is posttranscriptional. Monocytehnacrophages are known to rapidly loose their ability to produce IL-I when cultivated in vitro. If IFN-yis present in the culture fluid, the cells remain capable of producing 11-1. As IFN-yand have been reported to have similar \"priming\" effects on macrophages (e.g. increasing the tumoricidal capacity and MHC class II antigen expression) we cultivated monocytes for 24 h in the presence of either IFN-y or 11-4, and after washing the cells they were stimulated with LPS. IL-1 activity could be detected both in the IFNyand IL-4 preincubated cultures (but not in the cultures preincubated with medium alone). These data suggest that IL-4 can also display a similar upregulatory function in IL-I production as IFN-y.

T-cells from immune animals and humans were responded in culture to a recombinant 155 kDa antigen.

In contrast. a strong cross-reactive T-cell proliferative response is produced. Studies are in progress to determine the nature of the common protective antigen of R. Humans infected with the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides vary considerably in antibody responsiveness to a 14 kDa component of the parasite. This molecule is secreted by the parasite, and is also abundant internally. This heterogeneous reactivity has been modelled in laboratory rodents, and the antibody response to it is H-2-and RT1-restricted in mice and rats, respectively. Using inbred and congenic animals, only mice of H-2' and rats of RTIU were, so far, found to be responders, and this restriction only operated in the context of infection. The specificity of the IgE response in these animals was assayed by Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis, and in an IgE-specific ELISA assay. The data show that the above Mhc restriction also applied to the specificity of the reaginic antibody response, although animals of all Mhc haplotypes responded to other Ascaris allergens. Amino acid analysis of the 14 kDa equates it to a previously identified \"Allergen A\" of the parasite, and we now have its sequence available. These findings have implications for the genetic control of allergic responses in general, and, in particular, to the hypersensitivity responses which are such a feature of infections with parasitic nematodes. There are also implications for the generation of hypersensitivity responses by recombinant vaccines involving certain parasite antigens. the CNS. Immunohistochemial analysis of both frozen sections prepared from the brains of animals immunized in this manner and of highly enriched glial cell subpopulation cultures for viral gp70 expression indicated that oligodndrocytes and possibly a subset of astrocytes were the targets of this infection. Further, microscopic analysis of frozen sections failed to reveal any overt signs of gross pathologic changes associated with the viral infection. We have been able to demonstrate the presence of virus specific antibody in the serum of these mice as well as virus specific cytolytic T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. ments are currently underway to determine whether the lack of pathology associated with WB91 infection in light of the previously shown virus specific immune responses in these mice is due to a failure of antigen presentation within the CNS or some other form of immunoregulatory phenomena.

Sera from B6 mice immunized with a syngeneic CTL specific for FBL-3 tumor of B6 origin blocked the cytotoxic activity of only the immunizing CTL clone. Therefore, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) N9-127 was produced by fusion of the B6 spleen cells immune to a syngeneic FBL-3-specific CTL clone (No. 8). The specificity of the mAb N9-127 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, blocking of cytolytic activity, stimulation of proliferation, and induction of TCR-mediated nonspecific cytolysis of the CTL clone No. 8. In some B6 mice, 3-13% of the anti-FBL-3 MLTC cells were positive for this N9-127-defined idiotype, and formed a well demarcated population upon examination by flow cytomehy. Even in mice in which no such population was observed some CTL clones established by limiting dilution culture were also positive for this idiotype (10 out of 89 clones from 3 mice). The cytotoxic activities of these CTL clones were blocked by N9-127, which in turn induced the nonspecific cytolysis in redirected assay. However, no positive cells were detected in non-cultured normal or FBG3-immune spleen and lymph node cells. This indicates the presence of cross-reactive (dominant) idiotype in the B6 anti-FBL-3 cytotoxic T cell responses and may provide a potent tool for analyzing the idiotype-mediated regulation of the anti-tumor immune responses.

The length the epitopes varied from 4 to at least 20 amino acid residues. We present evidence that the larger epitopes, although conformation-independent according to operational criteria, are nevertheless discontinuous. 3 . In IBV, we localized several overlapping but different epitopes within an immunodominant region of 30 residues. This region is recognized by all polyclonal antisera tested. We propose that its immunodominancy is a consequence of its structure and function and does not depend on antigen presentation or idiotypic networks.",

Sporozoite-immune spleen cells, CD4+ and CD8+ enriched T cell populations of Balb/c (H-M), C3H @I-%), and C57BV6 (H-2b) mouse strains were cultured in the presence of irradiated sporozoites or synthetic peptides representing 70% of the complete CS protein. Surprisingly, none of the cultures proliferated to any of the peptides tested, although proliferative responses to sporozoites were observed in unfractionated spleens and CD4+ T cell populations. CD8+ T cells did not respond to any of the antigens tested, even in the presence of exogenously added 11-2. Titration of CD8+ cells into proliferating CD4+ cell cultures did not suppress the anti-sporozoite response. The lack of anti-peptide reactivity contrasts with uniform responses to sporozoites and may be the result of the context in which CS antigens are presented to T cells. Functional analysis of accessory splenic B cells and macrophages revealed that while the anti-sporozoite proliferative responses were not affected by the removal of macrophages, sporozoite-primed B cells were essential for the responses. These data suggest that the CS protein on sporozoites is not processed extensively by macrophages to yield many potential T cell epitopes, but instead is presented by immuncdominant B cells that resmct responses to a limited number of T cell clones. of the primary infection and is also required for optimum protection against reinfection. Current studies have demonstrated that relatively few of the viral antigens tested to date ( 7 viral envelope glycoproteins or 2 nonsmctural nuclear proteins) are recognized by HSV-1 immune CTL populations generated in several different strains of mice (H2 haplotypes H2b, H2d. or H2k). This failure of HSV specific CIZ to recognize the cloned gene products in in v i m assays was demonstrable at the clonal level and could not be attributed to a peculiarity of the recombinant vaccinia conshucts used because studies with adenovims vectors or tranfected L cell constucts yielded the same results. Surprisingly, despite their inability to be recognized by HSV specific CIZ in vim, when used to immunize mice several of the vaccinia virus constructs would induce memory CIZ populations capable of lysing HSV-1 infected autologous cells. For example, HSV-1 glycoprotein C (gC) was recognized by H2b restricted but not H2k restricted HSV specific CTL. However, immunization of either haplotype of mice with a vaccinia gC recombinant induced CTL populations which upon in v i m restimulation with HSV-1 would lyse histocompatible cells infected with HSV-1. This demonstrates that despite the presence of suitable epitopes (intrinsic factors) the context of the immunogen (extrinsic factors) will also influence it's ability to induce CTL. The results of further studies into the nature of these extrinsic factors will be presented and discussed with relevance to future sub-unit vaccine design. w d ~upponrd by public ~~l t h Service G~MU, AI 14981 md AI 24471 fran the ti-^ ~n,litu= md lnrcniour D ,~~~~~~.",

Additionally, inoculation of adult mice with a biological clone expressing the GV phenotype also results in similar variant viruses.

The 19K glycoprotein encoded in the E3 region of Ad2 and Ad5 (gpl9K) binds to class I MHC antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents their translocation to the cell surface. This has been proposed as a mechanism by which virus infected cells can avoid recognition by the host cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. We have shown that gpl9K can inhibit target cell lysis by adenovirus specific CTL, but the effectiveness of this inhibition varies greatly between different mouse strains. This is due in part to differences in the affinity of gpl9K for different MHC class I molecules, but this cannot account for a l l the variation observed. I t has been shown that CD4+8+ immature thymocytes fail to secrete IL-2 or express IL-2 receptors in response to activation signals. Furthermore. they cannot induce IL-2 gene transcription.

Thus, the specific T cell response against a mH antigen can occur in the presence of chronic GVHD despite the absence of a polyclonal B and T cell response Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a member of the arenavirus family, has a biseqmented RNA genome which encodes at least three polypeptides. The smaller RNA segment encodes two virus structural proteins, the slycoprotein (GP) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Upon infection of mice with LCMV a cytotoxic T cell immune response directed against these proteins is measurable in vitro and in vivo. It can be demonstrated that depending on the haplotype of the mice, one or the other protein may play a major part in the immune response. In order to define the immunogenic epitope(s) of the nucleoprotein which are recognized specifically by the T cell receptors of cytotoxic T cells, stepwise 3 ' truncated qene fraaments encodina the nucleoprotein were cloned and expressed in vaccinia virus. With these recombinant vaccinia viruses, protection experiments in mice aqainst LCMV infection were performed in parallel with in vitro studies, namely specific recoonition of target cells expressing truncated fragments of the nucleoprotein by LCMV primed spleen cells. cDNA clones encoding the mouse and human T cell IL-1 receptors have been isolated and expressed in mammalian cells. The recombinant receptor binds IL-1 indistinguishably from the natural IL-1 receptor, and is functional in signal transduction. Deletion of the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor abolishes its signal transduction abilities. Sequence and secondary structure analysis suggest that the cytoplasmic segment of the iL-1 receptor binds a nucleotide. Experiments designed to test this hypothesis and to examine the mode of signal transduction will be presented. Also to be discussed are the mechanism of triggering of the receptor by IL-I. and the nature of IL-1 receptors expressed in other cell types such as B cells. it became evident that these subsets reflect different stages of helper T cell maturation before and after activation. Therefore, these T cell subsets have been designated as naive T cells (CD45R/2H4+, CDw29[4B4]-) and memory T cells (CD45R/2H4-, CDw29[4B4]+). We analysed the expression of these antigens in dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates from different benign skin diseases and cutaneous T cell lymphomas (chronic contact dermatitis (n=14), parapsoriasis en plaques (n=5), lymphomatoid papulosis (n=4), mycosis fungoides (n=15), Sezary's syndrome (n-2), pleomorphic T cell lymphoma (n=6) and high grade T cell lymphomas (~4)). In almost all cutaneous T cell infiltrates memory T cells were preferentially found whereas in the peripheral blood both subsets are equally distributed. This implicates, that T cells infiltrating the skin already have had contact with their respective antigen. Where the switch from naive to memory T cells takes place can not be answerded by our findings, as we have investigated rather longstanding skin diseases. However, these memory T cells, which can be activated more easily, make diseased skin more e f f e c t i v e in the nmDlification of an immune resnonse. organs and after several days of stimulation with antigen or mitogen and lymphokines. We find that fresh Th synthesize and secerte -IU,IFNg,IL3 and GMCSF but very little IL4 or IL.5 within 24-48 hours. This pattern resembles the pattern of lymphokines secreted by Thl cell lines. The Th responsible for this secretion are CD4 positive T cells which are long-lived since they disappear very slowly following adult thymectomy. They are also sensitive to the in vivo administration of ATS(antithyrn0cyte serum) and they express high levels of Pgp-1. The kinetics of lymphokine secretion and the phenotype of the cells suppon the hypothesis that lymphokine secretion from fresh lymphoid cells comes from a population of memory cells. In contrast we fmd that we can also stimulate a separate, ATS-resistant population to become lymphokine-secreting cells after four days of in v i m priming.These primed cultures rapidly synthesize an secrete large amounts of I U and IL5 in addition to IFNg , IL3 and GMCSF( A phenotype which could be combination of both Thl and Th2 helpers), when they are restimulated with Ag or mitogen. The cells whic are responsible are CD4 positive and have a shorter liespan since they decline considerably after adult thymectomy. We suggest that the lymphokine secreting cells detected after priming come from a population(s) of helper T cell precufiofi which have differentiated to become effectors. This generation 0: effectors requires lymphokines, especially E-4 andlor ILZ and APCs. Thus the development of helper Th appears to follow a similar pathway as that of cells of the B cell lineage developing into Ab-secreting cells and CD8 positive T cells which develop into cytotoxic effectors from precursors.",

Maximal IL-2 production induced by Con A at 10-14 days post-infection was only l/2 that observed for uninfected rabbits and this correlated well with a decrease in T cell proliferation ( < 35% that of normal rabbits) upon stimulation with Con A .

The human lymphocyte differentiation antigen CD8 is encoded by a single gene which gives rise to a 32 kDa glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface as a dimer, and in higher molecular weight forms. We demonstrate that the mRNA is alternatively spliced such that an exon encoding a transmembrane domain is deleted. that is secreted and exists primarily as a monomer. Messenger RNA corresponding to both forms is present in peripheral blood lymphocytes,(PBL), Con A activated PBL and three CD8+ T cell lines with the membrane form being the major species. ratio of mRNA for membrane CD8 (mCD8) and secreted CD8 (sCD8) exist. In addition, the splicing pattern we observe differs from the pattern found for the mouse CD8 gene. This mRNA is also alternatively spliced, but an exon encoding a cytoplasmic region is deleted giving rise to a cell surface molecule which differs in its cytoplasmic tail from the protein encoded by the longer mRNA. Neither protein i s secreted. This is one of the first examples of a different splicing pattern between two homologous mouse and human genes giving rise to very different proteins. This represents one mechanism of generating diversity during speciation. CD4' T cells in the rat can be divided into two non-overlapping subsets by theii reactivity with the monoclonal antibody MRC OX-22 which binds some of the high molecular weight forms of the CD45 antigen. Recent work, to be described has shown that the two subsets represent different stages of T cell maturation, with distinct T cell functions. The lymphokine repertoire of the memory T cell pool will be discussed with reference to the antigenic environment fmm which the cells are obtained.",

This model was suitable for studying T-T collaboration in that islet allograft immunity is CD4 dependent but rejection of the cultured islet graft is mediated by the CD8 cell. Recipient C57BY6 (B6) mice were grafted with MHC class Idisparate B6.C-H-2bml (bml) islets beneath the mal capsule. Islet grafts wen preaated for 7 days in 95% oxygen culture to reduce immunogenicity. Thirty days after grafting, recipient mice wen immunized with 1Oe6 live spleen cells from the strains indicated below. Rejection of the established graft was not trig-by challenge with donortype bml spleen cells, indicating that the MHC class I stimulus was insufficient to initiate all@ immunity. Further, immunization with a mixture of 1 M bml and 1Oe6 MHC class II-disparate B6.C-H-2bm12 (bml2) spleen cells failed to trigger host immunity. However, challenge with lOe6 (bml x bml2)Fl spleen cells t r i g g d acute rejection of the established bml islet grafts. The requirement for l i i presmtatidrecognition of class I and class 11 all* antigens to trigger allograft immunity indicates that the antigen-presenting (Apc) plays an essential role for T-T collaboration in vivo. Uature HLA-DR complexes are purported to spontaneously internalize from and recycle to the plasma membrane of B but not T lymphocytes. Using a neuraminidase protection assay, we have radiolabeled surface class I1 antigens on intact cells and cultured these cells under conditions which permit or prevent endocytosis; subsequently, surface glycoproteins on viable cells were desialylated and class I1 molecules were analyzed by iamunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A panel of buman B lymphoblastoid cell lines and activated tonsillar B cell blasts failed to exhibit any internalization of class I1 complexes; control transferrin receptor molecules were endocytosed as ascertained by insensitivity to neuraminidase digestion. Class II+ PBA blasts and Sezary cells of the T lineage were also deficient in detectable HLA-DR internalization. Results did not vary regardless of the time allowed for efficient endocytosis (1251 OK 3~Saethionine). or the addition of anti-class I1 monoclonal antibody during the chase period for endocytosis. Therefore. within the limits of sensitivity of this assay, class 11 complexes do not appear to be internalized, either spontaneously or uben crosslinked by antibody. recycling represent a dynamic pathvay for regulating surface expression of class I1 antigens or a means of associating with and presenting foreign antigenic peptides.

In previous studies of antigen-specific T cell responses in two distinct models of autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), Viiia villosa lectin binding (VV+) T cells have been shown to be necessary for effector T cell expression and mediation of TIN. In anti-tubular basement membrane disease, antigen-specifi VV+ T cells direct the phenotypic selection of CD8+ nephritogenic T cells in susceptible mouse strains (J. Immunol. 141, Nov. 1,1988) . This function is mediated by an antigen-binding, I-Js+ soluble protein factor. Current studies investigate the role of the T cell glycoprotein which binds VV lectin in mediating W+ T cell function. Using the previously described effector T cell induction assay, we found that N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNac) (at 25 mM but not 2.5 mM) inhibits VV+ T cell function and CD8+ effector T cell selection. When CD8+ effector T cell differentiation occurs in the presence of soluble factors derived from antigen-primed VV+ T cells, GalNAc is not inhibitory. These studies suggested that soluble Gal NAc may competitively bind to a soluble protein which stimulates VV+ T cells, in part by binding to the W lectin receptor, to synthesize andlor secrete their biologically active soluble factor. As an additional test of this hypothesis, we prepared detergent solubilized membranes from VV+ T cells and purified VV lectin binding proteins by affinity chromatography. Like GalNAc. these membrane derived lectin binding proteins also inhibit VV+ T cell function and CD8+ effector T cell selection. Inhibition by soluble 'lectin receptors' is dose dependent and is demonstrable with lectin binding glycoproteins derived from 15-20 x lo6 cells, in an assay utilizing 10 x106 VV+ cells. We are now further characterizing the lectin receptor and its endogenous ligand. Elementary bodies and outer membranes of Chlamydia trachomatis produce a high-titered IgG response in rabbits and mice as measured by ELISA and microscopic immunofluorescence assays. Western blot analysis of total elementary body protein identifies a 40kD major outer membrane protein (MOMP) as the predominant antigen. To identify the cbmical structure of the epitope, purified MOMP was subjected to chemical and enzymatic fragmentation and the resulting peptides were purified by HPLC and assayed for immunoreactivity. An immunoreactive 6kD cyanogen bromide peptide was amino-terminal sequenced and a series of overlapping synthetic peptides were synthesized and assayed for immunoreactivity. Sequential single amino acid deletions at both the NHZ and COOH termini allowed us to identify the precise epitope as a 12 amino acid peptide spanning residues 291-302 of MOMP. Two amino acid substitutions at positions 293 (PHE-GLY) and 300 (PRO-GLY) completely eliminated antibody binding. The 12-amino acid synthetic peptide is a potent immunogen producing high-titered antibody responses that are specific for the MOMP molecule.",

Class I heavy chain is synthesized in this cell line and associates with B2m. Transport of the class I appears to be blocked in the ER or cis4olgi as the majority of the class I glycoproteins are not processed to the Endo B resistant form. The ability of the cell to significantly increase expression of surface class I when the incubation temperature is lowered from 37OC to 22OC suggests that this gene may function to stabilize a particular conformation of the protein. Consistent with this is the increased sensitivity of class I molecules in the mutant as compared to the parent to degradation when cell lysates are incubated at elevated temperatures. The inability to immunoprecipitate class I antigens in the mutant is possibly due to the action of endogenous proteases present in these lysates. Two complementing approaches are being employed to isolate this gene and further analyze its role in class I biosynthesis. The first involves inactivation of the trans-acting gene by insertion of a retroviral vector and subsequent PCR amplification of regions flanking the vector. In another approach a cDNA library will be introduced into the mutant cell line and the cDNA will be reisolated from cells reexpressing surface class I. Houston. TX.

Grant RR-5511-23. W e have recently demonstrated and reported that substitution of anionic side chain carboxylic groups with aminoethylamide groups on protein antigens exhibits a pattern of enhanced immunogenicity both in vivo and in vitro. This enhanced immunogenicity was also observed in low responder strains of mice and we investigated the mechanism by which it is achieved. We examined antigen processing and presentation of native (nBSA) and modified BSA (mBSA) to T helper c e h isolated from C57/BL low responder mice. A greatly reduced amount of mBSA than nBSA was required to activate both nBSA and mBSA primed Th. Proliferation of nBSA and mBSA primed T cells increased in proportion to the amount of time of exposure of the antigen presenting cells (APC) to nBSA, peaking at 8h. Conversely, APC required less than 30 min exposure to mBSA to achieve optimal activation, indicating rapid uptake of mBSA. Paraformaldehyde fixed APC recognized mBSA without a lag phase processing, indicating that this event also occurred quite rapidly. APC processed nBSA w a s presented to primed T cells more effectively than the soluble antigen M shown by the increased rate of T cell proliferation. In contrast, mBSA was equally well presented to Th cells by APC M in soluble unprocessed form. Our data demonstrate that the reduced response in low responders is greatly enhanced by a modified antigen which is rapidly taken up and processed by APC. B cells which bear surface innunoglobulin (sIg) receptors specific for a particular antigen are abile t o present fragments of that antigen very efficiently t o T cells. This i s due. in part, t o the high affinity of the receptor, which facilitates antigen binding at low concentrations. Using TNP-ABC and specific antigen, we have demonstrated that the TNP-ABC process antigen very effectively.",

Both antigen and anti-Ig bound by TNP-ABC are degraded into small fragments which are released into the supernatant. However, the following differences have been found: 1) The rate of release of small fragments of TNP-antigen parallels the rate at which these cells become able to directly conjugate with T cells (a lneasure of antigen presentation), reaching a plateau between 4 and 6 hours. In contrast, the degradation of anti-Ig and release of fragnents continues for 12 hours. 2) Analysis of initial kinetics demonstrated that release of fragments of TNP-antigen begins 15 minutes after binding; there i s no significant release of anti-Ig fragrnents u n t i l about 30 minutes. 3) In contrast to anti-Ig where there i s significant accumulation of degradation intermediates within the cells, there i s very l i t t l e intracellular accumulation of intennediate-size fragments of TNP-antigen.

We have recently analysed the structure of the 7 / 6 T cell receptor (TCR) expressed by the normal human thymocyte clone CII. CII expresses a C ' 2 constant region that is a polymorphic form lacking a copy of an izternal exon; the sequence of this constant region accounts for the size of the 7 chain and noncovalent linkage of 7 and 6 chains in the CII TCR. In order to elucidate its role, this 7/6 TCR will be reconstituted in immortalized T-cell lines. In addition, the productively rearranged human 7 / 6 receptor will be transgenically introduced into mice in order to assess the effect of the complete receptor on the development of T cells. The humoral immune response to human immunodeficiency virus has been shown to contain antibodies which act to mediate the uptake of virus through Fc receptor mediated mechanisms. It is therefore possible that vaccination with the entire envelope polypeptide may present immunologic determinants that enhance infection.

T celh bearing the transgenic clonotype are positively selected by elements of the H-Zb MHC for expression on CD8' cells. Thus in the periphery of H-Zb animals 40-80% of the T cells are 1BZ1/CD8*. The same peripheral expression is observed when the transgenes are expressed in F1 animals bearing a \"neutral\" MHC haplotype (eg. H-Zb'*). However, when the transgene hi expressed in F1 animals which also express the H-2Ld gene product, negative selection occurs by clonal deletion. However, this deletion is functional rather than structural as the 1B2 clonotype is present on 10-40% of peripheral T cells. These cells are unusual in that they express neither of the characteristic peripheral molecules CD4 or CD8.

Immunity to disease caused by Neisseria menineitidis is associated with the presence of bactericidal and opsonic antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide (CPS), lipopolysaccharide and to outer membrane proteins (OMPs). The CPS of group A and C meningococci are proven efficacious vaccines, although the immunogenicity in infants is poor and the immunity is of short duration. The combination with T-helper epitopes will certainly improve the immunogenic properties of these T-independent (Ti,) antigens. The group B CPS is poorly immunogenic in humans probably because of tolerance due to structural similarity to host glycopeptides and/or glycolipids. We have focused our research onto the class 1 OMPs which show limited heterogeneity amongst meningococci. Murine monoclonal antibodies to these proteins are highly bactericidal in vitro and will be used to map B-cell epitopes. T-epitopes have been identified by theoretical prediction of immunodominant sites by analysis of the amino acid sequence of the OMP followed by their solid phase synthesis and subsequent testing for polyclonal activation of T-lymphocytes obtained from HL4-typed volunteers immunized with the OMP. In addition human T-cell clones are generated with OMPs and maintained with antigen, EBV-transformed B-cells, fresh feeders and rIL2. The clones are tested for antigen specificity, io vitro helper function, MHC restriction element, expression of surface markers and recognition of common meningococcal T-cell epitopes.",

To i n v e s t i g a t e the struct u r a l requirements f o r s i g n a l transduction via t h e CD2 pathway, we have expressed a number of cytoplasmic domain d e l e t i o n mutants of CD2 i n an antigen-specific murine T c e l l hybridoma t h a t produces interleukin-2 (IL-2) i n response t o MHC c l a s s I1 molecules. Hybridomas expressing a d e l e t i o n mutant, CDZAB, i n which the carboxyterminal 100 amino acids have been deleted, were able $0 bind LFA-3 compgrably t o the wild type CD2 protein. However, unlike the wild type CD2 hybridoma, CDZAB hybridomas were unable t o produce IL-2 i n response t o p a i r s of stimulatory anti-CDZ MAbs nor t o LFA-3 plus one anti-CD2 MAb.

The complexity of the CD2 pathway of a c t i v a t i o n i s demonstrated by expression of a second cytoplasmic domain d e l e t i o n mutant, CDZAS, i n which the terminal 42 amino acids have been removed, i n luding the region with g r e a t e s t conservation between mouse, r a t , and human species. CDZAS hybridomas were able t o respond t o antigen, t o LFA-3 p l y an anti-CDZ MAb, and t$ c e r t a i n p a i r s of anti-CDZ MAbs comparably with the wild type CDZ hybridomas.

We have examined the transcriptional regulation of murine V8 gene promoters by sequence (Anderson et al, 1988 PNAS 85:3551) and functional analysis. A transient transfection system and S1 nuclease anaFsis were employed to quantitate correctly initiated transcripts derived from the V68.3 promoter linked to a functionally rearranged V68.2 gene. Transcripts could be detected at similar levels in both T (YAC-l.BW5147) and B (5194) cells. Promoter deletion constructs reveals an essential cis-acting element located between -85 and -34 relative to the transcription start site. The basal level transcription from this promoter is reduced by >90% upon removal of these 51 base-pairs. This region contains the previously described decamer which is conserved in murine, human and rabbit V6 genes. DNase I footprint assays show protection of this decamer by nuclear extracts of murine T-cells. Deletion or mutation of this sequence eliminates specific protein binding as revealed by gel-mobility shift assays. The tissue specificity of protein binding to this motif has also been examined.c 202 THE ROLE OF V8 IN ANTIGEN: SELF MHC AND NON-SELF MHC RECOGNITION BY CLONED T CELLLINES, Jddy Baron, Pilar Portoles and Charles A. Janeway. Jr., Section of Innrmnobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510. Using a cloned T cell line reactive to antigen presented by self MHC and cross-reactiveto non-self MHC of five different MHC genotypes, we have asked which epitopes on the receptor are involved in recognition of each ligand. Cur analysis suggests that the VB region is associated with a high affinity binding site for non-self MHC and a low affinity binding site for self MHC in this system, in that anti-V8 antibodies inhibit responses to antigen:self MHC more effectively than expected while inhibiting responses to non-self MHC less effectively than expected. This clone uses V88.2 in its receptor. We have prepared a large number of cloned lines expressing the V8 gene in the receptor and examined their responses to antigen and to non-self MHC. In particular, most of a set of cloned T cell lines specific for myelin basic protein peptide Ac-1-9 presented by I-Au express V68.2, but only a fraction show alloreactivity, and the pattern of alloreactivity in each cloned line is different. Thus, alloreactivity may involve V8 as determined by antibody blocking analysis, but the response to non-self MHC clearly involves other portions of the receptor as well.lmmunogeniclty c m TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF THE HLA CLASS I1 ASSOCIATED INVARIANT CHAIN GENE.

Michael G. M a g e , Bernardetta Nardelli, and Louise McHugh, Lab. of Biochemistry, Division of Cancer Biology and Diagnosis, National CancerInstitute, Bethesda M D 20892. We have developed s general method for the simplified preparation of soluble multivalent macromolecular conjugates, by binding of biotinylated proteins to soluble p o l y a c r y l s m i d e -s t r e p t a v i d i n (PASA). The method may be potentially useful for construction of such reagents as complex immunogens, imaging reagents, and immunotoxins. We have used this method to produce soluble \"polyMHC\" molecules for low affinity binding measurements, and heteroconjugates that specifically label tumor cells with allogeneic I H C Class I antigens. Soluble linear polyacrylamide, of approximately one million k D , is partially deamidated by controlled alkaline hydrolysis to introduce carboxyl groups. These are activated by csrbodiimide at pH 3 . The reactive intermediate is separated from excess carbodiimide by gel filtration at 0 degrees, and reacted with streptsvidin at pH 8.5. The resulting conjugate, with approximately 20 streptavidin molecules per molecule of polyacrylamide, can in turn bind biotinylated proteins to produce soluble multivslent conjugates of known composition. The number of activated carboxyl groups per polyacrylamide molecule can be controlled by monitoring their hydrolysis at 0 degrees prior to conjugation with streptavidin.C mof Immunology, Msyo Clinic, Rochester, EM 55905.4 genomic DNA was obtained from cos H-2k 8.1 Hind I11 fragment (>9 kb) including 5' and3 ' flanking sequence which contained promoter and polyadenylation sites.

CD6 is a 120 kd glycoprotein expressed on the surface of T cells and a number of B cell leukemias and lymphomas. Recent reports indiratr that T cells treated with anti-CDJ and antLCD6 monoclonal antibodies followed by treatment with anti-mouse imniunoglobulin antibodies can be induced to proliferate by adding IL-2. Cross-linking of CD6 with antLCD6 monorlonal antibodies and anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies does not induce IL-2 dependent T cell proliferation but results in an increase in the cytoplasmic calcium concenrration. \\f-e h a w isolated two cDSAs encoding the CD6 antigen from a eucarpotic expression library prepared from mRS.4 isolated from the human T cell tumor line HP-B.4LL.

In addition, we have observed a severe depletion of mature CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells in mice expressing high levels of the 2B4p transgene plus a self-antigen, Mls-2a.

Yewdell and I. E. Coligan, Biological Resources Branch, and Laboratory of Viral Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892. Previously, influenza A virus specific murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been shown to recognize the viral hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), the three polymerases (PB1, PB2, PA) and a nonstructural protein (NS1). Peptidic epitopes recognized by murine CTL have been identified for the HA and NP molecules. The purpose of these studies was to identify viral peptides recognized in the context of H-2Dd with the ultimate objective fo doing binding studies with soluble H-2Dd molecules. To determine if any of the viral proteins were recognized in the context of the H-2D end class I molecules BlO.A(SR) mice (H-2Kb.H-2Dd. H-2Ld) were primed in vivo and stimulated in v i m with influenza A virus A/PIU8/34 and then assayed in a Wr-release assay against influenza or mock infected P815 (H-2d) or L cells (H-2k) uansfected with either the H-2Dd or H-2Kb gene. As previously demonstrated the H-2Kb class I molecule was a poor presenter of influenza antigens, while the influenza infected H-2Dd transfected L cells were lysed by the BlO.A(SR) effector cells. The specific viral protein recognized in the context of the H-2Dd molecule was identified by assaying BlO.A(SR) effector cells against L cells hansfected with the H-2Dd or H-2Kb gene infected with either influenza A or one of several influenza-vaccinia recombinant viruses.",

We have studied the ability of isolated subpopulations of lymphocytes from the autoimmune mouse model, w L / W J / l p r / l p r ( l p r ) , to proliferate in response to mitogenic signals and to express lymphokine genes in vivo. This mouse strain develops a lupus-like disease along with massive accumulation of an unusual subpopulation of CD4-, CDE-, Thyl+, B220+ T lymphocytes. We show that FACS-purified Thyl+, B220' cells proliferate very little in response to IL-2 or IL-4 plus PYA and ionomycin (I), or to IL-2 or IL-4 in anti-CD3 coated microwells. Thyl+, B220-(CD4+ or CDE+) cells from the same mice respond normally to lymphokines. Culture with both lymphokines results in additive proliferative effects, suggesting that the two lymphokines affect separate populations. Culture of CD4-, CDE-T cells for 3 days with IL-2 plus PMA + I resulted in increased numbers of CDE+ and decreased numbers of B220+ cells, and expression of IL-2 receptors. Cultures with IL-4, PYA + I induced similar phenotypic changes with a small increase in IL-4 receptors but little induction of IL-2 receptor:. Thus, the CD4-, CDE-cells do not express IL-2 or IL-4 receptors i n vivo but can be induced to do so i n v i t r o . Finally, freshly isolated CD4-, CDE-or Thyl+, B220+ cells spontaneously transcribe high levels of IFN7 and TNFa d N A . These two lymphokines have many synergistic effects on immune function i n vivo. The fact that the CD4-, CDE-T cells fail to proliferate in response to lymphokines or other mitogenic signals in their in vivo state supports the idea that these accumulating cells may derive from single-positive precursors which do respond to growth factors.",

Clevenger and Mike B. Prystowsky, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 To determine the identity of genes in T lymphocytes that are regulated in a growth-associated manner, and thus the gene products that are necessary for the process of T cell proliferation, a cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+ RNA from 20 hr IL2-stimulated murine T helper cells. Differential screening of this library allowed for the selection of clones whose expression is upregulated in late Gl/S phase cells as compared to resting cells. Sequencing of a high frequency, 1800 bp clone identified it as the gene encoding vimentin, an intermediate filament protein. Like the hamster vimentin gene, this murine vimentin cDNA contains an extended 3 ' untranslated region when compared to a human vimentin cDNA (296 bp vs. 57 bp, respectively). Vimentin mRNA levels in T cells increase 20-fold following 20 hr of I U stimulation (late G1/S phase), and reach 40 times the vimentin mRNA level of resting cells by 70 hr (at which time the cells are cycling asynchronously). Vimentin protein levels increase approximately 2-fold as the cells enter the S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. discrepancy in the degree of accumulation of vimentin mRNA vs. protein as T cells progress through the cell cycle is not currently understood, and will be addressed in future studies.

Chou, Margarita Vainiene, Ruth Whitham, Dennis Bourdette, Selene C.H.-J. Chou, George Hashim and Halina Offner, Neuroimmunology Research 151D, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Portland, OR 97201.In animals, the selection in vitro of T cell lines to myelin basic protein (MBP) can define immunodominant and encephalitogenic epitopes which are preferentially associated with Class I1 major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules of each strain. These principles were used to evaluate the specificity and MHC restriction of fourteen human MBPreactive T cell lines selected from normal individuals and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or other neurological diseases (OND). The four normal T cell lines recognized single, separate immunodominant MBP epitopes which were restricted by H U molecules from the DR or in one case the DP Class I1 locus. In contrast, the HS and OND T cell lines recognized multiple MBP epitopes, each in association with a discrete Class I1 MHC molecule from the DR or DQ locus. Overall. H U -D R molecules were used preferentially to associate with epitopes on human MBP, restricting 26/33 responses. Thus, as predicted from animal studies, T cells from each individual responded to different immunodominant epitopes on human MBP in association with distinct MHC Class I1 molecules. These data provide the first evidence of genetically restricted human T cell recognition of potentially encephalitogenic epitopes of MBP.C563 UNRESPONSIVENESS TOA FOREIGN ANTIGEN CAUSED BY TOLERANCE TO SELF ANTIGEN Damir VidoviC and Polly Matzinger, Basel Institute for Immunology, CH-4005 Basel. In mice, two sets of genes govern the immune response to the synthetic antigen GT. One maps to the MHC and behaves like a typical immune response (Ir) gene. The second is a background gene encoding a cell surface structure found on B cells. Mice which express (and are therefore tolerant of) one form of this structure do not respond to GT. Thus tolerance of self generates holes in the T cell repertoire, partially crippling the immune system. The significant difference between the frequencies of specific anti-GT-TCR-bearing T cells in responder and nonresponder mice suggests clonal deletion as a mechanism of immune tolerance. molecule (Hmt), encoded d i s t a l t o H-2 on Chr. 17, and the maternally transmitted f a c t o r ( M t f ) whose inheritance implies a mitochondrial o r i g i n .

Long, Malaria Research Group, Dept. of Microbiology, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA 19102 The 195 kDa major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (pf PMMSA) is a potential candidate for the development of a blood-stage malarial vaccine. We have focused on an analogous 230 kDa antigen of the murine malarial parasite, Plasmodium yoellii, as a model vaccine antigen. Previously we reported the cloning and sequencing of a 2.1 kb portion of the gene encoding the C-terminal 77 kDa of the 9 PMMSA, containing the B-cell epitope recognized by a passively protective monoclonal antibody, McAb 302. To localize this B-cell determinant, we have produced recombinant peptides of 74, 4 0 , 34, 17, and 10 kDa which bear the epitope recognized by McAb 302. The results indicate that this B-cell epitope is located within the most carboxyl region of the P J PMMSA which contains a series of ten cysteine residues, also found in the PMMSA of p. falciparum. Reduction of disulfide bonds as well as the deletion of Cys-607 of the cloned sequence, results in the loss of the expression of this epitope. The localization of this immunologically relevant B-cell epitope to a region of the molecule displaying considerable homology with the pf PMMSA, may impact on the development of an effective blood-stage vaccine.

The ability of murine neonatal spleen cells to present antlgen to D10-G4.1 (D10) T-helper cells and produce growth factors in response to subsequent cellular interactions were studied. The ability of neonatal spleen cells to present antigen and to stimulate DlO cells is low. During antigen presentation antigen presenting spleen cell populations produce IL-1. However, neonatal spleen cells do not respond to the same levels as do adult spleen cells. The addltlon of exogenous IL-1 cannot repair the antigen presentation by neonatal cells. Experiments in which the antigen processing and presentation steps were separated from those requiring growth factor induction and secretion, demonstrate that neonatal spleen cells are impaired in their ability to perform adequate antigen processing and presentation. Neonatal spleen cells are as competent as adult cells to cooperate with T-helper cells and secrete growth factors, provided antigen processing and presentation is performed by fully competent adult spleen cells. No suppressor mechanisms responsible for the low antigen presentation of neonatal cells could be detected. The impairment of neonatal spleen cells in the initial stages of antigen processing and presentation leads to low levels of growth factor production and is the major determinant in the ineffectual stimulation of T-helper cells by neonatal spleen cells. c618 I D E N T I E \" OF HTEPER T CEfL E F ' m P F S FR3l GP 160 OF HIV ' ME USE OF Department of MiQDbiolcqy and Inmmology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY 12208our laboratory has devehpd a new, pcrwerful tedylique for investigating the imams respnse to peptide epitopes, involving the covalent coupling of peptide to phc@mtldylethanolamine,",

Serum samples were drawn Before and one hour after each antibody injection and approximately three weeks after treatment. ELISA assays for circulating murine IgCl were performed on all samples throughout the treatment period and showed that a trough serum level greater than 10 u g h 1 was achieved consistently in patients treated with 0.5 or 1 mg/kg/day. ELISA values for human antibodies to murine IgG on post treatment samples were compared to background values of pretreatment serum and to a positive control value of serum from a cynomolgous monkey immunized with a murine IgCl MAb specific for CD4 (Leu 3a). Sera assayed during the treatment period showed no signs of immune elimination of the mouse IgC. Two of two patients receiving 1.0 mg/kg and two of four treated with 0.2 mg/kg developed IgM antibodies to murine Ig and one of each group made also IgC. There was a difference between the magnitude of the IgG response to an irrelevant murine IgCl (anti-KLH) and the immunizing MAb in one individual. indicating an anti-idiotype response.

Muthukkaruppan, Department of Immunology, School of Biological Sciences, MaduraiKanaraj University, Madursi -625 021, India.In order to identify the mycobacterial antigens reacting with serum antibodies and to see whether there is any qualitative differences among lepronatous (LL) and tuberculoid (TT/BT) leprosy patients and their contacts with reference to their anti-mycobacterial antibodies, the techniques of SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis were employed. It was found that of the 33 major bands i n BCG sonicate after SDS-PAGE, the leproaatous patients had antibodies to 32 bands and in tuberculoid patientsto 28 bands. More importantly, four of these bands (56 Kd. 48 Kd, 32 Kd and 20 Kd) were unique to lepromatous sera and one (44 Kd) to tuberculoid sera. Antibodies to these bands were not present in the other types of patients or healthy individuals tested. Further, it was found that only IgG antibodies demonstrated such differences among the patients and normal groups. And, by 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by imeuaoblot, an additional BCG protein of PI 5.5 and molecular weight of 42 Kd was identified to have antibodies only in LL patients. Similar studies were also conducted with M. leprae sonicate. Of the 20 bands by SDS-PAGE, antibodies of IgG class were detected for 16 bands in LL sera and 13 bands in TT/BT sera. Three bands of 56 Kd, 21 Kd and 20 Kd were unique to the LL sera. Thus, a total of seven qualitative differences could be identified between the serum antibodies of LL and TT/BT patients.

Richard Murray, Gregory Frank, and Albert Zlotnik. Department of Immunology, DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA 94304. We have previosuly reported that thymocytes proliferate to Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and phorbol myristate actetate (PMA). The subsets that proliferate under these conditions are the CD4-8-, CD4+8and CD4-8+ thymocytes. We have been interested in identifying the natural stimulant that PMA mimics in this system. Here we report that monoclonal antibodies directed against the E chain of the murine CD3 complex stimulate proliferation of thymocytes in the presence of IL-4. The characteristics of this proliferation are similar between thymocytes grown in IL-4/PMA and thymocytes grown in IL-4/anti-CD3. However, one difference concerns the double positive CD4+8+ subset. This subset disappears within 24 hours of culture in IL-4 and PMA but is present at this time in cells grown with IL-4/anti-CD3. This effect of P W appears to be specific for CD4+8+ since the single positive subsets (CD4+8and CD4-8+) and not affected and are expanded by IL-4 and PMA. In some subsets (CD4+8-) anti-CD3 induces proliferation by itself but this proliferation is dependent on endogenous lymphokine production (IL-2 and IL-4). C652 Suresh Savarirayan, and Chella S. David: Departments of Immunology and Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic. Rochester, MN 55905. HLA-B27 is present in 60-90% of the patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The pathogenesis of these diseases is not known, however, reactive arthritis often occurs in HLA-B27 positive individuals following infection with Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterides , Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri , Campylobacter jejuni or Chlamydia trachomatis. In an effort to develop an animal model of reactive arthritis, Yersinia enterocolitica 0:E WA was injected intravenously into HLA-B27 transgenic mice and their corresponding negative siblings. To date, no reactive arthritis has been observed, however, at a dose of lo4 or lo5, several of the mice developed hind limb paralysis. All but one of these mice were HLA-B27 positive as shown in the table below: B27 TRANSGENIC MICE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO YERSINIA ENEROCOLITICA INFECTION THAN HLA-B27 NEGATIVE LITTERMATES. Cheryl L. Nickerson, Harvinder S. Luthra, Upon gross dissection and histopathologic examination, spinal abscesses were found in the paralyzed animals. In summary, HLA-B27+ mice develop substantially more spinal abscesses and symptoms of paralysis than their HLA-BZ7littermates. Consequently, the HLA-B27 gene appears to induce susceptibility in mice to acute infection with Yersinia enterocolitica. Supported by a grant from the Minnesota Arthritis Foundation.",

Rich, Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology. and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030. MLR T suppressor fdctor (MLR-TsF) is the product of allantigen primed Thy-11, CD8t murine lymphocytes. MLR-TsF suppresses T cell proliferation in response to H-2 alloantigens in MLR and to Con A, and acts at least in part by interfering with IL-2 dependent activation events. Recently we hdVe shown thdt MLR-TsF also profoundly decreases the BmOIlnt of steady stdte mRNA for IPN-y in Con A treated splenocytes. In contrast, induced message Lor IL-2 and IL-2R. and constitutive message for 6-actin are unaffected. Neither suppressiori of proliferdtion nor inhibition of IFN-y mRNA are reversed by the addition of rIL-2. Sirice the multipotent cytokirie TGF-6 has been recently shown to be both antiproliferdtive to some T dnd 8 cells and inhibitory to the production of certain lymphokines, the role of TOF-p as d possible constituent of MLR-TsF was examined. It was found that MLR-TsF contained slgrllficantly more TGF-6 than control factors. Exogenous TOP-61, like MLR-TsF, decredsed the level of Con A induced IFN-y but not IL2R or actin mRNA. Prettedtmeiit of either exogenous TGF-61 or MLR-TsF with anti-TGP-B antibody blocked the suppressive effect on IFN-y transcripts without increasing levels of other tran scripts. Our iesults suggest that TOF-61, or a crossreactive product of the TGF-6 gene family, is an active component of MLR-TsF and largely accounts for its IFN-y reguldtory effect. Interestingly, addition of anti-TGF-8 alone to Con A activated T celis resulted in InCredSed levels of IFN-y transcripts, implying an autocrine or paracrine role for TGF-6 in normal immunoregulatory processes.

Purified CD4' activated and cultured in the presence of IL-4 acquire the CD8 antigen, whereas single positive CD8' cells remain single positive when cultured in IL-4. To ensure that IL-4 mediates this effect on single CD4' T cells, a cloning experiment was performed with IL-4 as growth factor. T cells were activated with the EBV transformed B cell ]Y in an MLC and cloned 6 days later by limiting dilution in the presence of IL-4 and an anti IL-2 Mab. As comparison the same T cells were also cloned in IL-2 and ananti IL-4 antibody. The cloning efficiencies in 1L-4 and IL-2 were comparable. Forty-seven percent of the clones isolated in IL-4 were CD4+CD8*, whereas none of the clones isolated in IL-2 were double positive (DP). Northern blot analysis showed that IL-4 induced CDB gene expression in CD4+ T cell clones. The antigen specific cytotoxic activity o f a DP CTL clone CD506 isolated in IL-4, which was specific for HLA-DR on ]Y cells was blocked by an anti-CO4 mAb and not by anti-CDB. Clone CD506 could kill Dandi cells but only in the presence of anti-CD8 mAbs. Anti CD8 could block CD506 mediaetd cytolysis against Daudi cells coated with anti CD3 mAbs. In contrast anti CD8 was unable to affect anti C03 induced cytotoxic activities mediated by clone CD506 cultured in IL-2 which did not express CD8. Parlard, R. de Waal Malefyt and J. E. deVries.

Both a thymic epithelial cell clone (3D.1) and a thymic macrophage clone (IG18.M) produce IL-6 as demonstrated by mRNA analysis and bioactivity. Efforts to find IL-6 in a cDNA library from unstimulated CD4-8thymocytes were unsuccessful. I G 1 8 . M but not 3D.1 produced TNFa.

Thomas2, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI48109-0620.Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that peptide antigens associate directly with MHC molecules. However, there may be other membrane structures involved in peptide antigen uptake and retention. Our studies have identified a class of membrane-bound proteins which form stable associations with a number of peptide antigens. These membrane-bound proteins, which we have termed specific antigen retention structures, have been shown to be important for T cell responses. They are found on a variety of cell types, suggesting cellular heterogeneity, and form complexes with a variety of peptides, suggesting molecular heterogeneity. In some cases a covalent bond is formed between the retention structure and the peptide antigen. The existence of a free unmodified COOH terminal group appears to be critical for this covalent bond formation. Recent information, derived from both biochemical and EM autoradiographic studies, suggests that these antigen-retention structures are rapidly turned over in cells and may transport peptide antigens into various subcellular compartments, perhaps thereby facilitating their interaction with MHC molecules.

W e have examined the requirements for non-activated allogeneic B lymphocytes to serve as stimulator cells in primary mixed lymphocyte cultures(MLC). The generation of a response was totally dependent on the use of low density B cells; small B cells did not stimulate a response under any conditions. Moreover, the ability of low density B cells to stimulate the response was dependent on the number of stimulator cells added to the cultures. At high cell input levels low density B cells stimulated a response without any further modification to the cultures. In contrast, at low cell input levels the generation of an optimal response required the addition of both IL1 and IL6 to the culture. Neither lymphokine by itself enhanced the ability of allogeneic B cells to stimulate the MLR. Our results suggest that low density B cells have attained a differentiation state that allows them to stimulate an mixed lymphocyte response. Furthermore, when the dose of alloantigen is limiting, both IL1 and IL6 enhance the primary proliferative response of T lymphocytes.STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL IMAGE EXPRESSION: EPITOPE MIMICRY BY ANTI-IDIOTYPIC SEQUENCES IN REVERSE ORIENTATION, D.W.

Analysis of the fine specificity of HAl-specific CTL clones demonstrated that these CTL clones can be subdivided into at least two group based on their patterns of recognition of closely related influenza H2N2 field strains and a monoclonal antibody derived variant of A/Guiyang/4/57. Using a series of nested synthetic peptides spanning the 202-221 region, the minimal amino acid residues necessary for recognition by the two groups of CTL clones were defined and found to consist of two separate but overlapping sites. Sequence comparison of the HA of the A/JAP/305/57, the influenza field isolates and the monoclonal antibody derived variant has identified two amino acids, Asn at position 207 and Gly at position 215, that are critical for T cell recognition. Thus, animo acid substitutions induced either by antigenic drift or by monoclonal antibody selection can affect class I CTL recognition. pretreatment with a n t m e s reactive with Class 11 MHC anti-has previously been reported to be successful in EXOV~~KJ a n t i g e n -W i r q dendritic cells (m) fran rodent tissue grafts.
