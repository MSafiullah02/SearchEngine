The overall system consists of two loosely coupled components, namely an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). The ELS controls head- and taillights, setting their brightness depending on the surroundings and user preference. At the same time, the SCS controls the vehicle\u2019s speed, again by taking into account the environment as well as parameters given by the driver. Obviously, both are safety critical components, rendering safety and security a development priority.",

Our approach differs from the ones usually followed by the ABZ community: we do not employ a fully formal development method. Instead, we attempted an approach closer to what might happen in industries, where formal methods are not common yet. To do so, we implemented both the ELS and the SCS directly in (MISRA) C, following a test-driven development workflow. Only afterwards, we performed formal verification attempts directly on the C code, using the CBMC model checker [11]. Both MISRA C and CBMC will be introduced more thoroughly in Sects. 2.1 and 4.2 respectively. Test-driven development and mocking of test objects will be presented in Sect. 2.2.",

Often, formal methods practitioners claim to hold a high ground over \u201ctraditional\u201d software development or at least that there rarely are disadvantages [7, 14]. The argument seems convincing; yet, we are not aware of any (case) study comparing two teams working on the same project, one employing a formal approach and the other working \u201ctraditionally\u201d. For this case study, we aim at providing a baseline that can be compared to fully formal approaches or other approaches combining formal and informal verification, e.g., as suggested for spacecrafts [21]. We opted to postpone verification as much as possible, as one would expect a group focusing on embedded systems to work. This allows a fair evaluation of (dis-)advantages of the individual approaches. Our aim is to examine, whether a rigorous approach is beneficial in the context of the case study. If so, we hope to add to the body of evidence that formal methods actually are beneficial compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d software development.",

There are several features rendering our approach unique: Firstly, as the implementation is written in C, it could be directly deployed to an embedded system. Models written in formal specification languages would have to be refined to an implementation level before code can be generated. Furthermore, code generators usually are not proven and might introduce new errors. In cases where code generation is not easily applicable, side-by-side development of code is suggested. However, this approach is error-prone as well.",

Code that interacts with sensors or user input is separated, i.e., it could immediately be linked to actual hardware. Additionally, our implementation makes use of real threads, just as the sub-components of the system would run in parallel. We expect that most specifications using formal methods simply allow some non-determinism concerning the ordering of state transitions. This has some more consequences: Our implementation allows real-time simulation of the system, whereas state transitions using formal methods usually happen instantly and do not amount for any time elapsed during calculations. This also allows usage of our implementation for hardware-in-the-loop tests, which are common for automotive (cf. [13, 20]) in order to test the entire system.",

Others definitely should not activate the headlight (e.g., if the brightness falls below the specified threshold, as passing cars and the setting sun might trigger the brightness sensor). Also, it does not have any constraints regarding the light rotary switch: if the switch is in the \u201coff\u201d position, we think the ambient light should not activate at all.
