The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor. These results suggest that higher compliance with PPE usage and personal hygiene has the potential to decrease the number of infections and shorten epidemic duration. Individually initiated social isolation was effective when initiated in response to a single infected contact. The combination of social isolation and PPE resulted in very low levels of infection. Our model suggests that widespread application of social distancing through government control can drastically reduce viral spread; even in the absence of widely adopted social distancing protocols, high use of PPE can also dramatically reduce the viral spread while short-duration quarantine following exposure to an infected individual was less effective.",

            "text": "One key parameter of the viral spread is the contact rate between infected and non-infected individuals [3] . As the number of contacts increases, the probability of getting the virus increases [11, 12] . While modeling contacts can be done in mean-field, statistical, and metapopulation SIR models [1, [13] [14] [15] [16] , agent-based models provide a way to directly investigate how the connectedness of the social network influences viral spread [17, 18] In this paper, we examine three types of social distancing and control measures that can influence the viral spread in a social network. The first type is social distancing imposed on the social network at a global scale, where the likelihood of social distancing is applied uniformly to all agents in the network. This form of social distancing serves as a proxy for government policies such as shutting down businesses and issuing shelter in place orders [19] . The second type of social distancing occurs when agents have social connections that are infected and symptomatic [2, 20] . In this case, agents isolate from their neighbors in the network if they are surrounded by enough symptomatic neighbors. This type of behavior is frequently recommended by government authorities, though enforcement is sometimes limited and so requires that agents choose the appropriate action [19] . The third type of control measure involves the reduction of the rate of viral spread, for example through personal protective equipment (PPE) such as wearing a mask in public to reduce viral transmission [20, 21] . We examine how each of these measures alone and in concert with each other influence the viral outbreak.",

Reductions in viral shedding were associated with the primary partition in the regression tree in Fig. 2 . Viral shedding rates below 15 relative to an unmitigated value of 25 were associated with a mean number of infections of 46 of 500 agents. Reduced viral shedding rates with social distancing over 25% led to overall infection of approximately 2% of the population. If the overall viral shedding is reduced dramatically to 1/5 of the unmitigated rate, even without additional social distancing, less than 1% of the population becomes infected. Achieving low levels of infections in populations without reducing viral shedding requires significantly higher levels of top-down imposed social distancing (over 75%) which results in an approximately 1% infection rate in the population. If below 75% of the agents are social distancing, the infection rates for the populations are much higher; these range from a low of 21% (if individuals self-isolate in response to one infected social contact) all the way up to 97% with poor adherence to social distancing. Thus, with a higher level of viral shedding, it becomes important to have agents self-isolate when a social contact becomes symptomatic. Even if this occurs, the infection rate in the population is an order of magnitude higher (10% vs. 1%) then if the viral shedding was reduced. Failure to achieve this strict social distancing in response to an infected social contact results in a wide-spread outbreak (approximately 62% of the population infected). ",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling can provide tools to better understand epidemic dynamics and can vary from purely theoretical to more data driven and predictive [26] . While a simple model such as this one should not be used to make large-scale policy recommendations, it can provide a framework for specific hypothesis testing. Also, our model may be applicable to social networks of smaller size exhibiting small world characteristics, such as seen in college settings [32] . Here we use the model to ask several specific questions about how different behaviors might impact population infection rates. We specifically examine three main actions that can be taken to curb the SARS-CoV-2 spread: 1) government imposed social distancing; 2) behaviorally induced social isolation following virus exposure and 3) infection rate reduction, e.g. through behavioral adaptation through PPE or increased hand-washing and disinfecting. Early in the pandemic, government imposed social distancing was the primary tool used to slow infection rates or as commonly described \"flatten the curve\" [1] . Actions taken are quite varied and there is generally no uniform agreement about how much social distancing is necessary to significantly slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To examine the full potential for social distancing we examine a wide range of possible scenarios varying from no official social distancing to extreme social distancing (90%). While the two extreme scenarios are easy to envision (zero social distancing is business as usual and 90% is all but non-essential businesses closed), more moderate social distancing scenarios are harder to translate into direct societal actions. Nevertheless, we find a clear phase transition with social distancing in our small-world models. In general, social distancing compliance below 65% results in a wide-spread outbreak, while social distancing compliance above 75% contains the virus to low levels. For our secondary simulations over a refined parameter space, in the absence of stringent individual social distancing responses we observe that there is a phase transition that occurs as the percentage of agents socially distancing changes from 73% to 74%. While it is difficult to relate these transitions to specific policies that may be put in place, it is apparent that aggressive social distancing policies are required to contain an outbreak. Moreover, social distancing measures that allow for more inter-agent contact will likely allow rampant viral spread. In addition to government actions, individual behavior taken during the pandemic can greatly affect the dynamics of the pandemic. Most governments have issued guidelines for social isolation if in contact with a diseased individual. The most commonly recommended guideline is 14 days of self-isolation to avoid exposing other individuals [6, 8, 10] . However, despite these official guidelines, self-isolation following exposure requires that infected individuals inform their contacts and that exposed individuals voluntary comply. Given these caveats, we wanted to understand how self-isolation following an infected symptomatic social contact would influence final disease progression. In this model, self-imposed social distancing occurs only on the days when the agent has sufficiently many symptomatic contacts in the network. Thus, our model incorporates self-imposed social distancing as highly responsive to an agent's short-term perceptions regarding infection risks within their community. Interestingly, for self-isolation to negatively impact the number of infections, an extreme level of responsiveness was needed by the agents involved. In our model, it was necessary for self-isolation to occur following exposure to only one infected agent. If self-isolation occurred following the symptomatic infection of two or more contacts, the effect on viral spread was minimal. Given the high number of asymptomatic infected people with SARS-CoV-2 [15, 27] , it is likely that many individuals who have come in contact with an infected individual are not aware of their exposure. Our findings also highlight the well-known fact that contact tracing following an individual's positive test is critical for limiting the spread of the infection [4] .",

While this behavior is widely adopted in Asian countries that had experience with prior epidemics, it was much slower to catch on in Western  Fig 7. Social Distance Probability and Viral Shedding. Social distance probability vs. viral shedding, with social distance threshold and length of epidemic indicated by color and size. Longer outbreaks occur with low social distance probability and high viral shedding rates. countries [21, 28] . Mask wearing can significantly reduce viral shedding since individuals wearing a mask have a reduced chance of passing the virus on to others. Yet this policy remains controversial and adoption of mask wearing has been highly variable [30, 31] . Mask wearing in our model is captured by viral shedding. In our model, if the viral shedding rate is very small, then the epidemic does not spread, With moderate rate of viral shedding, the social distance threshold at which someone decides to self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected individual becomes much more important. In our model, if the social distance threshold is set to 1 (agents self-isolate after coming into contact with at least one infected agent), then the final total infection rate in the population is approximately 12%. However, if the behaviorally induced social distancing does not take place or takes place at a higher threshold, then the final infection is much larger with the overall infection rate in the population approximately 62%. Finally, when the viral shedding in our model was set at a high level of 25% (simulating a comparatively more infectious disease), the government imposed social distancing was required to be greater than 80% to control the outbreak, resulting in an approximately 1% infection rate in the population. Other less stringent social distancing conditions result in a viral infection rate between 25% and 97.5%.",

Social distancing controls in this model exhibit a sharp phase transition regarding total number of infections, either when imposed at a large scale by government mandates or when based on individual response to infected contacts. Our models suggest that in order to be effective, mandatory social distancing such as stay-at-home orders need to be broadly applied across all segments of society with a high degree of adherence by individuals. Alternatively, self-isolation must be immediately enacted if a social contact is known to be infected. Finally, if it is possible to reduce viral shedding through adherence to mask wearing, then the size of the final infected population can be significantly reduced.",
