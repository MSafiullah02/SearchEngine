            "text": "Adamantanes, formally designated tricyclo[3.3.1.1]decanes, are structurally unusual compounds where four cyclohexane rings are fused to each other in a particularly strain-free, all chair conformation. Oligo-oxa-adamantanes contain oxygens in place of methylene linkages within the structure and play a variety of roles in nature; from the infamous neurotoxin from the puffer fish tora fugu, tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Figure 1\n) [1], to plant natural product steroids such as daigremontianin [2]. Not all adamantane derivatives are extremely toxic, and many synthetic derivatives such as amantadine are used clinically (Figure 1) [3]. Amantadine is used as an antiviral agent [3], and as a muscle relaxant in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease [4]. Other drugs include rimantadine (against influenza A) [5], tromantadine (against herpes simplex virus), [6] and memantine (N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor antagonist) [7]. In order to add potential cytoprotective functionality [8], oligo-oxa-adamantanes have recently been conjugated to vitamin B6 (pyridoxal) to create a new class of adamantanes\u2014the bananins (Figure 1) [9]. We have synthesized six bananin derivatives\u2014bananin (BAN), iodobananin (IBN), adeninobananin (ADN), vanillinbananin (VBN), eubananin (EUB), and ansabananin (ABN). The synthesis of bananin was described [9], the synthesis of IBN and ADN will be reported elsewhere (A.J.K., submitted), and the final three are described in this report.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by infection with the SARS coronavirus (SCV) [10, 11, 12]. SCV was rapidly sequenced following its identification [13, 14], leading to the recognition of a number of possible drug targets. Although treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids has been shown to have a slight positive effect [15], side-effects [16] and lack of activity of ribavirin in cell culture [17] highlight the need for more effective treatments. Most recent anti-SCV drug development has targeted the viral main protease, also called the 3CL protease, and following an initial crystal structure [18], a structure together with inhibitors was solved [19]. Other classes of boronic-acid-based protease inhibitors have also been identified [20], and large-scale screens have identified SCV inhibitors effective against the protease [21]. We and collaborators have also recently identified inhibitors of the SCV helicase, the protease and spike-mediated viral entry by a chemical genetics approach [22]. In this paper we focus specifically on the SCV NTPase/helicase. Drugs targeting viral helicases have had marked success in animal models of herpes simplex virus [23, 24], and there has been progress in targeting the hepatatis C virus helicase [25]. We have previously cloned, purified, and performed an initial biochemical characterization of the SCV helicase [26]; our results showed that the helicase exhibited strict 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 polarity, consistent with contemporary reports from another group [27]. It has also been shown recently that the SCV helicase possesses an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity that may be involved in capping viral RNA [28].",

It is clear from previous work on another member of the Nidovirales order, equine arterivirus (EAV), that the metal binding domain is essential to viral viability [29, 30]\u2014this is also likely to be the case for closely related SCV. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the bananin series of compounds on both the ATPase and helicase activities of the SCV helicase, and also test bananin against SCV in cell culture. We find that bananin and three of its derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the ATPase and helicase activities of the SCV helicase, and that bananin inhibits SCV replication at a concentration significantly below that at which it is toxic to the cell. Further cell culture studies suggest that bananin inhibits intracellular activities mechanistically involved with key viral processes, as opposed to the viral entry step. These results are consistent with this class of drugs targeting the SCV helicase within the cell.",

            "text": "The bananins were synthesized by the reaction of phloroglucinol (most likely in its triketo tautomeric form) with aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution [9]. Generally, acidic catalysis was used due to the degradation of pyridoxal under highly basic conditions. Alkaline catalysis was used for reaction with aromatic aldehydes such as vanillin. Bananin synthesis is driven by the creation of the highly symmetric trioxa-adamantane-triol (TAT) cage system. The prototypical compound of the TAT series, the vitamin B6-derived bananin (BAN) or 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol, can be iodinated with subsequent oxidation to iodobananin (6\u2032-iodobananin 5\u2032-carboxylic acid, IBN). The iodine in IBN can be replaced by various substituents as exemplified by the synthesis of adeninobananin (6\u2032-adeninobananin 5\u2032-carboxylic acid hydrochloride, ADN) using an activated adenine nucleobase derivative. Interestingly, BAN is susceptible to Michael addition with the natural product eugenol, isolated from the essential oil of cloves (Syzygium aromaticum). This NaOH-catalyzed addition leads to eugenolbananin (eubananin, EUB), which can be transformed by cyclic hemiketal condensation into the ansa-compound ansabananin (ABN), inspired by ansamycins such as rifamycin and geldanamycin [31]. In the aromatic aldehyde series, vanillin was reacted with phloroglucinol to yield vanillinbananin (VBN) or 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol. It is expected that numerous naturally occurring aldehydes can be introduced to form the corresponding TATs with phloroglucinol in 3.33 M aqueous NaOH. The bananin group of compounds represents, to our knowledge, an array of completely new adamantane derivatives, which may be easily diversified by reacting various aromatic aldehydes with phloroglucinol.",

We used a newly developed fluorimetric assay based on the very strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorophore Cy3 to the quencher Black Hole Quencher 2 (BHQ2). A similar approach has been outlined very recently in assaying the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 helicase [34]. However, as we have recently shown that the SCV helicase holds strict 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality [26], we designed a system with a 5\u2032-oligo(dT) overhang. The principle behind this new assay is outlined in Figure 4A. There is a Cy3 fluorophore at the 3\u2032 end of one of the oligomers of the duplex, in close proximity to a BHQ2 quencher at the 5\u2032 end of the other oligomer. When the two oligomers are in very close proximity (i.e., when the two oligomers are annealed), then the Cy3 fluorescence is strongly quenched by the FRET effect. After the duplex has been unwound by the SCV helicase, then the Cy3 fluorescence is no longer quenched, and a dramatic increase in the fluorescence may be observed. To ensure that the primers do not reanneal, a second capture primer is included in the reaction. This is identical to the BHQ2 primer but does not contain the BHQ2 quenching group, therefore the annealing process has little effect on the fluorescence of Cy3. We optimized reaction conditions to ensure that all measurements were carried out in the linear region (Figure S2). As a one minute time-point was in the linear region, we then probed the effect of the presence of various concentrations of the bananin inhibitors and compared them to control reactions where no inhibitor was added (Figure 4B). Additional controls were carried out to verify that the bananin compounds did not fluoresce themselves at the wavelength at which we were reading. Data from these experiments were fitted to the logistic equation to obtain the helicaseIC50 values (Figure 4C). Although the overall helicaseIC50 values appeared slightly weaker (i.e,. larger) than the ATPaseIC50 values, it was observed that the inhibitors followed the same general trends as those observed for the ATPase data. Bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin were effective inhibitors of helicase activity, while ansabanin and adeninobananin barely inhibit the reaction.",

The infectivity of the virus in the cultures in the presence and absence of bananin was measured by a standard TCID50 protocol using serial dilution of the cell culture supernatant [36], and compared to virus controls where no drug was added. Briefly, cell culture supernatant at various time points after infection was serially diluted and fresh FRhK-4 cells were infected with the serial dilutions. Cytopathic effects were observed three days after infection with the serial dilutions, thereby allowing measurement of the viral titre. In this study, drugs were added either one hour before or one hour after the infection with a 0.03 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the virus. In FRhK cells, the generation time of the SCV replication has been shown to be 17\u201319 hr (our unpublished data). Therefore, the readings at 24 hr are effectively after a single generation. It can be seen from this data that at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM bananin, the viral titre was reduced by almost 50% after 24 hr (Figure 5), and the drug was most effective when added one hour after infection compared to one hour before. When drug was added before, it was not removed on addition of the virus and was present for the rest of the experiment. After 48 hr, the difference between addition of drug before and after infection became more pronounced, and the viral titre had dropped below 35% of the control in the absence of inhibitor (Figure 5). At a concentration of 50 \u03bcM, these effects were more pronounced; when the drug was added one hour after infection, the viral titre was below 10% of an untreated control infection after 24 hr. At 100 \u03bcM bananin, the viral titre was almost zero after 24 hr and 48 hr. These results suggest first that bananin is an effective inhibitor with an EC50 of below 10 \u00b5M (when measured 48 hr post-infection and when drug was added one hour after virus infection). Second, due to the increased efficacy of the drug when added post infection, these results suggest that bananin does not inhibit the entry step, but inhibits a later step of the infection cycle after the virus has penetrated the cell.",

Bananin was maintained at the same concentration throughout the experiment. The kinetics of infection were examined by making Q-RT-PCR measurements 1 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr post-infection. Up to 6 hr post infection, there was little difference in SCV S-gene levels between the control and in the cultures containing bananin, even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM (Figure 6). However, after 12 hr, it was clearly observed that the drug was having an inhibitory effect, even at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, and this effect increased with time up to 48 hr. This data also indicated that adding the drug after viral infection was considerably more effective than when it was added before (Figure 5).",

We have developed an extremely convenient and quick method for testing both ATPase activities colorimetrically, and helicase activities fluorimetrically through a type of FRET assay. This combination of assays may be adapted easily for high-throughput screening of compound libraries against both NTPase and DNA-unwinding enzymatic activities, and avoids the use of radioactive 32P, which is commonly used in many traditional helicase assays.",

Bananin acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both ATP and nucleic acid, suggesting this class of inhibitors binds at a site distinct from the ATP and nucleic acid binding sites. Far weaker inhibition of the unstimulated ATPase activity was observed, showing that bananin does not act as a nonspecific aggregator. The ATPase inhibition results were consistent with those from the helicase assays: bananin, vanillinbananin, eubananin, and iodobananin were the best inhibitors of DNA-unwinding, while ansabanin and adeninobananin were poor inhibitors. Generally, the helicase inhibition activities measured for each compound, as determined by IC50 values, were less than the corresponding ATPase inhibition activities, but the trends remained consistent. This appears to be a characteristic common to many helicase inhibitors [24, 25].",

Bananin exhibited antiviral effects at concentrations significantly below those causing cell toxicity (EC50 < 10 \u03bcM, CC50 = 390 \u03bcM). Experiments measuring the viral titer in two different situations, one where the drug was added one hour before viral infection, and one where the drug was added one hour after viral infection, suggested that bananin did not inhibit viral entry but inhibited some key intracellular processes involved in viral replication or pathogenesis. These experiments were further confirmed by kinetic experiments measuring the relative quantity of viral RNA compared to cellular RNA over 48 hr. The drug had little effect on RNA levels during the early stages of the life cycle (approximately 0\u20136 hr post infection), indicating that the amount of the virus which has entered the cells was similar in the presence or absence of the drug. But the viral RNA levels were very different during the later stages (from approximately 12\u201348 hr), suggesting that viral transcription/replication was inhibited by bananin. It is interesting to note the marked reduction in efficacy when bananin is added prior to viral infection, despite its continued presence post infection. First, this would suggest that the compound does not inhibit a viral entry process. Second, it suggests that bananin may be affecting other cellular pathways that in the absence of viral infection may resist the protective effects of the drug. The SCV helicase is one possible target within the cell, although at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that bananin may be inhibiting via other pathway(s).",

Testing a number of bananin derivatives, we have shown that it is important to reduce steric hindrance around the pyridoxal ring for effective inhibition of the SCV helicase. Furthermore, bananin was shown to be an effective antiviral drug in a cell culture of the virus. The mode of viral inhibition supports the hypothesis that the SCV helicase is a target of these compounds.

Viral reproduction in the infected cells was quantified by virus titration, as described below.",

Following incubation for 24 and 48 hr, viable SCV production was measured by back titration of the culture media supernatant using a TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) protocol [36]. Briefly, the supernatant was serially 10-fold diluted with fresh cell culture media (MEM) and inoculated into FRhK-4 cells in 96-well plates. The virus titre was determined by observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) in FRhK-4 cells after 3 days of culture [36, 38].",

Reverse-transcription was performed using random hexamers with the ThermoScript RT system (Invitrogene, CA). Intracellular viral RNA was quantified using quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) [36, 38, 39], using the forward primer 5\u2032-GCT TAG GCC CTT TGA GAG AGA CA-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-GCC AAT GCC AGT AGT GGT GTA AA-3\u2032 (final concentration 200 nM), the fluorescent probe 5\u2032-CCT GAT GGC AAA CCT TGC AC-3\u2032 and phosphate probe 5\u2032-(LC640)CAC CTG CTC TTA ATT GTT ATT GGC C-3\u2032 (final concentration 800 nM). The real-time quantification was carried out using LC Faststart DNA Master Hyb Probes and LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, USA). PCR conditions employed were 95\u00b0C for 10 min and then 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 5 s, 72\u00b0C for 5 s and 40\u00b0C for 30 s. The increase in PCR products was monitored for each amplification cycle by measuring the increase in fluorescence caused by the binding of SYBR Green I to double-stranded DNA. The crossing point values were determined for each sample and specificity of the amplicons was measured by melting curve analysis and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. A ten-fold serial dilution of plasmid ranging from 1.5 pg/ml to 1.5 \u00d7 106 pg/ml were used as standard and the gene \u03b2-actin was used as an endogenous control to normalize for intersample variations in the amount of total RNA.",
