Several authors have noted problems with the ability of previous NRC (1989) standards to predict growth of dairy heifers (Waldo et al., 1997; Davis and Drackley, 1998; Diaz et al., 2001). In particular, protein requirements stated for milk-fed calves (NRC, 1989) did not agree with experimental evidence or with specifications derived from other nutrient-requirement systems (Davis and Drackley, 1998).",

            "text": "Except for the comprehensive study by Donnelly and Hutton (1976a,b), effects of dietary protein supply in preruminant dairy calves have largely been evaluated by changes in BW gain, which is an imprecise, inaccurate, and often biased predictor of lean body mass (Owens et al., 1993). Increases in BW gain do not necessarily reflect increases in lean tissue deposition because of potential differences in fat deposition and in weights of gut fill and gut tissue mass (Stobo et al., 1966). Increased protein intake in milk-based diets may increase lean tissue deposition and decrease fat deposition (Donnelly and Hutton, 1976b). Diaz et al. (2001) reported that calves fed amounts of protein similar to those fed by Donnelly and Hutton (1976b) gained more protein and less fat than calves in the earlier study. Some evidence indicates that continued selection for milk production has resulted in dairy cattle that are leaner than those of 20 to 30 yr ago (Murphy et al., 1991; Waldo et al., 1997), perhaps due to larger mature size (Waldo et al., 1997) or increases in somatotropin secretion (Brown et al., 1989). Our objective, therefore, was to quantify the relationships between protein content of milk replacers and growth, body composition, and nutrient utilization in preruminant Holstein calves.",

The experiment was designed to include eight calves in an initial (baseline) slaughter group and eight calves on each of four experimental treatments (i.e., 40 calves total) distributed over two replicates of 20 calves. In anticipation of a higher than normal death loss for shipped-in calves, 50 male Holstein calves, < 1 wk old, were purchased from a sale barn in two separate groups (i.e., replicates). The second group of 26 calves was purchased and used after completion of the first group of 24 calves. The calves were on experiment for an 8-wk period, which consisted of a 2-wk standardization period and a 6-wk experimental period. The experiment was conducted from July through November of 1997.",

The milk replacer was reconstituted to 12.5% solids and fed at 10% of BW daily in two equal feedings at 0800 and 1700. The second group of calves began on this same schedule, but because of excessive diarrhea, on d 8, calves were switched to whole milk (10% of BW divided into two equal feedings) for the rest of the standardization period. Diarrhea seemed to lessen after this switch was made; reasons for improvement are unknown but could include different protein sources (casein vs. whey proteins), higher digestibility, or bioactive factors present in whole milk but not in milk replacer. Although the different standardization diets between the two groups of calves might be a confounding factor for experimental treatments, body composition of the calves slaughtered at the start of the experimental period was similar between the two groups of calves and the interaction of replicate and diet composition was significant for very few variables (see Results and Discussion). Calves had free access to fresh water at all times, but no access to hay or starter at any time during the experiment. All calves remained in individual calf hutches throughout the standardization period.",

Because composition of isocaloric diets by necessity is confounded by the decreasing amounts of fat and lactose as CP increased, a more accurate description of the diets is that the ratio of protein:nonprotein energy sources increased linearly at a constant energy density. Previous studies using lambs (Jagusch et al., 1970; Norton et al., 1970) and calves (Gerrits et al., 1996) have established that increasing CP content, and the corresponding increases of the protein:energy ratio, have marked effects on growth and body composition of milk-fed preruminants. This principle held true for calves fed isocaloric diets with increasing protein:energy ratios (Donnelly and Hutton, 1976a,b) as well as for older calves fed increasing amounts of protein with fixed amounts of non-protein energy sources (Gerrits et al., 1996); the latter situation resulted in confounding because of greater ME intake by calves as protein supply was increased. Statistical interpretation of data from our study would not change if regression analyses were performed using the increasing CP:energy ratio rather than the CP content; consequently, our results are presented as a function of increasing dietary CP content for simplicity and ease of interpretation in the field.",

The gain:feed ratios for calves fed milk replacer containing 25.8% CP were similar to the highest values reported by Diaz et al. (2001) for calves fed a 30% CP milk replacer in amounts to allow ADG of about 1 kg/d. Increases in gain:feed have been clearly demonstrated in response to increased rates of milk replacer feeding that allow greater ADG (Khouri and Pickering, 1968; Diaz et al., 2001). The higher values obtained in our study also are comparable to gain:feed ratios reported for the young of other species that consume milk ad libitum, including lambs (Hodge, 1974; Greenwood et al., 1998) and pigs (Hodge, 1974; Kim et al., 2001). Improvement of gain:feed in animals fed for ad libitum intakes relative to animals fed at restricted intakes is attributed to a dilution of maintenance expenditures. It is noteworthy, however, that gain:feed varied from 0.51 to 0.78 in our calves fed at the same restricted percentage of BW, with the only difference being diet composition (i.e., increasing CP content and CP:energy, and decreasing lactose and fat contents at similar ME concentrations).",

During the experimental period, increases in body weight of calves were greater as dietary CP increased. During wk 3 and 4, calves were placed into metabolism stalls and rates of gain slowed. Because DMI did not change during this time, lower rates of gain indicate decreases in efficiency of gain. Decreased gain:feed evidently resulted from the changes in housing and environment when calves were confined in the metabolism stalls. Rates of gain increased again during wk 5 and 6 when calves were returned to hutches. Whether these changes in ADG due to housing affected composition of gain during those times cannot be determined from our data. Because calves on all dietary treatments went through the changes of housing together, we assume that impacts on body composition and nutrient utilization were uniform across dietary treatments and are discussed accordingly.",

This value was adopted by the NRC in its most recent revision of Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle (NRC, 2001). If this value is applied to our measured N retention values, calves would be predicted to gain 0.23, 0.27, 0.40, and 0.47 kg/d when fed milk replacers containing 16.1, 18.5, 22.9, and 25.8% CP, respectively. Actual ADG during wk 3 to 4 when N balance data were collected were 0.15, 0.23, 0.35, and 0.38 kg/d, respectively. Therefore, ADG predicted by N retention overestimated actual ADG in agreement with others (Gerrits et al., 1996; Diaz et al., 2001). Possible sources of error in N balance studies include losses of N in scurf that is not measured, incomplete collection of feces or urine due to splashing or evaporation, and losses of volatile N compounds in feces during oven drying. The amount of N retained per kilogram of actual ADG, based on our measured N retention and BW gains, would be 19.7, 25.3, 26.8, and 24.4 g of N/kg ADG.",

The BV was not affected significantly (P = 0.26) by treatment, although means trended downward as dietary CP increased. By definition, BV refers to the efficiency of use of absorbed protein for growth above maintenance; therefore, there were no significant differences among diets in how efficiently the calves utilized N for growth. However, gross efficiency of N use by calves (i.e., N retained as a proportion of N intake) increased as dietary CP increased, probably because of the stimulation of greater growth rates as dietary CP increased.

We are aware of no studies other than that of Donnelly and Hutton (1976a) in which BV has been measured over a range of dietary CP contents in preruminant calves. In that experiment, milk replacers based on dried skim milk were fed; CP content ranged from 15.7 to 31.5%. The BV were calculated by the same methodology used in our study and decreased from 83% for the 15.7% CP diet to 56% for the 31.5% CP diet. Babella et al. (1988) calculated the true BV for a milk replacer (28% CP) based entirely on whey proteins to be 66.2%, similar to the BV for our highest CP diet (67.3%). Terosky et al. (1997) reported a value for \u201capparent biological value\u201d of 73.7% for a milk replacer (20.7% CP) based entirely on whey proteins (whey and whey protein concentrate). Diaz et al. (2001) reported that the \u201cbiological value of absorbed protein\u201d ranged from 57.0 to 70.0% for a milk replacer (30% CP) fed at different DMI. However, in both of these latter studies (Terosky et al., 1997; Diaz et al., 2001), values were calculated as retained N divided by N apparently absorbed and were not corrected for estimated endogenous N and metabolic fecal N. Consequently, their values are comparable to our values for N retained as a percentage of N absorbed. Correction of those values for endogenous urinary N and metabolic fecal N would increase means to greater than 80% in both studies. Slightly lower values in our study may coincide with the decreased gain:feed observed during the time calves were housed in metabolism stalls (Figure 1). We conclude, therefore, that the NRC (2001) value of 80% for BV is a reasonable estimate, but that additional research should investigate factors that impact BV in calves fed whey protein-containing milk replacers.",

Those values were obtained from studies in which whole milk or skim milk-based milk replacers were fed to calves (Davis and Drackley, 1998). Calculations from data reported by Diaz et al. (2001) indicate that DE was 95.0% of gross energy and ME was 91.9% of gross energy in milk replacers based on whey proteins.

In contrast, contents of fat, ash, and energy decreased linearly as dietary CP increased. Although means for baseline calves were not compared statistically with calves fed experimental treatments, VFC for calves fed the lowest CP milk replacer contained substantially more fat and energy, and less water, than baseline calves. Increasing dietary CP resulted in VFC composition becoming closer to that of baseline calves.

            "text": "Together, therefore, our data indicate that calves contained greater amounts of lean tissue and less fat in the final VFC (and, by inference from limited data in Table 8, the whole body) as dietary CP content increased. Likewise, the content of fat in VFC gain decreased and lean components increased. Our results indicate that diet composition, specifically the CP content or perhaps the ratio of protein:nonprotein energy sources (lactose and fat), can markedly impact body composition and composition of gain in young milk-fed calves, even when total energy deposition does not differ. Increasing protein intake seems to cause a repartitioning of energy deposition from fat to protein. Similar results have been shown previously for calves (Donnelly and Hutton, 1976b; Gerrits et al., 1996), lambs (Jagusch et al., 1970; Norton et al., 1970), and pigs (Caperna et al., 1991; Cameron et al., 1999). Equations derived in our experiment to describe responses of body composition and gain components to increasing dietary CP percentage were, in general, similar to those reported by Donnelly and Hutton (1976b).",

At the mean BW of calves across treatments during the balance study (55 kg; Table 4), ME requirements for maintenance (0.100 Mcal/kg of BW0.75; NRC, 2001) would be 2.02 Mcal. Total ME intake during the balance study averaged 3.60 Mcal/d. Because intake and BW data obtained during the balance study approximate means for the entire 42-d experiment, they can be used to estimate the efficiency of ME use for body energy retention. Using means across dietary treatments for energy gains in VFC (Table 7) and estimates for visceral tissues derived from the incomplete data in Table 8, whole body energy gain was approximately 0.92 Mcal/d. The ME available for tissue deposition was 1.58 Mcal/d (i.e., 3.60 minus 2.02); consequently, efficiency of ME use for tissue energy retention was 0.58 (i.e., 0.92/1.58). This estimate is lower than the value of 0.69 assigned by NRC (2001) but is similar to estimates for calves of this size made from more recent data sets (Bartlett, 2001; Diaz et al., 2001; Tikofsky et al., 2001) and for milk-fed calves from 80 to 240 kg of BW (Gerrits et al., 1996). Maintenance requirements specified by NRC (2001) are lower than earlier estimates (e.g., Roy, 1980); if maintenance is underestimated the apparent efficiency of ME use for growth also would be underestimated.",

Although, as discussed earlier, balance trials overestimate N deposition as protein (e.g., Gerrits et al., 1996; Diaz et al., 2001), this ratio is close to the percentage of live BW represented by VFC (73.2%; Table 6). Assuming that the visceral tissues accrete protein proportionally to VFC, as suggested by data in Table 8 and as shown in our more recent studies (Bartlett, 2001), the rate of whole body protein deposition (i.e., VFC plus viscera) would be closer to, but still lower than, that predicted by the N balance determination.

Using equations in NRC (2001), calves at the start of the study (45 kg of BW) fed reconstituted milk replacer (4.56 Mcal of ME/kg of DM) at 12% of BW would have an energy-allowable growth rate of about 0.48 kg/d. The NRC (2001) predicts a requirement for apparently digestible protein (ADP) of 141 g to meet that rate of gain, which would be equivalent to 152 g/d of CP from milk proteins (NRC, 2001). This amount of CP would necessitate a milk replacer containing 22.5% CP on a DM basis to match ADP and ME requirements. Consequently, calves fed milk replacers containing 16.1 or 18.5% CP consumed insufficient protein and deposited greater amounts of dietary energy as fat.",

Calves actually consumed 105, 123, 159, and 186 g of digestible CP on average; therefore, the NRC (2001) equation seemed to overpredict ADP requirements at lower dietary CP contents and underpredict them at the highest CP content. Despite the fact that predicted supply of ADP at the start of the study should have been adequate for maximal growth in calves fed milk replacers containing either 22.9 or 25.8% CP according to NRC (2001) assumptions, ADG, gain:feed, N retention, and protein deposition in VFC increased linearly, and fat content of VFC and visceral tissues decreased linearly over this range of dietary CP contents. Our results suggest either 1) that assumptions inherent in the NRC (2001) equations are not correct for calves under these circumstances, or 2) that additional CP stimulates protein deposition in some fashion beyond just provision of AA for protein synthesis.",

(1998) showed that increasing digestible CP intake, but not increased protein-free energy intake, stimulated increased concentrations of IGF-1 in plasma of preruminant calves between 80 and 240 kg of BW. Likewise, our own recent evidence (Bartlett, 2001) showed that IGF-1 increased, as did lean tissue growth, in response to increased dietary CP content at the same ME intake in calves similar to those in the present study. Direct evidence for increased IGF-1 synthesis and increased skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to increased AA supply (via abomasal casein infusion) at constant energy intake also has been reported in older steers (Maloney et al., 1998). Increases in circulating IGF-I in response to increased protein or AA intake are believed to result from increased transcription of IGF-I messenger RNA in liver, as demonstrated in sheep by Pell et al. (1993).",

Increased average daily gains were shown to reflect increases in structural tissues and lean tissue deposition, not additional fat deposition. As growth rate increased, calves also grew larger more efficiently and retained a greater proportion of ingested protein at the same metabolizable energy intake. Our results indicate that manipulating milk replacer composition can markedly alter the characteristics of body growth in young dairy calves. Linear increases of lean tissue deposition with increasing dietary crude protein are not well predicted by current (NRC, 2001) guidelines. Our data on digestion and utilization of milk-based diets will allow further refinements in equations to predict growth and nutrient requirements of preruminant calves.",
