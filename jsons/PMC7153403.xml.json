The general aim of surveillance is to help develop policy, guide mission priorities, and provide assurance of the prevention and control of disease. In recent years, as concerns about consequences of a catastrophic biological attack or emerging infectious diseases grew, the term bio surveillance became more common in relation to an array of threats to our national security. Bio surveillance is concerned with two things: (1) reducing, as much as possible, the time it takes to recognize and characterize biological events with potentially catastrophic consequences and (2) providing situational awareness\u2014that is, information that signals an event might be occurring, information about what those signals mean, and information about how events will likely unfold in the near future (GAO 2011: 9).\n",

The definition also underscores the ongoing multiple challenges in improving bio- surveillance capabilities and their utility in the national security context. Three key challenges in particular remain for improving national bio- surveillance capabilities and they are: methodological, information sharing and integration issues. The information sharing and integration issues have already been discussed in Chapter 10.1057/978-1-137-51700-5_6 so this section will focus on the bio- surveillance methodology issues. By methodological issues, I am referring to both the technical methods (biosensors) and the broader different disciplinary approaches to bio- surveillance that now inform debates amongst stakeholders on how to improve bio- surveillance capabilities.",

            "text": "From a technical perspective, there has been a range of bio-sensor research from inside and outside the IC to detect the release of dangerous pathogens into the environment. Perhaps the most well-known of these initiatives\u2014 Biowatch was developed by DHS in 2003 with the aim to detect aerolised bio attacks for high risk bioagents in major US cities. The program however, has had mixed success relating to the reliability of results and the delay in the publication of these once samples were collected from the field (GAO 2016, 2017). The DHS tried to speed up the detection times from the first generation manual systems to Gen 3 acquisitions, which promised speedier autonomous systems though testing difficulties remained. Further analysis, however, of alternatives by the DHS as showing any advantages of an autonomous system over the current manual system were insufficient to justify the cost of a fully technology switch (GAO 2016: 7). In the US, research continues to improve the robustness, sensitivity, specificity, timeliness and cost of biosensor equipment. While conventional PCR based methods and immunoassay are still being used other biochemical, microbiological and genetic solutions are being trialled such as the incorporation of antibodies and peptide molecules, which may greatly reduce detection times to minutes instead of several hours (Kim et al. 2015). Leaving aside efforts to improve aerolised biosensors, the expected rapid growth of synthetic biology and biotechnology and the potential (however unknown) that bioengineered material may be used maliciously in a way that threatens public safety or national security may shift the focus into other scientific research that can detect signals of bio-engineering including types of changes, location and possibly in the future where changes were made. In July 2017, IARPA commissioned a new program\u2014Finding Engineering Linked Indicators (FELIX) to meet such objectives. IARPA is seeking interest from a range of scientists (synthetic biologists, micro biologist, immunologist, statisticians and computer scientists) to carry out 3\u20135 research projects addressing the two main focus points of FELIX (Eaves 2017). If this research can produce reliable results, it will provide another useful collection and analysis point for the IC by allowing the detection of previously undetectable signatures of bio-engineered material in bio-criminal and terrorism cases.",

            "text": "In addition to the various technical innovations in biosensors, a range of other bio- surveillance methods have been deployed. In the late 1990s, the US CDC pioneered syndromic surveillance systems, which were initially aimed at improving the early warning of infectious diseases and bio-terrorism and have now evolved to include situational awareness (Buehler et al. 2004). Similar syndromic surveillance systems have developed in other \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries such as the UK\u2019s Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance Team (ReSST), which collects four national syndromic surveillance systems from several sources. Additionally and more recently, the Robert Koch Institute is creating an early warning system based on machine learning and natural language processing that will include \u2018appealing\u2019 interactive web applications and be linked to the German electronic reporting and information system DEMIS (Robert Koch Institute 2018). Syndromic surveillance systems are a critical adjunct to traditional public health lab surveillance as they strive to provide real time or near real time collection, analysis and dissemination of health data to enable early identification and management of public health threats as they are not based on lab confirmed diagnoses\u2014and assess a wider set of health related data including: clinical signs, absenteeism, pharmacy sales or animal health production collapse (Buehler et al. 2004). A clear benefit of syndromic surveillance is it can be cheaper, faster and potentially more transparent then a state\u2019s public health lab surveillance system. However, as with the use of big volumes of data more broadly in the IC, data quantity, quality and structural variation all impact on the utility, accuracy and timeliness of some rapid epidemic intelligence from internet based surveillance methods (Yan et al. 2017).",

Several event based internet surveillance systems have grown in number in the last decade. Using PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar data bases, O\u2019Shea\u2019s study found 50 based internet systems all using different technology and data sources to gather data, process and disseminate it to detect infectious disease outbreaks (O\u2019Shea 2017). In line with the broader IC development of exploiting social media analytics discussed in Chapter 10.1057/978-1-137-51700-5_4, in 2013 DHS piloted another approach to bio- surveillance. The pilot involved DHS trialling various social media analytics from self-reported information on Facebook and twitter to determine pandemics and acts of terrorism given social media feeds can provide close to real time reporting of symptoms, sickness access to hospital or pharmaceuticals (Insinna 2013).",

Can for example, a national bio- surveillance system informed by one or more methods discussed above predict the emergence of the next pandemic or outbreak, particularly novel new viruses? Some scientists argue that the prediction of a micro-evolutionary process of some biological agents such as a virus (i.e. a short term emergence or cross species transition) is incredibly difficult given evolutionary and epidemiological timescales are fundamentally different. Geoghegan and Holmes argue that instead it would be better to build surveillance capability that \u2018assesses the fault line of disease emergence at the human-animal interface, particularly those shaped by ecological disturbances\u2019 (2017: 7).",

In particular, researchers working on the Global Virome Project believe that prediction of which viruses might spill over from animal to human health is possible. Geoghegan and Holmes in response argue focusing on disease hotspots relies on very small amounts of data that can be unreliable given they are rare events. They give the example of Saudi Arabia which has not classically been a hotspot, yet MERS recently jumped into humans from camels there. Sequencing these viruses may provide useful evolutionary information, but Geoghegan and Holmes argue it won\u2019t necessarily provide early warning of what is going to affect us (Geoghegan and Holmes 2017).",

Gene drives are artificial \u2018selfish\u2019 genes that can force itself into 99% of an organism\u2019s offspring instead of the usual 50%. Currently there is a global research effort funded by the Gates Foundation to cause female mosquitoes to become sterile within 11 generations or 1 year.

On what metrics can an \u2018effective bio- surveillance\u2019 system be evaluated given the multiple methodological approaches and systems that have developed for bio- surveillance? Clinician and public health security specialist Jim Wilson has argued that the development of an effective global surveillance and response system is probably at least a decade or more away (Wilson 2017: 222). In the interim, we are left with multiple approaches of varying validity and reliability. So based on the current fragmented bio- surveillance efforts how do we learn the lessons that need to be learnt that will enable the implementation of the long awaited national bio- surveillance capabilities? How do we know if progress is being made to that goal? Importantly, beyond national efforts, how do we assess the current capability of state, local agencies to contribute to a national bio- surveillance capabilities? Where are the gaps and vulnerabilities in the current sub-national bio- surveillance and detection systems? (GAO 2011). Compounding the current challenge of evaluating bio- surveillance capabilities in order to construct a viable national approach is that different bio- surveillance systems have been created for different end users (e.g. animal and human). The Blue Ribbon Project report into animal health detailed information sharing challenges in animal health bio- surveillance and its integration with other bio- surveillance data including in human health (Blue Ribbon Report 2017: 25). This lack of integration makes it difficult to assess how information collected for animal or agricultural bio- surveillance could improve national approaches to bio- surveillance, particularly in scenarios where the emergence of disease could be an intentional or a malevolent act.",

Gaps and impediments in global bio- surveillance have become increasingly evident to the world in the wake of the largest Ebola epidemic ever\u2014in which these challenges impacted the ability to prevent, detect, and respond. Under the looming threat of MERS-CoV, leishmaniasis, influenza, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and plague, the global public health community now realizes the urgent need to address shortcomings in global bio- surveillance and the broader public health security system. Properly preparing for the next major outbreak hinges on our willingness to transform global health surveillance systems and those of countries with fragile health infrastructures (Shaikh et al. 2015: 183\u2013186). In some respects, similar challenges in developing national bio- surveillance capabilities exist in those at the global level including: siloed systems, inadequate training and technical expertise, different information and communication technology (ICT) standards, concerns over data sharing and confidentiality, poor interoperability, and inadequate analytical approaches and tools.",

A fully integrated approach to bio- surveillance may rely on more than one method or capability which together can provide reliable and valid bio- surveillance data and early warning at the national and global level. It may mean investigating ways that older legacy systems can be integrated or at least made interoperable with newer more mobile platforms such as mobile or wireless health technologies particularly in the developing world (Shaikh et al. 2015). It should be clear by now that improving bio- surveillance capabilities is essential to improving the prevention of natural and suspicious outbreaks of disease. It is important for the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence and law enforcement communities to understand broadly the theoretical and practical developments in bio- surveillance so that they are able to more effectively lever relevant knowledge on bio-threats and risks.",

The Ebola epidemic (2014\u20132015) was a recent reminder of the consequences of weak public health capability and infrastructure in failing to prevent, identify and respond quickly to infectious disease. The Ebola epidemic also had a catalytic effect on many public health authorities, practitioners and researcher\u2019s views about the capability of the traditional UN response to global health crisis mainly coordinated through the WHO. Many public health watchers are now arguing the need for a broader more effective focus\u2014not just on prevention and response to infectious disease, but one that also included reframing the focus as a human security issue. Adherents to this view make a compelling point when seen through the Ebola case that continues to have significant impact on the economic and social stability of countries impacted (Sparrow 2016; Marston   et al. 2017; WHO 2015; MMWR 2016). Beyond West Africa, similar vulnerabilities in capabilities such as diseases surveillance, detection, contract tracing, clinical care, community engagement and communications exist globally as was also seen with the proliferation of Zika in Latin American/Caribbean and MERs in the Middle East. In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future that met after the Ebola crisis estimated 4.5 billion per year investment would be needed for better detection and response tools. The same Commission report also estimated that the economic cost for global pandemics per year was $60 billion (Schnirring 2016; Dzau and Sands 2016).",

For example, a country can \u2018tick yes\u2019 for having a national public health legislation, but other dependent legislation ( biosecurity, food safety, environmental health) may not be in place\u2014thereby reducing overall the country\u2019s ability to manage health crisis or for the global community to understand and respond to capability and information gaps in that country (ibid.).

In 2001, there was an attempt by some member states to introduce a verification process, but this was vetoed by the US following inspection of Soviet sites under the Tripartite agreement between the Soviet Union, USA and the UK. The US arguing it could be difficult to certify that a state\u2019s biological program was merely defensive rather than offensive. The US also had concerns that inspection to labs could be disruptive or provide opportunity for industrial espionage against legitimately operating biotechnology companies (Gerstein 2013: 137). Historically there has been a mixed record by some \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence countries in assessing verification and therefore noncompliance of the BWC. Koblentz surveyed the role of intelligence (particularly HUMINT) in assessing the former Soviet Union\u2019s offensive bio-weapons program between 1971 and 1990 which resulted in an incomplete picture of Moscow\u2019s program (Koblentz 2009: 157). Additionally, as discussed in Chapter 10.1057/978-1-137-51700-5_2, in 2002 several \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence communities (US, UK and Australia) incorrectly assessed that Iraq had a mobile offensive bio-weapon capability.

How they precisely undertake measures is at the discretion of individual state parties. The BWC has been criticised for several reasons over the years. Some of this is warranted, while other criticisms seem to not take into account that the BWC is different from its chemical and nuclear counter proliferation counterparts. As Gerstein argues, \u2018material is the centre of gravity for nuclear discussions and intent being the center of gravity for biological issues\u2019 (Gerstein 2013: 176).

Historically there has also been a low number of party states submitting their annual confidence building measures. Although the BWC ISU was able to report that a record number (81) annual confidence building measures were submitted in 2016, this only represented 45.5% of all 179 state parties submitting that year.

The Australia Group 41 member countries have collaborated on the development of lists of technologies and materials that could be used in the development of chemical and biological weapons. Member countries then commit to monitor the export or transfer of these materials. The Australia Group maintains common control lists for dual use bio-equipment, technology, software, bio agents and plant and animal pathogens as the basis for promoting common standards and regulations ( Australia Group Common Control List Handbook 2015).

In some respects the GHSA provides a bridge between traditional, narrow security approaches to biological weapons and a wider securitisation of global health. The GHSA was established in 2014 by the Obama Administration and is a multi-sectoral approach to global health security seeking to include governments, international organisations and non-government organisations. GHSA was set up in part to \u2018advance further the IHR implementation through focused activities to strengthen core capacities and to ensure a world safe and secure from global health threats posed by infectious disease; where we can prevent or mitigate the impact of naturally occurring outbreak and intentional or accidental releases of dangerous pathogens\u2019 (Heymann et al. 2015: 1889). GHSA is a refreshing approach not only because it seeks to establish a global framework and capacity to assess, measure and sustain advances in global preparedness for epidemic threats, but it also addresses biosecurity as a public health priority\u2014thereby linking public health and health security, development, defense and agricultural sector (Cameron 2017). The underlining logic of GHSA suggests that the same attributes needed to prevent, detect and respond to deliberate use of a bio agent are those required to manage a natural or accidental outbreak of a biological agent. GHSA also includes 12 technical targets aligned to three areas: prevention, detection and response (Heymann et al. 2015: 1889). Like earlier initiatives, such as the US sponsored Global Health Initiative (GHI), which was discontinued by the Obama Administration in 2012 due a lack of financial and technical authority to leverage and coordinate multiple US agencies\u2014the GHSA will need to secure ongoing funding beyond 2019 from major donors including the US. At a November 2017 GHSA ministerial meeting in Uganda, assembled governments signed onto an extension of the GHSA for another five years. US Secretary Tillerson had issued public support for continuing it, but at the time of writing no commitment by the US for future financial support (beyond FY 2019) has been made. GHSA holds promise, but in addition to ongoing funding challenges, those member states signed up to it will need to ensure effective governance is in place to align funding to global health priorities articulated by the WHO, World Bank, IMF and other donors in order to avoid duplication and promote an effective approach to international health security capabilities (Paranjape and Franz 2015; Schnirring 2017).",

More trusting and formalised contact between both global health security stakeholders and those working in the security and intelligence communities can only be mutually beneficial to preventing major bio-threats and risks.",

In all \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries there has historically been in place biosafety risk management procedures and practices to prevent accidental infection, accidental release, or intentional misuse of biological substances. However, as noted in Chapter 10.1057/978-1-137-51700-5_2 in the last two decades the expansion in synthetic biology, biotechnology and biological science research has meant there are now more people working in more locations on dangerous pathogens\u2014not just in well-regulated liberal democracies such as those in the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries, but also in developing countries; where biosafety and biosecurity capabilities and practice may be less established such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and former Soviet states (Gronvall et al. 2016; Shinwari et al. 2014).

In June 2014, dozens of workers in CDC could have been potentially exposed to live anthrax that hadn\u2019t been killed before being shipped from CDC\u2019s Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) BSL 3 to a BSL 2 lab in its Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch. CDC investigations determined that at least 67 CDC staff members may have been exposed to viable anthrax cells or spores though no illness or deaths occurred (CDC 2014). The same report found several breaches of biosafety process and procedure including failures of policy, training, supervision, judgement and even scientific knowledge (ibid.). Similarly, biosafety lapses cases involving CDC labs occurred in January 2014 when an unintentional cross contamination strain of low pathogenic avian influenza A (H9N2) with a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1 ) was shipped from CDC to the USDA (Schnirring 2014). Further biosafety breaches were detected in July 2014\u2014this time at the National Institute of Health campus in Bethesda Maryland; where 6 viable smallpox vials were discovered improperly stored (Dennis and Sun 2014a). An additional five improperly stored vials were also found at the NIH\u2014three were select agents (Burkholderia pseudmomallei, Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis) (Dennis and Sun 2014b). In the NIH cases despite their age, they were still viable organisms which could have caused illness. Their theft could have also posed a bio-threat and risk to the community.",

Lapses in biosafety arrangements demonstrate, at least in some cases, biosecurity vulnerabilities that could make the theft or even infiltration of a threat actor into high containment lab easier. Thefts from labs have occurred in the past by an insider, and a motivated insider can compromise biosafety for a range of reasons. Bunn and Sagan\u2019s edited book Insider Threats provides a useful taxonomy for thinking about \u2018 insider threats\u2019 (Bunn and Sagan 2016). They can be: self-motivated insiders, who at some point decide to become a spy or thief. Insiders can also be recruited insiders, who are already inside an organisation, but become convinced to become part of a plot. Finally, an infiltrated insider might be associated with some adversary of the organisation and join it with the purpose of carrying out a malicious act against it. Bunn and Sagan also refer to inadvertent or non-malicious actors, who pose a threat by making mistakes without really intending to do so\u2014such as leaving a password lying around. Finally, the authors refer to a \u2018coerced insider\u2019, who remains loyal in intent, but knowingly assists in theft or sabotage to prevent hostile acts against themselves or their loved ones (ibid.: 4).",

A culture of accountability at all levels must also exist if effective risk management can prevent, identify and treat bio-threats and risks promptly. A rogue insider threat, who may have been assessed as appropriate to work with select agents and seems initially to follow all the relevant biosafety regulations and procedures could still pose a risk if they have not embraced the organisation\u2019s normative cultural biosafety values.

Disruption is not a new concept in criminology and law enforcement practice, though it can be difficult to define in all law enforcement contexts (Ratcliffe 2008: 204). Its meaning at least in the criminology/policing/law enforcement contexts can partly be traced back to broader desires\u2014initially by UK law enforcement followed later by other \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s to move law enforcement away from its traditional reactive mode to offending to one driven by intelligence. This concept of law enforcement or policing being intelligence driven or led gained significant traction in the criminology and policing literature (Walsh 2011; Ratcliffe 2016; Innes and Sheptycki 2004). It was driven initially in the UK by the desire for governments to maximise efficiencies and reducing costs by increasing the use of intelligence to drive strategic and operational decision-making. The implementation of intelligence led policing models into operational policing across \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries has had mixed results partly due to cultural, financial and leadership issues in agencies that have attempted to put intelligence at the centre of strategic and operational decision making in policing (Walsh 2011; Ratcliffe 2016). Nonetheless, despite historical challenges in adopting intelligence led approaches, increasing fiscal constraints and the ever increasing demands on law enforcement in managing both high volume crimes and complex operating environments in counter-terrorism, cyber and organised crime meant, at least in many national law enforcement agencies; a greater demand for an intelligence driven approach (Walsh 2011). This intelligence driven approach, which promulgated proactive disruption of crime strategies was in part an admission that not all crime could be prevented or the offenders prosecuted.",

In complex organised crime cases such as transnational drug trafficking, people smuggling and even terrorism and cyber threats, which we discuss shortly\u2014intelligence driven disruption strategies have become increasingly popular for many \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 law enforcement agencies. This has particularly been the case where it can be difficult to dismantle completely the organised crime group\u2014or to even know the full extent of the group\u2019s network. Disruption operations that attempt to take down threat actors with key roles (e.g. facilitator, financier, and logistics) may nonetheless reduce the threat posed by the organised crime network even if the network continues to exist. Additionally, with some organised crime networks, it may be difficult to secure sufficient evidence for prosecution against a more serious offence such as drug importation, but there may be sufficient intelligence that can be used to make the criminal environment more hostile for the group\u2019s illicit enterprise by arresting key group members for lesser offenses such as unexplained wealth or migration irregularities. While disruption of crime does seem like a useful tool in preventing or reducing the impact of offenders, the criminology literature demonstrates it has been difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of intelligence driven disruption strategies. Ratcliffe cited an RCMP disruption attributes tool, which attempts to examine where the disruption activity is aimed at (core business, financial, personnel) and whether the kind of disruption for one or more of these attributes is high, medium or low in impact (Ratcliffe 2008: 207). However, such tools are largely subjective and qualitative\u2014making it difficult to accurately measure the impact of intelligence driven disruption measures. The other concern about disruption strategies is that they may just cause displacement, where other criminal enterprises take the place of those removed by law enforcement or as Innes suggest, \u2018disrupting a network may just provide a vacuum for more dangerous offenders to step in\u2019 (Innes and Sheptycki 2004: 14). Finally, the literature suggest that employing effective disruption strategies rely on proactive collection and valid analysis that can led to both timely strategic and operational outcomes that in turn result in threat mitigation and harm minimisation.",

The answer is a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. Much of course depends on the nature of the threat and risk posed. Clearly as with any crime, it is hard to disrupt a bio-threat, when it\u2019s still in the head of the offender. However, we do know that criminal and terrorist acts don\u2019t just happen spontaneously. There usually involve predicate steps taken by the offender. Some of these might happen in very compressed periods while in other offences planning may take years. Either way, and regardless of whether these can be detected by the intelligence community, there is likely to be some signs in the predicate planning stages of an impending threat/risk that can provide the intelligence community opportunities for disruption. It is difficult to say in which bio-threat cases disruption strategies will be most successful. Much will depend on how quickly the intelligence community can collect and analyse information that may be indicative of an evolving bio-threat and risk. As discussed previously, good collection and analysis is contingent on having robust core intelligence processes in place and more importantly effective intelligence governance. Both are needed to ensure intelligence efforts are coordinated across multiple internal intelligence community stakeholders, with relevant knowledge\u2014as well as ensuring information and expertise from external stakeholders (the scientific community) is available to provide earlier warning signs of an emerging bio-threat.",

            "text": "While it is important not to over-play the potential for success of the kind of disruption strategies used against traditional organised crime groups, there are likely bio-threat scenarios where disruption strategies may make a difference. Arguably, disruption of bio-threats could be on a continuum with the individual threat actor on one end and a sophisticated organised group on the other. At the individual level one could have the scenario of a lone terrorist actor or a mad/bad scientist. While it may seem difficult to get early warning of the malicious act of mad/bad scientist, we saw in the earlier discussion on \u2018 insider threats\u2019 that it may be possible to disrupt their activity before you reach an Amerithrax style attack. Twenty/twenty is hindsight with the Bruce Ivins Amerithrax case, but the lessons learnt from this incident do provide guidance on the sources of collection and analysis required from within the intelligence and scientific communities to aid the disruption of this kind of bio-threat. It does not mean that all similar cases of \u2018 insider threats\u2019 will be detected, prevented or disrupted, but a more careful collection and analysis of \u2018odd\u2019 behaviour or unusual security lapses by a scientist working in a high containment lab could reveal areas of vulnerabilities. Detection both of abnormal changes to an individual\u2019s psychological profile and/or in their working environment can provide opportunities for those vulnerabilities to be disrupted. At the other end of the bio-threat scale, a more organised bio-criminal or terrorist planned event may resemble in some respects other illicit criminal markets and networks (drugs, identity fraud, money laundering) and thereby present opportunities for disruption. Again this is not to suggest that disruption of organised bio-threat scenarios will be always be possible. As discussed in earlier chapters, since 9/11, even with state based WMD programs the intelligence community has had a mixed record in detecting them and uncovering the intention and capability of non-state actors to exploit dual use technology for malicious end remains difficult.",

As Innes suggest in the case of counter terrorism operations, one aim is to overtly disrupt planned attacks, which has many effects including sending a message to other terrorist groups that they may be next, reassuring the community and if possible deploying countering violent extremism (CVE) strategies in communities where future attacks may arise (Innes et al. 2017: 253). In the UK in particular, a key plank in its counter terrorism strategy has been disruption both at the strategic and tactical level. At the strategic level, disruption has involved a number of initiatives from arresting persons of interest, legislative action and enhanced surveillance (Innes et al. 2017: 265).",

Just how useful strategic and tactical disruption strategies used in conventional counter-terrorism will be in the bio-threat context depends on the nature of the intent and capability of individual threat actor(s) and the risks posed by their actions. The effectiveness of disruption strategies in the bio-threat context like conventional terrorist attacks are contingent on a range of variables that are unique to that event. In the bio-threat context, leaving aside large levels of uncertainty about the future threat trajectory for bio-terrorism, effective disruption will rely on law enforcement and intelligence agencies understanding how the intention, capability and opportunities of threat actors operating in a particular environment\u2014make an attack possible. Intention, capability and opportunities will differ along the threat continuum from individual to group and from state to non-state actor. For example, in the research facility, hospital or high containment laboratory environment, intention, capabilities and opportunities may be shaped by actors that are internal, external or an indirectly involved in the facility (Perman et al. 2013: 95). Threats can also be as Perman suggest overt or clandestine (ibid.). In some cases, if a scientist is motivated politically (for religious, environmental or political reasons) to commit an act of violence by using a biological agent it may be easier to disrupt their activities if they are public about their agenda.

Similarly, in the lesser known case of Dr. Larry Ford, who was suspected of murdering his business partner in a biotech company\u2014the police subsequently found a cache of weapons, white supremacist writings and allegations that he attempted to infect six mistresses with biological agents (Perman et al. 2013: 94). Again even in cases of lone actors such as this whose attack planning is more clandestine; there may well be an abundance of \u2018warning intelligence\u2019 that if collected and assessed in time might be useful in disrupting a lone actor planned attack. While it can be difficult to disrupt a lone actor plot, more elaborate ones by a group of conspirators could in some circumstances provide greater opportunities for interception and disruption by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This is because in plots involving multiple actors there are more stages before the attack can be carried out. Some stages such as communications, procuring supplies and transport also provide points of vulnerability, where threat actors can be exposed to authorities and disrupted. So an external threat such as a terrorist attack against a high containment laboratory might involve communications amongst group members, financing of the plan, purchasing of explosives and surveillance of the facility\u2019s perimeters. Each stage presents opportunities for disruption providing intelligence and information is available to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Similarly a theft of intellectual property or biological material from a private sector biotechnology company might result from either an external criminal group; or state actor pressuring or paying an employee to steal information on their behalf. Again, intelligence may exist already about the criminal group or the compromised employee that provides opportunities for disruption.",

Pre-employment screening, including criminal checks and select agent risk assessments will show up some individuals, who are not suitable to access and work with dangerous biological agents. This will have an early disruptive effect but it is not fool proof. People can lie about their circumstances in security suitability checks allowing them the ability to access and plan malevolent acts in a secure biological facility rather than just thinking about them. Once operating inside a facility\u2014depending on the nature of the planned attack it can be very difficult for law enforcement and the intelligence community to respond quickly enough to disrupt the attack before its fully implemented. In all threat scenarios (simple to complex) in addition to the mandatory background checks for workers, each scientific institution needs to develop a full suite of threat assessments that can be updated regularly on different threat actors, including but not limited to: visitors, criminals, lone actor attacks (internal and external), terrorist and issued motived groups, international terrorists groups and foreign powers (Perman et al. 2013: 94). These threat assessments should be developed by an institution\u2019s internal security department in collaboration with local law enforcement. The relatively low number of threat scenarios that have taken place involving bio-agents since 9/11 will likely mean that there will be many intelligence gaps in assessing the intent, ability and opportunity of different threat types. However, providing baseline threat assessments will begin to build pictures of threats scenarios that should help promote better biosafety measures as well as opportunities to disrupt threats earlier should they begin to emerge.",

Since 9/11, countering terrorism continues to produce lessons for the law enforcement and intelligence communities on how more effectively to disrupt emerging terror plots before they are implemented. The knowledge gained from investigating conventional terrorism attacks that don\u2019t involve biology can help those working on future bio-threats and risks by seeing how to optimise the legislative, intelligence, investigative and community response to terrorism while also learning lessons from contemporary counter terrorism efforts. In particular, the increase in lone actor terrorist attacks in the west\u2014often with short notice underscores that either an insufficient amount of intelligence or types of intelligence that cannot be revealed in court often exists. In these cases, other tactical disruption strategies are gaining traction amongst \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries to mitigate the threat and harm posed by terrorists. Similarly, given the complexity of threat scenarios that could arise from the exploitation of dual use biotechnology, it may be difficult in some cases to collect sufficient solid \u2018evidence\u2019 or use bio-forensics to attribute confidently for a conviction on bioterrorism or bio-criminal activity. Nonetheless, the various counter terrorism strategies discussed above point to ways threat actors may be disrupted on lesser offences while also providing a greater intelligence dividend on other individuals involved.",

Both authors argue because of these similarities there is likely a lot cyber can learn from how bio-threats have been managed historically. This is undoubtedly true, though in this section the focus will be the opposite\u2014i.e. what can intelligence and investigative agencies working on bio-threats learn from the cyber threat and capability landscape? Even a cursory review of the literature suggest that there are a number of areas where current cyber research and practice could inform the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence communities understanding of current and emerging bio-threats and risks. Space does not allow an exhaustive discussion on all of them, but there are three cyber areas in particular; where I believe those working with bio-threats and risks could benefit greatly from knowing more about in order to learn the lessons from the cyber context as well as identifying good intelligence and investigative practice. These areas are: the dark web, cyber terrorism and cyber espionage. I will discuss each briefly in turn.",

Given the relative anonymity it provides, the dark web has seen the proliferation of child pornography, credit card fraud, identify theft, drugs and arms trafficking amongst other illicit offences. The dark web only emerged in recent years though law enforcement and intelligence agencies have made some in roads into its penetration and disruption. The FBI\u2019s shut down of the dark web site Silk Road, which operated between February 2011 and October 2013 was to that point the largest and most sophisticated anonymous online market place for illicit drugs (Zaj\u00e1cz 2017).

A first step might be first to map the bio-terrorism literature and identify researchers, who have access to bioterrorism agents/disease research, domain, institutions, countries and emerging topics and trends in bioterrorism agents/disease research. Chen shows how by using informatics research it might be possible to use knowledge mapping techniques, to analyse productivity status, collaboration status and emerging topics in the bio-terrorism domain (Chen 2011: 335\u2013367). Additionally, other intelligence and investigative teams that are working on non-bio threats such as conventional terrorist attacks, terrorism financing, drug trafficking or even child sexual exploitation may come across offenders, who have links to others interested in exploiting dual use biological agents for malevolent objectives. So the work currently going on by intelligence agencies working on broader cyber security issues such as cybercrime or cyber terrorism is directly relevant to improving collection and analysis against emerging bio-threats and risks.",

We have seen for example groups like the Taliban and IS increasingly use computers for recruitment, propaganda and communications, but it remains difficult to know empirically how many of the current virtual attacks such as ransomware can be attributed to terrorist or led to deaths or impacted critical infrastructure in significant ways.

We have seen in recent years the take down of government websites involving ransomware attacks on both government and private sector networks. Increasingly more information is being shared and stored via the Cloud. What would be the impact of a major ransomware attack that locks down the entire bio- surveillance capability of a public health authority such as CDC do to maintaining national health security? Could a cybercriminal group infiltrate the network of a major biodefense company steal IP and sell it to a terrorist group on the dark web? Could research stored via the Cloud on non-secure networks relating to the genetic sequences of pathogens be stolen by a terrorist group or state actor to engineer bio-weapons?

Since Amerithrax, across the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries further work has been done to better coordinate the work of law enforcement and public health agencies on treating bio-threats and risks. But such efforts have not involved routinely the broader spectrum of national security intelligence agencies, who have tended to play a more strategic and adhoc role compared to their law enforcement counterparts. Overall, policy, coordination and legislative efforts to bring first responders and members of the intelligence and law enforcement community together have had only mixed success for a number of reasons. In 2007, a study of how law enforcement and public health agencies in the US, Canada, UK and Ireland work together on bio-threat incidents identified several common barriers to improving multi-agency responses (Strom and Eyerman 2007). These included cultural, legal, structural, communication and leadership barriers (ibid.: 135). Ten years on from Strom and Eyerman\u2019s research, other researchers have made similar observations about the ability of first responders to manage effectively a bio-threat incident and to work with law enforcement and intelligence community on such tasks. But it\u2019s not just the capability issues raised above, other research points to other technical challenges to treating the impact of bio-threats and risks in the physical environment. For example, research by chemists and environmental engineers show that given the varying nature and strains of the bacteria\u2014the science for assessing risk of exposure may not be able to provide a fully accurate risk assessment of a building\u2019s vulnerability or resilience to a bio-attack nor\u2014in some cases whether first responders have effectively \u2018cleaned the environment up after exposure\u2019 (Canter 2007; Taylor et al. 2013). A lack of effectiveness in responding to a bio-threat incident in a local area obviously can have broader public sector implications in both treatment and preparedness of bio-risks. For example, Gerstein (2017: 86) citing a study by advocacy group Trust for America\u2019s Health reported that 26 states and DC scored 6/10 or lower on a scale for preparedness. Additionally, since 9/11 major disease outbreaks such as SARS and Ebola have also demonstrated fragility in parts of the world, including some \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 country\u2019s public health response capability, which remains a concern if there was a major bio-terrorist event.",

In the US, the report raised similar coordination issues between federal, state and local agencies in which first responder agency would take the lead in decontaminating and remediating environments and how other agencies would get involved to ensure the attack site was deemed safe for people to return (Blue Ribbon Study Project 2015: 26). One underlying theme arising from the studies mentioned on first responder\u2019s roles in treating bio-threats and risks is that the intelligence community must share more information with emergency services on the nature of the threat they are meant to respond to. This is not to suggest that in all the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries that no sharing is going on. My selected interviews with law enforcement and intelligence officials in each country did not give the impression that no sharing was going on with first responders. However it is clear if the local fire officers or emergency staff in a hospital are meant to better respond to a bio-incident they will need regular, consistent, reliable, real-time information and intelligence. This is vital to them safely securing the scene, or rapidly diagnosing and treating infected patients while also keeping themselves safe. Importantly too, the more intelligence they receive will likely be helpful in first responders preserving any relevant evidence from the scene that might be needed by the either the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Gerstein makes a valuable point when referring to improving bio-preparedness and response activities, when he suggests that first responders need to be seen as part of a complex system rather than each representing a series of programs (Gerstein 2017: 88).",

In each of these disciplines, discussion included exploration of relevant science, technology and knowledge useful for the intelligence community in preventing and disrupting bio-threats and risks. Some of that discussion, for example bio- surveillance, biosafety and strengthening global health is also relevant to our focus here in treating bio-incidents.

There are multiple roles engineering specialties could play and are playing in preventing, disrupting and treating bio-threats and risks. For one and historically, the US DOD has relied on engineers, microbiologists to provide advice on weaponisation of biological agents under a range of scenarios and conditions (state actor and terrorists threats). For example, even pre 9/11, between 1999 and 2000 DTRA funded Project Bacchus to see if a team of scientists and engineers, who allegedly did not have extensive experience in bio-weapons could make bio-weapon facility using just commercially available items. The objective was to see if the team could make anthrax successfully without the detection of the intelligence community, though it was later revealed that this team did have substantive technical knowledge and support throughout this project (Vogel 2013: 41\u201343). Engineers have also long been engaged in studying aerolisation dynamics, which has become increasingly a multi-disciplinary collaboration of environmental engineers, biomedical engineers, microbiologists, chemists and epidemiologists (Xu et al. 2011). Related to aerolisation studies has been the work of hardware and software engineers\u2014many of whom came from the aerospace and automotive industries that have brought their skills into modelling bio-terrorism attacks to help first responders predict how airborne particles might move through sections of a city under certain weather and windflow conditions (Thilmany 2005).",

Increased economic wealth, enhanced security technology (alarms, access control and CCTV), in addition to an increase in the control by a number of private sector companies of publicly accessible places have, amongst other factors all contributed to the growth in private sector security (ibid.: 727). While it is difficult to generalise \u2018as the functions of security officers/agencies are as varied as the organisations that employ them\u2019 (ibid.: 731), their functions and roles cut across many facets of each \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 nation to include office buildings, warehouses, shopping malls, education establishments, residential complexes and critical infrastructure. One often thinks of the classic scenario of a security guard standing in front of a physical gate, which is one role of many others which might also, depending on their functions include traffic control, surveillance, responding to emergencies, security vetting. In the security role of complex large companies, airports and electricity plants, it is likely that the security officers will have a deep understanding of their physical and virtual security environments and this kind of expert knowledge would be integral for them and the intelligence community gaining threat awareness, prevention, surveillance, disruption, treatment and recovery to bio threats and risks which may manifest in their operating environment.",

However, several studies on private and public sector security do show several areas of improvement across each \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 country. Some of these improvements have been initiated by governments such as in the UK making significant cuts to policing in the late 1990s and mid-2000s and seeking the private sector security sector to pick up more cheaply what were considered less core policing such as offender management and transfers of prisoners. In other cases, governments were interested in engaging with the private sector to extend their own security and intelligence collection capabilities with terrorism. Connors et al. (2000), Wakefield (2003), and Rigakos (2002) provide more detailed analysis of a range of factors that have been involved in building partnerships with private sector security companies in the US, UK and Canada respectively. 9/11 and of course subsequent terrorist attacks in many western countries has seen a more focused attempt by \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 countries to reach out to the private sector\u2014including private sector security given many attacks occur in public places owned or managed by the private sector. Threats as well to public and privately owned critical infrastructure (aviation, power, water, and telecommunication) have also influenced \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 government\u2019s closer liaison with the private sector. For example in the US, DHS has established a private sector office to provide government advice on relevant security issues to the private sector as well as promoting public-private partnerships. In Australia, since 9/11 parts of the Australian intelligence community, particularly ASIO has developed closer links with the private sector. In 2004 Australia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Department created the Business-Government Advisory Group on National Security to provide a vehicle for the Government to discuss a range of national security issues and initiative with CEOs and senior business leaders (DPM &C 2015: 6).
