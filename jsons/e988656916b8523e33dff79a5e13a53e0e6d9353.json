The model considers different levels of COVID-19 transmission during travel, daily arrival rate and total migrant workers. Indian states with significant migrant workers are considered to estimate the rise in confirmed and active COVID-19 cases. It is observed that reduced daily arrival rate of migrant workers can help Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to lower the rise in confirmed and active cases. By the end of May, 2020, the daily arrival rate of migrant workers will have similar effect on Rajasthan. For the daily arrival rate of migrant workers considered, Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active cases. Maharashtra, on the other hand, may experience marginal rise in the confirmed and active cases. A stringent policy to screen migrant workers for possible trace COVID-19 virus prior to the travel and stricter isolation norm after reaching the destination state can be helpful in reducing the rise in confirmed and actives cases attributed to the migrant worker transportation.",

Till April 29, 2020 total 33,065 confirmed, 8,429 recoveries and 1,079 deaths are reported in India (MoHFW, 2020). The Indian government has adopted social distancing as a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention. In this strategy, the large-scale population movement, which may accelerate the spread of contagious epidemic disease, is avoided or restricted. A 14hour voluntary public curfew was arranged on March 20, 2020 and subsequently nationwide lockdown was implemented on March 24, 2020 to slow down the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown has since been extended twice, up until May 17, 2020, and is affecting the 1.3 billion population of India.",

However, using lockdown to impose social distancing has immediate adverse effects on migrant workers, particularly those who are from the marginalized sections of the society and depends on their daily wages for living. These migrant workers are now stranded at various parts of the country with almost no source of income and no means to return to their respective native places. Documents submitted to the Supreme Court of India indicates approximately 10.55 million migrant workers are living in 22,567 shelters setup at various regions of India (Rawal et al., 2020) . These migrant workers, staying away from their family, are insecure and emotionally disturbed. A recent incidence of mass gathering on April 14, 2020 (the last day of first phase of lockdown) near railway stations at Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Surat (Gujarat) signifies their strong desire to return to their native places (Joshi et al., 2020) . These migrant workers are getting impatient and desperately exploring for opportunities to return, irrespective of the shelter and food arrangements (Gunjan, 2020) .",

The state government of Uttar Pradesh arranged transportation in the last week of April, 2020 to bring back students stranded in the state of Rajasthan. Similar arrangements are explored among states to transport the migrant workers. For this, the possible modes considered are bus and train. Each mode has its limitations and advantages in terms of capacity, speed and maximum possibility of infection. Various studies described the impact of lock-down on COVID-19 transmission in India (Singh and Adhikari, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2020; Mukhopadhyay and Chakraborty, 2020). However, no study is available to measures the impact of migrant workers returning to their origin state. So, this paper attempts to estimate the possible impact in terms of additional confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 in the selective Indian states with high returning migrant workers. The estimation considered different level of COVID-19 transmission during travel, daily arrival rate of migrant workers and returning migrant workers. A modified SEIR model is used to predict the rise in confirmed and active cases of the states reviewed.",

However, the most recent available data is from the 2011 census data (MoHA, 2020). Hence, the appropriate forecasting of the 2011 census data was warranted for this study. Models such as arithmetic increase method, geometric increase model, incremental increase method, decrease in growth rate method and logistic curve method are available for forecasting the population (Jensen, 1995) . Arithmetic increase method is suitable to forecast population for large and old cities where there is moderate or no development; geometric method is suitable for new locations where the industrial development has just initiated; incremental increase method is suitable for places with normal conditions; decrease in growth method is used to forecast population of the places which undergoes extraordinary changes like epidemic, war, or any natural disaster; and logistic method can be used for the places with limited land space and economic opportunity (Jensen, 1995) .

People of compartment further become exposed to COVID-19 at the rate of and eventually get infected at the rate of after interacting with an infected individual. These individuals are removed from the compartment and added to the compartment and subsequently to the compartment. The removal rate of from the compartment is equivalent to 1/incubation period or the latent time. Depending on the symptom and test protocol, certain people of the overall population are tested. If the tested person belongs to the compartment, the test result is expected to be positive. These individuals are either hospitalized or isolated in the pre-designated quarantined center. For a particular COVID-19 positive patient, hospitalization or quarantine center is decided based on their morbidity, age, pre-existing condition, etc. At both locations, these infected individuals are assumed to be isolated from rest of the population and may stop spreading the virus. So, in this study, hospitalized patients and quarantined individuals are considered to be in compartment.

So, in this study, prior to the inter-state transportation of migrant workers, the standard SEIR model have additional compartment of migrant workers. This compartment of migrant workers does not interact with any of the SEIR model compartments shown in Figure 1 . However, when transportations for migrant workers are arranged, a suitable interaction between the compartment of migrant workers and some of the standard SEIR compartments is established. Hence, at the beginning the model parameters i.e., , , , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 and 1 are estimated considering the present state population without the returning migrant worker distributed among the , , , , , and compartments. A migrant worker not infected with COVID-19 can be part of compartment. However, the migrant workers are not tested for COVID-19, only symptoms are monitored prior to boarding a train or a bus. In this process, an asymptomatic person and exposed individual cannot be detected. So, an asymptomatic person and exposed individual can board the bus or train and might become symptomatic prior to disembarking. The probability of someone being symptomatic depends on the location or the state they are currently residing. If the probability of being symptomatic and quarantined, estimated by considering the ratio of quarantined population and the total population of the region, in a particular state is F , the number of expected symptomatic persons among the migrant worker population FI traveling from state to state is F \u00d7 FI . Based on some recent test results, about twothird of the symptomatic population is expected to be asymptomatic. Further, an asymptomatic traveling in a confined coach of a train or bus can expose many co-passengers. Hence, an elevated value of F is considered to estimate the symptomatic number of migrant workers reaching state from state . These symptomatic migrant workers are expected to be quarantined (in hospital or quarantine center) at their destination state. The co-passengers from the same compartment of the symptomatic passenger might be quarantined as well. Otherwise, the migrant workers are expected to be in isolation for 14 days. The assumed situations of migrant worker at their origin and destination is shown in Figure 2 . So, when the migrant workers arrive at their destination state, the SEIR model of the destination state is updated by assigning the symptomatic migrant workers to the compartment, asymptomatic migrant to the compartment and remaining to the compartment. The updated SEIR model is shown in Figure 3 . Note the migrant worker population did not interact with any compartments of a standard SEIR model until the first arrival date. Time required to transport all migrant workers to their destinations will depend on the daily arrival rate of migrant workers. In this analysis, various daily arrival rates are considered for review and comparison. The states with significantly high in-and out-migration are considered in this study. It can be observed from Figure 5 that the states with higher number of in-migrants (i.e., the states where people migrated to) are Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, and states with higher number of out-migrants (i.e., the states from where people migrated) are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. These states contribute more than 50% of the in-and out-migrants population of India. The number of inand out-migrants forecasted for these states, for the year 2020, are shown in Table 2 . It is assumed that the migrants residing for more than four years in a state probably have permanently settled in that state. It is also considered that despite the pandemic COVID-19, these migrants would prefer staying at their current location. Therefore, the migrant worker expected to travel is derived from the people migrated in the last four years. Further, the approximate data of migrant workers willing to travel to their home state are verified from the local government's policies related to the migrant workers, news, and social media. ",

The obtained parameters are shown in Table 3 and fitted trends for confirmed, active, recovered and deceased are shown in Figure 6 . For all states except Bihar, the value representing the rate of being susceptible indicates about 10% of the population can become susceptible even in the present lockdown. In Bihar this rate is however less (about 2%). Similarly, for all states except Uttar Pradesh, the values indicate susceptible people can become exposed immediately after interacting with infected person. It supports the high contagious characteristics of COVID-19. However, for Uttar Pradesh this rate is low and may need further review for better understanding. The value indicating the rate of being infected after exposure is almost similar for all the states analyzed. In other words, the incubation time (1/ ) or latent time of COVID-19 is about 2 days. The other parameters are state specific and greatly depends on the confirmed, active, recovered and deceased cases recorded. The SEIR model used is a dynamic model with deterministic output and hence, the goodness of fit of the obtained trends is represented by RMSE values indicated in the corresponding plot.",

Therefore, this study analyzed the daily arrival rate of 20,000 (20k) to 100,000 (100k) migrant workers per state. As reasons indicated earlier, these migrant workers are assumed to become symptomatic at a rate 10 to 100 times higher than their migrated state rate. All combinations of these three factors (total number of migrant workers, daily arrival rate of migrant workers and rate to become symptomatic after reaching destination) are analyzed using the modified standard SEIR model shown in Figure 3 . The respective compartments of the model are updated for each arrival day and the confirmed and active COVID-19 cases are predicted until May 31, 2020. These confirmed and active COVID-19 cases are adjusted for the base scenario to estimate the rise in confirmed and active COVID-19 cases in a state due to the arriving migrant workers. The range between the first and third quartiles, and the median values (second quartile) of the additional number of confirmed and active COVID-19 cases are presented in Figure 7 . With stringent measures the rise in confirmed and active cases could be within the first quartile. However, in the worst situation, the rise in confirmed and active cases can go beyond the third quartile. Figure 7a) . However, as shown in Figure 7b , the rise in active cases for some states such as Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are either flattening or reducing in the last week of May, 2020. If the daily arrival rate of migrant workers increases to 100,000, among the states analyzed, Uttar Pradesh is expected to experience the largest rise in confirmed and active cases (see Figures 7c and 7d) . However, the number of additional active cases in Uttar Pradesh are expected to drop in the last week of May, 2020 (see Figure 7d ). Similar trend of reduction in active cases is observed for Rajasthan as well. Irrespective of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers considered, rise in confirmed and active cases in Madhya Pradesh are expected to rise at a higher rate till the end of analysis period. The effect of migrant workers returning to Maharashtra is nominal compared to all the states analyzed. The migrant workers leaving a particular state to return to their origin state is not adjusted in the present model. If adjusted, the rise in confirmed and active cases in Maharashtra are expected to be even lesser than the cases presented in this paper.",

Since lesser number of migrant workers are expected to return to Maharashtra, the rise in confirmed and active cases are predicted to be lower than the states analyzed. As indicated earlier, it may be even lower if the migrant workers leaving a state is considered. The daily arrival rate of migrant workers also affects the rise in confirmed and active cases. In spite of the highest number of migrant workers returning to Uttar Pradesh, maintaining a lower daily arrival rate can help Uttar Pradesh to keep the rise in confirmed and active cases low. The analysis reveals that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active cases after the arrival of migrant workers. However, as indicated earlier, stringent measures in screening migrant workers prior to boarding and strict isolation after arrival can help to keep the rise in confirmed and active cases under control. Some of the state governments have planned for 14 to 21 days quarantine of the arriving migrant workers (Kumar, 2020) . Alternatively, restarting industries with safe work environment might encourage the migrant workers to stay back. The Maharashtra and Karnataka state governments have started allowing a few industries, where migrant workers are generally employed, to operate (Poovanna, 2020) . Such activities would help the migrant workers to earn livelihood and reduce the demand for travel. Moreover, it will help to sustain the economy (Sastry, 2020) .",

This dataset contains daily information of \"confirmed\", \"recovered\" and \"death\" cases for all Indian states since March 14, 2020. Data available till April 29, 2020 is used to develop the model.Minimum 10 confirmed cases are considered to initiate the analysis. So, certain states like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, with late spread of infection, the analysis start day is sometime after March 14, 2020. The population considered in this model includes the state population and the returning migrant worker population of that state. The overall migrant population is forecasted considering the decadal growth factor of the population from the year 1981 to 2011 and the annual average growth of migrant population from the year 2001 to 2011. See Figure 4 for the process. Required information for it is acquired from the census data published by the Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India (MoHA, 2020). The current year population is forecasted using incremental increase method, shown in Equation 1, and the migrants growth rate is calculated using the annual average growth method, as shown in Equation 2. The overall migrant population is estimated considering both the growth rate of the migrant population and the overall population of the present year, as shown in Equation 3. Population of the last given decade = No. of decades \u0305 = Average increase in population S = Average incremental increase in population \u0305 = Annual average growth rate F & W = Migrant population of the initial and latest given years = Number of years for which the migrant population data is available M = Migrant population at n th year Forecasting of migrant population",

Transportation infrastructure capacity, human resource availability, logistics for disinfection, etc. should be reviewed to decide the daily arrival rate. For example, Bihar is unable to facilitate adequate number of buses to transport migrant workers across India (FE Online, 2020) and the Indian Railways could operate only 115 \"Shramik Trains\" (special trains for transporting migrant workers) from May 01 to 06, 2020 to transport more than 100,000 migrant workers within India (PTI, 2020b).",
