            "text": "\nCryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular protist parasite infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans (Bouzid et al., 2013). The clinical importance of Cryptosporidium spp. was highlighted when this parasite was associated with both waterborne and foodborne outbreaks (Efstratiou et al., 2017; Ryan et al., 2018). Currently, >30 species have been described and validated (Osman et al., 2017). However, due to strong inter-species similarities in microscopic size and shape, species within this genus require additional identification via genetic characterization. Molecular biology techniques have enabled the description of species that are highly host-specific, as well as others that are capable of infecting many hosts. Cryptosporidium parvum is considered to be the most prevalent species worldwide and a major zoonotic transmission risk (Xiao, 2010). Using molecular approaches to genetically characterise Cryptosporidium spp. has facilitated an improved understanding of cryptosporidiosis epidemiology (Xiao, 2010). Subtype analysis using the C. parvum 60 kDa glycoprotein locus (gp60) has revealed both human- and zoonotic-specific subtypes (Sulaiman et al., 2005).",

Cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves is mainly due to C. parvum infection, and is characterised by diarrhoea, dehydration, delayed growth, and weight loss, resulting in considerable economic losses associated with calf morbidity and mortality (Olson et al., 2004; Thomson et al., 2017). In addition, young calves have been considered as a potential source of human cryptosporidiosis in several outbreaks (Xiao, 2010). Besides C. parvum, cattle can also be infected by bovine specific species including C. bovis, C. andersoni and C. ryanae with a marked aged-related pattern (Fayer et al., 2006; Sant\u00edn et al., 2008). Asymptomatic adult cattle can also be sporadically infected by other species including C. felis (Cardona et al., 2015). It is well known that not all Cryptosporidium species excreted by cattle are zoonotic. Consequently, the molecular characterization of these species is vital to better understanding cattle cryptosporidiosis epidemiology and the zoonotic potential of specific Cryptosporidium isolates (Fayer et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Since the first report of the prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis in suckling (50\u201395%) and dairy calves (16.8\u201351,8%) in France in 1999 (Naciri et al., 1999), many cryptosporidiosis epidemiology studies have been solely based on faecal sample microscopy reporting different prevalences: 41.5% (Delafosse et al., 2015) and 17.9% (Lefay et al., 2000). However, these traditional staining or flotation screening methods can lead to suboptimal Cryptosporidium detection especially with reduced oocyst shedding intensity thus underestimating the real parasitic prevalence in herds. Thus far, only a few studies have used molecular tools to characterise Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle in 15 of the 95 metropolitan French departments (administrative regions): Allier, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, Ille-et-Vilaine, Landes, Mayenne, Morbihan, Moselle, Orne, Pas-de-Calais, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Deux-S\u00e8vres, Tarn, and Vend\u00e9e (Follet et al., 2011; Ngouanesavanh et al., 2006; Rieux et al., 2014, Rieux et al., 2013b, Rieux et al., 2013c, Rieux et al., 2013a). Little is known about which Cryptosporidium spp. infects calves in other French departments. However, subtype analysis solely on the basis of C. parvum gp60 amplicons is insufficient (Follet et al., 2011; Rieux et al., 2014, Rieux et al., 2013c, Rieux et al., 2013a), thus there is a strong need for more molecular epidemiological data on French bovine cryptosporidiosis to fully determine the breadth of C. parvum genetic diversity. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterise Cryptosporidium isolates in calves from different French departments: Allier, Ard\u00e8che, C\u00f4te-d'Or, Moselle, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, and Yonne. Furthermore, through genetic characterization, this study led the authors to investigate the potential of calves as a zoonotic reservoir for human infection.",

In order to perform anonymous sampling, farms were arbitrarily numbered from E1 to E26 and collected faecal samples were labelled B1 to B35. A map (Fig. 1\n) representing the origin of the samples was edited using Cartes et Donn\u00e9es- \u00ae Articque (https://www.articque.com/solutions/cartes-et-donnees/). Samples were directly collected from the rectum using plastic gloves and transferred into a sterile plastic container. Samples were maintained at 4 \u00b0C for a maximum of 48 h prior to processing and analysis. For each animal, the sampling date, animal identification number, age, and faecal score were recorded. Faecal consistency was scored on a scale from 0 to 4 (0: normal without mucus; 1: pasty and thick, formed or not, viscous 2: creamy; 3: semi-fluid; 4: liquid) as modified from Koudela and Jir\u00ed (1997).

            "text": "Several different techniques currently exist to detect Cryptosporidium infection in animal and/or human faecal samples (Chalmers and Katzer, 2013). In the present study, DFA screening was used to detect the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts. This technique is recommended as a screening method in epidemiological studies (Thompson and Ash, 2016) due to its high sensitivity and rapidity, however a major disadvantage is that it is unable to differentiate between Cryptosporidium species (Amar et al., 2004). In our study, the apparent occurrence was estimated at 88.6% using DFA as a diagnostic screening technique. This high value suggests that Cryptosporidium is a common parasite in pre-weaned calves in France, and is also similar to that seen in other French epidemiological studies. In the Brittany region (north-west France), 70.4% (100/142) of studied calves were reported to be infected by Cryptosporidium spp. (Follet et al., 2011) using 18S rRNA nested-PCR techniques. In the Deux-S\u00e8vres department, a 92\u2013100% occurrence of Cryptosporidium infection in calves was reported using DFA (Rieux et al., 2014). High Cryptosporidium occurrence in calves has also been reported in other countries (e.g. the USA and Vietnam) (Nguyen et al., 2007; Sant\u00edn et al., 2004). However, a relatively low occurrence was recently described in western France where only 402 out of the 968 (41.5%) analysed samples were positive using the Ziehl-Neelsen fuchsin staining method (Delafosse et al., 2015). A worldwide Cryptosporidium occurrence ranging from 3.4 to 96.6% has been reported in calves as previously reviewed (Thomson et al., 2017). This extraordinarily broad variation in Cryptosporidium infection occurrence with extreme dissimilarities between countries may be due to geographical distribution (location of study farms), climatic conditions, and different farm management practices, but also may relate to study design (number of specimens collected, number of studied farms, specimen collection season, the diagnostic method used, etc.). Some of these factors may also influence Cryptosporidium transmission between animals (Bamaiyi and Redhuan, 2016; Causap\u00e9 et al., 2002; Maurya et al., 2013; Mohammed et al., 1999; Ranjbar and Fattahi, 2017). In addition to substantial differences in farm management, the lower average age of infected calves in the present study might account for the higher occurrence, since Cryptosporidium tends to be more frequently present in younger calves aged less than one month (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004).",

This high level of oocyst excretion reflects that of other studies performed in France which report that oocyst excretion intensity can reach 8 \u00d7 106 oocysts per gram of faeces in some calves (Rieux et al., 2013b). When we compared our DFA method with oocyst concentration to that without, we observed oocyst loss in 65.5% of samples, which has previously been reported for concentration steps. However, these purification techniques are still acceptable for use in young ruminants because they excrete such a large number of oocysts (Fayer et al., 2000). On the other hand, oocyst concentration may facilitate PCR detection of Cryptosporidium by eliminating naturally-occurring PCR inhibitors from faeces (Elwin et al., 2012).",

This result is in accordance with previous studies (El-Khodery and Osman, 2008; Trotz-Williams et al., 2007) which have reported a strong correlation between Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding and calf diarrhoea. Nevertheless, it is important to compare infection intensity (oocyst shedding) with the species or subtypes detected by PCR, and faecal consistency, when generating inferences about the clinical impact of cryptosporidiosis. DFA results highlighted the absence of any correlation between calf age, oocyst shedding intensity, and C. parvum subtypes. This observation could be explained by the fact that animals were not all infected at the same time, at the same age, and the infectious dose may not have been the same. In addition, when the intestinal epithelium is severely damaged by Cryptosporidium infection, parasitic reproduction is impaired, even though marked diarrhoeal clinical signs are observed.",

            "text": "Despite positive microscopic identification of oocysts in samples, PCR analysis of the two 18S rRNA and gp60 target genes was only positive in 93.5% and 90% samples, respectively. Although the nested PCR method has been described as very sensitive and specific (Bhat et al., 2014), this failure to yield PCR products was due to the unsuccessful PCR amplification. These false negative PCR results could be explained by many factors: low numbers of oocysts in some samples, the presence of PCR inhibitors in faecal samples (haemoglobin, bilirubin, and bile acids), failed extraction procedures, failed oocyst disruption and lysis, insufficient DNA collected, or nucleic acid degradation (Johnson et al., 1995; Lantz et al., 1997; McLauchlin et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2009). Thus far, four common Cryptosporidium species have been identified in cattle: C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae, and C. andersoni, but only C. parvum is associated with clinical disease in neonatal calves, as older animals (>6 weeks) exhibit asymptomatic oocyst shedding (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2013). The recent observation of C. hominis in symptomatic and asymptomatic calves in France (Razakandrainibe et al., 2018) emphasises the importance of identifying which Cryptosporidium species is shed by calves. The calves included in this study were all younger than 45  days, thus the finding that 100% of animals were infected with C. parvum via 18S rRNA gene based-PCR-RFLP was similar to previous studies demonstrating high C. parvum occurrence in pre-weaned calves (Kv\u00e1c et al., 2006; Sant\u00edn et al., 2004). Our data also confirms that neonatal cryptosporidial diarrhoea in calves is primarily caused by C. parvum (de Graaf et al., 1999; Sant\u00edn et al., 2004). In contrast to a previous reports (Bj\u00f6rkman et al., 2015), no mixed infections were detected in the present study, which could be attributed to the significant C. parvum presence as opposed to other Cryptosporidium species which may represent smaller subpopulations. Species-specific multiplex PCR or real-time PCR could be used to detect any low-level infections (Tanriverdi et al., 2003).",

This subtype family was described in European countries, such as in calves from Italy (D\u00edaz et al., 2018), Belgium (Geurden et al., 2007), but never previously reported in France. Thus, the present study is the first to report the presence of the IId subtype in French calves. It appears that this subtype family is not restricted to a few farms, but could be easily transmitted to other animals (predominantly young ruminants) or to humans (Wang et al., 2014; Xiao, 2010).",

The high occurrence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype family infections (IIa, IId) in pre-weaned French calves confirms that calves should be considered as a real source of infection and a potential zoonotic reservoir for human infections. Our results also demonstrate that the Cryptosporidium population detected in France is more diverse than previous studies would suggest. As a consequence, molecular studies in other regions, including in calves and small ruminants, are needed to improve our understanding of cryptosporidiosis epidemiology and C. parvum subtype diversity in France.",
