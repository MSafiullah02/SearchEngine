However, its (patho)physiological roles and its architecture are more complex than initially anticipated. Novel RAAS components that may add to our understanding have been discovered in recent years. In particular, the human homologue of ACE (ACE2) has added a higher level of complexity to the RAAS. In a short period of time, ACE2 has been cloned, purified, knocked-out, knocked-in; inhibitors have been developed; its 3D structure determined; and new functions have been identified. ACE2 is now implicated in cardiovascular and renal (patho)physiology, diabetes, pregnancy, lung disease and, remarkably, ACE2 serves as a receptor for SARS and NL63 coronaviruses. This review covers available information on the genetic, structural and functional properties of ACE2. Its role in a variety of (patho)physiological conditions and therapeutic options of modulation are discussed.",

Its architecture and functions are more complex than previously assumed. In the classical RAAS, the protease renin, which is secreted from renal juxtaglomerular cells, acts on the circulating precursor angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin (Ang) I ( Figure 1 ). Ang I is converted by the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to Ang II, the main effector substance of the RAAS, with potent vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-fibrotic properties. Consequently, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in hypertension, heart failure, and progressive renal damage. [101] , with permission resemble exons in the ACE gene [3] . Two alternative transcripts of the mouse ACE2 gene have been identified which probably arise by alternative splicing [8] .",

Critical active site residues, including the His-Glu-Met-Gly-His zinc-binding motif, are highly conserved. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein orientated with the N-terminus and the catalytic site facing the extracellular space (an ectoenzyme), where it can metabolize circulating peptides. The small Cterminal, cytoplasmic domain has a number of potential regulatory sites. The similarity with ACE relates only to its topology and much of the extracellular domain ( Figure 2 ); the juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of ACE2 share similarity with the renal, transmembrane protein collectrin [10] (Figure 2 ), which stimulates insulin exocytosis and pancreatic beta-cell proliferation [11, 12] . Targeted deletion of the collectrin gene in mice suggests that it also plays a major role in regulating renal amino acid transport [13] .",

Specifically, there was a 40% decrease in fractional shortening with slight ventricular dilatation. Interestingly, there was thinning of the left ventricular (LV) wall rather than LV hypertrophy and/or cardiac fibrosis. These changes progressed with age and were more prominent in male mice [28] . The hearts of these Ace2 KO mice showed increased Ang II levels and up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes. The authors suggest that cardiac function is modulated by the balance between ACE and ACE2, and that the increase in local cardiac Ang II was involved in these abnormalities. This is supported by the fact that the cardiac phenotype and increased Ang II levels were completely reversible by concomitant deletion of the ACE gene in Ace2 KO mice. It remains unclear, however, why, despite elevated Ang II levels, the hearts of these Ace2 KO mice did not show any cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. This may partly be related to Ang II-independent effects of ACE2, such as effects of the [22] , which also can influence cardiac contractility.",

Crackower et al [28] were the first to test ACE2 as the gene underlying the blood pressure locus on the X chromosome. They showed reduced expression of renal ACE2 in the salt-sensitive Sabra hypertensive rat compared with the normotensive rat. Both hypertensive SHR and SHRSP rats showed reduced renal ACE2 protein levels compared with the normotensive Sabra and WKY strains. Two other groups confirmed some of these findings by showing that SHR rats have lower renal ACE2 mRNA, protein, and activity compared with WKY rats [44, 45] . However, others were unable to detect any differences in renal ACE2 mRNA, protein, and activity between adult hypertensive rats and their normotensive controls [46] . On close scrutiny, in SHRSP rats the allele of the previously identified blood pressure locus on rat chromosome X contributes to a blood pressure-lowering effect [42] , while in the saltsensitive Sabra hypertensive rat this allele contributes to a blood pressure-increasing effect [43] , suggesting that it is not the same gene that underlies the blood pressure locus. Surprisingly, while the allelic effects of the blood pressure locus are discordant between these hypertensive strains, a similar, ie concordant, reduction in renal ACE2 expression was reported [28] , which reduces the possibility that ACE2 is the candidate gene underlying the blood pressure locus.",

Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the susceptibility for proteinuria-associated renal damage in experimental conditions [55, 56] . Furthermore, Ang II is increased in damaged tubules as a possible mediator of further renal damage in experimental and human renal disorders [57, 58] . A disrupted balance between intrarenal ACE and ACE2 with consequent high levels of Ang II might therefore contribute to progressive renal damage. Indeed, in experimental hypertension and diabetes, renal ACE2 expression is decreased [28, 59] . Moreover, Tikellis et al showed that in the kidneys of SHR rats ACE2 expression follows a developmental pattern with declining expression during development and onset of hypertension [45] . In line with the beneficial effects of RAAS blockade on cardiac ACE2 as mentioned earlier, renal ACE2 activity is also increased in response to ACEi and ARB [59, 60] . In Figure 4 . Immunohistochemical staining pattern of ACE2 in the kidney. In the healthy human kidney (A), ACE2 is predominantly present in the brush border of proximal tubular cells (arrow) and to a lesser extent in the glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium. In rat kidney (B), ACE2 is predominantly found in glomeruli and to a lesser extent in distal tubules (open arrow). In mouse kidney (C), the distribution pattern of ACE2 is comparable to human kidney with predominant expression in proximal tubules (arrow). ACE2 is also expressed during human nephrogenesis (gestational age 16 weeks) (D)",

The authors hypothesized that the glomerular abnormalities were caused by chronic exposure to increased circulating and tissue Ang II, as these abnormalities were abolished by ARB treatment. The glomerulo-protective role of ACE2 is supported by studies in which chronic infusion of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 increased albuminuria in db/db mice, resulting in increased deposition of glomerular fibronectin [52] . Albuminuria could be prevented by ARB, indicating Ang II dependency. Moreover, these diabetic female db/db mice have decreased glomerular ACE2 staining compared with db/m heterozygous littermates [52] . The authors suggest that glomerular ACE2, present in the podocyte/slit diaphragm complex, could normally be reno-protective by favouring rapid degradation of Ang peptides and thereby preventing exposure to high levels of Ang II.",

In humans, de novo expression of ACE2 is found in glomerular and peritubular endothelium in biopsies in patients with primary and secondary renal disease, as well as in renal transplants [51] .

However, it was recently shown that loss of ACE2 expression precipitates severe acute lung failure [76] . Moreover, injection of recombinant human ACE2 attenuates acute lung failure in Ace2 KO as well as in wild-type mice [76] . With respect to the possible role of ACE2 in the lung in relation to acute lung injury in particular, the relationship to the ACE2 expression at the alveolar capillary interface is of interest. It is tempting to speculate that increased ACE2 may play a role in reducing the initial leakage over the alveolar capillary interface. This would then slow down the vicious circle that often occurs after a damaging effect to this interface and leads to the clinical pathological picture of diffuse alveolar damage with intra-alveolar oedema and fibrin deposits. These data support a critical role for the intrapulmonary RAS in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and show that ACE2 is a key molecule involved in the development and progression of acute lung failure. human CoV-NL63 [78, 79] , positive stranded RNA viruses with a 'corona'-like appearance [80] . Their genome is packaged together with several membrane proteins, the RNA binding nucleoprotein and the receptor binding spike protein that protrudes through the virion membrane. HCoV-NL63 infection causes clinical respiratory symptoms resembling those observed in children infected with common cold viruses. SARS-CoV causes severe lower respiratory tract disease including fever, non-productive cough, myalgia, and dyspnoea [81] . A specific region within the SARS-CoV spike protein (S1) interacts with ACE2 [79, 82, 83] . The crystal structure at 2.9 angstrom resolution of this receptor binding domain bound with the peptidase domain of human ACE2 shows that it presents a gently concave surface, which cradles the Nterminal lobe of the peptidase [82] . After engagement with ACE2, SARS-CoV fuses with host cell membranes, by which the conformational changes of the two heptad regions located in the S2 region, HR-1 and HR-2, cause the formation of an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes.",

In addition, spike proteins from isolates of palm civets utilized civet ACE2 more efficiently than human ACE2, whereas late-phase isolates such as TOR2 utilized both receptors with equal efficiency [92] . Subsequent studies demonstrated that sequence variation in the spike protein binding sites of ACE2 hindered efficient binding [92] (Figure 5 ). The lower affinity of some of these S proteins could be complemented by altering specific residues within the S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 to those of civet ACE2, or by altering S-protein residues 479 and 487 to residues conserved during the 2002-2003 outbreak. This indicates that specific molecular interactions are important in the adaptation process of SARS-CoV to human cells. Animal precursors of SARS-CoV are thus likely to be less pathogenic to humans, and exposure to such viruses may have led to limited clinical symptoms but antigenic stimulation that results in a serological response. This was observed when SARS-CoV re-emerged in Guangdong in 2003, causing milder clinical disease [93] . Similarly, animal traders had high seroprevalence for human and animal SARS coronavirus, without having a history of SARS.",

Further understanding of its role in disease will hopefully lead to the exploration of novel therapeutic options. Functional studies using ACE2 inhibitors will be essential to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of ACE2. Moreover, relatively little progress has been made on the development of [94] , with permission such specific ACE2 inhibitors, largely because of lack of a clear therapeutic target. MLN4760 is the most potent and selective ACE2 inhibitor currently available [98] . Structure-based screening programmes have been applied to the identification of novel and selective ACE2 inhibitors with some success [99, 100] . Since ACE2 opposes the vasoactive and proliferative actions of Ang II, up-regulation of ACE2 expression or activity is a much more desirable characteristic. Modification of ACE2 levels by stimulating its expression or exogenous administration of recombinant ACE2 may have beneficial effects in several disease conditions and should be the scope of future studies.",
