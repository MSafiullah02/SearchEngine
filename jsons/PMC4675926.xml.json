There were no significant differences in duration of fever before admission, or presence of respiratory symptoms. Therefore we cannot say that these clinical findings are helpful to differentiate the pathogen. Furthermore, laboratory results cannot distinguish between different etiologies because there were no significant differences in serum WBC, ANC, CRP, CSF CRP and CSF WBC levels. There were some differences in CSF protein and glucose levels, but these were not enough to differentiate the pathogens.",

Virus isolation using cell culture and neutralizing antibody assays is an established standard method to diagnose enteroviral infection. However, it is known that viral culture takes more than a week to yield a result and is less sensitive5). RT-PCR, genetic diagnosis, fluorescent antibody testing, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are recently developed testing method6) to replace viral culture. Among them, RT-PCR is a rapid and accurate method to diagnose enterovirus. It is possible to detect enterovirus using PCR within 24 hours, and Ahmed et al.7) quantified the sensitivity and specificity of enteroviral PCR as 92% and 94%, respectively.",

A lower cost, nervous system-specific virus panel including common etiologies such as enterovirus and herpes simplex virus would be very helpful in the diagnosis of meningitis in the future.
