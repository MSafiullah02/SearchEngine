The disease is endemic in Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Americas, as well as in some African countries (Greiser-Wilke et al. 2000; Tu et al. 2001; Deng et al. 2005; Cha et al. 2007; Postel et al. 2013). In Korea, live vaccines have been used traditionally to control swine fever where all pigs must be vaccinated early in life (Lim et al. 2016). Although the vaccine works and is inexpensive, it lacks stability, and it is hard to distinguish between pigs infected with swine fever and pigs that have been vaccinated (the DIVA concept; differentiating infected from vaccinated animals), which limits the pig trade. Because of this, DIVA vaccines have emerged as important lines of study and many groups have focused on generating marker vaccines.",

            "text": "CSFV has a genome of about 12.3 kb, which encodes a 3898 amino acid polypeptide from which four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1, and E2) and eight nonstructural proteins (Npro, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) are generated (Meyers et al. 1996). Of the four CSFV structural proteins, the E2 glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies generated during CSFV infection and is considered a major antigenic protein in the vaccine market (Ahrens et al. 2000; Bouma et al. 1999; Dewulf et al. 2000). CSFV subunit vaccines have been developed using recombinant E2 proteins expressed in insect cells (Ahrens et al. 2000; Bouma et al. 1999, 2000) and, BAYOVAC\u00ae CSF Marker (Advasure\u00ae, Pfizer, UK) and Porcilis\u00ae Pesti (IDEXX CSF marker, IDEXX Europe B.V., the Netherlands) are commercially available in Europe market. Although they were shown to provide protection against CSFV infection, there were reports that they didn\u2019t efficiently provide early protection and transplacental transmission (Depner et al. 2001; van Oirschot 2003). In addition to insect cells, other systems using yeast and mammalian cells are also used to produce recombinant E2 proteins (Lin et al. 2012; Hua et al. 2014). However, large-scale manufacturing of these expression system remain expensive. The genotypes of CSFV can be classified into three major groups with several subgroups (Paton et al. 2000; Postel et al. 2013) and it has reported that antibodies specific to one genotype E2 might not provide protection to other CSFV genotypes (Luo et al. 2013). Therefore, in order to effectively protect against the prevalent CSFV in south Korea, it is necessary to develop a vaccine using the E2 protein for this genotype.",

Among other things, plant-based production of recombinant proteins is an attractive platform because plants are easy to grow, produce large amounts of protein, and do not require expensive facilities (Nandi et al. 2016; Sabalza et al. 2014; Lomonossoff and D\u2019Aoust 2016; Rybicki 2017). The E2 protein produced by Arabidopsis thaliana reacts with antibodies against the native E2 protein. In addition, Arabidopsis thaliana-derived E2 antibodies in a mouse can recognize the native E2 protein suggesting that structure of plant-produced E2 is comparable to native E2 protein (Sohn et al. 2018). In addition, transient expression of recombinant E2 protein from the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana or from the leaves of transgenic N. benthamiana lines generates antibodies that can neutralize CSFV in pigs and protect them against subsequent challenge with CSFV (Laughlin et al. 2019; Park et al. 2019).",

The tail (Fc region) of these immunoglobulin molecules modulates immune cell activity by interacting with cell surface receptors and with proteins belonging to the complement system (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch 2008). Fusion of the Fc domain with a specific antigenic protein ensures an immune response to that antigen. The main reason for fusing proteins to the Fc domain is to enhance solubility and the half-life of an antigenic protein (Kontermann 2011; Levin et al. 2015). In addition, the Fc region enables easy and cost-effective purification of recombinant protein by protein A chromatography (Carter 2011; Ghose et al. 2006; Huang 2009).",

            "text": "To investigate whether the recombinant pmE2:pFc2 (porcine Fc fragment) fusion was effective as a vaccine, we first constructed a DNA construct for expression in plants. The E2 protein was expressed at high levels after targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This was achieved by adding an upstream BiP leader sequence and a downstream HDEL ER retention signal. In addition, we inserted 17 nucleotides into the 5\u2032 UTR region and an Arabidopsis HSP terminator into the 3\u2032 UTR region to increase expression (Kim et al. 2014; Nagaya et al. 2010). Previously, we tested three different Fc domains (pFc1, pFc2, and pFc3) from Sus scrofa and found out that pFc2 showed strongest expression in N. benthamiana (data not shown). Therefore, we fused the pFc2 domain downstream of the pmE2 coding sequence to generate the pmE2:pFc2 fusion construct (Fig. 1a). The pFc2:pmE2 fusion protein generated by transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens was detected in the soluble fraction, indicating that pFc2 increases the solubility of the antigenic protein (Fig. 1b, c). When we looked more closely, we noted a strong band at around 70 kD. The expected size of the E2 recombinant protein is 64 kD; therefore, the strong band appeared to be larger than expected. We assume that this is due to N-glycosylation since E2 protein has putative 7 N-glycosylation sites (Laughlin et al. 2019). Consistent with this, previous studies reported that CBD-fused E2 recombinant proteins have several N-glycosylation sites and are larger than expected when expressed in plants (Park et al. 2019; Sohn et al. 2018). In addition, the pFc2 domain contains one N-glycosylation site suggesting that the larger size is caused by N-glycosylation of both pmE2 and pFc2. To test expressional superiority of the pFc2 fusion, we compared expression levels of pmE2:pFc2 with cellulose-binding domain (CBD):pmE2 by western blotting (Fig. 1d). CBD is derived from Clostridium thermocellum and binds to cellulose; therefore, it can be used as a tag for protein purification (Park et al. 2019). As a result, the amount of pmE2:pFc2 was much higher than that of CBD-fused pmE2 when total extracts were prepared from identical fresh weight of leaves. There results suggested that pFc2 fusion increases the expression level of pmE2 protein as well as solubility.",

To select the most strongly expressed line among four T2 generation plants, we performed further western blot analysis and finally obtained total extracts from two or three lines (Fig. 2a).

However, we showed previously that the E2 protein fused to a CBD was expressed in plants as an oligomer (Park et al. 2019). Moreover, pFc2 forms dimers via the tail part of the antibody (Janeway et al. 2001). Thus, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions to investigate whether purified pmE2 protein forms dimers or oligomers when expressed in plants. We observed a band that was much larger than that expected for the protein only under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4a). This indicates that the recombinant protein was multimeric. To confirm this, we subjected the purified protein to size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4b). We observed a small peak at 54 ml and a major peak at 60 ml; no peak was observed in the fraction corresponding to a monomer (78 ml). The major peak was slightly larger than the peak corresponding to 150 kDa (64.18 ml). To confirm that these peaks were pmE2, each fraction from each peak was analyzed by native-PAGE; bands were observed at sizes corresponding to a tetramer or a pentamer (Fig. 4c). By contrast, no protein was in the fraction corresponding to the peak at 54 ml (data not shown). This result is consistent with data derived from CBD-fused pmE2. Therefore, we believe that these characteristics are due to pmE2 itself, rather than to the tags, when expressed in plants.",

Anti-CSFV antibody levels in all mice increased gradually, peaking at 4\u20135 weeks. These levels were maintained or decreased slightly until week 8 indicating that the chimeric protein produced from plant acts as an antigen. In addition, we used mouse serum (week 8) to test for neutralizing antibodies (Table 1) in order to investigate whether the antibody against recombinant pmE2 can provide protection against CSFV. Most sera had neutralizing antibody titers of 27\u201329, although slight variations were observed.

            "text": "Most CSFV vaccines in use today in CSF-endemic areas, including Asia, are modified live vaccines (MLV); although MLVs provide good protection against CSFV infection, it is difficult to distinguish between infected and vaccinated pigs (Blome et al. 2006; Deng et al. 2005; van Oirschot 2003). Therefore, it is difficult to prove that the area is free from this disease, which constrains import and export of pigs. To solve these problems, subunit marker vaccines are being developed. Many studies are examining the efficacy of vaccines based on the CSFV E2 glycoprotein; indeed, some products have come to market: BAYOVAC\u00ae CSF Marker (Advasure\u00ae, Pfizer, UK) and Porcilis\u00ae Pesti (IDEXX CSF marker, IDEXX Europe B.V., the Netherlands). The two viral glycoproteins E2 and Erns are necessary for viral attachment to host cells; of these, E2 is the major envelop glycoprotein that induces production of anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies (K\u00f6nig et al. 1995; Weiland et al. 1990). Previously, we demonstrated that an E2 glycoprotein fused with a CBD was immunogenic in pigs and confirmed that it provided efficient protection against CSFV challenge (Park et al. 2019). Here, we intended to use the recombinant protein Fc domain from pig IgG as an alternative to the CBD and evaluate its efficacy in animals. An ideal vaccine should not only be efficient and safe, but also affordable for end-users. Simple and successful expression of large amounts of recombinant protein with high immunogenicity is the key to cost-effectiveness. This is why we chose the porcine IgG Fc domain as the fusion partner. The Fc domain improved solubility and increased expression of E2 when expressed in plants. In addition, the Fc domain makes isolation of recombinant proteins by protein A affinity chromatography both easy and cheap. Although protein A resin is not cheap, appropriate use and management through a cleaning-in-place protocol means that hundreds of purification cycles can be performed without disassembly of the equipment, resulting in significant economic benefits (Gronberg et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2017). The most important advantages of the Fc domain are that it increases the half-life of an antigenic peptide in plasma and interacts with Fc receptors on immune cells, thereby acting as a molecular adjuvant. Taking advantage of these benefits, we produced 302 mg recombinant pmE2 protein from 1 kg tobacco leaves. This is around tenfold higher than that reported previously using CBD:pmE2 (30.3 mg/kg) (Park et al. 2019). Although the benefits of low manufacturing costs have been mentioned in producing recombinant proteins from plants, there has been much debate due to the lack of research. There are a few techno-economic analyses for producing recombinant proteins in plants (Buyel anf Fisher 2012; Tuse et al. 2014; Walwyn et al. 2015; Nandi et al. 2016). These simulation reports suggest that cost-effective production with plant expression system can be achieved over alternative platforms although it depends on the products. In addition, high expression of recombinant proteins contributes to lower capital requirements and cost of final products. Therefore, the subunit vaccine based on pFc2-fused pmE2 chimeric protein can help to provide protection against CSFV at a lower price.",

            "text": "Previous reports show that E2 protein exists as a dimer, as does the Fc domain. However, we found that pFc2:pmE2 was expressed as a multimer. Consistent with this, when CBD-fused E2 was expressed in plants, the product was also multimeric (Park et al. 2019; Sohn et al. 2018). According to size-exclusion chromatography, the protein seemed to form trimer considering that the peak was slightly larger than the peak corresponding to 150 kD. However, native-PAGE displayed the band corresponding to tetra or pentamer size. Because the migration of the protein on native-PAGE is affected by diverse factors such as size, folding and isoelectric point, it may not perfectly match with molecular markers. Therefore, more research is needed to establish the structure of pmE2:pFc2, and to examine how it affects the immunogenicity of recombinant proteins and their potential use as vaccines.",

            "text": "In this study, we used pmE2:pFc2 expressing transgenic plants instead of transient expression system. Transient expression generally has been shown to give high amount of target protein than stably expressing transgenic plants (Yamamoto et al. 2018) and we also obtained same results with this fact (data is not shown in here). Thus, assuming that transient expression uses the same biomass, more protein can be produced in a short period and many plant-based pharmaceutical companies are already using the platform. However, there are several reason why we used transgenic plants to produce the recombinant protein. In case of transient expression system, the expression level of target genes is not uniformed. On the other hand, transgenic plant provide stable expression of recombinant genes once the homozygous transgenic lines are generated. This leads to large-scale production easier than transient system. In economic point of view, upstream processes in transient expression system require additional equipment and material for A.tumefaciens-mediated infiltration while they can be eliminated in transgenic approach, which enables to produce recombinant proteins more inexpensively (Garabagi et al. 2012). Moreover, transient expression system requires additional step to avoid concerns relating to endotoxins that is caused by the use of A.tumefaciens for vacuum infiltration. For these reasons, we think it is more appropriate to use transgenic plants in situations where vaccines must be produced steadily, whereas transient expression system is suitable for urgent situations.",

            "text": "Next, we examined neutralizing antibody responses to CSFV virus in mice and pigs. We found that vaccination of mice and pigs with pmE2:pFc2 generated anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies. The pig experiments showed a slight increase in the titer of neutralizing antibodies at 20 days post-primary vaccination, and a dramatic increase in titer after the second vaccination. Neutralizing antibody titers were maintained at 6 (log2) until 170 days, although they did fall slightly thereafter. In addition, neutralizing antibodies were readily detectable in mouse serum even at 8 weeks post-vaccination. It is desirable to minimize the number of vaccination to reduce the burden on end users. We confirmed a single vaccination generated antibodies at levels similar to a double vaccination indicating that one-dose injection with 1 \u00b5g of pmE2:pFc2 is enough to induce immune responses in mice. Taken together, the results suggest that pmE2:pFc2 induces an efficient neutralized antibody response to CSFV. A limitation is that we vaccinated animals with a single dose (150 \u00b5g) and used only one type of adjuvant; further studies should vary both parameters to achieve better results. In addition, further studies should address several important issues. For instance, we need to clarify whether vaccination of pigs affects viral shedding and the viral load. Also, we need to examine effects on vertical and horizontal transmission. In other words, it is important to examine whether vaccinated pregnant sows can prevent transplacental transmission of CSFV to the fetus.",

Antibodies typically contains complex bi-antennary glycans whereas the heterogenous pFc2 may have high mannose type of glycans due to ER accumulation. N-glycans at CH2 domain influence the folding of the Fc part (Mimura et al. 2001). Therefore, it is possible that pFc2 can be recognized as antigen. Nevertheless, the vaccinated pigs hardly displayed adverse effects during the study. Highly sophisticated approach using glyco-engineering is required for minimizing autoimmune reactions and improved vaccine development based on Fc fragment.",
