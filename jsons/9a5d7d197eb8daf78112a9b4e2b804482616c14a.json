            "text": "The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 1,991,000 detected cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) illness worldwide and claimed more than 130,800 lives as at 16 April 2020 [1] . As rates of contact between individuals in different age groups under the current physical distancing measures are expected to depart considerably from the regular mixing patterns [2] , there is uncertainty regarding the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. While disease is most severe in older age groups, a sizeable share of COVID-19related hospitalisations in the United States and other countries occurs in individuals aged 20-55 years [3] . A study of close contacts of COVID-19 cases in China found comparable rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in different age groups [4] . South Korea employed one of the most inclusive testing practices for SARS-CoV-2 in the world, and the rate of detected cases in South Korea is highest in persons aged 20-29 years [5] .",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. Data published for week 14 were incomplete at the time when the analysis was performed. Having the later period to be week 13 alone rather than weeks 13-14 has a very minor effect on the results of the paper (Supplementary material). We assess relative changes in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases in different age groups in Germany using data on detected (reported) COVID-19 cases [8] . The ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case detection rate) in each age group may vary with time because of changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour and other factors. We believe that it is unlikely that the likelihood of seeking medical care/being tested increased substantially more for 15-34-year-olds than for 35-49-or 10-14-year-olds as the risk of severe disease is generally smaller in the former age groups compared to the latter. In addition, to address the possibility that testing practices during the early period focused on specific age or risk groups, we excluded week 9 from the early period and conducted sensitivity analyses (Supplementary material) with the early period assumed to be week 11 only (rather than weeks 10-11). In those sensitivity analyses, there was a further increase in RR for the 15-24 year age group, and the RR estimates in the 25-34 year age group remained higher than in age groups 35-49 and 10-14 years. All of this suggests that the observed temporal increases in the relative share of individuals aged 15-34 years among detected COVID-19 cases aged 10-49 years should be indicative of an actual increase in the prevalence of 15-34-year-olds among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population aged 10-49 years. In addition, data on mixing patterns in different age groups during regular times [2] suggest that those age groups are expected to have the largest role in driving the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Moreover, the age distribution of detected cases in South Korea [5] further supports our conclusion about the role of younger adults during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Finally, because it is possible that symptomatic older adults and younger children may be more likely to seek medical care/get tested compared with other age groups as the awareness about the epidemic increases with time, those age groups were not included in our analyses based on the RR statistic.",
