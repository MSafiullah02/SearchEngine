            "text": "With the rapid development of both computer hardware, software, and algorithms, drug screening and design have benefited much from various computational methods which greatly reduce the time and cost of drug development. In general, bioinformatics can help reveal the key genes from a massive amount of genomic data [1,2] and thus provide possible target proteins for drug screening and design. As a supplement to experiments, protein structure prediction methods can provide protein structures with reasonable precision [3]. Biomolecular simulations with multiscale models allow for investigations of both structural and thermodynamic features of target proteins on different levels [4], which are useful for identifying drug binding sites and elucidating drug action mechanisms. Virtual screening then searches chemical libraries to provide possible drug candidates based on drug binding sites on target proteins [5,6,7]. With greatly reduced amount of possible drug candidates, in-vitro cell experiments can further evaluate the efficacy of these molecules. In addition to virtual screening, de novo drug design methods [8], which generate synthesizable small molecules with high binding affinity, provide another type of computer-aided drug design direction. Artificial intelligence, e.g., machine learning and deep learning, is playing more and more important roles in the aforementioned computational methods and thus drug development [9,10,11]. In this review, we will focus on developments of the last four computational methods as well as their applications in drug screening and design.",

            "text": "Depending on the biological problems to be studied, multiscale models will be used in biomolecular simulations. The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM) (QM/MM) can be used to study the electronic properties [16], simulate chemical reactions (e.g., the enzyme catalysis mechanism [17]), and calculate spectra [18] in a single simulation, which can be used to elucidate the action mechanism of certain drugs. Another widely used biomolecular method is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [19,20,21,22,23,24], which applies empirical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields and is based on classical Newtonian mechanics. According to different accuracy requirements, all-atom (AA), united-atom (UA), and coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations as well as explicit/implicit solvent models, which allow simulations of temporal and spatial scales, can be used to facilitate the drug discovery [25,26]. Generally, MD simulations have been used for the identification of potential drug binding sites on target proteins, the calculation of binding free energy between target proteins and drug molecules, the action mechanism of drug molecules, etc. [27,28]. However, it is worth mentioning that MD simulations are also limited to time and length scales. Currently, AAMD simulations can explore time-dependent phenomena of large systems such as viral capsids in atomic detail as long as microseconds or even milliseconds [21,29,30]. Therefore, different types of simulation methods are required for different types of problems. Each of the different simulation methods has advantages, disadvantages, and practical limitations in terms of the size of system that can be simulated, the length of simulation that can be achieved, and the types of phenomena that can be modeled. On the other hand, improved algorithms, fast-growing data sets and computing ability are driving rapid advances in multiscale modeling methods which provide a powerful emerging paradigm for drug discovery.",

Moreover, multiscale biomolecular simulations can be used to reveal the action mechanism of a drug, which happens mainly on a molecular level, but clearly has macroscopic effects [32,33,34]. From the molecular structure level to cellular tissue, the dynamics of drug targets and the surprising complexity of biological systems challenge our scientific understanding. In order to reveal how changes at different levels are linked and interaction network, no single simulation method can solve all these problems involved. Multiscale simulation methods are designed to simulate and analyze cross-scale connections, for example, how one scale change leads to another scale change. An obvious challenge is the integration of data and simulation across length scales and time scales. The current multiscale approach has potential to overcome these limitations by directly combining different levels of descriptions, thus bringing new prospects for drug discovery.",

Here, we show applications of a combination of different methods to deal with complicated biological processes in this field. In recent years, although MD simulations are widely used, they still cannot consider the change of ionization states in simulated process. For example, MD simulations cannot discuss time dependence in a long time-scale of biological proton transport process, so the time dependence of protein changes with pH also cannot be revealed [35]. Therefore, in calculations and simulation process, it is necessary to combine the Monte Carlo (MC) approach (performed time-dependent simulations) in the proton transport process with the MD approach (performed pH dependent) in a protein model [35]. According to the electrostatic energy of the CG model, which can obtain the free energy of protonation states. In addition, the movement of the MC approach is based on the electrostatic energy of the CG model, and then proton transport time is used to make the scale, so as to correspond to the rate constant predicted by the transition state theory. Hence, they used isomorphism between probabilities obtained from the MC process and probability factors obtained from transition state theory [36], and converted the MC process to a time-dependent simulation with additional simplified modifications [37].",

Keeping in mind the complexity of cancers which show diverse phenotypes and multiple etiologies, a one-size-fits-all drug design strategy for the development of cancer chemotherapeutics does not yield successful results. Lately, Arjmand et al. [47] adopted a series of methods, such as the combination of X-ray crystal structures and molecular docking, to design, synthesize, and characterize novel chromone based-copper(II) antitumor inhibitors. In general, after obtaining the structure of the receptor macromolecule by x-crystal single-crystal diffraction technique or multi-dimensional NMR, molecular modeling software can be used to analyze the physicochemical properties of drug binding sites on the receptor, especially including electrostatic field, hydrophobic field, hydrogen bond, and key residues. Then, the small molecule database is searched, or the drug design technique is used to identify the suitable molecules whose molecular shapes match the binding sites of the receptor and binding affinity is high. Then, these molecules are synthesized and their biological activities will be tested for further drug development. In short, structure-based drug design plays an extremely important role in drug design.",

The theoretical basis is that the process of ligand and receptor recognition relies on spatial shape matching and energy matching, which is the theory of \u201cinducing fit\u201d. Determining the correct binding conformation of small molecule ligands and protein receptors in the formation of complex structures is the basis for drug design and studying its action mechanism. Molecular docking can be roughly divided into rigid docking, semi-flexible docking and flexible docking. In rigid docking, the structure of molecules does not change. The calculation method is relatively simple, and mainly studies the degree of conformation matching, so it is more suitable for studying macromolecular systems, such as protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013nucleic acid systems. In semi-flexible docking, the conformation of molecules can be varied within a certain range, so it is more suitable to deal with the interaction between proteins and small molecules [53]. In general, the structure of small molecules can be freely changed, while macromolecules remain rigid or retain some of the rotatable amino acid residues to ensure computational efficiency. In flexible docking, the simulated system conformation is free to change, thus consuming more computing resources while improving accuracy. What\u2019s more, the establishment of binding sites in molecular docking methods is very important. For the first time, Collins [54] successfully determined the binding sites on the surface of proteins using a multi-scale algorithm and performed flexible docking of molecules, which greatly promoted the development of molecular docking.",

When a drug molecule interacts with a target macromolecule, it produces a geometrically and energetically matched active conformation with the target. Medicinal chemists found that different chemical groups in drug molecules have different effects on activity, and changes to some groups have a great influence on the interaction between drugs and targets, while others have little effect [55]. Moreover, It was found that molecules with the same activity tend to have some of the same characteristics. Therefore, in 1909, Ehrlich proposed the concept of pharmacophores, which referred to the molecular framework of atoms with active essential characteristics [56]. In 1977, Gund further clarified the concept of pharmacophores as a group of molecules that recognize receptors and form structural features of molecular biological activity [57].",

Here, the importance of explicit molecular descriptors is shown in a model from a molecular structural point of view through QM calculations. With the assembly of reasonable molecular fragments, the objective of drug design method is to produce a certain novel molecule that display highest biological activity, absorption, metabolism, elimination (ADME) and lowest toxicity properties at different environments, which belong to the application range of QSAR models. The multiscale de novo drug design methods can efficiently handle a large amount of biochemical/clinical data and obtain the chemical characteristics in order to improve the properties of the drug molecule.

Although the QSAR model has been widely used in the search and design of new drug, classical QSAR models can only predict the activity and toxicity of one biomolecule against one certain target. However, the multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) can be used to carry out rational drug design at multiple targets, which provides a better way to understand various pharmacological characteristic molecules including antibacterial activity and toxicity. Furthermore, uniform multitasking models based on quantitative structure biological effect relationship (mtk-QSBER) have been used in a lot of researches. These models were built by ANN and the topological indices, which can predict the biological activity and toxicity correctly and classify the compounds in experimental conditions. Meanwhile, these models used perturbation models to form structural-activity relationships between the site of infection and the drug, such as the PTML model [85] and the ChEMBL model [86], which has been applied in infectious diseases [71], immunology [85], and cancer [87] widely.

Considering that cancer is a multifactorial disease, there is increasing interest in multi-target compounds that can target multiple intracellular pathways. However, the study of large data sets for the analysis of anticancer compounds is difficult, with a large amount of data and high data complexity. For example, the ChEMBL database [101] compiles big datasets of very heterogeneous preclinical assays. Bediaga et al. [87] have reported a PTML-LDA model of the ChEMBL dataset for the preclinical determination of anticancer compounds. PTML is a model that combines perturbation theory (PT) ideas and ML methods to solve similar problems. They compared this model with other PTML models which was reported by Speck-Planche et al. [72,102,103,104] and then concluded that this is the only one that can predict activity against multiple cancers. Speck-Planche et al. also derived a multi-task (mtk) chemical information model combining Broto Moreau autocorrelation with ANN from a dataset containing 1933 peptide cases. This model is used to virtually design and screen peptides with potential anti-cancer activity against different cancer cell lines and low cytotoxicity to a variety of healthy mammalian cells, and the model shows greater than 92% in both training and prediction (test)accuracy.",

It includes many phenomena that occur at various spatial scales from tissue to molecular length. The complexity of cancer development is manifested in at least three scales that can be distinguished and described by mathematical models, namely microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale. Wang et al. conducted a number of studies on how to use multiscale models for the identification and combination therapy of drug targets [105,106,107,108,109,110,111]. This method is based on quantification of relationship between intracellular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling kinetics, lung cancer extracellular epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation and multicellular growth. The multiscale modeling of tumors combined with systemic pharmacology will contribute to the development of practical smart drugs. It will produce a comprehensive system-level approach to determine the dynamics and effects of existing and new drugs in preclinical trials, model organisms and individual patients. In addition, mathematical and computational studies will provide a better way to understand many factors that influence the effects of drugs, thus helping to uncover better ways to therapeutically interfere with disease.",

PT models, on the other hand, allow us to predict the properties of a query compound or molecular system in an experimental analysis with multiple boundary conditions based on previously known reference cases.

However, the unique structure and proliferation of the virus pose a natural challenge for drug development. Viruses do not have their own cellular structure and metabolic system, and must replicate and proliferate in host cells. Therefore, it is difficult to find compounds that target only viral targets without affecting the normal function of host cells. At present, the main way that some antiviral drugs work is to inhibit viral replication. However, many of the tools used for virus replication come from human cells, such as ribosomes, and the corresponding antiviral drugs will also bring great side effects to the human body. Therefore, the discovery of drugs requires the introduction of a multi-scale model to screen out drugs that can inhibit viral replication while reducing the damage to the human body.",

ChEMBL manages big data capabilities through complex datasets, which make the information difficult to analyze because these datasets describe numerous features for predicting new drugs for retroviral infections. Without proper model, it is impossible to make full use of these features. Hence, V\u00e1squez-Dom\u00ednguez et al. [118] proposed a PTML model for the ChEMBL dataset, which can be efficiently used for preclinical experimental analysis of antiretroviral compounds. The PT operator is based on a multi-conditional moving average, which combines different functions and simplifies the management of all data. The PTML model they proposed was the first to consider multiple features combined with preclinical experimental antiretroviral tests. In order to simultaneously explore antibacterial activity against Gram-negative pathogens and in vitro safety related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity (ADMET), the Speck-Planchee et al. [119] further proposed the first mtk-QSBER model. The accuracy of this model in both the training and prediction (test) sets is higher than 97%. They also have developed a chemoinformatic model for simultaneous prediction of anti-cocci activities and in vitro safety [71]. The best model displayed accuracies around 93% in both training and prediction (test) sets. Additionally, focusing on exploring anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), the accuracy shown in the training and prediction (test) sets is higher than 95% using this model [120]. Cytotoxicity is one of the main concerns in the early development of peptide-based drugs. Kleandrova et al. [121] introduce the first multi-task processing (mtk) computational model focused on predicting both antibacterial activity and peptide cytotoxicity. Gonzalez-Diaz et al.
