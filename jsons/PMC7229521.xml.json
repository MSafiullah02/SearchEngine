Illinois, which borders Iowa, issued a stay-at-home order effective on the evening of March 21, 2020.4 The order also closed all nonessential businesses in that state.

The pre-period is from March 15 (when the first case was reported in those counties) to March 21. We performed a t test to test whether the \u03b21 equaled 0 at a significance level of P < .05. We estimated this model separately for 6 post-periods (each 5 days) from March 22 (the first full day with a stay-at-home order in Illinois) until April 20. County-specific fixed effects (\u03b8c) captured county time-invariant differences, such as population density and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, which should not change during the short study period. Day fixed effects (\u03c9t) captured daily changes in COVID-19 spread shared between Iowa and Illinois. The regression was estimated via least squares weighted by 2019 county population. We tested for homoscedasticity using a Breusch-Pagan test; the test rejected homoscedasticity at P < .001. Therefore, we estimated heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors.",

The second sensitivity analysis examined whether there were differential trends in COVID-19 cases by county population density and poverty rates, reported by census data,6 that may have confounded the difference-in-differences estimates.

Trends were comparable before the Illinois stay-at-home order became effective, supporting the difference-in-differences design. From March 15 to March 21 (on the evening of which the stay-at-home order became effective in Illinois), the average daily cases per 10 000 residents was 0.024 in the Iowa counties and 0.026 in the Illinois counties. After that, cases increased more quickly in Iowa. The difference-in-differences regression estimates also indicated a slower increase in COVID-19 cases in Illinois (Table 1). Within 10, 20, and 30 days after the enactment of the stay-at home order in Illinois, the difference in cases was \u22120.51 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.09; 95% CI, \u22120.69 to \u22120.32; P < .001), \u22121.15 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.49; 95% CI, \u22122.12 to \u22120.18; P = .02), and \u22124.71 per 10 000 residents (SE, 1.99; 95% CI, \u22128.64 to \u22120.78; P = .02), respectively.

Findings should be interpreted cautiously considering that possible differences in COVID-19 testing across the border may confound the difference-in-differences estimates. For example, Illinois had a greater increase in tests per 10 000 residents after the stay-at-home order (Figure 2). If state-level testing rates are representative of these counties, this would suggest that Iowa\u2019s testing rate was not higher during this period, and therefore the difference in testing would not explain the observed difference in rates per capita after the stay-at-home order. However, county-level testing trends may be different from state trends and may still confound the difference-in-differences estimates. As noted earlier, a meat-packing facility in Iowa had an outbreak, which increased surveillance. Whether stay-at-home orders affect the likelihood of such outbreaks and their spillovers into the community is an open question for future research.",
