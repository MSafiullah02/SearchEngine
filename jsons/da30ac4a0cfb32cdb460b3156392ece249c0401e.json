It does not replicate in and is not pathogenic for mice, guinea pigs, or rabbits, and this strain does not replicate in various mammalian cell lines. 3 Recently, we have established a system for expressing foreign genes. 4 In the present study, we constructed recombinant forms of the DIs containing the gene encoding four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S), of SARS-CoV either separately or simultaneously. Mammalian cells infected with the recombinant DIs synthesized SARS-CoV proteins that were recognized by SARS patient serum or rabbit antibody raised against synthetic peptides of SARS-CoV proteins in Western blot analyses. Intranasal or subcutaneous inoculations of BALB/c 3T3 mice with the recombinant DIs expressing E/M/S or E/M/N/S proteins elicited neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and protective immunity. Therefore, our study showed that the replication-deficient DIs strain is feasible as a safe and effective SARS vaccine.",

Concerning the M protein, only a smear band in the stacking gel was detected using a polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide of the M protein, 6 presumably because it formed large ologomers with SDS-resistance in cells. Similar result was observed by the analysis of the M protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. 7 The subcellular localization of the S, M, and N proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells infected with DIs-M or DIs-N showed that M and N proteins were localized mainly at the Golgi complex, which is consistent with studies with model corona viruses in which it was found that M is retained in the Golgi apparatus. 8 S protein was localized at the Golgi complex but the plasma membrane was also stained, suggesting that some portion of S protein was transported to the plasma membrane. Thus, these results indicate that cells infected with recombinant DIs under the control of the mH5 promoter express significant levels of SARS-CoV proteins with an expected post-translational processing.",

We next estimated the neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV of antisera obtained (Table 1) . Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV were induced in mice that were either subcutaneously or intranasally injected with DIs-S, -E/M/S, or -E/M/N/S. Among them, the highest level of the neutralizing activity was observed in sera of mice injected subcutaneously with recombinant DIs expressing E, M, N, and S. On the other hand, we could not detect neutralizing activity in sera of mice injected either subcutaneously or intranasally with recombinant DIs expressing M or N proteins. Thus, these results indicate that recombinant DIs induces potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies. It appears that the S protein is prerequisite for eliciting a sufficient level of IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity.",
