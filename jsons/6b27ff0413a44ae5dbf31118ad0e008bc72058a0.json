            "text": "Despite recent advances, our knowledge of potential and rare human pathogens is far from exhaustive. Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Enterovirus) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.",

HTS techniques (also termed next-generation sequencing, NGS) can directly identify genetic markers of unknown infectious agents in a pool of NAs from biological samples without using classical time-consuming virological or microbiological methods. However, total NA sequencing is not used in routine infectious disease diagnostics because of certain limitations. The genetic markers of a pathogen usually account for only a few reads among a huge number of background host-related sequences (human/animal and non-pathogenic environmental bacteria) 7 .

            "text": "Rapidly evolving methods in molecular diagnostics face limitations associated with extremely high genetic diversity of viruses. Furthermore, most of the global virome remains undiscovered, resulting in a lack of reference sequences for novel pathogen identification. One way to overcome this situation is by developing a system, which allows specific enrichment of unknown virus content in processed biological material based on known homologous sequences. We were able to increase viral cDNA content for two distinct flaviviruses (YFV and JEV) by hybridization of HTS-ready libraries with pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Comparison of the genomes of these viruses (KF907504 vs KF297915, respectively) using BLASTn shows a 66% identity level at 27% of the genome coverage. The hybridization oligonucleotides showed no preference towards YFV and JEV in the enrichment experiment. The data set for the oligonucleotide design included over 100 highly diversified flavivirus sequences, therefore, comparable enrichment efficiency may be expected for any known flavivirus. To further test the specificity range of the method, we tested whether it was possible to enrich the cDNA of one virus genus with hybridization probes designed for another genus of the same family. Indeed, it was possible to enrich the content of enterovirus cDNA using an oligonucleotide designed to to the FMDV virus (79.2% sequence identity between the FMDV oligonucleotide and the enterovirus). The Enterovirus and Aphthovirus genera are very distantly related within the Picornaviridae family. Therefore, the specificity breadth of the method goes beyond a genus and could cover distantly related genera within a highly diversified virus family. Importantly, cDNA enrichment by hybridization lacks theoretical specificity limitations typical of PCR, such as the strict requirement of the precise match of the three 3\u2032-end nucleotides of the PCR primer. Any small number of additional mismatches in any part of the hybridization oligonucleotide will only reduce hybridization efficiency, but not completely prevent it. Therefore, this approach is theoretically more robust in terms of sequence variation than genus-specific PCR with degenerate primers. Moreover, the degeneracy of the probes (the number of possible unique oligonucleotides within a degenerate oligonucleotide preparation) was between 2 12 and 2 46 , thereby greatly exceeding the maximum degeneracy of 2 8 , which is acceptable in a PCR primer.",

Even a standard library preparation procedure results in the uneven amplification of genome fragments 28 . As expected, this bias was further deepened in our protocol. Therefore, it is advisable to use several hybridization oligonucleotides per taxon. On the other hand, using specifically designed degenerate probes, which are complementary to conserved genome regions, is much more affordable than synthesizing multiple specific oligonucleotides to the whole genome, as suggested earlier 18 .",

The cDNA libraries containing human and YFV or human and JEV genetic material were hybridized with three pan-flavivirus biotinylated oligonucleotides (Flavi-8469, Flavi-8844, Flavi-9834). The library containing human and E11 genetic material was hybridized with FMDV-specific biotinylated oligonucleotide.Hybrid selection was performed similarly to a previously published method24 with minor modifications. Briefly, a 20 \u00b5L mix containing 1X hybridization buffer (0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer: pH 7.0, 0.5% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 1xSSC, 2xDenhardt's solution), biotinylated oligonucleotide(s) (final concentration: 20 nM each), 1 \u00b5g Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), 50 uM oligonucleotide Nts1_SpC3 (5\u2032 CTG TCT CTT ATA CAC ATC TGA CGC TGC CGA CGA spC3 3\u2032), 50 uM oligonucleotide Nts2_SpC3 (5\u2032 CTG TCT CTT ATA CAC ATC TCC GAG CCC ACG AGA C spC3 3\u2032) and 3 \u00b5L of an amplified cDNA library was heated at 97 \u00b0C for 5 min. Next, the mixture was slowly cooled to 47 \u00b0C (3 \u00b0C every 10 min). After 15 h at 47 \u00b0C, the hybridization mixture was added to 100 \u00b5g of M-270 streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen), which had been initially processed as follows: the beads were washed twice in 150 \u00b5L of a buffer containing 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA, then incubated in 14 \u00b5L of a solution containing 1X hybridization buffer, 2.2% casein (Stereospecific Detection Technologies GmbH) and 100 mg/L of Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C, and then resuspended in 80 \u00b5L of a buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl and 6.25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).",
