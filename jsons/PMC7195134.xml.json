In addition, whilst there was published guidance from PHE on the collection and handling of diagnostic samples, local variation in laboratory testing methods, may have added to the uncertainty felt by HCW. Diagnostics is a vital part of managing a pandemic, allowing early detection and isolation of cases and freeing up of resources following identification of negatives.
