However, its field efficacy is limited to 39% among children with uncomplicated malaria and 29% in severe malaria cases and only protective against P. falciparum [2]. The field efficacies of vaccine against P. falciparum, the deadliest species of malaria parasite, have been significantly hampered by genetic polymorphisms in candidate antigens. These polymorphisms alter the epitope expression leading to loss of vaccine efficacy [3], hence vaccines designed with sequence compositions identical to the infecting parasites can offer protection against infections by such parasites [4, 5].",

Epidemiological survey of genetic diversity associated with P. falciparum at study sites for vaccine trials is utilized in molecular identification of prevalent genetic variants of vaccine candidate proteins [4]. Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding-like protein family (PfRH) has been in the focus for vaccine development because it is a key determinant of erythrocyte invasion [9]. Plasmodium falciparum Rh comprises of five members: PfRH1, PfRH2a, PfRH2, PfRH4 and PfRH5. PfRH5 is currently a promising vaccine candidate antigens fast approaching clinical development [9]. Most of the clinical manifestations in malaria is as a result of erythrocyte invasion, which is a complex process involving merozoite attachment to red blood cell (RBC), re-orientation, tight junction formation and parasite entry into the RBC. The receptor PfRH5 on the RBC is Basigin (CD 147).",

To differentiate the parasites based on clonal origin, oligonucleotide primers (MSP2-OF:5\u2032-ATGAAGGTAATTAAAACATTGTCTATTATA-3\u2032 and MSP2-OR: 5\u2032-CTTTGTTACC-ATCGGTACATTCTT-3\u2032 for the primary reaction. The secondary reactions involved: FC27-OF:5\u2032-AATACTAAGAGTGTAGGTGCARATGCTCCA-3\u2032 and FC27-OR: 5\u2032-TTTTATTTGGT GCATTGCCAGAACTTGAAC-3\u2032, IC/3D7M2-F: 5\u2032 AGAAGTATGG-CAGAAAGTAAK CCTYCTACT-3\u2032and IC/3D7M2-R:5\u2032-GATTGTAATTCGGGGGATTTGTTCG-3\u2032 from published sequences in the GenBank [13], were used to amplify the block 3 of MSP-2 in nested-PCR. The conditions for the primary reactions were an initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles consisting of 1 min of denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C, 2 min of annealing at 55 \u00b0C, and 2 min of extension at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The same cycling conditions were used for the secondary PCR (Nest 2) reaction except that the extension in the cycle was for 1 min. The DNA regions were amplified in 50 \u00b5L reaction mixtures containing: 1.25 U PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA), 1\u00d7 polymerase reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM dNTPs and 1 \u00b5M of each primer. Each amplification with conserved or family-specific primer pair being done separately as previously described [14], using 2 \u03bcL of 5 ng/\u03bcL DNA sample. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels, and DNA bands visualized with the gel documentation system (Infinity 3026, Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, France) after ethidium bromide staining. The sizes of the fragments obtained were estimated by comparison to the 1.3 Kb (100 bp) DNA ladder (Jena Bioscience GmbH, Germany) as marker in comparison with standard purified genomic DNA from 3D7 laboratory strains similarly electrophoresed.",

The relative binding ability of the different peptides to specific MHC molecule were assessed. The peptide concentrations that leads to 50% inhibition, IC50, were taken.

A total of 5 non-synonymous SNPs were found in the populations studied described as: K62R, T81Q, P197S, C203Y and H240R with the mutation C203Y being the most prevalent with 74.87%.

IURs are important targets of host immune system, including antibody recognition. Disordered epitopes are usually smaller, but more efficient and sensitive to epitope sequence variations [24]. It is therefore imperative to identify population-specific polymorphic immunological hotspots within the disordered antigen\u2013antibody interface from our study population. Although C203Y mutation was most frequent, only one of the codons (197) within the PfRH5\u2013basigin interface was observed to be polymorphic. These findings show a high level of conservation of PfRH5 in comparison with the expectations for a protein with such critical functional role. However, the presence of polymorphisms in the predicted immunologically important peptide requires further attention to understand the impact on the effectiveness of PfRH5-based vaccine.",
