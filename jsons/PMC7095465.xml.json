            "text": "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan [1], Hubei province, China, and then spread throughout the country. At present, growing cases have been found in other countries with a rapid growth rate, and the world moves closer toward worldwide spread of the virus [2]. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (EDCD) had raised the risk infection level of COVID-19 from medium to high for its severe situation [3]. The virus spread rapidly from person to person through the droplets of respiratory and close contact, and everyone can be infected [4]. The common clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. Old men with comorbidities are more likely to have severe or even fatal respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [4]. In our department, four highly suspected patients with COVID-19 underwent [18F]-FDG PET/CT in January 2020 [5]. PET and SPECT are routine examinations for clinical diagnosis of various diseases and appropriate protective measures should be carried out during this epidemic.",

Furthermore, the patient should be scheduled as the last one of the day, in order to avoid cross infection. All patients and accompanying persons must wear a protective mask during the entire examination. It is important to try to shorten the examination time and limit the patients\u2019 activities.",

If special treatments (such as sputum aspiration and specimen collection) are performed in an emergency, upgraded protections for respiratory and eyes are necessary [7]. The operating table, instruments (SPECT, SPECT/CT, PET/CT and PET/MR), and the environment must be cleaned and disinfected promptly.",

In non-endemic areas, it is also necessary to recognize and classify all patients, verify the history and clinical symptoms of every patient.
