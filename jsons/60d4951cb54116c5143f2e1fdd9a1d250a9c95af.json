Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak. Previous studies have explored on this topic in various culture settings with SARS ( Lau et al, 2003; Brug, Ar, Oenema, de Zwart, Richardus, Bishop , 2004; Wu et al, 2009 ), pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (Rubin, Aml\u00d4t, Page, & Wessley, 2009; Yeung, Lau, Choi, & Griffiths, 2017; Bayham, Kuminoff, Gunn, & Fenichel, 2015; Lau, Griffiths, Choi, & Tsui, 2020) , and influenza A(H7N9) (Wang et al, 2014; Wu et al, 2015; Wu et al, 2014) . Cultural differences are evident in public responses (Cheng, & Tang, 2004; Vartti et al, 2009 ) Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings (Lau et al, 2003; Brug et al, 2004; Lau et al, 2020; de Zwart et al, 2009 ).",
