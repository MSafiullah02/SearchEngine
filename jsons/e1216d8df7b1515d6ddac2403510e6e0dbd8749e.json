Generally, populations are characterized by its commun ity structures and by the heterogeneous distributions of weak ties among nodes bridging over communit ies. A strategy for commun ity networks capable of identifying influential spreaders that accelerate the spread of disease is here proposed. In this strategy, influential spreaders serve as target nodes. This is based on the idea that, in k-shell deco mposition, weak t ies and strong ties are processed separately. The strategy was used on empirical networks constructed from online social networks, and results indicated that this strategy is mo re accurate than other strategies. Its effectiveness stems fro m the patterns of connectivity among neighbors, and it successfully identified the important nodes. In addit ion, the performance of the strategy remained robust even when there were erro rs in the structure of the network.",

In the case of networks with broad-degree distribution (Barabasi and Albert 1999) , the degree strategy for the well-connected individuals has been shown to be an efficient method of identifying efficient spreaders (Cohen et al. 2001; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani 2001) . Betweenness is another centrality strategy. It involves measuring the nu mber of shortest paths that cross the current node. It has been used to determine who has the mo st influence on others in networks (Freeman 1978; Goh et al. 2003) . However, Kitsak et al. pointed out that the most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of a network as targeted by the k-shell decomposition strategy rather than targeted by degree and betweenness (Kitsak et al. 2010) . Th is method is based on iterative pruning of nodes with degree smaller than or equal to the k-core index of the current layer until each node is associated with k-core index that reflects the core or periphery layer in netwo rk (Carmi et al. 2007 ).",

It serves an important function in the dynamics of epidemic (Liu and Hu 2005; Wu and Liu 2008; Huang et al. 2006 ). In the presence of community structures, heterogeneous distribution of the number of weak ties was observed among real networks, such as air traffic networks (Gu imera et al. 2005) , social networks (Arenas et al. 3 / 22 2010) , and commun ication networks (Onnela et al. 2007 ). The weak t ies (Granovetter 1973 ) connecting a pair of nodes belonging to different co mmunities have been found to provide shortcuts fro m one community to another (Gong et al. 2011 ). These ties have been proven to be more efficient in diffusing diseases through network (Hebert-Dufresne et al. 2013) . Identify ing the influential spreaders in community networks is quite challenging because the mesoscopic features of the community structure are co mplex (Gong et al. 2013) . Here, a k-shell with community strategy is proposed. This strategy, based on the idea of the k-shell deco mposition process, involves identifying the influential spreaders using weak ties and strong ties . Results demonstrated that the proposed strategy performs better in empirical networks than degree, betweenness, and k-shell deco mposition strategies do. Simulation also shows that this strategy has the merit o f being significantly robust against noise.",

Here, the susceptible infected recovered (SIR) with identical capability of act ive contacts model was used to compare the performance of d ifferent identification strategies (Zhou et al. 2006) . In the SIR model, each node in each network represented an individual who could be in one of three states: susceptible, infected, o r recovered, and each link between nodes represented one connection that could spread an infection. Initially, all nodes were susceptible. To initiate an infect ion, one node was randomly chosen and considered infected. Each step and every individual had same infectiv ity A = 2, in which every infected individual generated identical contacts, mult iple contacts to one neighbor we re allowed, and the probability that a given susceptible node would be in fected was \uf062\uf020= 0.5. The probability that an infected node would recover was \uf067\uf020= 1. Once an individual was recovered, there would be no further change. In the simu lation, states of every node were updated synchronously. The dynamics ended when all in fected recovered.

Briefly, degree strategy was based on the idea that most influence nodes would be those with the largest number of connections, and it is one measure of local influence: only the structure around the node has to be considered (Latora and March iori 2007) . Betweenness measures the number of shortest paths fro m all nodes to others that cross through that node. Kitsak et al. argues that the structure of network organizat ion serves an important function such that there are plausible circu mstances under which the most degree or highest betweenness as influential spreaders have the least pronounced impact on the spreading process (Kitsak et al. 2010 ). K-shell decomposition is one strategy based on iteratively pruning of nodes with degree no more than k-core index of the current layer. The highest k-core index is closely related to the concept of most influential nodes on spreading process. They used the strategy by identifying the core and periphery of given node in real network to id entify key spreaders and found that k-shell deco mposition strategy is more accurate. In fact, under real-world conditions, such as those in world wide air traffic network and emp irical networks (Gong et al. 2013; Gu imera et al. 2005) , the heterogeneous distribution in the number of weak t ies among nodes indicated a pronounced difference in the spreading process. Unfortunately, this issue was not taken into account in the process of k-shell deco mposition.",

In summary, the k-shell with co mmun ity strategy proposed here was studied for effectiveness. There is one strategy for identifying nodes . This strategy is based on the idea that k-shell deco mposition involves both weak and strong ties . The current strategy was used to emp irically tested networks among students in U.S. universit ies constructed by using online social networks. In most cases, the current strategy were found to be more effective in identifying influential spreaders than other methods, such as degree, betweenness , and k-shell decomposition strategy for the range of the set, and results were more accurate. Its effectiveness can be attributed to the neighbors identified by our strategy because the pattern of connections among neighbors was more striking than those produced using other strategies. For th is reason, it can spread through the entire network more quickly and effect ively. The current method kept its stability well throughout the missing processes, and has also been strongly performed robustness.",
