The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA enclosed in a trilaminar capsid and encodes six structural (VP1\u2013VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1\u2013NSP6) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007, Gentsch et al., 2005, Parashar et al., 2006). Due to the segmented nature of the genome, GARVs can undergo genetic reassortment if two different GARVs of the same group co-infect one cell (Estes and Kapikian, 2007, Gentsch et al., 2005, Parashar et al., 2006).",

The VP7 and VP4 outer capsid proteins independently elicit neutralizing antibody responses and are used to classify GARVs into G (for glycoprotein) and P (for protease-sensitive) types (Ciarlet and Estes, 2002, Estes and Kapikian, 2007, Glass et al., 1997). Currently, 23 G and 31 P genotypes have been described for GARVs of humans and animals (Abe et al., 2009, Ursu et al., 2009). As many more reassortant or new genotypes are predicted to appear, continuous monitoring of circulating rotaviruses is important for improving regional epidemiological information and updating the vaccine strains.",

The ages of the pigs tested from these provinces ranged from 3 to 70 days old. The fecal samples were examined for common bacterial enteric pathogens including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella spp. using specific agar media. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae was detected by PCR with the specific primers B.hyo nest3 (5\u2032-CTGCTGCCTTCTTCATAAAT-3\u2032) and B.hyo nest 5 (5\u2032-AAGAATGGGTATTGTTGCTG-3\u2032) (La et al., 2003). For the extraction of viral RNA, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared immediately by diluting the feces 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The suspensions were then vortexed for 30 s, centrifuged (1200 \u00d7 \ng for 20 min), and then the supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until needed.",

In this study, two-thirds of the VP7 and VP4 genotypes were comprised of G5 and P[7] genotypes, respectively. The other G and P genotypes including G8, G9, P[1], and P[23] were a minority of the VP7 and VP4 genotypes. However, G3, G4, G11, P[6], P[13], P[19], and P[26] genotypes, which were known to be common, were not detected in this study. It is unclear whether the data in this study exactly reflected the true prevalence of G and P genotypes in the field farms due to the difficulty in cultivating some rotaviruses in cell culture (Zaberezhny et al., 1994). For example, P[6] porcine GARVs are quite common in nature, but are not usually cultivatable (Martella et al., 2006, Zaberezhny et al., 1994). Since we analyzed only cell culture cultivated porcine GARV strains, future studies should use the fecal samples for G and P genotyping of porcine GARVs to generate a more accurate picture of GARV genotypes in South Korea (Zaberezhny et al., 1994).",

The discovery of these G8 GARVs is important to the swine industry, veterinary practitioners, and GARV vaccine producers in South Korea. It should be noted that the serotype G8 is one of the major bovine serotypes in combination with P[5] and P[1] genotypes (Alfieri et al., 2004, Chang et al., 1996, Fukai et al., 2004, Gentsch et al., 1992). In addition, G8 GAVR serotype has been detected in rare cases in humans (Adah et al., 2001, Cunliffe et al., 1999, Fischer et al., 2003, Matthijnssens et al., 2006, Palombo et al., 2000, Steele et al., 1999), and pigs (Gouvea et al., 1994). Among the G8 GARVs, one strain contained bovine-like P[1]-VP4 gene, indicating bovine-like G8P[1] strains can infect heterologous species in nature, such as pigs. The remaining 16 G8 strains contained the porcine-like P[7]-VP4 gene. This result implies that reassortant events between porcine and bovine GARVs occur in nature. In previous reports (Ha et al., 2009; Park et al., unpublished data), we demonstrated that reassortant GARVs between bovine and porcine, and heterologous GARVs whose 11 genome segments are of pig origin infect calves and induce diarrhea. Therefore, interspecies transmission of GARVs between bovine and porcine, either as whole virions or by gene segment reassortment, appear to occur in nature at a relatively high frequency in South Korea.",

From mid-1990s, G9 GARVs reemerged and efficiently spread throughout the world as the fifth globally important serotype (Ramachandran et al., 2000, Santos and Hoshino, 2005). Recently, G9 GARVs have been classified into I\u2013VI lineages, with I\u2013II consisting of strains isolated in the 1980s, and III\u2013VI composing of strains isolated from the mid-1990s (Phan et al., 2007). Of these, lineages III and VI were found in both humans and pigs (Phan et al., 2007). In the present study, G9 GARVs were isolated and identified as the third most important genotype in the diarrheic pigs. All Korean strains were clustered in lineage VI of known porcine and human G9 GARVs. Thus, continuous genotypic characterization of the GARVs and cautions against the increase of the G9 is necessary in South Korea. Moreover, human G9 GARV infections belonging to lineage III have been emerging in South Korea since 2002 (Kang et al., 2005), meaning that Korean porcine G9 GARVs are different from Korean human G9 GARVs.",

This may be related to the influence of low relative humidity as a factor facilitating the survival of GARVs on surfaces (Brandt et al., 1982). Studies describing the seasonal pattern of porcine GARVs in diarrheic piglets have rarely been published, and those published data varied widely (Will et al., 1994, Svensmark et al., 1989). In one of the few comparable studies, the seasonal curves of porcine GARV infections were highest in winter and the slightly higher in late summer and early autumn in Iowa, USA (Will et al., 1994). In contrast, Danish porcine GARV infections showed a slight increase during the autumn (Svensmark et al., 1989). In this study, however, porcine GARVs occurred throughout the year with the highest prevalence during the summer months. The reason for the seasonal pattern variations around the world is not yet known. Therefore, more intensified epidemiological studies throughout the world will be needed to fully understand the seasonal pattern of porcine GARV infections and to establish porcine GARV surveillance programs to prevent infections.",
