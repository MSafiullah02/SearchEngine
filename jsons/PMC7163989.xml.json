They are secreted in special cells, in secretion ducts or cavities or in glandular hairs from which they are extracted by distillation (water\u2010steam or hydro\u2010distillation), pressing, enfleurage, solvents or by supercritical fluid extraction.1 In general, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (CG\u2010MS) is used to determine the chemical composition of EOs. It is well known that EO composition is influenced by many factors, e.g. environmental conditions, soil type, plant part, chemotype of plant species, isolation process, etc.,2 which determine its biological activity.",

            "text": "Because of the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria and the growing antibiotic resistance to them many research groups have focused their research programmes on investigating the antimicrobial activities of plants and their extracts in the hope of discovering new antibiotics. Therefore, the number of publications about the in vitro antimicrobial activity of EOs has been dramatically increasing, in most cases without any innovation. It has been previously demonstrated that the oxygenated terpenoids in EOs, e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, peroxides, and phenols, are responsible for strong antimicrobial activity and influence bacterial growth.3\nIn vitro studies about antimicrobial activity of EOs describe a wide range of assays, e.g. disc diffusion, agar diffusion, broth dilution, etc., with different parameters (bacterial or fungal strains, agar recipes, incubation time, solvents, etc.) thus their results are difficult to compare with each other. In most cases their reliability is questionable. Because of volatile and non\u2010water soluble properties of EOs, the common screening methods (e.g. disc diffusion or agar absorption) are not appropriate for their antimicrobial testing. Hood et al.4 compared the results of different methods used for determination of antimicrobial activity of EOs. The authors concluded that the disc diffusion method does not provide true results because only the more water soluble components diffuse into the agar medium. The broth dilution method is mostly acceptable but the Tween concentration used for enhancing the solubility of EOs must be taken into consideration, because it may increase bacterial growth or alter cell permeability. Tween may show antagonistic or synergistic effect with EO resulting in lower or higher antimicrobial activity. Therefore, it is highly important that the parameters of our methods will be optimized before investigations are carried out to produce reproducible antimicrobial results of EOs.",

This number was 6% in the female group and 5% in the male group.5 In 2012, pneumonia was responsible for 13% of causes of death among post\u2010neonatal (1\u201359 month) children.6 Based on WHO data, LRTIs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have remained the top major killers during the past decade.7 Although WHO has a well\u2010organized global vaccine action plan against most bacteria or viruses causing RTIs, many people suffer from influenza, pneumonia or tuberculosis and without proper treatment these diseases can kill many people worldwide. EOs may possess a preventive role in the treatment of RTIs. The application of EOs via inhalation seems to be the most effective way to cure patients, because of their volatile nature they can reach the site intended to be treated.8\n",

As the illness persists the sputum may become purulent. Acute bronchitis is mainly caused by viruses but in 40% of cases bacterial infection is responsible for the symptoms.10\nIn chronic bronchitis excessive mucus production leads to coughing up sputum on most days during at least 3 consecutive months for more than 2 successive years.11 Patients with chronic bronchitis can suffer from acute flare\u2010ups of infection. This illness is mainly caused by pathogenic bacteria, e.g. non\u2010encapsulated H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cigarette smoking and inhalation of fumes or dust are also relevant contributing factors.\nBronchiolitis is the inflammation of the smaller diameter bronchiolar epithelial surfaces and mainly develop during the first 2 years of life. The characteristic symptoms include wheezing, hyperinflation, cough, runny nose, rapid breathing, and respiratory distress. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for 40% to 80% of bronchiolitis cases showing marked seasonality (during winter and early spring).9\n\nPneumonia is the inflammation of the LRT involving the lungs and supporting tissues. It is a dangerous infection, because it can easily lead to the patients\u2019 death. There are two major categories of pneumonias: community\u2010acquired pneumonia and pneumonia associated with hospital, ventilation or health care. The pathogenesis of pneumonias is complicated, and organisms can cause infection in many possible ways (e.g. by upper airway colonization or aspiration of organisms). Pneumonias are mainly caused by viruses (e.g. adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza, varicella, rubeola, or RSV), but after primary infection, viruses can inhibit host defence mechanisms leading to a secondary bacterial infection. In general, fever, chills, chest pain, and cough suggest pneumonia, but 10% to 30% of patients complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and myalgias.9 It should be highlighted that the aetiology of acute pneumonias is strongly dependent on age. More than 80% of pneumonias in infants or children are caused by viruses, whereas less than 10% of pneumonias in adults are viral.9\n\n",

In the study performed by Bouhdid et al.43 the activity of cinnamon EO (CEO) containing 73.3% of E\u2010cinnamaldehyde was investigated against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The cell membrane permeability of P. aeruginosa was more disturbed after CEO treatment than in the case of S. aureus. However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that in the presence of CEO S. aureus entered in a viable but nonculturable state. In this state the virulence potential of bacteria is preserved and the cycle of infection will restart when bacterial cells recover their full metabolic capacity. This fact must be taken into consideration when EO activity is evaluated. Previously, our workgroup had demonstrated the effect of CEO and clove EO (CLEO) on outer membrane protein (OMP) composition of P. aeruginosa.44 The oils were administered to the culture at concentrations of 0.5 x MIC and 2 x MIC and incubated for 60 min. Some proteins disappeared after the treatment of CEO and CLEO. Decreases in the amount of some proteins may be explained by the protein synthesis inhibiting effect of these oils. We received similar results to the study published first by Burt et al.45 The mode of antimicrobial action of EOs is highly related to their chemical composition.41, 42 For example, in a study aromadendrene as the main compound of Eucalyptus globulus oil (EGO) showed higher MIC value against P. aeruginosa than the 1,8\u2010cineole\u2010rich EGO.46 Aromadendrene having cyclopropane ring can cause alkylation of proteins, and results in their altered conformation.47 Furthermore, the chemical change (e.g. oxidation) of EO components may contribute to their antibacterial action.35 Oxidation of citral, d\u2010limonene and \u03b1\u2010pinene in air has been already experienced and their \u2018products\u2019 contributed to higher antibacterial action.48, 49\n",

Antimicrobial drugs often have a high price and side effects while the EOs are relatively cheap and safe natural materials. The application technique of these substances is variable depending on the symptoms of the disease and the treated area. The commonly used method is inhalation which can be divided into active and passive techniques. Active inhalation means that patients use an inhalation device or patch from where they can directly inhale the volatile components. EOs can be used with passive inhalation as well, when the EOs are applied into the environment via heating, vaporization or forced air ventilation.89, 96 An old\u2010fashioned and the cheapest way for relieving the symptoms of respiratory diseases is vapour inhalation over a bowl of hot water containing a small amount of eucalyptus oil (EUO). The inhalation could be effective with the application of a towel over the head because in this case we could directly inhale the concentrated aromatic components.97\n",

The simple use, lower price (compared to plastic inhalers) and disposable hygienic form are the advantages of this device.

The flexible inner part contains fibrous material (e.g. cotton) saturated with an aromatic substance (e.g. EO). A cap closes the inner part including a flip nozzle, which operates between defined positions and permits release of effective aromas when the patient inhales. In a closed position the nozzle confirms that the vapour of the EOs cannot escape when the inhaler is not used.

Firstly, the small sample size may limit the interpretation of results. Secondly, short periods of treatments (e.g. 3 days) are not sufficient for the interpretation of results, as well. Another limitation is associated with the safety use of EOs. However, in some cases investigators did not observe any severe side\u2010effects, but larger\u2010scale studies should be designed in order to conclude the safety application of EO formulas. In addition, it is difficult to perform a double\u2010blind trial including EO or its individual constituent.
