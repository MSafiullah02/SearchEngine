However, there are some major differences as follows: (1) Queries on cQA forums are much longer than queries and questions on FAQ pages. In fact, often times, cQA queries have a subject and a body [29]. (2) cQA forums have a user network. Thus every QA pair is associated with a set of users. Unlike that, when ranking QA pairs from FAQ pages, we cannot exploit signals from any user network. (3) cQA pages typically have a question but multiple user-voted answers. FAQ pages have no user-voting, and only one answer per question. (4) On cQA forums, different answers may apply based on user context. On FAQ pages, every question has a unique answer.",

Recently, transformer based networks [24] have shown significant gains across many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of transformer network based methods like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [6] and Multi-task Deep Neural Network (MT-DNN) [15]. Further, we propose a novel architecture, MMT-DNN, based on a masking trick specifically applicable to input in the form of (query, question, answer) triples. To make such models practically usable, we need to reduce the model size as well as the execution time. Hence, we propose an improved knowledge distillation method for our MMT-DNN model. Our experiments with two datasets show that the proposed model outperforms all the baselines by significant margins. Also, our distilled 174MB MT-DNN-3 model provides a runtime of mere 31 ms making it usable in real-time chatbot scenarios. We make the following main contributions in this paper.",

For SymBiMPM [7], the authors used query-question label as the label for a (query, question, answer) triple. As a refinement, we first considered only those QA pairs where question-answer label is \u201cgood\u201d, and then used the label for query-answer similarity as the label for a (query, question, answer) triple. Also, queries in the SemEval-2017 set have a subject as well as a body. Gupta et al. [7] simply used the query subject and ignored the query body. We experiment with just the query subject as well as with query subject + body. Table 2 shows that using query subject + body usually provides better accuracy, sometimes with a large margin. We also experimented with QCN [29] but the results were worse than even BiLSTMs. This is expected due to mismatch in the problem setting, as discussed in Sect. 2. Further, Block B shows results for the proposed methods. As the table shows, our proposed methods outperform existing methods by a significant margin. All results are obtained as a median of 5 runs. Both BERT and MT-DNN benefit from finetuning across the two datasets. Also, MMT-DNN outperforms all other methods by a significant margin (p < 0.05 using McNemar Test [16]), establishing a new state-of-the-art for FAQ answering task.\n",

Overall the proposed techniques lead to models with high accuracy, and small runtime and model size.",
