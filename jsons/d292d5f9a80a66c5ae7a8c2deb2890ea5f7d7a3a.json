Despite this well-established link-including empirical support for shared etiological and functional connections between SUP and PTSD -the field has been void of a gold standard treatment for adolescent populations. To address this gap, our team recently completed a large randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT), an integrative and exposure-based risk-reduction and treatment approach for adolescents who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the design and methods of this RCT designed to reduce SUP, PTSD symptoms, and related risk behaviors, with outcomes measured from pre-treatment through 18 months post-entry. Specifically, the recruitment and sampling procedures, assessment measures and methods, description of the intervention, and planned statistical approaches to evaluating the full range of outcomes are detailed. Clinical and research implications of this work are also discussed.",

Evidence-based treatments have been developed and evaluated for treating pediatric PTSD and depression among adolescents who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events through individual, office-based approaches [12] . Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) [13] , an exposure-based treatment that teaches youth and caregivers skills for managing trauma-related behavioral and emotional problems, is the most widely-disseminated pediatric trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment, with an abundance of RCTs to support its safety, efficacy, and effectiveness with trauma-related mental health concerns [12, 14] . Existing treatments for adolescent SUP emphasize teaching youth new cognitive and behavioral skills for responding to internal and external substance use cues and often involve the caregiver in establishing contingencies for achieving and maintaining substance use reductions (e.g., CBT, Motivational Enhancement Therapy with CBT, Multisystemic Therapy [MST], Contingency Management, etc.) [15] . Among youth who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events, substance use may result from feelings of distress in relation to trauma cues and expectancies that using substances will help the young person cope with such distress.

One hundred twenty-four cases were urn randomized to condition (described below in detail) and 11 of these cases were not randomized bur rather assigned to a specific condition either because they had a sibling already enrolled in the study (and a family could not receive both treatments due to contamination factors) (n = 2) or because of case load issues (e.g., if therapists in the control condition were on a wait list and the RRFT clinician had several open slots, it was preferable not to have the participant wait to receive treatment and thus were assigned to RRFT or vice versa) (n = 9). See CONSORT diagram (Insert Figure here) . Participants randomized to the experimental condition were assigned to a therapist who was trained and supervised in RRFT. Participants randomized to the control condition received Treatment as Usual (TAU). These treatment conditions are described in greater detail below (see Interventions).",

To keep assessors blind to condition, participants were urn randomized to the RRFT or TAU conditions by a trained CAC staff member (not a study clinician) using this program immediately following completion the baseline assessment. Specifically, once the Research Assistant screened and consented a new participant entering the study, she or he provided the necessary information to the CAC staff member to enter into the urn to produce the condition assignment. Specifically, condition assignment was balanced based on pre-treatment PTSDs severity (score on UCLA-PTSD-RI [24] [25] [26] \u2265 38), frequency of pretreatment substance use (\u22654 substance using days over past 30 days); and the gender of the adolescent. Once the condition was identified, the CAC staff member informed the PI and the TAU supervisor of the condition assignment.

For example, the youth and caregivers work with the therapist to determine what maintaining factors (\"drivers\") contribute to a given risk behavior at each level of their ecology (e.g., substance use as a coping strategy; low parental monitoring; substance-using peers) and how those drivers can be modified to reduce substance use and promote emotional resilience (e.g., teach positive coping skills, involve other family members or neighbors for monitoring, connect the youth with structured activities that provide a forum for meeting non-using peers).",

According to this theory, fear is acquired through a classical conditioning process by which the individual pairs a neutral stimulus (e.g., the dark; a certain word/smell) with a stimulus that invokes a fear response (e.g., sexual assault) -such that the neutral stimulus elicits the fear/distress response in the absence of the feared stimulus. Change occurs through exposure therapy, as individuals can reduce a fear response during exposure to the feared stimuli without the feared aversive consequences. Based on its adaptation from TF-CBT, RRFT includes gradual exposure therapy to address PTSD symptoms via the development of a detailed written or verbal account of the IPV experiences and other traumatic events. As part of this exposure-based trauma narrative work, cognitive-behavioral therapy also is involved, where the therapist helps adolescents identify and replace inaccurate and/or unhelpful beliefs that they have developed in relation to the traumatic events (e.g., \"I am damaged goods\"; \"The abuse was my fault\"; \"I am unlovable\"; \"Being high is the only way to deal with what happened.\") Skill-building in the area of coping (e.g., emotional reactivity) is an important preamble to the exposure work and is accomplished by teaching distress tolerance and relaxation skills.",

Therapists are encouraged to engage in brief phone or SMS/text check-ins with families between sessions to promote treatment engagement, particularly when new skills have been taught or during times of family crisis. Duration of treatment is not fixed in RRFT; rather, treatment is ended when the youth and family's goals have been met.

Tapes were coded using the Family Therapy Scale from the Therapy Procedures Checklist [38] , which is an assessment of techniques used in session (e.g., improving family communication patterns), and an RRFT Therapist Adherence Measure (RRFT-TAM) [39] . The RRFT-TAM was developed using guidelines from the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing [40] and accompanying Rasch methods [41] . Because RRFT represents an integration of TF-CBT for PTSD and MST for SUP, the RRFT-TAM was designed to capture key features of those models. Finally, caregivers also completed the Services Assessment for Child and Adolescent [42] at the final assessment point to report on a wide range of services that had been accessed over the course of participation in the study.",

First, to establish a long-term collaborative relationship with families, assessments were scheduled at the family's convenience, contacts were as friendly and personalized as possible, and families were reimbursed for their participation in each assessment session. Second, at consent, we requested up to eight phone numbers of the caregivers' and adolescents' best friends, closest relatives, and places of employment to facilitate contact each time the family is assessed; we also asked if participants had plans to change their place of residence. Third, we received consent to reach the adolescents (and caregivers as applicable) through text messaging and social media in addition to phone and mail. Fourth, direct contact with the families helped to maintain the cohort, as all families were tracked monthly for therapist adherence and school placement reports. When possible, participants were followed by the research assistant responsible for the initial research interview, which promoted rapport and a sense of involvement. The research assistant administered the assessment battery in each family's home or at the CAC, based on the participant's preference and availability. To compensate for their time, families were paid $70 for completing the intake interview and $50 for each subsequent assessment. Data from all timepoints were collected on all families who were randomized into the study, even if they dropped out of treatment.",

            "text": "The statistical analyses will follow intention-to-treat methods, with youth and caregivers included in the randomly assigned condition independently of their participation in the clinical intervention. The data are structured with five repeated measurements (level-1) nested within participants (level-2). To address this, the primary statistical models will be implemented as mixed-effects regression models [61] , with continuous outcomes analyzed according to a normal sampling distribution and discrete outcomes analyzed using Bernoulli (dichotomous), negative binomial (count), or ordinal (ordered categories) sampling distributions. Primary outcomes focus on substance using days and PTSD symptom severity, with secondary outcomes targeting marijuana use and marijuana using days, alcohol use and alcohol using days, and polysubstance use (i.e., the use of at least two different substances). Sexual risk behaviors, as measured by the Sexual Risk Behavior Scale [56] , are secondary outcomes that will be evaluated as well. To model change over time, polynomials and/or time-related indicators will be entered at the level of repeated measurements. For instance, by including linear and quadratic polynomials, the model would estimate an instantaneous rate of change that, over time, can slow down or speed up. Alternatively, more basic formulations, such as the use of dummy-coded indicators for the post-baseline assessments, could test for change between baseline and each subsequent assessment occasion. The effect of RRFT will be tested using a dummy-coded indicator for intervention condition (0 = TAU, 1 = RRFT), which will be entered at participant-level along with cross-level interactions between condition and the level-1 time term(s). Significance testing will be based on the Wald test (i.e., \u03b2/SE), and tests that are not directly provided by this formulation (e.g., the significance of within-group change for RRFT) will be obtained using planned contrasts. A number of potential control variables will be considered. For instance, at level-1, an indicator may be included for treatment status at each measurement occasion. This would test for an overall shift in the level of the outcome [43] socioeconomic data, and family composition AC Chart Review of information from Intake Interview Semi-structured interview to assess lifetime history of IPV and IPV incident characteristics [44] A C Substance use and abuse Timeline Followback (TLFB) [23] Type, quantity, and frequency of non-tobacco substance use over past 90 days A Urine Drug Screens [45] The urine toxicology screen to validate TLFB self-report A Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (C-DISC) [46] Diagnosis of Axis I disorders AC",

That is, although significant progress has been made in treating trauma-related psychopathology among adolescents and in treating SUP among adolescents independently, significantly less is known about treatment of SUP and PTSD in an integrative fashion among adolescents who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events.",

Given that post-treatment substance use relapse rates are high, including among youth [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] , assessments that extend to the year following treatment are critical in determining whether gains are indeed maintained after treatment. A substantial strength of the Stage II trial was that it included 12-and 18month post baseline assessments to determine if indeed RRFT was successful in targeting long-term improvements in SUP and PTSD symptoms, as well as sexual risk behaviors.",

Prior to the Stage II study, a Stage Ia feasibility trial [20] and a Stage Ib pilot RCT [18] evaluating RRFT have been completed. The Stage I work resulted in a treatment manual, a clinician training protocol, and a quality assurance system. The results from these prior studies were promising, indicating that RRFT can be readily learned and implemented with fidelity, and that it can lead to improvements in drug use, drug use-related risk and protective factors, PTSD symptoms, and HIV sexual risk behaviors. The first outcome paper for the current trial indicates that the results hold true for SUP and PTSD symptoms.",

First, this study focuses on a 'real world' population of adolescents-where the focus was on heterogeneous symptoms (e.g., current substance use, PTSD symptoms), rather than requiring meeting full diagnostic criteria (e.g., severe substance use disorder + PTSD diagnosis). This ensures the study results will generalize to a broader population of youth who are highly vulnerable for the wide range of negative sequelae that can follow IPV and other traumatic event experiences. The multi-faceted clinical needs of this population call for an innovative solution to bridge the gap between early intervention and treatment, resulting in an inclusive risk-reduction approach with the potential for a wider-spread impact. Second, establishing an integrative treatment option for this population directly addresses issues related to client burden (having to navigate separate, parallel or sequential treatments for SUP and PTSD delivered by different therapists in different settings) and clinician preferences [72] to have tools to address the multi-faceted problems most representative of their clients. Third, the Stage II trial affords a unique opportunity to pursue mechanisms of action research, which can direct improvements to treatment models and inform important next steps in this line of research. As noted in the Methods, we assessed several empirically-informed skills specifically targeted in RRFT (e.g., emotional regulation; parenting) that may lead to improvements in SUP and PTSD.",
