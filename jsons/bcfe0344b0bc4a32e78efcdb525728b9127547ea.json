We will first explore some outmoded 'taken for granted' assumptions and visions: this section aims to clarify why the crisis management world has profoundly changed and how the current understanding of crises and theoretical frameworks is becoming increasingly less adequate. Then, we will try to meet the second challenge of this special issue, by suggesting innovative approaches that will contribute to elaborate the building blocks of a theory of crisis management. We will propose a new theoretical framework, through the use of a fractal approach, following the footsteps of Benoit Mandelbrot, in order to rethink and capture the essence of the new theatre of operations that must be dealt with. Throughout, we will show how this original framework could be put into practice and what its limitations and perspectives are.",

A dominant tendency is just to ignore such improper outbreaks, and to concentrate on the 'normal' game plans.Yet, some bold thinkers -philosophers, doctors, strategists, lawyers, mathematicians and economist -have always been captivated by such strange quirks of 'nature' and history. Ever since the ancient Greeks, 'crisis' has received special attention: how to envision and deal with such difficult trials sent by the gods or nature? The quest has always been seen as foolish: how to study the exception to the rule, the 'irrational'? And dubious too: those studying such disturbances were incapable of providing a clear definition of their elusive 'object'.And probably blasphemous into the bargain: you do not question the gods nor the laws of nature and science. In a sense, the very idea of a 'theory' of crisis appeared and still appears as a contradiction in terms, both inconsistent and suspect (B\u00e9jin & Morin, 1976) .",

In the late 1970s, and increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s, the field was opened up to take stock of the new kinds of shocks that impact complex technological societies, beyond natural disasters alone. A profusion of severe turbulences were examinedinternational shocks, factory explosions, product tampering, prison protests, urban riots, football stadium tragedies, train or plane hijackings, specific financial crises, etc. Case studies multiplied and sustained efforts were made to consolidate theoretical perspectives and models (Rosenthal, Charles, 't Hart, 1989; Lagadec, 1993) . In parallel, much was done to clarify number of 'best practices' to deal with these events and their ripple effects (Fink, 1986; Ten Berge, 1990) . Many disciplines were mobilized to open up new lines of thought and to lend their support to the development of knowledge. Yet a lingering plea was made to consolidate, beyond mere case studies, some better 'theory' of crisis.",

More radical still: electronic media coverage is now totally in real time, globally. During the top secret operation against Bin Laden, the news of the attack was already on Twitter as the core strategic group was following the assault from the West Wing war room; during the shootings in Liege (Belgium, 14 December 2011), one tweet said that the gunman was in police uniform: and one sees the crowd fleeing from the police, the police not being aware of that item of news.",

Judgment becomes crucial. Fundamental values also become part of the problem, and elusive when called upon to ground a given analysis, decision or implementation.

There is something pathetic in this frantic race. The demands to be satisfied in order to secure a degree of recognition are in effect essentially incompatible with the substance of the crisis phenomenon and the kind of intelligence it requires. As the issue of crises becomes increasingly more strategic, it is urgent to understand and to establish as a founding principle the fact that crisis studies cannot satisfy the requirements of classical theoretical models. Crisis studies must not beg for recognition by simply trying to play into paradigms that are not and cannot be theirs; they must open their own fields and routes.

Such a preliminary confession appears to be essential to acquiring a kind of scientific royal warrant. Take, for example, James A. Robinson, who scathingly opens his article 'Crisis' in the International Encyclopedia for Social Sciences with: ' \"Crisis\" is a lay term in search of a scholarly meaning' (Robinson, 1968, p. 510) .The bill of indictment is well known: a term 'gutted from within' (Morin, 1976, p. 149) , an 'empty shell, a ready-to-use catch-phrase' (B\u00e9jin & Morin, 1976, p. 1),'a convenient clich\u00e9' (Starn, 1976, p. 13) ,'a vulgar and hollow little word' (Morin, 1976, p. 163) ;'a very useful word in the age of mass media' since 'it creates emotion without requiring reflection'. (Starn, 1976, p. 13) . Nothing here is all that new. Historian Randolf Starn points out that as early as 1860, an Italian lexicographer decried the abuse of the medical term 'crisis' (Starn, 1976, p. 7) . However, such accusations and regrets are not false, especially with the growing importance of the mass media, so fond of the little word. As Mike Granatt (2011) put it recently: 'The word \"Crisis\" has replaced \"Emergency\" just because it is shorter, hence a much better fit for the media format'. But it is necessary to go beyond these basic condemnations: they tell us more about the limits of our understanding of crises than about the intrinsic limits of the concept itself.",

It is to misinterpret them ontologically. When crisis management experts call for agreement on the definition of basic terms, in effect, they are committing the same kind of error that we accuse practitioners of making when they ignore the complexity of crises' Inherently, the crisis field is the world of the ill-structured, the intractable and the 'wicked'. Even if it is useful to explore, find and use formulations that help to shape and consolidate approaches of the crisis phenomenon, it is necessary to state a preliminary and basic condition:'crisis' will resist any attempt to be 'defined'.

The conventional view is that crisis develops when risk control has failed, when 'residual risks' have taken their toll. The good news is that the whole is clearly measured, with probabilities. And crisis lies in a residual territory, limited in essence. The new theatre of operations in the risk domain compels us to step outside of this vision of 'residual accidents'.The ingredients of a new vision are pointed up, but with caution, in Bernstein's (1996) 'Remarkable story of risks'.The conquest of the crepuscular territory of risks has been extraordinary throughout the centuries but many 'details' that could have been ignored in the past now rush back to centre stage as we enter a much more complex, turbulent, volatile world. Dice throwing follows regularities . . . 'if the dice is honest' (Cardano, p. 45) . Nature follows regularities, but . . . 'only for most of the part' (Leibnitz, p. 4). 'Players can anticipate processes, as long as . . . they stick to the rules upon which they agreed at the outset.' (Pascal, p. 67). The issue is that such difficulties, marginal in a stable, controlled and compartmentalized world, are capable of overwhelming the whole landscape in a globalized, volatile and turbulent world.

Crisis theorists cannot develop their endeavour through normalization but only through invention. Crisis is a specific 'object', which demands a specific, different, theoretical universe. But cognitive habits, academic recognition constraints, the difficulties of any discovery process and probably above all,the great ordeals that accompany any exploration of the unknown -'It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built' (Einstein,in Kuhn,1962,p.83 ) -tend to lead to 'normal thinking' rather than invention. An illuminating example of such recoil has been given in a book recently written on the subject of cataclysmic risks.The author of one of the chapters rightly underlines that, for such off-scale risks, it would be necessary to change our paradigm; but his whole contribution is strictly embedded in 'normal science, normal knowledge'. He explains: 'The challenge of existential risks to rationality is that, the catastrophe being so huge, people snap into a different mode of thinking. . . . I thought it better that this essay should focus on the mistakes well documented in the literature -the general literature of cognitive psychology, because there is not yet experimental literature specific to the psychology of existential risks' (Yudkowsky, 2008, p. 114) .",

One must go beyond top-down and bottom-up; simply because as information gets diluted and transmitted along the decision chain, it gets distorted and reinterpreted. The specificity of a crisis event is the amount of distortion that a 'piece of information' (in its broad meaning) can suffer: during a crisis event, one piece of information is received differently by the actors (partial transmission, mutation, distortion, etc.) and every single actor interprets it differently based on his local reality and acts differently.

The ideas underlying Mandelbrot's mathematical work can be effectively used to better describe modern crises as analogous to fractals, and the underlying invariance principles can be mapped into well-known effects in crisis management. Yet beyond Mandelbrot's own work, the crucial advance offered by fractal theory is the possibility to envision, capture and handle very unstable, blurred and hypercomplex states of the world.",
