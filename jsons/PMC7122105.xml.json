The most relevant ones are hepatitis A and E, enteroviruses, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and enteric adenoviruses, which may cause the respective severe diseases: hepatitis, paralysis, meningitis, myocarditis and heart anomalies, fever, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, and respiratory disease (Fig. 35.1).\n\n",

Categorically, studies have shown that waterborne viral disease outbreaks occurred when the following elements were involved: (a) consumption of untreated surface water; (b) consumption of untreated groundwater; (c) insufficient or sporadic water treatment; (d) faulty public distribution network; and (e) miscellaneous (sewage irrigation, contaminated food, aerosols, etc.).

            "text": "Frequently, somatic coliphages have been selected from a heterogeneous group of different families\u2019 morphology such as Myoviridae (i.e., phage T4), Siphoviridae (i.e., \u03bb phage), Podoviridae (i.e., phage T7), or Microviridae (i.e., phage \u03a6X174) (Table 35.2). Somatic coliphages contain a double-stranded or a single-stranded DNA (ds/ss DNA), encapsulated in a proteinaceous isometric or elongated capsid. One of their major features is the tail (contractile or not), except for Microviridae (lacking a tail), that help in infection by attachment to a certain receptor (typically part of a protein, a lipopolysaccharide, the peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, or an exopolysaccharide) on their E. coli host\u2019s outer membrane, E. coli C being the most commonly used as the host (Armon et al. 1988). Other additional hosts have been also reported, such as E. coli B, C, C-3000, F-amp, and K-12 derivatives, such as WG21 and W3110, plus several undesignated strains of E. coli. However, most of these hosts have restriction enzymes capable of inactivating the invading phages, except E. coli C, which does not own a DNA-modifying or restricting system, explaining the high efficiency of plating with somatic phages. Attachment and infection via a receptor located on the E. coli cell\u2019s outer surface imparted their collective group name \u201csomatic coliphages.\u201d Somatic coliphages are regularly found in human sewage and are more prevalent than F+ RNA coliphages in marine water and warm waters (Moc\u00e9-Llivina et al. 2005; Lovelace et al. 2005; Burbano-Rosero et al. 2011). These bacteriophages show frequent occurrence in human and animal feces (102\u2013108/g) and wastewater (103\u2013104/ml), and good environmental persistence, although they are readily inactivated by water treatment processes, with the exception of a few types (Hot et al. 2003; Moc\u00e9-Llivina et al. 2005). Kott et al. (1974) found that somatic coliphages were present in wastewater and other fecally-contaminated waters in numbers at least equal to human enteric viruses. Coliphages have been used as water quality indicators for estuarine, sea, fresh, potable, and waste waters, and biosolids (Moc\u00e9-Llivina et al. 2003; Sinton et al. 1999), and as indicators of enteric viruses in aerosols from activated sludge, sewage effluents, shellfish, and shellfish-growing water (Fannin et al. 1977; Vaughn and Metcalf 1975), and found to have several limitations. Among these limitations are: their potential multiplication in the environment, as pointed out by many authors (Vaughn and Metcalf 1975; Seeley and Primrose 1980; Parry et al. 1981; Borrego et al.\n1990; Grabow 2001); poor correlation of coliphage and enterovirus densities (Nieuwstadt et al. 1991; Wommack et al. 1996); the inability of several coliphages to indicate the presence of solid-associated infective viruses (Moore et al. 1975); the inverse correlation of coliphages and enteric viruses with temperature (Geldenhuys and Pretorius 1989); presence of autochthonous bacteriophages in unpolluted waters (Seeley and Primrose 1980), and finally, host strain variability (Havelaar et al. 1986). Justification for the use of somatic coliphages as sentinels of enteric viruses in wastewater suffers from another potentially important but critical limitation. From the infectivity point of view, this phage group is not specific only to E. coli species. There is evidence that somatic coliphages may multiply in other species of the family Enterobacteriaceae that comprise the total coliform group (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Hafnia, Klebsiella, and Escherichia spp.) often found associated with vegetation and biofilms and not restricted to fecal sources. Of these bacteria, the two most common species are Klebsiella pneuomoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (Souza et al. 1972). Therefore, it is possible that somatic coliphages may be produced/present while being unrelated to fecal contamination, and therefore, unrelated to any health risk. Consequently, the use of somatic coliphages as indicators of fecal pollution and enteric virus presence has serious shortcomings and should be considered as such. Muniesa et al. (2003) studied the factors affecting somatic phage replication using E. coli strain WG5. They concluded that there is little chance of somatic coliphages replicating in environmental waters, although it cannot be ruled out completely. The host bacteria and phage threshold densities used by these authors were greater than the highest densities of somatic coliphages and host bacteria reported in most human and animal raw wastewaters. Therefore, they concluded that there are few natural environments in which the densities of non-replicating host bacteria and their physiological status could support somatic coliphage replication. They also concluded that the ratio of phages to bacteria will not be affected by replication in water, and consequently, the likelihood of somatic coliphage replication is very low outside the animal gut. This potential replication could be affected by several factors, such as the densities of host bacteria and phages, the physiological condition of host bacteria, the dissolved and suspended solids in water, ambient temperature, other bacteria present in water, and additional factors. The replication potential of somatic coliphages in water environments has been considered as a weakness of using somatic coliphages as appropriate viral indicators in water.\n",

The pilus is an appendage type, present on the surface of bacterium male strains, encoded by an episomal F-factor. The F-factor is a DNA sequence or plasmid that confers on certain bacteria the ability to produce a sex pilus for conjugation with other bacteria. The F-factor can consequently occur as an independent plasmid. However, it can also integrate into the bacterial genome or chromosome. Hence, bacteria may be classified in relation to the F-factor as HFr (high frequency of recombination) when the F-factor is DNA-integrated or F+ when separate, both states conferring on a bacterium the so-called \u201cmale property.\u201d\n",

One of the main features of these phages is their environmental multiplication only at temperatures > 30 \u00b0C, which is attributable to bacterial pilli formation (male hosts) that occurs only at > 30 \u00b0C. These phages also have a relatively high resistance to environmental stresses, such as disinfectants, sunlight, salinity, heat treatment, and water and sewage-treatment processes (Havelaar and Hogeboom 1984; Havelaar and Nieuwstad 1985; Armon et al. 2007). However, according to their indicator role they have several drawbacks, such as: (1) serotypes may be related to the human/animal origin of fecal pollution; (2) their excretion is not always in sufficiently large numbers to be easily enumerated; and (3) the F+RNA coliphages are infectious to bacteria that possess the F-plasmid, and this F plasmid is transferable to a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, a transferability that raises concern over the lack of E. coli specificity (Sobsey et al. 1995).",

            "text": "It should be emphasized that up to the present time, the only universally accepted indicator of enteric viruses presence in water are still E. coli bacteria or, as most laboratories call them, fecal coliforms. As previously presented, E. coli is a universal inhabitant of the human gut, excreted in large numbers in feces reaching our sewage. Indeed, the numbers are high enough to be detected easily, but they have a prominent disadvantage: the fecal coliform does not survive well in the environment (e.g., in seawater) and sewage treatment processes (including disinfection), and therefore, as compared with enteric viruses, the E. coli indicator is a very fragile one and will decline first. This major problem that tormented environmental virologists for decades has been ameliorated since the 1970s and even earlier, when bacteriophages of different bacteria present in human feces were suggested as better viral indicators (Kott et al. 1974; Armon and Kott 1996). Indeed, bacteriophages seem to fulfil the major prerequisites of viral indicators due to their viral resemblance, fecal excretion, and survival capability characteristics. Table 35.3 summarizes the numbers and/or presence/absence frequency of the three bacteriophage groups isolated from various water sources. From our personal experience and based on others\u2019 research, it can be stated that certain bacteriophages can be useful as viral indicators under certain conditions. For instance, the bacteriophage host should be selected from a certain human population, i.e., gut flora can differ between different populations and countries, as previously revealed for the B. fragilis host, which is suitable mostly in Europe but not in North America. In the USA, Bacteroides fragilis phages were not detected in large numbers in sewage when the Spanish B. fragilis HSP40 bacterial host was used for phage detection (Sobsey and Kator, personal communication, 1997). It may be possible that, for bacteriophage detection in a certain geographical area, it will be necessary to isolate primarily a well-defined bacterial host. Furthermore, for each type of water contamination, we should look at one or several groups of bacteriophage types in order to define a certain correlation with sewage or fecal pollution.\n",

It is our opinion that, similar to the case of the coliform/fecal coliform indicator, in the case of which it was decided to include certain bacterial families as well as to apply a highly defined group, such as fecal coliforms (usually referred to as thermotolerant E. coli), as a more specific indicator, bacteriophages will require similar fine-tuning in order to fulfill their real role as indicators.",

Havelaar et al. (1993) emphasized this idea by showing that F+-male specific RNA phages are an adequate model for enteric viruses in fresh water. However, even this publication excluded raw and biologically treated sewage, due to lack of correlation between the presence of these phages and enteric viruses. Kamiko and Ohgaki (1993) substantiated the results of Havelaar et al.

            "text": "Unquestionably, improvement in bacteriophage detection and host specificity will result in a better correlation between their levels and those of various pathogens present in polluted water. However, despite our recent and future progress, we should narrow the definitions of indicators according to the degree of pollution and its presence. In brief, the bacteriophage groups that have been related to a certain pollution criteria and found to correlate with the presence of human pathogens do not need to correlate with the same pathogen in a different pollution environment or in a different geographical area. The ubiquity that we seek so intensively in order to adapt it for guidelines is perhaps the main pitfall in reaching the right conclusions. An excellent example for the above assumptions is the B. fragilis bacteriophage group: the bacterial hosts used in Spain for their specific phages is B. fragilis HSP-40, resulting in good phage detection from human fecal wastes, while B. fragilis RYC2056 detects phages in both human and animal fecal wastes (Puig et al. 1999). For example, on the global scale, the B. fragilis RYC2056 host showed good results, while B.fragilis HSP40 showed geographic variability, as mentioned earlier (high counts for Southern Europe, Israel, South Africa versus low counts for the USA, Sweden, and the UK). Chung et al. (1998) showed that B. fragilis VPI3625 used in USA was similar in its plaquing efficiency to B. fragilis RYC2056.",

Finally, a recent publication theoretically suggested the use of the Torque teno virus transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route in humans (based on the presumption that this enteric virus is \u201cubiquitous in humans, elicits seemingly innocuous infections, and does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations or epidemic spikes\u201d) as an appropriate indicator of viral contamination of drinking water (Griffin et al. 2008). Still, this theoretical proposition preeminently emphasizes the major indicator challenge: (1) it needs to be tested, including in terms of densities and occurrences, including spatial and temporal stability; (2) a viral assay and infectivity test has yet to be developed; and (3) determination and correlation along real enteric pathogenes!",
