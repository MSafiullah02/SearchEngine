            "text": "The challenges of combating the novel Coronavirus pandemic have put a halt to many economic and socio-cultural activities in many societies across the globe. On the other hand, it has triggered an avalanche of scientific research, both within and outside the medical domain, in order to help communities overcome this challenge by minimising its adverse impacts. The enormity of these scientific efforts and the speed at which the knowledge on this topic has been generated pose significant difficulties for everyone to stay abreast of these developments. In an effort to address this challenge and to help better organise these emerging and rapidly developing scientific outcomes, in this short review, we conduct a macro-scale analysis of the scientific literature on Coronaviruses in general, as well as the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in particular. We also more closely examine the literature published on COVID-19 with safety components to identify the dimensions of research that have so far been addressed by the scientific community with respect to safety. Apart from the significance this may have to curb the impacts of the current crisis, a holistic view on what safety dimensions are relatively well covered scientifically and which have so far attracted less academic focus, can be instrumental to direct future research efforts. Scientifically analysing and understanding the various safety implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as widely as possible can furthermore help societies to be better prepared for future pandemic outbreaks, and ultimately support informed decision-making in light of societal values.",

            "text": "Research on Coronaviruses in general dates back to 1960\u2019s and the literature on this topic is quite well established. The sub-domain of this academic field of research focusing on COVID-19, however, is understandably just an emerging and fast developing field. In Section 2, we discuss the method by which the bibliometric data related to these segments of the literature has been obtained. It will be shown through the macro-level analysis of this literature in Section 3 that, within the last two decades, each major outbreak of a Coronavirus has been immediately followed by a quick surge in the number of scientific studies on the topic and a slow gradual decline afterwards. However, the surge of studies triggered by the latest outbreak, i.e. that of COVID-19, appears to be the largest of all by far, which may be a reflection of the magnitude of the crisis that this new disease has caused. Studies from various disciplines \u2013 far beyond medicine and immunology as central fields to understand and mitigate the disease itself \u2013 have already emerged on this topic. This includes fields within social sciences, environmental sciences, psychology and veterinary sciences (Decaro et al., 2020), and many more. Clearly, safety has been a distinct focus of interest among these studies. As the micro-level scoping analyses of this work in Section 4 demonstrate, at least ten major dimensions of safety research can be identified that have so far attracted the attention of the scientific community. The scholarly efforts on these safety dimensions and their findings and recommendations are synthesised here to help further invigorate academic investigations into the safety impacts of this pandemic. This can be important for informing policies in the face of this emergency. Section 5 concludes the findings while also identifying and discussing a selective list of potential safety-related dimensions with respect to this pandemic that are currently underrepresented in the scholarly domain. These may warrant further attention by the safety research community as the scale and scope of this crises become clearer, not in the least to facilitate wider understanding of the various safety implications as a basis for improved societal preparedness and response to future pandemic outbreaks.",

This tool implements the visualization of similarities approach (Waltman et al., 2010) and is widely used in the wider academic and safety science literature to map clustered networks of authors, journals, collaborating countries, and co-citations. Moreover, VOSviewer also implements text mining algorithms to identify noun phrases from title and abstract of the publications, from which networks, clusters, and heatmaps can be constructed (van Eck et al., 2010). In Section 3, VOSviewer is used to map journal networks of the literature on Coronaviruses and COVID-19, as well as term clusters and heat maps of frequently occurring terms in these datasets.",

The search included the title, abstract, and keywords of the articles. This search resulted in a total of 41 articles which were individually studied and filtered out depending on the extent of their relevance to safety research. Among those, 34 items were deemed relevant.

Three clear spikes in the number of publications can be observed: one in 2003 (followed by another year of increased number of publication and then a gradual decline), one in 2013 (again, followed by another year of increased number of publication and then a slight decline), and the last one in 2020. The fist spike coincides with the SARS (Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002 and 2003 (Dodd and Stramer, 2020, Law et al., 2020). The second one is attributable to the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2012 (Sheng et al., 2020), which reinvigorated the scholarly attention to Coronaviruses. Evidently, the last spike follows the current COVID-19 outbreak. Figure 1 (d) and (f) respectively illustrate the authors and journals with greatest number of publications on Coronaviruses. The Journal of Virology has published by far the most items on this topic, with journals such as Virology, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology following at a considerable distance. The figure also shows that the top-10 journals all focus on virological and medical topics.",

Figure 2\nillustrates the outputs of this analysis. The bibliographic networks visualised in Figure 2 through heat maps associated with each topic are based on the number of the references that publications of each source share with each other on each of the two topics of interest. Two journals are bibliographically coupled when their documents published on our topic of interest cite one or more document(s) in common, and the higher the number of their shared references, the stronger their coupling relationship. The more intensely the red shade corresponding to the journal name, the more dominant the journal as a knowledge outlet. The spatial closeness between journals corresponds to the number of references that publications of those sources share in each database.

The terms human* and Coronavirus infection* and viral pneumonia (including their variations, humans, Coronavirus infections and pneumonia virus) appear to be the most frequently used terms in the title and abstracts of publications on COVID-19. The fact that COVID-19 is from the family of the Coronaviruses has a clear reflection on the key terms of the publications with Coronavirus being also a top term. The relation of the virus to China as the geographical region where the outbreak began has also been reflected in the key terms with China being one of the most used terms.",

The red cluster from Figure 5(a), which addresses aspects of biomedical sciences, is comparatively younger, while the green cluster, focusing on the public health implications, is comparatively the youngest. This suggests a scientific progress of discovery and study of Coronaviruses amongst animals, followed by viological, microbiological, genetic epidemiological, and medical studies, and finally clinical work and studies on public health. The fact that there is a sizeable body of academic literature on Coronaviruses, as observed from Figure 1(c), with significant knowledge of their various biomedical aspects available since about 2005 as seen in Figure 7, gives hope that clinical treatments for COVID-19 are attainable.",

In doing so, many studies have synthesised the scientific evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of various treatments based on experiences obtained from previous pandemics of similar nature, such as SARS and MERS. Highlighting the high degree of genetic similarity between SARS-COV and COVID-19, an overview by Chen et al. (2020d) outlines various vaccine development programs and different vaccine technologies that are currently being examined based on experiences with SARS. They emphasise that these vaccine strategies need to be evaluated for their safety and efficacy, with specific consideration for issues specific to vaccination of vulnerable populations such as elderly and those with debilitating chronic conditions. A considerable amount of scientific efforts is focused on the development of treatments, concerning which several studies appeared on the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and its variants such as hydroxychloroquine (Liu et al., 2020a) as potential treatment for COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020, Devaux et al., 2020). The study of Cortegiani et al. (2020) is a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. It reflects the evidence from the ongoing clinical trials and suggests that the current promising evidence justify more clinical research into this potential treatment. Devaux et al. (2020) also suggest that the preliminary trials of chloroquine in China have been promising in terms of both safety and efficacy, which has led to several new trials.",

The study of Schwartz and Graham (2020) reviews the published data on epidemiological and clinical effect of SARS and MERS and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. They provide recommendations for including pregnant women in the design of COVID-19 vaccine trials. Based on a retrospective review of the clinical records of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, Chen et al. (2020a) suggest that the clinical characteristics of these patients were similar to those non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19. They furthermore find no evidence of vertical transmission from pregnant women to their infants who develop COVID-19 during late pregnancy. The study of Rasmussen et al.

To mitigate the risks involved in the transport of suspected COVID-19 cases, there have been models of care that avoid face-to-face contact between clinicians and patients which can also reduce the risk to the medical professionals. The method of video consultation has been discussed by Greenhalgh et al. (2020), who provide evidence from randomised trials showing that video consultations have been associated with high patient and staff satisfaction, lower care cost, and no significant difference in disease progression. They however highlight that such evidence underrepresents cases of patients with acute and potentially serious illness such as COVID-19. They compare the benefits and potential downsides of video consultations, in particular in relation to the COVID-19 disease.",

For example, the study of Kooraki et al. (2020) reviews precautions and safety measures specific to radiology departments in relation to dealing with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. These recommendations are meant to help manage the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the department and staff in the radiology departments and are thus also related to the topic of occupational safety. They argue that this requires a multidisciplinary committee to convene and outline such safeguarding guidelines. From a different perspective, Nie et al. (2020) discuss the biosafety considerations involved in the handling of the pseudo-virus for Coronaviruses. This requires level 3 biosafety facilities, which the authors highlight as one of the obstacles on the way of vaccine development. Consequently, they propose a series of pseudo-virus-based neutralisation assays and protocols for SARS-COV-2 which are safer and can be handled in biosafety level 2 facilities.",

They argue how this pandemic has exposed gaps in the social safety net in the United States and discuss how through a series of actions, Medicaid programs could play a key role in protecting the public and supporting public health efforts in the battle with this pandemic. These recommendations cover dimensions such as the flexibility to maintain or increase enrolment, expanding the options to cover tele-visits, removing berries to billing related to diagnosis and treatment, expanding home-based care coverage, easing limits on prescription drugs, and assisting special segments of the population.",

It is clear that psychological well-being and physical safety are intrinsically interconnected and cannot be reasonably categorised as fully separate safety dimensions. Severe depression and anxiety can lead to self-harm and even suicide and domestic violence which all affect the physical well-being of individuals. Nevertheless, the focus of studies in this stream is on the indirect mental health impacts of this global epidemic rather than the biological and clinical aspects.",

Barari et al. (2020) also sampled and surveyed Italian population and concluded that people, even those who do not trust the government, generally accept the public health messages during this crisis. Compliance is generally high although slightly lower among young adults. Their survey also indicated that the quarantine has started to have serious negative effects on mental health. In light of their findings, they proposed that communications during the crisis should shift focus from mere advice to stay at home to more informative and constructive behavioural interventions, such as activities that can counter the impact of isolation. The study of Wang et al. (2020a) reports on another survey of the general public in China aiming to better understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Their findings indicate that more than half of the studied population rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe.

Casting a wide net of pandemic-related safety research now can greatly facilitate societal and organizational learning in handling future pandemics. In this regard, it is highlighted that according to the Global Risks Report 2020 (WEF, 2020), infectious diseases is ranked the second-highest societal risk (after water crises), with only a few technological, geopolitical, and environmental risks higher rated. Thus, considering also that epidemic outbreaks have occurred relatively frequently in the past as shown e.g. in Figure 1(a), building safety-related knowledge for the current pandemic now, may contribute to better preparedness and response for the next outbreak.",

However, it is evident that in many countries, many workers in so-called essential services were tasked to remain professionally active to keep some key societal functions and utilities running. It is apparent that several such worker categories were exposed to higher infection risks than the general public, including grocery store staff, public transport and taxi drivers, and nursing home workers. With most of these workers having no prior knowledge of how to handle their personal safety in pandemics, anxiety and stress are important occupational hazards which would be important to build scientific evidence about. In addition, the effectiveness of safety measures in such different work environments, and their related training and behavioural implications, would be interesting areas of study.",

Although there is a well-established literature on this domain (Baghalian et al., 2013, Molero et al., 2017, Pan and Nagi, 2010, Tang, 2006, Yang, 2011), considering that this appeared to be a major concern of the public in the face of epidemics of this magnitude, further research seems to be needed on how to enhance the safety and robustness of supply chains while taking into account specific characteristics of the current health emergency. This may entail system-level studies of the disruptive effects of the impacts of the pandemic on essential multi-modal commodity supply chains by sea, land, or air freight. Furthermore, the occupational safety of port and aviation staff (Eldin et al., 2020), and seafarers and cruise line personnel are areas where research contributions are currently lacking. Many of these workers likely endured heightened levels of stress and anxiety due to prolonged periods at sea, sometimes onboard ships with confirmed infections and deaths, or in uncertain conditions far away from their families. Some work on occupational safety of these groups of workers exists, e.g. Useche et al., 2018, Shan and Lippel, 2019, but the authors are not aware of any research on occupational safety of these workers in a pandemic outbreak context.",

At the early stages of the pandemic, before extreme lockdown measures were in place in many geographical regions, certain societies had introduced more moderate measures to mitigate the risk of potential outbreaks that involved keeping the density of human congregation in public spaces below certain thresholds. Similar measures could be expected during the transition from strict isolation measures back to more moderate measures once the acute severity of this public health emergency diminishes. We assume that these unprecedented challenges should require the expertise of the researchers active in this domain to propose methods and solutions for how to enforce such restrictions regarding crowd management and safety. Such research could be highly relevant in open public spaces such as parks, recreational areas, and beaches, in closed public spaces such as grocery shops, university buildings and particularly hospital emergency departments (Chen et al., 2020c), also in closed spaces such as office buildings, cruise vessels, or airplanes (Eldin et al., 2020) as well as public or shared transport vehicles (Zheng et al., 2020b).",

It is assumed that, during the evacuation process, if appropriate measures are not taken to manage the evacuation process, a hasty unregulated evacuation in such instances could itself lead to heightened levels of spatial human concentration which can elevate the risk of contracting the virus for evacuees, particularly in high-occupancy buildings. In light of these concerns, we suggest that evacuation experts could revisit and further study the particular issues relevant to this problem and to propose appropriate methods and solutions for evacuation safety.",
