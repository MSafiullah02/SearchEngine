Whether allergic inflammation often found with sensitization increases the susceptibility for viral infections or enhances their ability to provoke further inflammation is not entirely clear.16 Type I interferons are important innate antiviral responses to respiratory viruses.14, 17 There is evidence that virus-induced interferon generation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells,18, 19, 20 plasmacytoid dendritic cells,21 and bronchial epithelial cells22, 23 is reduced in some patients with allergic asthma (Figure 2\n). It has been show that IgE occupancy of their membrane receptors inhibits antiviral generation of IFN-\u03b1 from plasmacytoid dendritic cells and may increase susceptibility to RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations (Figure 3\n). Deficient immune responses to viral infections may be present in type 2 inflammatory conditions with interferon production being inversely correlated with increasing airway eosinophilia, IL-4 levels, and total serum IgE.23 Finally, the use of inhaled IFN-\u03b2 at the time of an upper respiratory infection reduces the airway viral load and improves clinical symptoms in patients with asthma.24\n",

Thus, the synergistic benefits of both ICS and LABA on airway eosinophilic inflammation might explain a greater reduction in exacerbations. Alternatively, an early use of ICS/LABA for relief of symptoms might simply deliver additional ICS to the airway early in the course of an emerging exacerbation.",

Perhaps, this is because environmental interventions usually focus on a single allergen, such as dust mites,90 or environmental tobacco smoke,91 and with this limited approach, no effect was seen on asthma morbidity. However, an Inner-City Asthma Study evaluated the effectiveness of a multifaceted, home-based, environmental intervention that used remediation of exposure to dust mites, passive smoking, cockroaches, pets, rodents, and mold92 and was tailored to each child's skin-test sensitization profile and environmental exposures. The intervention group reported significantly fewer symptoms of asthma during both the intervention year and, interestingly, the follow-up year as well (Figure 6\n), with significantly fewer unscheduled asthma-related visits to the ED or clinic for the intervention group (P = .04). The correlation between the reduction in levels of cockroach allergen on the bedroom floor and asthma-related morbidity was particularly strong during the active intervention. Although it is difficult to generalize these results to all children with asthma, a reduction in continuous exposure to environmental allergens and irritants, like those present in the homes of inner-city patients with asthma, may indicate the need for a more comprehensive intervention.",
