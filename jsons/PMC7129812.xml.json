For instance, some migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong and Macau have lost their jobs because their employers have left the territory. Many domestic workers cannot obtain masks from the pharmacy because they must stay with employers and adhere to government-recommended self-quarantine.4\n",

It can, however, also spread inaccurate information and panic that could lead to IMWs delaying visits to health centres due to stigmatisation of those who are infected.5\n",

Public health campaigns should be available in multiple languages and diffused through various communication channels and networks of IMWs as soon as possible. In addition, more countries should ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to provide global health equity and ensure that migrant workers' health is not neglected in future epidemics and disasters.",
