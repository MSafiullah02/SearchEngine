The Chinese government has adopted extreme measures to mitigate outbreak. On 23 January 2020, the local government of Wuhan suspended all public traffics within the city, and closed all inbound and outbound transportation. Other cities in Hubei province announced similar traffic control measures following Wuhan shortly, see Fig. 1\n.

Furthermore, its characteristics of mild symptoms in most cases and short serial interval (i.e., 4-5 days) ([Nishiura et al., 2020], [You et al., 2002]) are similar to pandemic influenza, rather than other two coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). In 1918, a significant proportion of the deaths were from pneumonia followed influenza infection. Thus, it might be reasonable to revisit the modelling framework of 1918 influenza pandemic, and in particular, to capture the effects of the individual reaction (to the risk of infection) and government action. In (He et al., 2013), we proposed a model incorporating individual reaction, holiday effects as well as weather conditions (temperature in London, United Kingdom) which successfully captured the multiple-wave feature in the influenza-associated mortality in London.",

We note that the governmental action, in both 1918 and current time, summarized all measures including holiday extension, city lock-down, hospitalisation and quarantine of patients. We presume it will last for the next few months for the moment, and will update later if things change. The parameter values may be improved when more information is available. We argue that all prevention and control measures may be categorised into two large groups, which are described by either a step function or a response function, respectively. We also consider zoonotic transmission period of one month and a huge emigration from Wuhan (35.7% of the population). Nevertheless, our model is a preliminary conceptual model, intending to lay a foundation for further modelling studies, but we can easily tune our model so that the outcomes of our model are in line with the observation and previous studies ([Wu et al., 2020], [Mahase, 2020]).",

We also assume a period of zoonotic transmission during December 2019.

We then only model the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after this date, along with the emigration of 5 million population before Wuhan was officially locked down (South China Morning Post, 2020).

We assume (i) the zoonotic cases only make impacts during December 2019 (Huang et al., 2020); (ii) the effect of governmental action starts on 23 January 2020 (in particular, \u03b1=0.4249 during 23-29 January 2020 and \u03b1=0.8478 after that); (iii) the emigration from Wuhan starts on 31 December 2019 and ends on 22 January 2020.",

To take this effect into account, we assume 10% of the population are \u2018protected\u2019. Recently studies showed the serial interval of COVID-19 could be as short as 5 days ([Nishiura et al., 2020], [You et al., 2020]), and the median incubation period could be as short as 3 days (Guan et al., 2020). These characteristics imply short latent period and infectious period. Thus, we adopt a relatively shorter mean latent period (3 days) and mean infectious period (4 days). Different from (He et al., 2013), we use the severe cases and death in the individual reaction function, instead of death only. We also increase the intensity of the governmental action such that the model outcomes (increments in cases) largely match the observed, with a reporting ratio. Namely only a proportion of the model generated cases will be reported in reality. Many evidences and studies, e.g., ([Tuite and Fisman, 2020], [Zhao et al., 2020], [Zhao et al., 2020]), suggest the reporting ratio is time-varying. We summarise our parameters in Table 1\n.",

We notice that there is a delay of 14 days between symptom onset and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 between the two datasets which are largely the same group of patients. Namely if we put back data in Li et al (Li et al., 2020) by 14 days, it largely matches data in (Liu et al., 2020).

The reason is that the reported cases in these few days included clinical cases but not laboratory confirmed that are accumulated in the past few days, also weeks.\n",

Thus it would be challenging given a relatively short time series, and several other unknown parameters to be estimated. We employ some estimated parameter values from the 1918 influenza pandemic, given the similar characteristics of COVID-19 and influenza (most cases are mild) and the similar level of mitigation.
