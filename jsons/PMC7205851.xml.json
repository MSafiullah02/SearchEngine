Recently, not only M. alba, but also other Morus genus plants\u2019 (such as M. alba var. tatarica, M. lhou, M. australis, M. yunnanensis, M. cathayana, and M. nigra) chemical components and their biological activity have been evaluated [1\u20133].",

The cytotoxic properties against murine leukemia P-388 cells for kuwanon C (8), morusin (15), and 5,7,2\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone (56) obtained from the wood of M. australis were evaluated [32]. On comparing their inhibitory activities, it was found that the prenyl units at C-7 might be an active unit of prenyl flavonoids (8, 15 vs 56 with IC50 values at 14.0 \u00b1 1.0, 10.1 \u00b1 0.8, and 37.3 \u00b1 5.4 \u03bcM, respectively). In addition, on comparing the activities of compounds cathayanon H (57) and cathayanon I (58) isolated from the stem bark of M. cathayana, it suggested that C-2\u2032 hydroxylation might lower the cytotoxicity [33]. Meanwhile, the configurations of C-2 and C-3 might affect the activity (2R3S > 2S3R) [cathayanin B (59) vs cathayanin C (60, inactivive)] of flavonols (Fig. 6).",
