            "text": "The first demonstration of Toll involvement in host immunity was provided in 1996 by the observation that Toll\u2010deficient Drosophila are vulnerable to experimental infection with certain fungi (1). A family of proteins structurally related to Drosophila Toll, known as Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs), was subsequently identified in mice and humans (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Toll and TLR genes have now been described throughout the animal kingdom (7): 10 functional TLRs (from TLR1 to TLR10) have been identified in humans and 11 (from TLR1 to TLR7, TLR9, and from TLR11 to TLR13) in mice (8, 9). The TLR signaling pathway shares multiple components with that of interleukin\u20101 receptors (IL\u20101Rs), reflecting the intracellular domain common to these receptors, the Toll\u2013IL\u20101R (TIR) domain (10). The signaling pathways triggered by TLRs have been dissected in mice and, to a lesser extent, in humans (10, 11, 12) (Fig. 1). TLRs, with the exception of TLR3 (at least in mice), can trigger a \u2018classical\u2019 myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)\u2010dependent signaling pathway (10, 11, 12), via the TIR\u2010containing cytosolic adapter MyD88 (13, 14, 15, 16). TLR2 and TLR4 can also trigger this pathway via the TIR domain\u2010containing adapter protein (TIRAP) (17, 18, 19, 20). Alternatively, TLR3 and TLR4 can trigger a MyD88\u2010independent \u2018alternative\u2019 pathway (10, 11, 12, 21) via the TIR domain\u2010containing adapter inducing IFN\u2010\u03b2 (TRIF) (22, 23, 24); TLR4 may trigger this pathway by association with the TRIF\u2010related adapter molecule (TRAM), which bridges TLR4 and TRIF (25, 26).",

This classical pathway leads to the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201012, and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) (10, 11, 12). The alternative MyD88\u2010independent pathway (Fig. 1), also referred to as the TRIF\u2010dependent pathway, results in the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via two kinases, the inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase \u025b (IKK\u2010\u025b) and TANK (TRAF family member\u2010associated NF\u2010\u03baB activator)\u2010binding kinase\u20101 (TBK\u20101). The MyD88\u2010independent pathway leads to the transcription of a smaller number of genes, including IFN genes, such as that encoding IFN\u2010\u03b2 (10, 11, 12) and possibly also the IFN\u2010\u03bb gene (27). We now know that the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway can also activate IRF1 (28), IRF5 (29), and IRF7 (30, 31, 32). The MyD88\u2010dependent pathway may activate IRF3 via TANK, a molecule that can interact with TNF receptor\u2010associated factor\u20106 (TRAF6), NF\u2010\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), TBK\u20101, and IKK\u2010\u025b, linking the MyD88 pathway to IRF\u20103 (32, 33, 34, 35, 36). Conversely, the TRIF\u2010dependent pathway may also activate NF\u2010\u03baB, via RIP1 (37) or TRAF6 (38, 39) or via interactions between TRAF3, NEMO, and TANK (32, 33, 34, 35, 36). Although the NEMO\u2013TANK interaction seems to bridge the IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathways downstream from TLRs (35), the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these two pathways remain unclear.",

Five TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) have been shown to induce the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, and IFN\u2010\u03bb (11, 12, 40). Four of these TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) are intracellular in most cell types tested. They are found along the secretory and endocytic pathways and can be stimulated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking those produced during viral infections. TLR3 can be activated by double\u2010stranded RNA (41); TLR7 and TLR8 (in humans only) can be activated by antiviral derivatives of nucleoside\u2010like imidazoquinoline (42, 43) and loxoribine (44) and GU\u2010rich single\u2010stranded (ss) RNAs (45, 46, 47). TLR9 can be activated by non\u2010methylated double\u2010stranded (ds) CpG\u2010rich DNA (48, 49). Cell surface\u2010expressed human TLR4 can be stimulated by LPS and, possibly, by some viral proteins, but it is a much less potent inducer of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, and IFN\u2010\u03bb (50, 51, 52). TLR3 and TLR4 trigger IFN\u2010\u03b2 production via TRIF\u2013IRF3 activation, whereas TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 trigger IFN\u2010\u03b1 production via MyD88\u2013IRF7 activation (30, 31) and IFN\u2010\u03b2 production via MyD88\u2013IRF1 activation (28) or MyD88\u2013TRAF6\u2010NEMO\u2013TANK\u2013IRF3 activation (10, 12, 36). The TLR induction of IFN\u2010\u03b1, which are IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010inducible (53), has been studied in less detail than the induction of IFN\u2010\u03b2, and little is known about the mechanism of IFN\u2010\u03bb induction by TLRs.",

            "text": "The innate recognition of viruses by TLRs may lead to the induction of IFNs (12, 54). One key question concerns the importance of the TLR\u2013IFN pathway in protective antiviral immunity. Over the last 10 years, mice lacking individual TLRs and key molecules of the TLR signaling pathways, such as MyD88 and IRAK\u20104, have been shown to display diverse viral infectious phenotypes, from susceptibility to resistance, depending on the host gene\u2013pathogen combination (12, 55, 56) (1, 2). For example, TLR7\u2010deficient mice display impaired immunity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (47), and TLR9\u2010deficient mice are susceptible to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection (5). However, it remained unclear whether Toll and TLRs played non\u2010redundant roles, be they beneficial or detrimental, in natural as opposed to experimental infections, particularly in viral infections (57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62). Five human primary immunodeficiencies resulting in impaired TLR responses have recently been described (Fig. 1): X\u2010linked recessive NEMO deficiencies in 2001 (63, 64, 65), autosomal dominant I\u03baB\u03b1 deficiency in 2003 (66), autosomal recessive IRAK\u20104 deficiency in 2003 (67), autosomal recessive UNC\u201093B deficiency in 2006 (68), and autosomal dominant TLR3 deficiency in 2007 (69). Mutations in NEMO and I\u03baB\u03b1 impair many pathways other than TLRs, and the morbid alleles are hypomorphic and hypermorphic, respectively, making it difficult to assess antiviral TLR immunity in these patients. We review here the lessons learned from the three other primary immunodeficiencies (IRAK\u20104, UNC\u201093B and TLR3) that selectively or almost selectively impair TLR responses.",

            "text": "The four mammalian IRAK family members are orthologues of the serine\u2013threonine kinase Pelle, which is required for Toll signaling in Drosophila (70). IRAK\u20104 is the most similar to Pelle and plays an essential role in mediating the signals initiated by IL\u20101R and TLR engagement (70, 71, 72). Mouse IRAK\u20104 is 87% similar and 84% identical to human IRAK\u20104 (70). Like Pelle and the other members of the IRAK family, IRAK\u20104 contains an N\u2010terminal death domain (DD) and a central kinase domain (KD) (71). The crystal structures of the IRAK\u20104 DD and KD domains have recently been obtained for mice and humans, revealing structures in these domains of IRAK\u20104 very different from those of Pelle and other members of the IRAK family (73, 74). IRAK\u20104 acts as a kinase downstream from MyD88 and upstream from IRAK\u20101 and TRAF\u20106 (72). IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient mouse cells displayed strongly impaired IL\u20101R and TLR signaling, and the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK induced by IL\u20101 and multiple TLR agonists, including TLR7 and TLR9 agonists and the non\u2010specific TLR3 agonist polyinosinic\u2010polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], was profoundly inhibited in IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and macrophages (71). Knockin mice with an inactivated IRAK\u20104 kinase were recently produced. In these mice, TLR7\u2010 and TLR9\u2010mediated signaling is abolished in bone marrow (BM)\u2010derived macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The TLR7\u2010 and TLR9\u2010induced production of IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 was abolished in pDCs isolated from these mice, and the production of IFN\u2010\u03bb was not determined. However, TLR3\u2010mediated signaling was intact in myeloid DCs (mDCs) from IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient and IRAK\u20104\u2010kinase\u2010inactive knockin mice (75). In mice deficient for IRAK\u20101, a molecule immediately downstream from IRAK\u20104, TLR7\u2010, and TLR9\u2010mediated IFN\u2010\u03b1 production was also abolished (76). These in vitro data indicate that the TLR7 and TLR9 pathways governing the production of IFN, or at least of IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2, in response to viral infection are IRAK\u20104 dependent in mice. In contrast, the TLR3\u2013IFN pathway appeared to be IRAK\u20104 independent, at least in mDCs.",

Following infection with LCMV, IFN\u2010\u03b3 production was found to be severely impaired in IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient mice, but it remains unclear whether IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient mice are more susceptible to LCMV infection than the wildtype (WT) mice (Table 2) (71). Mice lacking MyD88, a molecule acting immediately upstream from IRAK\u20104, are prone to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV\u20101) encephalitis (HSE) following intranasal infection (77). In another model of footpad or corneal infection, no differences were found between MyD88\u2010deficient and WT mice (78). MyD88\u2010deficient mice have been shown to be susceptible to MCMV (5, 79), LCMV (80), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (81), and VSV in a route\u2010dependent (intranasal but not intravenous) manner (47, 82). They are also susceptible, although to a lesser extent, to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (83). However, MyD88\u2010deficient mice have been shown to be more resistant to coxsackievirus B3 infection than WT mice (84) (Table 2). Mice lacking IRAK\u20104 or MyD88 display impaired TLR7\u2010 and TLR9\u2010mediated induction of IFNs, and they are more susceptible than WT mice to experimental viral infections (5, 47, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82). The only known exceptions concern MyD88\u2010deficient mice infected with HSV\u20101 (78), coxsakievirus B3 (84), and VSV (intravenous route) (82) in certain experimental conditions (Table 2). However, the broader impairment of immunity in these mice, affecting multiple TLR and IL\u20101R responses, makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to whether the susceptibility of these mice to viruses results from the impairment of TLR7\u2010 and TLR9\u2010mediated induction of IFNs.",

IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient cells from these patients, including whole blood cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), individual myeloid and lymphoid leukocyte subsets, and skin\u2010derived fibroblasts, displayed impaired response to IL\u20101 and the TLR agonists tested, with the exception of TLR3 responses and TLR4\u2010mediated IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb responses (85, 86) (Fig. 2).

The identification of human UNC\u201093B deficiency also provided the first evidence that HSE can result from a monogenic trait.

HSE is not accompanied by the dissemination of HSV\u20101 disease via the bloodstream or epithelium (95). Moreover, HSE patients are typically resistant to other infections, both before and after HSE, as serological tests have shown these patients to have been exposed to many other viruses, with no severe clinical manifestations (68, 69) (Table 3).

It is currently difficult to compare the infectious phenotypes of UNC\u201093B\u2010deficient mice and humans, as such mice have been inoculated with few pathogens and only two patients have been described.

TLR3, like other TLRs, consists of an extracellular leucine\u2010rich repeat (LRR) motif, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and an intracellular TIR domain (103). The crystal structure of the TLR3 ectodomain (ECD) has been determined. This domain has been shown to take the form of a large, horseshoe\u2010shaped solenoid, potentially providing a large surface area for ligand interaction and recognition (104, 105). The ECD of TLR3 is essential for ligand binding and multimerization (104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109). TRIF recruitment is mediated by interaction with the TLR3 TIR domain, leading to IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB activation (10, 11, 12). TLR3 expression has been shown to be cell type specific, with this receptor preferentially expressed in DCs (110), fibroblasts (111), epithelial cells (112, 113, 114, 115), and CNS\u2010resident cells (116, 117, 118, 119, 120). Many in vitro studies have shown that a functional TLR3 is expressed in these cell types, which produce IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, \u2010\u03bb and other cytokines and chemokines in response to poly(I:C) stimulation, presumably via TLR3 (68, 112, 113, 115, 118, 119, 121). TLR3 is intracellular in most cell types (122) but has been detected on the surface of a few cell types, including fibroblasts (111). The cellular compartment in which dsRNA is efficiently recognized by TLR3 has not yet been identified. It is also unclear whether the natural dsRNA produced during viral infection can actually stimulate TLR3. However, as TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, an almost universal viral intermediate potentially generated during most viral infections, it is thought that TLR3 may play a broad role in antiviral immunity.",

In particular, they are susceptible to EMCV, displaying impaired induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a significantly higher viral load in the heart than that of WT mice following infection with this virus (123). TLR3\u2010deficient mice are also susceptible to MCMV in some experimental conditions, as shown by the impaired production of cytokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2in vivo, higher viral load in the spleen, and lower survival rate of TLR3\u2010deficient mice than that of WT mice (5). TLR3\u2010deficient mice are also susceptible to RSV infection, but to a lesser extent (124). Remarkably, TLR3\u2010deficient mice appear to be more resistant to other infections than WT mice (Table 1). Following infection with influenza A virus (IAV) (125), Punta Toro virus (PTV) (126), or West Nile virus (WNV) (127), TLR3\u2010deficient mice produce smaller amounts of inflammatory mediators, such as IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2, than WT mice, but had a higher survival rate. TLR3\u2010deficient mice did not differ from controls in their ability to generate both CD8+ T and CD4+ T IFN\u2010\u03b3 responses to LCMV, VSV, and MCMV; they were also similar to WT mice in terms of T3 reovirus\u2010induced injury in the CNS (128). Most studies have reported low levels of induction of cytokines or IFN in TLR3\u2010deficient mice, suggesting that TLR3 is involved in the balance of inflammatory mediators. Nevertheless, infectious phenotypes varied greatly, from enhanced susceptibility to enhanced resistance.

In these two children, from non\u2010consanguineous families, a heterozygous 1660C>T mutation (P554S) was found in TLR3 (69). There was no founder gene effect, as the two 1660C>T mutations were in different TLR3 haplotypes. The 1660C>T mutant allele is dominant negative for the response to poly(I:C) in fibroblasts, in terms of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and \u2010\u03bb induction. Fibroblasts, monocyte\u2010differentiated DCs, NK cells, and CD8+ T cells from the patients displayed an impaired response to poly(I:C). A defect in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and \u2010\u03bb by fibroblasts stimulated with HSV\u20101, VSV, and poly(I:C) has been observed in TLR3 heterozygous fibroblasts, like in UNC93B\u2010deficient fibroblasts. Higher virus titers and enhanced cell mortality upon HSV\u20101 and VSV infection were observed in both TLR3 heterozygous fibroblasts and UNC93B\u2010deficient fibroblasts complemented with IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2 and, less efficiently, IFN\u2010\u03bb. Impaired TLR3 signaling thus results in abnormally weak IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb production, enhanced viral replication, and enhanced cell death in fibroblasts. By inference, this is a plausible pathogenesis of HSE in the CNS. Indeed, TLR3 is the most abundantly and widely expressed TLR in CNS\u2010resident cells, including neurons (118), microglia (116, 119), astrocytes (116, 119), and oligodendrocytes (116).",

Nonetheless, clinical penetrance is incomplete, as five of the seven TLR3\u2010deficient individuals and one of the three UNC\u201093B\u2010deficient individuals did not develop HSE despite HSV\u20101 infection (69). Interestingly, UNC\u201093B and TLR3 deficiencies seem to confer predisposition to HSE alone, as the patients do not suffer from other viral diseases (Table 3) or from HSV\u20101 infections outside the CNS (69). TLR3\u2010independent IFN responses to dsRNA, even in some cells and tissues that express TLR3, may confer protection against a wide range of viruses in TLR3\u2010 and UNC\u201093B\u2010deficient patients (54). We have shown that mDCs and keratinocytes (which normally express TLR3) and pDCs (which do not normally express TLR3) produce IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb in response to poly(I:C), in a TLR3\u2010independent manner.

They have indicated that the IRAK\u20104\u2010 and UNC\u201093B\u2010dependent, TLR7\u2010, TLR8\u2010, and TLR9\u2010mediated induction of IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb is redundant for protective immunity to most viruses (Fig. 2). This finding by no means suggests that these pathways are not involved in antiviral immunity; they may be, although in a redundant manner. Similarly, the IRAK\u20104\u2010independent, UNC\u201093B\u2010dependent, TLR3\u2010mediated induction of IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb is redundant for protective immunity to most viruses. Nonetheless, this pathway seems to be selectively critical for protective immunity to HSV\u20101 in the CNS upon primary HSV\u20101 infection, in at least some children (Fig. 2). It is remarkable that HSV\u20101 does not spread via the epithelia or bloodstream in patients with no functional TLR3 or UNC\u201093B. It would be interesting to challenge TLR3\u2010 and UNC\u201093B\u2010deficient mice with HSV\u20101. The considerable redundancy observed in humans contrasts with the findings of many studies in mice showing that both the TLR7/8/9\u2013UNC\u201093B\u2013MyD88\u2013IRAK\u20104\u2013IFN pathway and the TLR3\u2013UNC\u201093B\u2013TRIF\u2013IFN pathway protect against experimental viral infections. Data for humans are more consistent with these pathways having a redundant effect on immunity to most viruses, and it may even well be that UNC\u201093B\u2010 and TLR3\u2010deficient patients are more resistant to some viruses than the general population. In our view, the differences between data for mice and humans probably result mostly from the differences between experimental and natural infections (57, 61), although intrinsic differences between the species may also have some effect.",

The precise role of the two TLR\u2013IFN pathways in protective immunity to viruses has therefore not been definitively determined. Receptors other than TLRs involved in sensing viral infections have been described recently, including cytosolic RNA helicases, retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I), which can be triggered by dsRNA and 5\u2032\u2010phosphated ssRNA (129, 130, 131), and melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA\u20105), which can be triggered by dsRNA (132). IFN\u2010inducing cytoplasmic recognition receptors may be critical for the control of viral infections, as suggested by in vitro and in vivo investigations in mice (54, 130, 133, 134). Other viral sensors, such as the IFN\u2010inducing cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor (135, 136, 137), have also been identified and may also be involved in antiviral immunity. We aim to evaluate the involvement of these molecules in natural antiviral immunity, by searching for germline mutations in the genes encoding these molecules, in patients with unexplained viral diseases. As viruses have developed multiple strategies for counteracting host antiviral IFN\u2010mediated immunity (138, 139), these investigations may improve our understanding of host\u2013virus interaction and evolution.",

Five TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) have been shown to induce the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, and IFN\u2010\u03bb. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 trigger the \u2018classical\u2019 MyD88\u2010dependent TLR pathway, via the TIR\u2010containing cytosolic adapter MyD88. TLR3 triggers the \u2018alternative\u2019 MyD88\u2010independent, TIR domain\u2010containing adapter inducing IFN\u2010\u03b2 (TRIF)\u2010dependent pathway via the TRIF. TLR4 triggers the MyD88\u2010dependent TLR pathway, via the TIRAP\u2013MyD88 interaction, and triggers the MyD88\u2010independent pathway, via the TRIF\u2010related adapter molecule(TRAM)\u2013TRIF interaction. The MyD88\u2010dependent pathway results in the activation of both nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs), via the interleukin\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase (IRAK) complex, which comprises two active kinases (IRAK\u20101 and IRAK\u20104) and two non\u2010catalytic subunits (IRAK\u20102 and IRAK\u2010M). The MyD88\u2010independent pathway results in the activation of IRF3 via two kinases: NF\u2010\u03baB kinase \u025b (IKK\u2010\u025b) and TANK\u2010binding kinase\u20101 (TBK\u20101). TRAF family member\u2010associated NF\u2010\u03baB activator (TANK) interacts with NF\u2010\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), TBK1, and IRF3 and may therefore liaise between the MyD88\u2010dependent and MyD88\u2010independent pathways. These signaling pathways triggered by TLRs have been dissected in mice and, to a lesser extent, in humans. The three proteins in the TLR signaling pathways (IRAK\u20104, UNC\u201093B, and TLR3) responsible for the human primary immunodeficiencies discussed in this review are shown in red, the other two proteins in the TLR signaling pathways (NEMO, I\u03baB\u03b1) responsible for human primary immunodeficiencies not discussed here are shown in blue. The principal pathways proposed are indicated by solid arrows, and recently described important associations between molecules are indicated with dotted arrows.",

Four of the five IFN\u2010inducing TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) are intracellular in most cell types tested. Viral nucleic acids, including double stranded (ds) RNA, single stranded (ss) RNA, and DNA, produced during virus replication are thought to be detected by TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9, respectively, and to induce IFN production. The production of IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb in response to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 stimulation is impaired in interleukin\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase (IRAK)\u20104\u2010deficient patients, who appear to be resistant to most viruses. The induction of IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b2, and \u2010\u03bb by TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 is impaired in UNC\u201093B\u2010deficient patients, who are prone to herpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis (HSE) but appear to be resistant to most viruses.
