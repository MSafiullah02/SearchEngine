According to the real-time data of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China up until February 5, 2020, within a short period of half a month, the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths were 24,443 and 493, respectively. The epidemic is progressing rapidly. 2019-nCoV poses new public health challenges in China.5 In Wuhan, China, the number of local medical staff is insufficient for the demand resulting from the explosive increase in the number of infected patients. Therefore, many medical personnel are needed to devote themselves to the front line of combating the virus.",
