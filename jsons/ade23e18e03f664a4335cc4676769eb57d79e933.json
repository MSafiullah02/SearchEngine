To address this objective, this paper employs hierarchical clustering, strategic diagrams and network analysis to construct the intellectual map of the I3E community and to visualize the thematic landscape in this field, using co-word analysis. Overall, a total of 835 papers from the proceedings of the e-Business, e-Services and e-Society (I3E) conference, and the respective 2574 author-assigned keywords, were included in the analyses. The results indicate that the community has significantly focused in areas like technology adoption models, Social Media, e-Government and business models; sentiment analysis and m-payments are peripheral themes, yet topics like cloud computing and Open Data are emerging. The analysis highlights the shift of the research interest throughout the past decades, and the rise of new topics, comprising evidence that the field is expanding and evolving. Limitations of the approach and future work plans conclude the paper.",

The proliferation of such technologies, coupled with the rapid adoption of computer-based systems and the investments in network infrastructures, created a new wave of opportunities on digitalized processes [1, 22] . Along this progression, research has focused on issues related to each transition, examining obstacles of adoption from the individual to the industry level, value generating mechanisms, and the anticipated and unanticipated effects of integrating these technologies in everyday life.",

Doing so will allow researchers to understand the evolution of the field over the past two decades and identify the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The most appropriate way to examine all publications presented in the conferences throughout these years is by applying a methodology that quantifies the core topics, the marginal contributions, the under-developed themes, and the forthcoming ideas that worth investing on, as well as how these topics are related and move between these states during the last 18 years. The main objective of this work is to capture, interpret and understand the big picture in the I3E domain from a quantified viewpoint. The research presented in this paper is a mapping study of the I3E field; it is a review that seeks to identify, not results, but linkages, shows the internal dynamics and structure of the domain, and pinpoints the topics with impact in the given discipline.",

The quantity and quality of the research activity within this community has been the topic to a variety of literature reviews, aiming to evaluate the research progress, impact and societal value, from different viewpoints (e.g., [9, 12, 26, 27] ). For instance, persuasiveness of electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) communications has received much attention from scholars because it can affect consumers' purchase attitudes, intention, decisions, and hence sales. A dedicated review of existing literature on the topic offered an overview of the determinants of eWOM persuasiveness, identified gaps in current research and provided directions for future research [12] .",

The findings demonstrate the role of blockchain as a facilitator of instant payments, trusted interfaces and traceability of goods for the consumers. Specifically, businesses can be benefited from blockchain in terms of machine-to-machine transactions, accounting, business process management and provenance traceability.

Overall, 835 peer-reviewed papers were produced within the community of I3E and published to-date. The keynote speeches, prefaces to the conference-, or track proceedings, as well as the papers that did not contain any keywords, were excluded from the analysis. From the collected papers, the author-assigned keywords were extracted from the metadata of each paper and were used as a unit of analysis. The keywords used for the description of the content of a publication can be seen as the basic building blocks of the structure of a research field; an article's keywords provide an adequate summary of its content, and thus can be utilized to reduce a large space of descriptors (i.e., article text) to a network graph of smaller related spaces (i.e., keywords) [6] . Although when authors choose keywords to describe their work those keywords can either be very generic or very specific, still, those keywords are human annotations on the content of the papers, reflecting human judgement and perspective. The idea is to understand the conceptual structure and evolution of a field directly from the interaction between keywords: if two keywords co-occur within a paper, then the two topics they represent are related; higher co-word frequency implies stronger correlation in keywords pairs, further suggesting that two keywords are related to a specific theme [6] . The 835 papers are distributed per year of publication as shown in Fig. 1 .",

The retrieved authorassigned keywords were manually pre-processed and standardized through merging words that convey similar meaning (e.g., \"electronic government\" and \"e-Gov\" were merged into \"eGovernment\"), fixing misspelled keywords (e.g., \"goverment\"), following a common spelling for UK and US terms (e.g., \"behaviour\" and \"behavior\"), and filtering broadly used terms (e.g., \"IoT\" and \"Internet of Things\"; \"WoM\" and \"Word of Mouth\") -following the approach recommended in [11, 17] , in a noninvasive manner. Keywords appearing in singular and plural forms of nouns and gerunds were also merged. At the end of this pre-processing, 1732 keywords (67.3% of the original dataset) were identified as unique and were subjected to further analysis. In order to be able to apply this method, papers from more than 5 years of research are required. The Kolmogorov Smirnoff test shown that the frequency of keywords follows a power-law distribution with an alpha of 1.87. Due to this heavy-tailedness, the research landscape of I3E is a scale-free network, with small number of popular terms acting as \"hubs\": they connect different topics, capture major research directions and influences in the field, and shape its intellectual structure [11] . A scale-free network also suggests that major research themes can be detected with small subset of popular terms. A previous analysis in the HCI research field demonstrated that less than 100 keywords are enough to describe the intellectual progress of a field [17] . Thus, in the present study we decided to include only those keywords that appear more than four times (n ! 4) in the period 2001-2019. This decision was grounded on two facets: (a) the frequency of a term reflects its significance for a research community, i.e., the higher the frequency is, the more often the term attracts the researchers' attention/interest; and (b) the retained 65 keywords (total frequency = 646, 37.3% of the total unique keywords) cover 461 (86.8%) of the 531 articles (with keywords) published. Furthermore, for the given datasets of terms and papers, n = 4 is the minimum term frequency that achieves the highest inclusion of papers in the datasets. For example, for authorassigned keywords with n ! 3, the retained keywords are N = 150 and cover 88.9% of the papers, whereas for keywords with n ! 5, N = 57 keywords, covering 72.3% of the papers. Thus, with fewer yet highly frequent terms we could satisfactorily describe the I3E network of terms.",

Co-word analysis has been proposed as a content-analysis technique to map the strength of relations between terms in texts and to trace patterns and trends in term associated-ness [5] . The idea behind co-word analysis rests on the assumption that keyterms identified within an article (e.g., keywords) can adequately describe and communicate the content of that article; the co-occurrence of at-least two keywords in the same article indicates a linkage between the topics, i.e., a \"theme\" [4] . The main units of analysis are keywords, clusters (i.e., sets of keywords) and keyword networks [17] .",

Graphs consist of nodes that represent the keywords, and links that represent the interactions between the nodes. Given a network of keywords, a combination of clustering, network analysis and strategic diagrams is used to model the conceptual structure of a field and to characterize it [4] . The graph theory concepts employed are centrality (i.e., the strength of the links from one research theme or cluster to others, indicating its significance in the development of the community [17] ) and density (i.e., the coherence of a cluster and a measure of a theme's development [10] ). Combining centrality and density allows for the creation of two-dimensional strategic diagrams [4] (Fig. 2) : the position of a cluster in the diagram corresponds to the importance of the cluster in the whole network (i.e., centrality x-axis) in relation to how well the theme of this cluster is developed (i.e., density -yaxis).",

In addition, a keyword network graph was created from the keywords list. In this graph, each keyword is represented as a node, and the keywords that co-appear on a paper are linked together. By creating associations between keywords, multiple networks associated with different themes are also created. In this case, bridges are built between the nodes of keywords, to allow communication and information flow between isolated regions in the whole network. Those nodes are known as structural holes [21] . Keywords acting as structural holes serve as a \"backbone\" of a network: if removed, the network will lose its cohesion and will disintegrate into separated and unconnected concepts. Thus, the network's core-periphery structure needs to be computed, to determine which nodes are part of a densely connected core (i.e., with a higher number of bridges), or a sparsely connected periphery [24] . Core nodes are reasonably well-connected to peripheral nodes, while peripheral nodes are sparingly connected to a core node or to each other. A node belongs to a core only if it is well-connected to other core nodes and to peripheral nodes [24] . A follow-up core-periphery analysis was performed to spot the core research topics from the perspective of the whole network. In this analysis, keywords were categorized according to their popularity, coreness (i.e., connectedness with other topics) and constraint (i.e., backbone). The whole approach is illustrated in Fig. 3. ",

In other words, the field is in general fragmented, with only one theme having received substantial attention from the community, in terms of human annotations. Furthermore, in Fig. 4 , the author-assigned keywords indicate that the community has few internally well-structured research themes, yet with weak external ties (Ivory Towers), acting as peripheral nodes to the global network (i.e., connect only to core nodes, yet not necessarily to mainstream topics only), and classified in clusters C2, C3 and C4 (e.g., mPayments, Digital Payment, Twitter, Sentiment Analysis, UTAUT2, Perceived Risk). Those topics appear to have high-density, i.e., the clustering coefficient is high and the topics within each of the cluster are very well connected to each other, but they lack strong ties with topics that are external to them. The following-up core-periphery analysis will provide insight on that issue. Regarding the themes that are either emerging or disappearing (Chaos/ Unstructured), the author-assigned keywords revealed that researchers have developed a considerable number of topics within a sense -\"marginal\" interest in the I3E network, classified in clusters C6, C7, C8, C9, C12 and C13 (e.g., eWOM, online Reviews, motivation, information Seeking, eServices, Cloud Computing, SaaS, Business Intelligence, eBusiness models, Open Data, information technology), as illustrated in Fig. 4 . The term \"marginal\" here is used to describe both the cases of \"close-to-disappearing\" and \"nearly rising\" topics, i.e., topics that either tend to no-longer attract major interest, or they have recently started to attract attention, but have not yet been well-developed. Finally, a substantial number of transversal themes (Bandwagon) have been detected as well, i.e., themes that are strongly linked to specific research interests throughout the network yet are only weakly linked together. These are categorized in the clusters C1 (e.g., customer engagement, facebook, social media, use and gratification theory, social networks), C10 (e.g., social commerce, WoM, trust, privacy) C11 (e.g., eCommerce, interoperability, interorganizational system, security, supply chain, eBusiness, web services, QoS) and C14 (e.g., IoT, Smart Cities, artificial intelligence, eGovernment, b2b).",

Figure 5 displays the results. Each node in the graph represents a keyword that is linked to other keywords that appear on the same paper. The size of the nodes is proportional to the frequency of the keywords, the color of the node corresponds to the cluster the keyword has been classified in, and the thickness of the links between the nodes is proportional to the co-occurrence correlation for that pair of keywords. To reduce visual clutter, a centralized subset of the complete network is illustrated, omitting isolated nodes and keywords with less than 3 strong ties, that would lead to a highly disconnected network. Finally, core-periphery analysis was performed to identify the core research topics, from a whole-network perspective, as individual keywords, regardless of the cluster they belong to. The analysis yielded 10 topics in each of the categories ( Table 2 ):",

The use of user generated data, and the integration with social media platforms offers an interesting perspective into the generated insight, the services that can be built based on this insight, as well as the implications and ethical issues that accompany such ventures. Big data and business analytics ecosystems may pave the way towards digital transformation and sustainable societies [23] . Furthermore, the strong link between e-commerce and social media (Table 1) , denotes the increased prevalence of social commerce efforts over the last years (e.g., [18] ). We witness an increased number of social media platforms featuring commercial aspects, with some notable examples being Facebook and Instagram. As more vendors utilize these platforms, trust emerges as a core aspect [9] , both regarding the sales side and the products featured on these, as well as on the data exchanged and utilized for marketing and sales promotions [8] . Recent events (e.g. the Cambridge Analytica scandal) surfaced issues about privacy violation and use of data by third-parties which have come to the attention of the general population. As social media and e-commerce vendors become increasingly more integrated, data sharing and ownership issues will be brought in the spotlight of research/practice. While these are some of the major trends that can be detected throughout an analysis of the field covered by the I3E conference, there are many more sub-fields that are likely to be fruitful areas for future research. Our ambition was to illustrate some of these as well as to identify the core areas that have received the center light of attention by researchers over the past two decades. Our analysis indicates that the three pillars of the I3E conference are becoming increasingly more fussed, and that future research is likely to bridge all three domains to derive important research and practical knowledge.",
