            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with viruses and bacteria as its main causes, is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide [1]. Early detection of bacterial cases that have the potential for a rapid negative evolution is essential to guide clinical management and to avoid prolonged hospitalization and the risk of death [2]. Furthermore, the differentiation of viral from bacterial CAP is necessary for the rational use of antibiotics and the consequent reduction in the emergence of bacterial resistance and drug-related adverse events [3]. Unfortunately, both these goals are difficult to achieve, particularly in younger children in whom the collection of respiratory samples is difficult or impossible to obtain [4]. Clinical signs and symptoms and radiological findings are frequently similar in cases of viral and bacterial disease [4]. Moreover, in most cases, the results from routine laboratory tests, such as white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level determination, tend to overlap, making the differentiation impossible [5]. This challenge also exists when using procalcitonin (PCT) to define the etiology and severity of CAP. PCT was the latest biomarker to enter into routine clinical practice [6].",

Recently, it has been suggested that soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) could improve the determination of CAP etiology and severity [7\u20139]. For all these biomarkers, data collected in adults seem to indicate that their concentrations in body fluids are increased in cases of bacterial infections, particularly in the most severe cases. However, the available data are limited and sometimes conflicting. Moreover, to date no evaluation was performed in children. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these new biomarkers to distinguish bacterial from viral CAP and to identify severe CAP cases in children. The results were compared with those derived from WBC counts, neutrophil percentages, and serum CRP and PCT levels.",

Exclusion criteria included the presence of an underlying chronic disease or an antibiotic treatment of any type in the 48 hours before the admission. In each center, all chest radiographs were evaluated by an expert radiologist who classified the findings as alveolar CAP, non-alveolar CAP or no CAP in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the standardized interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs for a diagnosis of pneumonia [10]. Chest radiography characterized by presence of consolidation (defined as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe or of the entire lung, that may or may not contain air-bronchograms above) or pleural effusion in the lateral pleural space was considered indicative of alveolar CAP. Non-alveolar CAP was diagnosed in case of linear and patchy densities (interstitial infiltrate) in a lacy pattern involving both lungs, featuring peribronchial thickening and multiple areas of atelectasis. The same diagnosis was made when minor patchy infiltrates not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary consolidation and small areas of atelectasis that could not be distinguished from consolidation were evidenced. The CAP severity of disease was established in all the participating hospitals using the criteria indicated for children by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) [11]. In particular, features of severe disease in an infant were considered as follows: oxygen saturation <92%; cyanosis; respiratory rate >70 breaths/min; significant tachycardia for the fever level; prolonged central capillary refill time \u22652 s; difficulty in breathing; intermittent apnea; grunting; and not feeding. Features of severe disease in an older child included the following: oxygen saturation <92%; cyanosis; respiratory rate >50 breaths/min; significant tachycardia for the fever level; prolonged central capillary refill time \u22652 s; difficulty in breathing; grunting; and signs of dehydration. Both the evaluation of the chest radiograph and the classification of severity of each CAP episode were blinded to all the studied biological criteria, including WBC count, and CRP and PCT serum levels. After enrollment, within minutes from hospitalization the demographic, clinical history and clinical disease characteristics of each child were recorded. Moreover, a blood sample was drawn at admission to the hospital and divided in two parts: one sample was sent to the central laboratory of the hospital for the determination of routine tests including the WBC count, the percentage of neutrophils, and CRP level; the second sample was used for the determination of PCT, sTREM-1, MR-proANP, and MR-proADM levels as well as for pneumococcal and Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection. Finally, a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from all the enrolled children using a pernasal nylon flocked swab and was stored in a tube of universal transport medium (Kit Cat. No. 360c, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) for respiratory virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection. The serum of the blood samples that had to be used for new biomarkers\u2019 serum level determination and nasopharyngeal samples were conserved in freezer at -80\u00b0C in each center and later sent to the laboratory of the Pediatric High Intensity Care Unit of the University of Milan for centralized processing.",

An automated immunofluorescent assay was used for the determination of the levels of MR-proADM, MR-proANP and PCT according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (BR\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S, Germany). The functional assay sensitivity was previously assessed as being less than 0.25 nmol/L for MR-proADM, 10 pmol/L for MR-proANP, and 0.06 ng/mL for PCT. The detection limit that was calculated using the imprecision profile was previously assessed as being 0.02 ng/mL with a probability of 95% for PCT, 0.05 nmol/L for MR-proADM, and 2.1 pmol/L for MR-proANP. sTREM-1, MR-proADM, MR-proANP and PCT were chosen due to the sensitivity and specificity showed in adults with CAP for differentiating viral and bacterial CAP or severe and non-severe CAP [7\u20139].

Then, radiological findings were coupled with results of the real-time PCR tests on blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs. Evidence of S. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae in these samples further supported bacterial etiology. Notably, S. pneumoniae can be detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of children with viral CAP [15], but its presence in absence of viral detection in children with alveolar CAP is suggestive of probable pneumococcal CAP [16\u201318]. Moreover, even if it has been recently reported that M. pneumoniae is frequently carried in otherwise healthy children [19], it seems reasonable to think than when this pathogen is detected in children with CAP in absence of S. pneumoniae or respiratory viruses, it is the real cause of the lower respiratory infection independent of the radiological characteristics [20]. Finally, the presence of one or more respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx is commonly considered the etiologic agent of CAP because carriage of viruses in healthy subjects is uncommon [21]. In practical terms, CAP was considered to have a probable bacterial (PB) origin in the presence of 1) the detection of S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae in the blood with a chest radiograph indicative of any type of CAP; 2) a nasopharyngeal swab positive for S. pneumoniae associated with chest radiograph suggesting alveolar CAP; and 3) a nasopharyngeal swab positive for M. pneumoniae associated with chest radiograph suggesting any type of CAP. Probable viral (PV) CAP was diagnosed in the presence of a nasopharyngeal swab that was positive for one or more respiratory viruses associated with a chest radiograph leading to the diagnosis of non-alveolar CAP. Cases that could not be included in these groups were considered undetermined. Clinical information and blood test results were not available to the person that made this final classification of bacterial versus viral CAP:",

In this study, to overcome the clinical, radiological and laboratory problems that limit the definition of etiology and severity of CAP in children, the identification of bacterial and viral CAP was based on the criteria usually accepted by the international literature [16\u201318]. A combined evaluation of radiological findings and detection in the blood and in nasopharyngeal samples of the most important respiratory viral and bacterial agents of CAP in children, was performed. Moreover, to establish severity, the criteria suggested by BTS were used. Despite a certain number of CAP cases, probably those due to mixed infection, remained undetermined, this method has probably lead to the identification of those CAPs which are more likely due only to bacteria or only to viruses. Interestingly, as reported in several recent studies and probably thanks to the new molecular diagnostic methods that permit us to enlarge in comparison with the past possibilities for viral identification [4], the prevalence of PB and PV among children with severe CAP was similar. A global evaluation of the results of this study seemed to indicate that in children with CAP, sTREM-1, MR-proANP, and MR-proADM blood levels are unable to differentiate bacterial from viral diseases or to identify severe cases. At admission, the mean values of all these biomarkers were similar in PB and PV cases. When attempts to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of each of these biomarkers in defining the etiology and severity of the studied CAP cases were made, either the sensitivity or the specificity was found to be very low, leading to a modest predictive value. This result was confirmed by the values of the AUC, which were always below 0.70 for a single biomarker for both the definition of the etiology and the assessment of severity, a value that suggests poor accuracy of the studied tests. Moreover, for the definition of the etiology of pediatric CAP, the predictive ability of these biomarkers seemed to be lower than that of CRP and PCT, whereas for the identification of severe cases the best results were obtained with evaluations of PCT and MR-proANP.",

Some studies have reported that in cases of sepsis or CAP, sTREM-1 is a superior indicator of bacterial disease compared with CRP and PCT [22, 23]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that sTREM-1 levels were significantly higher in neonates with sepsis than in healthy controls [24]. Finally, in children with bronchiectasis, sTREM-1 sputum levels correlated with markers of neutrophilic inflammation but not necessarily with CRP concentrations, suggesting that sTREM-1 may be more sensitive in detecting pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation than CRP [25]. However, other studies have reported results similar to those found by our study. In adults with ventilator-associated pneumonia, sTREM1 was a poor predictor of VAP among critically ill subjects undergoing direct bronchoscopy [26, 27]. Different patient and sample characteristics used to measure sTREM-1 concentrations might explain the different results. In most of the cases showing a role for sTREM-1 in the diagnosis of bacterial infection, the data were collected in patients with a chronic underlying disease who were hospitalized in intensive care unit, whereas in this study, only otherwise healthy children with an acute CAP episode were enrolled. Moreover, the different criteria used to classify the etiology and severity of CAP could explain the differences among the results presented in the literature.",

Moreover, in diseases associated with bacteremia, this biomarker is increased [30]. Because CAP with bacteremia is generally the most severe, it was concluded that this biomarker could simultaneously detect bacterial CAP and identify the most severe cases. Alan et al. reported that the addition of blood biomarkers, including MR-proANP, to clinical scores significantly improved the prognostic capabilities of the pneumonia severity index [31]. Kruger et al. reported that MR-proANP was a good predictor of mortality risk in patients with CAP [29]. However, the poor ability by MR-proANP to predict bacteremia in patients with CAP was evidenced by Guinard-Barbier et al. [32]. Additionally, in this case, differences in the characteristics of the studied patients might explain the results. None of the children in our study had chronic heart failure, and the number of bacteremia cases was very small. It is possible that the blood levels of this biomarker significantly increased and had a true prognostic value only in very severe bacteremic cases of CAP. Moreover, the criteria used in this study to measure severity were different from those used in the studies in which adults were enrolled. In those studies, severity was measured considering the final outcome of the disease, whereas in this study, consistent with pediatric guidelines, severity was considered only at admission.",

CRP and PCT were slightly better than WBC count and neutrophil percentage. However, the importance of CRP and PCT in the definition of the etiology and the severity of pediatric CAP has been largely studied and discussed with conflicting results. CRP as a type of acute-phase reaction protein is closely related with inflammatory reaction and tissue injuries and can be influenced by factors other than bacterial components. For many years, it has been shown that only extremely high CRP serum levels are associated with bacterial disease and a negative prognosis, whereas in many cases, such values do not permit an estimate of the real etiology of the disease [32\u201334]. Cohen et al. showed that PCT and not CRP was the only independent predictor of apyrexia in children hospitalized for CAP [35]. However, recently, it has been reported that CRP can predict outcomes of pediatric CAP cases because CRP levels are significantly associated with both fever duration and hospital length of stay [36]. For every 1 mg/dL increase in CRP, the length of stay increased by 1 hour. Moreover, it was shown that extremely elevated CRP levels are associated with unfavorable outcomes, including death, in pediatric patients, highlighting the importance of very high levels, uncommonly assessed in daily practice [37]. Similarly, the results reported for PCT are inconsistent. Nascimento-Carvalho et al. showed that in 95 children, PCT had a negative predictive value for differentiating bacteremic infections from viral infections, atypical bacterial infections, and nonbacteremic typical bacterial infections [38]. More recently, Galetto-Lacour et al. reported a positive role of PCT in differentiating bacterial from viral CP, particularly when the disease was due to S. pneumoniae [39]. Additionally, we previously used a PCT cut-off value to identify PV CAP and to guide antibiotic therapy [40]. Conflicting results were reported in other studies. Korpi et al. reported that PCR had a sensitivity in the identification of bacterial CAP of only 55% [41], whereas later, these authors found that high values of PCT \u22655 ng/mL were associated with a high predictivity of bacterial CAP [42]. However, it seems evident that only very high serum concentrations of PCT are predictive of true bacterial CAP. Regarding PCT and disease severity, a study by Don et al. found that higher mean values were present in children who needed hospitalization; additionally, in this case, a non-marginal number of cases could not be classified because of similar results among children with mild and severe disease [43].",
