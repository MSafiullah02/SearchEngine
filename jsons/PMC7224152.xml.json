Anemia is an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events, bleeding, and mortality in patients with acute cardiac disease [1\u20135]. In addition, abnormal values of hematological indices, including red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) have also been associated with worse outcome in patients with acute cardiac disease [6\u201312]. In general intensive care unit (ICU) populations, the presence of anemia has been associated with demand myocardial ischemia, ICU readmission, and increased mortality [13\u201315]. As in patients with cardiac disease, elevated RDW and MCV are also associated with worse outcomes in general ICU patients [16\u201318].",

It remains uncertain whether predictors of mortality in general ICU patients without acute cardiac disease or in non-ICU patients with acute cardiac disease would apply similarly to the specialized CICU population. There is a paucity of published data available to describe the association between anemia, RDW, and MCV and adverse outcomes in CICU patients. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that anemia and abnormal values of RDW and MCV are associated with higher mortality in CICU patients.",

The admission value of all vital signs, clinical measurements, and laboratory values was used, defined as either the first value recorded after CICU admission or the value recorded closest to CICU admission. Although the WHO defines anemia as an admission Hb level < 12 g/dL in women and < 13 g/dL in men, we chose an operational definition of anemia as admission Hb < 12 g/dL regardless of gender [23]. Microcytosis was defined as an MCV < 80 fL and macrocytosis was defined as an MCV > 100 fL [23]. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-III score, APACHE-IV predicted hospital mortality and Day 1 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were calculated for all patients using data from the first 24 h of CICU admission, with missing variables imputed as normal as the default; the mean and maximum values of all daily SOFA scores while the patient remained in the CICU were recorded [20\u201322, 24, 25]. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and individual comorbidities were determined based on a previously-validated electronic algorithm [26]. Discharge diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, these diagnoses were not mutually exclusive, and the primary discharge diagnosis could not be determined.",

Groups were compared using Student t test and ANOVA for continuous variables and Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to calculate the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values for hospital mortality. Optimal cutoffs for predicting hospital mortality were determined from receiver-operator characteristic curves based on the highest value of Youden\u2019s J index (sensitivity + specificity \u22121). Multivariable analysis was performed to determine adjusted OR values for hospital mortality using an adaptive elastic net penalized logistic regression model, with candidate variables including demographics, comorbidities, illness severity, and CICU therapies and complications; an interaction term between Hb and RDW was included in the model [27]. Optimal tuning parameters for the elastic net were selected by linear grid search in conjunction with tenfold cross-validation to maximize the AUROC. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to compare 5-year post-discharge survival among patients surviving to hospital discharge (hospital survivors), with groups compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the associations between Hb, MCV, and RDW with post-discharge mortality after adjusting for predictors of hospital mortality. Two-tailed p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP version 13.0 Pro (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

The median age of the study population was 69.1 years (IQR 57.8, 78.9) and comprised 3604 (37.4%) females. The median CCI was 2 (IQR 0, 4), with a median APACHE-III score of 58 (IQR 45, 74) corresponding to a median APACHE-IV predicted mortality of 9.5% (IQR 4.0, 22.8). The median admission Hb level was 12.2 g/dL (IQR 10.6, 13.7); 4434 (46.0%) patients met our operational definition of anemia (admission Hb < 12 g/dL), while 5402 (56.0%) met the WHO gender-specific definition of anemia (46.3% of women and 53.7% of men).

Patients with anemia were older, more frequently female, had higher rates of comorbidities, greater illness severity and increased utilization of CICU therapies (all p < 0.05) compared to patients without anemia (Table 1); in addition, patients with anemia were more likely to have a discharge diagnosis of HF and less likely to have a discharge diagnosis of ACS. Significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, illness severity and CICU therapies across RDW quartiles, reflecting higher illness severity, more extensive comorbidities, lower Hb and greater use of CICU therapies in patients with higher RDW (Supplemental Table 1); the prevalence of HF increased and the prevalence of ischemic heart disease decreased with rising RDW quartile. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of HF had lower Hb (11.7 vs. 12.4 g/dL) and higher RDW (15.7% vs. 14.2%), while patients with a discharge diagnosis of ACS had higher Hb (12.5 vs. 11.9 g/dL) and lower RDW (14.1% vs. 15.3%) (all p < 0.001); MCV differed minimally between these groups.",

Unadjusted CICU mortality was higher in patients with anemia (6.5% vs. 4.4%, unadjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.28\u20131.82, p < 0.001), as was unadjusted hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 6.6%, unadjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.58\u20132.10, p < 0.001). Similar results were observed when using the WHO gender-specific definition of anemia: both CICU mortality (6.4% vs. 4.1%, unadjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.31\u20131.90, p < 0.001) and hospital mortality (10.8% vs. 6.2%, unadjusted OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.58\u20132.14, p < 0.001) were higher in patients with anemia. There was a stepwise increase in hospital mortality with decreasing admission Hb: \u2265 12 g/dL, 6.6%; 10.0\u201311.9 g/dL, 10.1%; 8.0\u20139.9 g/dL, 13.0%; < 8 g/dL 16.4% (p < 0.001). Admission Hb was inversely associated with hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 0.87 per 1 g/dL, 95% CI 0.84\u20130.90, p < 0.001), with an optimal cutoff of 11.5 g/dL for predicting hospital mortality. The unadjusted OR value for admission Hb was 0.84 per 1 g/dL (95% CI 0.78\u20130.90) among patients with anemia and 1.08 per 1 g/dL (95% CI 1.00\u20131.17) in patients without anemia, reflecting a U-shaped relationship between admission Hb and mortality (Fig. 1). Admission MCV was positively associated with hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 1.04 per 1 fL, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.05 p < 0.001), with an optimal cutoff of 94.6 fL for predicting hospital mortality. This relationship was similar among patients with anemia (OR 1.03 per 1 fL, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.05) and patients without anemia (OR 1.04 per 1 fL, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.06). A J-shaped relationship was observed between admission MCV and mortality (Fig. 2a); the MCV was associated with hospital mortality in patients with and without anemia, with mortality being highest in patients with macrocytic anemia (Fig. 2b). Admission RDW was positively associated with hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 1.20 per 1%, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.23, p < 0.001), with an optimal cutoff of 14.3% for predicting hospital mortality. This association that appeared to be stronger in patients without anemia (unadjusted OR 1.34 per 1%, 95% CI 1.28\u20131.41) compared to patients with anemia (unadjusted OR 1.11 per 1%, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.15). A progressive increase in mortality was observed with increasing decile of RDW, both in patients with and without anemia (Fig. 3).",

Post-discharge survival decreased in a stepwise fashion as a function of decreasing quartile of admission Hb (Fig. 4a, p < 0.001 by log-rank).

            "text": "This study has a number of relevant limitations that apply similarly to other retrospective cohort analyses, particularly the potential for additional unmeasured confounding variables. The CICU population at Mayo Clinic may differ from other populations in terms of baseline demographics and case mix [19]. We focused on admission laboratory values to predict mortality and were not able to determine whether changes in these variables during hospitalization influenced mortality risk. We did not have data available on pre-admission laboratory values, prior hematologic abnormalities, preceding transfusion, blood cell morphology, hemolysis, reticulocytosis, bleeding, iron studies, or vitamin levels. This prevented us from determining the causes and chronicity of anemia, elevated MCV, or elevated RDW in our patients, and from defining how these hematologic abnormalities may have led to higher mortality. Likewise, we did not have echocardiographic data available to better elucidate the relationships between HF and myocardial dysfunction with abnormal hematologic parameters. Our post-discharge mortality analysis should be considered exploratory, as the use of electronic health record review to determine patient death may underestimate post-discharge mortality by potentially failing to capture patients dying in other health systems. We did not have data available to determine cause of death, preventing us from providing specific insights about the mechanisms that could have linked abnormal hematologic indices with mortality risk.",

By contrast, elevated RDW was strongly associated with higher hospital mortality after adjusting for relevant covariates, as shown in other populations of cardiac and ICU patients. Anemia, MCV, and RDW were able to risk-stratify post-discharge mortality among hospital survivors. Incorporation of RDW into future severity of illness scores may be useful for enhancing mortality risk stratification. Future studies are needed to understand the relationship between RDW and outcomes in CICU patients to determine whether RDW reflects specific underlying pathophysiology or simply greater illness severity and to better define the underlying pathophysiology linking abnormal hematopoiesis and outcomes in patients with acute cardiovascular disease.",
