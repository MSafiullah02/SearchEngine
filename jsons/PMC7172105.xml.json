Importantly, the emergence of rapid, user-friendly, multiplexed assays has great potential to facilitate earlier ASP intervention [3, 4]. However, the impact of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on patient outcomes is clearer for some assays and specimen types than for others. Even less clear is how to optimize collaboration between laboratories and ASPs to maximize impact at the bedside. Here, we review published data related to clinical outcomes attributed to the use of current RDTs that detect pathogens in patients with bloodstream infections, respiratory infections, and neurological infections. In each case, we consider the following. Do we need molecular testing? Would rapid, on-demand testing be worthwhile to patients, or would batched testing suffice? And, finally, is there evidence supporting the use of the broad, syndromic, multiplexed tests, or do narrower monoplex or duplex assays suffice?",

They can be categorized into two groups: process measures and outcome measures [5]. Process measures include the duration of antimicrobial therapy and time to antimicrobial optimization (e.g., through escalation, in which a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial regimen is broadened, or through de-escalation, which involves the reverse). Examples of outcome measures include length of stay (LOS); clinical cure (e.g., \u201cclearance\u201d of a bloodstream infection from blood cultures); and incidence of 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and adverse drug reactions.

While the study was not adequately powered to show differences in LOS, mortality, or hospital costs, they found that time from Gram stain report to appropriate antimicrobial de-escalation or escalation was shortest in the BCID plus ASP intervention arm [9].

If a respiratory virus is detected and the illness is attributed to it, unnecessary antibiotics can be mitigated or discontinued early. In cases involving influenza A/B, RDTs may expedite treatment with antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir), potentially reducing the duration of the illness, although its impact on preventing clinical complications remains unclear [10]. Additionally, it is uncertain if detection of respiratory viruses other than influenza virus (e.g., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, the coronaviruses, adenovirus, and rhinovirus) using molecular tests in panel-based assays (rapid or batched format) translates into benefits at the patient level. As antivirals are not routinely used to treat these viruses, to derive clinical benefit from rapid testing, clinical teams would need to feel a degree of reassurance from positive results to expedite discontinuation of antimicrobials and discharge from the hospital.

Pre-implementation, a variety of respiratory viral tests were offered, including rapid antigen testing, the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex, Austin, TX), DFA, and viral culture on nasopharyngeal swabs, and in some cases, bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Following statistical adjustment for potential confounders, including age, immune status, asthma diagnosis, and admission to the intensive care unit, in the multivariate analysis, among patients diagnosed with influenza, LOS, duration of antimicrobial administration, and number of chest radiographs performed were reduced after implementation of FilmArray RP. The same phenomenon was not observed in patients in whom respiratory viruses other than influenza virus were detected [11]. The study ultimately suggested that while rapid diagnosis of influenza virus infection may have a positive impact on patient outcomes, rapid detection of other respiratory viruses may not lead to similar benefits and may call into question the need for panel testing of a broad range of respiratory pathogens.",

Prior to RP, a multiplexed LDT PCR assay detecting 11 viral targets was performed once daily, 7 days per week, for respiratory viral testing. Univariate analysis showed a mean reduction in antimicrobial days of 0.4 days that was statistically significant, but there was no change in LOS following implementation of FilmArray RP. Further, they reported that RP implementation reduced LOS only in patients with a positive result by FilmArray RP. This study suggested that a switch from batched PCR-based respiratory viral panel testing to a broader, rapid respiratory pathogen panel test may not robustly impact patient care or outcomes [12].

As with their use in positive blood cultures, for the management of encephalitis and meningitis, RDTs facilitate optimization of antimicrobials that have already been started.",

A CSF sample that rapidly tests positive for enterovirus in a patient with aseptic meningitis may be reassuring to a clinical team and lead to expedited discontinuation of antibiotics and acyclovir if the patient appears well. Similarly, HSV meningitis is common with primary genital HSV infection, and early detection could lead to the discontinuation of antibiotics but continuation of acyclovir. Conversely, in non-critical patients with meningitis, a negative result for HSV-1/HSV-2 may prompt discussion of discontinuing this nephrotoxic and neurotoxic antiviral. It is worth noting that in patients with encephalitis, the sensitivity of HSV PCR can vary, particularly early in the course of the illness [18]. In this context, clinicians may be reluctant to alter acyclovir therapy without repeatedly negative HSV-1/HSV-2 test results.",

However, data supporting the benefit of molecular RDTs in these cases are scarce. Using a retrospective quasi-experimental study design, Van and colleagues [20] recently described the effect of switching from the realStar alphaherpesvirus PCR kit, a multiplex PCR LDT that detects HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella zoster virus, (alTona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) that was performed once per day, 6 days per week, to the Simplexa HSV 1 and 2 Direct assay, which was performed on demand, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This study did not report any positive results, but among their 182 patients with suspected meningitis and/or encephalitis who were tested prior to rapid testing and 181 patients tested post-implementation, the study reported a decrease in the median duration of acyclovir therapy from 29.2 hours to 14.3 hours. The authors felt that, given evidence that renal toxicity and neurotoxicity typically occur within the first 48 hours of intravenous acyclovir administration, this reduction in acyclovir use associated with rapid HSV-1/HSV-2 testing had the potential to be clinically impactful [20].",

The drivers of patient satisfaction are complex, but a variety of different measurement tools have attempted to incorporate the key elements. Data derived from the federally administered Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey have suggested that patient satisfaction with discharge planning may be associated with lower 30-day hospital readmission rates [30]. More timely and accurate determination of the agent responsible for an infectious condition has great potential to enhance a clinical team's ability to formulate an ideal discharge plan and counsel a patient about the clinical course after discharge. However, this, too, needs evaluation, and any positive impact of rapid testing would need to be weighed against the costs that might be incurred by the patient for the testing.",

Interestingly, at least one manufacturer has attempted to offer more flexible use of their respiratory panel. Finally, in patients with meningitis or encephalitis, molecular technologies have greatly enhanced our ability to detect the responsible agents, but we do not appear to have sufficient evidence to assert that rapid (panel or duplex) testing improves patient care or outcomes. As others have stated previously, we need high-quality, adequately powered studies to determine the impact of available assays on health care processes and patient outcomes [31].
