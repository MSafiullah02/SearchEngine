Often when the septum narrows one side of the nose, it creates a larger space on the other side, into which the turbinate on that side expands. Medical management using topical nasal steroid sprays decongests the nasal lining and may lead to improvement in the symptoms of nasal blockage. However, such treatments are required on a daily, ongoing basis and in practice may not be successful. In addition, side effects of nasal dryness, irritation and bleeding may impact on treatment satisfaction and compliance. When surgery to straighten the septum is carried out, some surgeons also reduce the contralateral turbinate tissue. Potential complications of septoplasty include septal perforation, septal adhesions and bleeding [4]. Post-operative pain is common although this is reduced if sutures rather than nasal packing are used [4\u20136]. Patients typically are advised to take several days off work or usual activities after the operation. Septoplasty has no defined selection criteria, particularly in patients whose principal symptoms are sleep related, and clinical practice varies in different centres. The mode of action of septoplasty in sleep-related breathing disorders is not fully understood [7\u20139].",

Where septoplasty fails and further surgery becomes necessary, revision rates are reported to be high [14]. There is also a lack of robust evidence about the additional benefit of turbinate surgery [11]. One study showed reduced revision rates for septoplasty when the turbinate tissue is reduced [15]; other studies report no added long-term benefit from turbinate reduction [16\u201318].",

SNOT-22 is a commonly employed patient reported outcome measure in the assessment of patients with pathologies of the nose and sinuses [23\u201330] and was first applied to septoplasty in 2003 [31]. Our PPI work found that patient symptoms mapped better to the SNOT-22 than to the NOSE and that patients preferred the SNOT-22 measure. To maximise collection of primary outcome measure, participants who cannot attend the 6-month follow-up visit may complete SNOT-22 by post.",

Non-compliance (including receiving the alternative treatment) may be addressed using an \u2018as treated\u2019 approach or complier average causal effect (CACE) approach, since the intention-to-treat analysis under non-compliance is biased when the intervention effect is large [41].
