This will push many health systems to the point of rationing limited resources such as intensive care unit beds and life-sustaining machinery, as has occurred in Italy. 2 Patients and their families at the peak of the pandemic will face symptoms, emotional distress, and decision making in the face of uncertainty and limited options. No one is more prepared to handle these needs than providers on palliative care consult teams. However, palliative care consult teams are themselves a limited resource. In this piece, we will outline the challenges palliative care consult services may face in this crisis and suggest some alternatives forward.",

Teams should consider having talking points at the ready for needs that are likely to arise in the care of COVID-19 patients; such as management of cough, secretions, and shortness of breath; communication of triaging decisions; and management of family grief. If primary teams become overwhelmed with patients, palliative care consult services with the capacity can offset the responsibility of keeping patients' families informed. It is especially important to ensure families are informed when patients take a turn for the worse and/or die; in Italy, there have been instances where families were not informed of their loved ones' passing for days. 9 To facilitate the sharing of communication responsibilities, we recommend scheduled daily card flips with the directors of COVID-19 units in the hospital or the intensive care unit.",

Of course, palliative care providers should follow all standard precautions and refrain from physical touch, including noninfected members of patients' families.

This means that family caregivers will face greater burden, not to mention higher risk for COVID-19 if their loved one was infected.

The lack of a clear national consensus as to the criteria used to ration life-sustaining treatment will make decisions appear arbitrary, further compounding the challenge. Palliative care providers may be asked to be the bearers of bad news in this context and will be tasked to help patients and families cope with repercussions. Those palliative care providers who are perceived by the patient and family as part of the ''death panel'' who decided to not offer life support will have a very difficult time establishing the trust that is necessary to comfort patients and families and help them move forward. For this reason, we strongly recommend that palliative care teams not participate in the crafting of guidelines to ration care or in clinical decision making about the value of life-sustaining therapies for individual patients. More than ever, our patients and families need to view us as neutral. When there are questions regarding individual patients and the value of life support, palliative care providers can encourage the use of case conferences (where multiple experts discuss the specifics of an individual case and craft a recommended course) and ethics consultation.",

Providers should avoid terms like futility, which can promote an adversarial relationship with the family.
