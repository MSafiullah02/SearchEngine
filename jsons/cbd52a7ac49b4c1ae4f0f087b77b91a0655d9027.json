We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at a later epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay. Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number R 0 as T M /t, where T M is a constant and t is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic paramters. Note that although the model shows a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the real size of the pandemics as the relation of the observed reported data to the total number of infected in the population is still unknown.",

That in turn has serious consequences on pandemic spread control and efficient epidemiological decision making. Particular difficulty for mathematical modeling is that traditional compartment type models, often referred to as \"SIR models\" with Susceptible -Infected -Recovered compartments, that succeeded in an accurate description of previous epidemics, produce scenarios that do not match closely the observed data [5, 11] and fail to capture significant trends observed in data, see also [12, 13] for other early models. While it is still too early to call whether these models fail to capture the real dynamics of pandemics (as the observed data may not completely correspond to number of infected in the whole population) there is an urgent need to understand the available data and its relation to the SIR models.",

            "text": "We consider very important to emphasize the limited scope of our analysis as in the current literature some of these limitations are blurred and may eventually lead to misinterpretations. To overcome the difficulties with mathematical modeling and a high degree of uncertainty in data we propose a simple descriptive model that captures the dynamics of the observed data rather than a detailed mechanistic model of the pandemic dynamics in the whole population. Therefore our results need to be interpreted with high precaution. We only present a systematic mathematical description of the observed reported data. We provide neither an explanation of the pandemics spreading, nor any claim about the real scope of the pandemics. However, if one conjectures that the observed reported data capture the extent of the pandemic size in the real population (e.g., if data systematically report a fixed percentage of the total infected population), then our results can be used to identify the nature of the emerging trends in pandemics spreading in individual countries. Furthermore, we only model the first wave of the pandemic and we do not make any predictions about the extent and timing of next waves, although we discuss how our method can be used to study effect of next epidemic waves. We are aware that we ignore multiple key factors that may influence the relation between the observed data and the real epidemic size (the level of detection of infected by testing, delays in test reporting, variation in clinical aspects of the infection, etc.). Note that in the text we use the term COVID-19 for all reported infections based on a positive PCR test and thus we do not distinguish between the presence of the virus in the respiratory tract of an infected and the disease it causes. Through the whole text we model the time series of the total number of active cases that is the difference of the reported total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases.",

            "text": "We have identified a universal trend in the data reported by individual countries that helps to improve predictions for the final observed epidemic size and the related time scales. The universal trend is observed despite inhomogeneities and uncertainties in the data time series and various types and levels of mitigation policies applied. There is a transition in time series from an exponential growth (EG) to a polynomial growth (PG) and at a later stage to a combined polynomial growth with an exponential decay (PGED) in the number of active cases across almost all countries world-wide (with a sufficient size of current data). Our choice of the form of the trend in data is motivated by the theoretical results of [14, 15, 16, 17] and by the data analysis performed in [18, 19] that relate the observed transition to structural changes in the population contact networks. We analyze the reported data and estimate the parameters for individual countries. This allows us to categorize the countries into groups according to their advance through the first wave of the pandemics, and also to detect a possible divergence into a possible upcoming second wave in some countries. We rank a selected group of countries according to one of model parameters that captures their ability to identify, test, and isolate infected individuals from the rest of the population and thus prevent further spreading. We also provide a reconciliation of the PGED regime with the SIR model that allows to build PGED directly into existing SIR models despite the fact that PGED is inconsistent with the SIR models (in their traditional form). The PGED regime corresponds to an explicit algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number R 0 in time t in the form R 0 \u2248 T M /t with a constant T M . The trend is in general agreement with the current estimates of the evolution of R 0 in many individual countries [20] ; see also [21] for a data supporting the observed dependence. A model based on PGED regime can also aid forecasting of the future dynamics of the observed data including an analysis of eventual next epidemic waves.",

Therefore we refer to 6 as polynomial growth with exponential decay (PGED). It was derived for the size of the infected population by Vazquez [14] who used a branching process to describe the epidemic dynamics in a population interacting on a scale-free contact network. Ziff & Ziff [18] use the PGED scaling on reported COVID-19 data and claim that public measures and social distancing enforced yield a fractal type contact network on which the epidemic transmission is strongly limited by the network topology. We note that the polynomial growth models in the literature discussed in Section 4.1 can be also adopted to account for the exponential decay factor as well by an inclusion of a constant rate of loss from the infected population (similarly as in [16] ). We use 6 to match the observed pandemic data, particularly the number of active infection cases as reported in [27] . Note again that no prefactors are used here so the model only describes the dynamics of the reported data. The function I = I(t) in 6 has a maximum at t = T M = \u03b1T G where it reaches the value P = A(\u03b1/e) \u2212\u03b1 T \u22121 G . Note that the inflection points of the function I = I(t) are located at T \u00b1 I = (\u03b1 \u00b1 \u221a \u03b1) T G , particularly the time t = T \u2212 I plays an important role in the observed epidemic data as it corresponds to a moment at which the growth of the number of active cases reaches its maximum and starts to decrease. In the SIR model the ratio of the infected population at the inflection point (during the growth phase) and at the point of maximum is equal to 1/2. However, in 6 this ratio is given by \u03b1\u2212 \u221a \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1 e \u221a \u03b1 . This expression is equal to 1/2 for \u03b1 . = 6.23. For many countries we observe \u03b1 < 6.23 and thus the slowdown of the epidemiological curve (inflection point) occurs at (often at a significantly) smaller fraction of the population than predicted by the SIR model.",

However, we use non-rescaled values instead as the PGED trend is present only in later phases of the epidemic, particularly after the implementation of mitigation measures and social distancing (with a delay for its manifestation in the reported data). Using non-rescaled data allows us to globally fit the whole data set as the early epidemic data has only a small weight in the optimization due to its relative magnitude unlike in the case of the rescaled data. The fit thus does not require any prior (or fitting) for the time of transition to PGED. 2 In general, fitting polynomial growth to data is very sensitive to a choice of the origin of the fitted time series. Therefore we have set the data starting point in all considered countries systematically.

A smaller value of T G correspond to a fast decay after a country reaches its epidemic peak while large values of T G indicate very flat epidemic peaks and thus a very slow gradual decay of the active cases. In practice, T G is influenced by multiple factors, among them ability to identify, test and quarantine positive cases in the population and contact-tracing procedures play a prominent role. While a larger and better selected infection testing sample can significantly decrease T G in countries with a higher degree of epidemic, in countries with a small number of active cases finding and testing a small number of infected in the whole population can be very difficult. Therefore contact-tracing and a prevention of an import of infections from other countries can be the key measures to lower the value of T G . See Fig. 10 for the graphical display of the sorted values of T G for countries that are at or beyond the epidemic peak. Countries classified as undergoing the second wave are not included in the plot as a presence of apparent second wave may be eventually a sign of spurious data. Note that the countries that are currently close to their epidemic peak have higher values of T G than countries that are already further in the decay phase (with the exception of Jamaica). The data suggest that countries with a small values of T G (Mauritius * , Iceland, Ireland, Australia, Austria, New Zealand) are very efficient in testing and isolation of the individuals who will be tested positive thus preventing them for further spreading of the infection. On the other hand, the data for countries with large values of T G (Slovenia, Norway, Uruguay) do not show an indication of an efficient testing and isolation of infected (or they may not properly report recovered cases data). However, this interpretation needs to be taken with a caution with regard to the note of precaution in Section 1.1. Particularly, the interpretation of T G in countries marked with * in Fig. 10 and Tab. 1-3 can be influenced by the special adjustment of the time series mentioned in previous sections.",

For each choice of the number of withheld days we have calculated the 95% confidence interval for the inferred parameters by MATLAB c function nlpredci.m. Particularly, we were interested in the confidence intervals for the location of the epidemic peak and the number of active cases at the peak. Predictive power of the model can be visualized by plotting the bounding boxes corresponding to the confidence interval around the inferred location of the epidemic peak. A good model should provide a consistent position of the confidence intervals with smaller boxes indicating a large degree of certainty in the predictions.

When the inflection point (and the PGED regime) has not been reached yet, the information about an eventual exponential decay is not directly detectable in the data and the location and the value at the peak thus cannot be estimated, see the remark at the end of Section 6 for a discussion of a possible prediction improvement for countries in the PG phase, i.e., before they reach the PGED regime. We also illustrate two common situations: while for US, Italy and Portugal the prediction with less information underestimates the severity of the infection, for Czechia a forecast overestimates with less data.

For simplicity we match the data using the EG regime first (using the SIR model with inferred parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3). The simulation is initialized on March 1 (14 infected, 0 recovered, total population approx. 8.9 mil.). SIR dynamics is applied for the first 16 days reflecting the lack of measures in the early stages of the infection spread (note that the measures reflect in the reported data with a delay). After 16 days we match the rest of the data with PGED model (with inferred parameters P , \u03b1 and T M and a continuous R 0 ; the values are similar to the parameters for Austria reported in Table 1 ). We then continue PGED model until the May 31 (90 days after the considered initial date). The number of recovered during PGED regime period is calculated from the 3 and the number of susceptible as the complement of infected and recovered in the population.

We observe that an early implementation of the mitigation measures dramatically reduces the next epidemic peak. A qualitatively similar progress can be seen in case of imported infections (we add 30 new infected cases at the time of released mitigation measures). The numerical results indicate how essential is to implement mitigation measures as early as possible, which requires efficient tools for an early detection of infected individuals.

The observed universal scaling is a bit surprising as the pandemic mitigation and social distancing measures, the testing procedures and protocols, and many other aspects, vary significantly from one country to another. Nevertheless, the scaling appears to be a strong attractor of the reported active cases dynamics globally. An important feature of PG and PGED regime is that they both contribute to a slowdown of the epidemic growth in the reported data compared to expected dynamics driven by the SIR model. Note that we have only considered the active cases data but our preliminary data analysis confirms that the PG trends are present in the reported deaths and where available also in reported hospitalizations. Therefore we conjecture that the observed transition between the different regimes is comparable to phase transitions in physics, thus one expects that the universal scalings in data are a consequence of some unidentified fundamental properties related to the pandemic. Lack of the reliable and detailed data that would allow to discriminate between their eventual sources and a high complexity of the studied system that involves the virus/disease (its medical, chemical, and physical properties), behavior of individuals in population, and enforcement of the mitigation measures (see [2] for a summary of some related questions) do not allow to identify underlying factors for the observed PG and PGED regimes.

Ziff & Ziff [18] observed PG in total number of deaths in China. Similarly, Li & Deng [19] study COVID-19 data in mainland China and observe an evidence of PG in the form N (t) = At p with exponents p = 2.48, p = 2.21, and p = 4.26 in the total number of confirmed positive cases, confirmed deaths, and recovered cases, respectively. Szab\u00f3 [15] in a theoretical work explains the PG in the total number of infected by the topology changes in the contact networks that has a major impact on the final extent of the pandemic, see also[28]  for a survey of impact of network topology changes on COVID-19 pandemic parameters. Szab\u00f3 shows that the Barab\u00e1si-Albert preferential attachment contact network with two connections of each new node and a simplified SIR dynamics implies total extent of the pandemic at only 4% of the total population. That is a significant reduction from the levels expected from the SIR model universal timescale by accounting for the country-specific time delay. They suggest the PG is due to spatially structured population where the mixing between individuals is reduced. The metapopulation is modeled as a grid of patches with free mixing within each patch and contact with neighboring patches. No long-distance transmission is allowed in the model. Brandenburg [17] analyzed COVID-19 data from China and observed that the number of fatalities and infections growth rates estimates for individual countries, and suggested explanations of the PG regime.",
