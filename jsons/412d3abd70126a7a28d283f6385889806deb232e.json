            "text": "Viral lower respiratory tract infections (VLRTI) remain a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Although in the majority of people these infections are largely self-limited, in certain groups such as children, the elderly, those with chronic respiratory diseases, on mechanical ventilation in intensive care and immunocompromised patients (e.g., organ transplant recipients, those with AIDS or hematological malignancies), these infections can be fatal if undetected and not promptly treated. 2 For many years, the diagnosis of VLRTI was based on techniques such as viral isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody staining, and rapid enzyme immunoassay. Currently, nucleic acid based amplification techniques constitute the gold standard for viral detection due to advantages such as high sensitivity and specificity, rapidity, viral quantitation, rapid TAT, and increased cost-effectiveness compared to single PCR. 3 Radiological imaging and morphology also play an important role in diagnosing VLRTI. Exfoliative cytology provides a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and valuable means to diagnose and manage VLRTI. 4 Ancillary studies such as special histochemical and fluorescent stains, immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, and molecular studies can also be applied to cytology samples, thereby increasing their diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. 5 Sputum collection (spontaneous or induced), bronchial brushings, tracheal, or bronchial aspirations, bronchial washings, and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) can provide respiratory tract samples for diagnosis. For lesions that are centrally located and involve major airways, sputum samples and bronchial brushings/washings may yield diagnostic material, whereas a BAL may be more useful to assess infectious processes in lung periphery. Depending on the age and condition of the patient (e.g., ICU setting), each of these methods has its indications and associated limitations, advantages, and diagnostic accuracy. 6 Here we review the viral-associated cytomorphological changes seen in exfoliated cells of the lower respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Most changes related to viral CPE can be readily identified with routine stains Papanicolaou (Pap) and/or hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stains. In selected cases, special stains may be helpful. For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions are magenta when stained with a Feulgen stain and measles can be more easily diagnosed using Lendrum's phloxine-tartazine stain. More recently, immunocytochemsitry using monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1C ) and in-situ hybridization using designed probes have become commercially available to detect viruses (e.g., adenovirus, CMV, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and respiratory syncytial virus). Certain monoclonal antibodies (e.g., pan-adenovirus marker) may be reactive to all serotypes of a virus, whereas with others, viral subtypes may not be detected by specific antibody clones. Ciliocytophthoria (CCT) or \"detached ciliary tufts\" is a term coined by Dr Papanicolaou in 1956 to describe a degenerative change observed in ciliated bronchial cells in association with viral infection and bronchial carcinoma. [10] [11] [12] In sputum and other respiratory samples, CCT is recognized by the presence of cellular fragments without nuclei, presence of eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm, and cilia attached to a terminal bar ( Fig. 2A) . The presence of CCT in sputum smears may be mistaken for multiflagellated protozoa or ciliated parasites. 13, 14 In cytology samples from patients with a VLRTI, in addition to CPE, nonspecific findings such as intense cellular desquamation, cellular degenerative changes (e.g., nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis), an inflammatory infiltrate, and a granular or necrotic background (Fig. 2B ) may be observed. It is important to be aware that the malignant tumors, such as bronchial squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, can exhibit similar findings. As these viral infections are frequently found in immunosuppressed individuals, viral CPE may sometimes be seen together with other opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii.",

Although both types can affect the respiratory tract, HSV-1 is the most frequently associated with these infections. VLRTI is caused through close contact with an infected individual. Focal HSV pneumonia likely results from contiguous spread of herpesvirus to lung parenchyma, whereas diffuse interstitial pneumonia may be a manifestation of hematogenous dissemination of virus. While primary infection is often accompanied by a Table I .

One feature of HSV infection is reactivation from the sensory nervous system of latently infected humans, although all the triggers for this are not well defined. 15 Colonization of the lower respiratory tract by HSV may occur by means of aspiration from a reactivation of infection of the upper respiratory tract. HSV can infect the lower respiratory tract in both immunologically normal patients and the immunocompromised host. 16 VLRTI is mainly associated with necrotizing tracheobronchitis and bronchopneumonia. On CT scan, infection manifests with areas of diffuse or multifocal ground-glass attenuation and/or predominant areas of multifocal peribronchial consolidation. Predisposing factors for HSV tracheobronchial infection and pneumonia include immunosuppression, debilitation, severe burns, underlying malignancy, advanced age, and/or prolonged mechanical intubation. The latter has special relevance in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), usually reflecting viral reactivation during mechanical ventilation without lung parenchymal involvement. 17 ICU and hospital length of stay can be significantly longer in such HSVpositive patients. Disseminated HSV infection can also cause VLRTI in neonates.",

As with other herpes viruses, CMV remains latent within its host, reactivating and shedding when the host's immune system becomes compromised. CMV is spread by means of blood transfusion, organ transplant, respiratory droplets, saliva, sexual contact, and urine. Newborns, especially those with congenital infection, 21 and immunosuppressed patients such as those with AIDS and transplant recipients, 22, 23 are the most susceptible population. CT findings of CMV pneumonia are nonspecific. However, CMV pneumonia may rarely mimic malignancy, especially in patients who present with a cavitary lung mass. Infected lungs show interstitial pneumonitis with sparse mononuclear inflammation and characteristic nuclear inclusions. Cytological features associated with CMV include marked enlargement of infected cells with a large, homogeneous, round intra-nuclear inclusion (Fig. 4A) surrounded by a clear halo (creating an \"owl's eye\" appearance). There is also margination of chromatin toward the nucleus periphery. These inclusions may be observed in airway epithelium, alveolar pneumocytes, macrophages, endothelium, and interstitial cells. Small cytoplasmic granular, basophilic inclusions may also be observed aggregating near the cell membrane. Multinucleation may occur, but is a rare finding. With severe infection neutrophil infiltrates, necrosis, hemorrhage, hyaline membranes, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) may also be observed.",

            "text": "RSV is an enveloped RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family and Pneumovirus genus. Although RSV causes acute respiratory tract illness in people of all ages, it is the most common cause of lower respiratory infection in children younger than 1 year. 31 While healthy people typically experience mild, cold-like symptoms if infected and recover in a week or two. RSV can be serious, particularly in infants and the elderly. 32 High-risk groups such as premature infants, immunocompromised children, or those with chronic pulmonary disease or congenital cardiac disease are more likely to have a severe disease process, including bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia. RSV infection is considered to be a major public health problem and economic burden in most countries. 33 Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical links between RSV infection and asthma have been reported. 34, 35 Extensive neutrophil accumulation in the lungs and occlusion of small airways by DNA-rich mucus plugs are characteristic of severe infection, contributing to airway obstruction. 36 In autopsy series, the distribution of virusinfected cells ranged from clusters of cells in large cartilaginous airways to more circumferential infection of epithelium in the smallest airways. This suggests a viral tropism for cells of the distal airway, where there are more homogeneous cell populations, thereby allowing the virus to efficiently spread from cell to cell with significant syncytium formation (Fig. 5B) in bronchiolar epithelium. 37 The presence of large syncytial cell aggregates with indistinct eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions is typical of RSV infection in cytology samples (Fig. 5C ). It has also been suggested that that a high rate of \"Creola bodies\" in sputum (Fig. 6A ) may be present in infants with Diagnostic Cytopathology DOI 10.1002/dc RSV bronchiolitis, which are typically associated with disease progression to recurrent wheezing and asthma. 38 A Creola body is a rounded cluster of reactive ciliated bronchial epithelial cells. Other viruses that cause wheezing in children are rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza viruses. 39 The cytomorphologic differential diagnosis of RSV infection includes other viral infections such as human metapneumonia and measles, and reactive multinucleated bronchial cells with clusters of bronchial hyperplasia. Additional studies include the BinaxNOW RSV card test, an in vitro immunochromatographic assay used to detect viral antigen in nasal wash and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients, as well as PCR, shell vial culture, and tissue culture.",

While viral CPE can be pathognomic, morphological overlap among these infections does exist (e.g., giant cell formation and multinucleation). When examining lung cytology samples, it is important to be cognizant of potential pitfalls including mimics, especially cancer, as well as the presence of concomitant infections in immunosuppressed persons. Finally, as the field evolves, it is imperative for researchers to report findings of potential CPE with emerging VLRTI such as Avian Influenza A and Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",
