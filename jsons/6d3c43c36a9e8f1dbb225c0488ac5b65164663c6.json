            "text": "Patients and Healthy Individuals 14 of the 18 known IRAK-4-deficient patients were enrolled in our study, corresponding to 8 of the 11 known kindreds (see Introduction). 5 of these 14 patients died before our study was initiated, and the remaining nine were tested for IFN production and/or viral infection (serological testing, P1 to P9). IRAK-4-deficient patients P1 and P2 have been described elsewhere (Picard et al., 2003) . P1, a Saudi boy, died of pneumococcal meningoencephalitis shortly after this study was carried out, at the age of 7 years. P2 is a French boy of Portuguese descent, now 13 years old, with no ongoing treatment and asymptomatic chronic pansinusitis. Patient 3 (P3) is a 31-year-old British woman, currently well off all treatment despite occasional deep-seated staphylococcal abscesses (Chapel et al., 2005) . Patient 4 (P4) is a 5year-old Hungarian boy, doing well on prophylactic antibiotics and immunoglobulin substitution (C.L. Ku et al., submitted) . Patient 5 (P5) is an 8-year-old Spanish boy, doing well on prophylactic antibiotics despite occasional cutaneous staphylococcal abscesses (Cardenes et al., 2005) . Two IRAK-4-deficient third-degree relatives of this patient died of invasive pyogenic bacterial disease in childhood. Patient 6 (P6) is a 3-year-old Canadian child, of European descent, doing well on prophylactic antibiotics (D.S., unpublished data). His IRAK-4-deficient brother died of pneumococcal disease in childhood. Patient 7 (P7) is an 8-year-old Israeli child, who had pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis despite prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin. His sister died at the age of 2.5 months, from fulminant sepsis due to Streptococcus milleri (B.Z.G., unpublished data). Patient 8 (P8) is a 25-year-old Canadian of English descent who had multiple bacterial invasive infections during infancy and childhood, including meningitis, septic arthritis, and multiple abscesses (C.R., unpublished data). Patient 9 (P9) is the monozygotic twin of P8 and he too suffered from pneumococcal meningitis and upper airway abscesses. Both twins are now active and well off all treatment, but their sister died at the age of 5 months from bacterial meningitis. The patients suffered from invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (P8, P9) and Staphylococcus aureus (P8). The IRAK-4 mutations and clinical features of the patients will be reported elsewhere. All patients suffer from IRAK-4 deficiency, with impaired secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to TLRs and IL-1Rs. The patients have suffered from invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (P1-P9), Staphylococcus aureus (P1-2), and Shigella sonnei (P3). Although exposed to common viruses, such as ss(-)RNA RSV (P1-6), ds DNA human metapneumovirus (P1, P3-6), dsDNA EBV and VZV (P1-3, P5, P8-9), dsDNA HSV (P8-9), dsDNA CMV (P4-5), dsDNA HHV-6 (P1-6), ssDNA parvovirus B19 (P1, P3), and attenuated ss(+)RNA rubella virus (P1-4, P6), as shown by the positive results obtained in serological tests, they had not suffered from serious infections with these pathogens. P2, P3, P5, and P7 received live measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine with no adverse effect and tested positive for measles, mumps, and rubella viruses in serological tests. P4, P6, and P7 tested positive for mumps virus, and P1-P7 tested positive for coxsackie virus. In addition, most IRAK-4-deficient patients have probably been infected with at least other dsDNA viruses (papillomavirus, molluscipoxvirus, adenovirus), dsRNA viruses (rotavirus), ss(+)RNA viruses (enterovirus, rhinovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus), and ss(-)RNA viruses (influenza virus, paramyxovirus), which are almost ubiquitous and cause common childhood infections. Not all the patients in our study were tested, and we did not apply all assays to all the patients investigated. We also tested 11 healthy volunteers as controls: nine adults (aged 25-45 years) and two children (aged 9 and 13 years).",

The cells were incubated for 24 hr. Supernatants were then recovered and subjected to ELISA tests for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1.

For experiments with SV-40-transformed fibroblasts, we seeded each well of a 24-well plate with 10 5 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.

Cells were incubated for 24 hr and we then recovered supernatants and cell pellets for ELISA and real-time RT-PCR tests for IFN-\u03b2. Viruses were inactivated by UV irradiation for 7 min. Inactivation was documented by titrating the viruses on VERO cells (with a decrease in viral load of at least four orders of magnitude).
