            "text": "Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) interfere with DNA replication and transcription. Failure to remove ICLs can induce cell cycle arrest, cell death, and genome instability. The Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) is a DNA structure-specific nuclease involved in ICL repair via interaction with FANCI-FANCD2 complex [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. FAN1 may also have a repair function that is independent of proteins in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway of DNA damage response [5]. Importantly, FAN1 mutations are thought to lead to the renal disease Karyomegalic Interstitial Nephritis (KIN) [[6], [7], [8]]. FAN1 possesses both 5\u2032 flap endonuclease and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activities [2,3]. In cells, FAN1 functions in concert with or in parallel to other nucleases, including the endonucleases XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, SLX1 and the exonucleases SNM1A and SNM1B, to unhook ICLs [9]. SLX4 interacts with XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1 and SLX1 and recruits these nucleases to DNA lesions [9]. It is important to note that FAN1 is structurally distinct from FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1), which removes 5\u2032 RNA and DNA flaps during lagging strand DNA replication and long-patch base excision repair [10].",

These structures provide insights into how FAN1 binds 5\u2032 flap DNA with a 1-nt overhang (Fig. 1\nA and Fig. S1). Surprisingly, the two available structures of the hFAN1 differ both in the oligomerization state (dimer vs monomer) and DNA-binding mode. The dimeric structure has an interface with DNA that spans both hFAN1 protomers [11], while the monomeric hFAN1 structure largely resembles the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 (PaFAN1) bound to DNA [12,13](Fig. 1A, right panel). It is unclear whether the two hFAN1 crystal structures capture physiologically relevant oligomeric states of this enzyme in different substrate engagement/cleavage modes.",

This DNA-bound hFAN1 structure was derived from a truncated form of hFAN1 (residues 373\u20131017) that lacks the UBZ domain but otherwise covers all the essential domains for DNA processing and possesses nuclease activity comparable to that of full length hFAN1. We refer to this construct as WT hFAN1 or simply WT (Fig. 1A, left panel and Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, another published hFAN1 structure shows a monomeric conformation and a different mode of DNA binding [12]. This structure was similarly derived from hFAN1 (residues 364\u20131017) that lacks the UBZ domain but in addition harbors the deletion of a flexible loop spanning residues 510\u2013518 in the SAP domain, hereafter referred to as \u0394L hFAN1 or simply \u0394L (Fig. 1A, middle panel).",

Disruption of the dimer structure gives rise to the different DNA binding modes, especially at the SAP domain of the molecule (Fig. 1D), as observed in the two published X-ray crystal structures [11,12].

We found that the cleavage pattern for WT and \u0394L is the same for flap substrates that harbor a 5\u2032 overhang of either 1 nt or 5 nt (Fig. 2\nA, B), and nearly complete substrate cleavage occurs with both hFAN1 forms within 2 min. However, as the 5\u2032 overhang length was increased to 15 nt and then to 40 nt (Fig. 2C, D), the cleavage efficiency diminished significantly for both WT and \u0394L, albeit the activity drop on the 40-nt flap was much more pronounced for \u0394L than for WT. These initial assays were performed using the UBZ domain-deleted (\u0394UBZ) version of WT and \u0394L hFAN1, as the overall purification yield of the \u0394UBZ variant of these proteins was significantly higher than that of full-length hFAN1. To determine whether the UBZ domain exerts any influence on the flap nuclease activity of FAN1, we also expressed and purified full-length WT and \u0394L FAN1 proteins and tested them on the same flap substrates (Fig. 2E\u2013F). The results confirmed that while the \u0394L mutant is just as capable as the WT counterpart in cleaving the 1-nt flap, the latter is much more active on the 40-nt flap than the mutant (Fig. 2E right panel).",

These enzymes have SAP and VRR-nuc domains similar to hFAN1, but both lack the ubiquitin-binding UBZ domain found in the human counterpart (Fig. 3\nA, left panel). Firstly, we used size exclusion chromatography to confirm that PaFAN1 is monomeric with and without DNA being present (Fig. 3A, right panel). On the other hand, we found that VvFAN1 is dimeric regardless of whether DNA is present or not (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Next, we tested these two bacterial proteins in time-course experiments with the same series of 5\u2032 flap DNA substrates as what we used for hFAN1. The results revealed that PaFAN1 and VvFAN1 both have robust activity on substrates with 1-nt or 5-nt overhang, but increasing the length of the overhang to 15-nt or 40-nt leads to a reduction in DNA incision by both proteins, but with monomeric PaFAN1 being affected to a significantly higher degree (Fig. 3B\u2013E). This trend recapitulates our results from examining \u0394L hFAN1 and WT hFAN1.",

Intriguingly, these structures also raised the question about the relevant oligomeric state of FAN1 in human cells. In the present study, we provide data to clarify the major difference between dimeric and monomeric forms of FAN1 and to advance our understanding of the biological function of FAN1. Specifically, given the very different modes of DNA binding in the two hFAN1 structures, we predicted that a difference should manifest in DNA cleavage as well. Through testing a series of 5\u2032 flap DNA substrates, we found that as the ssDNA overhang length increases, the efficiency of cleavage by FAN1 is reduced and that this reduction is significantly more dramatic for the monomeric form of hFAN1 (Fig. 4\nA). To ascribe this activity difference to the oligomeric status difference of the protein, we also examined bacterial FAN1 orthologs that are either dimeric or monomeric. Importantly, by comparing the dimeric VvFAN1 and the monomeric PaFAN1 in the same nuclease tests, we have provided further evidence that the oligomeric status of FAN1 determines its efficiency in cleaving a long ssDNA flap strand.",

Our crystal structures of dimeric hFAN1 have provided evidence for \u201cscanning\u201d, \u201clatching\u201d and \u201cunwinding\u201d modes of DNA engagement stemming from the concerted effort of two FAN1 protomers [11] (Fig. 4B). We note that the VRR-nuc domains form a dimeric structure that can cleave the Holliday Junction in a symmetric fashion, but due to the insertion of a helix in the VRR-nuc domain of FAN1, the inherent dimerization property becomes impaired [14]. In this regard, certain FAN1 orthologs, particularly the human and Vibrio enzymes, have evolved another surface for protein dimerization where the SAP domain of one protomer associates with the VRR-nuc domain of a second protomer to generate an asymmetric dimer. This asymmetry underlies the ability of hFAN1 to cleave a long 5\u2032 flap strand. Thus, protein dimerization likely imparts plasticity to hFAN1 in the processing of damaged replication forks.",
