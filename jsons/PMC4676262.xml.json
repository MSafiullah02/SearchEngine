Influenza is thought to be spread by direct person-to-person transfer of infectious secretions, by indirect transfer of secretions via fomites, by large ballistic spray droplets that are produced during coughing or sneezing and splash onto mucous membranes, and by the inhalation and deposition of airborne virus-laden particles.(1) However, the relative importance of these routes of transmission is unclear and appears to depend on multiple factors, including temperature and humidity, the virus concentration in respiratory secretions, the distance from the source to the recipient, and the genotype of the virus.(2,3)",

Several studies have examined aerosol particle generation by people during coughing, speaking, sneezing, and breathing (reviewed by Gralton(8) and Nicas(9)). Most of these studies used healthy subjects, but a few have looked at aerosol production by individuals with respiratory viral infections, including influenza(10\u201312) and rhinovirus.(10,13) All of these studies have consistently found a tremendous variation in the numbers of aerosol particles expelled by individuals. Edwards et al.(14) tested 11 healthy subjects and reported that the concentration of particles in their exhaled breath varied from 1 particle/liter to over 10,000 particles/liter. Fabian et al.(11) tested 10 patients with influenza and found that the concentration of particles exhaled by these subjects ranged from 67 to 8500 particles/liter of air; similar results were later reported for patients with rhinovirus infections.(13) Almstrand et al.(15) also found that the exhaled particle concentrations varied considerably from subject to subject and with the depth of breathing, but that the exhaled concentrations for each subject were fairly consistent during repeated testing for each respiratory maneuver studied.",

Because respiratory infections generally increase airway mucus production, it is typically assumed that aerosol production also increases, but the actual amount of any change is unknown, and it is also unclear whether the particle size or distribution of the aerosol is shifted. The studies cited above that looked at particle production in individuals with respiratory infections also included healthy individuals in some cases, but because of the large interpersonal variability in aerosol production, it is impossible to know if any differences observed are due to illness or other factors.",

The cough aerosol collection chamber was fitted with an inlet port for the spirometer and two outlets. A Wide-Range Particle Spectrometer (WPS) (Model M1000XP; MSP Corporation, Shoreview, Minn.) was connected to the chamber to analyze the cough aerosols. The WPS includes a laser particle spectrometer (LPS) to measure larger aerosol particles and a differential mobility analyzer-condensation particle counter (DMA-CPC) to measure smaller particles. According to the manufacturer, the LPS detection range is 0 to 500,000 particles/liter, while the DMA-CPC detection range is 20,000 to 1010 particles/liter. Most of the cough particle concentrations were below the detection limit of the DMA-CPC, and thus, only the LPS data are reported here. A 32-L/min air pump (Model 1532; Gast Manufacturing, Benton Harbor, Mich.) was also connected to the chamber to remove particles from it between tests.\n",

The data were adjusted for the fraction of the sample flow stream that was counted by the LPS (0.7), the sample count time vs. the time for the total measurement cycle (30 vs. 51 sec), and the fraction of the air in the collection chamber that was sampled (5 of 20 L) to get the total number of aerosol particles and calculate the average number of particles/ cough. Because the data distributions are somewhat skewed, the average and the median of each data set are reported, along with the standard deviation, the geometric mean, and the geometric standard deviation (GSD). For the particle size distribution parameter calculations (count median diameter, volume median diameter, and GSD), the particle counts for each size bin were summed for all three coughs, and the parameters were calculated based on the summed counts. For each subject, the average results from all three coughs while ill were compared with the average results from all three coughs after recovery using a paired two-tailed t-test.

These larger drops fall very quickly (in fact, they were usually collected onto nearby settling plates during the experiments), while smaller droplets are capable of remaining airborne for an extended period. Thus, these results also illustrate the critical role of particle size in airborne disease transmission. At close range, larger drops can be important because of their greater volume and subsequent pathogen content, but as one moves farther away from an infected person, smaller particles may gradually become more important because they are able to stay airborne longer, reach more people, and are more easily inhaled.",

Our subjects were all symptomatic at the time of initial testing, but they were likely at different stages of their illness and some were more ill than others; both of these factors may influence aerosol production. Aerosol particles toward the upper limit of the WPS (10 \u03bcm) were more likely than small ones to deposit by impaction or settling before detection and thus may have been undercounted in our cough aerosol measurement system.

Further, many of these particles are in the respirable size fraction and thus can be easily inhaled and drawn down into the deepest parts of the lungs where they may be more likely to cause an infection. This enhancement in aerosol generation may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.",
