Beta\u2010coronaviruses like SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (the official name of COVID\u201019 virus) on the other hand are well adapted to their reservoir, the bat, but not to humans, which explains why human infections are so damaging. Other members of this family, the gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010coronaviruses infect birds and fish and, at least for the time being, have not been associated with human disease.",

The viral genomic sequence was then quickly shared and used to develop a detection test based on real\u2010time PCR for rapid diagnosis and for initiating epidemiological studies all over the planet. Now compare this with the years it took to identify HIV thirty years ago through conventional growing of the virus in in vitro culture. Molecular diagnosis has revolutionized this field, and despite the initial delays in communicating about this epidemic, Chinese doctors and biologists quickly reported the first evidence for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and provided the first sequences, clearing the way for the global scientific community to further develop diagnostic tools and engage in a race to discover dedicated drugs and vaccines.",

The S protein plays a central role for host specificity and pathogenicity as it binds to the ACE2 receptor on the target cell surface and mediates entry of the viral RNA. The phylogenetic tree shows that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is very close to SARS 2003 and MERS 2012, and the diseases they cause are very similar. The same is true for their origin: Bats are the main reservoir of coronaviruses. The phylogeny is therefore relatively well known, and one can apply the lessons learned during previous outbreaks, even if no vaccine or therapy is available so far.",

Human infection is abortive as the virus is not able to establish human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. Still, under this scenario, the disease can be very severe as was the avian influenza H5N1 caused by direct bird\u2010to\u2010human transmission, reaching \u02dc60% mortality, but for which limited, if any, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission was reported (Wang et al, 2008).2The virus is better adapted to its new host, thus better able to cross the species barrier, and its adaptation is facilitated by further mutations due to poor fidelity of the enzyme that replicates the positive strand of viral RNA. This is what happened with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, which jumped relatively easily from bats to humans via an intermediate mammal reservoir. The disease caused by SARS and MERS was more serious, and the mortality rates were higher (10% and 35%, respectively). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 however is often associated with milder pathologies. This is a typical trade\u2010off: less virulent, but more transmissible versus more virulent but less transmissible. This balance is extremely important and defines the disease profile.\n",

This was the case with Ebola in Africa, and with the Nipah virus in Malaysia, which appeared in the late 1990s. As human behavior changes ecological conditions, these bats increasingly come into contact with animals which are susceptible for a zoonotic species jump and which further replicate the virus. This generates a risk zone around humans, since any contact with these intermediate animals can cause another species jump into humans. In the case of SARS 2003, it is assumed that the intermediate animal was the webbed civet, a feline particularly frequent in Asia; for MERS, it was the camel. For Ebola, it probably was great apes (Malvy et al, 2019) while direct bat\u2010to\u2010human transmission was also considered (Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z et al, 2015).",

Not necessarily because the disease is more severe during this period, but likely because death count is indisputable, while it is difficult to assess the number of infections, which is always higher than observed. Undoubtedly, the majority of infected people develop a mild form of this disease, which makes accurate calculation of the mortality rate difficult at present. At the time of publication, mass serological testing is being rolled out in countries such as Germany, particularly in hotspot areas, which will give a much more accurate estimate of mortality rates. But the mortality rate increases due to the stress on the healthcare system and the availability of hospital beds. 1% mortality, 10% of severe cases, those are not large numbers statistically speaking, but compared to the number of infections, and taking into account the transmissibility and infectivity of the virus, we are reaching a situation that endangers our healthcare system.

            "text": "The future of the COVID\u201019 pandemic is in our hands. So far, we can only rely on prevention and symptomatic treatment of severe forms. Regarding prevention, health authorities have three main options. The first\u2014which may seem cynical\u2014considers that the more people become infected, the quicker the population will become immune until the epidemic peters out as the virus finds no more immunologically naive individuals. This is the principle of group/herd immunity. If 60% of the population were infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the epidemic will stop. But this would come at the cost of a very brutal epidemic peak with a high number of severe cases and deaths. We saw it during the epidemic of the Asian flu in the United Kingdom in 1957. For a week to ten days, the health system imploded, because the health personnel were sick, the equipment insufficient, and the number of seriously ill patients exploded. Totally opposite is the \u201cChinese approach\u201d: to isolate cities and individuals, which undeniably appears effective in controlling the epidemic. The risk is that because only few individuals have been infected, the attack rate was reduced due to strict confinement, hence many individuals are still immunologically naive and vulnerable to a second viral wave and risk an epidemic rebound. The intermediate option, which has been taken in most of European countries, is to flatten the curve over time with different levels of isolation and social distancing, hoping that even if less than 60% of the population will be infected, above all, the healthcare system will hopefully be preserved. The approach is based on a concept of social distancing (two meters/6 feet apart) and individual hygiene. It seems that in addition to airborne contamination, contaminated hands are also a major vector, either by direct contact with an infected patient, or indirectly by contact with a contaminated surface on which the virus seems to be able to survive for many hours. So, no kiss, no hug, no handshake and absolute hand hygiene. Avoid touching face unless hands have been thoroughly washed with soap or decontaminated with a hydro\u2010alcoholic gel. The importance of wearing masks for the general population is still debated in some countries that quickly ran short of these masks. In agreement with attitudes in Asian countries, wearing masks is now strongly advised to complement hygiene measures. Common sense starts to prevail.",

Confinement and isolation at home have therefore been decided for an extended period at the cost of a huge economic risk, given the intrinsic dynamics of the epidemic. Failure of these measures in these countries will have to be compared with their success in Asian countries like South\u2010Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and to a certain extent in Germany. Large implementation of diagnostic combined with isolation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive individuals may be part of the answer. No matter the strategy taken by health authorities, we need to convince ourselves that our fate is in our hands. We stepped into another world in only a few weeks.

The risk of rebounds justifies the absolute necessity of a vaccine that is the only way to achieve durable elimination of COVID\u201019 and even eradication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, including in low\u2010income countries with fragile health systems. Design, development, validation, clinical studies, and registrations with regulatory agencies takes between 8 and 12 years on average for a standard vaccine. This is incompatible with the urgency of an emerging epidemic like COVID\u201019. Fortunately, novel paradigms of vaccine discovery and development are on their way to considerably shorten the delays. Nonetheless, we know that we would not have a vaccine available until at least next year. In the meantime, in spite of enormous difficulties, we need a global mobilization for more basic and applied research from academia and the pharmaceutical and vaccine industry. As much as we have been able to massively reduce the time to identify novel pathogens, we need to reduce the time to develop the tools of their control. Again, our future is in our hands.",
