We established sensitive methods of REV detection, including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for REV-LTR and REV-gag genes, REV antigenemia measurements by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and virus isolation in tissue cultures. A variety of blood-sucking species of insects were trapped at farms with infected poultry and tested, but none were positive. To rule out the possibility of PCR inhibition by insect RNA, spiking experiments were conducted and no interference was observed. Because Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were trapped frequently at farms, we performed feeding experiments with mosquito females fed on a REV-containing tissue culture medium and chicken blood mixture. Virus was detected in the mosquitoes up to 5 h postfeeding, compared with 96 h in the feeding mixture, indicating that Cx. pipiens can only harbor REV for a short period. House \u00dfies were suspected to be involved in the virus transmission because they frequently were trapped on positive farms. In contrast to mosquitoes, REV was harbored within the house \u00dfy digestive tract for up to 72 h and could infect chickens, as demonstrated by seroconversion and by detection of viral gag-sequence in the cloaca.

The virus transforms B and T cells (Witter 1997) and is transmitted both vertically and horizontally among gallinaceous birds (Purchase and Witter 1995, Witter 1997) . The vertical mode of transmission from hen to chick occurs either via infection of the ovarian germ cells or contaminated oviduct. Horizontal transmission generally is the result of contamination of food or litter by infectious excretions from infected chickens or possibly by insects serving as mechanical vectors. This horizontal transmission occurs during the acute stages of infection (Peterson and Levine 1971 , Yuasa et al. 1976 , Bagust and Grimes 1979 , Bagust et al. 1981 , Witter et al. 1981 , Witter and Johnson 1985 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 172, "text": "(Witter 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 250, "end": 263, "text": "(Purchase and", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 264, "end": 289, "text": "Witter 1995, Witter 1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 681, "end": 706, "text": "(Peterson and Levine 1971", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 707, "end": 726, "text": ", Yuasa et al. 1976", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 727, "end": 751, "text": ", Bagust and Grimes 1979", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 752, "end": 772, "text": ", Bagust et al. 1981", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 773, "end": 793, "text": ", Witter et al. 1981", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 794, "end": 819, "text": ", Witter and Johnson 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reticuloendotheliosis virus"}, {"text": "Biting insects, such as mosquitoes, have been considered as mechanical vectors (Motha et al. 1984) .

Each week, an insect trap was set from dusk to dawn, and REV-positive insects were trapped from both groups. Interrupted feeding might have occurred resulting in the seroconversion of sentinel birds after being fed upon by partially fed females. Motha et al.

Chickens might be exposed to REV carried by the \u00dfies through eating them or by contact with open wounds on their bodies. To demonstrate the feasibility of the house \u00dfies to serve as an insect carrier of REV, we performed an experimental cycle of REV transmission from chickens to \u00dfies and back to other chickens. Because we showed the transmission of the virus from infected chicken to the house \u00dfies, the partial cycle was achieved, thus contributing to the knowledge on the avenues of REV horizontal spread in commercial \u00dfocks. 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 1/3 14 0/3 0/3 0/3 3/3 0/3 0/3", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Detection of reticuloendotheliosis virus infection using the polymerase chain reaction", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Aly", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Smith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Fadly", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1993, "venue": "Avian Pathol", "volume": "22", "issn": "", "pages": "543--554", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Experimental infection of chickens with an Australian strain of reticuloendotheliosis virus. 2.
