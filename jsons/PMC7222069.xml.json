            "text": "Determining the optimal timing for extubation of mechanically ventilated patients continues to be a challenge for clinicians. Extubating the patient too early may result in increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress or complications related to carbon dioxide (CO2) retention and hypoxemia [1, 2] Delaying extubation can increase the risk of developing complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia and ventilator induced diaphragm atrophy [3\u20135]. Using subjective measures alone to determine the timing of extubation can be fraught with error with the decision to extubate biased toward ventilator dependency [6]. Incorporating measures of tidal volume and breathing frequency into a rapid shallow breathing index aids in making the decision as to when mechanical ventilation can be discontinued [7\u20139]. However, these parameters are limited when subjects are assisted using pressure support [10\u201312].",

Both parameters have been used to determine the likelihood of extubation success. Ultrasound measures of the diaphragm dome evaluate its effectiveness in displacing the rib cage and abdomen, whereas ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the rib cage (ZOA) allow the clinician to directly assess diaphragm musculature. These prior studies indicate that diaphragm ultrasound can aid in predicting extubation success or failure; however, they do not address whether using diaphragm ultrasound can aid in decreasing the time to extubation. The aim of this study was to determine if incorporating results of diaphragm ultrasound into usual ICU care would shorten the time to extubation. In addition, we re-examined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of measures of percent change in diaphragm thickness between end-expiration and end-inspiration (\u2206tdi%) in predicting extubation outcomes.",

The diaphragm muscle was visualized as the echogenic space between the pleura and peritoneum as previously described [11].

The \u0394tdi% for each patient represented the mean of 3\u20135 breaths. Images were obtained within the first 5 to 10 min of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). One individual performed all the ultrasound exams at all sites. Only the right hemidiaphragm was examined because it is easier to visualize than the left in the ZOA due to the liver providing an excellent acoustic window [17].",

We noted a high prevalence of subjects with diaphragm dysfunction, as defined by a \u0394tdi% < 30%, in our study. Those individuals had a longer interval from ultrasound to extubation irrespective of being in the Intervention or Control group. In addition, we found that the PPV, NPV and ROC area for a \u2206tdi% \u2265 0.30% for predicting extubation outcomes was similar to those values reported previously for \u0394tdi% \u2265 20% and \u0394tdi% \u2265 30%.",

Absence of thickening with inspiration is consistent with diaphragm paralysis, whereas the presence of thickening by more than 20% is consistent with a functioning diaphragm. Clinical application of measures of diaphragm thickening include evaluating diaphragm function post-op, predicting extubation outcomes and documenting the presence of and recovery from diaphragm paralysis. It also has been used to determine the prevalence of diaphragm dysfunction in mechanically ventilated subjects, a condition which may occur within 36 h of the initiation of mechanical ventilation [4, 15, 18]. This condition may be prevented when the level of ventilator support is reduced to allow diaphragm thickening during inspiratory efforts [19].",

DiNino et al. found that a \u0394tdi% \u2265 30% had a PPV for extubation success of 91% in subjects undergoing spontaneous breathing trials with low levels of pressure support (PS of \u03945/5) [11]. Blumhof et al. reported similar results when extending these observations to levels of pressure support as high as \u039410/5 [12]. However, when PS was raised to \u039415/5, the PPV and NPV deteriorated significantly. At the lower levels of PS, a \u0394tdi% \u2265 20% predicted extubation success with a positive predictive value of 85% and extubation failure with a NPV of 75%. The current study echos these observations with similar values for PPV, NPV, and ROC area for \u0394tdi% \u2265 30%. By contrast, Vivier et al. found that \u0394tdi% was not useful in distinguishing between subjects who were and were not successfully extubated [19]. Their study differs from prior studies evaluating \u0394tdi% as their subjects were mechanically ventilated for at least one week (prolonged mechanical ventilation), were older (aged > 65 years) and were at high risk for re-intubation. In addition, they studied both hemidiaphragms and found unilateral dysfunction in 140 of 160 subjects [20].",

Nonetheless, diaphragm dome excursion also can be used to predict extubation outcomes. In general, diaphragm excursion during a spontaneous breathing trial of less than 1.0 cm is associated with extubation failure and excursion greater than 1.05 cm is associated with extubation success [14, 15, 21, 22]. Measurements of diaphragm excursion at 5 and 30 min of a spontaneous breathing trial may improve the specificity and sensitivity of this parameter [23] Dome excursion during spontaneous breathing trial has also been compared to dome excursion during triggered- assist/control ventilation [24]. The smaller the difference between diaphragm dome excursion measured during triggered-assist/control ventilation and breaths at 30 min of a SBT, the more likely the patient would be successfully extubated.",

These findings suggest that clinicians who incorporate US measures with other clinical and physiologic features may feel more confident and act sooner to extubate a patient.

There were more than twice as many subjects with diaphragm dysfunction in the intervention group (10/17) than in the control group (4/15). As expected, subjects with diaphragm dysfunction had a significantly longer time between ultrasound and extubation.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation stresses health care resources and increases financial expenditures related to the development of co-morbid conditions [25\u201328]. The hospital costs of subjects receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 96 h) in the United States of America as of 2003 were three times that for subjects being ventilated for less than 36 h. In addition, hospital length of stay was nearly triple for the prolonged mechanical ventilation and these subjects are less likely to be discharged home and more likely to be transferred to a skilled nursing care facility [26]. If diaphragm ultrasound can assist the clinician in extubating a patient sooner and reduce the ICU length of stay, this can result in considerable cost savings. A study evaluating the impact of an early mobility program in a trauma ICU suggested that a reduction in ICU length of stay of 1.31 days resulted in a cost savings of $8,239 per patient [29].",
