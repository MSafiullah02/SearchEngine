This was based on the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prioritize the use of N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures and surgical masks for care that does not involve such procedures. This is applicable given the current challenge faced by some centres with limited supplies of N95 and other respirators. Otherwise, the use of N95 or higher-level respirators should be used. In fact, this is the recommendation in our institution for performing RA in these patients as we recognize that RA reduces but does not eliminate the risk of spread of aerosols. There is also the potential need for emergent airway intervention during the surgery, or conversion to general anesthesia in the event of block failure or surgical complications.",

If needed for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia, supplemental oxygen can be delivered via nasal prongs under the surgical mask. Sedation should be used with caution (or not at all) to avoid worsening underlying respiratory impairment. If sedation were to be considered, dexmedetomidine may be suitable given its minimal effects on respiration.5 Respiratory rate can be monitored by clinical observation or electrocardiogram systems that use impedance plethysmography. For completeness, the options of modifying the existing oxygen delivery set-up were presented for readers considering continuous capnography monitoring, although this is not strictly needed. If used, oxygen flow through the face mask should be kept as low as needed to reduce dispersion. Also, avoiding interscalene block to minimize the risk of phrenic nerve palsy is paramount in a respiratory-compromised patient.",
