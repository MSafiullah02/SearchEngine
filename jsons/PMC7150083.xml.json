Genera contain from one to over a hundred species, usually defined by antigenic differences. The rationale for subdivision of genera into species is controversial. Most virologists agree that to be designated as distinct species, two viruses should differ substantially in nucleic acid sequence. However, there is as yet no consensus on how such differences should be quantified, and perhaps weighted. Antigenic differences are widely agreed to be of considerable importance. There is less unanimity about whether viruses distinguishable only by neutralization tests should be regarded as separate species, or merely as serotypes within a species. The effects of this ongoing debate on the designation of viral species should not be a major concern for the student, since we will use the common vernacular terms to distinguish viruses that cause different diseases.",

They were originally drawn up for bacteria and protozoa, not viruses, and were revised in 1937 by Rivers, who developed a modified set of criteria to cover viruses. With the advent of cell culture for viral diagnosis in the early 1950s, a large number of new viruses were discovered. Many were not associated with disease and were referred to as \u201corphan\u201d viruses or \u201cviruses in search of disease.\u201d Later the problem arose of determining whether viruses were causally involved in various chronic diseases including cancer, a problem that is still of major interest. Since the relevant disease may not be reproducible by experimental inoculation of animals, virologists have had to evaluate the probability of \u201cguilt by association,\u201d a difficult procedure that relies to a significant degree on epidemiological and serological methods.",
