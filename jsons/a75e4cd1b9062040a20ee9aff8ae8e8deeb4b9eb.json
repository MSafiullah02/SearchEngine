            "text": "Purpose: This study describes the phenotypic consequences of a frameshift mutation in the Retinitis Pigmentosa 1 (RP1) gene in Normande dairy cattle. Methods: Thirty animals from an experimental facility 4 (n = 17) and a private farm (n = 13) were selected for ocular examinations. These included 7 homozygous affected (mean age 4.7 years [1-8]), 11 heterozygous (mean age 5 years [2][3][4][5][6][7][8]), 12 homozygous normal animals (mean age 4.1 years [1][2][3][4][5][6]). The exams included menace response, dazzle and pupillary light reflexes, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy with a 30 D and a 20 D lens. Electroretinography was performed on one normal (homozygous wild type) and one affected (homozygous mutated) adult cow. Results: Among the homozygous mutated cows, animals over 4 years old (n = 5/ 7) presented with bilateral signs of retinal degeneration (hyperreflective tapetal area, diminished retinal vasculature). Two of them showed marked visual deficits, one was blind. Among the heterozygous animals, 8 presented with fundi within normal limits, 2 had moderate signs of retinal degeneration with preserved vision, and one was bilaterally affected with retinal degeneration and blindness. All the homozygous non-affected animals had fundi within normal limits, except one which presented with bilateral retinal degeneration and preserved vision. Full field electroretinography showed a complete absence of response in the homozygous affected cow and a normal response in the control. Conclusion: This study documents the pathogenicity of the frameshift mutation in RP1 in homozygotes. Further studies are needed to investigate a potential effect in heterozygotes and to eventually map additional loci affecting vision in Normande dairy cattle.",

The scAAV capsid variants carried the eGFP reporter gene under the control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter. Two to 8 weeks post intravitreal delivery, retinal distribution and cell tropism were examined by cSLO imaging and/or by immunohistochemistry. Results: Eyes with PPV had no transduction of retinal cells with the LiGluR transgene. Retinal puncture improved transduction of RGCs, but LiGluR expression was limited to RGCs immediately surrounding the retinotomy sites. scAAV capsid variants targeted RGCs, and M\u20ac uller cells, however, photoreceptor and RPE transduction was variable. Conclusion: A possible cause for the lack of transduction of retinal cells in vitrectomized eyes could be an accelerated clearance of the AAV. Mechanical puncture of the ILM favored AAV transduction of RGCs but pan-retinal biodistribution was not achieved. The directed evolution approach converged towards two AAVs that infect RGCs and M\u20ac uller cells; testing of other capsid variants that can efficiently target the outer retina following intravitreal delivery is currently on-going.",

The purpose of this study was to further characterize the loss of rod function in affected dogs. Methods: Homozygous Cngb1 mutant dogs (Cngb1 m/m ), age and breed matched controls (Cngb1 m/+ or Cngb1 +/+ ) and age matched dogs homozygous for a null mutation in CGMP phosphodiesterase alpha subunit (Pde6a -/-) were studied. Both dark-and light-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) intensity series were performed and compared. Results: Pde6a -/puppies had no detectable rod responses at any age: the same flash intensity stimulus in scotopic and photopic conditions resulted in ERGs of similar amplitude, apart from at lower flash intensities. However, the light-adapted cone responses were faster than the dark-adapted responses. At 5 weeks of age only cone-mediated ERG responses were present in Cngb1 m/m puppies (dark-and light-adapted ERG amplitudes were similar), but by 7 weeks rod responses with increased threshold, reduced amplitudes and markedly increased implicit times (especially at lower flash intensities) had developed. The rod responses slowly declined with age but were apparent until over 1 year of age. Conclusion: Cngb1 m/m dogs develop rod responses later during retinal maturation than normal controls. The rod responses have an increased threshold and notably delayed timing. We hypothesize that low levels of Cnga1 can provide sufficient cGMP-gated channel activity in rods of Cngb1 m/m dogs for a delayed and partial hyperpolarization of outer segments in response to phototransduction.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of full field ERG recording in the dog, utilizing gold cup electrodes. Methods: Electroretinography responses were recorded from eight healthy privately owned dogs. All dogs had a complete ophthalmic examination including slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. The ERG responses were recorded utilizing gold cup electrodes as well as needle electrodes. The ERG traces were evaluated offline, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Comparison of the b-wave amplitudes of the rod, combined rod/cone, and flicker responses was performed between traces recorded with gold cup and needle electrodes. Results: Ophthalmic examination findings for six of the eight dogs were unremarkable. Some fundic changes were found in two of the dogs. All recorded responses were of good quality for traces analysis. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) between b-wave amplitudes of traces recorded using the gold cup or needle electrodes.

Methods: Ophthalmic examination including at least slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed in 23 FCRs in Sweden. Eleven FCRs (10 males and 1 female; mean age 4.2 AE 2.4 years) were diagnosed with uni-or bilateral chorioretinopathy. The ocular fundus was considered to be normal in 12 dogs (six males and six females; 4.3 AE 1.5 years). Western blotting was performed with serum from healthy FCRs and FCRs affected by chorioretinopathy using canine retinal extract as antigen source. Blots were evaluated for presence of autoantibodies specific to retinal proteins. Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences between affected and healthy FCRs in the presence of individual specific antibodies. Results: Thirteen different anti-retinal autoantibodies were found in 10 dogs (nine males, one female) diagnosed with chorioretinopathy and four dogs (one male, three females) without ophthalmoscopic signs of retinal disease. Five autoantibodies binding to retinal antigens with apparent molecular weights of 23-, 36-, 46-, 132-and 136-kDa, respectively were significantly associated with chorioretinopathy. Conclusion: Chorioretinopathy in the FCR, a condition that mimics Working Dog Retinopathy, is associated with presence of circulating anti-retinal autoantibodies. An X-linked predisposing, genetic factor is possible because of the overwhelming majority of affected male dogs. Support: Supported by the Agria and SKK Research Foundation.",

Methods: The COPLOW database was searched and 22 submissions of ocular tissues from chameleons. These specimens were reviewed in an effort to record distinctive anatomic features. Results: Chameleon eyes are adapted to maximize image resolution and to achieve both monocular and binocular depth perception. They possess a unique negatively powered lens, which moves the focusing nodal point far forward of the center of rotation. This means that the position of an image on the retina is useful in judging distances. Accommodation is entirely corneal by means of a unique ciliary muscle. An extremely thin and malleable cornea facilitates corneal accommodation. The central retina is almost entirely devoted to a single, wide fovea. Active and independent eye movements ameliorate the resultant tunnel vision. Although each eye is capable of independent distance judging, the predatory capture of insects with the projectile tongue is achieved with binocular stereopsis. Conclusion: Chameleons are predators hunting and feeding on insects, which they catch with their projectile tongues. This is a strategy, which requires specialized and unique visual abilities including optical scanning of the environment, a high degree of visual acuity, and phenomenal abilities in visual depth perception. We present ocular anatomic features by which chameleon vision has adapted to achieve these needs.",

Methods: Eleven healthy Bengal cats (seven females, four males) had an ophthalmic examination including a vision assessment, biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy and tonometry. Eight of the cats were related. The cats' ages ranged from 3 months to 3.5 years. Results: All the eyes were visual. All globes and lenses were normal in size, shape and position. The corneas were clear and avascular. Gonioscopy revealed normal pectinate ligaments in all the eyes. IOP readings ranged from 14 mmHg to 19 mmHg. All cats exhibited bilateral nuclear and/or perinuclear cataracts in various shapes. Two cats had posterior polar cataracts, three cats had linear cataracts and six cats had arcus-shaped cataracts of the posterior nucleus. Eight cats had perinuclear cataracts. Posterior nuclear lesions were located where secondary fibers met at the Y sutures, close to the embryonic nucleus. Perinuclear opacities were diagnosed frequently (15/ 22 eyes). The vitreous and the fundus were normal for each cat. Conclusion: Presumed congenital feline cataracts are rare (Birman, British Shorthair, Himalayan, Persian kittens) and not described in the Bengal breed. When looking at the genealogy, the condition seems to be recessively inherited but specific test matings must be performed. Further clinical examinations and genetic studies are underway.",

Methods: A total of 66 Russian Blue cats were examined, during a 10-month period in 2014 in Sweden, using standard examination methods according to the SSVO/ECVO scheme for eradication of presumed inherited eye disease of dogs and cats. The examined cats were between age 3 months and 14 years. Pedigrees were collected for genetic studies from all examined cats, and buccal swabs for DNA extraction were collected from affected and from normal cats (>7 years old) for future molecular genetic studies. Results: Mild to severe forms of mainly bilateral cataracts were observed in 22 cats of both genders. The most typical form of cataract observed was a small triangular opacity at the border of the posterior nucleus and the anterior part of the posterior cortex. Six of the 22 cats had more extended forms, with involvement of both the entire nucleus and parts of or the entire anterior and posterior cortex. The latter forms were causative of visual impairment. Pedigree analyses indicated an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the defect. Conclusion: The seemingly high prevalence of a bilateral, specific type of cataract in the breed suggests that the cataract is inherited. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate whether the opacities are congenital or acquired and if there is a relationship between the various forms of cataracts in the breed.

The clinical findings of bilateral multifocal retinal dysplasia in a dam led to the ocular examination of the stud and the litter. Multiple congenital ocular anomalies of this family are described. Methods: All dogs were examined following the ECVO eye scheme and the horizontal corneal diameter was measured (mm) in the awake animals using a caliper. Results: The dam (34 months, ruby) was affected by multiple distichia and bilateral peripheral tapetal multifocal retinal dysplasia. The sire (27 months, black and tan) had unilateral iris to iris persistent pupillary membranes. Pup #1 (female, 2 months, ruby) had bilateral multifocal and geographical retinal dysplasia characterized by a horseshoe-shaped area in the right dorsolateral tapetal periphery and a circular dysplastic lesion in the left dorsomedial tapetal periphery. Pup #2 (male, 2 months, black and tan) showed bilateral microphthalmia (11 mm OU) with nuclear, cortical and posterior capsular cataract and right posterior lenticonus. Pup #3 (male, 2 months, black and tan) had bilateral iris to iris persistent pupillary membranes and unilateral right multifocal and geographical horseshoe-shaped retinal dysplasia. Conclusion: Microphthalmia with lens dysmorphogenesis and normal looking fundi seems to be a feature in the CKCS. Littermates may be affected with varies forms of retinal dysplasia, as in the Akita and the Chow Chow.",

Methods: Twenty-five dogs and three cats with corneal ulcers affecting more than half of the corneal thickness as observed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, two dogs with corneal perforations and seven cats with sequestra were included. The necrotic material was removed by keratectomy. The collagen graft (Acellvet \u00e2 ) was sutured into the keratectomy bed using a continuous suture pattern of Polyglactine (9-0). A nictitating membrane flap (NMF) was placed to protect the cornea and to prevent graft dehydration. Post-operative treatments consisted of topical tobramycin, atropine and systemic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The NMF was removed on day 7 for the 9 most severely affected corneas for complete evaluation. The NMF was then replaced. On day 18 the NMF was removed in all cases. All patients were examined on days 7, 18, 45, 90. Epithelialization of the biomaterial was monitored using fluorescein. Results: In two dogs, a conjunctival graft was performed at day 7 to cover the biomaterial graft, because of progression of a collagenolytic process. Epithelialization was complete at day 18 in 34/37 cases. Corneal opacity was dense in eight eyes, moderate in 21, and absent in 6 at day 90. Vision tests were positive in 35 eyes. Conclusion: The results of our study are comparable to those of other studies describing the use of other collagen xenografts in the surgical management of corneal defects of various origins.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the imaging capabilities of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) during surgical management of feline corneal sequestrum and to assess whether measurements of the quantitative parameters such as sequestrum thickness and corneal thickness, were possible. Methods: The study was conducted in a private practice referral center. Forty-five patients (52 eyes) with corneal sequestrum underwent lamellar keratectomy and corneal reconstruction with selected techniques such as porcine urinary bladder acellular matrix graft, bovine pericardium graft or pediculated conjunctival graft. SD-OCT scanning was performed with an Optovue iVue device at each step of the surgical procedure to assess the presence of residual sequestrum material and stromal thickness and at 7, 21 and 60 days after surgery to evaluate the corneal healing. Results: Corneal sequestra were seen as a hyperreflective and IR beam-absorbing area on the surface of the corneal stroma on high-resolution OCT scans. Repeated scans during the manual keratectomy procedure allowed the total removal of the abnormal cornea and influenced the choice of the corneal reconstruction biomaterial according to the residual stromal thickness. Normal and abnormal corneal healing were also evaluated. Conclusion: SD-OCT imaging provides a range of quantitative parameters that can be used to assess feline corneal sequestra and that can help to objectively select the most appropriate treatment options during surgical management and follow-up.",

Methods: Complete physical and ophthalmic examinations were performed and corneal scraping for cytological analysis and samples for bacterial and fungal cultures were taken. Results: At the initial examination, an ulcerative keratitis with multifocal dot shaped, whitish, raised stromal infiltrates, and a deep stromal arc-shaped abscess was observed. Two days later, despite intensive medical treatment with topical antibiotics, heterologous serum, and systemic NSAIDs, the ophthalmic signs worsened. Individual infiltrates coalesced to form a dense, whitish/yellowish, elevated and fluorescein-positive plaque. The abscess progressed to a 360\u00b0c ircle and hypopyon was present. The fungal origin was confirmed 2 days later from culture results identifying the organism as Aspergillus fumigatus. Antifungal treatment with terbinafine 1% dermatologic ointment four times a day was initiated. Considering the few available topical antifungal drugs for veterinary use in France, the choice of terbinafine was based on its broad-spectrum activity, its efficacy in human fungal keratitis and equine keratitis (personal communication) and for financial and availability reasons. At the last follow up, 8 weeks after the initiation of antifungal therapy, complete clinical resolution of the corneal lesions was observed. A control fungal culture was negative.

Tear fluid collected from pugs using Schirmer-Tear-Test strips was categorized according to severity of the associated corneal disease (none, mild, moderate, severe). 2Dgel-electrophoresis of selected samples was performed. Protein spot patterns obtained with fluorophore or silver-staining were evaluated using ImageMaster-2D-Platinum-software. Spots of interests were analyzed using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, cross tab analysis and Chi 2 Test. Fifty-four diseased pugs, 24 healthy pugs, and 11 brachycephalic dogs of various breeds were included. Mean ages were 3.11, 3.58, and 5.5 years respectively. Eyelid tissue of 21 pugs and 11 brachycephalic dogs was obtained. Results: Pugs had a higher number of inflammatory cells in eyelid tissue than other brachycephalic breeds, however, the difference was not significant. Up-and down regulation of 16 spot concentrations in accordance with disease severity was noted in tears of pugs. Mass spectrometry identified 11 proteins in pugs. presented with a slow growing mass on the left lower eyelid and nasal canthus. Ophthalmic examination was performed using a slitlamp, direct ophthalmoscope and applanation tonometer. Results: Ophthalmic examination revealed a 8 9 4 mm gray to pink, friable mass involving the eyelid margin, palpebral conjunctiva and third eyelid of the left eye. The remaining ocular and physical examinations were unremarkable. The seal was anaesthetized and swabs for cytology, bacterial culture and PCR (herpes virus, papillomavirus, parapoxvirus and poxvirus) were collected from the affected locations. The mass was debulked and excisional biopsies were taken for histopathology and PCR testing. Affected areas were treated with cryosurgery. Subcutaneous cefovecin sodium was given perioperatively. Postoperative treatment comprised of topical dexamethasone, neomycin/polymyxin B eye drops, carbomer eye gel and oral carprofen. On re-examination, 3 weeks afterwards there was complete wound healing without signs of mass regrowth. Positive PCR results were obtained for otarine herpesvirus (OtHV)-1. New treat-ment was started using topical antiviral ganciclovir eye ointment and oral famciclovir (7 mg/ kg/day) for 3 weeks. Seven months after surgery recurrence of the mass was noticed in the same location that subsided after repeated topical and oral antiviral therapy. Conclusion: Neoplasia of eyelids and conjunctiva of pinnipeds is rarely described. Oral famciclovir and topical ganciclovir seem to be an effective treatments for OtHV-1 induced ocular papilloma in seals.",

Results: Seventy one of 210 (33.8%) BH, 29 of 170 (17.1%) FCR and 20 of 101 (19.8%) DDT were affected by goniodysgenesis. The prevalence of goniodysgenesis was significantly higher in BH than both FCR (P < 0.001) and DDT (P = 0.01). In all breeds there was a significant association between goniodysgenesis and age (P \u2264 0.006). In the BH only there was a significant association between goniodysgenesis and sex (P = 0.003). In the DDT only there were significant associations between IOP and both goniodysgenesis (P = 0.006) and age (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The association between goniodygenesis and age is probably explained by the progression of goniodysgenesis over time, accounting for the fact that the prevalence of goniodysgenesis remains high in all 3 breeds, despite widespread screening. The associations between goniodysgenesis and sex in the BH and between IOP and both goniodysgenesis and age in the DDT are novel findings and warrant further investigation. Support: Dogs Trust.",

(ii) To investigate possible associations between the degree of goniodysgenesis and age, sex and intraocular pressure (IOP). (iii) To investigate possible associations between IOP and age and sex. (iv) To investigate the progression of goniodysgenesis in individual dogs over time. Methods: Gonioscopy and rebound tonometry were performed in both eyes of 221 Welsh Springer Spaniels (80 males, 141 females). The percentage of iridocorneal angle affected by goniodysgenesis was estimated and classified as unaffected (<25%) or affected (\u226525%). Progression of goniodysgenesis over time was investigated for 90 dogs which had had gonioscopy performed twice and were unaffected at their initial examination. Results: Of the 221 dogs, 67 (30.3%) were affected with goniodysgenesis. There was no association between goniodysgenesis and sex or IOP. There was a significant association between goniodysgenesis and age (P < 0.001). Of the 90 dogs classified as unaffected at their first examination, 38 (42.2%) were affected at the second examination; progression over time was significant (P < 0.001). The median time between the two examinations was significantly different (P = 0.006) between affected (median = 78.9 months, range = 11.6-139.6 months) and unaffected dogs (median = 54.5 months, range = 4.2-126.8 months). Conclusion: Prevalence of goniodysgenesis remains high in the Welsh Springer Spaniel, despite widespread screening and selection against the condition. Our data indicate this is because goniodysgenesis can progress in this breed and dogs that are unaffected at a young age may develop goniodysgenesis in later life. Support: Dogs Trust.",

Methods: Complete ophthalmic examinations associated with pharmacological testing and MRI were performed in all cases. Results: All three cases of this series were diagnosed with external ophthalmoplegia of the right eye through ocular examination. Cases 1 & 2, also presented with right internal ophthalmoplegia. The MRI finding for these two cases was a contrast enhancing mass at the junction between the right diencephalon and the midbrain in the area of the emergence of the oculomotor nerve. Concomitant neurological deficits of the right ophthalmic and mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve were observed for case 3, suggesting a cavernous sinus syndrome. MRI revealed for the latter a diffuse contrast enhancing thickening of the trigeminal nerve from its origin to the division into its three branches.

Methods: Ocular ultrasonography was performed on 108 dogs (169 eyes) before phacoemulsification. Lens diameter (LD) and axial globe length (AL) were measured retrospectively on still images obtained at 10 MHz (AL and LD10) in all dogs. Ultrasonography examination was repeated with a 20 MHz probe in 26 dogs (38 eyes) and with a 35 MHz probe in 28 other dogs (50 eyes) for lens diameter measurement (LD20 and LD35). Each observer (A and B) measured the parameters independently. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were used to assess intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility for AL, LD10, LD20 and LD35 measurements. Intraobserver repeatability was assessed by comparing measurements obtained on the same image on four different occasions by observer A. Interobserver reproducibility was assessed by comparing measurements obtained by both observers on the same image. Results: CVs used to assess intraobserver repeatability were considered very low to intermediate (1.2% for AL and <5% for LD10, LD20 and LD35) for observer A. CVs used to assess interobserver reproducibility were also considered very low to intermediate (indiscriminate results AL and <7% for LD10, LD20 and LD35). Conclusion: Intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility are good for lens diameter and axial globe length measurements at 10 MHz and for lens diameter measurement at 20 MHz and 35 MHz, in dogs with cataracts. High frequency B-mode ultrasonography can be useful to estimate lens diameter and axial globe length in dogs with cataracts.",

SIS refers to traumatic inoculation of bacteria into the lens cortex and development of lenticular abscess following capsule rupture, resulting in a delayed-onset endophthalmitis and glaucoma. Method: A 3-year-old male, intact, Golden Retriever was referred to EYECARE Clinic 2 days after a cat claw injury to the right eye. Examination revealed a corneal perforation, a 3 mm lens capsule rupture and mild anterior uveitis. Due to good response to medical treatment, the owner declined lens removal. During the following month the corneal ulcer healed and the anterior uveitis resolved. The eye remained quiet on bimonthly rechecks. Eight months post presentation the dog showed acute severe blepharospasm. On examination, a whitish swollen lesion in the lens and severe uveitis were diagnosed. Cytology from aqueous humor aspirate revealed neutrophils. Bacteriology was negative. A tentative diagnosis of SIS was made. Following aggressive medical treatment for 2 days the uveitis improved but the lens lesion remained unchanged. Since lenticular abscess was suspected the dog underwent lens removal. Lens capsule histopatology revealed severe supportive inflammation and Gram stain was positive for Gram+ bacteria, confirming the diagnosis of SIS. Results: Following surgery, the eye improved dramatically. Seven months post-surgery, the dog was visual, pain free with no clinical sign of uveitis. To determine the utility of manual epilation under topical anesthesia as a practical treatment for ectopic cilia. Methods: Twenty-two eyes of 21 dogs diagnosed with ectopic cilia by slit lamp biomicroscopy were evaluated retrospectively. All dogs were treated with topical proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% and underwent manual epilation using cilia forceps. Treatment success was defined as lack of documented or reported ectopic cilia regrowth for at least 3 months. Results: The median age at presentation was 21.5 months (range: 4.5-163 months). Overrepresented breeds included the English Bulldog (n = 6) and Shih Tzu (n = 5). Thirteen of 22 eyes showed no recurrence during a median follow-up time of 12 months (range: 4.5-48 months). The median time for recurrence in the remaining nine eyes (eight dogs) was 29 days (range: 10-143 days). Four eyes of three dogs ultimately underwent en bloc surgical excision of their ectopic cilia. Three eyes were treated by manual epilation one additional time and have shown no recurrence over a follow-up time of three to 29.5 months. One dog was treated by manual epilation an additional two times and has shown no recurrence over a follow-up time of 21.5 months. The remaining dog had multiple recurrences of ectopic cilia and underwent repeated manual epilations until it was lost to follow-up 20 months after the initial treatment. Conclusion: This study supports manual epilation as a practical treatment for ectopic cilia.",

This is likely to be the first report of a dysontogenetic orbital cyst in a dog (induced by defective embryonic development). Case: A 1-year-old male American Bulldog was presented for a progressive swelling of the nasal aspect of the left eye of 4 months' duration. Clinical examination revealed an elastic swelling of the left nasal canthus area with orbital involvement. The left nasolacrimal duct was obstructed. Computed tomography showed a large orbital cyst with thinning of the adjacent bony structures and periosteal reaction. Fine needle aspiration revealed 20 mL of an opaque brown fluid with non-diagnostic cytologic findings and negative culture results. Repeated injections of the sclerosing agent polidocanol (Aethoxysclerol \u00e2 ) into the cyst were not effective. Hence a transfrontal orbitotomy was performed 6 months after initial presentation. The entire cystic structure could be removed. Recovery was uneventful. Postoperatively the eye movements were not impaired and the eye remained visual. The left nasolacrimal drainage system continued to be obstructed. Four months after surgery there was no recurrence of the cystic structure. Upon histopathological evaluation the cystic wall contained scarce fibrocytes with abundant collagen fibers with occasional osseous metaplasia. The cyst lumen was lined by a cuboidal to cylindrical, non-ciliated epithelium, resembling glandular epithelium. Conclusion: The described entity is likely to be a dysontogenetic orbital cyst. Ethiopathogenesis remains unclear, however tissue derivation of the cyst from the lacrimal drainage system appears plausible.",

A complete ophthalmic examination, including slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, performed by a certified ophthalmologist, revealed that the ocular structures were normal in both eyes. Ocular ultrasound showed variable echogenicity of the enlarged third eyelid gland and no orbital extension of the lesion was detected. Cytological examination of the fine needle aspirate of the mass was not diagnostic. Complete blood work and immunofluorescence for Leishmania infantum and Ehrlichia canis did not reveal any abnormalities. Surgical excision of the mass and the involved third eyelid was performed for diagnostic and curative purposes. The histopathology revealed a pyogranulomatous dacryoadenitis of the gland. Special histochemical staining (PAS, Fite Faraco) failed to reveal specific pathogens. At the follow-up examination (1 year after surgery) STT I was in the normal range. Conclusion: To the authors' knowledge this is the first case of a pyogranulomatous dacryoadenitis involving the third eyelid gland in a dog, and it should be included in the differential diagnoses of third eyelid masses. The etiology is not yet certain, future studies should be performed to better elucidate the etiopathogenesis. space occupying lesion in the left retrobulbar space originating from the zygomatic gland causing moderate exophthalmos, regional bone atrophy and mild lymphadenomegaly. FNAB yielded a viscous gold-yellow fluid with mild purulent infiltrate without any evidence of neoplastic cells. The suspected sialocoele was surgically approached via left modified lateral orbitotomy through the zygomatic arch and the calcified orbital ligament, followed by resection of the zygomatic gland. The cat recovered uneventfully from the surgery and was discharged 2 days post the surgery. The eye remained functional. Histopathology revealed a predominantly solid nodular epithelial proliferation with positive PAS and cytokeratin staining, confirming an adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a feline zygomatic adenocarcinoma resected with a modified lateral orbitotomy. Purpose: To document, through microscopic pictures, histological features and structural postnatal maturation in canine eyes from birth to 2 months of age. Methods: Forty-seven eyes of 47 puppies (9 breeds) were collected after they died naturally. After enucleation, globes were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, sagittally bisected and routinely processed. Four lm sections were stained with Haematoxylin&Eosin, Periodic Acid Schiff and Masson trichrome. Ocular structures were analysed separately with information regarding maturation of each tissue component. Results: At birth, the cornea was thin with high density of keratocytes, the iris was thin with regular posterior surface. Vascular structures, corresponding to the pupillary membrane, were visible on the iris' anterior surface and on the anterior lens capsule. The ciliary body contained small sized eosinophilic muscle fibers. The lens had a regular anterior epithelium and a thin capsule. Only two retinal layers were noticed: single basophilic dense nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer. During the first 2 months, the cornea grew thicker with a stratified squamous epithelium with cell density diminution of endothelium and stroma. The posterior surface of the iris became irregular and the ciliary body contained strong muscle fibers. During that period, cellular migration was observed in lens nuclei and in the retina with differentiation of the layers. Conclusion: This study provides both information and histological illustrations that increase the knowledge of postnatal maturation of puppies' eyes during neonatal and paediatric periods. It highlights the correlation between structural changes and progressive acquisition of functional characteristics especially after the eyelids opened. Purpose: To determine the incidence and describe ocular abnormalities in Polish Hunting Dogs. Methods: The study was performed on 160 Polish Hunting Dogs -82 female and 78 male, aged between 3 months and 12 years. Ophthalmic examinations were performed using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, and tonometry-Tonopen, Tonovet. Photographs of the ocular fundus were taken with a fundus camera (Handy NM 2000, Nidek) connected to a computer. Each dog was examined according to an ophthalmological protocol based on ECVO rules for examination of hereditary eye disease. Results: Distichiasis was diagnosed in 25 dogs (15.6%), cataracts in 5 (3.1%), iris coloboma in 3 (2%), PPMs in 7 (4.4%), and a dermoid in one dog. There were 1 nuclear, 2 mature and 2 cortical cataracts. All PPMs were 'iris to iris' -2 bilateral and 5 unilateral. Retinal degeneration (PRA) was diagnosed in 2 dogs (1.3%). Retinopathies were observed in 15 dogs (9.4%). There were 9 cases of unilateral and 6 cases of bilateral retinopathy. The observed symptoms of retinopathy in Polish Hunting Dogs included: focal areas of tapetal hyperreflectivity, abnormal pigmentation, lesions with indistinct borders and strong pigmentation, patchy increased reflectivity, and focal retinal edema. intraocular lens placement were performed in both eyes. After surgery, refraction was within \u00c00.25 diopters in both eyes. Uveitis was easily controlled and visual rehabilitation was evident on the basis of improved tracking and feeding behavior. Conclusion: Successful phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation for visual rehabilitation in an eagle owl were achieved. The power and size of the intraocular lens, based on measurements obtained and Binkhorst equation, were calculated easily and correctly.",

Methods: A complete ophthalmic examination, including Schirmer-Tear-Test (STT1), applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and binocular indirect ophthlamoscopy after pharmacologic dilatation, was performed in 37 Whippets. Photographs were taken to document the ophthalmic findings in the dogs. Results: Thirty-seven (74 eyes) Whippets (17 intact females, 14 intact males, 3 spayed females and 3 castrated males) with a median age of 3.3 years (range 6 months to 9 years) were included in the study. Mean tear production was 20 mm/min (range 13-24 mm/min) and mean intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg (range 8-24 mmHg). Only mild pectinate ligament variations were found during gonioscopy in 12 eyes (fibrae latae and laminae).

Methods: A 10-yearold female spayed domestic short-haired (DSH) cat was presented with a bleeding mass in the central cornea of the left eye and a history of a perforating ulcer. Cat 2, an 8-year-old male neutered DSH, was presented for left eye opacity involving about 70% of the cornea. In both cases, lamellar keratectomy was performed and corneal specimens were sent for histopathology. Lesion relapse occurred after 3 months in the first cat and 2 years in the second cat: enucleation was performed in both cases. Differential diagnoses for the ocular conditions included: granulation tissue secondary to ocular trauma, stromal keratitis and corneal neoplasia. Results: CBC and blood biochemistry were unremarkable in both cases. Histopathology of keratectomy specimens revealed a corneal hemangiosarcoma in cat 1, and an intense reactive stromal neovascularization with mild keratitis in cat 2. Histopathology of the eye of cat 1 showed iris incarceration within corneal stroma with neoplastic transformation of iris vessels. Lesions were confined to the cornea. In the eye of cat 2, a large corneal hemangiosarcoma with involvement of limbal conjunctiva was detected. Conclusion: Primary corneal hemangiosarcomas have rarely been described in cats. Since the cornea is avascular, previous corneal neovascularization is a sine qua non for corneal hemangiosarcoma. In one of the cases (cat 1) vessels derived from incarcerated iris stroma, which can be considered a very unusual instance, while in the other case (cat 2) vessels were most likely secondary to corneal inflammation. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of platelet-rich (PRP) and platelet-poor (PPP) plasma on PCNA and MMPs expression during repair of deep corneal ulcers. Methods: Forty-five female rabbits were divided into 3 groups (n = 15), referred as GR (PRP), GP (PPP) and GC (controls), in accordance with treatment. All animals underwent surgical induction of unilateral corneal ulcer by vacuum trephine followed by delamination using crescent knife. PRP and PPP eye drops were made by using centrifuged blood using a standardized protocol, and instilled every 5 h. In GC, lubricating eye drops were used. Meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, IM, SID) and morphine (2 mg/kg, IM, QID) were administered to control pain. Each group was subdivided (n = 5), according to the final time point, M4 (4 days), M7 (7 days) and M30 (30 days). The animals' corneas were processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis for PCNA, MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, MT1-MMP and TIMP1. Experimental procedures were approved by Sao Paulo State University ethical committee. Results: At M4, the levels of MMP2 were higher in GP and GR than GC. At M7, this was only observed in GP. At M30, more epithelial cells and MMP1 expression were found in GR than GP. MMP2 expression was higher at M4 than at M30. Conclusion: The use of platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma eye drops influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinases involved in the corneal repair process and most often promotes its increase. PRP stimulates PCNA expression more in the early phase compared to other time points. Support: FAPESP (Process:2011/23107-0) and CNPq.",

Methods: A 2 month-old female tiger cub was presented for evaluation of a cloudy right eye since birth. An ophthalmic examination was performed as a part of physical health check, including; Schirmer tear test (STT), fluorescein dye application, tonometry, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and fundoscopy. Blood samples were collected and submitted for major viral and protozoal infections such as feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpes virus and Toxoplasma gondii antibody titers. Results: Complete blood count and blood chemistry profile results were normal and negative results for virus infections and T. gondii exposure were obtained. Ophthalmic examination findings in the right eye included a cloudy cornea due to iris-to-cornea persistent pupillary membranes, mild mucoid ocular discharge, and mild perilimbal hyperemia. STT and IOP were in the normal range, and all reflexes were normal in both eyes. Clinical improvement was detected at the 2 and 12 month follow-up, respectively. Conclusion: In Thailand, this is the first reported case of persistent pupillary membranes in a tiger. In a tiger cub, the presence of persistent pupillary membranes should be considered as differential diagnosis for a cloudy eye and as a congenital developmental anomaly. Additional investigation of any possible causes such as inheritance, health, or nutrition status should be evaluated for the congenital problem in this certain species.",

Age (3.2 AE 1.7 years with a spread of 0.25-7 years), gender and breed had no statistically significant effect on refractive error (P < 0.05). No statistical significance was noted between the refractive error of the right and left eyes (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The majority of rabbits, regardless of age, tend to be emmetropic; one rabbit was myopic and seven were hyperopic. There was no significant difference in refractive error between right and left eyes. Age, gender and breed had no effect on refractive error (P < 0.05 Purpose: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease in animals and humans. Different possible pathogenic factors were described, including the involvement of the immune system. Previously, immunization of rats with glaucoma-related antigens induced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. The purpose of this study was to investigate alterations in retinal cells after immunization with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or GDNF plus heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Methods: Rats were immunized with GDNF and GDNF+HSP27. After 4 weeks retinas were stained with Brn-3a and NeuN to quantify RGC density and with GFAP and vimentin to investigate macroglia. Amacrine cells were labelled with parvalbumin, and photoreceptors with rhodopsin and opsin. Animals were handled according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Results: Retinas of immunized animals showed a significant loss of either Brn-3a + RGCs (GDNF: P = 0.025; GDNF+HSP27: P = 0.04) or NeuN + RGCs (GDNF: P = 0.037; GDNF+HSP27: P = 0.005). In the GDNF group the GFAP + /vimentin + area was significantly increased (GFAP: P = 0.00005; vimentin: P = 0.007), but no changes could be observed in the GDNF+HSP27 group. A loss of amacrine cells was detected in the GDNF+HSP27 group (P < 0.05). Photoreceptors were not affected. Conclusion: Immunization led to a significant RGC loss. In the GDNF group, an activation of macroglia, but no further damage of retinal cells was observed. In the GDNF+HSP27 group, we detected no macroglia activation but a loss of amacrine cells. We propose that an inhibition of glia cell activity occurs after GDNF+HSP27 immunization. Therefore, the inner nuclear layer is more affected. Purpose: To measure normal globe size in the dog, to make breed comparisons and to establish a reference range in some breeds. Methods: An extensive archive of skull scans obtained by computed tomography (CT) was reviewed for efficient retrospective data acquisition. Only adult purebred dogs with non-ocular and non-orbital disease were included. The globe length, width and height were measured in three planes. Ten different breeds were evaluated with a minimum of eight dogs per breed (n = 94). A subset of 10 dogs was measured twice to assess reproducibility. Results: Breeds were grouped as large, medium and small. All measurements were reproducible (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.56-0.89). Globes of large breeds (mean weight 35.6 kg) were significantly longer ( Purpose: To describe fourteen cats that developed conjunctival mastocytosis characterized by papillary epithelial proliferation and reactive mast cells within the epithelium.

Ocular specimens were stained with hematoxylin-and-eosin and Giemsa or Toluidine Blue. Results: Fourteen cats underwent excisional biopsy. Median age was 8 years (range 0.7-17) and sex or breed predilection were not noted. The nictitating membrane was affected in 10/14 cases. The median duration of a mass prior to excision was 4 months (range 0.7-17). Lesions were unilateral in 11/14 cats, 6/ 14 cats had coexisting corneal disease, and two cats had eosinophilic keratitis. Various topical and oral medications were administered before and following excision, including antibiotics, steroids, immune-modulators, NSAIDs, anti-virals, anti-histamines and l-lysine. Recurrence was documented in one case; tacrolimus 0.02% was applied and the mass lesions regressed. Clinically and histologically, proliferative conjunctival masses were noted in all but one case. Lesions were histologically characterized by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with an abundance of mast cells, marked edema, and papillary epithelial hyperplasia with the presence of intraepithelial mast cells. Finding mast cells within the epithelium is an unusual phenomenon which is critical in making the diagnosis of papillary mastocytosis. Mast cells were confirmed with Giemsa or Toluidine Blue. Conclusion: Feline papillary mastocytosis is an uncommon non-neoplastic condition affecting the conjunctiva in cats. Etiology remains unknown, but a hypersensitivity reaction or feline herpesvirus-1 involvement is suspected.",

A brown-pigmented area was present on the conjunctiva of the leading edge of the third eyelid. The indolent ulcer transformed into a superficial sequestrum within 10 days of initial presentation. Surgical removal of the pigmented lesion was performed. The corneal sequestrum was initially treated with a bandage contact lens (BCL). Five weeks after the first BCL placement, surgery to perform a corneo-conjunctival transposition was undertaken due to failure of the sequestrum to clear.

Purpose: To evaluate safety, tolerance and potential extraocular migration of intravitreally injected mesenchymal stem cells in pigmented rabbit eyes, by ophthalmic follow-up and histological evaluation. Methods: The use of animals in this study was in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Mesenchymal stem cells used in this study (MSV; Citospin SL, Valladolid, Spain) are approved for clinical used by the Spanish Drug Agency. Twenty-four rabbits (Rex Chinchilla-NZW) were randomized into six groups of 4 animals. Groups 1 and 4 received an intravitreal injection into the right eye of 1.5 9 10 6 MSV, in 0.05 mL vehicle (Ringer-Lactato-based). Groups 2 and 5 received a similar injection of 0.75 9 10 6 MSV. In Groups 3 and 6 (controls) only the vehicle was injected. Evaluation of anterior segment by slit-lamp, posterior segment by indirect ophthalmoscopy, and intraocular pressure by Tonopen \u00e2 was performed. Clinical signs were evaluated before MSV injection and weekly during 6 weeks. Clinical signs were graded and scored by the Hackett&McDonald method. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 6 weeks, and the eyes, liver, spleen and gonads processed for HE staining and histological evaluation. Results: Ophthalmic follow-up did not reveal clinical differences between control and MSV-injected groups at any time point evaluated. No pathological findings related to ocular, liver, spleen and/or gonads were observed in any group. Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSV) are safe and well tolerated after intravitreal injection in pigmented rabbit eyes. This study reinforces the potential of cell therapy for eye diseases.

Methods: A 6month-old, male Bengal cat was presented because of changes of the left eye. Ophthalmic and general physical examinations were performed. Ancillary diagnostic procedures included biopsy of the conjunctival mass, radiographic and echographic examination of the thorax and complete blood count. The conjunctival mass was dissected from the surrounding tissue and excised, leaving the bulbus and eyelid intact. The removed tissue was submitted for histopathology. Results: Ophthalmic examination of the left eye revealed enophthalmos, a conjunctival mass protruding into the palpebral fissure and a partial bullous retinal detachment dorsally. Conjunctival biopsy revealed a severe chronic suppurative inflammation. During general physical examination a deformation of the sternum and a displaced heart beat were noted. A pectus excavatum was seen on chest radiographs. Other than a displacement of the heart to the left, ultrasound examination was unremarkable. Further diagnostics and a barrier retinopexy were declined by the owner. After lesion excision, histopathologic examination of the mass yielded a lacrimal gland ductal cyst with pyogranulomatous inflammation. Follow-up revealed a good functional result and no recurrence after 6 months after cyst removal.

Methods: Ten healthy Australian Shepherd dogs (five females and five males) aged from 2 to 7 years were included in this study. These dogs were from the 'Australian Shepherd Wind Spirit Kennel' (S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and all procedures were conducted with the consent of the owners. The eye blink rate (EBR) was obtained from digital video imaging of each dog's eyes captured during 3 min and represented a counting of the eyelid movements (complete and incomplete blinks). Tear production was measured with the Schirmer tear test 1 (STT1). The central corneal sensitivity was determined by evaluating the corneal touch threshold (CTT) with the Cochet-Bonnet aestesiometer. The tests were performed in both eyes without instillation of anesthetic eye drops. The right eye was the first eye tested. Results: There were no significant differences between the left and right eyes (P \u2264 0.05), except in the STT (P = 0.0028). The mean value of the EBR was 10.7 blinks/min (2.4 complete blinks and 8.3 incomplete blinks). The STT mean values were 31 AE 4.9 mm/min (left eye) and 27.8 AE 4.5 mm/min (right eye). The mean CTT was 2.6 AE 0.5 cm. Conclusion: The procedures were easy to perform and reliable to measure the chosen parameters.

Methods: One hundred dogs of various breeds and both sexes were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: presence of a severe systemic disease, no anesthesiological procedures within the previous 24 h, and no therapy with drugs that could interfere with TP. Another inclusion criterium was the absence of any ocular abnormalities assessed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and applanation tonometry preceded by the Schirmer Tear Test type I in both eyes. For each dog the illness severity was calculated by a diagnosis independent score (Severity Prediction Index -SPI-2) which predicts probability of survival based on variation of 7 clinical parameters within 24 h of admission. Data were statistically analyzed and the Spearmann test was used to detect a possible correlation between SPI-2 score and TP. Results: In the 53 male and 47 female dogs no statistical difference in TP was found between left and right eyes. No significant effect of both, age and body weight on TP was detected. A difference related to gender was found, with intact male dogs showing a lower TP. The variables SPI-2 and TP in the critically ill dogs were correlated (P < 0.0001) and a positive correlation was detected (rs 0.957).

Purpose: To monitor histologic changes in the equine cornea at different times after CXL. Methods: Four equine corneas (3 horses) were treated with CXL according to a modified Dresden-protocol. Epithelial debridement of a circular area (8 mm in diameter) outlined by a biopsy punch was performed using a scalpel blade and was followed by installation of riboflavin eye drops for 30 min. The area was illuminated with UV-A 3 mW/cm 2 during 30 min. The corneas were harvested under general anesthesia at different time points after CXL; 16 h, 24 h, 20 day and 31 day and then fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde. Light-microscopy (LM) (hematoxylin eosin and picrosirius red-polarized staining) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on each specimen. Results: All corneas showed similar types of changes. LM showed keratocytes with cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear fragmentation in treated areas. Picrosirius red-polarized sections revealed loss of normal lamellar architecture of the corneal stroma. TEM showed multiple apoptotic keratocytes characterized by cytoplasmic and nuclear blebbing and degenerated keratocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm. The superficial stroma presented disorganized extracellular matrix with disorganized collagen fibers and deposition of tangles of elastic fibers. Degeneration of keratocytes and apoptosis was seen as deep as 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the stromal surface. No inflammatory reaction was seen. Conclusion: LM and TEM showed loss of normal lamellar structure and characteristic signs of apoptosis and degeneration of keratocytes in CXL treated areas in all eyes. We believe these changes are associated with the UV treatment. Support: Peschke Meditrade GmbH is acknowledged for providing equipment for CXL for the study.",

            "text": "Purpose: Prostaglandin analogues contribute to blood aqueous barrier breakdown, and may exacerbate uveitis. Therefore, we hypothesized that their therapeutic, hypotensive effect may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory treatment. Our aim was to determine whether topical 1% prednisolone acetate alters the effects of 0.005% latanoprost on pupil diameter (PD) and intraocular pressure (IOP) in normal dogs. Methods: IOP and PD were measured hourly, 8 AM-4 PM, using a TonoPen XL and a Vernier caliper, respectively. The right and left eyes served as control (CE) and treated (TE) eye, respectively. Measurements were conducted in Labrador retrievers during four sessions with 1-week washouts in between: (1) Without treatment (n = 10), (2) Following latanoprost treatment (n = 10) at 8AM (3) Following prednisolone treatment (n = 7) at 8AM (4) Bilateral latanoprost treatment at 8AM, with prednisolone applied in TE at 11AM (n = 8). Results: At 11AM, latanoprost significantly decreased PD (mean AE SD) in CE and TE from 5.76 AE 0.49 mm and 5.85 AE 0.72 mm to 1.93 AE 0.32 mm and 1.82 AE 0.50 mm, respectively (P = 0.012, Wilcoxon test). PDs were not affected by the addition of prednisolone, and at 4PM were 3.82 AE 0.47 and 3.97 AE 0.36 mm in TE and CE, respectively (P = 0.175, Wilcoxon test). At 11AM, latanoprost significantly decreased IOP in CE and TE from 10.0 AE 1.4 mmHg and 10.5 AE 1.8 mmHg to 7.8 AE 1.2 mmHg and 8.0 AE 1.5 mmHg, respectively (P = 0.012, Wilcoxon test). IOP was not affected by the addition of prednisolone, and at 4PM was 9.0 AE 0.8 and 9.3 AE 0.8 mmHg in TE and CE, respectively (P = 0.339, Wilcoxon test). Conclusion: Prednisolone did not alter the miotic and hypotensive effects of latanoprost in normal dogs.",

Methods: A diagnostic ultrasound system (ProSound a7, Hitachi Aloka Medical, LTD.) and 10-MHz linear probe were used to image 80 eyes in 40 dogs. A standoff fixture was constructed at the top of the probe using ultrasonic gel and a semi-permeable dressing film. Horizontal and vertical sections through the optic disc were imaged after instilling ophthalmic hydroxyethyl cellulose solution under topical anesthesia. The corneal and posterior scleral lines and axial distances were measured using ImageJ software (NIH). The corneal and posterior scleral CRs were calculated using the generalized gradient reduction method of solver function with spreadsheet software (Excel, Microsoft Corp.) . Results: The 80 eyes included 23 normal eyes, 20 eyes with cataracts, 27 eyes with an intraocular lens (IOL), five with phthisis bulbi, three with glaucoma, one with nodular episcleritis, and one with retinal detachment. The mean corneal CR of normal eyes, eyes with cataracts and eyes with IOLs was 6.8 AE 1.00, 6.7 AE 1.00 and 6.8 AE 1.01 mm, respectively. The corneal and posterior scleral CRs were less than one-half of the total ocular axis length. Conclusion: This novel standoff technique for ocular ultrasonography may be useful in determining the corneal and posterior scleral curvature radius.",

Methods: Corneal limbal epithelial cells (n = 8) were expanded on dAM monolayer for 14 days. An explant culture technique was used. Cell migration and growth were evaluated daily by phase contrast microscopy. Histological examination was performed following hematoxylin and eosin staining. Antibodies against the cytokeratin pair 3/12 and p63 were used to detect corneal differentiated and progenitor cells, respectively.

Rabbit limbal explants (n = 20) were cultured on human iAM or dAM for 14 days. Non-cultured limbal tissues were used as control. All material was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 8 lm. The LEPCs were immunolocated with anti-p63 antibody (clone 4A4). The Feulgen reaction was used to detect DNA. The samples were evaluated under an optical microscope coupled with software for image analysis (Image J \u00e2 , NIH). Optical density (OD) and integrated optical density (IOD) were quantified. Data were evaluated by uni-and multivariate statistical analyses. Results: LEPCs grown on iAM and dAM showed reduced OD values (0.51 AE 0.02 and 0.52 AE 0.03, respectively) compared with controls (0.59 AE 0.00; P < 0.05). No difference in IOD was observed between the LEPCs grown on iAM (16.93 AE 2.86) and controls (18.93 AE 5.92; P = 0.42). LEPCs grown on dAM showed reduced IOD values (14.62 AE 1.02; P = 0.00) compared with controls. The levels of similarity between LEPCs grown on iAM or dAM and controls were 50.03% and 49.92%, respectively. Conclusion: LEPCs cultured ex vivo have less condensed chromatin-DNA structure, which is more active transcriptionally than non-cultured limbal tissues, regardless whether they grew on iAM or dAM.

Methods: A 4-month-old Hungarian sporthorse colt was presented to the Equine Clinic with a history of bilateral abundant mucopurulent discharge and mild blepharospasm. Results: Clinical parameters were within normal range. Direct PLRs, dazzle, corneal and palpebral reflexes, and menace responses were normal. On ophthalmic examination, ventrotemporally located dermoids on both corneas, a cluster of aberrant long hairs protruding from both carunculas and medial canthi OU and duplicated inferior eyelid OS (with double eyelid margins and conjunctival fornices) were identified. The dermoids covered one third of the corneas and also involved the juxtapose conjunctiva. The corneal margins of the dermoids were heavily pigmented. Fluorescein dye revealed no stain uptake. IOP was 20 mmHg OD and 24 mmHg OS. The posterior segment was normal in both eyes. Bilateral superficial keratectomy, conjunctivectomy and conjunctival covering of the sclera were performed to excise dermoids under general anesthesia. Hairy skin was cut out from the medial canthi and blepharoplasty was performed. Histopathology identified the haired tissue as corneal dermoids. Postoperative treatment was carried out with SPL tubes. Excision appeared curative at 6 months post-operative follow-up, as clear corneas, no discharge and good eyelid function remained. Conclusion: Dermoids in horses are rare. Only three reports have described respectively limbal dermoids with aniridia in quarterhorses, a case of a bilateral ocular dermoid and a third eyelid dermoid. Bilateral dermoids in the ventro-temporal cornea with palpebral malformation have not been described so far.",

Methods: An algorithm designed for human fundus images (Junction Markup \u00e2 ) was applied to feline images obtained with a fundus camera to compare retinal vasculature parameters in healthy cats (n = 37), cats with hyperthyroidism (6), DM (5) and CKD (7). Vascular junction geometry parameters included diameters of parent vessel (d0), child one (d1) and child two (d2), angle of bifurcation (h), branching angle of child one (h1) and child two (h2), bifurcation index, asymmetric ratio, first and second diameter ratios, width and area ratio, junction exponent, optimality parameter, arteriole-to-venule ratio, diameter of parent vessels of arterial and venous junctions.

Methods: Three cases of severe enophthalmos with secondary entropion and concurrent trichiasis caused by hyperthyroidism, aging and phthisis bulbi, respectively, and one case of iatrogenic trichiasis following eyelid surgery. All patients showed severe discomfort, intense epiphora, blepharospasm and lacked the requirements for a safe general anesthesia either because of medical conditions or because it was declined by the owners. Prior to the procedure possible allergic reactions were tested by intradermal injection of the compound in the neck region. Sedation was performed by administration of Butorphanol (0.3 mg/kg, IV) and was followed by topical application of a Lidocaine 2.5% + Prilocaine 2.5% creme. Different amounts (from 0.2 mL to 0.6 mL) of HA for each eye were then injected 2-2.5 mm from and parallel to the margin of the lid until normal posi-tioning of the eyelid hairs was restored. Patients were discharged the same day and treated with topical Tobramycin for 15 days. Results: Neither local nor systemic complications were observed in the early postoperative period and all patients showed complete remission of discomfort, epiphora and blepharospasm. Two weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 4 months follow ups showed no recurrence of trichiasis. Conclusion: Intradermal injection of HA could represent a valid alternative to surgical resolution of trichiasis, especially for patients in whom general anesthesia is not recommended. ",

Methods: A 7-year-old female intact Longhaired Dachshund was presented with a 1 week history of vomiting and seizures with intense facial rubbing. A decreased total serum calcium and a decreased plasma parathyroid hormone confirmed the diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism. The patient was treated with oral calcium carbonate. During a follow-up period of 65 months the dog remained clinically normal and visual with calcium levels in the low to low normal range. The patient was euthanized for unrelated reasons and both eyes were enucleated. Results: Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral symmetrical multifocal punctate opacities in the anterior and posterior subcapsular and cortical regions of the lens that formed coalescing lamellar opacities 2 years after the initial diagnosis. Histopathology revealed bilateral minimal anterior uveitis, a discontinuous, heavily pigmented preiridal fibrovascular membrane, cortical cataract with thinning of the lens cortex and, in the more severely affected right eye only, anterior subcapsular cataract, thinning of the outer plexiform layer of the retina dorsal to the optic nerve, and focal minor gliosis at the optic nerve head. Conclusion: Primary hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon disease in dogs, and histopathological descriptions of ocular changes are rare. The characteristic bilateral cataracts are the most frequently reported clinical ocular sign. Histopathology of the eyes following euthanasia 5 years after diagnosis describes the cataracts and shows other ocular changes, of uncertain significance, in association with hypoparathyroidism in this case.",

            "text": "The prevalence of ocular lesions in cats with diabetes mellituspreliminary data N Peche, C Weingart, B Kohn and JC Eule Small Animal Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universit\u20ac at, Berlin, Germany Purpose: Diabetes mellitus (D.m.) is one of the most important feline endocrinopathies (1 in 400 cats). It is known to cause ocular changes in various species, among which osmotic cataracts and retinopathies are most common. Cats are reported to be almost resistant to diabetic cataract formation and only few case reports of feline diabetic retinopathy are published. Comprehensive ophthalmic data of a representative number of diseased cats are lacking. Therefore the aim of the study was to examine diabetic cats for ocular changes. Methods: In this prospective study cats with D.m. underwent a complete ophthalmic examination. Patients' signalment, laboratory test results and the time since diabetes was diagnosed were considered. Results: Fifteen cats (12 male, 3 female) with a mean age of 11.3 AE 2.6 years and a mean body weight of 5.6 AE 1.1 kg were enrolled. Duration of diabetes ranged from 0 to 53 months. All cats were visual, had normal intraocular pressure and Schirmer tear test-values. Thirty eyes of 15 cats (100%) showed nuclear sclerosis. Ten of 30 eyes (33.3%) and 6/30 eyes (20%) showed incipient cortical or minor immature cortical cataracts, respectively. Two cats had a corneal erosion. Ophthalmoscopy always revealed a normal fundus appearance. Conclusion: All diabetic cats showed some kind of ocular alterations among which lens changes were most commonly seen. According to the description of lenticular changes in elderly cats (Williams and Heath, VO 2006) these minor changes were assumed to be age-related. Osmotic cataracts or signs of diabetic retinopathy were not found. Purpose: To investigate changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) during exercise in dogs. Methods: Fifteen healthy dogs of different breeds, with an average age of 2.9 years and an average body weight of 14.14 kg, underwent an exercise test on a motorized treadmill (professional canine treadmill, \u00e2 Grillo, Modena, Italy) at the following speeds: 2.5 km/h for 15 min, 5.0 km/h for 20 min and 2.5 km/h for 10 min. IOP was measured with a Tonopen Vet (Medtronic, Solan-USA) at rest (T0), immediately after exercise (T1) and 1 h later (T2). IOP data are presented as the mean AE SEM. Student's t-test was used to calculate significance between means before the exercise, immediately after the exercise and 1 h after the conclusion of the exercise. P < 0.05 was significant. Results: At rest (T0) the mean IOP was 12.86 mmHg in the right eye (OD) and 13.57 mmHg in the left eye (OS). Immediately after exercise (T1) the mean IOP was 12.64 mmHg in OD and 11.71 mmHg in OS. After the exercise was finished (T2) the values were 11.71 mmHg (OD) and 11.43 mmHg (OS). These changes in IOP were not significant immediately at the end of the exercise (P > 0.05), but they were significant 1 h later (P = 0.023 OD; P = 0.0088 OS). Conclusion: This study demonstrates, in a population of young adult dogs, that a period of dynamic exercise leads to significant changes in IOP. June 2012 to November 2014 were swabbed for bacterial culture and sensitivity. Before sampling, the presence of corneal ulceration was confirmed with fluorescein staining. Only patients with no previous treatment with antibiotics were included in the study. Bacterial isolates were identified and the antibiotic susceptibility was tested to neomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Results: In total, 99 species of bacteria were isolated from 92 eyes. Staphylococcus sp. were the most commonly isolated (46.47%), followed by Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. (13.13%), Enterobacter sp. (8.08%), Streptococcus sp. (7.07%) and Escherichia coli (6.06%). All species isolated in this study were most sensitive to ofloxacin (84.44%), followed by gentamicin (72.46%) and tobramycin (72.06%). Ofloxacin was significantly more efficient than neomycin, polymyxin B, and moxifloxacin (P < 0.0001), chloramphenicol (P = 0.0002), ciprofloxacin (P = 0.005), and tobramycin (P = 0.018); but did not differ significantly when compared to gentamicin (P = 0.86 Purpose: To evaluate the effect of deep sclerectomy (DS) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs with experimentally induced ocular hypertension. Methods: Under general anesthesia, DS was performed on the right eye (DS-group) of 9 clinically normal beagle dogs. After the sclera was exposed, a one-third thickness limbal based superficial 5 9 5 mm scleral flap was dissected. A deep 4 9 4 mm scleral flap was dissected leaving a thin layer of deep sclera over the choroid. Once the aqueous humor percolated through the tissue, the flap was repositioned and sutured with 10-0 nylon. The left eye of each dog was included as control. Postoperative complications and IOPs were evaluated after surgery. Ten days after surgery, both eyes were infused with balanced salt solution (5 lL/min for 60 min) to induce ocular hypertension. The IOP values of both eyes were measured by rebound tonometry every 5 min for 1 h. Results: Postoperative complications were mainly mild conjunctival hyperemia and subconjunctival hemorrhage and disappeared in 3 days with topical steroid-antibiotic suspension. Postoperative IOP of the DS-group was not significantly different from control and preoperative IOP, respectively. While inducing ocular hypertension, the IOP of the DSgroup was significantly lower than that of the control (P < 0.01). Sixty minutes after infusion, the IOP values of DS-group and control were 45.3 AE 7.3 (mean AE S.D.) and 76.6 AE 9.2 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The DS had IOP-lowering effect on experimentally induced ocular hypertension with few immediate postoperative complications.",

Methods: A 9.5-year-old, female spayed Small Munsterlander (body weight 14 kg) was presented with a facial deformity that was limited to the left frontal sinus region. The biopsy results of the mass indicated FS-SCC. The tumor was resected radically by using a dorsal approach for medial superior orbitectomy. Skin and subcutaneous muscle were cut sharply. An oscillating saw was used to remove the involved part of the frontal bone and the medial orbit. Care was taken to leave the left eye, optic nerve and extraocular muscles untouched. After removal of the os frontale and the overlying tissue the left frontal sinus was opened. The medial part of the orbit and major part of the dorsal eyelid were resected as well. For closing of the sinus and medial stabilizing of the eyeball four layers of an artificial Polyglactine mesh (Vicryl \u00e2 ; Ethicon Johnson-Johnson, Norderstedt, Germany) were sutured in the defect. Subsequently the skin of the dorsal eyelid was reconstructed using T-plasty. Postoperative treatments included Elizabethan collar, systemic analgesia and antibiotics and topical oxytetracyclin ointment. Results: The tumour was completely resected. Five months postoperatively the cosmetic result was good and the eye was visual. Conclusions: FS-SCC is a rare tumor in humans and dogs. It can be treated with vision-sparing partial (superior) orbitectomy in dogs.",

Ultrasound demonstrated a thin-walled, cavitary hypoechoic lesion lateral to the right orbit consistent with a cyst or an abscess. Cytologic examination of the dark redbrown aspirated fluid revealed the presence of numerous inflammatory cells without the presence of infectious organisms. Further work-up was declined by the owner. The horse was reevaluated 2 months later because of recurrence and worsening of the swelling associated with mild exophthalmos. Results: Computed tomography of the skull revealed a spaceoccupying mass originating from the right frontal bone zygomatic process, extending through the temporal bone zygomatic process ventral to the globe in the zygomatic bone, and expanding within the right maxillary sinus. Severe expansile lysis of the zygomatic arch was observed and mild exophthalmos was confirmed. Total cyst excision was performed leaving deliberately a communication with the right maxillary sinus. Histological examination revealed a cyst lined with non-respiratory epithelium in contrary to previously reported cases. Recovery was uneventful. No recurrence was observed within a 5-month follow-up period. A marked depression persisted temporal to the globe. The etiology of this cyst remains inconclusive. Conclusion: We report the successful surgical cure of an epithelial inclusion cyst of the zygomatic arch in a horse which origin differs from previously reported frontal bone cysts.",

Methods: One mg of atropine sulphate was administered intravenously and topically to one healthy Swedish warmblooded trotter with a washout period of 1 week in between treatments. Jugular blood samples were taken 15 times in 8 h after treatment. Plasma concentrations of atropine were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with a detection limit for atropine in plasma of 0.13 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. A clinical examination was performed every 3 h and the horse was continuously monitored for signs of colic. Results: The plasma concentration of atropine 10 min after intravenous injection was 3.71 ng/mL. The terminal half-life was determined to be 109 min and plasma levels of atropine were below detection limit 6 h after intravenous treatment. The plasma concentration 10 min after topical administration was 0.66 ng/mL. The terminal half-life was determined to be 61 min and plasma levels of atropine were below detection limit 5 h after topical treatment. No colic signs were observed during the study in any of the treatments. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that the terminal half-life of atropine in plasma is approximately 1 h in the horse after topical administration. Further studies are needed to confirm the results and to draw conclusions regarding the clinical significance of the results, including the potential systemic effects of different treatment regimes.",

Portable, mini-Ganzfeld ERG and Welch Allyn hand-held autorefractor were used to test retinal response and refractive error in the dogs at baseline and at the end of the supplementation period. Results: All ERG a-wave amplitudes obtained were increased in the treatment group compared to those of dogs in the control group, with significant improvements in the scotopic high and photopic single flash cone (P < 0.05 for both) ERG responses. For the bwave amplitudes all responses were increased similarly, with significant improvements in responses for the scotopic high light intensity stimulation (P < 0.05), and for photopic single flash cone and 30 Hz flicker (P < 0.01 for both) recordings. Change in refractive error was significantly less in the treatment group comparing to that of the control group during the six-month study (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared to the control group, antioxidant supplemented group showed improvement to varying degrees for retinal function and significant less decline in the refractive error. Dogs, like humans, experience retinal and lens functional decline with age. Antioxidant supplementation as demonstrated can be beneficial and effective in the long-term preservation and improvement of various functions of the canine eye. The study was performed to characterize the ocular lesions in cats with feline infectious peritonitis using histological and immunohistochemical methods. Methods: Eyes from fifteen cats of different breeds, naturally infected with FCoV (feline coronavirus), were taken for histological and immunohistochemical studies. Before euthanasia ocular examination was performed. The eyes were fixed in formalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. For histopathological studies, 5-lm-thick sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin or methyl-green-pyronin for plasma cell identification. Immunohistochemical examination was performed using anti-coronavirus, anti-CD3, anti-CD79 and anti-macrophage antibodies (MAC 387). Results: Lesions were found in the iris, cilliary body, choroid, retina, optic nerve, cornea, sclera and conjunctiva, which were infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells and less commonly macrophages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that among lymphocytes CD79-positive B cells were much more numerous than CD-3 positive T cells. CD3-immunoreactive cells were present within damaged cilliary processes, iris and around scleral blood vessels. Macrophages were detected between scleral and corneal collagen fibers, and in conjunctiva, choroid, retina and cilliary body. A positive reaction for FCoV was observed in macrophages present within inflammatory exudates in the posterior chamber. Conclusion:",

Methods: Nine eyes from eight client-owned dogs with SCCEDs underwent superficial keratectomy (SK). The ulcerated area was divided into four quadrants with restricted depth knife. Two of four quadrants underwent DBD for 40-60 s. A SK followed. One burred and one non-burred section were fixed with formaldehyde 10% and underwent light microscopy (LM). The remaining quadrants were fixed with glutaraldehyde 2.5% and underwent transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pathologists were masked to the samples. Student's paired t-tests were used to analyse the data. This study was approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics Committee. Results: With LM all non-burred samples had a superficial stromal hyaline acellular zone (HAZ), seven of the burred samples had an intermittent HAZ and in two burred samples this zone was absent. The HAZ thickness of burred samples (1.062 AE 0.664 lm) was significantly thinner than that of the non-burred samples (4.309 AE 1.348 lm) (P < 0.0001). TEM showed an absence of basement membrane and the presence of an amorphous, fine fibrillar material in the superficial stroma in non-burred samples. This material was intermittent or absent in burred samples. Conclusion: DBD significantly reduces the superficial stromal HAZ in SCCEDs, which is believed to interfere with the healing of these defects. Support: Alger Company provided financial support in the form of a grant to fund the evaluation of histopathology samples.",

Methods: Corneas were resected from globes within 1 h post mortem and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Frozen sections and wholemounts were prepared and immunolabeled with anti-b tubulin and anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Binding of antibodies was evaluated using widefield fluorescence microscopy. Series of optical sections were stacked to construct 3D images of corneal innervation patterns. Results: Nerve fibers and fiber bundles presented as b tubulin-immunoreactive in three major corneal layers: corneal stromal nerves, a subepithelial nerve plexus and a subbasal nerve plexus giving rise to a rich network of epithelial nerve terminals. The largest stromal nerves were more abundant in the anterior stroma. TH-immunoreactive fibers were found in the subepithelial stroma in medium-sized bundles but absent in the corneal epithelium. Conclusion: The results demonstrate for the first time the normal innervation pattern in the equine cornea using immunofluorescent labeling. The architectural features of horse corneal innervation closely resemble those reported for other mammals. The results of this study will serve as baseline data for assessing changes in corneal innervation in cases of equine corneal disease.",

Methods: Fifty-two healthy guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) with normal ophthalmic examination were included in the study (104 eyes). Animals were divided into 2 groups according to age: young (4 weeks-old, 29 animals) and adult (3-36 months, 23 animals). Twenty-two were males and 30 females. Both tonometries were performed bilaterally (OU) on the central cornea in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Only means with low standard deviation (SD = 5%) were included. Rebound tonometry was performed first; afterwards a drop of topical anesthetic was applied OU and applanation tonometry was performed. Time taken to get an IOP value was recorded for each eye. Results: Mean IOP readings were as follows: 13.20 AE 1.28 mmHg (adults with TonoVet \u00e2 ) 10.93 AE 3.61 mmHg (adults with TonoPen \u00e2 ) and 8.53 AE 1.28 mmHg (young with TonoVet \u00e2 ). TonoPen \u00e2 readings could not be obtained in young animals. Significant differences were observed between both tonometers in adults (P < 0.05), and between ages with the TonoVet \u00e2 (P < 0.0001). No differences were seen between left and right eyes (P > 0.05), nor between genders (P > 0.05). TonoVet \u00e2 readings were obtained faster than the TonoPen \u00e2 ones (<1 min vs 3.38 AE 1.27 min, respectively (P < 0.0001)). Conclusion: This study establishes normal rebound tonometry values for young and adult Guinea Pigs, and demonstrates that TonoVet \u00e2 tonometry is a rapid and well-tolerated procedure feasible in Guinea Pigs at any age. TonoVet \u00e2 significantly overestimates TonoPen \u00e2 IOP values in adult Guinea Pigs.",

Methods: Twenty-two adult pig eyes were obtained at a local slaughterhouse, anterior segment examination was carried out and DSEK was performed as previously described. Surgeries were recorded, and the execution of the surgery was evaluated. Peeled corneal tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Thickness of the stromal remnants was measured and quantified, and the Descemet membrane (DM) and endothelium were assessed. Results: All DSEK procedures were performed in <10 min. DM was peeled away with no incidences in 18 eyes (82%). In 4 eyes (18%) DM was firmly attached to the overlying stroma, hindering the stripping and inducing peeling away of the DM in fragments. Scant stromal remnants were present in all the DSEK samples, ranging in thickness from 11.86 to 279.76 lm (mean 88.1 lm). While sparse endothelium remnants were only seen in 5/22 eyes (22%), DM was observed in all the samples (22/22;100%). Mild stromal edema was seen in all the samples thicker than 16 lm. Conclusion: DSEK is a technically demanding surgical technique feasible in pig eyes. The amount of stromal remnants obtained in this study was similar to the ones described in human ophthalmology. The pig model can be used for surgical training in DSEK, thereby reducing the incidence of several potential complications associated to the significant learning curve of this technique.",

The objective of this study is to show i-wave and PhNR values in healthy G\u20ac ottingen Minipigs. Methods: Five months old G\u20ac ottingen Minipigs (2 males and 3 females), were included in this study. The study was carried out according to the ARVO resolution. Ophthalmic exam included slit lamp biomicroscopy, direct/indirect ophthalmoscopy and tonometry. The electroretinographic study was performed by a Electrorretinograph Roland Consult with RETIport 4.5.7 software and five electrodes.Full ERG-Flash was obtain based on ECVO and ISCEV 2004. Mydriasis was achieved by topical tropicamide and cyclopentolate. Anesthesia was induced by Zoletil \u00e2 8 mg/Kg and Domtor \u00e2 300 mg/kg IM. Peak time and amplitude values of the PhNR and iwave were obtained manually. Data were statistically processed by IBM-SPSS 21. Results: Iwave is a positive voltage and PhNR is a negative voltage following the b-wave. The Pearson 0 s correlation coefficients between OS/OD were: PhNR peak time 0.916 and amplitude 0.953; i-wave peak time 0.927 and amplitude 0.959. High correlations meant no differences between OS/OD. PhNR media (AESD) were: 50.44 ms (AE5.58) Peak time and 23.09 lV (AE8.9) Amplitude. I-wave media (AESD) were: 59.49 ms (AE3.85) Peak time and 12.31 lV (AE5.16) Amplitude. Conclusion: In the present study, we can identify PhNR and i-wave and measure their values in healthy G\u20ac ottingen Minipig.

Methods: Complete ophthalmic examination, corneal cytology, bacterial/fungal cultures, and histologic examination of both eyes were performed. Results: A 3 month-old female alpaca was presented for delayed growth and a 2-week history of dysorexia. Based on clinical abnormalities, a systemic viral infection was primarily considered but all testing had negative results. Bilateral extensive corneal ulcerations were observed 3 days after admission without history of ocular trauma. The alpaca was treated topically with a fortified solution of gentamicin and orally with meloxicam. Three days later, marked diffuse corneal edema with 8 mm-large bullae, involving the anterior half of the corneal stroma, was observed bilaterally. Fluorescein staining of the bullae was positive. The anterior segment was difficult to assess but mild hypopyon was present in the left eye. Heterologous serum and 0.1% dimeticone were added to the topical treatments. A mild regression of the corneal edema was observed but the stromal No evidence of systemic disease was found at necropsy.

Methods: A search for ophthalmoplegia/ophthalmoparesis was performed in the clinical database. Information collected included age, gender, breed, clinical signs, MRI findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, treatment and follow-up. Cases with ophthalmoplegia/ ophthalmoparesis (internal, external or both) as sole neuro-ophthalmologic sign, head MRI, and minimum 6-month follow up were included. Dogs with progressive neurological signs were excluded. Results: Twelve cases were included. The mean age (standard deviation, SD) was 6 (2.29) years old. The duration of the clinical signs varied from 1 day to 2 years (mean 3.23 months, median 10 days). Cases presented with both internal and external ophthalmoplegia/ophthalmoparesis (9/12) or only internal ophthalmoplegia (3/12). MRI revealed the presence of subtle to marked enhancement of the oculomotor nerve in nine cases. MRI was unremarkable in three cases. CSF was available in 11/12 cases. The cell count mean (SD) was 1.26 (1.96) cells/ul and protein count mean (SD) was 0.3 (0.17) g/l. The mean follow-up time was 30.5 months and median 24 months. Anti-inflammatory doses of systemic steroids were started in 7/12 cases. External ophthalmoplegia/ophthalmoparesis improved in three cases with no medical treatment and in four with systemic steroids. Conclusion: Suspected oculomotor neuritis of unknown origin should be included as a differential diagnosis in dogs presenting with unilateral ophthalmoplegia/ophthalmoparesis.

Additionally, the values were compared considering sex and eye laterality. Methods: Eighteen adult monkeys (36 eyes) of Cebus apella species were used. Experimental procedures were approved by Ethical Committee (n.87/2012-CEEA) and performed according to ARVO. The IOL power calculation was performed using the Holladay IOL Consultant \u00e2 and EyeCalculator \u00e2 6.0 software. Holladay 2, Haigis and Hoffer Q, formulas were employed to calculate and determine the average refractive power of the lenses. Results: The average axial length, anterior chamber depth and keratometry readings were 16.38 mm, 2.15 mm and 63.15D, respectively. Only Haigis and Holladay 2 formulas used anterior chamber measurements. The average refractive power using Holladay 2, Haigis and Hoffer Q formulas were 29.43D, 31.25D and 46.71D, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the lens' dioptric valuescalculated by Holladay 2 and Haigis formulas; however, there was a statistical difference between groups when Hoffer Q formula was applied (P > 0.05), because it resulted in higher readings. The ocular biometric parameters evaluated and lens power calculated by the same formula showed no significant differences between males and females and between right and left eyes. Conclusion: The suggested IOL power in using fourth-generation formula (Holladay 2, Haigis) is around 30D, in contrast with the third-generation formula Hoffer Q which resulted in higher values.

There is little or no data on the prevalence of KCS in general practice. Methods: A point prevalence study was conducted in 20 Belgian veterinary practices. Relevant history and clinical signs, including corneal appearance and conjunctival hyperemia and edema, and Schirmer tear test (STT) results for left and right eyes were recorded for 1028 dogs, 12 of which were already being treated for KCS. Univariate analysis was performed using Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests. Results: STT was normal (\u226515 mm/min) in 87.06%, borderline (\u226510 to <15 mm/min) in 7.75% and low (<10 mm/min) in 4.75% of the 1016 dogs not on KCS treatment. Castrated male dogs (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.276, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.422-3.644, P = 0.0006) and dogs >5.5 years (OR 2.983, 95% CI 1.964-4.531, P < 0.0001) were more likely to have a STT <15 mm/min. Each of the clinical signs was significantly more likely to be present in dogs with a STT <15 mm/min (P < 0.05). KCS or a STT <15 mm/min was found in >15% of Bichon Frise, Chihuahua, Cocker spaniel, Pug, Shih Tzu, and Yorkshire terrier. Normal STT were found in >85% of French bulldog, Golden retriever, Labrador retriever, shepherds, Staffordshire bull terrier and crossbred dogs. Conclusion: A STT should form a routine part of the examination of dogs presenting with any signs of ocular inflammation. Screening for KCS should be considered in breeds with an apparent predisposition, especially in middle aged and older dogs. Support: The study was funded by MSD Animal Health Belgium. Norwegian Buhunds were screened for presumed inherited eye disease. Thirty-six dogs were examined on more than one occasion (2-6), resulting in a total of 232 examinations. Age at the time of examination ranged from 10 weeks to 15 years with a median age of 4.7 years at the first examination, and 5.6 years at the last examination. Seventy-nine dogs (46.75%) were male and 90 (53.25%) were female. All examinations were performed by the same person (EOR). PNC were categorized as minimal, mild, moderate or pronounced. Results: A total of 94 dogs (55.6%) were found to be affected by PNC at their last examination. Of these, 29 (30.9%) had minimal, 19 (20.2%) had mild, 27 (28.7%) had moderate, and 19 (20.2%) had pronounced PNC. Of 42 dogs examined before the age of 2 years, only 10 (23.8%) had PNC, all of which were minimal. The majority of re-examined dogs that had minimal or mild PNC at their first examination demonstrated gradual progression of PNC, but at highly variable rates. Five dogs that were free of PNC at early examinations (age 1.1-6.2 years) developed PNC at later stages. Conclusion: PNCs were found in 94 of 169 Norwegian Buhunds. The rate of progression was unpredictable, and the condition was not always detectable at young age.",
