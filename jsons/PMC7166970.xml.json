HMPV is an enveloped negative\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Metapneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae [van den Hoogen et al., 2004]. Serological studies indicate that most children below the age of 5 years will already have been infected by HMPV [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Ebihara et al., 2003]. It generally accounts for 5\u201315% of hospitalization for lower and upper acute respiratory infections in children and the clinical manifestations ranging from otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [Kahn, 2006; Feuillet et al., 2012]. Adults infected by HMPV usually only present with flu\u2010like symptoms [Boivin et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2008], but high morbidity is observed in the elderly and immunocompromised patients [Larcher et al., 2005; Kahn, 2006].",

Based on genetic differences, HMPV isolates are separated into two genotypes, A and B, with each genotype subdivided into two subtypes 1 and 2 [van den Hoogen et al., 2004]. Subtype A2 is further divided in two genetic lineage A2a and A2b [Huck et al., 2006]. HMPV has a seasonal distribution with peak incidence in winter and spring [Kahn, 2006; Mizuta et al., 2013]. Its circulation may vary each season and different genotypes can circulate simultaneously in variable proportions [Mackay et al., 2006; Gaunt et al., 2009; Pitoiset et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012b].",

However, epidemiological survey of outpatients is of unique importance for a comprehensive understanding of the current circulation pattern and clinical burden and for developing control strategies. A national influenza surveillance system which tracks influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) was launched in China in 2001 [Yang et al., 2009b]. Clinical samples of ILI patients are collected by sentinel hospitals every calendar week. In the present study, specimens from children with ILI were utilized to explore the circulation and epidemiology of HMPV in Wuhan, the largest city in central China which has a resident population over 10 million. Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay was employed to evaluate the prevalence of HMPV infection and phylogenetic characteristics of HMPV isolates were also investigated.",

After verbal informed consent was obtained from parents or caretakers, throat swabs were collected from study participants in 2.5 ml viral transport medium and were delivered to Wuhan Centers for Disease Prevention and Control for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Since the sentinel surveillance of ILI cases is covered by Chinese legislation (Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, article 17) and no extra sample was obtained for the study, ethic committee approval was not required.",

Gaps were treated by pairwise deletion and substitution rates were defined as uniform among sites but different among lineages. To confirm the robustness and reliability of the branching orders, 1,000 bootstraps were performed on the neighbor\u2010joining tree. Additional phylogenetic testing of the dataset was the maximum likelihood (ML) analysis performed by using IQPNNI (Important Quartet Puzzling and Nearest Neighbor Interchange, version 3.3.2) [Minh et al., 2005].

Interestingly, although HMPV infection in Wuhan occurred more frequently in children under the age of five as expected, the highest prevalence was in children aged between 2 and 4 years, not in younger infants like many previous studies described [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2004; Lambert et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011]. One explanation is that the risk of exposure is higher among children between 2 and 4 because they are just entering kindergartens in this age. The observation might also be related to the higher virulence of HMPV in infants and young children [Boivin et al., 2002]. The virus has been demonstrated to be second only to RSV as a cause of bronchiolitis in early childhood [Kahn, 2006], which leads to substantial proportion of hospitalization of younger patients. Children above 2 years old, on the other hand, are more immunocompetent and are more likely to become outpatient rather than be hospitalized during a HMPV infection.",

Three main epidemic peaks occurred first in the winter\u2010spring season in year 2008\u20132009 (November to February), then shifted to the spring\u2010summer season in year 2009\u20132010 (March to June), and finally back to the winter\u2010spring season in year 2012\u20132013 (November to March). Multiple researchers from Europe and Asia also observed similar biennial shifts between winter and spring seasonality of HMPV. A significantly higher prevalence was identified in summer peak in Austria [Aberle et al., 2010], in winter peak in Japan [Mizuta et al., 2013], but not in Beijing [Zhu et al., 2011], or Wuhan as shown in this study. Besides, the incidence of HMPV was not even in each season through the study. Two epidemic seasons with high viral activity were followed by two low activity epidemic seasons and again by a high activity epidemic season. The cause of different seasonality and yearly incidence is unclear. Our data did not support the assumption that circulation of different genotypes resulted in the change of temporal distribution, since no correlation was found between a certain HMPV genetic subgroup with high prevalence. But the possibility cannot be ruled out that environmental factors and circulation of other respiratory pathogens (such as the pandemic of A/H1N1/2009) have affected the epidemical dynamics of HMPV.",

Interestingly, a group of researchers from Chongqing, a city in Southwest China, has studied the epidemiology of HMPV among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections between July 2008 and March 2011, yet they observed quite different seasonal distribution and prevailing genotype from Wuhan: subtype A2b was predominant during the whole period and peaked in March to May 2009 and November 2010 to February 2011 [Zhang et al., 2012].

The only exception was an Italian study that reported the circulation of subtype A1 was predominant in season 2009\u20132010 [Apostoli et al., 2012]. The analysis of sequence diversity showed that nucleotide distance within HMPV subtypes was 0.007\u20130.011 and the corresponding amino acid distance was 0.000\u20130.004. Such low diversity might be explained by functional constraints on paramyxovirus fusion proteins that prevent progressive antigen drift [Yang et al., 2009a]. It has been identified that a region between residue 260\u2013300 on F1 subunit of fusion protein presents considerable variation [Yang et al., 2009a], but no amino acid substitution specific for Wuhan strains was noticed in this study. There were multiple closely related or even identical sequences from the same epidemic seasons or two consecutive seasons in clades B1 and B2, implicating that HMPV infections due to highly similar viruses within one period, at least in genotype B [Reiche et al., 2014].",
