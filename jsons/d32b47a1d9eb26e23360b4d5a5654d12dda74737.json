This virus is prevalent in herds throughout the world and continues to pose a significant threat as newer and more virulent disease phenotypes emerge. In this report we describe the full-length nucleotide sequence of a Canadian PRRSV isolate, designated PA8. A consecutive sequence of 15,411 nucleotides was obtained from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. In order to determine the extent of genetic variation among isolates recovered from swine in Canada and the US, as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of PRRSV, the full-length sequence of PA8 was compared with that of two US isolates, VR2332 and 16244B. The genomic sequence of PA8 shared 98.2% and 99.2% identity with 16244B and VR2332, respectively. The untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome were very well conserved. Notable exceptions include an eight nucleotide difference at the 5 end of the 5 UTR of VR2332 relative to PA8 and 16244B and a two nucleotide difference in the 3 UTR of PA8 relative to VR2332 and 16244B. In contrast to PA8 and VR2332, 16244B possessed two nucleotide differences within the RNA pseudoknot structure of the ribosomal frameshift region between open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b. Amino acid differences were distributed throughout the genome, however they appeared to be most extensive in Nsp1\u2424 and ORF5 of the nonstructural and structural coding regions, respectively, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to conserve these viral genes is somewhat lower. * The nucleotide sequence reported in this manuscript was deposited into GenBank database with the accession number AF176348.",

PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [4, 45] . The virus is comprised of a 15 kilobase (kb) single-stranded positive sense RNA genome that is encapsulated within an enveloped, icosahedral-shaped nucleocapsid [5] . The replicase gene covers the 5 -terminal four-fifths of the genome and is composed of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are expressed from the genomic RNA. ORF1b is expressed by means of a ribosomal frameshift mechanism [3] . With the exception of the newly characterized ORF2a [46] , the structural genes encoded by ORF2 to 7 are expressed from the 5 end of a co-terminal nested set of functionally monocistronic subgenomic mRNAs [28] .",

            "text": "PRRSV infection is characterized by mild to severe reproductive failure in breeding swine and respiratory disease in young pigs. The disease syndrome was first recognized in the United States in 1987 [22] and shortly thereafter it emerged in Europe [34] where the causative agent was originally isolated [53] . Since their isolation, the prototype North American (VR2332) [5] and European [Lelystad virus (LV)] [53] strains of PRRSV have been extensively characterized. Despite the fact that North American and European strains of PRRSV do not manifest appreciable differences in disease phenotype [17] , they are antigenically [31, 54, 55] and genotypically disparate [27, 32, 1] . In light of these differences, it has been proposed that two distinct species of PRRSV exist. Even within these distinct subgroups, however, there is precedence for strain divergence. Substantial sequence variation among North American isolates has been documented [2, 21, 30] . Such variation could be due to the innate errors of RNA polymerase or RNA recombination [51, 21] . Moreover, significant variation in the pathogenicity of American PRRSV isolates has been described [18, 26] . One such example is from a recent report describing a strain of PRRSV that causes severe encephalitis in neonatal pigs, a condition not normally associated with PRRSV infection [37] . Interestingly, this phenotype was particularly prevalent in herds that were using, or had recently used, a commercial modified-live vaccine.",

The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM3zf(+) and sequenced in both directions (Fig. 1 ). When the sequence in both directions did Table 1 not conform, samples were re-sequenced. The sequence data were assembled into one contiguous sequence of 15, 411 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail. The nucleotide sequence and genome organization of PA8 were similar to that of other arteriviruses ( Table 2 ). PA8 possessed a 5 UTR of 189 nucleotides and a 3 UTR of 151 nucleotides. Two large overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, of 7509 and 4389 nucleotides, respectively, followed the 5 UTR. Six additional overlapping ORFs were identified immediately downstream of ORF1b. These ORFs were able to encode the viral structural proteins of PRRSV for the minor membrane glycoproteins GP2a, GP3, GP4, a major membrane glycoprotein GP5, a membrane associated protein M, and the nucleocapsid protein N. A small internal open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 73 amino acids was identified within the ORF2a coding region and was designated ORF2b (Fig. 2) . The homolog of ORF2b is found in all other members of the arterivirus family and was recently shown, with the use of an EAV infectious clone, to be an essential component for virus replication [46] . The organization of this region of the genome differs significantly among members of the arterivirus family. Moreover, even the North American and European species of PRRSV differ considerably within this region. The upstream leader body junction, presumably utilized for the production of subgenomic mRNA2, is 20 nucleotides upstream of ORF2a in PA8 while it is located 38 nucleotides upstream of ORF2a in LV. Furthermore, there is only one nucleotide separating ORF1b from ORF2a in PA8, whereas there are 10 in the case of LV. PA8 represents the first Canadian PRRSV isolate for which the full-length sequence has been determined. During the course of this study, the full-length genomic sequence of two American PRRSV isolates, VR2332 and 16244B, became available. The full-length sequence of the prototype European isolate, LV was [32] , 16244B was reported by Allende et al. [1] and LV was reported by Meulenberg et al. [28] b Percentages of nucleotide indentity are presented above the diagonal c Absolute distances expressed as number of polymorphic sites are shown below the diagonal d Absolute distances between LV and VR2332/16244B/PA8 are expressed as the relative number of polymorphic sites within the 15088 nucleotide sequence of LV determined previously [28] . Therefore, it was of interest to compare the genomic sequence of PA8 with that of the three other full-length sequences available in order to evaluate the relative evolutionary pressure on viral genes to either conserve or change their amino acid sequence. Table 3 illustrates the relative nucleotide homology shared between these four strains of PRRSV. The three North American strains of PRRSV shared over 98% sequence identity with each other and only 60% sequence identity with LV, which suggests that the evolutionary pressures and constraints within North America differ from those in Europe.",

The 16244B 5 UTR differed from PA8 by only 2 nucleotides, both of which were T to C mutations conceivably due to pyrimidine wobble. The 7 nucleotides that differed between VR2332 and both PA8 and 16244B were located at the 5 -most end of the 5 UTR. Interestingly, this region, deemed the \"5 -leader start\" motif, was found to be one of three conserved domains shared between North American and European strains of PRRSV [33] . We attempted to amplify the 5 end of PA8 using primers specific for the 5 end of either VR2332 or 16244B. The 16244B specific primer consistently produced a product while, despite our efforts, this same region of PA8 could not be amplified using the VR2332 specific primer. This suggested that the 5 end of PA8 was more similar to 16244B. The leader-body junction sequence (UUAACC) as well as the string of 8-11-9 absolutely conserved nucleotides, described by Oleksiewicz et al. [33] , were identical among all four strains.",

The 3 UTR of PA8 differed from both VR2332 and 16244B by two nucleotides, one of which was located 2 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the poly(A) tail region. Length aside, the 3 UTR displayed a higher level of homology within the aligned regions than did the 5 UTR. However, in both the 3 UTR and 5 UTR, the degree of conservation was highest towards the 3 end which suggests that these regions may encode important cis-acting elements. In order to determine the approximate number of poly(A)s and in doing so, to increase the length of the templated poly (A) tail within a cDNA clone of the 3 end of the genome, the Poly(A) Test (PAT) described by Salles et al. [40] was employed. PAT involves first saturating the poly(A) with phosphorylated oligonucleotides (dT) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and then ligating these oligonucleotides together at 42 \u2022 C. This process generates a nearly full-length complementary copy of the poly(A) tail, leaving only a short 3 overhang of oligo(A) as a result of the instability of short A/dT hybrids at 42 \u2022 C [40] . An oligo(dT)-anchor primer was then added in excess with respect to oligo(dT) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and the temperature lowered to 12 \u2022 C to favour the hybridization and ligation of the oligo(dT)-anchor to the extreme 3 end of the poly(A) tail. After ligation, the sample was reverse transcribed and the poly(dT)-anchor stretch that had annealed to the extreme 3 end of the poly(A) tail served as the reverse primer. For determination of the PA8 poly(A) tail length, an ORF7 specific forward primer (ORF7-Fwd) was used. A second reaction using the same forward primer in combination with a reverse primer (3 UTR-RV) specific for the extreme 3 end of the 3 UTR was performed to illustrate the molecular weight contribution of the poly(A) tail region (Fig. 4A) . Results from the PAT experiment are shown in Fig. 4B . The product migrating at 520 bp was amplified using the ORF7-Fwd and the 3 UTR-RV primer-pair (lane 2) while the sample migrating at 592 bp was amplified using the ORF7-Fwd and the poly(dT)-anchor primer-pair (lane 3).

These include Nsp1\u2423, Nsp1\u2424 [8] , and Nsp2 to Nsp8 [52, 42] ( Table 2 ). The N-terminal Nsp1\u2423 and Nsp1\u2424 each contain a papainlike cysteine protease domain which serves to cleave the Nsp1\u2423/1\u2424 and Nsp1\u2424/2 junctions, respectively (Fig. 5 ) [8] . In PA8, the C76-H147 and C270-H339 residues, which likely form the catalytic dyads of PCP\u2423 and PCP\u2424 respectively, are conserved as are the predicted cleavage sites. Based on the size of the Nsp1\u2423 cleavage product [8] , and amino acid homology between LDV [12] and PRRSV, the cleavage site for Nsp1\u2423/1\u2424 was predicted to be located between amino acids 163-166 [8] . In The putative cleavage site for the Nsp1\u2423 papainlike cysteine protease is shown by a black arrow as is the cleavage site for the Nsp1\u2424 papainlike cysteine protease. The hatched arrow and grey arrowheads indicate potential cleavage sites for the putative CP and SP, respectively. The hydropathy plot generated for ORF1ab is shown below the schematic diagram. Values above the axis indicate hydrophobicity and values below indicate hydrophilicity. Amino acids are plotted along the y-axis [1] , the Nsp1\u2423/1\u2424 cleavage site was predicted to be Q166/R167. The Nsp1\u2424/2 cleavage site appears to be between Y382/G383 [8] . The Nsp1\u2423 region was highly conserved among the three North American strains examined. PA8 and VR2332 shared 99.4% nucleotide (Fig. 6A ) and 100% amino acid identity (Fig. 7) while PA8 and 16244B shared 98.8% nucleotide and 98.8% amino acid identity. Both of the amino acid differences in 16244B were conservative in nature (Fig. 7) . PA8 Nsp1\u2424 was the most variable of the ORF1a processing products, sharing 98.9% and 96.8% nucleotide homology with VR2332 and 16244B, respectively (Fig. 6A ). VR2332 and 16244B differed from PA8 in this region by 5 and 10 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 7) . In both cases, 80% of these changes were nonconservative.",

This is particularly true for the Nsp2 of LV which possesses three large, centrally located deletions of 14, 78 and 31 amino acids relative to North American strains of PRRSV. The LDV and EAV Nsp2 proteins are only 733 and 401 residues long, respectively [7, 12] , while the North American PRRSV Nsp2 is 981.

The heptanucleotide slippery sequence, UUUAAAC, located 3 nucleotides upstream of the ORF1a stop codon is strictly conserved between both species of PRRSV. Conversely, the sequence forming the stem-loop structure downstream of the slippery sequence, appears to be able to accommodate mutations. The PA8 and VR2332 ORF1a/ORF1b junction sequences are identical, however, the 16244B junction sequence differs by two nucleotides due to purine wobble, one of which does not appear to affect base-pairing within the stem region (Fig. 8) . A change from A to G at position 7711 within the large stem region of the 16244B pseudoknot does however alter base pairing, resulting in a change from A-U as in VR2332 and PA8 to G-U. This change results in a slight reduction of the free energy from G \u2022 = \u221229.9 as in PA8 to \u221229.0 kJ according to the mfold program [56] . Interestingly, LV possesses the same nucleotide change, however a compensatory nucleotide change was made such that a G-C base pair results. LV differs at 7 other positions, one of which is located within the small stem and results in a base pair change from U-A to U-G (Fig. 8) .",

ORF1b is synthesized as a fusion with ORF1a via a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism which produces a polyprotein of approximately 3960 amino acids [3, 19] . The ORF1b part of the replicase contains a set of highly conserved functions which are essential for viral RNA replication and mRNA transcription [7, 49] .

Each protein, with the exception of ORF2b, is translated from a separate subgenomic mRNA [6] . The consensus intergenic sequence for these mRNAs in North American PRRSV is 5 - [32] , whereas in LV it is 5 -[U/C/A]AACC-3 [6] . The intergenic sequences for all 3 North American strains were perfectly conserved. In the interest of comparing pathogenic and attenuated strains of American type PRRSV, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the structural genes of VR2332, 16244B, three Danish isolates of American type PRRSV (DK5163-23, DK5163-17 and DK3016-12) [25] and the American type modified live vaccine (MLV) RespPRRS [16] were compared with PA8. RespPRRS, registered in Europe as Ingelvac PRRSV MLV, is a live vaccine derived from the virulent American field isolate VR2332 [5] . The nucleotide and amino acid differences observed among the American isolates are summarized in Fig. 9A and 9B, respectively. Amino acid differences occurred in all of the structural proteins with the exception of N which shared 100% amino acid identity among all 7 isolates examined. This suggests that N may not be the focus of antibody or other host defenses during the course of PRRSV infection. Relative to all the isolates examined, PA8 differed the most in the GP5 coding region. Only one amino acid difference resulted in the deletion of a potential N-glycosylation site according to the consensus NxT/S, where x cannot be P. The Danish isolate DK5163-17 possessed an N to T mutation at amino acid residue 33 of GP5 (position 601, Fig. 9B ). In two of the Danish isolates; DK5163-17 and DK5163-23, a mutation from D to N at position 34 in GP5 (position 602, Fig. 9B ) resulted in the addition of a putative N-glycosylation site. GP5 contains a hypervariable region within the ectodomain which is thought to be responsible for generating diversity in field isolates [2, 38] and it is possible that this ectodomain may define a region under selection by antibody or other host defenses [13] . Interestingly, in a study addressing the possible origin of PRRSV diversity in ORF5, the emergence of distinct PRRSV populations was characterized by a single amino acid change from D to N at position 34 in the ectodomain of GP5 [38] .",

All three strains displayed high nucleotide and amino acid homology. Of the 119 nucleotide differences within the coding regions between VR2332 and PA8, only 57.1% resulted in amino acid changes and 74% of these changes were nonconservative. Similarly, 16244B differed from PA8 by 274 nucleotides, 38% of which resulted in amino acid changes. Approximately 74% of the amino acid changes in 16244B were nonconservative in nature. Although an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions occurred, the majority of nucleotide changes did not result in amino acid changes, suggesting an evolutionary pressure to conserve amino acid sequences.",

Since VR2332 was one of the first isolated and characterized American strains of PRRSV and, in the light of the similarity that PA8 and 16244B share with VR2332, it is possible that these viruses are field strain derivatives of VR2332. RespPRRS. The tree was generated based on alignment of the entire structural coding region of ORF2 to 7 using the evolutionary alignment program of the GCG software package [9] However, since some of the animals on the farm in Alberta had been vaccinated (MLV RespPRRS is derived from VR2332) this lends support to the idea that spread of the vaccine virus may account for the high degree of similarity between PA8 and VR2332. A phylogenetic tree was generated from the comparison of VR2332, 16244B, three American type Danish isolates and the RespPRRS vaccine with PA8 (Fig. 10) . The Danish isolates used in the comparison of the structural proteins of PRRSV were chosen because they are suspected to have originated from the VR2332-based vaccine virus due to spread to uninfected animals [25] . Results from the evolutionary analysis indicate that PA8 is most closely related to RespPRRS and that both of these viruses are very similar to VR2332. These results suggest that PA8 may have originated due to spread of the vaccine virus to uninfected animals in the herd and subsequent reversion to virulence.",

The relative length and position of the cDNA clones which were used in the sequence analysis of the PA8 genome are depicted by solid black bars and are named according to the primer pairs used for amplification as indicated in",

The difference in size between the two PCR products is due to the length of the poly(A) tail products represents the length of the poly(A) tail. The 592 bp product (lane 3) was cloned two times from two separate reactions. Each of these clones was sequenced twice and the length of the poly(A) tail was determined to be 72, thereby extending the total number of templated nucleotides. Although this length does not necessarily reflect that of a virus in a natural pig infection, it does provide some information about poly(A) tail length during infection. Furthermore, this information may be important to consider when constructing an infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV.",
