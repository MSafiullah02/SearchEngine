            "text": "Autophagy is dependent upon lysosomes, which fuse with the autophagosome to complete the autophagic process and whose acidic interior permits the activity of their intraluminal degradative enzymes. Chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA) each cause alkalinisation of the lumen and thus impair lysosomal function, although by distinct mechanisms. CQ diffuses into lysosomes and undergoes protonation, while BafA inhibits the ability of the vacuolar type H + -ATPase (v-ATPase) to transfer protons into the lysosome. In the present study, we examine the impact of CQ and BafA on the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), inhibition of which is an early step in promoting autophagy. We find each compound inhibits mTORC1 signalling, without affecting levels of protein components of the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, these effects are not related to these agents' capacity to inhibit autophagy or the reduction in amino acid supply from lysosomal proteolysis. Instead, our data indicate that the reduction in mTORC1 signalling appears to be due to the accumulation of lysosomal storage material. However, there are differences in responses to these agents, for instance, in their abilities to up-regulate direct targets of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a substrate of mTORC1 that drives transcription of many lysosomal and autophagy-related genes. Nonetheless, our data imply that widely used agents that alkalinise intralysosomal pH are mimetics of acute lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and emphasise the importance of considering the result of CQ and BafA on mTORC1 signalling when interpreting the effects of these agents on cellular physiology.",

            "text": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a heteromeric protein kinase which phosphorylates a diverse array of substrates. It thereby activates multiple anabolic cellular processes, including protein synthesis, lipogenesis, and ribosome biogenesis, while also inhibiting catabolic processes, in particular, autophagy [1] . mTORC1 phosphorylates the protein kinase Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), thereby inhibiting its ability to stimulate autophagy [2] . In addition, the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes transcription of numerous genes encoding proteins involved in autophagy, is inhibited as a result of its phosphorylation by mTORC1 [3] and thus promotes lysosomal biogenesis [4, 5] . Thus, mTORC1 suppresses autophagy in two distinct and complementary ways: one acting acutely (via ULK1) and the other over a longer term (TFEB).",

            "text": "Autophagy requires the function of lysosomes whose acidic interior permits the activity of their intraluminal degradative enzymes, such as acidophilic proteases. Furthermore, mTORC1 is activated on the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes by two different types of GTPases; Rheb mediates the activation of mTORC1 in response to hormones and growth factors that act via cell surface receptors, while the Rag GTPases relay information about the availability of amino acids, which positively regulate mTORC1 signalling [6] . The Rag GTPases are associated with Ragulator complex, which is tethered to the lysosome through the vacuolar type H + -ATPase (v-ATPase) [7] . The significance of lysosomes as the platform on which mTORC1 is regulated may, at least in part, reflect the fact that proteolysis within the lysosome could provide amino acids to help sustain mTORC1 activity [8] [9] [10] . Given that mTORC1 controls autophagy, another role for the lysosomal association of mTORC1 may be to allow mTORC1 to sense autophagic/lysosomal function and be regulated by it in times of lysosomal dysfunction, such as during reduced clearance of substrates [11] .",

            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ) alkalinises the lumen of the lysosome and thus inhibits its pH-sensitive functions, although its mode of action is yet to be conclusively elucidated. The most likely explanation is that CQ enters the lysosome by diffusion, but upon protonation to CQ 2+ , cannot diffuse out of the intralysosomal environment [12] . By mopping-up protons, this compound increases intralysosomal pH, and inhibits both intralysosomal proteolysis and fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome (and ultimately autophagy) [12, 13] . Indeed, the utility of CQ as a pharmaceutical agent to treat malaria is based on its acidotropic nature, and its characteristic of entering, but, when protonated, being unable to leave the digestive vacuole of this parasite when they are inside red blood cells. In this case, however, CQ forms a complex with haem, which in turn disrupts membrane function to the point of high toxicity to the malarial protozoan [14, 15] . Recent interest has focused on the utility of CQ derivatives such as hydroxychloroquine in treating infections of the novel coronavirus termed as COVID-19 which have reached pandemic status [16] . Bafilomycin A1 (BafA) de-acidifies the lysosome in an indirect way by inhibiting the v-ATPase [17, 18] , which normally transfers protons into the lysosome to maintain its low pH.",

We thus first examined whether treating cells with BafA affected mTORC1 signalling by applying the commonly used procedure of assessing the phosphorylation of its downstream effectors in whole cell extracts via immunoblotting [7, 8] , which is more informative regarding intracellular mTORC1 activity than attempting to measure the activity of mTORC1 after isolation from cells which does not yield reliable results. To this end, human lung carcinoma A549 and cervical cancer HeLa cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM AZD8055 (an inhibitor of mTOR kinase activity, and thus a control that impairs mTOR signalling) or 200 nM BafA (a commonly used concentration [22] and within the range recommended by manufacturers) for 6 or 24 h. Cells were lysed and samples immunoblotted for LC3-II, a protein that is incorporated into the membrane of autophagosomes during their formation upon processing of LC3-I [23] . It thus serves as a positive control for the efficacy of BafA, as its levels are a marker for the presence of autophagosomes, which accumulate during lysosomal alkalinisation because of the inhibition of fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome. As expected, BafA treatment caused LC3-II levels to become detectable after 6 h of treatment and increase markedly after 24 h of treatment ( Figure 1 ). The same samples were also probed for rpS6. Its phosphorylation serves as a robust readout of mTORC1 activity, since rpS6 is phosphorylated at Serine 240 and 244 specifically by p70S6K, which is itself activated by direct phosphorylation of Thr 389 by mTORC1 [24] [25] [26] . BafA caused a reduction in the levels of rpS6 P-S240/244 (relative to total rpS6), the effect increasing at the later time point. This indicates that BafA induces an impairment of mTORC1 signalling.",

For instance, it has been observed previously that treatment of HeLa cells for 5 h with CQ resulted in no decrease in acidity of the lysosome, as determined by the use of LysoTracker Red DND-99, a fluorescent probe that can permeate cell membranes and label acidic organelles (specifically, the lysosome) [13] . To confirm and assess the ability of CQ or BafA to alkalinise the lysosome, A549 cells were treated for 1, 2, and 6 h with either of these chemicals. Prior to fixing the cells, medium was supplemented with LysoTracker Red DND-99. Detection of LysoTracker-stained lysosomes was ablated ( Figure 2 ) as early as the 1 h time-point with either CQ or BafA, indicating that alkalinisation precedes impairment of mTORC1 signalling by several hours. Indeed, there was no reduction in rpS6 phosphorylation at the 1 and 2 h time points of CQ and BafA treatment (Supplementary Figure S2 ). This delay in itself implies that reduced mTORC1 activity is not a direct consequence of lysosomal alkalinisation itself and/or (with respect to BafA) inhibition of the v-ATPase, as those effects of the compounds are much more rapid.",

Supplementation of the medium with CQ and BafA expectedly increased LC3-II levels, but there were no significant changes in the levels of the other proteins studied (Figure 3 ). It is thus unlikely that lysosomal alkalinisation impairs mTORC1 signalling by affecting the expression of mTORC1 components mTOR and RAPTOR, or its upstream regulators TSC1/2, but rather impacts the regulation of mTORC1.",

            "text": "Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that CQ or BafA treatment each caused a similar increase in the area of sheep anti-LAMP-1 antibody staining as a result of larger lysosomal volume ( Figure 4A ). This is as expected, because each chemical inhibits lysosomal functions and induces the build-up of undigested macromolecules (or storage material) [28, 29] . Indeed, an increase in LAMP-1 protein was confirmed via immunoblotting ( Figure 4B ). Under normal conditions, a proportion of mTOR co-localised with LAMP-1-stained lysosomes ( Figure 4A ). However, treatment with CQ or BafA ablated the punctate staining of mTOR and decreased the fraction of mTOR localised to the lysosome, with CQ causing a greater reduction than BafA ( Figure 4A ,C). Intriguingly, although the fraction of LAMP-1 localising with mTOR was also significantly reduced when cells were treated with CQ (demonstrating an overall reduction in co-localisation), this was not the case with BafA ( Figure 4C ). In more detail, staining patterns demonstrate a spatial exclusion of mTOR from LAMP-1 upon CQ treatment and this is confirmed with the respective Mander's coefficients ( Figure 4A ,C). In contrast, with BafA treatment, although mTOR is no longer stained in a punctate manner as it is in the control ( Figure 4A ) and there is a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of mTOR associating with LAMP-1, the amount of LAMP-1 localising with mTOR did not change ( Figure 4A ,C). Unlike the situation for CQ, we cannot therefore conclude that BafA reduces mTOR/LAMP-1 co-localisation, when accounting for both Mander's coefficients. However, these results might be confounded by the increase in total LAMP-1 ( Figure  4B) .",

Therefore, we tested the possibility that increasing the supply of extracellular amino acids could restore mTORC1 activity in cells treated with CQ or BafA by compensating for a reduced supply of amino acids from intralysosomal proteolysis, this time by evaluating levels of p70S6K P-T389, which is the direct substrate of mTORC1 [30] .",

The addition of amino acids to cells that were already in complete medium did not significantly rescue the decreased phospho-S6 or phospho-p70S6K levels caused by CQ or BafA.

Cells were fixed and visualised by confocal fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 5C ). In control conditions, punctate staining consistent with the expected distribution of lysosomal cathepsin L activity was observed. A similar pattern was also observed in AZD8055-treated cells; also noteworthy was the additional enlargement of the lysosome, which was expected on account of AZD8055's ability to directly inhibit mTORC1 activity and thus promote TFEB transactivation and lysosomal biogenesis. Conversely, there was a marked reduction in red fluorescence when cells were exposed to CQ, BafA, or leupeptin, confirming their ability to (indirectly) inhibit intralysosomal proteolysis ( Figure 5C ). Lysates of similarly treated A549 and HeLa cells were then immunoblotted with antibodies for total and phospho-rpS6 and \u03b2-actin. (Figure 5D ). In summary, unlike CQ and BafA, leupeptin did not decrease rpS6 phosphorylation, indicating it did not affect mTORC1 signalling. It is therefore likely that neither CQ nor BafA reduces mTORC1 activity by (indirectly) inhibiting intralysosomal proteolysis and the supply of amino acids, consistent with the conclusions from the amino acid-supplementation experiments.",

As mentioned previously, CQ and BafA inhibit this process even under basal conditions, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and material within them that would otherwise be degraded [31] . Another way of inhibiting autophagy involves reducing autophagosome number by depleting the expression of the BECN1 mRNA and thus beclin-1 protein. A549 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or one directed to BECN1 and, after 72 h, were analysed by immunoblotting with antibodies to LC3-II, p62 (a protein, encoded by SQSTM1, that is targeted to and degraded by the autophagosome), total and phospho-rpS6 and \u03b2-actin ( Figure 6 ). The inhibition of autophagy was observed upon the knockdown of BECN1 as shown by a statistically significant reduction in LC3-II levels and concomitant increase in p62 protein (P=0.0665). However, there was no change in phospho-rpS6 levels. Therefore, impairment of autophagy alone in conditions of nutrient abundance does not inhibit mTORC1 activity, and the effects of BafA and CQ on this pathway likely reflect another aspect of their effects on intralysosomal pH.",

We therefore evaluated whether sucrose mimicked the consequences of lysosomal alkalinisation. To this end, A549 and HeLa cells were treated with sucrose for 24, 48, or 72 h and then analysed by immunoblotting. In both lines, there was an increase in LAMP-1 protein when compared with untreated cells (Supplementary Figure S5A ,B), indicating increased lysosomal biogenesis [4, 33] . Concomitant increases in LC3-II and p62 are typically attributed to inhibition of autophagosome turnover [31] , although these conclusions are complicated by the fact that p62/SQSTM1 is also a TFEB target gene. Under normal conditions, mTORC1 is tethered to the cytoplasmic side of the lysosomal membrane and displays kinase activity towards Serine 142 and 211 in TFEB, which causes retention of TFEB in the cytoplasm [3] . Under conditions of cellular stress, such as nutrient starvation or lysosomal stress, mTORC1 is released from the lysosomal membrane and cannot phosphorylate TFEB, thus permitting translocation of TFEB to the nucleus and increased expression of target genes linked to autophagy and lysosomal function [4, 11, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . To evaluate the notion that TFEB is activated, RNA derived from identically treated cells was analysed for p62 transcript levels by qPCR (Supplementary Figure 5C) .",

Indeed, this proposed scenario is consistent with the previously observed rapid translocation of TFEB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in HeLa cells when similarly treated [4] . Furthermore, since it was possible that the effects of sucrose on mTORC1 signalling were also still transient, but more rapid, in HeLa cells, we treated both HeLa and A549 cells for shorter times (2, 6, as well as 24 h) with sucrose. This treatment ('lysosomal storage') resulted in the inactivation of mTORC1, as indicated by the significant reduction in phosphorylation of rpS6 P-S240/244 (when compared with total rpS6) after 2 or 6 h sucrose treatment in both cell lines ( Figure 7A,B) . Further supporting the notion that mTORC1 is inactivated at these time points, there was a decrease in p62 protein after 2 h of sucrose exposure ( Figure 7A,B) . It is likely that, at this acute stage, mTORC1 inactivity has derepressed ULK1-mediated inhibition of autophagy, but it is still too early for any concomitant TFEB-induced increase in p62 protein to be apparent. Nonetheless, provoking storage of material in lysosomes results in a rapid and transient inhibition of mTORC1 signalling in both cell types. Finally, to assess whether sucrose treatment caused alkalinisation of the lysosome, we employed LysoTracker Red DND-99. The extent of detection of LysoTracker-stained lysosomes was unaltered by sucrose treatments at all time points, ruling out that sucrose affects mTORC1 signalling by raising intralysosomal pH ( Figure 7C ).",

After 24 h, in HeLa cells, BafA treatment resulted in a striking increase in the mRNA levels of all three direct TFEB targets (as a ratio against \u03b2-actin expression) when compared with those of the untreated control, which was also statistically significant for p62 and BECN1 (for LAMP-1, P=0.0604) ( Figure 8A ).

In contrast, in A549 cells, both CQ and BafA treatment caused a similar and significant increase in TFEB target gene expression ( Figure 8B ).

AMPK is activated under conditions of reduced cellular 'energy' (ATP) levels, when AMP concentrations rise. AMPK can inhibit mTORC1 both directly (via phosphorylation of Serines 722 and 792 of RAPTOR, a key component of mTORC1) [41] and indirectly (through phosphorylation of Thr 1227 and Ser 1345 of TSC2, which in turn deactivates the mTORC1 activator, Rheb) [42] . AMPK also associates with and phosphorylates ULK1 at S317 and S777, thereby activating it [43] [44] [45] [46] . As the function of the v-ATPase is inhibited by BafA, but not CQ, we deemed it relevant to evaluate whether these compounds differed in their ability to promote activation of AMPK, particularly in light of their differing effects on the expression of TFEB target genes in HeLa cells ( Figure 8A) . First, to assess the possible role of AMPK in CQ-and/or BafA-induced mTORC1 inhibition, HeLa and A549 cells were treated with CQ, BafA, or AZD8055, or starved for amino acids for 30 min (after growth in serum-free medium for 23.5 h). Furthermore, in both cell lines, BafA caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of S79 in ACC, an AMPK substrate, indicating activation of AMPK. However, CQ did not elicit this effect in HeLa cells, while in A549 cells, the CQ-induced increase in phospho-ACC was smaller than that caused by BafA. Intriguingly, at shorter durations of treatment (1, 2, or 6 h), neither CQ nor BafA affected ACC phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S2) . This indicates CQ and BafA have different effects on AMPK activity after 24 h. Given that both compounds impair mTORC1 signalling, mechanisms other than activation of AMPK are likely involved, especially for CQ.",

However, while de-acidification of the lysosomal lumen occurs rapidly (Figure 2 ), only longer term treatment of human cells with CQ or BafA results in impairment of mTORC1 activity (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2 ), suggesting such inhibition is a consequence of alkalinisation rather than altered pH being the proximal cause. This is likely at least in part a consequence of the decrease in localisation of mTOR with LAMP1-stained lysosomes, given that the lysosomal surface is a major locus for the activation of mTORC1 [8] (Figure 4) . Additionally, although CQ and BafA each inhibit autophagy by increasing intralysosomal pH, it is unlikely that inhibition of autophagy is itself responsible, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of BECN1 did not affect mTORC1 signalling ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, as leupeptin (which inhibits cysteine, serine and threonine peptidases without altering lysosomal pH [31] ) did not alter phospho-rpS6 levels ( Figure 5C,D) , it is also unlikely that ablated intralysosomal proteolysis and any associated depletion of intralysosomally generated amino acids impair mTORC1 signalling. This conclusion is supported by our observation that increased supply of extracellular amino acids failed to rescue the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling caused by either CQ or BafA ( Figure 5A,B) .",

Two observations from these data nonetheless require qualification. Firstly, CQ-and BafA-induced inhibition of mTORC1 requires a longer duration of treatment than does exposure to sucrose. This may reflect an indirect effect of CQ and BafA whereby they induce lysosomal storage (and consequent mTORC1 inactivation) secondary to lysosomal alkalinisation and inhibit metabolic enzymes causing the gradual accumulation of undegraded macromolecules, whereas sucrose-induced 'storage' is quicker as the storage material is sucrose itself. This notion is supported by the observation in in earlier studies [4] that sucrose induces the rapid translocation of TFEB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Secondly, at longer time points, there is an increase in p62 and LC3-II proteins (Supplementary Figure S5A,B) , together suggesting an inhibition of autophagy, as well as an increase in the mRNA levels of p62 (Supplementary Figure S5C) , which are typically associated with enhanced TFEB activity and autophagy. Two contrasting processes thus appear to be occurring: an inhibition of autophagic flux and a transcriptional response associated with increased expression of lysosomal and autophagy genes. Previously, in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus from Alzheimer's disease patients, an up-regulation of the network of genes regulated by TFEB was observed, along with a decrease in autophagic flux due to an inability to clear the accumulated substrate [47] . Therefore, our data with respect to sucrose treatment of A549 and HeLa cells provide a further similarity between lysosomal alkalinisation and substrate storage caused by reduced lysosomal clearance.",

            "text": "In summary, our results using sucrose are consistent with previous observations of a TFEB-induced (and thus mTORC1-regulated) transcriptional response to lysosomal dysfunction [4, 11] . This is conceptually novel as we propose that CQ and BafA ultimately exert their effects on the endo-lysosomal network in a similar mechanistic fashion to that of accumulation of substrates within the lysosome. Indeed, altered mTORC1 signalling has commonly been demonstrated as a component of diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction. These include (with the mutated gene in parentheses): juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN3) [48] ; Scheie syndrome (IDUA) [49] ; aspartylglucosaminuria (AGA) [49] ; Fabry disease (GLA) [49, 50] ; cystinosis (CTNS) [51] . In the final case, the scenario is complicated by the authors' finding that the product of CTNS interacts with the v-ATPase-Ragulator-RagGTPase complex, so the effect in this example is more likely to be a direct one. In another recent study, mTORC1 signalling is impaired in myotubes into which a mutation linked to Pompe's disease (a genetic disorder in which lysosomal function is affected by deficiency in the enzyme \u03b1-glucosidase, which normally breaks down glycogen within lysosomes) has been introduced [52] . However, this is a quite distinct situation as mTOR remains associated with lysosomes (on account of the hyperactivation of the v-ATPase) but instead its negative regulator, TSC2, is recruited to these organelles to inactivate mTORC1. Overall, therefore, rather than being described merely as inhibitors of autophagy, it would be more appropriate to consider CQ and BafA, like sucrose, as mimetics of LSDs at the cellular level, as, in addition, they also promote certain aspects of autophagic flux (such as TFEB activation) via mTORC1 inactivation.",

            "text": "Additional considerations are raised by our observations of greater inhibition of mTORC1 activity by BafA than CQ, with respect to reduced rpS6 phosphorylation ( Figures 1B, 5B ,D, and 9A) and increased mRNA levels of TFEB target genes ( Figure 8A ) in HeLa cells. The fact that CQ impairs mTORC1 signalling indicates that lysosomal alkalinisation itself impacts on mTORC1 signalling, while the somewhat greater effect of BafA might indicate that interference with the v-ATPase, a partner for Ragulator, exerts additional effects on mTORC1 [8] . Furthermore, while 24-h BafA treatment also caused a significant increase in AMPK activity (seen as phosphorylation of ACC S79) in both cell lines (Figure 9 ), a similar effect for CQ (albeit modest, when compared with that elicited by BafA) was only evident in A549 cells ( Figure 9 ). In HeLa cells it appears that inhibition of the v-ATPase itself, rather than lysosomal alkalinisation, is a trigger for AMPK activation in this line. As BafA quickly promotes lysosomal de-acidification (Figure 2) , it was surprising that shorter durations of treatment with BafA (1-6 h) failed to alter ACC phosphorylation and thus AMPK activation (Supplementary Figure S2) , because a more rapid response to BafA would be consistent with recent observations that link the v-ATPase to activation of AMPK [39] . During nutrient stress, a complex consisting of AXIN and LKB1 interacts with the v-ATPase, promoting the phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 and thus the activation of AMPK [39] . However, as A549 and HeLa cells do not express detectable levels of LKB1 [53, 54] , this mechanism cannot operate in them, perhaps explaining why longer BafA treatment is required to activate AMPK. The reason that BafA activates AMPK, while CQ only does so to a much more limited extent, probably reflects the fact the former affects the v-ATPase directly, while CQ does not [39] . At any rate, independent of the exact mechanism, the chronic effect of BafA to inhibit mTORC1 may ultimately involve both activation of AMPK and lysosomal alkalinisation, while CQ, by exerting only the latter effect, impairs mTORC1 signalling more modestly. A similar pattern was seen for the abilities of CQ and BafA to up-regulate known TFEB targets; in HeLa cells, BafA treatment for 24 h led to increased levels of three known direct TFEB targets (LAMP-1, BECN, and p62), whereas CQ caused only a modest up-regulation of p62 and BECN1 ( Figure 8A ). There may also be differences between cell lines (Figures 8B and 9 ). In summary, lysosomal alkalinisation is sufficient to inhibit mTORC1 activity, although additional signalling mechanisms likely contribute to the stronger responses to BafA. Indeed, it should be noted that other differences have been seen between the effects of CQ and BafA, such as on the organisation of certain organelles, e.g., the Golgi [13] . This factor may give rise to differences in their overall effects. However, the common means by which both compounds act as mimetics of acute LSDs is via their shared capacity to induce the alkalinisation of the lumen of the lysosome, the accumulation of intralysosomal storage material (the defining characteristic of LSDs) and subsequently also the impairment of mTORC1 activity.",

We note that there is also a contrasting report that, in osteoclasts, alkalinisation of the lysosome (via exposure to CQ or ammonium chloride) increases mTORC1 activity, an effect which was associated with increased mTOR protein levels [56] . Enhanced mTORC1 activity resulting from increased lysosomal pH caused by treatment with CQ and (more potently) BafA has also been observed in chondrocytes (but without an increased level of mTOR protein) [57] .
