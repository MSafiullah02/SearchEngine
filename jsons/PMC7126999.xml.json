Taking into account their mechanisms of action, therapeutic agents belong to different pharmacological classes. Among them, those which interact with DNA, such as DNA alkylating agents, intercalators or groove binders, are of special interest.1, 2, 3 Intercalators constitute a well explored class of compounds because their mode of action is the most predictable and relies on inhibition of replication process by reversible binding to DNA.4, 5 The planar aromatic fragments of intercalators insert into the DNA double helix, thereby distorting the DNA backbone conformation and poison the DNA topoisomerases I or II.6 Several factors are responsible for stabilization a drug\u2013DNA complex, namely stacking \u03c0-bond interactions, van der Waals forces and eventually hydrogen bonding between the aromatic fragment of a drug moiety and the purine/pyrimidine bases present in DNA strains. Intercalators can be classified according to their aromatic/heteroaromatic subunit or electrostatic potential they posses.2, 3 Among them, naphthalimide derivatives have been found promising as anticancer agents since they are able to intercalate into DNA and some of them, including amonafide 1\n7, 8 and mitonafide 2,9 have reached clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors, however most of them showed poor therapeutic indices.",

The amino group of a sugar residue in doxorubicin 3 forms an ionic bond with the phosphate function of the DNA which results in additional and very efficient stabilization of locking the drug into an active site.10 There are also known groups of intercalators which activities are related to the specific shape of molecule rather than their aromatic ring system. Studies on intercalating properties of 2-[(arylmethyl)amino]-2-methyl-1,3-propanodiols (AMAPs) 4 proved that the amino side chain is responsible for DNA binding due to electrostatic interactions and enhanced activity which was observed for derivatives with 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety (Fig. 1\n).11, 12\n",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.

HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to adhere and proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of further incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
