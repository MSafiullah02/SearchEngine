It has been hypothesized that this pattern mimics secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), an under-recognised, hyper-inflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant hyper-cytokinaemia, excessive coagulation activation and multiorgan failure. 5 In the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 the cytokine IL-6 seems to play a dominant role.",

Genentech has recently announced a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with tocilizumab for severe COVID-19. In addition, side effects of tocilizumab seem significant and will not only need systematic evaluation but also proper offset against potential benefits of tocilizumab.",

Apart from the prominent role of IL-6 in the host-defense response in COVID19 it may be that specific beneficial effects of tocilizumab on the coagulation abnormalities associated with COVID-19 are also relevant. Many patients with severe COVID-19 infections present with a coagulopathy that is reminiscent but also distinct of other systemic coagulopathies associated with severe infections, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic microangiopathy. 16, 17 The occurrence of this coagulopathy in COVID-19 infected patients is associated with a higher risk of death. In addition, patients with this coagulopathy have a very high risk of thromboembolic complications. 18 In experimental and clinical studies in bacterial sepsis IL-6 was shown to be the pivotal cytokine in the upregulation and expression of tissue factor on mononuclear cells and possibly endothelial cells. 19 Infusion of a monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody resulted in the complete abrogation of coagulation activation in experimental sepsis. 20 In addition, studies in cancer patients receiving recombinant IL-6",

            "text": "Initial clinical observations fromChina have shown an improvement in pneumonia and associated symptoms in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab.13 Subsequently, several retrospective cohort studies have focused on the efficacy and safety of this treatment. In this issue of the European Journal of Internal Medicine three groups of authors report on the use of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19. Campochiaro et al. studied 65 patients with COVID-19 that were admitted to the hospital, of which 32 received tocilizumab. 10 It is not clear what determined the treatment with the antibody, as this was at the discretion of the attending physician. They observed a non-significant lower mortality in tocilizumab-treated patients (16% versus 33% in non-treated patients). In another study, Capra et al. included 85 patients with COVID-9 and respiratory failure and in this series 62 patients received tocilizumab, as soon as the antibody became available. 14 They observed a lower mortality (2 out of 62 patients (3.2%) in the tocilizumab group compared to 11 out of 23 patients (47.8%) in the untreated group. It should be mentioned, however, the untreated group should be considered as historic controls and it cannot be excluded that increasing insights in the optimal treatment of severe COVID-19 may have contributed to the result. Lastly, Morena et al. observed in 51 patients with severe COVID-19 that after initiation of tocilizumab there was a lowering of the body temperature, normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) and a restoration of lymphopenia. 15 In this study side effects of tocilizumab were systematically assessed and the authors found hepatic enzyme elevation in 29%, thrombocytopenia in 14% and bacterial or fungal infections in 27% of patients.These studies (and similar observations in the literature) suggest that tocilizumab may be a promising candidate to improve the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 infections.",
