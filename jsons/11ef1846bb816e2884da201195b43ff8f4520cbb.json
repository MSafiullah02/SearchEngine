These parameters are important for the applications of these nanomaterials in vaccines. [ 1 ] Vaccines represent one of the most effective and least costly means for the prevention and control of human diseases. For certain diseases that have no cure because the pathogen integrates its own genetic material into its host, vaccination may represent the only possible means of the fi ght against these pathogens. One such example is HIV (human immunodefi ciency virus). Human beings, however, have only limited access to effective vaccination. Many serious diseases still have no effective vaccines, for instance, HIV, HCV (hepatitis C virus), lung cancer, and mad cow disease. [2] [3] [4] [5] Nanomaterials have brought new hopes for people with diseases that currently lack effective vaccines. The unique properties of nanomaterials can improve vaccines in a number of ways, including enhancing the immunity of the vaccine, improving biosafety, and optimizing immunization routes. [ 6 ] However, the detailed molecular working mechanisms are still largely unknown, and few studies focus on investigating the relationship between the physiochemical characteristics of nanomaterials and their bio-effects in vivo. Herein, we provide examples of selected studies that show practical applications and working mechanisms of multiple nanomaterials in the fi eld of vaccines. By summarizing six different chemical compositions of nanomaterials-i.e., peptide backbones, carbon, gold, silver, calcium, and polymers-this review shows the diverse biological effects of these materials for regulating immune responses of vaccines based on their various physical characteristics (size, shape, aspect ratio, and so forth) and biochemical modifi cations ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). This review also analyzes how these materials work via targeting and affecting major components in the immune system, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and T and B cells, to shape the eventual profi les of the immunity of vaccines ( Figure 1 ). modify them by covalently linking all kinds of chemical groups or biological markers to their surface. By such artificial operations, peptide nanomaterials can be endowed with more biofunctions for optimizing the immunity of the vaccine. Actually, vaccines composed of either DNA or short peptides, assisted by peptide nanofi bers and/or nanoparticles, have indeed triggered signifi cantly enhanced immune responses in animal models, compared with naked vaccines.

This vector could result in a balanced immune response (strong antibody secretion, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 secreting lymphocyte production, all of which play crucial roles in the preventiion of the infection and controlling the in vivo spread of HIV). It was rarely seen in other adjuvants or delivery systems, and is considered to be crucial for protecting human beings from HIV infection. A comprehensive analysis of the safety of this nanovector showed that it was non-toxic in the long-term study and could completely degrade within 21 days in vivo. Such a property might facilitate its eventual clinical application. The reason for the impressive effi cacy of this nanovector is that this hydrogel can form left-handed nanofi bers which can bind with and package DNA, and doing so allows the DNA to enter host cells [this process was characterized and confi rmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), circular dichroism (CD), and optical microscopy]. [ 6 ] Moreover, such nanomaterials are also convenient for preparation under mild, common laboratory conditions. Such properties further increase the likelihood that this kind of material will be used as the vector for HIV vaccines. More importantly, unlike peptide vaccines which only present linear epitopes to the host, DNA vaccines can eventually express 3D structural proteins in host cells. Nanofi bers may therefore be better for presenting the conformational antigen epitopes. It is crucial to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, which depend on the spatial conformation of the antigen, thus preventing infections from pathogens. [ 41, 42 ] Similarly, an enhanced antibody response induced by peptide-based fi bers was reported by Yan-mei Li's group in the fi eld of cancer therapeutic vaccines. [ 7 ] The sequence of peptide Q11 contains eleven amino acids, which are QQK-FQFQFEQQ (Q, K, F and E respectively mean glutamine, lysine, phenylalanine, and glutamic acid). It can self-assemble into networks of beta-sheet-rich nanofi bers under mild physiological conditions. Because these nanofi bers induce no obvious immunity, negligible tissue responses, and have a large loading capability, they are an ideal vector candidate to enhance the effi cacy of vaccines ( Figure 3 ). Q11-based nanofi bers carrying multiple antigen epitopes could trigger strong IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3, IgM responses, but undetectable IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4 responses, therefore suggesting that the Q11 peptide tends to induce humoral responses via a T-cell independent way. [ 43 ] Q11 can assemble to present clustered T-cell epitopes (an artifi cial peptide that contains only the main antigenic epitopes of the protein) of ovalbumin (OVA, a model antigen) in one nanofi ber to elicit strong antigen-specifi c primary and memory immune responses, which could protect the host from subsequent infection. This Q11 assembly itself could be degraded rapidly and excreted from the injection site to avoid potential infl ammation. [ 44 ] In another study, nanofi bers based on Q11 succeeded in presenting the antigen epitopes and signifi cantly improving antibody responses against malaria. [ 45 ] These studies show that using peptide-based nanofi bers can signifi cantly improve the effi cacy of vaccines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1041, "end": 1046, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1698, "text": "[ 41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1703, "text": "42 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1864, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2611, "text": "[ 43 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3057, "end": 3063, "text": "[ 44 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3217, "end": 3223, "text": "[ 45 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2327, "end": 2337, "text": "( Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Nanofi bers"}, {"text": "These studies employing peptide-based nanofi bers have several common mechanisms of action. Generally speaking, increased antigen uptake would lead to an enhanced immune response. This inference is also well supported by published data that nanofi bers can carry more linear epitopes, or condense DNA antigens into the compact structure, or signifi cantly improve the attachment between host cells and antigens, all of which help to increase the antigen intake of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). [ 6, [46] [47] [48] More interestingly, many important fi ndings have provided some novel explanations for enhancing immune responses to vaccines caused by nanofi bers. Compared with the naked antigens, those packaged by peptide-based nanofi bers could improve the antigen presentation of DCs and macrophages, both of which are crucial antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Moreover, peptidebased nanofi bers can signifi cantly promote the differentiation of T and B cells, [ 49, 50 ] suggesting adjuvant effects of these materials.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "[ 6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 512, "end": 516, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 967, "end": 972, "text": "[ 49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 973, "end": 977, "text": "50 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanofi bers"}, {"text": "Particles are another form of peptide-based nanoscale material.

We herein call them antigen-presenting nanoparticles (APNPs). The second category is the assembly of the antigen itself into nanoparticles (antigen as nanoparticles/ AANPs) ( Figure 4 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 528, "end": 538, "text": "( Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Nanoparticles"}, {"text": "APNPs are usually composed of both a non-antigenic backbone and antigenic epitope peptides, where antigen epitopes are displayed repetitively on the particle surface.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Compared with naked antigens, APNPs can more effectively enter APCs and present antigen epitopes. [ 51, 52 ] An in vivo experiment indicated that APNPs displaying 4E10 and 2F5 epitopes of HIV on their surface (two crucial targets for inducing neutralizing antibodies) induced potent antibody responses against important neutralizing antibody epitopes, which are crucial to prevent HIV infection. [ 53 ] Even for the www.small-journal.com poorly immunogenic antigens (for example, actin), APNPs could induce signifi cant, detectable antigen-specifi c immune responses. [ 54 ] Moreover, APNPs with multiple layers of polypeptides can effectively improve internalization by DCs and promote DC maturation without triggering secretion of infl ammatory cytokines, and eventually induced a potent and balanced cellular and humoral immunity profi le via cross presenting antigen epitopes to both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (two main T-cell subtypes, classifi ed by their surface molecules: either CD8 or CD4). Moreover, epitope peptides carried by peptide-based nanoparticles protected mice from attacks of Listeria Monocytogenes, indicating the superior performance of peptide-based nanoparticles as a vaccine platform. [ 33 ] For mucosal immune responses, jelly peptide reviews particles consisting of a cationic type of cholesteryl-groupbearing pullulan signifi cantly improved adhesion to the nasal epithelium. It thus was more effectively taken up by mucosal cells via the intranasal vaccination pathway. Such nanoparticles also induced effective protection via triggering vigorous neutralizing serum IgG and mucosal IgA in mice. [ 52 ] AANPs can also effectively improve the effi cacy of vaccines. For example, the avian infl uenza antigen M2e, which self-assembled into a tetrameric form of nanoparticle, induced signifi cantly stronger antibody responses than monomeric M2e proteins. Chickens vaccinated with such tetra-M2e also gained protection against the infection of H5N2 (a low pathogenicity avian infl uenza virus). [ 8 ] The dominant epitope in the HRC elements (C-terminal heptad repeat region) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can self-assemble into nanoparticles (the trimmer where the structure of each monomer is coiled) via the GCN4 (a self-assembly peptide) sequence. It induced the highly conformational (3D structured) epitope-specifi c antibody in serum, which showed good neutralization against virus in the infection inhibition assay in vitro.

The peptide-based self-assembled nanoparticle of HPV antigen was also demonstrated to enhance the frequency of CD8 + memory T-subtype cells, decrease tumor growth, and maintain a long-term survival in a mouse model.

This result therefore suggests that the size of the polymer could affect the immune response via controlling the circulation cycle in vivo. [ 57 ] Various sizes of nanobeads (from 20 to 123 nm) carrying antigen epitopes also exhibit different IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 immune responses.

[ 11 ] Moreover, small size (20-200 nm) polystyrene nanoparticles can freely transport to lymph nodes from the injection site. By contrast, large nanoparticles (500-2000 nm) cannot migrate to lymph nodes. [ 12 ] Besides the physical features of nanomaterials like shape and size, chemical or biological surface modifi cations are also excellent options to optimize the bio-effects of nanomaterials. Generally speaking, the antigen uptake by cell is the fi rst step for recognition by the immune system of pathogens. It is crucial for the form of the eventual immune response. The charge quantity on the particle surface can affect the capture of host cells against positively charged nanopolymer particles, suggesting that charge modifi cation is a method for regulating immune response. [ 60 ] CpG is a common vaccine adjuvant. CpG-modifi ed chitosan-based polymer nanoparticles coated with HBV antigen can induce an enhanced IFN-\u03b3 secretion from the spleen in mice, and achieve balanced cellular and humoral responses. [ 13 ] Mild tri-methylation modification on the chitosan surface can signifi cantly optimize the solution of chitosan over a broad pH range, and also improve its bio-adhesive properties. Chitosan as the vector of mucosal vaccines can effectively trigger potent humoral and mucosal immune responses. [ 61 ] Moreover, studies have investigated the release ratio of DNA vaccine encapsulated by chitosan or loaded by PLGA, which is highly related to immune responses. The results indicate that a reasonable modifi cation could regulate release: acidic conditions (pH 2) triggered 50-60% DNA release, whereas basic solutions (pH 10) triggered less release (21-25%). [ 62, 63 ] PLGA surfaces modifi ed with targeting antibodies to DCs or negative charges could effectively improve the antigen uptake and activation of DCs, and induced a stronger immune response. [ 64, 65 ] In most cases, vaccine-specifi c immune responses are infl uenced by factors such as shape, size, and modifi cation of polymeric nanomaterials. Such views have been supported by an increasing number of studies. Among unmodifi ed silica beads with various shapes (spheres, quasi-hemispheres, cylinders, discoids) and diameters (from 700 nm to 3 \u00b5m), only small-and-spherical nanosilica can reduce their accumulation in the organs in non-reticuloendothelial system, and such in vivo distribution is considered a crucial factor affecting vaccine effi cacy. [ 66, 67 ] For nanoparticles based on polypropylene sulfi de (PPS) which is modifi ed with polyhydroxylate, both surface chemistry (polyhydroxylate) and size synergistically contributed to modulate the reaction of a complement cascade. In particular, 25 nm polypropylene particles modifi ed with polyhydroxylate exhibited the best activation for the complement cascade. [ 68 ] A similar phenomenon was also found for carboxylated polystyrene core nanoparticles. Immune responses induced by OVA-conjugated carboxylated nanoparticles are dependent on the size of particle. Nanoparticles 40\u223c50 nm in diameter exhibited optimized effects: bead-linked vaccines can protect mice from developing tumors in two different model challenges (OVA and HPV tumor models), and/or clear those established tumors more rapidly. [ 69 ] In general, non-peptide polymeric nanomaterials as vaccine carriers or immunoregulators are probably closest to clinical application because of their good biological safety and effectiveness in vivo. Typically, PLGA (a kind of polymeric nanomaterial) is one of few drug carriers that has been licensed for use in clinical treatments by the Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) of the US. However, the complex correlations between biological effects and physiochemical characteristics present a major obstacle when using polymeric nanomaterials for vaccines. To exclude the unpredictable hidden dangers, large-scale screening is still the most dependable means to comprehensively evaluate the biological effects of polymeric nanomaterials.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 118, "text": "[ 58 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 325, "end": 331, "text": "[ 59 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 996, "end": 1001, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1062, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1267, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1850, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2083, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2382, "text": "[ 61 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2738, "end": 2743, "text": "[ 62,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2744, "end": 2748, "text": "63 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2934, "end": 2939, "text": "[ 64,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2940, "end": 2944, "text": "65 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3499, "end": 3504, "text": "[ 66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3505, "end": 3509, "text": "67 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3869, "end": 3875, "text": "[ 68 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4309, "end": 4315, "text": "[ 69 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Non-peptide Polymeric Nanomaterials"}, {"text": "This section will discuss vaccines based on zero-dimensional (fullenene and its derivatives), one-dimensional (carbon nanotubes), and two-dimensional (graphene) carbon nanomaterials.

[ 15, 77 ] The conjugation of tumor lysate proteins and MWCNTs improved the cure rate for H22 hepatoma in mice and enhanced the anti-tumor immune response. [ 16 ] Another conjugation involving N-terminus Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) peptide and MWCNTs was able to preserve the correct peptide conformation to generate high levels of antibodies. [ 17 ] Due to their larger surface areas, CNTs were used to absorb T cellstimulating antibodies such as anti-CD3 to induce potent activation of T cells, which can stimulate T cells more effectively than soluble anti-CD3. [ 78 ] Moreover, CNTs linked with CpG exerted increased immunostimulatory activity in vitro. [ 79 ] The conjugation of synthesized tuberculin purifi ed protein derivative (PPD) and carboxylated SWCNTs generated a preferential cellular response in the absence of potential cytotoxic effects in mice. [ 18 ] For some weak immunogens (for example, human tumor antigens), SWCNTs as a carrier could be rapidly internalized into professional antigen-presenting cells within minutes, and induced specifi c IgG responses against the antigen, while the same antigen alone or that mixed with an adjuvant failed to induce a similarly potent response. [ 80 ] Other data indicated that simultaneous immunization with embryonic stem cells (ESC) and MWCNTs could lead to enhanced tumor rejection and signifi cant antitumor responses in mice. [ 81 ] Intrinsic physicochemical properties such as size and length can infl uence the effect of CNTs on regulating the immune responses induced by vaccines. This view was clarifi ed in the experiment of Parra et al., in which complexes of short and thick CNTs, coupled covalently with the azoxystrobin derivative hapten AZc6 and bovine serum albumin (BSA), CNT-BSA-AZc6, produced the best antibody response under all tested conditions, thus proving that the adjuvant capability of CNTs might be dependent on shape and size. [ 82 ] The conjugation method also infl uences the immune effect of the delivered antigens. For instance, the monoconjugate of SWCNTs and the FMDV peptide antigen induced higher antibody titers than their bis-conjugate. [ 77 ] Therefore, with appropriate functionalization method, it is possible to improve the vaccine effi ciency of antigens by using CNTs as carriers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 234, "text": "[ 75 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 403, "end": 409, "text": "[ 76 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 808, "end": 813, "text": "[ 15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "77 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 964, "end": 970, "text": "[ 16 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1181, "text": "[ 17 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1402, "text": "[ 78 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1495, "text": "[ 79 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1701, "text": "[ 18 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2042, "text": "[ 80 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2223, "end": 2229, "text": "[ 81 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2748, "end": 2754, "text": "[ 82 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2968, "end": 2974, "text": "[ 77 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)"}, {"text": "Graphenes are two-dimensional nanomaterials.

They revealed that graphene stimulates the expression of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, as well as chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES. These responses were induced probably by TLR activation and nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent transcription.

By investigating the immune responses of macrophages to different sizes in vitro, researchers found that AuNPs up-regulated expressions of pro-infl ammatory genes IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, and this effect was more potent with small particles (<10 nm). [ 89 ] AuNRs functinalized with carboxyl groups induce expression of pro-infl ammatory mRNA, while amino groups induce expression of anti-infl ammatory mRNA. However, incubation of AuNPs with dendritic cells did not change the phenotype of the cells, while the secretion of cytokines was signifi cantly modifi ed. [ 90 ] Enhanced cellular uptake and cytokine secretion by N9 cells when CpG was modifi ed by the AuNPs were also demonstrated. [ 91 ] The use of gold nanomaterials as vaccine adjuvants has been reported since 2006. Dykman et al. reported that colloidal gold complexed with either haptens or complete antigens could induce highly specifi c antibodies even without using Complete Freund's adjuvant (a common adjuvant made up of inactivated and dried mycobacteria). [ 92 ] The delivering of DNA vaccine by AuNPs with covalently attached low molecular weight chitosans induced an enhanced serum antibody response 10 times more potent than that induced by naked DNA vaccine, as well as potent cellular responses via intramuscular immunization in mice. [ 19 ] FMDV peptide antigen conjugated with AuNPs of different sizes initiated a size-dependent antibody response, with the maximal antibody production in the range of 8-17 nm size of AuNPs. A three-fold increase in the antibody response was observed when 8 nm diameter AuNPs were administered, compared to a pFMDV-keyhole limpet hemocyanin positive control. [ 20 ] Parween et al. investigated the adjuvant effect of AuNPs on a weak immunogen C-terminal 19 kDa fragment of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(19) ). [ 93 ] They found that recombinant PfMSP-1 (19) or PvMSP-1 (19) coated on AuNPs or in alum was poorly immunogenic in mice. However, a strong antibody response was observed when PfMSP-1(19)/PvMSP-1(19)-coated AuNPs were immunized with alum. Therefore, antigen-coated AuNPs with conventional adjuvants may be useful in the development of an alternate adjuvant formulation. Tetanus toxoid (TT)-loaded AuNPs elicited signifi cantly higher mucosal responses following oral administration, while TT alone did not elicit any mucosal response. [ 22 ] Also, the formulation containing small 2014, 10, No. 22, 4505-4520 reviews AuNPs, TT antigen, and immunostimulant Quillaja saponaria (QS, a normal immune stimulator) elicited enhanced immune responses after oral administration in mice.

[ 95 ] Wang et al. conjugated a recombinant protein vaccine targeting human Nogo-66 receptor (hNgR-Fc) to 15 nm AuNPs to develop a therapeutic vaccine for spinal cord injury therapy. They found that the conjugate produced higher titers of anti-NgR antibody than that with Freund's adjuvant, and improved the repair of spinal cord-injured rats. [ 23 ] Yersinia pestis F1-antigen coated on the surface of 15 nm AuNPs generated a greater IgG antibody response in mice compared to F1-antigen alone. [ 24 ] The immune effects of AuNRs have been extensively investigated. The surface chemistry of AuNRs had also strong effects on the activation state of human macrophages. For instance, AuNRs functionalized with carboxyl groups induced expressions of pro-infl ammatory mRNAs, whereas amino group modifi cations induced expressions of anti-infl ammatory mRNA. [ 96 ] Recently, for the fi rst time, we reported that poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC)-and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modifi ed AuNRs can act as adjuvants for HIV DNA vaccine. The two cationic polyelectrolytes PDDAC-and PEI-AuNRs exhibited good transfection capabilities, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)modifi ed AuNRs did not. Both PDDAC-AuNR-Env and PEI-AuNR-Env signifi cantly enhanced cellular and humoral immunity. [ 27 ] They also could promote the maturation of dendritic cells, which might be the mechanism for the adjuvant effects of PDDAC-AuNRs and PEI-AuNRs.

[114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] Considering the release of encapsulated materials in CaP-NPs is mainly related to its pH-dependent solubility, [ 120 ] the pH environment changes from neutral to acidic during cellular uptake processes would dissolve endocytosed CaP-NPs to release encapsulated materials into the cytoplasm. [ 114 ] CaP-NPs therefore can naturally release incorporated contents without any external trigger. Previous studies reported that surface-modifi ed CaP-NPs of 80 nm size could target genes in the liver, protect the inner DNA from external DNase both in vitro and in vivo, and exhibit more effective transfection to mammalian cells.

For example, CaP-NP injection elicited little infl ammation at the site of administration and a little IgE response in animal models, which shows an obvious advantage over the injection of commercial alum compounds. [ 31 ] Moreover, other in vivo experiments have indicated that micrometer-sized CaP aggregates could induce high titers of neutralizing antibody, and showed high protection against viral infection, which is more potent than the aluminium adjuvant.

All of the introduced nanomaterials have good biocompatibility except silver nanoparticles, which exhibit toxicity at high doses due to the released silver ions from the nanoparticles. [ 127 ] Generally, nanomaterials can cause oxidative stress and infl ammation on cells and organisms. [ 128 ] In particular, they can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may cause toxic effects to the cells. [ 129 ] These toxic effects are generally affected by the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the nanomaterial, including size, shape, surface charge, surface modifi cation, chemical composition, degradation, and the formation of a \"protein corona\".

In particular, the bioeffects of peptide-based nanomaterials are mainly infl uenced by the shape characteristics, when they are used as vectors to optimize the effi cacy of vaccines. Fibers are the most common form. Such a structure is very helpful for enhancing the uptake of antigen-presentation cells against their targets loaded on fi bers. Compared with peptide-based nanomaterials, non-peptide polymer and carbon nanomaterials not only possess obviously more possible shapes (ball, tube, stick, sheet, and others) and sizes within the nanoscale scope, but also are easier to chemically or biologically modify (such as adjusting charge and CpG) on the nanomaterial surface. They also therefore exhibit even more varied and complicated functions. Metal materials, such as gold and silver, are convenient to be prepared into various controllable shapes and sizes. By some surface modifi cation, like poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), these materials are endowed with novel immunoregulation effects, including promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, increasing cytokine secretion, and enhancing antibody titers. The antigens encapsulated by calcium-based nanoparticles are not only more effectively taken up by the host, but they also prevent antigens from degradation and damage by the in vivo conditions. Meanwhile, such carriers also can slowly release antigens as a harbor, producing long-term immunostimulation and inducing potent memory immunity. Although the biological effects of other kinds of nanomaterials are not mentioned in this review, their underlying immunregulation actions are still worth deeper investigation. Such studies on uncovering the relationships between physiochemical characteristics and biological effects of nanomaterials would bring us many amazing guidelines for the design of vaccines. At present, in view of the fact that immunoregulation effects of nanomaterials are so far diffi cult to reproducibly predict based on their physicochemical characteristics, large-scale screening is still a necessary means to comprehensively evaluate the biological function of nanomaterials in the next studies. However, compared with some existing methodologies, nanomaterials possess many unique advantages. For example, the conventional vaccine vector, virus-based vector, can express genes of antigens in a high-effi cacy way and trigger potent antigen-specifi c immune responses. However, the applications of these vectors are limited greatly (usually only can be immunized once) because of antivector antibody responses induced by the vectors themselves. Moreover, the complexity of element genes within virus vectors which would modulate immune responses probably brings people some unpredictable consequences. For example, Merck II phage clinical trials of HIV vaccine, in which one kind of adenovirus vector (Adv5) was used as vector, showed a higher infection ratio of HIV in group which received vaccine immunization, suggesting the unsafe aspects of application of virus vectors. [ 142 ] For traditional emulsions or waters which are used as vaccine adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, LPS), their serious side-effects hinder their further applications in clinical trials. [ 143 ] In contrast, nanomaterials hardly induce antibodies against themselves because of their poor immunogenicity. Their small size and appropriate surface functionalization allow them to be excreted easily, therefore ensuring their good biosafety for in vivo applications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3259, "end": 3266, "text": "[ 142 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3446, "end": 3453, "text": "[ 143 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and Outlook"}, {"text": "Of course, there are still some obstacles needing to be overcome for the application of nanomaterials.
