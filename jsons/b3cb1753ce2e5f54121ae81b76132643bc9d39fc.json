Two human RV species have been described: Human rhinovirus (HRV) A and B. Eighteen serotypes and 2 subtypes (HRV 1A and 1B) belong to HRV A. Five serotypes are assigned to HRV B and 82 serotypes are not yet assigned to a species including bovine rhinoviruses (BRV) 1-3. RV are non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral symmetry. The virus is small and has a diameter of approximately 30 nm. Four capsid proteins, VP1-4 have been described. A protomer is composed of one copy of VP1, VP3 and VP0 (a precursor where VP4 and VP2 are covalently linked). Cleavage of VP0 is the final step of the assembly process [3] . One or two copies of VP0 will remain uncleaved; no role for this uncleaved VP0 has been established yet. Five protomers are arranged symmetrically about a fivefold axis, forming a pentamer that represents a corner of the icosahedron. The capsid is formed by 12 pentamers. RV have, similar to human enteroviruses, the same comparatively uneven surface with its characteristic canyon around the fivefold axis [4] . The canyon serves as an attachment site for the cell receptor [5] . In CsCl, RV have a buoyant density of 1.38-1.42 g/ cm 3 . Virions are unstable at a pH below 5-6, a feature, which distinguishes RV from other enteroviruses. However, as they are non-enveloped viruses, RV are stable against detergents and most organic solvents. On the other hand, alcohol and phenol are effective virucidal agents.",

The synthesis of a single virus polyprotein requires post-translational processing to facilitate subsequent steps in viral replication. At least two proteolytic activities are encoded by the virus: 2A pro performs the first cleavage releasing capsid precursors and 3C pro catalyzes most other cleavage reactions.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes observed in children. The infection is usually limited to the upper respiratory tract. It is commonly believed that RV infection increases the risk for subsequent or secondary bacterial infections. In patients predisposed with existing under-lying diseases, like cystic fibrosis or chronic bronchitis, and in immunocompromised patients, elderly and infants, RV can cause serious infections of the lower respiratory tract. RV infection of the lower respiratory tract (LRTI) was demonstrated by Papadopoulos and co-workers [23] using in situ hybridization techniques. These authors demonstrated RV infection not only in epithelial cells but also in underlying submucosal cells. Exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or asthma may be a consequence in these patients [24, 25] . Indeed, approximately 80% of asthma exacerbations in children [26] and about 70% in adults [27] are associated with respiratory virus infections, and the vast majority of these are RV infections [28] . Examination of the early innate immune responses to RV infection in asthmatic bronchial epithelia revealed profound impairment of virus-induced interferon (IFN)-expression leading to impaired apoptotic responses and enhanced RV replication [29] .",

[38] . These models have features similar to those observed in RV infection in humans, including augmentation of allergic airway inflammation, and may be useful in the development of future therapies for colds and asthma exacerbations. Association between common cold symptoms and inflammatory mediators is an important aspect of understanding common cold and RV infection. Although this association seems obvious, the exact mechanisms are less clear and one might expect a better understanding of the detailed mechanism(s) once inhibitors of viral replication are available for studies in humans.

Two other RSV proteins, the NS1 and NS2 proteins are a minor part of the virion [44] . NS1 and NS2 are thought to modulate the host response to RSV infection. The G glycoprotein (~90 kDa) has a peptide backbone with 24-25 side chains and is important for viral attachment to the host cell [52] . A second secretory form of the G protein exists that arises from a second initiation codon in the G ORF. Proteolytic trimming removes additional amino acids, and the final protein lacks the 65 N-terminal residues, including the membrane anchor [44, 52] . The ectodomain of the G protein has a mucin-like structure that differs from attachment proteins of other paramyxovirus. Its function is not clear but it is thought to contribute to virus spread or to prevent trapping by mucus [44] .",

The clinical signs include cough, rhinitis, fever and signs of bronchiolitis like air trapping, wheezing and increased airway resistance. The most prominent clinical symptoms are cough and rhinorrhea, which occur in approximately 90% of primary RSV infections in infants and to some lesser extent in reinfected adults [56] . Fever occurs in 30-40% of both infected infants and adults and otitis media is reported in approximately 20% of infected infants. Ear and sinus pain is reported in 20-30% of infected adults. Symptoms of LRTI, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, wheeze and tracheobronchitis, are observed in 30-40% of infected infants and to some lesser extent in adults, with wheeze and tracheobronchitis being the most prominent disease symptoms. Hospitalization is necessary in approximately 3% of infected children and below 0.1% of infected adults. RSV is the single most important agent in children younger than 3 years of age. Importantly, children with a mild RSV disease have also been reported to have recurrent wheezing for up to 10 years after the primary acute disease [57] .",

In addition, there are several environmental factors (e.g., tobacco use in household, stress, day care) that may influence the course of the disease or severity of symptoms. The role of inflammation and a bias of the host's immune response towards a humoral Th2 response (the typical cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13) are discussed controversially in the literature. A strong inflammatory response does not seem to be determinative for the severity of clinical symptoms [67] , a finding supported by the fact that in many clinical studies patients receiving anti-inflammatory therapy did not significantly benefit from that treatment [68] . However, strong inflammatory responses also have been suggested to enhance the severity of clinical symptoms in RSV disease. The role of inflammatory chemokines in RSV pathogenesis has been supported by many preclinical and clinical studies (reviewed in [44] ). For example, genetic polymorphisms that increase IL-8, a major chemoattractant for neutrophils, and CCR5 expression have been associated with increased RSV disease [69] . A link between an increased ratio of Th2/Th1 immune response (a bias toward the humoral vs the classical cytotoxic response) has been suggested by several authors. This discussion is based on evidence for elevated Th2/Th1 response ratios in clinical studies, the role of key Th2 cytokines in the pathogenesis of asthma and the experience with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine in the 1960s [70] [71] [72] . This vaccine was poorly protective and vaccinated children and infants developed dramatically enhanced disease compared to naive patients upon natural RSV reinfection [48] . Subsequent preclinical studies confirmed a bias toward a Th2-specific CD4 + T cell response in animals treated with formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine vs naturally infected animals [73] . IL-4 and IL-13 support isotype switching to IgE, which is bound to mast cells and eosinophils and, upon antigen contact, induces release of inflammatory mediators like histamine or leukotrienes by these cells. These mediators contribute to the development of the typical clinical symptoms associated with RSV disease.",

Approximately 90% of infants have been infected at least once by 2 years of age [44, 77] . Although RSV is represented by one serotype, a protective immunity against RSV is generally weak and reinfection occurs. Virus-neutralizing antibodies, including secretory IgA found in the respiratory tract, contribute to viral clearance and may play a role in protection against reinfection [54] . However, the IgA response is short [44, 54] . In the lower respiratory tract, the IgG response has been described as more efficient. The role of antibodies as a down-modulator of clinical symptoms has been confirmed by the clinical experience with palivizumab.",

CD13 (human aminopeptidase N, APN), a metalloproteinase located on the surface of epithelial cells, has been identified as the cell receptor for HCoV-229E [180] . A metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) may be the cell receptor for SARS-CoV [181] . Binding of the S protein to the cell receptor induces conformational changes in S that triggers fusogenic activity [182] . The coronavirus genome can only be released into the cytoplasm after fusion of the envelope with the cell membrane which is mediated through the S2 region of the S protein [173, 183] . Replication occurs within the cytoplasm. Early during infection the genomic RNA is released and acts as an mRNA for the translation of the first gene, the polymerase. mRNAs for the other genes are generated subsequently. In general, coronaviruses have several 3' co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs, socalled 'nested set'. The unique part of each mRNA (which is not within the next smaller mRNA) is translated during the replication cycle. At the 5' end of each gene there is a sequence that is common to all genes, the so-called 'transcription-associated sequence', which, as the name implies, is associated with the discontinuous transcription process (reviewed in [171] ). The various mechanisms that have been proposed for the production of subgenomic mRNAs have been reviewed elsewhere [184] .",

This role was confirmed when healthy volunteers were infected with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E and developed classical common cold symptoms [185] . Whereas most infections result in mild disease or are even asymptomatic, additional factors like immunosuppression or coinfections might cause severe disease, even pneumonia [186, 187] . It is not clear whether HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infect the lower respiratory tract in otherwise healthy people, because only URTI was observed in this population. It has been suggested that the lower respiratory tract is more susceptible to HCoV infection in children [187] . Most studies were performed in healthy adults and there is less information about the most susceptible and vulnerable population, children and elderly. However, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 nucleic acid were frequently detected in children with respiratory tract disease (11%) using RT-PCR, whereas in an otherwise healthy control group (asymptomatic bone marrow recipients) only one sample tested positive (0.37%, p < 0.01) [188] . This finding suggests that these coronaviruses cause upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in children that are more severe than in adults. It has been suggested that up to 30% of wheezing episodes in asthmatic children may be due to coronavirus infections [189] .",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae, genus Influenzavirus and include influenza virus types A, B and C. The viruses are enveloped pleomorphic particles with a size ranging from 100 to > 300 nm, their genome is organized on eight (influenza virus A and B) or seven (influenza virus C) negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments [206] . Spikes consist of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The nomenclature for human influenza virus includes type, geographic location of the first isolation, isolate number and year of isolation. In addition, subtypes of influenza A are described by their HA and NA designations. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA types have been described. The viral envelope is also associated with a matrix protein (M) that, after infection, forms a tetrameric ion channel. Several polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, PA) form, together with the nucleoprotein (NP) and the RNA, a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (reviewed in [206] ). Influenza viruses are transmitted via the respiratory route and bind to a cell receptor that consists of oligosaccharides and that is present on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells. The sialic acid-2,6-galactose linkage (SA 2,6Gal) that is associated with binding to human influenza virus HA is present in the human respiratory tract (reviewed in [207] ). After binding, the virus enters the host cell by endocytosis [208] . Further steps include fusion of the virus to the endosome [206] and the release of the RNP into the nucleus through an ion channel that is formed by M2 [209] . The viral RNA is a template for complementary RNA and the mRNA. The nonstructural NEP/NS2 as well as M1 play a role in the nuclear export of novel RNA. Assembly occurs at the apical surface of the cell, budding occurs and the novel virus is released (reviewed in [206] ).",

Influenza B virus, on the other hand, has a restricted host range and circulates predominantly in humans. However, influenza B virus was recently isolated from seals [216] . Different types of HA mediate species-specific binding of the virus [217, 218] . It would be beyond the scope of this book on common cold to review all the recent literature that has been published regarding the epidemiology of influenza viruses. However, one important aspect should be mentioned here. Influenza virus is a changing virus and the repetitive occurrence of the yearly epidemic is supported by 'antigenic drift', an accumulation of point mutations in the viral receptors (HA and NA). The drift is attributed to a low fidelity of the viral RNA polymerase [219] . These new variants then infect a population without pre-existing immunity (reviewed in [206] ). A second process that contributes to the emergence of new influenza variants is called 'antigenic shift'. An antigenic shift may occur during co-infection with other influenza viruses. Such a co-infection may lead to a viral reassortment (an exchange of genome segments between different virus strains) [206] . If this process leads to a new virus strain that is able to effectively spread from individual to individual, a worldwide outbreak, a pandemic, may occur [207] . There have been several pandemics in the past century including the so-called \"Spanish flu\" in 1918/1919, infecting about the half of the world population at that time and killing approximately 20-50 million people [204] . Current pandemic concerns are focused on the highly pathogenic variants of the strain A/H5N1 or H1N1. The epidemiology of influenza has been comprehensively reviewed [220, 221] .",
