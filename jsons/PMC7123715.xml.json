Others assert, on the other hand, that ancillary factors may also contribute to mental health risks. These may include the specific context with which the survivor identifies with the disaster; the emotional and physical distance an individual has from the situation; and the quality and accessibility of the support available (Ibid). Further, there are those who argue that PTSD may be overly estimated; while other, less characterised, symptoms are under-estimated (Bonanno 2010). This dubiousness in the literature has been attributed to the difficulty encountered in assessing psychological consequences sustained in disasters, because of the chaotic nature of the event; and because of the methodological impediments to psychoanalysis (Ibid). To provide a more cohesive portrait of \u2018typical\u2019 mental health illnesses following a disaster, George Bonanno and colleagues (Bonanno 2010) compiled data from high quality research and summarised their findings in five categories.",

            "text": "The first category relates to the severity of mental illness brought on by disaster. It was determined that, although consequences of trauma from disasters may range from grief and PTSD to depression and suicidal tendencies, more extreme presentations of the disease have only been observed in a small number of cases. In adults, this accounts for only 30 % of all subjects studied. In youths, acute symptoms in the initial aftermath tend to be severe; however, chronic symptoms tend to be more similar in the adults, not exceeding 30 %. The second category pertains to differences in psychological outcomes and resilience. It is suggested that some survivors overcome the traumas within two years post-disaster; while the more resilient only experience transient symptoms and recover fairly quickly. The Third refers to the factors relating to outcomes, already alluded to above, and theorises that there is no single predictor of outcome. This is because individuals have different risk factors for mental health illness, as well as varied mechanisms for coping with trauma. The penultimate category specifies the risk to interpersonal and community relationships. It acknowledges that, although some affiliations are made stronger by shared traumatic experiences, several indicators suggest that most relationships actually do not survive the experience. Incidentally, the status of their post-traumatic interpersonal relationships also influences their coping mechanisms. Finally, in examining the mental health effects to populations located at a distance from the disaster scene, it has been determined that transient grief may be experienced by these individuals; however, psychological disorders may only be recognisable in those with prior experience in disasters, including those who lost loved ones under similar circumstances (Bonanno 2010).",

Ascertain whether expanding the scope of these systems will be beneficial and can be implemented rapidly.Use a template that covers all the essential information, and that could easily be updated. This would include what is being done; what is known; what is yet to be determined; and where further information will be provided when they become available.An informed decision needs to be taken on when it would be appropriate to report the number of dead, missing and displaced. Too soon, and the numbers are likely to be grossly inaccurate; too late, and the media could be disposed towards exaggeration.Information on the system of search and rescue, and body retrieval, identification, interment and disposal must be provided.Photographs and other identifying information should only be released to the media if it has been determined that doing so would enhance the identification process.\nThe media\nDesignate a representative with whom the media may liaise.Install an office specific for media relations, preferably as close to the scene as possible.Provide journalists with accurate, confirmable, and up-to-date information as close to real time as practicable, to advance factual reporting and mitigate rumour-mongering. This may be facilitated through regular press briefings or short interviews.Social media is a double-edged sword. Knowledge will be available immediately and in real-time; however, the material will tend to be unedited and prone to bias. If not managed appropriately, it may disrupt fatality plans already in progress.\nThe public\nDetermine the most appropriate method of providing information to different age groups and social, cultural and economic strata, to avoid marginalisation.Circulate concise information on what procedures need to be adhered to, immediately following a disaster.Vigilance in social media trends is essential.\nThe survivors\nImpress upon survivors that help is available. Enumerate what support can and cannot be provided, and where they need to go to receive the specific aid they need.Provide an emergency contact number strictly for the relatives of the missing and the dead.Provide specific information on where relatives need to go and what documents they would need to bring, to facilitate the efficient and expeditious management of enquiries.Specify the process for procuring a death certificate, so that they may be able to make legal and funeral arrangements.\nThe humanitarians\nEnsure that humanitarian and aid agencies are provided with accurate information, particularly in regard to the risks from dead bodies, and that they themselves are sharing accurate information to those at the scene.Relief agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross may be able to help trace missing persons, if given sufficient information.\nThe dead bodies\nStandard pro forma containing basic information should be completed for all bodies.In the absence of an electronic system of data-gathering, hand-written forms may be used. However, extreme care would be needed in writing and in the subsequent transfer onto an electronic format.All manner of original forms must be readily available, should data confirmation be necessary.All items of a personal nature, including photographs, may be included in the database.All information must be accompanied by a chain-of-custody.\n\n",

            "text": "\nDeath surveillanceIn the early stages of a pandemic, scientific intelligence gathered through already established surveillance systems would need to be rapidly apprised of the nature of the virus and the manner of death, through the investigation of the index case. It is recommended that the role of investigator be entrusted to the jurisdictional medical examiner or coroner (ME/c) in two capacities (Hardin 2009):\nLimited jurisdiction over the dead body in cases when:\n(i)Death fits the profile for an emerging disease that needs laboratory confirmation from body fluids and tissues.(ii)Death of a poultry worker from influenza-like illness (ILI).(iii)Death from ILI of family members or contacts of poultry workers.(iv)Death due to recent travel to a country where pandemic flu strain is circulating.(v)First death case in a hospital, requiring tissue samples for virus characterisation.\nUnconditional jurisdiction in cases when:\n(i)There is no listed attending physician.(ii)The deceased is unknown and decedents have not been found.(iii)Sudden deaths and fatalities uncharacteristic of those due to a flu virus.(iv)Death of incarcerated persons.(v)It is essential to public health.\n\nSearch for the missingDeath from pandemic influenza generally occurs at home or in group care facilities. In the event that an exceedingly virulent pandemic strain also kills its victims with haste, more will be unable to seek hospital admissions prior to death (Hardin 2009). This would result in the saturation of capacities of care facilities and emergency services, and the delayed determination of death. The delay would greatly impact the efficient management of dead bodies (Hardin 2009; Morgan 2009; Ralph 2015; Home Office 2006). The plan to manage this surge, at the scene of death and in the community, should include:\nAt the scene (Home Office 2006)\n(i)Procedures to locate the missing and presumed dead.(ii)Numbering and photographing the dead (or body parts for non-intact bodies).(iii)A mechanism for immediate confirmation of death by ME/c.Existing laws may need to broaden the stipulations on who has legal powers to pronounce death.(iv)Record the date, time and place of death, as well as the testifier\u2019s name and contact information, and their affiliated organisation\u2019s name and address.\nIn the community (Hardin 2009)\n(i)Designate a phone number for the missing persons\u2019 hub where inquiries can be made about the well-being of certain individuals.This hub must be interfaced with hospital and healthcare centre systems of admissions and discharges, and with ME/cand death registry logs.(ii)There must be a system for the regular advertisement of the hub number in several mass media formats.(iii)It is essential that the hub\u2019s database be unrestrictedly shared with the police and emergency missing persons\u2019 divisions.\n\nRecovery and transport of bodiesDead body management begins when the remains of the deceased are being recovered (Morgan 2009). Recovery commences immediately after searching of the scene has been completed (Ralph 2015). It could last for days or weeks, but may be protracted in more severe disasters (Morgan 2009). Its priority is the rapid location and retrieval of bodies or body parts, and the deceased\u2019s personal effects. Speed in recovery aids in identifying the dead; reducing the psychological impact on survivors; and diminishing the distress often associated with the image and odour of death (IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009).The recovery scene is often chaotic and uncoordinated because there is an abundance of groups and individuals trying to help, including locals; aid agencies; and military and civilian search and rescue operatives (Morgan 2009). In order that body recovery does not impede the simultaneous assistance offered to survivors, the following should be considered (Hardin 2009; Home Office 2006: Morgan 2009):\nIdentify the strictures resulting from the immediate surge in numbers of dead bodies.A balance is needed between speed of recovery and thorough documentation.Appropriate body recovery procedures:\n(i)Use of photographic equipment and standard documentation materials such as body tags with unique references.Documenting the exact place and date of recovery would augment the identification process.(ii)Impermeable body bags are ideal for recovery, and double-bagging is preferential; however, sheets of any material may be used if nothing else is at hand.Each body part must be collected in separate bags and no attempts must be made to match them at the scene.(iii)Personal items ought not to be separated from the owner, and all documentation must remain with the body.(iv)Establish two teams: one to take bodies to a holding area prior to delivery; the other to deliver them for either immediate identification or temporary storage for subsequent identification.(v)The holding area will have rapid turn-over. Hence, it is best situated within close proximity of the scene; preferably stretched across the inner scene cordon.The holding area is a private and secured space where documents can be cross-checked and evaluated for completeness. At no point must this area be used as a mortuary; a facility for victim identification; or as a temporary storage facility.(vi)Transport can be achieved by using the body bags or sheets with which they are covered, or by trucks and trailers; however under no circumstances must ambulances be used, as the living are best served by them.\nDisaster areas may be hazardous. It is paramount that recovery teams not be exposed to undue risks in performing already stress-filled tasks. Risk assessments are requisite and basic health and safety measures must be in place (Home Office 2006; Morgan 2009).\n(i)Ventilate enclosed spaces before attempting recovery.(ii)At the minimum, protective clothing would include disposable biohazard suits; sturdy boots and durable gloves. Face masks may be provided, if only to alleviate anxiety from odours and from fear of aerosol infections.(iii)Personnel need appropriate training in donning, doffing and decontaminating protective equipment.(iv)A mechanism of hand-washing, disinfection and decontamination should be available.(v)First Aid and emergency treatments will be needed on-site.(vi)The need for vaccination and prophylaxis would have to be evaluated.\n\nTemporary storage and intermentMass fatalities are expected to overwhelm local surge capacities which will invariably result in delays in victim identification. Further identification delays can result from the logistics of assembling a forensics team, which can take weeks; and from natural decomposition. Places in hot climates are especially vulnerable to decomposition, resulting in bodies becoming unrecognisable within 12\u201348 h.To maximise every opportunity of successfully identifying bodies, temporary storage facilities are compulsory. These can be in the form of cold storage or transitory interment (Hardin 2009; IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009; SPHERE 2004). It is imperative that bodies or body parts are stored in the bags or sheets in which they were recovered and that their associated unique identifying tags are written on water-impermeable labels, rather than on the bodies or bags themselves (Ibid).\nCold storage\n(i)Refrigeration from 2 to 4 \u00b0C will slow decomposition for a maximum of 6 months.(ii)Types to consider:\nChilled shipping crates have the capacity to hold approximately 50 bodies.Air-conditioned trucks can store as many as 30 bodies without the need to build shelving units.Refrigerated lockers or warehouses may be used.\n(iii)Storage facilities require:\nA means of controlling temperature and biohazards.A mechanism for containing biohazards.Suitable water supply.Proper lighting.Work and rest areas for staff.A system of communicating with trace and emergency operations.Shelving units that: are capable of carrying several bodies securely; allow for ergonomic shifting of bodies; and can be efficiently decontaminated at a later time.Thorough records of every stored body or body part.\n(iv)Shortage of refrigerated storage at the scene is to be expected. Establish a back-up plan until more coolers become available.(v)Dry ice may be used in the interim\nOverlaying dead bodies with dry ice creates forensic artefacts, and should therefore, be avoided.Instead around small groups of bodies, construct a wall of dry ice approximately 0.5 m in height, and secured with durable plastic sheeting.Ventilate areas where dry ice is in use.\n(vi)The use of ice is impractical and problematic.\nA large inventory is required, particularly in instances when rapid melting occurs.Melted run-offs may pose concerns about diarrheal infections.Appropriate disposal of ice water will complicate management plans.Water may distort bodies and destroy personal properties.\n\nInterment is the burial of bodies underground when there are no other alternatives, and when temporary storage is needed for longer periods.\n(i)Efficient disinterment will be aided by proper grave construction.\nUse a familiar and protected plot of land.Bury bodies individually if at all possible. Otherwise, use trenches.Local practices may dictate how bodies are positioned (e.g.: facing Mecca).Burials should only have one level; be at least 1.5 m in depth; and have parallel spaces 0.4 m in between bodies.Bottoms of graves with less than 5 occupants should be at least 1.2 m away from ground water. This space should be increased to at least 1.5 m if buried in sand, and at least 2 m if many more bodies are interred.Tag each body, and record their positions above the grave. Use of GPS systems will be invaluable.\n(ii)Selecting burial sites\nAssess soil characteristics, height of water table, and available tracts of land.Situate in land acceptable to local communities.Establish in areas easily accessible to mourners.Sites should be at a distance of at least 10 m from developed land, and 200 m from sources of water, depending on local topographical conditions.\n(iii)Unceremonious burial in mass graves does not satisfy any public health interests; is socially unacceptable; and may waste inventory.(iv)Avoid rushed and unmannerly cremations.(v)It is disrespectful to gather the dead using backhoes, diggers, or bulldozers.(vi)SPHERE international standards mandate that:\nBodies are disposed of with dignityCultural and religious practices be honouredPublic Health practices be upheld.\n(vii)Where burial is inconceivable due to frozen tracts of land or lack of solid ground, it may be necessary to store bodies for the duration of a pandemic wave.(viii)Survivors are more likely to spread infectious diseases than dead bodies, except in cases where diarrheal diseases and haemorrhagic fevers are indicated.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C, and diarrhoeal diseases can survive for up to 2 days in dead bodies.HIV may survive for up to 6 days.\n\n\n\n",

Errors in identification cause embarrassment to all involved; distress to the relatives; and difficulties with legal issues (Morgan 2009). Therefore, forensic methods would also need to be employed.

The ME/c determines where the incident morgue is eventually established (Hardin 2009; Home Office 2006; Ralph 2015); it may be that a temporary facility is constructed, or that an already existing structure is expanded to accommodate the surge (Ibid). The benefits and drawbacks of each type of facility would need to be judiciously considered (Ibid).\nThings to consider:\n(i)Determine how soon temporary mortuaries can be commissioned for use, compared to how quickly expanded space in already built mortuaries can be made available in disasters.(ii)Commissioning time will have a direct impact on body recovery, storage, and transport.(iii)Temporary facilities need to be operational as soon as 24 h post-disaster.(iv)The use of previously functional morgues may mean that storage already contain bodies; hence, surge capacity will be unknown until such time as the disaster occurs.(v)The disaster scene will be instrumental in determining the necessity of constructing temporary facilities. Information on the projected number of afflicted; the disposition of the dead; and the estimated time of recovering their remains, all need to be considered.(vi)In the event that a pandemic is caused by a CBRN attack, the mortuary will be fundamental in criminal investigations; hence, standard operating procedures must be such that substantiation does not fail under legal scrutiny.\nMortuaries may comprise of several stations, grouped according to specialities. These may include:\n(i)Admitting area(ii)Photography and videography(iii)Radiography(iv)Personal Effects(v)Anthropology(vi)Forensics(vii)Odontology(viii)Fingerprinting(ix)Pathology(x)Repository(xi)Transport(xii)Embalming\nCategories for a positive identification\n(i)Primary\u2014only one of these is necessary\nFingerprints.Dental.DNA.Unique identifiers such as serial numbered artificial limbs and implants.\n(ii)Secondary\u2014two or three are needed\nPersonal accessories such as jewelry, driver\u2019s licence, or identity card.Bespoke apparel.Tattoos, scars, birthmarks or physical deformities.X-ray detailing limb fracture history or active tumours.Blood and tissue type.\n(iii)Visual\u2014Prudence is vital\nPhotography.Basic description of physical features, such as race; height; and eye and hair colour.Location when found.Clothing when discovered.\n\nAutopsies are not needed to confirm death caused by influenza. However, if they are performed, some guidelines apply:\n(i)In the interests of public health, respiratory tract and tissue samples for laboratory analyses may be collected.(ii)Liaising with public health laboratories on the current guidelines for collecting and transporting influenza specimens will save time and effort.(iii)Next-of-kin will generally need to give permission for the autopsy to be performed in a hospital.(iv)ME/cs do not need permission if the autopsy is within their remit.\nRelease of bodies to relatives\n(i)Release dead bodies only when a definitive identification has been made.(ii)Expedited release may be necessary where cultural or religious customs are indicated.(iii)Some laws stipulate who has the authority to perform this task.(iv)The name and contact details of the claimants need to be collected and filed along with other documents associated with the body.(v)Unidentified bodies, foreign nationals, undocumented migrants, and homeless persons need to be stored or interred for further identification at a later time.(vi)Release of bodies with missing parts may later impede the management of severed body parts. To minimise complications, family members\u2019 wishes regarding future identification of other body parts should be documented. Choices may include:\nTo postpone body release until all body parts have been found.To proceed with the funeral but be apprised of other parts that are later found.To proceed with the funeral and consider the matter closed.\n(vi)A death certificate is provided with the release of the body.\nDeath certificates\n(i)The death certificate is a legal document; hence, the law stipulates the signatory on the certificate.(ii)The document specifies the cause and manner of death; where death occurred; when it was pronounced; and the name and contact details of the signatory.(iii)In pandemics, it is essential that hospitals and care facilities assign this task to specific individuals in order to mitigate chaos.(iv)Funeral directors with policies against collecting bodies unaccompanied by a certificate of death need to allow for flexibility during pandemics.\nThis should be addressed in the planning stages.All stakeholders must be in agreement.\n\n\nFuneral homes and crematory operationsFuneral directors are responsible for the recovery and transport of dead bodies; preservation of the integrity of the chain-of-custody; and assistance in disposal of the remains. Although they are not qualified grief counsellors, they are nonetheless tasked with conversing with individuals on the most discomfiting day of their lives. This therefore, also makes them the best people to facilitate the return of the dead to their bereaved relatives (Homeland 2011).Once a body has been released to the decedents, it is generally their responsibility to contact the funeral director of their choosing, for the transport of bodies to funeral homes and the subsequent burial or cremation, according to their culture or religious beliefs (Hardin 2009; Homeland 2011; IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009; SPHERE 2004).Pandemics could result in funeral homes overseeing 6 months\u2019 worth of dead bodies within a 6\u20138 week period (Hardin 2009; Homeland 2011; IRIN 2012; Morgan 2009). Therefore, it may be prudent for individual funeral homes to plan for employing more trained personnel who can be available on short notice (Ibid).\nTransport of dead bodies\n(i)Funeral directors will be responding to requests from families to transport bodies to funeral homes, and from ME/cs to provide conveyance to mortuaries or storage facilities. Plans for the inclusion of more licensed funeral directors and transport services is therefore essential.(ii)Safeguard lawful body transport by ensuring that funeral home personnel are licensed and trained in recovery and transport, and that their vehicles are approved and registered for carrying dead bodies.\nBurial or Cremation\n(i)Burials are more practicable in disasters, because they enable future identification of persons yet unknown.(ii)It is not good practice to cremate the remains of unidentified bodies.\nThere is no public health benefit in cremating those who die of influenza.Cremation will not allow identification in future.\n(iii)Cremating one body takes 4 h and produces 3 to 6 pounds of ash and partially incinerated body parts; thereby, creating logistical difficulties when the number of bodies rapidly mount.\nThe feasibility of continuous running of furnaces need to be determined, particularly in residential areas.If licensing laws are in place, they may need to be lifted.\n\nEmbalming\n(i)To be performed only when requested by families who would rather not have their dead cremated.(ii)Expediting the process may be necessary.\nDeath registration\n(i)Funeral directors are normally responsible for registering deaths, after receipt of a death certificate.(ii)Funeral directors collect demographic information from family members, prior to registration with a vital statistics office.(iii)Electronic submission of both death certificate and registration would be well-placed during a pandemic.\n\nWaste disposal\nFlush liquid waste per standard practice, without the need for pre-treatment.Consult the jurisdictional wastewater treatment facility before dumping large volumes of liquid waste down the drain.Dispose of solid waste in biohazard containers for subsequent incineration.\n\n",

Regardless of how they may transpire, conflict will invariably come to pass between the fatality management team, and the surviving relatives of the missing and the dead. Conflict is inevitable, because each group contextualises the event from different perspectives; fatality management personnel perceive the event as something that needs immediate oversight, in order that they may mitigate further calamitous consequences; survivors, on the other hand, are more single-minded in their overwhelming desire to determine the circumstances of their missing loved ones (Morgan 2009). However fatality management ultimately eventuates, respect; sympathy; and caring are due the dead and their relatives throughout the event (Ibid).\n",
