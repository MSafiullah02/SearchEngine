It was intended to increase the safety level of vaccination. However, the efficacy of this vaccine is probably not comparable to MLV vaccines. More recombinant vaccines can be expected to appear on the market. Undoubtedly, DNA vaccines will be introduced for some of the canine infectious diseases which may have a similar effect. In most cases in vaccine production, the enhancement of one factor comes at the sacrifice of the other. There is presently a tendency to produce safer products. The question remains whether the safer products sufficiently control disease outbreaks.",

This may be the time for some fine tuning to address lesser problems such as the possible autoimmune responses in some breeds after multiple vaccinations. The question has been raised: \u201cAre we vaccinating too much?\u201d and the answer is probably yes. Limited data are available for the duration of a vaccine-induced immunity against CDV, CPV, and canine adenovirus (CAV) in dogs kept in isolation. Immunity against these diseases lasts for several years and annual revaccinations may be unwarranted. In addition, if reliable and affordable quick tests for levels of maternal antibody were to become available, the multiple puppy vaccinations could be reduced to one or two inoculations. The use of oro/nasal vaccinations could be developed for more products, perhaps combined with newly developed vectors, which may reduce the risk of abnormal reactions after needle inoculations. There will be additional innovations to reduce the risk of vaccination but to maintain the protection of the animals.",

The Pasteur vaccine was predominantly used for human vaccination. Chloroform or ether inactivated virus vaccines for dogs prepared from infected brain suspensions became available in the 1920s (Kelser, 1930). The development of live attenuated rabies virus, vaccines in low egg passage (LEP) and high egg passage (HEP) (Koprowski, 1954) led to effective vaccination of dogs (Tierkel et al., 1953; Sikes, 1975). However, on rare occasions the live attenuated vaccines caused rabies-like disease in dogs. They are no longer available. Greatly improved inactivated virus vaccines prepared from rabies virus grown in diploid cell culture are now commonly used in dogs (Pastoret et al., 1997). Although antigenic differences between virus strains were found by monoclonal antibody, the vaccines cross-protect against different strains (Wiktor and Koprowski, 1980). Most of the inactivated rabies virus vaccines on the market today induce immunity in dogs that lasts for 3 years.",

The first vaccine against CD was made by Puntoni (1923) from formalin inactivated brain tissue from dogs with distemper encephalitis. Inactivated CDV vaccines, which were used earlier this century, have not been able to control the disease and are no longer commercially available in the United States. They include a limited protection against disease and no protection against infection. Another approach was attempted by Laidlaw and Dunkin in the late 1920s (1928) by simultaneous inoculation of virulent virus and antiserum. Results were not satisfactory. Vaccination with the heterotypic measles virus (MV) induces protection from disease but not from infection with CDV (Appel et al., 1984). It has the advantage of inducing partial immunity in pups with maternal antibody (reviewed by Appel and Gillespie, 1972).",

The Rockborn vaccine induces complete immunity in virtually 100% of susceptible dogs. However, products from some companies induce postvaccinal encephalitis (PVE), which has not been seen in 35 years of the original and authentic product from Behringwerke (Hoechst) in Germany. The Onderstepoort strain does not induce PVE, however, the seroconversion rate of this product in general is lower, and its H glycoprotein profile differs from the H protein of field isolates (Harder et al., 1996).",

Besides acute hepatitis, CAV-1 is known to be responsible for other diseases (e.g., encephalopathy, neonatal disease, respiratory disease, chronic hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and ocular lesions) (reviewed by Koptopoulos and Cornwell, 1981). The virus was isolated and production of a MLV vaccine followed after serial passage in dog or swine cells (Cabasso et al., 1954, 1958). The safety of this product was limited; the vaccine induced \u201cblue eyes\u201d in some dogs, was shed in urine, and produced kidney lesions. The CAV-1 vaccine for the control of ICH was replaced in the 1970s by CAV-2 vaccines, which induce protection from ICH virus infection without the undesirable side effects of CAV-1 vaccines (Appel et al., 1975).",

It was found to be antigenically related to CAV-1; however, the tissue tropism of both viruses is entirely different (Appel et al., 1973). The virus was later classified as CAV-2 (Hamelin et al., 1984; Marusyk et al., 1970). The attenuated CAV-2 proved to protect dogs against infection with both CAV-1 and CAV-2 (Appel et al., 1975). Because ML-CAV-2 vaccine is safer than CAV-1 vaccine, the former replaced the latter in the 1970s. Intranasal vaccine is now available in combination with B. bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus to protect dogs from kennel cough. It has the advantage over parenteral injection by inducing immunity in pups with maternal antibody (Appel et al., 1975) and, therefore, only one inoculation is needed.",

Because protection from infection by both agents depends on mucosal immunity with IgA production, the latter protects from infection and disease while the former protects only from disease. In addition, maternal antibody does not interfere with the intranasal application. More recently a ML-CAV-2 component has been added to the intranasal vaccine. CAV-2 is also involved in the kennel cough complex. A genome analysis of virulent and attenuated strains of CPIV was made by Yonezawa (1985).",

Vaccination of dogs should only be recommended in endemic areas and in dogs exposed to ticks. It has been commented that only 5% of seropositive dogs develop clinical lameness that responds well to antibiotic treatment. However, a high percentage of exposed nonlame dogs have a subclinical chronic polyarthritis (Appel et al., 1993) and antibiotic treatment does not entirely eliminate persistent infection (Straubinger et al., 1997a,b).

OspA vaccines for human Lyme disease are in testing stages. (Editor's note: Extensive research attempting to demonstrate infection and disease from B. burgdorferi in cattle, calves, fetuses in utero, and adult pregnant cows by Schultz and others in 1993 showed that cattle are highly resistant to infection and no clinical disease was produced in any aged animal, including young fetuses, when multiple isolates of B. burgdorferi were given at low or high doses.)",

Dogs may recover clinically after antibiotic treatment but may die from kidney failure and uremia several months or years later. The disease is caused by infection with antigenically distinct serovars of Leptospira. The most common serovars isolated from dogs used to be L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. canicola, L. pomona, and L. grippotyphosa. However, in recent years outbreaks of leptospirosis in dogs infected with different serovars have been reported from Canada and Long Island. Raccoons, opossums, deer, rodents, and domestic livestock are reservoirs for most L. serovars with the exception of L. canicola, which is transmitted from dog to dog.",

They are prepared from chemically inactivated whole cells, which make them relatively allergenic. Because immunity after vaccination is highly serovar specific, immunized dogs are not protected from other types that are common in many areas and that may infect dogs. They may also suppress the immune response in young puppies and vaccination of pups less than 9 or 10 weeks of age should not be recommended. In addition, the vaccine-induced immunity in dogs is often less than 6 months, and repeated vaccination in endemic areas would be essential for protection (Broughton and Scarnell, 1985). It would be highly desirable to have specific outer surface (envelope) proteins for the immunization of dogs (Bey and Johnson, 1982) like the OspA vaccine in Lyme disease, another spirochetal disease, to reduce the risk of anaphylactic shock and other vaccine-related disorders. In addition, more serovars should be included in leptospira vaccines that correlate with the serovars in endemic areas.",
