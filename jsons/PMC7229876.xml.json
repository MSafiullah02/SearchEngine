From apparent beginnings in the Far East at the end of 2019, it has spread throughout the globe, causing over 3 million confirmed cases (with a much-higher probable prevalence) and over 200,000 deaths at the time of writing (April 27, 2020). Protective measures (personal and societal) to reduce the impact of the pandemic have impacted greatly on daily life in most parts of the world and have already produced enormous economic consequences for individuals, businesses and countries, with more to come. Uncertainty regarding the duration and geographical spread of the pandemic, the time needed to control it and the future availability of a cure or vaccine makes precise future planning impossible in virtually all aspects of life. We truly are living in \u201cinteresting times\u201d.",

We will have to adapt to a \u201cnew\u201d normality in behaviours and relationships, informed by this experience. In some ways, current protective advice has roots in long-distant learning. During the 1665\u20131666 bubonic plague in England, the inhabitants of the Derbyshire village of Eyam were persuaded by their clergyman, Rev. William Mompesson, to quarantine themselves for 6 months to prevent the disease (which had spread from London to Eyam via fleas trapped in cloth) from spreading further. More than 260 of their population of 700 died, whole families were wiped out, but the disease was contained, failing to reach nearby large populations in Sheffield and Manchester [1].",

Like all involved clinicians, radiologists have had to learn the features of the disease as they apply to our practice, including typical and atypical radiologic findings, appropriate use of imaging techniques (depending on available resources) and a correlation of findings with other clinical and laboratory data [6, 8, 9].",

Nor is this confined to academia. The first large gathering cancelled in Europe was the Geneva Motor Show, scheduled for March 5 to 15, 2020. One of the earliest medical conferences affected was the European Congress of Radiology, which was planned for March 11 to 15, 2020 (and which will now take place in an online-only format from July 15 to 19, 2020). Many other conferences have been similarly affected; no one yet knows when face-to-face conferences can safely resume, and what restrictions may still be necessary when they do.",

Some societies are already attempting this: the American College of Cardiology held its virtual meeting from March 28 to 30, 2020, and the European Society of Radiology and European Association of Urology will hold online conferences in July 2020. Many of the necessary techniques are well established. Recording and streaming of conference sessions for later on-demand viewing has been offered by some societies (including the ESR) for some years. Live webinars are common educational tools (and have been offered by the ESR on COVID-related topics since March 2020). However, a full congress is a more-complex proposition, involving a variety of session types, aimed at diverse types of attendees, with many different forms of interaction between speakers and delegates. Future online (or hybrid) conferences must find or invent new methods of allowing discussions and interactions involving remote participants during all sessions, to create the same sense of community and collective learning that can be felt during successful on-site events. This will not be easy, but making this necessary shift successfully will establish a new standard for what defines medical conference success in the future.",

If scientific societies wish to remain relevant to their members and successful, they must adapt to this new reality. Scientific meetings must change their structure to survive, and successful societies in the future will be those which embraced this new circumstance, and adapted early. Future conferences will be different from those of yore, and we must learn not to judge them by old standards. The mould is broken; the new, online ECR 2020 will be a different meeting, with a different structure and different outcomes. It will be the first, and the best (so far) of a new generation.",
