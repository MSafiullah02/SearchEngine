Recently, MHPs have emerged in multiple fields to capture mutual excitation between dimensions, including high frequency trading [1] , social influence analysis [16] and computational biology [13] . However, these MHPs are limited to a specific scenario where a past arrival can only excite the occurrence of future arrivals, and the corresponding link functions 1 are linear (i.e., linear MHPs). However, in reality, inhibitory arrivals and non-additive aggregation of effects from past arrivals are present in several application domains [10] . For instance, negative feedbacks of online consumers may inhibit others' purchasing behaviours. Consequently, MHPs associated with nonlinear link functions, namely nonlinear MHPs [10] , have been proposed where effects from past events encompass both excitation and inhibition.",

That is, all dimensions follow roughly the same temporal characteristics. Note that a dimension may record actions of a user (e.g., tweet, retweet, comment, share) in social media, behavior of a customer (e.g., purchase, comment, return) in online shopping websites, and so on. In reality, different dimensions may exhibit different temporal characteristics. For example, in Twitter, one individual (i.e., dimension) may be extremely interested in a popular topic and interact with her followers frequently whereas another individual may take little interest in that topic and seldom respond to his followers. In such scenario, the cumulative influence from recent events on the former individual is clearly different from the one on the latter. Hence, homogeneous MHPs are insufficient to capture such diverse temporal characteristics. To address this problem, in this paper we augment MHPs by incorporating heterogeneous link functions, referred to as hybrid MHPs, allowing us to cope with diverse impact of past events on future events in different dimensions.",

The offspring events are triggered by past events, while the immigrants arrive independently and thus do not have a existing parent event. Offsprings are structured into clusters associated with each immigrant event. This is called the branching structure [8] , which is an useful representation of MHPs in various applications. For example, in social influence analysis it can construct the narrative of information diffusion to pave the way for strategies to encourage or limit individual behaviors [14] . Additionally, the branching structure is widely utilized as a strategy in the maximum likelihood estimation of MHPs [16] . Unfortunately, such cluster Poisson process representation can only be applied to linear MHPs due to the mutually exciting assumption. Nonlinear MHPs cover both mutual excitation and mutual inhibition stochastically. Consequently, existing approaches based on the cluster Poisson process representation cannot be adopted to infer the branching structure of hybrid MHPs. In this paper, we infer the branching structure of hybrid MHPs regardless of the shapes of the triggering kernel functions 2 .",

In particular, intCRP has a nested structure -inner intCRP to explore the possible triggering relations among events occurring in one dimension (i.e., event links), and outer intCRP to identify the collection of triggering relations between all events and their parents (if any) across dimensions (i.e., cluster links).

The coefficient \u03b1 ij measures the influence from the j-th dimension to the i-th dimension, allowing mutual excitation (\u03b1 ij > 0) and mutual inhibition (\u03b1 ij < 0). The triggering kernel function \u03c6 ij (t \u2212 t jl ) quantifies the triggering effect from the event t jl (i.e., t jl denotes the l-th arrival occurring in the j-th dimension) to the occurrence rate of the i-th dimension.

This is because events in MHPs occur at different time points, and are nonexchangeable. In addition, in our problem setting the influence that determines the pairwise dependencies between events is not homogeneous within and across different sequences. Intuitively, it is natural to quantify the influence via the triggering kernels in Eq. 2.1. In order to tackle these issues, we present the BRUNCH model, which is based on intensity-driven Chinese restaurant processes (intCRP), a new variant of CRP that allows a number of intensity-driven distributions as priors on triggering relations between events.",

So, beyond the triggering relations obtained from single-sequence intCRP, we need to capture the cross-sequence triggering relations among events. To this end, BRUNCH allows us to identify the possible dependencies among multi-dimensional event sequences in hybrid MHPs. Specifically, it presents a class of prior distributions over branching structure according to intCRP, which has nested structure, inner intCRP and outer intCRP. Briefly, the inner intCRP identifies the possible triggering relations in each sequence independently, which are referred to as event links. Linked events in each sequence form one cluster. Subsequently, outer intCRP captures the potential cross-sequence triggering relations, referred to as cluster links, which connects parent events with children from cross-sequence clusters.",

Hence, we are confined to compare our proposed frameworks to techniques that infer the branching structure of linear MHPs in [12, 17] . In particular, we consider the following strategies for our study. (a) Cluster-L: Based on the alternative representation of the linear Hawkes process in terms of cluster Poisson processes, [12, 17] propose the cluster-based method. As mentioned earlier, BRUNCH is not sensitive to shapes of the triggering kernel functions in hybrid MHPs. Hence, we adopt an exponential kernel function \u03c6 ij (t) = exp(\u2212\u03b2 ij t)(\u03b2 ij > 0) in the experiments (see [9] for the performance associated with other kernel functions). For each dimension, the hyper-parameter \u03b3 is sampled by a uniform distribution U(0, 10). The base intensity \u03bc is set varying over dimensions and is sampled from U(0, \u03b3), then the coefficient \u03b1 ij is sampled from N (0, \u03b3 2 ), and the decay parameter \u03b2 ij has the form of \u03b2 ij = c * \u03b1 ij where c is sampled from U(0, \u03b3). The initial parameters \u0398 1:M = (\u03bc, \u03b1, \u03c6) need satisfy the stability and uniqueness conditions (see details in [9] ). Additionally, we set the time window size to W = 12 h. Inferring Branching Structure. We convert the branching structure to a binary matrix S as mentioned in Sect. 4. Given the estimated links (B,C), we updateS according toB, and then derive the across-dimensional branching structure K fromC before filling in the finalS. Afterwards, comparing the estimated matrixS with the ground truth S, we evaluate the effectiveness for all the aforementioned strategies in terms of F1-Score. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) plot the results. Clearly, our proposed model BRUNCH with MEDIA outperforms the baseline Cluster-L, obtaining higher inference F1-Score. That is, the triggering relations among events (i.e., branching structure of MHPs) identified by the MEDIA approach are more reliable. While applying the same inferring procedure MEDIA, hybrid MHPs (mixing exponential MHPs and linear MHPs) show superior inference performance compared to other alternatives. In particular, MEDIA-H is superior to MEDIA-L and MEDIA-E. This further verifies the justifiability of our proposed hybrid MHPs.",

Figures 3(d) plots the scalability of our algorithms with increasing events on Facebook data. The results are qualitatively similar on Twitter (see [9] ). We run the inference methods on different sizes of datasets (i.e., slice different percentages of events in datasets as input data for BRUNCH). Observe that the average inference time of MEDIA stabilizes with increasing number of events. Since the number of event links and cluster links grows significantly as events increases, we expect the average runtime of MEDIA becomes relatively stable when more than 70% input data are utilized.",
