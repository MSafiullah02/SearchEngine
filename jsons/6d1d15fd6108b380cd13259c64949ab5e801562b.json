Chronic inflammatory disease, embracing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hepatitis, asthma, atherosclerosis, multiple system organ failure (MSOF), etc., is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS originate from activated neutrophils in infections and in immune and autoimmune reactions, from tissue deposits of ferritin, and from futile cycling of cytochrome P450 (CYP) following exposure to persistent chemicals, and may be perpetuated by the actions of complement, cytokines and eicosanoids. Acute inflammation is normally arrested by removal of ROS by tissue glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidant vitamins, A, C and E, all of which are regenerated by NADH and NADPH. Failure of this antioxidant defence system can lead to oxidative stress and to chronic inflammatory disease, including surgical shock and MSOF. The roles of oxidative stress and microcirculatory arrest in promoting MSOF, and of GSH, the antioxidant defence system, and fibronectin in preventing this, are reviewed in the light of recent experimental studies of surgical shock, including fasting, anaesthesia, hepatic ischaemia and reperfusion.",

It involves vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, tissue oedema, lcucocyte migration and activation, leucocyte production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1] and release of lysosomal enzymes, the release of cytokines, and the formation of eicosanoids. Inflammation can progress from an acute, episodic phenomenon to a self-perpetuating chronic condition. The ultimate products of inflammation are ROS, which can have a cascade effect on the process, thereby augmenting and extending the phenomenon ( Figure 1) . Hence, the production of ROS by other mechanisms, e.g. redox cycling, futile cycling by the cytochromes P450 (Figure 2 ), prostanoid biosynthesis, and iron-promoted ROS damage [1] , may similarly augment, or even initiate, inflammation.",

One component after another has been considered to be the critical self-promoting factor that prolongs the protective benefits of acute inflammation into the degenerative, chronic inflammatory disease states, such as RA, IBD, MSOF, etc. These have ranged from infecting micro-organisms [16] to complement [17] , prostanoids [18] , iron complexes [1] , loss of glutathione [19] , or energy (NADPH) to recharge the antioxidant defence mechanism [20] . This present review aspires to update this perplexing problem, and introduces additional new factors, namely the specific oxygen-activating enzymes, the cytochromes P450, which have been shown to be involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue necrosis, surgical shock and MSOF [20] .",

They are formed by one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, and are produced by neutrophils and macrophages for the specific defensive role of microbial destruction, but are formed continuously in other tissues by a variety of metabolic processes, including electron leakage from mitochondrial membranes, transoxygenation in the biosynthesis of the eicosanoids, oxygen activation by the cytochromes P450 in anoxia, the action of xanthine oxidase in anoxia, futile cycling of cytochrome P4502E1, and the redox cycling of quinones and carbon-centred radicals [21] [22] [23] (Figure 3 ). ROS have also been shown to be involved in the activation of carcinogens, the formation of neoantigens [3] , DNA strand cleavage [24] , and the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis [25] . ROS may promote and extend inflammation by chemotactic attraction of neutrophils, and their activation to generate ROS, and by contributing to eicosanoid formation [22] ; ROS also contribute to the regulation of prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis and release during acute haemorrhage [26] . Biological systems are protected from the damaging effects of ROS by the antioxidant defence system (Figure 3 ), a complex integrated array of enzymes, antioxidants and radical scavengers, dependent largely on the intracellular redox buffer, glutathione (GSH), and involving GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase (GPx), phospholipid hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [27] , superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase, the tocopherols (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and retinoids (vitamin A) [27] . B-Carotene and a-toeopherol act synergistically, thereby enhancing the radicaltrapping activity of vitamin E [28] . Retinoids are involved in limiting inflammation, inhibiting neutrophil generation of ROS, but with little effect on the xanthine oxidase system, and have been used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disease [29] . Figure 3 . Oxygen radical toxicity and the antioxidant defence system. ROS are formed by the reduction of molecular oxygen, by radiation, CYP2E1, or cytochrome P450 futile cycling. Antioxidant defence depends largely on radical scavengers, including GSH, tocopherols (vit. E), ascorbate (vit. C), retinoids (vit. A), and on antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, GPX, etc. Chemical defence depends largely on uridine diphosphate glucuronyl (UDPGA) and phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate (PAPS) transferases. Chemicals may also be metabolized to give rise to reactive intermediates, which bind to proteins to give neoantigens, or to DNA to initiate malignancy Haem iron may also generate ROS, and may amplify and prolong the inflammatory reaction [30] . It has been postulated that, in RA, iron is released from accumulated ferritin deposits in inflamed joints, leading to the iron-catalysed production of ROS, and the consequent processes of chronic inflammation [1] .",

Leucocytes possess an array of cell-surface receptors, mediating varying degrees of adhesion to a miscellany of adhesion molecules specific for lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets and endothelial cells, and for fibrinogen, collagen, fibronectin, complement, etc., facilitating chemotaxis, leucocyte migration, leucocyte adhesion and activation [33] . Figure 4 . Role of complement in perpetuating inflammation. The activation of complement by endotoxin, ROS, necrotic tissue, and other inflammatory stimuli, in turn activates neutrophils, which release ROS and lysosomal enzymes, damaging the vascular endothelium. This activates platelets, liberating TXA2, resulting in platelet aggregation, local vasoconstriction and ischaemia, leading to microcirculatory arrest and tissue necrosis. In turn, the necrotic tissue again activates complement, thereby perpetuating this cycle of the inflammatory process. From Reference [35] modified Complement is a cascade system of more than 20 proteins, which is concerned in the amplification of antigen-antibody reactions, and is also a mediator of the inflammatory response [17] . Complement activation markedly decreases liver perfusion, and the hepatic ischaemia associated with trauma and sepsis is probably mediated by complement activation. Complement is also a major determinant of eicosanoid release, eicosanoids acting as intermediate messengers mediating the response to bacteria, endotoxin, etc. [17, 34] . It has been suggested by Schirmer and Fry [35] that complement may be a causative factor in the continuing activation of inflammation; bacteria, endotoxin and other inflammatory stimuli activate complement, which in turn activates neutrophils, releasing ROS and initiating a continuous cycle of inflammatory response [35] (Figure 4 ).",

PGE 2 inhibits neutrophil ROS production, suppresses B lymphocyte activity (antibody response) but enhances T-cell activity (cell-mediated immunity); TXB 2 antagonizes the PGE compounds. TXA 2 induces platelet aggregation; PGI 2 inhibits platelet aggregation and is a vasodilator. The leukotrienes are potent mediators of inflammation; they increase vascular permeability, and endotoxin produces a marked increase in LTE 4 metabolites in the bile. LTB4, increased in rheumatoid synovial exudates, in psoriatic skin lesions, and in IBD, inhibits the leucocyte proliferative response, activates T lymphocytes to secrete interferon (IFN-~,), and induces neutrophil ROS formation and monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity.",

In futile cycling, xenobiotic substrates (e.g. chlorodioxins) activate the P450-oxygen complex, but, because of the conformational difficulty of inserting oxygen into the substrate, oxidation does not occur; instead, superoxide anions are released and ROS generated (Figure 3 ). Many polyhalogenated, and other complex, molecules (e.g. TCDD; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) are known to initiate chronic inflammatory conditions because they: Two families of the cytochromes P450, namely CYP1A and CYP2E, metabolize xenobiotics to products with increased toxicity (reactive intermediates from CYP1A, and carbon-centred radicals plus ROS from CYP2E), and hence are involved in the activation of carcinogens and mutagens, and in the elaboration of immunotoxins and neoantigens [3, 46, 47] (Figure 3) . Classic examples of the latter are the CYP autoantibodies of hepatitis [48] , the endoplasmic reticulum autoantibodies of systemic lupus erythematosus [49] , and the fatal hepatitis of tienilic acid antigens [50] . The CYP enzymes are particularly active in the liver, metabolizing nutrients and xenobiotics present in food; they are also present in most other tissues, including the leucocytes, where their function is as yet unknown [3] . High rates of exposure to toxic chemicals and consequent heavy dependence on the chemical detoxication system, make large demands on the endogenous redox buffer, glutathione (GSH), both for the conjugation/detoxication of epoxide metabolites (potential carcinogens, immunotoxins) and for the reduction of quinone metabolites [51] , thus depleting the GSH available for antioxidant defence and so enhancing the potential for oxidative stress (Figure 3) . Furthermore, depletion of GSH decreases the integrity of lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system, resulting in impairment of T-cell and macrophage immune function, loss of immunocompetence [52] and inhibition of leucocyte differentiation [53] .",

The toxic oil syndrome (TOS) that developed in Spain in 1981 followed the ingestion of fraudulently-marketed illicitly-recovered denatured rapeseed oil [54] [55] [56] [57] . Over 20 000 cases were recorded, with symptoms of fever, rash, gastrointestinal pain, hepatomegaly, pulmonary and neurological disturbances, arthralgia and myalgia; over 300 died and many had persistent scleroderma-like symptoms for a decade or so [54] . Rapeseed oil, long known to be atherogenic due to its content of erucic acid, a natural mono-unsaturated fatty acid, is metabolized only with great difficulty. It results in hepatic peroxisomal proliferation, was associated with atherosclerosis, and was marketed as an industrial lubricant after denaturation by addition of aniline/pyridine and a brown dye to prevent human consumption. Illicit treatment to remove the aniline by steam distillation is thought to have resulted in the production of toxic acyl anilides [58] . Erucic acid is resistant to/~-oxidation and is therefore metabolized by CYP4 and peroxisomal enzymes which are associated with peroxide formation and hepatotoxicity; anilides of fatty acids, which are even more resistant to /~-oxidation, would accumulate, and could manifest immunotoxicity. Although not normally antigenic, fatty acids can be made immunogenic by chemical modification, and antibodies to several common fatty acids have been synthesized [59] .",

Normally, the lipid-soluble a-tocopherol, and the water-soluble ascorbic acid and glutathione, scavenge ROS and other radicals, limiting the oxidative stress and inflammatory response, a-Tocopherol is the primary radical scavenger in biological membranes, and is continuously regenerated at the expense of ascorbate and glutathione oxidation ( Figure 6 ), with the ascorbate and glutathione being continuously regenerated by NADH and NADPH in the presence of the relevant reductases [67, 68] . Hence, the prevention of oxidative stress and progressive inflammation is highly dependent on sufficient provision of energy to regenerate glutathione and other antioxidants, and on adequate dietary provision of a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, sulphur amino acids, selenium, etc. to repair the daily Figure 6 . Antioxidant regeneration systems. Biological oxidants and ROS (represented by X') are reduced directly by the tocopherols. The oxidized tocopheryl chromanoxy radical is cyclically reduced to the tocopherols again by ascorbic acid or GSH. The dehydro-ascorbic acid is cyclically reduced back to ascorbic acid at the expense of GSH or NADH, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced back to GSH by NADPH in the presence of glutathione reductase losses of these vital chemicals and enzymes of the antioxidant defence system [19] . Chain oxidation of intraceUular GSH to GSSG by superoxide-dependent production of H20 2 is precluded by the presence of superoxide dismutase, so that the combination of GSH and SOD constitutes an integral component of cellular antioxidant defence [69] . Glutathione peroxidase (GPX), a selenoenzyme, is involved in protection against H20 2 and other peroxides; hence the dietary need for selenium, deficiencies of which result in Keshan disease, a cardiomyopathy widespread in China [70] . Critical illness is associated with both immunosuppression and glntathione deficiency [52] ; GSH deficiency decreases lymphocyte proliferation and production of turnout necrosis factor. Therapeutic or nutritional intervention to maintain GSH levels may enhance immunocompetenee and improve the ability of patients to combat infection and recover from critical illness [52, 63] .",

Subsequent surgeons considered that blood loss was the major cause of postsurgical fatality, and this led to fluid replacement by saline or blood transfusions. Later still, anaesthetics were believed to interfere with hepatic function, and postmortems on surgical fatalities revealed that hepatic necrosis and renal necrosis were frequent causes of death. Surgical shock is a major cause of death of critically ill and injured patients, particularly.military casualties in time of war and road traffic accidents in peace time. Resuscitation of casualties to normal blood pressure proved to be inadequate, with many patients dying of renal failure, so that urine output became the factor to monitor for successful shock resuscitation in the 1950s. In World War 2, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, often fatal, was a major feature of shock in flying personnel suffering severe burns and shot down in combat. Following the correction of blood volume and renal function, pulmonary dysfunction became the next weak link, and, in the Vietnam war, 'shock lung' or Da Nang lung (acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS) was a major cause of fatalities. In the 1980s, medical technology had advanced to correct the various single organ dysfunctions, and multiple system organ failure (MSOF) emerged as a consequence [14] . Four major organ systems at risk have been identified, namely pulmonary failure, hepatic failure, renal failure and stress gastrointestinal bleeding. ARDS has been associated with massive effort at resuscitation, hepatic failure is associated with anaesthetic and drug toxicities, renal failure with drug toxicity and transfusion reactions, and hypovolaemic shock and uncontrolled infections have both been associated with all four organ failures. In those instances where any of these organ failures were studied in detail, inflammation with nentrophil invasion, ROS production, oxidative stress and eventual tissue necrosis, were characteristic features. Hence, MSOF may be considered to be a form of systemic inflammation, progressing from one organ to another, as modern medical technology is applied to rescue each individual system in the resuscitation of the patient.",

Blood-borne microaggregate debris in association with fibronectin deficiency may lead to leucocyte activation and sequestration, releasing ROS and proteases, resulting in endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, oedema, tissue necrosis and organ failure [71] . In various forms of trauma, including crush injury, fractures and burns, necrotic tissue, fracture fragments and haematoma fragments serve as stimuli for continuing activation of inflammation. In instances of exposure to toxic chemicals activating the cytochromes P450 to give rise to futile cycling or neoantigen formation, numerous pathogenic mediators of inflammation are activated; these include cellular mediators (cytokines) and humoral mediators (complement, ROS, eicosanoids, kinins, etc.). This systemic inflammation is likely to be the primary trigger for widespread microvascular injury, microaggregation of tissue debris, and microcirculatory arrest, ischaemia and organ failure. MSOF is thus the likely consequence of generalized autodestructive systemic inflammation 135] (see Figure 4 ). Organs fail sequentially, rather than simultaneously. The sequence of organ failure is the clinical manifestation of the organ-specific responses to systemic inflammation, microcirculatory arrest, ischaemia, and tissue necrosis. Hepatic and pulmonary failure are the earlier manifestations of MSOF, probably because these tissues, unlike the kidney, are rich in tissue-fixed macrophages which release numerous inflammation-mediating factors, including IL-1, TNFa, PAF, eicosanoids, etc. Renal failure is usually terminal, since in the ultimate oxidative stress, ROS, lipid peroxides, and other toxic products of the ROS-mediated tissue lipid peroxidation, are excreted via the kidney, resulting in fatal damage, as has been reproduced in numerous animal models I72]. Because of the self-promoting nature of the systemic inflammation, removal of the original, initiating stimulus may do little to prevent the propagation of the inflammation, the organ ischaemia and organ failure, and eventual death.",

Hence, it was concluded that both food deprivation and ether anaesthesia result in ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, probably by the induction of CYP2E1, a cytochrome P450 which is known to be highly active in futile cycling and the generation of ROS [75] . Thus, in addition to the generation of ROS by infections and by immune reactions, we now have the possibility of ROS generation from the eytochromes P450 following exposure to certain chemicals. Like microbial infections and immune reactions, the CYP2E1 generation of ROS may also lead to inflammation. In subsequent studies, tissue glutathione (GSH) and total radical-trapping activity (TRAP) (ascorbic acid, tocopherols, retinoids, glutathione, etc.) were determined, together with specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities; these showed that GSH, TRAP, total CYP, CYP1 and CYP2B decreased progressively with increasing exposure to ether, in both liver and kidney, while TBAR and CYP2E progressively increased [76] . This is considered to provide quantitative evidence of the effects of the duration of ether anaesthesia on CYP2E induction, its generation of ROS, tissue lipid peroxidation, and organ necrosis. Although diethyl ether was the anaesthetic used in all these experiments, other volatile anaesthetics, particularly the halogenated anaesthetics, e.g. halothane, enflurane, and other substrates/inducers of CYP2E, are likely to exhibit the same ROS-generating effects.",

Possible mechanisms of ROS-mediated toxicity in surgical shock and MSOF. ROS are generated by cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E), from hepatic ischaemia (hypovolaemic shock) or in reperfusion injury. These deplete tissue GSH and total radical trapping activity (TRAP = vitamins C, E, A and GSH), and also release interleukins (IL-1, IL-6), leukotrienes (LTB4) and PAF. This in turn activates leucocytes and results in oxidative stress, and migrating leucocytes follow the ROS into other organs, resulting in MSOF, ARDS, etc. Liver reduced gluathione (GSH) is expressed as nmol/mg tissue; oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is expressed as nmol GSH equiv/mg tissue; total radical trapping activity (TRAP) is nmol 0 2 uptake per min per mg tissue; thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBAR) is expressed as nmol tetraethoxypropane equiv/mg tissue protein. Six rats per group were studied and mean values are given; SEM values were 20% of the mean values or less. Data is taken from references [19, 20] of hepatic inflammation. After 60 minutes of liver reperfusion, liver oedema was increased by 40%, neutrophil infiltration into the liver was increased 40-fold, TBAR substances were increased 20-fold and were maximal; liver GSH was 95% decreased, TRAP was 90% decreased, and both these were at a minimum [20] . All parameters of hepatic oxidative stress (inflammation) were exacerbated by 24-h starvation; liver GSH closely paralleled the TRAP, and ischaemia alone depleted both by 30% in fed rats and 50% in fasted rats. The oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation were associated more with the period of reperfusion than with the initial ischaemia and more with the later neutrophil infiltration than with the initial ROS generation by the xanthine oxidase system [20[. After 90 rain of liver reperfusion, neutrophil infiltration was observed also in the rat lung, indicating that inflammation of the liver could generate circulating mediators, possibly interleukins (IL-1, IL-6), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and leukotrienes (LTB4) , that provoked sympathetic inflammation in the lungs. Hence, the phenomenon of ARDS following surgical shock or MSOF is explained as a manifestation of systemic inflammation, and possible mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 7 .",

The oxidation of tissue glutathione increased progressively with fasting, anaesthesia, ischaemia, and ischaemia followed by reperfusion (Table 2 ) [20] . A complex series of molecular mechanisms has been advanced to account for the pathogenesis of surgical shock and MSOF, and these include: a) Energy and GSH depletion, b) Induction of CYP2E1 activity by fasting and anaesthesia, c) Generation of ROS, d) Cytokine release, e) Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, f) Neutrophil activation and sequestration, and g) Oxidative stress, cell death and tissue necrosis [19] .",

It is known that loss of GSH from increased ROS formation, and greater demands for chemical detoxication [51] , also has adverse effects on lymphocyte function and immune competence [52, 53, 66] . Thus, high levels of exposure to environmental chemicals may constitute yet another causative mechanism of inflammatory disease; and epidemiology confirms this. Chemically-degraded rapeseed oil in TOS, a manufactured aberrant of tryptophan as the causative agent in EMS, alkyl nitrites and AIDS, anaesthetics in surgical shock, and drug-associated lupus and similar autoimmune diseases, are some of the many examples of inflammatory disease now recognized as being chemically-induced [3, 49, 50] . This may indeed prove an explanation of why, in this age of chemical industry and environmental pollution, inflammatory disease is now most prevalent.",
