The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases. History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases.

COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly in China and globally, with 80 993 confirmed cases and 2761 deaths as of 26 February 2020. COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of international concern, and several Asian and European countries (such as Japan and Italy) are registering increases in the number of infected patients. 8, 9 With the increase in the number of confirmed cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics around the world are having to accommodate a large number of patients. Preliminary diagnosis based on initial clinical features may contribute to disease control and prevention of further infection, especially in areas with limited access to rapid nucleic acid amplification tests. 10 However, in a recent report by Li, COVID-19 patients outside Hubei exhibited relatively mild symptoms, indicating that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is variable. 11 Chest computed tomography (CT) has a high diagnostic value in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients. However, severe lung abnormalities are only apparent on chest CT scans approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms. 12 This poses a challenge for the early diagnosis and intervention in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the ED until a confirmation is obtained through real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain ",

All interviews were performed before an ultimate diagnosis was made. Clinical and laboratory data on admission were obtained from detailed medical records, collected in a standardized case report form by two experienced emergency doctors. Clinical data collected included demographic characteristics, symptoms of infection (such as cough, expectoration, chest pain, and weakness) and presence of comorbidities. Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, interleukin-6 (IL-6) test, creatine kinase test, lactate dehydrogenase test, and tests for the identification of other respiratory pathogens. Chest CT examinations were performed upon ED admission in all patients with suspected disease. Two certified chest radiologists independently reviewed the CT images while blinded to the names and clinical data of the patients. Not all patients presented at the same infection stage and some data were missing; thus, data could not be integrated. ",

Due to the high seasonal incidence of respiratory diseases, these were not atypical manifestations. At the same time, not all patients with suspected disease in our study presented with high temperature when they first visited the ED, despite claims of fever symptoms. This may be attributed to the use of over-thecounter antipyretic drugs. On the 2nd day of clinical quarantine and observation in the ED, febrile symptoms were more accentuated among diagnosed patients, likely due to strict control of antipyretic drugs imposed by physicians, but this observation requires further confirmation. It should also be noted that fever and cough are not present in all confirmed cases, especially outside of Hubei. Similar to previous reports, we found that the initial clinical manifestations tended to be mild in Anhui. 11 There were also diagnosed patients who only presented with myalgia or fatigue, headache, and chest tightness who require additional vigilance from emergency physicians.",

Patients were considered as suspected to have COVID-19 based on symptoms, exposure history, and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. 13 All suspected patients were admitted in quarantined observing rooms in ED. A nucleic acid amplification test was performed on swab specimens from patients with suspected disease at admission. Patients with a positive diagnosis were admitted to the hospital, while patients with a negative initial result were kept in quarantine and underwent a second nucleic acid test after 24 hours; of these, patients with a second negative result on the nucleic acid test were considered to not have an infection and were discharged from the hospital once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antigens on two consecutive tests.

Based on our experience, we recommend strict medical quarantine and observation for all patients with the suspected disease until the results of nucleic acid amplification tests from throat swabs, sputum, and even lung lavage are obtained. 20 In under-resourced regions, where nucleic acid amplification tests are lacking or delayed, strict medical quarantine and observation in the ED or dedicated quarantine facilities (until typical clinical symptoms and CT characteristics emerge) may contribute to disease control and prevention of further infection. The psychological impact of quarantine should also be taken into account by physicians. 21 Our study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective descriptive study with a limited number of patients. Although all suspected patients were enrolled according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Suspected patients not covered by the guidelines or not typical may not be admitted, resulting in a bias. In addition, the patients were only from the Anhui province; it is possible that other initial clinical features related to COVID-19 are observed outside Anhui and Hubei. Second, due to different times from illness onset to admission, and an incomplete collection of data, there was a lack of rigorous grouping and effective statistical analysis. Moreover, the time since illness onset might be shorter than the observation period of 10 days, which could result in biases of clinical observation characteristics. The initial clinical features of patients suspected of having COVID-19 in EDs outside Hubei were relatively mild. Definite exposure history to Hubei or infected patients may not be a requisite for diagnosis. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features. Although we found differences in the initial clinical features of patients eventually confirmed to be infected, those differences were not specific and it seems far-fetched to use them as a basis of early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. For emergency physicians, a combination of epidemiological features, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings may be necessary to confirm the presence of infection. Nevertheless, we recommend strict medical quarantine and observation of all patients with suspected COVID-19 in the ED or dedicated quarantine facilities, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in T A B L E 4 Objective clinical features compare in suspected patients with or without exposure history on admission in emergency departments in AnhuiNote: Data are n(%). *Percentages do not total 100% owing to missing data.",
