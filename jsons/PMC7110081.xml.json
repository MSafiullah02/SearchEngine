The synthetic gene was cloned into pcDNA3.1 Myc/His (Invitrogen) in frame with c-Myc (human proto-oncogene) and 6-histidine (His) epitope tags that enabled detection and purification. A similar approach was used to synthesize a codon-optimized gene encoding full-length S glycoprotein (S1255). Truncated soluble S glycoproteins were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the desired fragments from the vector encoding S1190.

The neutralizing activity of MAbs was measured by use of an assay adapted from the work of Witte et al., as cited in the Office International des Epizooties Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals [15, 16]. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well, in 96-well microtiter plates, on assay day -1 in a volume of 100 \u03bcL. On assay day 0, antibody dilutions were preincubated for 1 h with 100 TCID50 of virus stock (Urbani strain; generously provided by Larry Anderson [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta]). These mixtures of virus and antibody dilutions then were added to cells in replicates of 2 or 3. One additional set of antibody dilutions without virus was included as a control, to detect toxicity. Positive and negative controls (rabbit anti-S1190 and rabbit preimmune serum, respectively) were included in each assay. Virus stock was back titrated in each assay, to ensure that the inoculum was 30\u2013300 TCID50/well. Presence or absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) after 72 h of incubation was determined by microscopy. Neutralizingantibody assays to titer mouse serum were done in a microneutralization assay using 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID50 of SARSCoV in Vero E6 cell monolayers, by use of 4 wells per dilution on a 96-well plate. The presence of viral CPE was read on days 3 and 4. The dilution of serum that completely prevented CPE in 50% of the wells was calculated by means of the Reed- Muench formula [17]. After microscopic visualization of CPE, medium was replaced by PBS, CellTiter96 reagent (Promega) was added, and plates were incubated for 2\u20134 h until gradations of color between uninfected and infected controls were easily distinguished visually. CellTiter96 is metabolized to a soluble, colored product, the concentration of which is proportional to the number of viable cells in the culture. Absorbance is reduced in wells with significant CPE. To inactivate virus, 10% SDS was added, and the absorbance (optical density measured at 490 nm) was read by use of a universal plate reader (EL 800; Bio-Tek Instruments). Percent protective effect was calculated as follows: 100(observed - maximum CPE)/(minimum CPE x maximum CPE), where \u201cmaximum CPE\u201d refers to absorbance in control wells with virus and no MAb and \u201cminimum CPE\u201d refers to absorbance in control wells with no virus and no MAb.",

To measure the neutralizing potency of each MAb, we adapted microtiter assays used by diagnostic laboratories to measure neutralizing antibodies to various animal coronaviruses [15]. The determination of neutralizing activity included a colorimetric readout of metabolically active cells (CellTiter96), as well as the visually observed level of CPE in the microtiter wells. Both MAbs provided a 50% maximal protective effect (colorimetric assay) at concentrations of ~ 1 nmol/L, in repeated assays (representative assay shown in figure 2A). Although neutralization, as measured by cell metabolism, clearly showed protective effects with both MAbs, microscopic inspection of the monolayers showed subtle differences that suggested infection of cells even in the presence of the highest concentrations of MAb 68. Specifically, tiny foci of CPE were observed in nearly every well with a high concentration of MAb 68. In contrast, no CPE was observed in the wells with high concentrations of MAb 201 (figure 2B). In microneutralization assays using a 30-fold higher-concentration virus inoculum (3000 TCID50/well), the cytoprotective effects of the 2 MAbs were again indistinguishable (colorimetric assay), although curves were shifted slightly toward higher MAb concentrations (data not shown). With the higher-concentration virus inoculum, the small foci of CPE seen in the presence of the highest concentration of MAb 68 were more numerous than with the standard-concentration virus inoculum (100 TCID50/well); however, complete protection from CPE was again observed with the highest concentration of MAb 201 (figure 2C).",

Despite these differences in protein recognition, both MAbs protected mice in a model of virus challenge. The mechanism of neutralization for MAb 201, which bound to aa 490\u2013510, is most likely a direct interference of binding of virus S glycoprotein to its receptor, ACE2. Neutralization and protection of mice by MAb 68, which bound to aa 130\u2013150 but failed to block S590 binding to Vero E6 cells, must involve a different mechanism. The simplest explanation would be interference with the conformational changes that are required for virus-cell membrane fusion to occur after binding to ACE2. Additional possible mechanisms include (1) alterations in physical properties of SARSCoV (e.g., aggregation) and (2) interference with an as-yetunrecognized coreceptor.",

Nonetheless, a reasonable hypothesis is that these effects could be achieved, given the results of preclinical and clinical testing of the MAb Palivizumab in the prevention of RSV disease. In animal models of RSV infection, Palivizumab does not prevent infection but significantly reduces virus titers [20].
