To determine the conversion activity, a high amount of recombinant enzyme was incubated with 100 \u03bcM of dThd or 13b and 13c in TP-buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 and 150 mM NaCl) or UP-buffer (same as TP-buffer, but 300 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM).

Deprotection of nucleosides 2a-e in methanolic ammonia gave the fully unprotected derivatives 3a-c,f,g, while the base protected benzoylated derivatives 3d,e were obtained when 2d,e were treated with NaOH-ethanol-pyridine [10], [11], [14]. Treatment of 3a-e with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride in dry pyridine [35] and direct acetylation of the free hydroxyls at C-2\u2032 and C-4\u2032 with acetic anhydride/pyridine afforded the desired acetylated 6-O-tosylated derivatives 4a-e in very good yields. Subsequently, the tosylated derivatives 4a-e, after treatment with potassium thioacetate in hot N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [36], [37], [38], were converted into the corresponding thioacetates, 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)thymine (5a), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)uracil (5b), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)5-fluorouracil (5c), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)-N\n4-benzoyl cytosine (5d) and 9-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)-N\n6-benzoyl adenine (5e), respectively. Deprotection of the \u03b2-protected thionucleosides 5a-e by methanolic ammonia and in situ thiopyridinylation in H2O, MeOH and 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide (DTDP) at room temperature [22], led to the desired derivatives 7a-c. These reactions were completed within 20 h and the isolated yields of the 6-S-nucleosidyl S-pyridine disulfides were generally higher than 65%. Attempts to fully unprotect thionucleosides 5a-c resulted to the formation of their corresponding symmetrical disulfides 6a-c, the thiopyridinylation of which also led to the desired 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7a-c. It is noteworthy that only decomposition products were obtained after deprotection/thiopyridinylation of N\n4-benzoyl cytosine and N\n6-benzoyl adenine derivatives, 5d and 5e, respectively.",

Our alternative synthetic pathway, in which compound 12 was envisioned as an appropriate glycosyl donour for the preparation of the suitable sugar, is described in Scheme 2\n. Initially, selective removal of the 5,6-O-isopropylidene group of starting material 1\n[34] led to the formation of diol 8\n[33]. Selective sulfonylation of 8 with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride in pyridine led to compound 9, which was treated with dihydropyran (DHP) and p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in dry CH2Cl2 in order to give compound 10 in very satisfactory overall yield. Displacement of the tosyl group with the thioacetyl moiety proceeded without difficulties to afford compound 11. Precursor 12 was readily available from glucofuranose 11 through hydrolysis with 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature and direct acetylation. Deprotection of the glycosyl donor 12 using methanolic ammonia, direct thiopyridinylation [22] (8 mol excess of DTDP/MeOH/H2O) followed by acetylation led to the desired thiopyridine sugar 13. In order to prepare not only the target 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7f,g, but the previously synthesized 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c as well, glycosylation reactions with the corresponding purine and pyrimidine bases and the 6-thiopyridine sugar 13 followed by direct deacetylation were employed.",

It must also be mentioned that the desired compounds 5a-e, showed strong infra-red absorptions at 1750 cm\u22121 (OAc) and 1697 cm\u22121 (SAc), while in their 1H NMR spectra prominent 3-proton methyl signals appeared, which were ascribed to the acetylthio moiety and 6-proton methyl peaks, which correspond to the acetoxyl group. Moreover, data in the 1H NMR spectra, obtained for the newly synthesized 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c,f,g, revealed the absence of 6-proton methyl peaks, which correspond to the acetoxyl group and the presence of 2-S-pyridyl moiety, whose proton peaks appeared between 8.4 and 7.1 ppm.",

            "text": "Compounds 6a-c and 7b,c,f,g were evaluated for their antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (strain KOS), HSV-2 (strain G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strains OKA and 07/1, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis in HEL cell cultures, VSV, Coxsackie B4 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HeLa cell cultures, parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and Punta Toro virus in Vero cell cultures, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and B virus in MDCK cell cultures and feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpesvirus in CRFK cell cultures. None of the compounds tested showed an appreciable inhibitory activity at subtoxic concentrations (i.e. 4\u201320 \u03bcM for 7b, 20\u2013100 \u03bcM for 7c and >100 \u03bcM for the other compounds). The new molecules were also examined for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia L1210, murine mammary carcinoma FM3A, human lymphocyte Molt4/C8 and CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Compounds 3a-g (Table 1\n) and the acetyl-substituted 5a-e analogs (data not shown) did not show appreciable antiproliferative activity. Likewise, the 6,6-disulfide glucopyranosyl pyrimidine dinucleoside derivatives 6a-c did not show appreciable cytostatic action against the evaluated tumor cell lines (IC50: 71 to >500 \u03bcM) (Table 1). However, their corresponding 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleosides 7 were endowed with a more pronounced cytostatic activity in cell culture. In particular, the 5-fluorouracil (7c) and especially the uracil (7b) derivative showed considerable cytostatic potency against the murine L1210, and human Molt4/C8, CEM and HeLa cells. Also, 7c and 7b were cytostatic against proliferating human embryonic lung HEL fibroblasts (IC50: 36 \u03bcM and 9.2 \u03bcM, respectively), Crandell feline kidney cells (CRFK) (IC50: 6.2 and 39 \u03bcM) and canine Madin-Darby kidney cells (MDCK) (IC50: 50 \u03bcM and 11 \u03bcM, respectively). Conversely, the adenine (7g) and cytosine (7f) derivatives showed poor, if any cytostatic activity (192 \u2212 >500 \u03bcM) (Table 1). It is somewhat intriguing that among the 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleotides, only the derivatives containing an uracil/5-fluorouracil base were markedly more cytostatic than those, which bear a thymine, cytosine or adenine base. The fluorouracil derivatives proved equally cytostatic against murine and human cells, as well as against leukemia, mammary carcinoma, cervix carcinoma and lymphoma tumor cells. The molecular basis of the antiproliferative activity of the fluorouracil derivatives is currently unknown. When compounds 7b and 7c were exposed to purified recombinant thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) or uridine phosphorylase type I (UPase), they were not hydrolyzed to the free pyrimidine base under conditions where thymidine (exposed to TPase) and uridine (exposed to UPase) were readily converted to thymine and uracil, respectively (data not shown). These findings indicate that these molecules exert their potency via their intact nucleoside moiety (or anabolite derived thereof), rather than a catabolic metabolite (i.e. free 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranose). Also, it is clear from the inactivity of the 3a-g series of compounds that the 2-S-pyridyl group plays an important role, in concert with the uracil base, to express pronounced cytostatic activity. In fact, Decout has recently reported on 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyribonucleoside 3\u2032-disulfides [22] and found that those derivatives, which contain a rather bulky moiety on the disulfide part of the molecule (i.e. nitrophenyl, butyl, hexyl, actyl) were also most cytostatic than others. This is in agreement with the presence of a rather bulky entity on the disulfide in compounds 7b and 7c as well. The exact molecular mechanism of cytostatic activity is currently subjected to further studies. Mutatis mutandis, compounds 7b and 7c could be viewed as potential lead compounds for further modification in order to redesign and synthesize more potent cytostatic agents.",
