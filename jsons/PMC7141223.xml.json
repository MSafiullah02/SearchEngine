In this study, taking into account such uncertainty, we apply a simple and well-known mathematical model for the prediction.

Of course, this kind of long range peak prediction would contain the essential uncertainty due to the possibility of some big changes in the social and natural (climate) situations. Nevertheless, our result suggests that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Japan would not end so quickly. This might be consistent with the WHO\u2019s statement on 6 March 2020 that it is a false hope that COVID-19 will disappear in the summer like the flu [15].",

In addition, in this study, we have obtained the following epidemiological insights:The essential epidemic size, which is characterized by R0, would not be affected by the identification rate p in a realistic parameter range 0.01\u20130.1, in particular, p\u22651.0\u00d710\u22126.The intervention exactly has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak, which would contribute to improve the medical environment utilizing the extra time period.Intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.",
