Rapid diagnosis of hAdV infection is critical for appropriate and timely management. This study reports the design and validation of a sensitive and specific multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of a broad range of hAdV serotypes in respiratory samples. The assay targets the conserved region of the hAdV hexon gene and utilizes hydrolysis probes for the detection of amplified products. The assay was evaluated using retrospectively (n \u00bc 864) and prospectively (n \u00bc 11,451) collected samples from November 2005 to July 2006. Seasonality studies and analysis of outbreaks was conducted over a 2-year period from January 2005 to December 2006 (n \u00bc 33,067 samples). The assay gave a hAdV positive rate of 7.1% (n \u00bc 811) for specimens tested prospectively and was able to detect a broad range of hAdV serotypes with good sensitivity and specificity. A high rate of co-infection was noted (21.7%). Adenovirus infections were more prevalent in the young with a median age of 24 months for positive patients. Sequence analysis of hAdV positives showed that serotype 7 was the most prevalent followed by serotypes 2 and 3. Association of hAdVs with respiratory outbreaks was low at 2.3% (6 of 266 outbreaks tested) and no seasonal variation was observed for hAdV infections during the 2-year study period. This assay can improve the detection of hAdVs in respiratory samples and can be used to provide valuable epidemiological information.",

Species B (types 3, 7, 11, and 16) , and species C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6) are found predominantly in children [Kidd et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2003; Adhikary et al., 2004] . Species B and E (serotype 4) have been reported to cause acute respiratory tract infections in military camps [Erdman et al., 2002; Kolavic-Gray et al., 2002; Echavarria et al., 2003; Heim et al., 2003; Blasiole et al., 2004; Chmielewicz et al., 2005a; Kajon et al., 2007] . Traditionally, diagnosis of hAdV infection utilizes viral culture with serotype determination based on neutralization or haemagglutinin inhibition with typespecific antisera. Direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) methods for the detection of hAdVs are insensitive and viral culture is time consuming [Coyle et al., 2004; Moura et al., 2007] . Sensitive and specific hAdV assays with rapid turn-around are needed as treatment may be considered for hAdV infections in immunocompromised hosts.",

Positive results were confirmed by PCR for 89 of the 91 positives detected by DFA/culture methods (Kappa \u00bc 0.87). Nineteen additional hAdV positive samples were identified by PCR only in this sample set, increasing the positive rate by 3.0%. Two DFA/culture positive samples could not be confirmed by PCR and the likely reasons for this discrepancy are discussed below.

The assay described here targets the hexon gene and shows good analytical sensitivity with a wide linear dynamic range. An improvement in positive rate by 4.2% was noted when compared to DFA and culture in the validation data set. Good concordance was noted between viral culture and this multiplex PCR (with the PCR being more sensitive). During the retrospective study, only two hAdV culture positive samples were not confirmed by NAT, which could be related to the degradation of nucleic acid in stored samples over time.",

The data presented here shows a high hAdV infection rate among children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years which supports previous findings that most children infected with hAdVs are under 2 years of age [Castro-Rodriguez et al., 2006] . Co-infecting viruses were detected in a high proportion of hAdV positive samples; this confirms other similar reports [Coyle et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2006b] . In this study, the higher Ct values for hAdV in samples with mixed infection may indicate ongoing low-level shedding which may not lead to hAdV related disease. The co-infection rate reported here could also be an underestimate as a result of the testing algorithm. No obvious hAdV seasonality was noted during the prospective testing period in Alberta, Canada. In one long term study, no seasonal pattern was reported for hAdV infections over a 10-year period from 1967 to 1977 in North America [Schmitz et al., 1983] . The majority of outbreak samples with detectable hAdV sequences had a low viral load and other co-infecting respiratory viruses were identified. Thus, it is unlikely that hAdV played an important role in the outbreaks reported here.",

Although hAdV serotype 31 is detected with low sensitivity using the PCR conditions reported, this serotype, in addition to hAdV 40 and 41, are commonly isolated only from infants with gastroenteritis [Adrian and Wigand, 1989; Brown, 1990] . Serotypes identified in this study are those most often found in the respiratory tract [Chen et al., 2004; Casas et al., 2005] . Pneumonia in children has been associated with serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 7 [Choi et al., 2006a] , whereas infections in adults are most often caused by serotypes 4 and 7 Moura et al., 2007] . In this study, there was one pediatric fatality associated with a high viral load of hAdV serotype 7 in the respiratory specimen and plasma (data not shown). It has been reported that children suffer more severe clinical manifestations when infected with hAdV serotype 7 having a significantly longer hospital stay [Larranaga et al., 2000; Mitchell et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2006a] . Human adenovirus serotypes 3 and 7 are the two most important etiological agents of pneumonia in China, accounting for 69-100% of the hAdV isolated from patients with pneumonia. The fatality rate reported for infantile pneumonia caused by hAdV serotype 7 was 24%, significantly higher than that for hAdV serotype 3 [Li et al., 1996] . Other studies have reported serotype 7 as the causative agent for severe childhood pneumonia [Choi et al., 2006a ] and a nosocomial outbreak at a paediatric hospital [Gerber et al., 2001] .",

Sequence analysis of amplified products obtained directly from the sample extract show feasibility of this approach for epidemiological studies and individual case analysis.",
