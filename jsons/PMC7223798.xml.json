One mouse developed clinical signs of chronic infection at 37 days post-inoculation, being euthanized for collection of peritoneal liquid and brain tissue. These biological samples were inoculated in MARC-145 cells for parasite growth; however, only in the cell culture inoculated with brain tissue was observed parasites. According with genetic characterization, two atypical genotypes were observed: one matched with ToxoDB genotype #146 and the other one has not been described before (classified now as ToxoDB #279) (Table 2).

Previous studies with free-range chickens form Brazil have described an isolation ranging from 15.12 to 87.87% [20\u201322]. In the present study, isolates was obtained from seropositive animals; however, previous studies have described isolation of the parasite from seronegative animals, including chickens and doves [23, 24]. In the past, T. gondii was considered to be parasite with low degree of genetic diversity [5] with three clonal lineages; however, studies performed later, mainly in South American countries, a higher genetic diversity was observed, with occurrence of many atypical genotypes [6]. The isolates obtained in our study were considered of low to moderate pathogenicity, since no animal showed clinical signs of acute infection; however, since in the mouse bioassay the infectious dose is unknown, additional studies aiming to determine the virulence patterns of these isolates should be performed [25].",

Since Vi\u00e7osa and Fernando de Noronha Island are apart by more than 800 km, we can observe that T. gondii genotypes are spread over the country. Besides the isolate #146, we detected a new genotype, now classified as #279, showing a high genetic diversity of T. gondii in Brazil, as previously observed in different isolates from Brazilian animals [23, 28]. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 shows that the genotypes observed in the present study are not related with any clonal strains, being more related with Brazilian typical strains BrII and BrIII, which have been isolated in different animals in Brazil; these strains have also shown similar patterns of pathogenicity with our isolates, since BrII, and BrIII are considered as intermediate and non-virulent strains, respectively [29].",
