Importantly, seabirds can be long-lived and cross multiple continents within a single annual cycle, thus their exposure to parasites may be greater than other taxa. With changing climatic conditions expected to influence parasite distribution and abundance, understanding current level of infection, transmission pathways and population-level impacts are integral aspects for predicting ecosystem changes, and how climate change will affect seabird species. In particular, a range of micro-and macro-parasites can affect seabird species, and pelicans (Pelecaniformes) and marine seaducks and loons (Anseriformes and Gaviiformes). We found that the seabird orders of Charadriiformes and Procellariiformes were most represented in the parasite-seabird literature. While negative effects were reported in seabirds associated with all the parasite groups, most effects have been studied in adults with less information known about how parasites may affect chicks and fledglings. We found studies most often reported on negative effects in seabird hosts during the breeding season, although this is also the time when most seabird research occurs. Many studies report that external factors such as condition of the host, pollution, and environmental conditions can influence the effects of parasites, thus cumulative effects likely play a large role in how parasites influence seabirds at both the individual and population level. With an increased understanding of parasite-host dynamics it is clear that major environmental changes, often those associated with human activities, can directly or indirectly affect the distribution, abundance, or virulence of parasites and pathogens.

Avian pox is a slow-developing disease, the effects of which vary by species. The most common form of avian pox affects the skin, where the development of warts around featherless regions of birds (face, legs, and feet) is a common occurrence (Tripathy, 1993) . These lesions often disappear with time but can et al. (2009) leave behind scarred and damaged skin. However, in cases where these warts become enlarged and clustered, loss of sight, breathing impairment, and difficulty feeding are common side effects. It is in the case of secondary infections due to a dampened immune system, and the development of scar tissue, where avian pox can contribute to bird mortality (Friend and Franson, 1999; Kane et al., 2012) . Infections are also highest during wet seasons and virus transmission is mostly host-density dependent (van Riper et al., 2002) .

Commonly harvested birds such as Common Eiders and murres have experienced pathogenicity, mortality, and even annual colony collapse due to increased parasitism (Gaston et al., 2002; Gaston and Elliott, 2013; Kristj\u00e1nsson et al., 2016; Lovvorn et al., 2009) . Anthropogenic activities such as overfishing and oceanic pollution are also evolving factors contributing to reduced health in seabirds (Braune et al., 2006; Sydeman et al., 2017) . The long-term impacts of these changes can contribute to increased, additive mortality caused by parasites in seabird colonies. Changing climatic conditions and food availability have also resulted in seabirds being preyed upon by novel predators (Iverson et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2010) . More research on cumulative effects from parasitism, reduced food availability due to anthropogenic activity, and changing predatory interactions is needed to understand the collective impact these factors can have on parasite-host relationships in seabird colonies (Dey et al., 2018; Iverson et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2005) . Understanding these interrelations becomes even more crucial when we consider endemic or na\u00efve species of seabirds that may be experiencing increases in multiple stressors due to changing conditions in their habitats. For example, increasing numbers of non-native species in Hawaii have introduced parasites that have led to mass mortality in native songbirds 35 Parasites of seabirds: A literature survey (van Riper et al., 2002) .

Colonial nesting might indeed yield some benefits to hosts against certain parasites. For example, Douglas et al.
