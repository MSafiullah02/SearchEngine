S determines host range, cell tropism and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection1. S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single chain precursor of about 1,300 amino acids that trimerizes upon folding. It is composed of an amino-terminal S1 subunit, containing the receptor-binding domain, and a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit, driving membrane fusion. Cleavage by furin-like host proteases at the junction between S1 and S2 (S2 cleavage site) occurs during biogenesis for some coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, the prototypical and best-studied coronavirus)1,5. The S1 and S2 subunits remain non-covalently associated in the metastable pre-fusion S trimer. After virion uptake by target cells, a second cleavage is mediated by endo-lysosomal proteases (S2\u2032 cleavage site), allowing fusion activation of coronavirus S proteins6.",

The resulting MHV S ectodomain forms a trimer binding with high-affinity to the soluble mouse CEACAM1a receptor (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). We used state-of-the art cryoEM16 to determine the structure of the MHV S ectodomain trimer at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 1a\u2013c and Extended Data Figs 2 and 3). We fitted the crystal structures of two S1 domains11,13,17 and built de novo the rest of the polypeptide chain using Coot18 and Rosetta19,20 (Fig. 1d\u2013f, Extended Data Figs 2, 3, 4 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The final model includes residues 15 to 1118, with an internal break corresponding to a loop immediately upstream from the S2\u2032 cleavage site (residues 827\u2013863). The region connecting the S1 and S2 subunits (residues 718\u2013754) features weak density that correlates with its accessibility for proteolytic cleavage in vivo. Residues 453\u2013535 were modelled by density-guided homology modelling using Rosetta owing to the poor quality of the density in this region (Extended Data Fig. 3k).",

Additional contacts between the upstream and central helices participate to inter-protomer interactions. Furthermore, the S1 subunits interlock to form a crown around the S2 trimer stabilizing it in the pre-fusion conformation (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 3). This is illustrated by the large surface area buried at the interface between each S1 subunit and the S2 subunits of the three protomers (1,970 \u00c52). Many of these contacts involve the HR1 helices and the fusion peptide region. These polypeptide segments undergo major refolding during the fusogenic conformational changes (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013e), which supports the notion that the S1 subunits maintain the S2 fusion machinery in its metastable state. Substitutions of the conserved alanine 994 by valine in helix \u03b128 or of the conserved leucine 1062 by phenylalanine in the central helix were shown to attenuate fusogenicity21,22. Our structure suggests that the former substitution would strengthen hydrophobic packing against the core \u03b2-sheet (Extended Data Fig. 7b), and that the later substitution could reinforce molecular stapling of the central helices (Extended Data Fig. 7a, c). The expected modification of the energy landscape between pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations would explain the reduction in fusion activity of these mutants21,22.",

In the case of porcine epidemic diarrhoea coronavirus, trypsin processing at the S2\u2032 site can only occur after host cell attachment24. This indicates that receptor binding could allosterically increase the accessibility of the S2\u2032 site, which is located within helix \u03b121. The acidic pH of the endo-lysosomes could also contribute to exposing the S2\u2032 cleavage site for coronaviruses requiring cleavage in this compartment. The fact that helix \u03b121 appears dynamic and is found immediately downstream from a disordered loop suggests that it could undergo considerable \u2018breathing\u2019 motions. Regardless of the mechanism promoting cleavage, the MHV S structure reported here explains the requirement for processing at the S2\u2032 site, as it frees the fusion peptide from the S2 N-terminal region, which is a prerequisite for its insertion ~200 \u00c5 away in the target membrane. The peripheral position of the fusion peptide is similar to what has been observed in the parainfluenza virus 5 F3 and HIV gp41 (ref. 25) prefusion structures (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013c). The notable accessibility of the fusion peptide and its sequence conservation among coronaviruses6,23 suggest that it would be an ideal target for epitope-focused vaccinology initiatives aimed at raising broadly neutralizing antibodies against S glycoproteins (Fig. 4a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 9). Major antigenic determinants (inducing neutralizing antibodies) of MHV and SARS-CoV S proteins overlap with the fusion peptide region and support the suitability of this approach26,27. Antibodies binding to this site will not only hinder insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane, but will also putatively prevent fusogenic conformational changes. This epitope-focused strategy has proven successful to obtain neutralizing antibodies against RSV F28.",

MHV uses the viral membrane distal loops decorating domain A to interact with CEACAM1a (ref. 13), whereas MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV rely on the \u03b2-motif protruding from domain B to bind to DPP4 (ref. 11) or ACE2 (refs 12 and 14), respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013d). The poor sequence conservation of the B domain \u03b2-motif among coronavirus S proteins, its considerable length variation among MHV strains (Extended Data Fig. 9) and our density-guided homology model of this motif indicate structural and functional differences. These structural variations constitute the molecular basis underlying coronavirus species specificity and cell tropism using a single S architectural scaffold.",

These ~500,000 particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification with four classes (using c1 symmetry) starting with our initial model low-pass filtered to 40 \u00c5 resolution. We subsequently used the ~230,000 best particles (selected from the 3D classification) and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) to run Relion 3D auto-refine (c3 symmetry), which led to a reconstruction at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution. We used the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation damage41,42. A second round of 3D classification with 6 classes (c3 symmetry) was performed using the polished particles resulting in the selection of 82,000 particles. A new 3D auto-refine run (c3 symmetry) using the selected 82,000 particles and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) yielded a map at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution following post-processing in RELION. The final map was sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of \u2212220 \u00c52 using Relion post processing. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion43, and Fourier shell correction curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution44. The soft mask used for FSC calculation had a 10 pixel cosine edge fall-off. The overall shape and dimensions of our reconstruction agree with previous data although the HR2 stem connecting to the membrane is not resolved15.",

We initially docked the MHV domain A structure (PDB 3R4D) and used a crystal structure of a bovine coronavirus domain A (PDB 4H14) to model the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and the \u03b1-helix present on the viral membrane proximal side of the galectin-like domain. Next, the MERS-CoV domain B crystal structure (PDB 4KQZ) was also fit into the density, and rebuilt and refined using RosettaCM47. Although we could accurately align the sequences corresponding to the core \u03b2-sheet of the MHV and MERS-CoV B domains, the ~100 residues forming the \u03b2-motif extension (residues 453\u2013535, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV receptor-binding moiety) could not be aligned with confidence. We used RosettaCM to build models of each of the 945 possible disulfide patterns into the density for domain B. For each disulfide arrangement, 50 models were generated, and there was a very clear energy signal for a single such arrangement (Extended Data Fig. 3k). Then, 1,000 models with this disulfide arrangement were sampled, and the lowest energy model (using the Rosetta force field augmented with a fit-to-density score term) was selected. Owing to the poor quality of the reconstruction at the apex of the S trimer, the confidence of the model is lowest for the segment corresponding to residues 453\u2013535, as homology modelling was used to fill in details missing in the map.",

Rosetta de novo successfully identified fragments allowing to anchor the sequence register for domains C and D as well as for helices \u03b121\u2013\u03b125. Given these anchoring positions, RosettaCM47 augmented with a novel density-guided model-growing protocol was able to rebuild domains C and D in full. The final model was refined by applying strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints using Rosetta19. Model refinement was performed using a training map corresponding to one of the two maps generated by the gold-standard refinement procedure in Relion. The second map (testing map) was used only for calculation of the FSC compared to the atomic model and preventing overfitting48. The quality of the final model was analysed with Molprobity49.
