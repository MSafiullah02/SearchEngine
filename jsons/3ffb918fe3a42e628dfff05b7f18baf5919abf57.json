            "text": "T he requirements of early intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and ventilators. Operating rooms and anesthesia machines 1 are being repurposed to care for these critically ill patients. Certain ICU ventilators, such as the Hamilton G5 (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland), permit their control monitor to be detached from the ventilator and extended outside the room on an umbilical electrical cable, which allows \"frequent ventilator adjustments while simultaneously decreasing the risk of exposure to staff.\" 2 Although no studies have examined effects on clinical outcomes, the pragmatic benefits are evident: ICU staff need not be continuously present in the patient's room, nor frequently don and doff scarce personal protective equipment to perform alarm checks and setting changes.",

A is a DB15/ male cable, which communicates with the electronic medical record. B is an HD26/male cable, which carries ventilator signals and data. C is a DB15/female cable, which provides system power. 4 We have added and tested 50-foot Figure 1 (right) shows the remote control and monitoring of the ventilation of a mannequin within an operating room converted for ICU care.
