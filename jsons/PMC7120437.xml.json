            "text": "While the risks of blood transfusion have been extensively characterized, the risks of anemia are poorly understood, especially in critically ill patients. Shander [7] described the consequences of anemia in the critically ill patient and explained the adaptive mechanisms involved. Anemia significantly decreases the O2 carrying capacity of blood. In the normal host, the amount of O2 delivered (DO2) to tissue exceeds resting O2 requirements by a factor of two to fourfold [13, 17]. When the Hb concentration falls below 10 g/dL, several adaptive processes ensure a considerable physiologic reserve that maintains DO2 in spite of major adversity. These adaptive processes include: (1) increased extraction of available O2, (2) increased cardiac output (elevated heart rate and stroke volume as well as decreased peripheral vascular resistance and blood viscosity) [18], (3) redistribution of blood flow from non-vital organs to the heart and brain, at the expense of the splanchnic vascular bed, and (4) a right shift of the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve (leading to decreased O2 affinity and therefore increased O2 release) [13, 14, 18, 19]. All these mechanisms facilitate O2 unloading to tissues. Severe anemia triggers additional adaptive mechanisms, which have limited compensation, such as an increase in cellular O2 extraction. Indeed, this explains why there exists a critical threshold of DO2 below which O2 consumption (VO2) begins to fall and selective vasoconstriction is observed, which favors blood flow to critical organs, namely the brain and heart, and deprives other organs, in particular those irrigated by the splanchnic vascular bed [13].",

Cardiac compensation is limited when anemia is associated with hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction. Disease processes such as sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) affect a number of adaptive mechanisms. In sepsis and MODS there is often a high metabolic rate and increased VO2 that substantially limit the available O2 reserve and may result in a situation where demand is not met if an additional metabolic stress occurs. In addition, these patients may also have impaired left ventricular function [20, 21], and abnormal regulation of vascular tone [22, 23], restricting DO2 and redistribution of blood flow, respectively. Moreover, sepsis and MODS may compound the energy crisis observed in many critically ill patients by causing mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction, decreasing tissue O2 extraction as well as its utilization [14, 18]. Finally, decreased RBC deformability, which can alter microcirculatory function, is also observed with sepsis and MODS.",

            "text": "A number of host characteristics specific to children and infants may also impair their adaptive mechanisms. The energy requirements of young infants are much higher than those of adults [24]. This difference is mostly attributable to growth and implies a greater need for substrates including O2 and nutrients. In addition to increased metabolic demands, there are also major differences in O2 delivery between adults and children in the first years of life. Fetal Hb represents a greater proportion of total Hb during the first few months of life, which can cause a left shift of the Hb saturation curve and thus affect O2 delivery to tissues. Physiologic decrease in Hb concentration is normal in newborns and partially explains the great variability in normal Hb values seen during the first weeks of life. During these weeks, myocardial compliance is decreased, which causes significant impairment in diastolic filling that can limit an increase in stroke volume when needed to maintain O2 delivery. Moreover, the resting heart rate is relatively elevated in newborns (140 \u00b1 20/min) and in infants (130 \u00b1 20/min), which also limits their ability to increase cardiac output via increasing their heart rate. On the other hand, the health status of children prior to PICU entry is usually better than that of adults, which might explain the comparatively low mortality rates seen in PICUs (about 4 %) [25, 26].",

In the critically ill patient, this process may be delayed and the response to usual stimuli may be blunted or absent. Strong stimuli for erythropoietin production, such as tissue hypoxia, acute blood loss and anemia are often present in the critically ill and would be expected to increase erythropoietin production. Yet, paradoxically, erythropoietin plasma levels are often lower than expected in these patients. Several factors may be involved [28]. Certain inflammatory mediators may decrease and even block the production of erythropoietin. More particularly, in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is present in >80 % of PICU patients [29], high interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels can substantially attenuate erythropoietin production [7, 30]. Moreover, the response to erythropoietin is not optimal in patients with systemic inflammation, which could explain why the response to erythropoietin is slow and blunted in critically ill patients [31].",

For example, Marik and Sibbald [35] showed that RBC transfusion may cause gut ischemia among septic adults, even if it increases global DO2.

Conversely, RBCs bind more NO if local cellular VO2 seems adequate, leading to local vasoconstriction. This function is almost immediately disturbed by storage (<3 h) [15, 16, 56, 57], and most SNO-Hb is lost within 2 days of storage [55].

This effect may be related to alterations in lymphocyte reactivity observed after blood transfusion. These immunosuppressive properties of non leukocyte-reduced blood products may trigger (in contrast to the situation described above), maintain or accentuate compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) in the recipients.

The risk of TRIM may disappear if the RBC unit is leukocyte-reduced, the latter defined as less than 5 \u00d7 106 leukocytes per unit [2]. Pre-storage leukocyte-depletion is superior to reduction done by post-storage filtration at the bedside partially because pre-storage leukocyte-reduction is usually done under more rigorously controlled conditions and also because removal of white blood cells prior to storage reduces the time-dependent accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in the supernatant fluid [84\u201389]. Pre-storage leukocyte reduction is systematically undertaken in many countries (United Kingdom, Canada, etc.); in 2009, 28 out of 33 American blood banks (84.8 %) provided universal leukoreduction [90]. However, pre-storage leukoreduction does not prevent the production of all pro-inflammatory mediators detected in RBC units. For example, stored RBCs shed microvesicles in the supernatant. This process is an integral part of the RBC ageing process, is accelerated in stored RBC units and is not altered by pre-storage leukoreduction. These microvesicles (ectosomes) contain lipids that can amplify an inflammatory reaction [39].",

In spite of these concerns, the clinical impact of TRIM is still a matter of considerable debate [34]. Moreover the clinical effects of RBC transfusion on the immunological responses of critically ill children remain to be determined, and it is possible that pre-storage leukocyte reduction decreases or eliminates the risk and/or the severity of TRIM [101\u2013104].

Goal-directed RBC transfusion therapy might be the right clinical approach. There are indeed good data supporting goal-directed therapy and using ScvO2 in unstable patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [143, 144], but the role of RBC transfusion in ScvO2-directed goal therapy is unclear. There are no data supporting the use of other goals in other circumstances. Moreover, there is no consensus on what the best choice for a goal would be (maybe ScvO2 in patients in severe sepsis and/or shock), nor any consensus on what threshold should be used for these goals.",

There have been two randomized clinical trials that evaluated RBC transfusion in severely ill children. The first randomized clinical trial included 106 African children hospitalized for a malarial crisis who had no congenital hemolytic anemia. In these patients with hematocrit levels ranging from 0.12 to 0.17, RBC transfusion did not improve mortality (1/53 vs 2/53) if there was no respiratory or cardiovascular compromise [11].",

            "text": "The second randomized clinical trial, the Transfusion Requirements In Pediatric Intensive Care Units (TRIPICU) study, a large multicenter randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, included only stable or stabilized patients [145]. In this study, children were considered stable or stabilized if their mean arterial pressure was not less than two standard deviations below normal mean for age and if the cardiovascular support (vasopressors, inotropes and fluids) had not been increased for at least 2 h [145]. It must be underlined that in this definition of stable or stabilized patient, the respiratory and neurological status were not taken into account. The basic design of the TRIPICU study was quite simple. All critically ill children who presented a Hb level \u22649.5 g/dL within the first 7 days in the PICU were considered eligible for the study; they were included if they were hemodynamically stable and had no exclusion criteria. Children were randomized either to receive a transfusion only if the Hb was \u22649.5 g/dL (liberal group) or to receive a transfusion only if their Hb concentration was \u22647 g/dL (restrictive group). In the liberal group (320 patients), transfusion aimed for a post-transfusion Hb level of 11\u201312 g/dL while the aim was 8.5\u20139.5 g/dL in the restrictive strategic group (317 patients). Only pre-storage leukocyte-reduced packed RBC unit were used. The primary outcome measure was new/progressive MODS and death; all deaths were considered cases of progressive MODS. The number of new/progressive MODS in the restrictive and liberal groups where respectively 38 and 39. The 28-day of mortality was 14 in both groups. These results suggest that a threshold Hb of 7 g/dL can be safely applied to stable critically ill children. Accordingly, the principal recommendation of the TRIPICU study was to adopt \u201ca restrictive transfusion strategy in PICU patients whose condition is stable in the ICU\u201d. One may challenge this recommendation and argue that some patient populations can differ from those in TRIPICU and require more RBC transfusions because they are sicker. Although not hard evidence, subgroup analyses have thus far found no justification to give more RBC transfusion to stable critically ill children even if their PRISM score is higher [145], if patients present with a septic states (sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock) [146], or if they are in PICU after undergoing a non-cardiac surgery [147]. A before-after study also suggested that a restrictive policy is safe in burn children [148].",

The Hb level observed while a patient is actively and acutely bleeding does not immediately reflect the volume of blood that has been lost; thus, the Hb concentration is not the best marker to guide transfusion on an emergency basis in such patients. There is no consensus on what must be done in patients who are unstable, but are not actively or acutely bleeding, like critically ill patients with uncontrolled septic shock or uncontrolled intracranial hypertension. Intensivists believe that a higher threshold Hb concentration is required in unstable patients [136, 149]. Few hard data support this point of view, other than two randomized clinical trials conducted in adults with severe sepsis or septic shock by Rivers et al. [143] and in children by de Oliveira et al. [144] These trials suggest that intensivists should try to maintain the ScvO2 over 70 % and that RBC transfusion is required if fluid challenge (up to 80 mL kg within 6 h) and inotropes or vasopressors do not succeed in increasing the ScvO2 above 70 %.",

Limiting and consolidating blood tests, closed blood sampling, use of pediatric blood collection tubes, and micro-analysis techniques requiring small sample volumes (<0.5 mL) can all be very effective ways to minimize blood loss [160, 161]. The concept of bloodless medicine refers to all the strategies that can be used to provide medical care without allogeneic blood transfusion.

It is obvious that more research must be undertaken to provide scientific data before one can establish evidence-based guidelines. Meanwhile, decisions related to transfusion should be driven by physiological need rather than a specific Hb trigger, a decision making process advocated by the National Institutes of Health [162], the American College of Physicians [48] and a group of Canadian experts [163]. Because markers of \u201cphysiological needs\u201d are not characterized in critically ill patients, the Hb level is still pivotal to the decision making process of intensivists who are considering RBC transfusion [1, 136, 137, 164]. In practice, we recommend the following strategy for hemodynamically stable critically ill children without cyanotic heart disease [165]:Blood gas machines should not be used for Hb estimation on which to base a transfusion request.RBC transfusion is required in most instances if the Hb concentration is <5 g/dL.RBC transfusion is probably useful if the Hb concentration is between 5 and 7 g/dL.For Hb levels ranging from 7 to 9.5 g/dL, there appears to be no overall benefit in transfusing RBCs.No RBC transfusion is required if the Hb concentration is >9.5 g/dL.\n",

Rivers et al. [143] in adults and de Oliveira et al. [144] in children showed that aggressive and early (first 6 h) goal-driven protocol therapy directed at attaining a ScvO2 greater than 70 mmHg (equivalent to 65 mmHg for mixed venous saturation) [166] improves outcome in patients with severe sepsis. In the majority of patients, such early-goal therapy was achieved only if the hematocrit was kept above 0.30 during these six \u201cgolden\u201d hours. The recommendations detailed above this paragraph apply after these golden hours, once the patient is stabilized.

Whole blood can be reconstituted by combining one unit of packed RBC with a compatible unit of fresh frozen plasma [84]. Worldwide, most blood suppliers do not routinely provide whole blood. However, the transfusion of whole blood could be considered in the following four situations: (1) hemorrhagic shock; (2) exchange transfusion in a newborn; (3) administration of an autologous unit (i.e. blood collected from the patient a few days or weeks prior to re-infusion at the time of elective surgery); (4) administration of blood donated by a family member and dedicated to a given patient. Some investigators have claimed that the use of fresh whole blood is associated with less post-operative blood loss [177]. Whole blood less than 48 h old is systematically used in some hospitals for cardiac surgery, mostly to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit [152]. However a randomized clinical trial has shown that \u201cthe use of fresh whole blood for cardiopulmonary bypass priming has no advantage over the use of a combination of packed red cells and fresh-frozen plasma during surgery for congenital heart disease\u201d [178].

The volume of washed RBC units depends on the hematocrit. It generally takes 2 or 3 h to complete the washing process and these units must be used within 24 h after entering the unit to begin washing, unless processed with newly available equipment that maintains a close system and thus allows longer (7\u201314 days) storage post-washing. Washed RBC units can be used to prevent transfusion reactions in patients who have presented severe or recurrent allergic reactions. Some practitioners use washed RBC units because they believe they are free of potassium. However, strong hemolysis is observed in washed RBC units; the concentration of potassium units increased rapidly after they are washed, and get to the pre-washed potassium concentration within 24 h [179].",

Nevertheless ABO incompatible platelets (i.e. platelets with A and/or B antigens given to a donor with a corresponding antibody) are usually clinically effective. However there are several reports of acute intravascular hemolysis following the transfusion of platelet concentrates containing ABO antibodies incompatible with the recipient\u2019s RBC [203, 204]. Therefore ABO-matched platelets should be used in pediatric patients especially for neonates and small children where the volume of plasma may be relatively large with respect to the patient\u2019s total blood volume. If ABO-matched platelets are not available, units with plasma compatible with the recipient\u2019s RBCs should be chosen. If this is also not possible, units with low titers of anti-A or anti-B should be selected or alternatively the plasma can be removed from the platelet concentrate (i.e. use a volume reduced platelet concentrate) [2]. Platelets do not carry Rh antigen, but concentrates contain RBCs in numbers sufficient to sensitize the recipient. An anti-D vaccine (Win Rho SDR\u00ae) should be given if the recipient is a Rh\u2212 woman of childbearing potential and the donor is Rh+ [2]. Each 120 mcg of Rh-immunoglobulin covers 12 mL whole blood (6 mL RBC) and lasts approximately 21 days [205]. Tobian et al. [206] reported that the incidence of allergic transfusion reactions to unmanipulated apheresis platelets is 5.5 %, and that concentrating and washing reduced this incidence to 0.5 %. Recipients of HLA-matched platelets should receive irradiated platelets in order to prevent graft versus host disease.",

A TRALI is an acute lung injury (ALI) that appears during or within 6 h after the end of a transfusion. A panel of experts created a list of diagnostic criteria of TRALI that is detailed in Table 19.4. The criterion of \u201cno pre-existing ALI before transfusion\u201d means that TRALI cannot be diagnosed when an ALI is already present. Clinically, TRALI resembles ARDS and involves respiratory symptoms such as hypoxemia, dyspnea and frothy sputum as well as hypotension, tachycardia and fever [216]. Chest radiograph findings are also similar to those seen in ARDS and show generalized opacities. In 90 % of cases, the reaction appears within 1\u20132 h after a transfusion is started. HLA antibodies and/or granulocyte antibodies are positive in 65\u201383 % of tested donors [216, 219]. Respiratory symptoms usually disappear within 48\u201396 h, which is different from the progression typically seen in ARDS [220]. All blood products containing some plasma can cause a TRALI, but frozen plasma (50 %) and packed RBC units (31 %) are more frequently involved than platelet concentrates (17 %) [216].\n",

The most popular hypotheses include: (1) a reaction between donor antibodies (anti-granulocyte, anti-HLA class I or II) and recipient antigens that initiates an inflammatory reaction in the lungs; (2) the neutrophils of a recipient primed by surgery, trauma or an infection overreact when exposed to inflammatory activators (anti-leukocyte, biologically active lipids, etc.) that are either present in the donor\u2019s blood or that were produced during storage [225, 226]. Recent studies suggest that the two theories might be somewhat linked [227]. This has lead to the development of a unifying model (the threshold model) by Bux et al. [228] According to this model, the level of priming of neutrophils, either directly or through activation of the pulmonary endothelium, by a patient clinical condition and by substances (including antibodies) present in the transfused component, is responsible for triggering TRALI in a recipient.",

In most instances, these reactions seem to be caused by a bradykinin modulated metabolic reaction elicited when the blood product is exposed to a negatively charged surface like a transfusion filter. Patients receiving angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors as well as patients with an abnormal bradykinin catabolism, a common occurrence in cases of sepsis, are also at risk [197]. Hypotensive reactions usually appear quite soon after the transfusion is initiated and in most instances, there is no fever, although some flushing has been described. These reactions are more frequent after transfusion of platelet concentrates [238]. Pre-storage leukocyte reduction seems to decrease their incidence, although it does not eliminate them entirely [239]. Close monitoring of all patients receiving angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors is required.",

            "text": "Fever is the most frequent reaction to a blood product transfusion. It is not dangerous unless it is caused by a hemolytic reaction or a bacterial contamination. Its frequency after transfusion of a packed RBC unit is about 1 % [163, 240] and can be as high as 10 % after transfusion of platelet concentrates [241]. A febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is defined as a de novo rise in temperature equal to or greater than 1 \u00b0C that cannot be explained by the patient\u2019s clinical condition (i.e. other causes of fever must be ruled out). The fever can be accompanied by dyspnea, tachycardia, headache, anxiety, rigors (shivering) as well as nausea and vomiting [220]. These symptoms usually appear at the end or just after the end of transfusion. FNHTR is thought to be caused primarily by two mechanisms involving white blood cells. Firstly, FNHTR may occur when HLA antibodies present in a recipient react with donor white blood cells present in a RBC or platelet component. This leads to complement activation and cytokine release, which results in the typical symptoms of a FNHTR. Alternately (and likely more commonly, at least in the case of platelet transfusions) cytokines are released from white blood cells during the storage of blood components; when transfused, these cytokines can lead to a FNHTR in the recipient. The proportion of patients with fever episodes decreased from 24.7 % prior to the introduction of the pre-storage leukoreduction program to 22.5 % following its implementation in Canada (OR 0.88; 95 % CI 0.82\u20130.95; p = 0.001) [242]. It may be useful to use washed blood products for patients with a history of repeated and severe FNHTR to leukocyte-reduced blood products. Acetaminophen can be used to minimize fever, but premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine or steroids is not helpful [243, 244].",

Acute hemolytic reactions are rare (1/26,914 according to MacDonald et al. [207]), but may be fatal. The destruction of RBCs in the recipient is attributed to immunological incompatibility (donor RBC antigens reacting with recipient antibodies). Acute hemolytic reactions are usually caused by the transfusion of an incompatible blood product, an adverse event that is attributable to error in 86 % of cases. Acute hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility is the leading cause of severe reaction to RBC transfusion (1/108,968 RBC transfusions) [207]; however, other erythrocyte antigens can be involved (D/d, C/c, E/e, Kell, etc.). Hemolysis is associated with hemoglobinuria and acute anemia. Fever is also frequent, as well as shivering, discomfort and general pain. In severe cases, hypotension, shock, renal insufficiency and DIC can be observed. A mortality rate as high as 10 % is reported [197]. In order to prevent such hemolytic reactions, correct labeling of the blood sample for pre-transfusion testing is essential and, at the time of transfusion, compatibility between donor and recipient including ABO and Rh groups, the identification number of the unit as well as the identity of the recipient (name and hospital chart number) must be meticulously verified and routinely double-checked at the patient\u2019s bedside.",

The risk for severe allergic reactions is greater in patients with IgA antibodies associated with IgA deficiency. Severe reactions usually occur more rapidly than mild reactions. Fever is usually not observed, but a rash is possible. Severe allergic reaction may be life-threatening [197]. It is advisable to administer antihistamines prior to transfusing patients who have presented repeated minor allergic reactions to blood products; the use of corticosteroids as well as using washed packed RBC units or platelet concentrates may also be considered particularly for severe or repeated reactions that do not respond to premedication with antihistamines. Patients with an IgA deficiency and anti-IgA should receive blood from donors with that same deficit or, in the case of cellular blood components, products that have been thoroughly washed.

            "text": "All blood product administration involves a potential for transmission of infections. Bacterial contamination of blood products is the cause of 10 % of deaths attributable to transfusions. The risk of bacterial contamination is higher for platelets (1/31,189 units) than for RBC units (1/65,381 units) [207], as platelets are stored at 22 \u00b0C while RBCs are stored at 4 \u00b0C. Many preventive techniques have been implemented in the last years in order to decrease the risk of bacterial infections caused by platelet transfusions, which have significantly improved the safety of platelets transfusions. For example, the incidence in the Province of Quebec of probable and definite transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections associated with whole blood-derived platelets decreased from 1 in 2,655 in 2000 to 1 in 58,123 five-unit pools in 2008 (p < 0.001) [245]. It is estimated that transfusion-related sepsis occurs in 15\u201325 % of patients who receive contaminated platelet concentrates [211]. Potential sources of contamination include unrecognized bacteremia in the donor due to Yersinia enterolytica or Salmonella gastroenteritis, Staphylococcus aureus infection caused by dental manipulation, contamination of donated blood by normal skin flora during collection and infection occurring due to manipulation of blood products. The most common germs are: Gram negative bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas species, and Gram positive like Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus cereus. The reaction usually occurs during or within a few hours after transfusion and can cause milder symptoms such as fever and shivering as well as more severe complications such as septic shock. The risk of bacteremia is more important with prolonged storage time. When a bacterial contamination is suspected, the transfusion must be stopped immediately, wide spectrum antibiotics must be given (third generation cephalosporin or beta-lactam in combination with aminoglycoside) and supportive treatment administered. The blood bank must be informed immediately, as other blood products from the same donor may need to be withdrawn. Culture of the blood product itself is indicated. Several blood suppliers now perform bacterial detection studies on platelet concentrates prior to their release into hospital inventories, but even this technique does not detect all contaminated units.",

Citrate intoxication can cause severe hypocalcemia [252]. Callum et al. [205] recommended the following strategy in order to avoid complications related to massive transfusion: monitor core temperature and prevent hypothermia using a blood warmer for all intravenous fluids and blood components; monitor the coagulation profile and transfuse platelets, plasma or cryoprecipitate to maintain a platelet count >50,000/mm3, an INR < 1.5\u20132.0 and fibrinogen level over 0.1 g/dL; monitor hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypocalcemia, and give CaCl2 if necessary.",

Its level increases linearly and is approximately equal to the number of days of storage [253]. Potassium levels have been measured in CPDA-1 and SAGM: it increases from 5.1 to 78.5 mmol/L (1st\u201335th day) in the former, from 2.1 to 45 mmol/L (1st\u201342nd day) in the latter [253]. Irradiation further increases the potassium concentration in units stored following irradiation [254]. Monitoring of potassium levels in transfusion recipients is essential, and it is advisable to administer packed RBCs at a rate no greater than 0.3 mL/kg/min whenever possible. Notwithstanding these concerns, the frequency of hyperkalemia caused by RBC transfusion is low. Parshuram et al. [254] have shown that the transfusion of 11 mL/kg of packed RBC units to critically ill children increases the potassium blood level from 3.85 \u00b1 0.55 to 3.94 \u00b1 0.62 mmol/L, a difference that is not clinically, nor statistically significant.",

Delayed hemolytic reactions are caused by antibodies in the recipient that are not detected during pre-transfusion compatibility testing and that developed either because of prior RBC transfusions or because of exposure to RBCs of fetal origin. The most frequently involved antibodies are: E, Jka, c, Fya, K [255]. The hemolytic reaction usually begins 3\u201314 days after transfusion. Most cases are mild and resolve spontaneously, but severe cases can occur, especially in sickle cell patients (hyperhemolysis). There is no specific treatment. Erythrocyte alloimmunization following transfusion can occur in 1\u20138 % of recipients and is a particular concern in young girls who may then be at risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn in future pregnancies [163].",

It manifests itself by a low platelet count (below 10 \u00d7 109/L) any time between 1 and 24 days after transfusion in patients sensitized to platelet antigens by prior transfusion or pregnancy [197]. The pathogenesis is unclear and presumably is related to the presence of platelet-specific antibodies in the recipient following previous exposure to human platelets. These antibodies destroy both transfused platelets and the recipient\u2019s own platelets. Severe hemorrhage can occur in the gut, urinary tract and/or brain. The thrombocytopenia is refractory to platelet transfusion and the mortality rate is reported to be as high as 8 % [256]. Giving platelet concentrates that are free of the implicated platelet antibodies to susceptible patients can prevent this type of reaction. The thrombocytopenia appears suddenly, but it is usually self-limiting. Steroids, plasmapheresis and immunoglobulins may be required in severe cases. The acute onset of severe thrombocytopenia following transfusion can also occur when a plasma-containing component from a donor with anti-platelet antibodies is administered to a recipient possessing the corresponding platelet antigen.",

Transmission of insect-borne zoonosis is also a well-recognized problem (for example: West Nile virus [213], malaria [259], babesiosis [260], Bartonella Quintana [261]) A few cases of prion (agent causing variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease or vCJD) transmission by a transfusion have been reported [212].

The \u201cSerious hazard of transfusion (SHOT) initiative\u201d run in United Kingdom reported that 8 out of 22 deaths (36 %) attributed to a transfusion were caused by a TA-GvHD [263]. TA-GvHD has occurred in two settings. The first clinical setting in which TA-GvHD occurs is severely immunocompromised patients (such as those with congenital immune deficiency syndromes or cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) or preterm infants with immature immune systems unable to reject donor T lymphocytes found in cellular blood components [264]. Hence the donor T lymphocytes are able to engraft, proliferate, and then attack recipient tissues. An ICU group at particular risk is DiGeorge patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery for congenital cardiac anomalies associated with this syndrome. Surprisingly HIV infected patients are not at risk for TA-GvHD. The second clinical setting in which TA-GvHD occurs is the setting in which donor lymphocytes are able to engraft because they are not recognized as foreign by a non-immunosuppressed receiver. This occurs when the donor is HLA homozygous for one of the HLA haplotypes present in an HLA heterozygous recipient. This situation can occur in a population with relative HLA homogeneity (e.g. the Japanese) or in the setting of directed donations from biologic relatives or if HLA-matched platelets are given to treat a patient with immune refractoriness to unmatched platelets [2, 264]. Symptoms usually appear 8\u201328 days after transfusion and include fever, skin rash, diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction. A severe pancytopenia can be caused by bone marrow dysfunction. TA-GvHD is fatal in 90 % of patients if untreated, a fatality rate that is significantly higher than with GvHD related to bone marrow transplantation [84]. Lymphocyte multiplication can be blocked by irradiation, which dramatically reduces and probably eliminates the risk of contracting TA-GvHD. Leukoreduction of cellular components is not sufficient to prevent TA-GvHD.",
