Unusual chest imaging manifestations, featured with ground-grass opacity, were frequently observed in bilateral (three cases) or unilateral lobe (two cases) by computed tomography (CT) scan. All labors smoothly processed, the Apgar scores were 10 points 1 and 5 minutes after delivery, no complications were observed in the newborn. Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19 should receive more attention. It is probable that pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 have no fever before delivery. Their primary initial manifestations were merely low-grade postpartum fever or mild respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the protective measures are necessary on admission; the instant CT scan and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay should be helpful in early diagnosis and avoid cross-infection on the occasion that patients have fever and other respiratory signs. other countries, is causing a global health problem. 1 ",

Ultrasound examination and fetal heart monitoring were offered regularly before delivery, no symptoms of viral pneumonia were observed. On latest admission, all patients received routine fetal heart monitoring and laboratory examinations including complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The delivery strategy is determined according to the pregnant women's general situation. Apgar scoring and nursing was routinely given for the newborn after delivery. ",

COVID-19 could asymptotically occur during gestation but get diagnosed after delivery. The manifestations include postpartum fever, mild respiratory symptoms, and typical CT images. Therefore, the protective measures for COVID-19 are necessary on admission; The CT scan and real-time RT-PCR assay could be helpful for the prevention of cross-transmission and early treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19.

Pregnant women were also reported being infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which possesses similarity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As reported by the previous SARS-related studies, pregnant women were more susceptible to coronavirus infection and at a high risk of poor perinatal outcomes. 3,4 Nevertheless, studies on COVID-19 are still quite limited, leading to a great challenge for pregnant women care. Our study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and we hope this study could provide a guidance for clinical prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant women.",

According to the previous research on SARS, the peritoneal fluid10 and faeces 11 could be positive for virus detection, and the virus might be transmitted during vaginal and cesarean delivery. As reported by a recent newspaper, a newborn was diagnosed as COVID-19 30 hours after delivery, which suggested that there may be a risk of virus intrauterine vertical transmission or infection through contact with the maternal secretion. However, another research including nine pregnant women showed no direct evidence of intrauterine infection, 12 which was consistent with the research on pregnant women with SARS,13 therefore, we need to be alert to take preventive and treatment measures for newborns in such period. According to China experts' consensus, it is recommended to quarantine the infants whose mother is suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 for 14 days. Currently, there is not enough evidence supporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk, however, breastfeeding is not recommended according to the experience from SARS.4 Owing to the absence of symptoms before delivery, all patients neglected CT scan and nucleic acid screening on admission, like most Chinese pregnant women usually do. It is probable to miss the diagnosis of COVID-19, which could delay the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and increase the risk of transmission for surrounding people, containing healthcare workers. The pregnant women's exposure to CT radiation barely reaches the dose that causes harm to the fetus,14 so it is plausible to perform a COVID-19 screening during early pregnancy.
