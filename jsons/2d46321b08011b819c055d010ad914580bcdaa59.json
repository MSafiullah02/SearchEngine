Therapeutic drug monitoring is the standard of care to balance efficacy and safety, that is, prevention of an alloimmune response (rejection) at only a moderately increased risk of infections. As data on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive kidney transplant recipients are lacking, it is fair to assume that reducing maintenance immunosuppression could be key to their management. What remains unclear, however, is the degree of immunosuppressant reduction that is required to enable SARS-CoV-2 containment. Post-transplant immunosuppression, in particular with CNIs, compromises the adaptive T cell response to a much greater extent than innate immunity and thus results in an increased risk of uncontrolled viral spreading and invasion. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of ciclosporin decreased the expression of the N protein of human coronavirus 229E; this multifunctional protein is required for viral replication 8 . Based on these in vitro data, it might be speculated that ciclosporin could be used as the preferred CNI during the COVID-19 pandemic.
