MMR vaccination counts also followed a similar pattern in 2020 until week 11, when they fell sharply and remained low for several weeks before rising again in weeks 16 and 17. The percent change in vaccinations counts in 2020 compared to 2019 varied over the course of the COVID-19 outbreak ( Table 1) . Social distancing was a topic of public discussion in England from at least early March. (2) Prior to this, in weeks 1 to 9, hexavalent vaccination was 5.8% lower (95% CI -6.0 to -5.5%) and MMR vaccination 1.0% lower (95% CI -1.1 to -0.9%) in 2020 compared to 2019. On 12 March the UK government advised that anyone with a new continuous cough or a fever should self-isolate for seven days. In weeks 10 to 12 of 2020, hexavalent vaccination was 4.4% lower (95% CI -4.8 to -4.0%) and MMR vaccination 7.2% lower (95% CI -7.7 to -6.7%) than in 2019. Full social distancing measures were introduced on 20 March.(3) In the subsequent three weeks (weeks 13 to 15), hexavalent vaccination was 6.7% lower (95% CI -7.1 to -6.2%) and MMR vaccination 19.8% lower (95% CI -20.7 to -18.9%) than in 2019.

In the three weeks following introduction of social distancing measures (weeks 13-15), the percent change in hexavalent vaccination in 2020 compared to 2019 varied by region, ranging from increases of 17.4% (95% CI 12.4 to 22.4%) in Cheshire and Merseyside to falls of more than 10% in Greater Manchester, London, the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. In contrast, MMR vaccination during weeks 13 to 15 was lower in 2020 than 2019 for all regions. The size of the percent decrease varied, with the greatest falls in London (-42.5%, 95%CI -48.2 to 36.9), Greater Manchester (-42.5%, 95%CI -55.4 to -29.7), and the West Midlands (-29.1%, 95%CI -34.8 to -23.3). By week 17 of 2020, the percent change in vaccination counts in 2020 compared to 2019 had improved in all regions, but only two regions had reached the cumulative vaccination count seen in week 17 of 2019. Discussion MMR vaccination started falling in 2020 before introduction of social distancing measures. In the first three weeks of social distancing, MMR vaccination counts were 19.8% lower (95% CI -20.7 to -18.9%) than for the same period in 2019. There were signs of a recovery by mid-late April. There was a general decrease in hexavalent vaccinations delivered in 2020 compared to 2019, but no evidence of an increase in the rate of decline with the introduction of social distancing measures. One plausible explanation is that COVID-19 messaging about staying home initially overwhelmed the message that the immunisation programme was to remain operating as usual. In England, this appears to have affected MMR vaccination more than primary infant vaccinations. The message to continue routine immunisation programmes became more visible when the Joint Committee for Immunisation and Vaccination published a statement on 17 April.(5) The relative increase in week 16 of 2020 compared to 2019 could partly be attributed to a low vaccination count in 2019 (coinciding",
