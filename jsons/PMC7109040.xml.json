Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for developed AKI and physicians should take actions before developing AKI, such as avoiding nephrotoxic agents, managing volume status and stabilizing hemodynamic status to prevent AKI development. Therefore, early detection and intervention for patients at high risk of persistent AKI is crucial for preventing adverse consequences. However, clinical risk scores for persistent AKI have not yet been developed, partly because the risk factors contributing to persistent AKI are not well known5.",

            "text": "In this study, we use the term \u201cpersistent AKI risk index (PARI)\u201d instead of RAI. PARI is a composite of risk factors and clinical signs of AKI. The rationale for the PARI is that patients who have risk factors at differing risk levels for AKI can be identified as high risk for persistent AKI by meeting the differing criteria on clinical signs of AKI, such as small changes in serum creatinine8. If a patient has higher risk factors, they require less clinical signs of AKI (very small changes in serum creatinine) early on in order to fulfill renal angina. Similarly, if a patient has fewer risk factors but shows more overt signs of clinical AKI (moderate changes in serum creatinine), renal angina would also be fulfilled. Per the epidemiology of AKI, the risk of AKI increases in a multiplicative fashion with increased risk factors. The incidence of AKI demonstrates fold-increases for higher-risk patients. Thus, just like the previous study10, the PARI was calculated by a multiplicative index based on a change in serum creatinine (namely, the creatinine component) and patient conditions (namely, condition component) in reference to the RAI for pediatric ICU patients. The creatinine component was determined based on a univariable logistic regression analysis in the association of the difference in serum creatinine values (\u0394Cr) between ICU days 0 and 1, and persistent AKI. We selected \u0394Cr between ICU days 0 and 1 because this timeframe was felt to be beyond the generally accepted window in the clinical practice, allowing time for fluid resuscitation, optimizing hemodynamics, and appropriate treatment such as antibiotics against infection. The condition component was determined based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis including the following risk factors: older age, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, morbid obesity, hyperbilirubinemia, cerebrovascular accident, cancer, high-risk surgery, nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis, and ventilator or vasoactive. We selected these candidate variables according to the previous study14,15. Age, CKD, morbid obesity and hyperbilirubinemia were diagnosed based on patients\u2019 medical charts including vital signs, and all measured inpatient and outpatient laboratory values. Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, and cancer were diagnosed based on the records of the attending physician at the time of discharge using International Classification Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes and medication information recorded at hospital admission. High-risk surgery, nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis and use of ventilator and/or vasoactive drugs were diagnosed based on the records by the attending physician at the time of discharge using ICD-10 codes, procedures including ventilator and type of surgery, and the use of intravenous drugs. The definition of these factors in the database is described in detail in Supplemental Table 1. Among these factors, those significantly associated with persistent AKI in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were assigned risk scores according to the odds ratio of the multivariable logistic regression. The condition score was calculated as the sum of the risk scores. If a patient did not have any of these factors, the condition score was 1.",

Persistent AKI is associated with a poor prognosis. However, as mentioned earlier, there are no effective treatments for preventing AKI. Early identification of persistent AKI is important to initiate an extended evaluation and management protocol in order to avoid further kidney damage. The Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup also recommends that the presence of persistent AKI should prompt a re-assessment of the possible causes of AKI and the reconsideration of treatment options. However, a clinical score for detecting the potential risk of persistent AKI has not been validated so far. The PARI can be expected to detect the potential population of patients at high risk of persistent AKI. We would like to propose that PARI is used with AKI biomarkers to stratify the risk of AKI for all adult ICU patients. The risk assessment by combining PARI and biomarkers can provide real-time clinical decision support with respect to fluid management, nephrotoxic medication avoidance, and more confidence in escalating care to include renal replacement therapy, as written in the previous paper22. For example, if patients have low PARI score, you provide standard ICU care to them. If a patient has high PARI score, you measure urinary biomarker and assess the risk of persistent AKI. According to the value of urinary biomarker  and urine output, physicians can decide to closely monitor fluid balance, stabilize hemodynamics and provide renal replacement therapy.",

As for the condition score, ventilator and/or vasoactive, hyperbilirubinemia, and sepsis were assigned scores of 4, 2, and 2, respectively.
