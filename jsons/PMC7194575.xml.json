Based on the big data of \"Baidu Migration\" (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), during the period of Spring Festival travel rush, approximately 94 thousand people inter-migrated from Wuhan City to Guangdong Province. On January 19th, 2020, the National Health Commission of People\u2019s Republic of China confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in Shenzhen City, Guangdong. Until February 18th, 2020, Guangdong government has reported 1331 cases of COVID-19 and 5 death events. Although the number of new cases remains increasing, day-on-day ratio of Guangdong, which is calculated by the number of newly identified COVID-19 cases today divided by the accumulated number up to yesterday, has changed over time. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, the day-on-day ratio fluctuated substantially from 23.1%\u201385.7% during the period of the first week, and then leveled off from January 27th to 31th. Since from February 1 st, the day-on-day ratio of Guangdong had gradually decreased. Generally, the ratio in Guangdong was significantly lower than the average ratio in mainland China (except Wuhan City). Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the two cities with the largest floating population in Guangdong, have the biggest number of accumulative cases (n = 339 and 416, respectively). The trending pattern of the number of newly confirmed cases in Guangdong is highly consistent with Shenzhen and Guangzhou (Fig. 1B).",

Based on the experience and lessons from the SARS outbreak in 2003, Guangdong is the first province in China to initiate the highest level of public health emergency response on January 23th, 2020. Following the cordon sanitaire set up by Hubei Province, Guangdong conducted multiple corresponding procedures including monitoring human body temperature in public places, restricting or closing public transit, and enforcing respirator use [4].",

Given the large number of potential infected migrants, public panic and confusion might play a critical role in the social consequences [6]. Since from January 19th, Guangdong has performed various regulatory activities including releasing most up-to-date epidemic data regularly, popularizing knowledge, interviewing experts for their opinions and predictions, and providing common-sense suggestions. Furthermore, a sizeable proportion of hospitals in Guangdong launched free online consultation to reduce the potential risk of nosocomial infection. Guangdong government also encouraged residents to avoid public places and work at home, with all unnecessary gatherings cancelled. On January 27th, Guangdong issued another strict regulation for those whoever did not wear a respirator in public would be punished and isolated. Moreover, considering the incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days, Guangdong government announced to extend Spring Festival holidays to delay returning to work and school.",

All public areas should be ventilated, cleaned and disinfected strictly. Specifically, for those areas with poor ventilated conditions including elevators and basement garages, they are required to be disinfected for no less than four times daily. Moreover, in order to control the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, Guangdong required all the restaurants to only provide take-outs without any dine-in services. Furthermore, Guangdong disposed 104 hospitals and over 17 thousand medical professionals across the province to ensure that all the infected patients can be properly and promptly treated. Most of the hospitals and professionals arranged by the government have substantial experience of fighting against SARS in 2003.",

While the majority of newly confirmed cases are from Shenzhen and Guangzhou currently, more draconian policies to control imported cases and reduce risk of human-to-human transmission are urgently needed especially in these two metropolises. Moreover, Guangdong government will continue the effective monitoring, release the timely information, and encourage the residents for maximum self-protection. With lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak, Guangdong has reserved sufficient healthcare resources and will consistently ensure the satisfaction of healthcare and medical supply from the public. It is anticipated that Guangdong is taking the lead in bringing COVID-19 under control by multiple strict regulations in combination with effective healthcare provision.",
