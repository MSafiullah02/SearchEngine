These are all complex challenges that detection of even one case can overwhelm any health systems and adversely affect the economic security of affected countries. Although the comprehensive Hajj Health Care and Emergency Management system of Saudi Arabia is well positioned to cope with known types of threats and related case management10, they are unlikely to detect any incubating transmissions that occurred among pilgrims that remain asymptomatic during the pilgrims stay in KSA.",

            "text": "Although current GHSA is yet to specifically highlight mass gathering preparedness as a strategic priority even in countries with high participant contribution to mass gatherings, the 12 Global Health Security Agenda action packages and the strategies to minimize the implications of mass gathering on public health are similar. The risk of infectious disease transmission during a mass gathering is the same or even more as the risk of transmission that prevails in any one of the home or host countries of mass gathering participants. During the world health Assembly 67, a side event took place to launch the lancet series on Mass Gathering Medicine in May 21, 2014 (Figure 1\n). Mass-gatherings are held for various purposes including religious rituals, sports activities, or festivals and therefore the demographics, risks, and the intensity of activities vary. Further, the risks are exacerbated during mass gatherings such as the Hajj for airborne, droplet, and body fluid-related transmission due to the absence of social distancing among participants; increased susceptibility due to stress, lack of sleep, and changing nutritional factors during peak events; disruption of medications among persons with chronic debilitating diseases; and participation in some of the rituals such as animal sacrifices or the practice of scalp hair shaving practices by self-help groups using unsterile blades rather than in regulated barber shops. Given that two-thirds of the emerging diseases are zoonotic, human-animal interaction during some mass gatherings such as the Hajj further increases the risk, and Saudi Arabia imports sacrifice animals from 6 countries. Thus, except for vaccine preventable diseases, perfection of disease control strategies in one or few countries alone including in the host country may not offer blanket protection from all types of disease transmission dynamics for epidemic prone disease agents present in any one of the countries. The impact of these challenges on public health during mass gatherings can be minimized by two strategies. First, each of the countries that participate in a mass gathering should have alert systems in place to identify diseases of transmission-potential during a mass gathering, control measures in place to avoid the exportation of such risks, and reduce the participation of individuals at risk increased risk for disease acquisition. For GHSA1, this relates to adequate syndromic- and agent-based surveillance, laboratory enhancements, and reporting systems and risk communication managed by adequately trained workforce including one epidemiologist for a population of 200,000. Furthermore, countries participating in mass gatherings should have public emergency preparedness in response mode and adequate surge capacity to be able to respond to potential emergencies from participants returning from mass gatherings. Existence of a public health emergency operations center with sufficient pool of response manpower and medical countermeasures available will be critical. This can only be functional if relevant a national public health preparedness policies and authorities are in place to coordinate a response with diverse organizational entities such as the ministries of aviation, defense, interior, and health.",

Health examinations and specimen collection is routine for Hajj pilgrims prior to departure in their home countries and arrival airports in Saudi Arabia conduct health screenings. Additional surveillance programs using rapid detection tests can be implemented in home and host countries of mass gatherings. Furthermore, the Hajj emergency health management system operates a network of health facilities with electronic data management systems that can conduct syndromic- and agent-based surveillance on symptomatic individuals who seek care (about 500,000 pilgrims on average during each Hajj) (10)\u2013 deliverables that correspond well with the objectives outlined in the GHSA1.",

We now have the knowledge that the world did not have during the 1957 Hajj and influenza transmission. As the search for vaccines and treatment continue for these novel challenges, first and foremost priority for the global community is to minimize the effects of emerging threats during mass gatherings would be to activate public health emergency management capacities before, during and after these mass gatherings of significance.
