Since excess liver fat is seen in up to a quarter of people,[3] we hypothesized that its impact on severity might be modulated by age. We considered that disease severity of older patients with a greater burden of cardiac and respiratory illness would more likely be impacted by their comorbid conditions, than the presence of liver fat. In this study, we investigated the effects of MAFLD on COVID-19 severity in older versus younger patients.",

COVID-19 was diagnosed by high-throughput sequencing or RT-PCR assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. Some of these patients were the subject of a previous report.[4] All subjects underwent screening for fatty liver by computed tomography. MAFLD was diagnosed based on the recent consensus criteria.[5, 6] Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) \u226523 kg/m2, and obesity was defined as BMI \u226525 kg/m2 in Asians.[7] Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the history or hemoglobin A1c \u22656.5%.[8] Hypertension was defined as blood pressure \u2265130/85 mmHg or specific drug treatment. The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the ethics committees of all four centers due to the emergent epidemic and the anonymized retrospective nature of the analysis.",

In contrast to the findings in younger patients (age <60 years), no significant difference in C-reactive protein, prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, or blood lipids was observed between non-MAFLD and MAFLD groups in elderly patients (all P >0.05). Moreover, an association between presence of MAFLD and COVID-19 severity was only observed in younger (Chi-square test P = 0.001), but not in elderly patients (Chi-square test P = 0.66).",

Considering the effects of confounding bias, we performed multivariable logistic regression analyses (Table 1\n). In patients aged younger than 60 years, a more than two-fold higher prevalence of severe COVID-19 was observed in MAFLD patients compared to those without; this association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, overweight, diabetes, and hypertension (adjusted-OR 2.67, 95%CI 1.13-6.34, P=0.03). In contrast, MAFLD was not associated with disease severity in multivariable analysis in elderly patients (P >0.05). We performed sensitivity analysis by setting a cut-off point other than 60 years to define younger and elderly patients. Similar results were observed at cut-offs using 55 and 65 years.",

The exact mechanism(s) underlying the age-dependent relationship is uncertain. Previous research has noted cellular immune dysregulation in COVID-19.[10] Thus, it might be postulated that hepatic and systemic immune responses caused by MAFLD[11] contributes to the cytokine storm in younger patients with COVID-19. In the elderly however, other comorbidities like coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more prevalent and any association with MAFLD might be masked by their impact.[2]",

When 60 years was set as the cut-off, there were only 53 non-MAFLD and 21 MAFLD in the older group for analysis. To remedy this shortcoming, we performed sensitivity analysis using 199 younger (including 56 MAFLD) vs. 128 older (including 37 MAFLD) patients with 55 years as a cut-off; the results remained insignificant in older patients. Further validation in a larger cohort from other ethnicities is warranted.
