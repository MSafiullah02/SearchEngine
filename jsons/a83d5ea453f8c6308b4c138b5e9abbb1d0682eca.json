Resumption of sport and recreation activities can contribute many health, economic, social and cultural benefits to Australian society emerging from the COVID-19 environment. 2. Resumption of sport and recreation activities should not compromise the health of individuals or the community. 3. Resumption of sport and recreation activities will be based on objective health information to ensure they are conducted safely and do not risk increased COVID-19 local transmission rates. 4. All decisions about resumption of sport and recreation activities must take place with careful reference to these National Principles following close consultation with Federal, State/Territory and/or Local Public Health Authorities, as relevant. 5. The AIS 'Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 Environment' provides a guide for the reintroduction of sport and recreation in Australia, including high performance sport. The AIS Framework incorporates consideration of the differences between contact and non-contact sport and indoor and outdoor activity. Whilst the three phases A, B and C of the AIS Framework provide a general guide, individual jurisdictions may provide guidance on the timing of introduction of various levels of sport participation with regard to local epidemiology, risk mitigation strategies and public health capacity. 6. International evidence to date is suggestive that outdoor activities are a lower risk setting for COVID-19 transmission. There are no good data on risks of indoor sporting activity but, at this time, the risk is assumed to be greater than for outdoor sporting activity, even with similar mitigation steps taken. 7. All individuals who participate in, and contribute to, sport and recreation will be considered in resumption plans, including those at the high performance/professional level, those at the community competitive level, and those who wish to enjoy passive (non-contact) individual sports and recreation. 8. Resumption of community sport and recreation activity should take place in a staged fashion with an initial phase of small group (<10) activities in a non-contact fashion, prior to moving on to a subsequent phase of large group (>10) activities including full contact training/competition in sport. Individual jurisdictions will determine progression through these phases, taking account of local epidemiology, risk mitigation strategies and public health capability. a. This includes the resumption of children's outdoor sport with strict physical distancing measures for non-sporting attendees such as parents. b. This includes the resumption of outdoor recreational activities including (but not limited to) outdoor-based personal training and boot camps, golf, fishing, bush-walking, swimming, etc. 9. Significantly enhanced risk mitigation (including avoidance and physical distancing) must be applied to all indoor activities associated with outdoor sporting codes (e.g. club rooms, training facilities, gymnasia and the like). 10. For high performance and professional sporting organisations, the regime underpinned in the AIS Framework is considered a minimum baseline standard required to be met before the resumption of training and match play, noting most sports and participants are currently operating at level A of the AIS Framework. 11. If sporting organisations are seeking specific exemptions in order to recommence activity, particularly with regard to competitions, they are required to engage with, and where necessary seek approvals from, the respective State/Territory and/or Local Public Health Authorities regarding additional measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. 12. At all times sport and recreation organisations must respond to the directives of Public Health Authorities. Localised outbreaks may require sporting organisations to again restrict activity and those organisations must be ready to respond accordingly. The detection of a positive COVID-19 case in a sporting or recreation club or organisation will result in a standard public health response, which could include quarantine of a whole team or large group, and close contacts, for the required period. 13. The risks associated with large gatherings are such that, for the foreseeable future, elite sports, if recommenced, should do so in a spectator-free environment with the minimum support staff available to support the competition. Community sport and recreation activities should limit those present to the minimum required to support the participants (e.g. one parent or carer per child if necessary). 14. The sporting environment (training and competition venues) should be assessed to ensure precautions are taken to minimise risk to those participating in sport and those attending sporting events as spectators (where and when permissible). 15. The safety and well-being of the Australian community will be the priority in any further and specific decisions about the resumption of sport, which will be considered by the COVID-19 Sports and Health Committee. All community and individual sport participants, parents/guardians of participants, coaches, 353 spectators, officials and volunteers (collectively termed community sport members) and sport 354 organisations must play a role help slow the spread of COVID-19. The safe reintroduction of 355 community and individual sport requires thorough planning and safe implementation. 356",

Sporting organisations must have a 642 clear protocol for managing unwell athlete/other personnel as a potential COVID-19 case until 643 COVID-19 has been excluded and they have been medically cleared by a doctor to return to the 644 training environment. All athletes/ other personnel must be made aware not to attend sport 645 environments if they are unwell with any of the following symptoms, even if only mild: 646 \uf0a7\uf020 Cough 647 \uf0a7\uf020 Sore throat 648 \uf0a7\uf020 Fever (e.g. night sweats or chills) 649 \uf0a7\uf020 Shortness of breath 650 Sport organisations should refer to local State/Territory guidelines on the assessment process for a 651 possible case. A doctor must make decisions about investigations, treatment, and management. 652 Unwell athletes/other personnel must always call ahead before attending for assessment. Importantly, 653 an athlete with a possible respiratory tract infection should refrain from training (even at home) until 654 they have been cleared to do so by a doctor, given the potential for worsening illness. Successful implementation of the management plan includes effective communication to ensure athletes/other 656 personnel understand the importance and implications. 657 658 Proposed criteria for resumption of sporting activity 659 Initial resumption of sporting activity will be governed by public health policy and Federal, 660 State/Territory Government directives. It is worth noting that different States/Territories may permit 661 the resumption of some sporting activities at different times, dependent on local COVID-19 662 transmission, resources and other variables influencing local policy. Even within a State/Territory 663 there could be geographical variability. Outbreaks or clusters may result in a local shutdown (e.g. ring 664 fence). Resumption of sporting activity may not be linear. Relaxing/increasing restrictions may be 665 required in response to fluctuating numbers of COVID-19 cases. 666 An initial resumption of sporting activity is dependent on several factors: 667 \uf0a7\uf020 A sustained decrease in COVID-19 transmission 668 \uf0a7\uf020 Healthcare system capacity 669 \uf0a7\uf020 Individual circumstances of sports organisation and risk assessment. 670 671 Three levels (Levels A, B, C) of sporting activities are recommended in the context of a COVID-19 672 environment",

            "text": "The resumption of sport will be a complex process. The AIS Framework provides sport with 836 a useful resource to guide planning and implementation (the 'how') of a safe return to high 837 performance/professional, community and individual sport. Decisions regarding resumption 838 of sporting activity must be based on objective medical information regarding the 839 transmission of COVID-19. Federal, State/Territory and local Public Health Authorities must 840 be closely consulted in decisions regarding the resumption of sport (the 'when').841 \uf0a7\uf020 Three levels (Levels A, B, C) of sporting activities are recommended in the context of a 842 COVID-19 environment. At each level recommended sporting activities, general hygiene 843 measures, and medical servicing considerations have been outlined. These are considered 844 minimum baseline standards required to be met by high performance/professional sport 845 before the resumption of training and competition. \uf0a7\uf020 Preparation for resumption includes education of the athletes and other personnel, assessment 847 of the sport environment and agreement on training scheduling to accommodate social 848 distancing. The approach to training should focus on 'get in, train, get out', minimising 849 unnecessary contact in changerooms, bathrooms and communal areas. Prior to resumption, 850 sporting organisations should have agreed protocols in place for management of illness in 851 athletes and other personnel. 852 \uf0a7\uf020 Special consideration should be made for para-athletes and others with medical conditions as 853 they may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. 854 \uf0a7\uf020 Progression between levels of activity (A, B, C) should be based on objective epidemiological 855 criteria of: 856 o Progression from Level A to Level B will be permitted when the local effective 857 reproduction number (Rt) has remained <1 for two incubation periods (i.e. four 858 weeks) as determined by Public Health Authorities. 859 o When sport activity has been at level B for a further two incubation cycles without an 860 increase in Rt, progression to Level C can be considered, in consultation with Public 861 Health Authorities. The timing of the progression from Level B to Level C may be 862 influenced by any evidence of transmission issues within the local community or 863 sporting cohort. 864 \uf0a7\uf020 Individuals should not return to sport if in the last 14 days they have been unwell or had 865 contact with a known or suspected case of COVID-19. Any individual with respiratory 866 symptoms (even if mild) should be considered a potential case and must immediately self-867 isolate, have COVID-19 excluded and be medically cleared by a doctor to return to the 868 training environment. 869 \uf0a7\uf020 Athletes returning to sport after COVID-19 infection require thorough medical assessment 870 prior to resumption of high intensity physical activity. While there is increasing research on 871 the multi-organ nature of COVID-19 in the acute phase, there is currently limited research on medium to long-term complications. Long-term decreased exercise capacity has been noted 873 following previous related coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS). 874 \uf0a7\uf020 Sudden increase in training load predispose to injury and a graded return should be 875 considered. 876 \uf0a7\uf020 Resumption of sporting activity may not be linear. Increasing restrictions may be required in 877 response to fluctuating numbers of COVID-19 cases. Sporting organisations need to be 878 flexible to accommodate and respond to changes in community transmission rates and the 879 associated changes in advice from Public Health Authorities. 880",
