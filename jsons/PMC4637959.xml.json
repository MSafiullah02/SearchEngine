            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical entity characterized by acute onset respiratory failure, diffuse pulmonary opacities, and severe hypoxemia, in the absence of obvious cardiac dysfunction.[1] Based on the severity of hypoxemia, ARDS is categorized as mild (PaO2/FiO2 ratio >200 and \u2264300 mmHg), moderate (PaO2/FiO2 ratio >100 and \u2264200 mmHg), and severe (PaO2/FiO2 ratio \u2264100 mmHg). With increasing severity of ARDS, the mortality increases from 27% in mild to 45% in severe ARDS.[1] ARDS is further classified as extrapulmonary and pulmonary ARDS depending on the underlying cause.[2] Apart from treatment of the underlying cause, the management of ARDS involves correction of hypoxemia either by supplemental oxygen or by the provision of positive pressure ventilation.",

Invasive mechanical ventilation is the standard of care for the management of ARDS and has been demonstrated to reduce mortality.[3] However, invasive ventilation is associated with several complications including a higher incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, volutrauma, and others. The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can potentially avoid these complications.[4] NIV has an important role in the management of acute respiratory failure, especially those secondary to acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.[567] In hypoxemic respiratory failure, NIV improves oxygenation, reduce dyspnea, unload respiratory muscle, and hence may help in avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation.[89]",

During the initial 24 h of NIV, the interface was disconnected only for intake of food and to clear oral secretions. Thereafter, depending upon the response, the off NIV period was increased gradually. Patients were weaned off NIV if they were able to maintain SpO2 \u226592% on FiO2 of 30% and the respiratory rate was \u226430 breaths/min. Worsening of dyspnea, worsening of or lack of improvement in hypoxemia, persistence of respiratory rate >35 breaths/min, appearance of respiratory acidosis, circulatory shock, or altered sensorium were defined as the features of NIV failure, and the patient was qualified for endotracheal intubation. The ultimate decision to intubate was, however, left to the discretion of the ICU physician.",

Arterial blood gases (ABG), respiratory rate, mental status, mean arterial blood pressure, and PaO2/FiO2 values were recorded at the initiation of NIV and then at 1 h, 4 h, and at the end of therapy. Liver and renal function tests, complete blood count, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score[14] (at 24 h) were performed in all the subjects. Body fluid cultures were obtained before the institution of first antibiotics. The diagnosis of malaria was based on the demonstration of malarial parasite in peripheral blood film or malaria antigen by commercially available rapid diagnostic test kit (Malaria Antigen [Pf/Pan] detection test device, Mediclone Biotech Private limited, India) performed at least twice. The diagnosis of scrub typhus was made on the demonstration of positive IgM antibody against Orientia tsutsugamushi derived recombinant antigens by ELISA method (Scrub Typhus Detect\u2122 IgM ELISA, InBios India). Presence of IgM antibody against Leptospira antigen (nine serovars; Icterohemorrhagiae, Pomona, Hebdomanis, Australis, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Patoc, Autumnalis, and Cynopteri) detected by microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) led to a diagnosis of leptospirosis. A MAT titer of 1:100 was considered as a positive result. Regional Medical Research Centre, Port Blair, provided the Leptospira strains. H1N1 swine flu was diagnosed if influenza virus RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

Enteral route was the preferred route of administration of nutrition. The subjects were followed up until ICU discharge or death, whichever was earlier.",

Even in a highly selected group of patients with ARDS, that is, only those with mild to moderate ARDS with two or less organ system involvement and the absence of shock at presentation, NIV achieved success in only 44%. In addition, in the present study, 19 of the 23 subjects in the NIV failure group died, while there were no deaths in the NIV success group. This finding is consistent with previously reported experience where the hospital mortality was significantly higher in the NIV failure group (53.8\u2013100%) in comparison to the NIV success group.[111720] The most important reason for high mortality in ARDS patients managed with NIV, apart from refractory hypoxemia is the severe systemic illness as reflected by higher disease severity scores such as APACHE II.[212223] However, one cannot rule out the possibility that overzealous use of NIV led to an inadvertent delay in invasive mechanical ventilation and might have contributed to a higher mortality in this subgroup of patients. Although the median time to intubation was 3 h, elective intubation in subjects with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <150 at 1 h could have resulted in lesser deaths, and delay in intubation have been associated with poor outcomes.[242526]",

Further, in the univariate analysis, change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 1 h and a high baseline APACHE II score predicted failure of NIV in avoiding intubation in subjects with ARDS.
