Filters are one of the most commonly used devices to remove viral aerosols because of their affordability, ease of application, and effectiveness (Fisher et al., 2009). Filtration efficiency is determined by several mechanisms such as interception, impaction, diffusion, gravity, and electrostatic attraction, depending on fiber density, diameter, filter thickness, and other factors (Hinds, 1999). However, these mechanisms are only related to the physical capture of viruses onto the substrate. Conventional filters still allow these collected viruses to infect others if reaerosolized through the respiratory processes of exhalation, sneezing, or coughing, or as a fomite (CDRF, 2006).",

            "text": "Filters can be modified by incorporating chemicals as antimicrobial agents to inactivate viruses (Gabbay et al., 2006, Silver et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2009). Aldehydes such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are also well known antimicrobial agents, as they are highly reactive molecules which are able to combine with proteins and nucleic acids of microbes by crosslinking and alkylation. Nevertheless, their use as incorporated agents has been limited in the air filtration field because of the toxic effects if small aldehyde compounds were to be released and inhaled (Mcdonnell & Russell, 1999). For this reason, polymeric dialdehydes, such as dialdehyde starch (DAS), are promising alternatives. They not only react with hydroxyl, amino, imino, and sulfurhydryl functional groups, resulting in the inactivation of viruses, but they also show very low toxicity (Mcdonnell and Russell, 1999, Radley, 1976). Our preliminary study demonstrated that a DAS aqueous suspension acted as an effective biocide against MS2 bacteriophage, PRD1 bacteriophage, and poliovirus. Thus, it is of great interest to employ DAS to modify filters for effective and affordable protection against viral aerosols.",

            "text": "A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up for aerosol filtration is displayed in\nFig. 1. MS2 aerosol was generated by a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc.) that had a virus titer of 108\u2013109\n PFU/mL at a flow rate of 7 Lpm with a pressure of 6 psi. The flow rate through the system was controlled by a rotameter, which was calibrated with a primary flow meter (DryCal\u00ae DC-Lite, Bio International Co.). The flow containing MS2 aerosol joined the other flow rate of 7 Lpm, passed through a humidifier for RH control, and then proceeded towards a 2.3-L glass mixing chamber. Thereafter, the flow was split and each flow then reached the corresponding filtration unit at a flow rate of 3 Lpm. This flow rate corresponds to the face velocity of 14.2 cm/s, which is a standard value for respirator filtration testing (NIOSH, 2005). The excess air passed through a separate line and bypassed the test filter. The viral aerosols that penetrated the test filter (\u03a6=22 mm) were collected by BioSamplers (SKC Corp.) containing 15 mL of sterile DI water at a total flow rate of 5.5 Lpm for 30 min for the experimental line. The reason for using a lower flow rate than the standard 12.5 Lpm is to avoid significant reaserosolization of MS2 at high flow rate (Riemenschneider et al., 2010). An empty filter holder without a filter was used for the control line. The collected sample was assayed with Escherichia coli as a host by the single layer method (EPA, 1984). The viable removal efficiency (VRE) was determined by comparing the PFUs from the experimental and control BioSamplers:(1)VRE=(Nc\u2212NENC)where N\nC and N\nE are the viral concentrations collected by the control and the experimental BioSamplers, respectively. To quantify the amount of MS2 virus collected in a given filter, the test filter taken off from the system was immersed into 25 mL of sterile DI water as an eluent and shaken by a wrist action shaker (Model 75, Burrell Scientific) for 15 min. To evaluate the biocidal efficacy of treated filters compared to untreated filters, relative survivability (RS) of viruses on filters was calculated by comparing survival factors, SFs, of both filters as(2)RS=SFtreatedfilterSFuntreatedfilterHerein, SF is defined as(3)SF=(NS\u03d5EE)(NC\u2212NE\u03d5CE)\u00d7VEVBwhere N\nS is the viral concentration obtained from the eluent, \u03a6\nEE is the extraction efficiency of microbes from filter, \u03a6\nCE is the collection efficiency of the Biosampler, and V\nE and V\nB are the liquid volumes of the eluent and the Biosampler, respectively. Consideration of the extraction efficiency and the collection efficiency of the BioSampler was not necessary for this relative value, RS. The pressure drop across the filter was measured by a Magnehelic gauge to evaluate filter performance using quality factor (QF), a useful criterion for comparing filter performance of different filter types and thicknesses. This value is defined as (Hinds, 1999)(4)QF=\u2212ln(1\u2212VRE)\u0394Pwhere \u0394P is the pressure drop. It should be noted that throughout the duration of experiment (30 min), the variation of the pressure drop was negligible. Experiments were carried out in triplicate and samples were assayed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was conducted using 2-way analysis of variance (2-way ANOVA) with Design-Expert\u00ae 8.0 software. Additionally, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6330F, JEOL Inc.) was used to observe morphological changes of the filters.",

Also, when CFs were subjected to the wrist action shaker, untreated filters were broken after 15 min whereas treated filters remained intact. This is presumably because of crosslinking or entanglement of DAS with the cellulose. SEM images of untreated and treated filters with different DAS suspensions, as shown in\nFig. 2, confirm this hypothesis. CFs are composed of main fibers and fibrillates of small diameter. CCF contains small amounts of fibrillates, whereas FCF has numerous fibrillates. DAS was crosslinked with fibrillates of CFs, resulting in the increase of fibrillate diameter (Fig. 2D\u2013I). Granular DAS was also observed on the surface of the main fibers at high DAS concentration (Fig. 2D, H\u2013I). In contrast, DAS was merely deposited on the fiber surface of PF with insignificant change in fiber diameter due to the lack of reaction between hydrophobic propylene filters and DAS. The difference in materials yields differences in the impact of the DAS treatment, as will be demonstrated in the following section.",

The pressure drops of untreated and DAS treated PFs were less than 1 in. H2O at a face velocity of 14.2 cm/s. These values were much lower than the inhalation resistance of 2.52 in. H2O permitted by NIOSH for certified respirators (NIOSH, 2005) and the military standard of 4.21 in. H2O for HEPA filter media (U.S. Army, 1998). Furthermore, there was no significant change in pressure drop as a function of DAS treatment. The pressure drop of untreated CCF was 3.45 in. H2O, which is not suitable for the application of a respirator. However, those of treated CCFs (p<0.0001) significantly decreased with increases of DAS concentration. Finally, those treated with the 4% DAS suspension reached the NIOSH limit for respirators. Meanwhile, the pressure drop of untreated FCF was too high to use as a ventilation filter and respirator, but those of the treated FCFs (p<0.0001) significantly decreased although the pressure drops were still over the criterion for respirators.",

For the PF, the DAS treatment did not change the fiber diameter of the filters, resulting in insignificant change in VRE. Hence, there was no significant change in QF. For the CF, the treatment did not cause discernible impact on the VRE although the treatment reduced air resistance as pressure drop decreased. Accordingly, an increase in the QF was observed. The QFs of untreated and 4% DAS treated CCFs were 0.77 and 1.46 kpa\u22121 and those of FCFs were 0.25 and 1.85 kpa\u22121, respectively. The impact on FCF (e.g., increase of 7.4 times) was larger than on CCF (e.g., increase of 1.9 times). The amount of crosslinking of the fibrillates is likely responsible for the difference.",

DAS treatments have different impacts on filtration efficiency depending on filter materials. The treatment reduces air resistance in cellulose filters, resulting in lower pressure drop while having no significant impact on removal efficiency. These factors combine to yield an improved quality factor for cellulose filter. Meanwhile, there is no difference in quality factor for treated propylene filters. Nevertheless, the biocidal effect is clearly exhibited for all treated filters. Compared to other decontamination methods, the DAS treatment does not require additional energy sources and facilities (e.g., microwave, IR, and UV irradiation) and it does not release toxic chemicals (e.g., iodine treated filter). Therefore, the treated filters can be adopted for wide applications such as in health care facilities and at pandemic events.",
