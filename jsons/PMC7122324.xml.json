Similarly, Slaughter\u2019s network theory, taking NSAs into account, revives some of the same solutions put forward by Foucault and Rosenau. Likewise my 2014 GAP thesis, while identifying the lack of accountability between State and NSAs with regard to the guarantee of human security to citizens, it did not deal with the same responsibility to non-citizens. This points to a new stage in Philpott\u2019s (r)evolutions in ideas: while each of the conversations between sovereignty and human security introduced above acknowledges the limits of Westphalian absolutism, each fails to account for their (re)imagining beyond borders.",

Referring to \u201cto the connections between religion (in the broadest sense, including philosophy as well) and legally structured power,\u201d political theology is of \u201cspecial importance in the Western world and influenced the development of juristic concepts, especially those concerned with public law\u201d (H\u00f6sle 2003, 467; Schmitt 2007). Public law, inextricable from the relationship between States and subjects, then States and citizens, is vested with antecedents of values\u2014with morals and their changing interactions with politics (H\u00f6sle 2003, 21; Carlson and Owens 2003).",

H\u00f6sle argues that Christianity estranged citizens from their State and universalized their rights\u2019 claims.\nThrough the idea of all human beings as God\u2019s children, a broader as well as existentially deeper diffusion of the universalistic and individualistic ideas of Hellenism\u2014and thereby eliminated a possible identification with any state that does not include all human beings and is not constituted in accord with the principles of Christianity. (H\u00f6sle 2003, 22)\nChristianity can arguably be made responsible for two things (H\u00f6sle 2003, 24): first, a politics free of religious and ritual considerations, taken further through the Enlightenment; and second, an intensive moralization of the religious, demanding \u201can influence on politics that went far beyond what was conceivable for ancients\u201d (H\u00f6sle 2003, 24). The latter finds its echo in the articulation and demand for individual human rights delivered by the State. Thus although the notion of a Christian theocracy likewise receded with the secularization of Westphalia, the ideas of universal human rights and of a universal claim to human security have wound their way through various (r)evolutions in sovereignty right up to this present reimagining.",

The second shift, from circa the 1960s, occurred at the height of the second wave of democratization, and in the name of \u2018 self-determination\u2019 (UNPO 2006). This meant on the one hand that especially newly minted States could cling in particular to the Westphalian notions of \u2018nonintervention,\u2019 a stance reemphasized by both blocs at the height of the Cold War. On the other hand, however, the existence of the post\u2013World War II UN and its emerging norms and values spread the notion that State responsibility includes human rights discourse if not its translation into practice. This pre-exposure arguably paved the way for the 1990s shift, which, in the words of the independent Commission on Human Security, refers to the \u2018 vital freedom,\u2019 explicitly tied State responsibility to \u201cprotecting people from severe and pervasive threats, both national and societal, and empowering individuals and community to develop the capabilities for making informed choices and acting on their own behalf\u201d (Ogata and Cels 2003, 274). What remained formally the same throughout these transitions, and became all the more pronounced as State subjects/constituents became citizens, is the onus placed on the State to assume responsibility for the security of those citizens.",

This has two implications: first, a constituent must not be a citizen. Indeed, a constituent might receive physical security within a territory in return for heeding the obligation to serve that same territorial State\u2019s security in the event of war. This leads to the second point: a citizen might have more privileges, such as the right to vote. Yet the obligation to serve the State\u2014by taxation and/or by (required) military service\u2014remains. So, too, does the threat of the revocation of citizenship if an individual serves in the armed forces or swears allegiance to another State. As is quoted on the inside of every US passport:\n13. Loss of U.S. Citizenship: Under certain circumstances, you may lose your U.S. citizenship by performing, voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship, any of the following acts: (1) being naturalized in a foreign state; (2) taking an oath or making a declaration to a foreign state; (3) serving in the armed forces of a foreign state; (4) accepting employment with a foreign government; or (5) formally renouncing U.S. citizenship before a U.S. consular officer overseas. (Authors\u2019 passport)(Generous) Provisions do exist that allow dual citizenship. Some States, the US among them, allow citizens to renounce their citizenship. Others, such as Iran, do not. While citizenship obligation has long been linked to a measure of State responsibility for protection, such as consular services overseas, it has not been synonymous with citizenship rights. By its very exclusivity, citizenship does not and cannot confer universal, inalienable rights. The concept and enactment of human security attempt to rebalance those obligations into an equation wherein State sovereign responsibilities meet individual human rights (Bergman 2010; Kerr 2007; Nef 1999; UNDP 1994).",

President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s now-famous \u201cFour Freedoms Speech\u201d of 1941 preceded the call for human security in the 1994 UNDP and again in the 2003 publication of the report \u201cHuman Security Now\u201d by the Commission on Human Security (Roosevelt 1945; Ogata and Cels 2003). From the very beginning of the post\u2013World War II period, Article 1 of the UN Charter and Article 25 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) encoded the principles of human security, including an emphasis on the right to health, which is central to the case studies presented in Chaps. 5 and 6:\nEveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care \u2026 and the right to security in the event of \u2026 sickness, [and] disability \u2026 Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. (UDHR 1948)The centrality of health among global policy priorities is reiterated in the constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); the 1994 UNDP; and the adoption of the IHR in 1969 and most recently updated in 2005.

No specific or enforceable obligation to ensure that individuals attain physical and mental health and no guidelines for how the State\u2019s obligations are to be discharged exist (Davies 2010).

Whether or not defending those values parallels interests that reach to the Hindu Kush (L\u00f6fflmann and Vaughan-Williams 2017; Maull 2006), the assertion of which resulted in the then German defense minister Struck (2002\u20132005) tendering his resignation, remains a point of contentious debate, not just in Germany. Kaldor et al. (2007) attempt to work this into an especially value-based foreign policy strategy for the EU that nonetheless takes State interests into account. This morphs into the broader conceptualization of human security, wherein an equal level of priority is given to any type of threat (Thakur 2004, 37). Critics argue that such prioritization of all is equal to prioritization of none. Liotta and Owens present one attempt to differentiate between threats, risks, and vulnerabilities as part of this debate (Liotta and Owens 2006). They arguably all converge and infringe upon human security which demands a response. A gap emerges between theory of protecting human security and its practice.",

Critically, \u201cwhile only States are parties to the Covenant, and thus ultimately accountable for compliance with it, all members of society\u2014individuals, including health professionals, families, local communities, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations as well as the private business sector\u2014have responsibilities regarding the realisation of the right to health\u201d (WHO, IHR 2005). As Lake notes with regard to judicial processes in the Congo, \u201cThe de facto assumption of power by these diverse sets of actors has created opportunities through which non-State actors can enter and influence juridical processes by engaging in tasks normally reserved for representatives of the sovereign government. These activities would not be possible in contexts where the State had greater reach\u201d (Lake 2014, 519). This exacerbates the problem of responsibility because merely counting the number of convictions of a prioritized crime or the number of people inquiring about health treatments and antiretroviral medications for HIV, for example, \u201ctells us little about the dynamics of power\u201d that determine the necessary response to the problem (including the problem definition) at hand (Lake 2014, 523). Lake notes that \u201con a broader scale, it could also be argued that the involvement of international actors in micro-level governance activities in DR [Democratic Republic of] Congo has served not to build capacity but in fact to further relieve the Congolese state of its responsibilities to provide basic goods and services to its citizens.\u201d Indeed, because a litany of \u201cinternational and domestic organizations ready to engage in this work, there may be little incentive for the central government to re-invest its own time and resources into developing a functional state apparatus\u201d (see also Keohane 1995; Lake 2014, 524).",

Consequently, the ostensibly sovereign State is ultimately responsible for the traditional, territorial security and physical security of the populace within its borders. In addition, it is accountable for both of these securitizations both internally and externally (i.e., within the international community of States). However, the same State is increasingly confronted with NSAs that both demand its action and assume some of its functional responsibility\u2014but not State(-citizen) accountability. As such, the State-centric international governance system faces the challenge of responding to both internal and external rights\u2019 demands and responsibility duties. The next chapter will further explore these conceptual challenges and analyze possible levels of such a reordering of human security responsibilities beyond borders.",
