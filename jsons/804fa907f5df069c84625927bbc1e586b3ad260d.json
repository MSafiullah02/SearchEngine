Alveolar macrophages are recruited at the site where the particles are deposited. The macrophages become activated and release numerous cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor-beta, interferon, fibronectin and interleukin-1, inducing a proliferation of lymphocytes and fibroblasts at the sites involved. The interaction between these cellular components initially produces a granulomatous reaction which can evolve into pulmonary fibrosis Although there are no precise data regarding the incidence and prevalence of the disease, silicosis was undoubtedly the most common pneumoconiosis in the last quarter of a century. In the United States, the disease was recognized as the primary cause of death in more than 4,000 workers between 1979 and 1991. In developing countries where occupational health regulations are less stringent the disease is undoubtedly still widespread Occupational or environmental exposure to the inhalation of silica particles (e.g. stone cutting, rock mining, foundry, tunneling through rock, sand blasting, etc)",

Fever and cough are the most common symptoms (80% and 70%, respectively), while dyspnea, which often appears in the diffuse forms, is less frequently encountered (60%). In cases of cavitation hemoptysis may be observed. In the appropriate clinical-radiological setting, detection of aspergillus in pulmonary secretions alone can be sufficient to justify specific treatment. Chronic necrotizing aspergillosis (semi-invasive) is more common in patients with COPD, fibrosis or pneumoconiosis. A condition of mild immunosuppression does, however, facilitate colonization. Affected subjects may be asymptomatic or have symptoms such as productive cough, hemoptysis and fever. The clinical course is indolent (months to years). The disease may, however, prove fatal Miller WT. Pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with AIDS. Clinical and radiographic correlations.

Symptoms generally include dyspnea and cough, while hemoptysis and fever are less common.

These may be associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, anorexia, weight loss and malaise, as well as signs and symptoms of the involvement of other organs and/or systems (kidney in 75-85%, polyneuritis in 20-35%, ocular symptoms in 10-15%, skin alterations in 10-15%, alterations of the musculoskeletal system in 30%). Nodule cavitation can cause cough and hemoptysis. In cases of large pulmonary lesions the chest examination may reveal signs of consolidation.
