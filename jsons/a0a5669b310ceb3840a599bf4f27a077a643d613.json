            "text": "Framing is an indispensable narrative device for news media because even the same facts may lead to conflicting understandings if deliberate framing is employed. Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however, difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually increasing prevalence of the \"Cultural identity\" frame. By examining specific topics and sentiments, we identify characteristics and dynamics of each frame. Finally, as a case study, we delve into the framing of mass shootings, revealing three major framing patterns. Our scalable, computational approach to massive news datasets opens up new pathways for systematic media framing studies.",

On the one hand, by selecting what to report-which is not always aligned with what people want to know [27] -news media can create biased public awareness (\"agenda-setting\") [30] . For instance, the proportion of Gallup poll respondents who called the Gulf crisis the most important national problem could be simply explained by the amount of its media coverage [22] . On the other hand, by determining how to report (\"framing\"), news media can potentially alter public attitudes on particular issues [2, 7, 28, 34, 42] . Framing is implemented by emphasizing certain aspects of an issue more than other aspects and making them more salient [7, 13] . For example, when reporting on the issue of poverty, some news media may focus on unemployed individuals, while others may focus on national policies. Such differences in focus have been shown to be pivotal; according to one study [21] , those who are exposed to the former framing of poverty were more likely to blame it on individual failings, while those exposed to the latter were more likely to blame it on the government or other forces beyond their control. Therefore, to understand their influence on the public, it is crucial to study framing-in addition to the agenda setting-in news media.",

Media frames are difficult to concretely operationalize as they are often abstract and subtle [5, 29] . Most of the studies on media frames are thus conducted based on manual labels obtained for a handful of specific issues and issue-specific frames, such as \"global warming\" vs. \"climate change\" [41] , \"gay civil unions\" vs. \"homosexual marriage\" [35] , \"punishment\" vs. \"innocence\" (in relation to the death penalty) [2] , and more [40] .

It is trained to predict the primary frame of an individual article using the labeled Media Frames Corpus (MFC) 3 . We used the state-of-the-art language representation model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) [9] . We fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT-base model 4 with our training data using a small learning rate, 0.0002, a maximum sequence number of 128, a batch size of 32, and a number of training epochs of 3. Since the MFC dataset is imbalanced, we added class weights in the loss function. The performance of the model, trained on 11k articles, is F 1 =71.34, based on a test set of 1,138 articles. The best accuracy yet reported among similar approaches using the same corpus, was 58.4% on the \"Immigration\" subset, in the previous study by Ji and Smith (2017) , which is excelled by our presented method. In addition to the quantitative evaluation, we present qualitative validation of the identified frames using the keywords of the articles. New York Times articles include META keywords in the form of Table 2 shows the top 10 most frequent META keywords and their top two most frequent frames. We also present the prevalence of the most frequent frame. We can see intuitive agreements between the top META keywords and the detected frames. For example, the Cultural identity and Quality of life frames are frequently found in articles with culture-, art-, and entertainment-related keywords, such as Books and literature, Music, Baseball, and Reviews. The Security and defense frame is found in articles about Terrorism, and the Political frame in articles with the keywords Politics and government and United States politics and government.",

As each article is assigned a single media frame, we simply calculate the monthly average fractions of each frame and tack them (the \"Other\" frame is excluded). Figure 1 shows the evolution of each frame over time. The first long-term trend that we can observe is the consistent prominence of the Cultural identity (orange), Quality of life (gray), and Economic (light orange) frames, as well as the gradual shift from economicto culture-and quality of life-related frames. This long-term trend may be a reflection of the general societal trend toward more sophisticated cultural needs [18] and market forces [19] The Political frame (purple) fluctuates with the election cycle. Its two strongest surges are in 2000 and 2016, coinciding with the two presidential elections that elected Republican presidents and created a lot of controversy. It is also interesting to see that the proportion for the Political frame stays high after the 2016 presidential election, indeed higher than before; the monthly average of in the 12 months from January 2017 (0.100) is higher than for the 12 months to September 2016 (0.089), and the difference is statistically significant by the Mann-Whitney U Test (U=39.0, p = 0.030). The other prominent peak corresponds to the Iraq War. We observe a surge in the Security and defense frame in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, but overall it has become less prominent over time.",

These issues are chosen as illustrative examples to show different patterns of frame dynamics; similar dynamics are shared across other issues. Figure 2 shows a stream graph of the total counts of news articles around various issues over time (at the month level), broken down into the different media frames. For 'Abortion' (Fig.2(b) ), we find that the Political and Legality frames dominate, while the presence of Morality is more noticeable compared with other issues. For 'Smoking' (Fig.2(c) ), we see that the Cultural, Quality of life, and Health frames are consistently more prevalent than other frames. We also see that the Policy and External regulation frames show a sudden increase in 2003, which may be due to New York City's smoke-free law that banned smoking in almost all restaurants and bars in 2003. For 'Immigration' (Fig.2(d) ), we see the Security frame increasing in prevalence in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, and the prevalence of the Political frame increasing around the 2006 midterm elections. This suggests that the discussion on immigration tended to be increasingly associated with security after September 11, and became one of the key issues in subsequent elections.",

Similarly, the prevalence of the Economic frame increased from 21.4% at the early stage to 27.5% at the late stage in the coverage of Hurricane Katrina. This tendency is related to frame-changing [8, 32] . To keep an issue fresh to readers, journalists shift frames over time within an issueattention cycle. For example, the emphasis of the news coverage of the Columbine school shooting moved from a focus on personal details to one on societal problems over the course of a month [8] , which is somewhat aligned with the framing convergence from the Mortality to the Political frame in relation to the Orlando shooting.",

            "text": "Here, we investigate our next research question: RQ3: How is each frame delivered? Is there a specific linguistic style (e.g., sentiment)? Intuitively, some media frames might be likely to seek to evoke a certain sentiment. For example, news articles with the Crime and punishment frame may be typically written with a negative sentiment. As the sentiment of the news articles can influence user perception, news reading behavior, and propagation dynamics [38] , understanding the association between media frames and their sentiment helps to assess the impact of these frames. We measure sentiment of each news article by using the widely adopted VADER Sentiment Analyzer [4] . While the sentiment of a word can be changed by the context [1] , a lexicon-based method has been validated with a variety of massive text data, such as books [37] , chats [24] , song lyrics [10] , news articles [38] , and tweets [15] . It should be noted that the sentiment of a headline can be taken as a proxy for the key sentiment of the corresponding article, because headlines are expected to express a concise summary of the article [3] . Figure 3 shows the number of articles with each frame (x-axis) and their average sentiments (y-axis), which are computed monthly. The clustering of the dots from the same frame is visible. In other words, each media frame is delivered with a particular sentiment, and such associations are quite stable across different events occurring in the last 18 years. Figure 4 shows the monthly average sentiments of the news articles for each frame over time. As the closely clustered dots for each frame in Figure 3 imply, in general, the sentiments associated with each frame are stable (average variation<0.1) over time. The solid black line represents the monthly average sentiment. Interestingly, the line is close to zero with a slightly negative bias, meaning that More interestingly, the aggregated neutral sentiment is also observed in a set of articles on specific issues that could be expected to have negative sentiment. Figures 5 and 6 show the sentiment of the frames, as calculated from news articles relating to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, respectively. We extract news articles by using the keywords 'Hurricane Katrina' and 'Hurricane Sandy', and limit the articles to those published in the month after the hurricanes formed.",

In contrast to the previous media studies on disasters [20] or shootings [33] , which relied on manual coding, we demonstrate the potential of large-scale media frame research. In Section 5.1, we have shown that the media coverage of the two mass shootings went through different development patterns in terms of the issue framing. We now extend this analysis on a more systematic footing. We first compile a list of 11 mass shootings that occurred in the U.S. from 2000 to 2017 [43] , shown in Table 5 . We then extract articles appearing during the month after the incident using 'shooting' and its location as keywords. One month is the most commonly used time window for studying the media coverage of shootings [8, 33, 33] . For each of the 11 shootings, we compute the proportion of each media frame and construct a 14-dimensional vector whose dimension maps onto the corresponding frame. Figure 7 shows the clusters of mass shootings by hierarchical clustering of mass shooting vectors. We use Euclidean distance as the distance metric and the Ward variance minimization algorithm as the linkage method. We refer to the green cluster (which covers the Orlando nightclub shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting) as C \u0434 , the red cluster (which covers the Fort Hood shooting, the Washington Navy Yard shooting, the San Bernardino attack, and the Virginia Tech shooting) as C r , and the sky-blue cluster (which covers the rest of the shootings) as C s . The average prevalences of each media frame for C \u0434 , C r , and C s are presented in Table 6 . We also mark the discriminating frames if the average proportion of a particular frame in one cluster is one standard deviation away (either above (up arrow \u2191) or below (down arrow \u2193)) from that in the other two clusters.",

We also found that the eminence profile of topic-agnostic frames can be used as a signature for characterizing events or issues. By digging into the framing patterns of each issue, we discovered frame convergence, whereby the dominance of the most dominant frame at the late stage is stronger than that of its counterpart at the early stage. This might reflect the many unknowns in the early stage and the consensus formed in the late stage. Moreover, we studied the association between media frames and average sentiment. We showed that even though some frames (e.g., Crime) are strongly connected to a specific one (e.g., negative), the aggregate tone across the time and topics is almost neutral.

            "text": "For future work, we consider several research directions. First, we aim to leverage the multilingual word embeddings to port our classifier to non-English news articles. In these contexts, media frame classification is often conducted by extracting representative English words from the MFC, translating the word into the target language, and extending the lexicons [14] . We will explore the potential of the multilingual word embeddings to simplify the process of detecting media frames in non-English news articles. Second, we will extend our analysis to the comparison of multiple news media outlets. Although the New York Times is an authoritative source for agenda-setting and plays a critical role in shaping public opinion, comparing various news media outlets from the perspective of their prominent frames on different issues will allow a more comprehensive picture. For example, it would be interesting to examine the political leanings of the news media in terms of the dominant frames on certain issues. Last but not least, with the advancement of neural language models, framing detection will become more accurate and be applied to more and more diverse text data. As the general media frames are universal across different topics, they may serve as a useful means of categorizing social media posts (e.g., tweets) across issues, providing a new tool to study the interaction between media and the public.",
