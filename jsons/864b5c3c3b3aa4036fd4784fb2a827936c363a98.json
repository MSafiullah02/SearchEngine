In the absence of authorised pharmacological treatments, many antiretrovirals, including darunavir/cobicistat fixed combination, are used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units. Therefore, their manipulation, even if it can strongly affect the product quality, is necessary for the preparation of suspension to meet patients' need. In this situation, it is urgent to provide data and guidance to support hospital pharmacists and clinicians in their activity. The data in this article indicate that darunavir/cobicistat suspensions compounded by pharmacists using as active ingredient a commercially available tablet can be stable at least for one week. ",

The situation is complicated by the absence of ad hoc authorised pharmacological therapies. Many antivirals, including darunavir and cobicistat, are used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, their manipulation is sometimes necessary because they are not always formulated to be administered to non-cooperative patients, like those in intensive care units. Thus, the activity of hospital pharmacists for the compounding of extemporaneous suspensions by manipulation of authorized medicinal products is crucial to provide such life-treating treatments to the hospital wards [2] . However, the manipulation of medicines can alter their quality profile with potential impact on the efficacy and safety of the pharmacological treatment. Therefore, such compounding activities must be guided by the provisions of the Good Compounding Practice and by other available technical guidelines to assure the required quality and the stability of the preparation over time [3] .",
