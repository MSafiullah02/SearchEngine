Or rather, it didn't, because the meeting was completely delocalized with the speakers, organizers, and attendees scattered across six continents and hundreds of locations, connected via a video-conferencing tool and social media. Despite this \"delocalisation\", the meeting retained many characteristics of a traditional conference: invited and contributed talks with follow-up questions and discussion, and a poster session. However, unlike with traditional conferences, all attendees avoided air travel, high registration costs (it was completely free), CO2 emission, or visa issues. Surely the impact on families was minimized as well, though participants in inconvenient time zones had to wake up early or stay up late. In this Comment, we highlight the key steps that enabled this event, offering tips and advice, to aid the organisation of similar Online Meetups.",

To this end, several of us from around the world assembled to organise the first online-only conference focused on innovations in optics, forming the Photonics Online Meetup (POM). Our vision was to provide a free, globally accessible meeting where neither the speakers nor the participants needed to be co-located. In addition to disseminating technical information, an online meeting can help reduce the carbon footprint of conference travel, reduce the burden on families, in particular time spent away from home, eliminate the cost of conference participation, and improve access to high-level technical content facilitating attendance to all. At the time of writing, APS March Meeting 2020 was just cancelled due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); we believe that online meetings can be particularly beneficial at such times. A personal view of the event from two participants can be found in refs [1, 2] while from the organiser in refs. [3, 4] .",

We selected January 13, 2020, for the inaugural event to try to avoid the winter holidays and to align with the academic calendar at most universities. Complementary to the live event, we also planned a poster session, held on Twitter starting January 9, 2020. The talks were recorded but available online only for two weeks, to keep the immediacy and spirit of conventional conferences, and to provide speakers the opportunity to present unpublished results without fear of permanent public disclosure.",

Orad Reshef and Andrea Armani took the reins as chairs, and we collectively worked on planning the event, assembling the program, inviting the speakers, and running the event.

We believe that Zoom and other similar software can be used as well. USC also provided technical support in ahead of and throughout the event.

Because of the new conference format and the lack of a sponsoring professional society, engaging the scientific community was critical to the event's success. The call for abstracts was then promoted via various social media, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram, as well as emails to colleagues. We encouraged submission of abstracts for either oral presentations or online posters. Social media acted as a seed, and then word-of-mouth helped us reach a large audience.

The hubs were very much like mini in-person conferences: groups of students, postdocs, and senior researchers watched the talks together, many of the hubs organized snacks, poster sessions, and there were plenty of opportunities for informal interaction.

More than 600 participants watched the event at the Hub sites, with approximately 500 more participating as individuals. These viewers were able to interact with the presenters through the Q&A panel, with the Session Chairs merging questions and providing clarification to enable a smooth Q&A session. The recorded videos reached an additional 200 unique viewers. Importantly, more than half of the participants were graduate or undergraduate students. For many of these students, POM was their first conference, and it would not have been possible if it had not been free.",

It included the retweeting of posters via the conference account, and almost 60 high-quality posters were made available to everyone online, with an average of 3,000+ impressions recorded per poster in the first three days --far more than one would expect at an in-person conference. Our POM-Hub model successfully merged talks broadcasted over the internet with a physical presence and community building: the 66 POM-Hubs organized organically around the world ranged from a few students getting together for pizza and POM presentations in Stockholm to a massive 65-person event in Ottawa. One Hub even developed a POM bingo game, which spread in real time via Twitter. We were thrilled to see photos in real time of students at a POM-Hub in Bombay, India at 3am, engaged in the presentations.",

Additionally, given the diverse educational level, some respondents suggested more in-depth tutorial-type presentations and extended Q&A periods; this was also pointed out by David Pile in a postconference debrief [2] . One of the invited speakers, Nader Engheta, suggested that it may be better to have questions come directly from the listeners via an audio/video connect, rather than via the session chairs [2] .",

As a result, some regions were partially excluded from the event due to time-zone challenges or the exclusion of certain users from social media.
