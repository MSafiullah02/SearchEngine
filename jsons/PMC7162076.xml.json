In Scotland, 1 in 14 people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. Surveys indicate that many patients with severe asthma have poor symptom control and reduced lung function 3, 4, 5. Asthma has been associate with various biological exposures, including mould, endotoxin, and allergens (dust mite, insect, and animal). Depending on the study, each of the agents has been reported to cause, have no effect on, or be protective of the asthma. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review all of this literature. However, only a few studies have examined these biological exposures and their association with lung function as quantified by spirometry testing and the resulting FEV1% values.",
