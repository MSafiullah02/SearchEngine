CSFV demonstrates an acute course characterized by high fever and multiple hemorrhages, as well as a chronic or clinically inapparent course (van Oirschot, 1999). CSFV is an RNA virus classified within the genus Pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (Wengler et al., 1995). The CSFV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense, non-polyadenylated RNA, about 12.3 kb in length (Meyers et al., 1989; Moormann et al., 1990).",

Formalin fixation is the standard method for tissue preservation in veterinary pathology and this material forms the major source of tissues for many studies. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues have been used for both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization detection of viral RNA (Choi and Chae, 2002; Chung et al., 2002; Choi and Chae, 2003a, Choi and Chae, 2003b, Choi and Chae, 2003c). In situ hybridization is, however, of greater technical complexity and expense when compared with RT-PCR (Kim and Chae, 2001, Kim and Chae, 2002). Therefore, application of the RT-PCR assay for the detection of viral RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is desirable. The development of such techniques is also important as formalin fixation of tissues allows veterinary practitioners to readily ship tissue samples for CSFV identification in a well-preserved, non-infectious state to avoid accidental transmission of this deadly contagious virus during transportation. The objective of this study, therefore, was to develop an optimized protocol for the detection of CSFV directly from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by seminested RT-PCR and compare this method with in situ hybridization.",

Comparison of conventional RT-PCR with seminested RT-PCR clearly demonstrated the greater sensitivity of the seminested RT-PCR approach. After tissue digestion, only a few copies of viral RNA were likely to be present in the samples. The ability to amplify specific regions of RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by RT-PCR may have a profound impact on diagnostic pathology.

However, initial digestion with proteinase K released the RNA from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Furthermore, proteinase K is known to solubilize tissue proteins and reverse monomethyl nucleotide modifications of RNA (Jackson et al., 1990). The use of a digestion buffer containing proteinase K was found to yield viral RNA suitable for RT-PCR amplification. Despite the optimized RNA extraction protocol, RNA obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was still highly degraded and, as such, one would expect smaller amplicon sizes to provide better sensitivity. It has been shown previously that the success of RT-PCR was limited in attempts to amplify large target fragments and that most success was obtained when target amplicons were small (Bresters et al., 1994; Guerrero et al., 1997). When this was tested in the present study, it was found that there was an increase in sensitivity as amplicon size decreased.",

RNA is prone to breakdown due to the ubiquitous presence of both endogenous and exogenous RNases, therefore, its degradation is usually more severe than DNA (Mizuno et al., 1998). Although RNases are very stable and highly active and do not require cofactors to function, endogenous RNases will have been totally inactivated by cross-linking during formalin fixation. Extraction with proteinase K ensures that these fixed cross-linked RNases are then totally destroyed (Lewis et al., 2001), thus avoiding any potential reactivation during the reversal of the RNA fixation in aqueous buffers.",
