So far, seven distinct viral genome types are known and, to date, all characterized viruses possess one of these seven types. DNA genomes can exist either as double-stranded (dsDNA), gapped-double-stranded (g-dsDNA), or as single-stranded molecules (ssDNA). RNA genomes can also be double-stranded (dsRNA) or single-stranded (ssRNA). ssRNA genomes are further divided into three distinct types, including negative-sense ssRNA (\u2212ssRNA), positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA), and positive-sense ssRNA that is reverse transcribed into a DNA intermediate (+ssRNA-RT). This generalized system for categorization of viruses is the backbone of the most widely used grouping system for viruses, the Baltimore classification system.",

Infections of immunosuppressed patients can lead to severe and sometimes fatal infections such as pneumonia, neurologic diseases, and diseases of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Currently, there are 57 HAdV types spanning seven species (Human mastadenovirus A-G) that belong to the genus Mastadenovirus. Like all members of the family Adenoviridae, HAdV possess monopartite, linear dsDNA genomes that are covalently linked to a terminal protein (TP) at the 5\u2032-ends of both DNA strands. HAdV genomes measure approximately 36 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length and encode roughly 40 proteins. Once susceptible and permissive host cells are infected, viral replication and particle assembly occurs within the host cell nucleus (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2).\n\n",

Scattered among these subfamilies are nine human herpesviruses (see Table 3.2). Although it is not considered a human herpesvirus, Macacine alphaherpesvirus 1 (herpes virus B or \u201cB\u201d virus) is a zoonotic agent that is associated with severe and often fatal central nervous system infections in human hosts that acquire the virus through bites from infected macacine nonhuman primates (e.g., rhesus macaques). Virions are enveloped and contain an amorphous tegument within the space between the viral membrane and the nucleocapsid. Herpesvirus genomes contain linear, monopartite dsDNA that ranges in length from approximately 120\u2013140 kbp. As with many other DNA viruses, herpesvirus replication occurs within the nucleus, and infection with many of these viruses results in obvious cytopathic effects. Many herpesviruses, including HSV and CMV, can be detected by immunohistochemistry (Figs. 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Replication of hantaviruses associated with cardiopulmonary disease occurs within pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and within the vascular endothelium of myocardial capillaries. Cytoplasmic inclusions can be seen within pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, but immunohistochemical staining provides a more specific and reliable means for viral detection. The massive pulmonary edema seen in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome patients is associated with virus-induced impairment of the pulmonary vascular endothelium.

Following inoculation, rabies virus can access the central nervous system via infection of peripheral nerves, which serve as conduits through which rabies virus travels to the brain. Myocytes and presumably other cell types at the site of rabies virus inoculation can also host rabies virus infection, but detection of the virus in these cells is difficult. With the exception of limited tissue necrosis, neuronal loss, and the appearance of characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Negri bodies) within infected neurons, rabies virus induces little pathologic change to infected tissues.
