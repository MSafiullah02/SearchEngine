Although sensitive, CT findings of COVID-19 are not specific. In addition, false-negative CT rates vary in the literature, ranging from 3\u201356% in reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients.9 In contrast, mainland China frequently employed CT as a first-line investigation for COVID-19; however, such practice was burdensome on radiology departments and hugely challenging for infection control. It is also noteworthy that the use of CT as the main diagnostic tool for COVID-19 over and above RT-PCR in China has been challenged subsequently.10 Moreover, use of chest CT findings as a diagnostic criterion were removed in the more recent sixth and seventh editions of the Diagnosis and Treatment Program of 2019 New Coronavirus Pneumonia proposed by The National Health Commission of China.4 CT in COVID-19 shows typical findings of ground-glass opacity, peripheral consolidation, or a combination of both. Ai et al. reported CT sensitivity from their Wuhan cohort of 97% when compared to RT-PCR.11 In light of this conflicting evidence, BSTI issued a statement on the potential role of CT in COVID-19, highlighting that any design of local diagnostic imaging algorithms would be contingent on RT-PCR sensitivity (dependent upon both the assay and the technique) and turnaround times,4 which have geographical variation. At the time of writing, the UK government is planning on increasing RT-PCR testing 10-fold, to approximately 25,000 tests a day.12\n",

The unenhanced LDCT prior is performed for two main reasons1: dependent ground glass is often exaggerated on contrast-enhanced CT and can be mistaken for true ground glass2; having a baseline unenhanced examination can be useful if subsequently performing unenhanced imaging to look for fibrosis. It is also recognised that on-table \u201chot\u201d review of lung windows, including lung bases on CT abdominal examinations, can be beneficial.

Within the latter, this might be due to generic increased risk of VTE with infection19 or due to a specific pro-thrombotic state caused by or resulting from COVID-19 infection. The reports of acute coronary syndromes with unobstructed coronary arteries and thrombotic gastrointestinal complications in COVID-19 patients lend weight to the latter. The question whether microvascular pulmonary arterial occlusion is responsible for some of the clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 is a hot topic. Whether this epiphenomenon occurs in the absence of macrovascular disease with PE and/or deep venous thrombosis is uncertain, but likely. The role of empirical anticoagulation in some COVID-19 subgroups is being considered, but anecdotal reports of spontaneous haemorrhage, including sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, make decision-making challenging.",

In the presence of ground glass and/or consolidation, ventilation\u2013perfusion (V/Q) assessment for macro/microvascular pulmonary arterial disease will be limited. CTPA will depict PE out to the subsegmental level, providing imaging quality is sufficient. The recent study of Chen et al.\n20 comprising 1,008 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, reported the findings in 25 patients who underwent CTPA. Acute PE was found in 10/25 with a high D-dimer level in those with PE compared to those without. Traditional ancillary imaging findings of microvascular disease, for example, in the context of chronic thromboembolic disease, may be challenging to assess reliably in the context of concomitant viral pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress. Dual-energy CTPA has been demonstrated to predict regional perfusion heterogeneity in a porcine model of acute lung injury,21 but it is uncertain whether it would accurately detect microvascular pulmonary arterial occlusion. Practically speaking, consideration will need to be given to the use of intravenous iodinated contrast medium in patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Although there will be understandable concerns of contrast-induced nephropathy, a recent meta-analysis of 28 studies and 107,335 participants found no significant differences in AKI, need for renal replacement therapy, or all-cause mortality between patients receiving contrast-enhanced CT versus those receiving unenhanced CT, suggesting other patient and illness factors, rather than contrast material are likely to contribute to AKI.22 It should be noted that patients with COVID-19, or suspected COVID-19, requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery or non-invasive ventilation pose a risk of aerosolisation.23 Transferring such patients to radiology departments for CTPA would have implications for infection control and cleaning as per local institutional policy. At the time of writing, we therefore can only endorse CTPA imaging where the result will alter clinical management and it is considered safe to administer intravenous contrast media. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the threshold for requesting and performing CTPA may be lower than originally thought, especially in cases with \u201cdisproportionate\u201d hypoxia, and potentially even in unexpectedly very high D-dimers (>5,000 ng/ml) or a new \u201csignificant rise\u201d in D-dimer.",

We would also suggest a period of 7 days of self-isolation after an uncomplicated PLB in order to mitigate the risk of a COVID-19 naive patient acquiring COVID-19 infection in the post-procedure period; it is felt that this pragmatic advice potentially reduces the risk of COVID-19 pulmonary infection as an insult on top of any small post-biopsy pneumothorax or perilesional haemorrhage.
