After being infected with CPV-2, the dog mainly demonstrates clinical signs of gastroenteritis, including anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, fever and diarrhea [1,2]. Three different antigenic variants have been reported, namely, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. These strains have replaced the original CPV-2 and are variously distributed worldwide [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. The virus is spread through the fecal-oral route and is extremely stable in the environment [1]. Therefore, rapid and reliable diagnosis of CPV-2 infection would be of great importance to improve disease management and prevent further outbreaks, particularly within a shelter environment.",

However, due to the requirements of an expensive thermocycler, a centralized laboratory facility and experienced technicians, implementation of the PCR assays is limited at the point-of-need (PON) diagnosis. Compared to the PCR assays, the use of isothermal technologies reduces the need for high precision instrumentation and consistent electrical power. Although the previously developed LAMP assays do not require specialized equipment, they are difficult to design as 4\u20136 primers are required [11,14]. A report of the iiPCR method was described its sensitive detection of CPV-2, but the assay was dependent on a specialized instrument, POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyzer [16]. Furthermore, the results of the isothermal method described above are usually produced within approximately 60 min. A simple and convenient method is still needed for rapid and reliable detection of CPV-2 cage side and in laboratories without access to real-time PCR instrumentation.",

            "text": "As a simple, rapid and reliable isothermal DNA amplification technique, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) has been applied widely for the detection of different pathogens [17,18]. The RPA reaction uses enzymes called recombinases that form complexes with oligonucleotide primers and pair the primers with homologous sequences in DNA. A single-stranded DNA-binding protein binds to the displaced DNA strand and stabilizes the resulting loop. The primer then initiates DNA amplification by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase [18]. Our laboratory had developed a real-time RPA assay based on an exo probe for the rapid detection of CPV-2, although the assay still depended on a specialized instrument, Genie III (OptiGene, West Sussex, UK) [19]. Direct visual detection of the RPA products depends on Endonuclease IV, the nfo probe and the opposing amplification primer labeled at the 5\u2032 end with biotin. The nfo probe oligonucleotide backbone includes a 5\u2032-antigenic label (typically a FAM group), an internal abasic nucleotide analog (a tetrahydrofuran residue, or THF) and a 3\u2032-polymerase extension blocking group (such as a C3-spacer). The nfo probe is typically 46\u201352 nucleotides long, at least 30 of which are placed 5\u2032 to the THF site, and at least a further 15 nucleotides are located 3\u2032 to the site. The THF residue replaces a nucleotide that would normally base-pair to the complementary sequence. The amplicons are then detected by the naked eye in a \u2018sandwich\u2019 assay format, such as a lateral flow strip (LFS), which uses anti-FAM gold conjugates and biotin-ligand molecules. A series of LFS RPA assays had been developed for the detection of porcine parvovirus (PPV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) [[20], [21], [22]].",

Other components included 420 nM each RPA primers (CPV-nfo-F and CPV-nfo-R), 120 nM nfo probe (CPV-nfo-P), and 1 \u03bcL of viral DNA or 5 \u03bcL of sample DNA. All reagents except for the viral template and magnesium acetate were prepared in a master mix, which was distributed into each 0.2 mL freeze-dried reaction tube containing a dried enzyme pellet. One microliter of viral DNA or 5 \u03bcL of sample DNA was added to the reaction tubes, and magnesium acetate was pipetted into the tubes subsequently. The tubes were vortexed briefly, spun down once again and immediately incubated in a different technician's closed fist at room temperature. The RPA was performed using body heat for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min, and an LFS (USTAR, Hangzhou, China) was used to detect the amplicons that were dual-labeled with FAM and biotin. For each RPA reaction, 10 \u03bcL of product was added to the sample pad of the strip, and the strip was then placed in a well of a 96-well plate containing 100 \u03bcL of running buffer and incubated in an upright position. The final result was read visually after incubation for 5 min at room temperature. A testing sample was considered positive when both the test line and the control line were visible and considered negative when only the control line was visible. The assay was considered invalid when the control line was not visible.",

As were most of the molecular methods for detection of CPV-2, such as PCR [15], nested PCR [13], real-time PCR [12], iiPCR [16], and LAMP [11,14], the assay was developed based on the VP2 gene. Although the point mutations in the VP2 protein have been associated with CPV types, the full consideration of the CPV variants were taken into account when designing the primers and probe, and the highly conserved region of the VP2 gene was set as the template.

TwistDx recommends an incubation temperature of 37 \u00b0C (the temperature of the human body), and other studies have shown that RPA retains reliable functionality between 31 \u00b0C and 43 \u00b0C [24,25] and even between 30 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C [24,25]. Our studies also showed that RPA could work well for detection of PCV2 between 34 \u00b0C and 42 \u00b0C [26]. Normal human body temperature (36.1\u201337 \u00b0C) is within the above temperature range, and several RPA assays have been developed to perform the reaction using body heat by either holding the reaction tube in the axilla or in closed fists [27,28]. Most of the established LFS RPA assays were performed by running the reactions in water baths or heating blocks [[20], [21], [22], [25], [28]]. In this study, the CPV-2 LFS RPA assay was performed by holding the reaction tubes in a closed fist, which is the feature of the assay. The temperature in a closed fist was monitored via a type-K insulated thermocouple (PN: 5TC-TT-K-36-36, Omega Engineering, Norwalk, CT). The wire thermocouple probe was held tightly in the closed fist, and the temperature was measured and recorded every second. The assays were performed by three different technicians in the laboratory, office and field with an ambient temperature of 18.4 \u00b0C, 27.0 \u00b0C and 29.6 \u00b0C, respectively, and the average temperature in the closed fists was 37.4 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.4, 36.9 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.0 and 35.7 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.7, respectively. The assays were further performed in cold rooms, which were approximately 4 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C. The temperature in the closed fist did not reach above 32 \u00b0C, and the LFS RPA assay did not work as well as before.",

In the evaluation of the performance of the assays on the clinical samples, the diagnostic agreement was 100% between the CPV-2 LFS RPA and real-time PCR, demonstrating excellent agreement between the two assays. Nevertheless, the LFS RPA assay showed distinct advantages in terms of detection time and equipment requirements. For CPV-2 detection, it is often sufficient to simply boil the fecal samples before running diagnostic PCR [30]. With the sample DNA extracted by simply boiling used as template, the developed LFS RPA assay detected CPV-2 successfully, and the results were the same as those obtained using the DNA extracted with the commercial kit. The above results are encouraging, but the assay must be validated by analysis of a larger number of CPV-2-positive clinical samples using DNA extracted by boiling.",

The detection target of the SNAP test is the CPV-2 antigen, and there is no amplification of the detection target during the test. However, in the LFS RPA, the detection target is CPV-2 genomic DNA. The virus-specific gene is first amplified exponentially by RPA, and then the amplicons are tested by the LFS. In the process, the detection signal is magnified hundreds of thousands of times.",
