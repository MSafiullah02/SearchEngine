The heuristics learn as their output is verified against a set threshold for the epidemiological attributes of health events that have been extracted, thus improving monitoring over time. The system aggregates the extracted events into outbreaks, across multiple documents and sources, before returning the extracted information to the system. Users of the system often prefer a more structured approach, but it may present too much information (in some cases up to 1,000 events per day). The large amount of \u201cinformation noise\u201d also may be a hindrance, since users are then required to sift through it manually. HealthMap alleviates noise by integrating data from a variety of electronic sources that already have been moderated (ProMED-mail, WHO-validated official alerts, and the Eurosurveillance RSS multinational outbreak news site), all of which are fed into a classification engine (ie, a parser), which uses the information to produce disease and location output codes.

In general, data are acquired and processed either automatically or by people, often relying on individual technologies for users\u2019 interaction with the data to tag (mark or catalog) the information for future use, and to comment on the information (for sharing and collaboration with other scientists), which can also be used to inform machine-learning algorithms (eg, statistical filters for data retrieval, such as Bayesian models). Systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. This is a good way of managing large sources of data from the Internet, which can be cumbersome and contain much content not related to health. These APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. For example, health-related attributes could include the data source, a relevant health term, the location, and the time of transmission. Natural language-processing systems extract from the feeds such relevant concepts as disease names and references to a geographic location. The information is then often assigned a dissemination format based on the information type (ie, epidemiological attribute) retrieved, through a network (eg, GPHIN), the Internet, email (ProMED-mail), or SMS (EWRS), or it is plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) published on the web (eg, HealthMap). The time needed to get from a potential data source to extracting and presenting epidemiological information that can be used as quickly as possible for preparedness or responses is critical. The results vary widely, depending on the combination of technologies used and whether or not human mediation is involved.",

In particular, the data's value to the early warning and detection of outbreaks needs to be demonstrated by evaluating the content found in social media and other Internet data sources. Primary content (ie, firsthand observations) provided by the users themselves is valuable, as it would likely signal a potential health threat more quickly. Here again, a usability study over time is needed to help show how useful primary content would be. Online media, weblogs, scientific and nonscientific discussion forums, and direct electronic communication could help expand event-based surveillance activities, although they may have unforeseen social aspects affecting both the data and the development of a health threat. Learning of the existence of disease through firsthand observations, for example, besides signaling health events can also influence people's perception of what they are observing. If the perceived risk of an outbreak is increased, more firsthand reporting could overinflate the health event. Studies of human behavior and Internet interaction may also help clarify social and behavioral effects (eg, age, gender, education level, income, and personality traits like extraversion, openness, and emotional stability) on content generated by social media and the Internet.",
