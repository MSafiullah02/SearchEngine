The role of HBoV in pathogenesis, however, is largely unknown, and little is known about the epidemiology of the virus. To study the seroepidemiology of HBoV infection, the capsid protein was expressed in insect cells. Expression of the putative major capsid protein VP2 in insect cells led to the formation of virus-like particles exhibiting the typical icosahedral appearance of parvoviruses with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. The expressed particles were used to establish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and serum samples from groups of children of various ages in China were tested for IgG antibodies against HBoV. HBoV antibodies were detected in as high as 36% of healthy children under 9 years. Of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, 31% were seropositive, and all age groups of these children showed a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody than their healthy counterparts. When divided into age cohorts, results showed that more than 48% of healthy children had seroconverted by age of 4. Thus, HBoV appears to be a common infection in children.

Eight serum samples from healthy blood donors (#2, #10, #12, #14, #15, #16, #17) were incubated at a dilution of 1:200 for specific IgG detection. The OD values at 450 nm and the samples are shown. Numbers in bold showed strong positive reactive to coated antigens. Interestingly, of the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected from 161 children with lower respiratory tract infections, only 5 were found to be HBoV genome positive by quantitative PCR with a range of genomic copies from 6.6 \u00d7 10 3 to 4.8 \u00d7 10 6 ml \u22121 . Of these five samples, three that had genomic copies over 1 \u00d7 10 6 ml \u22121 were strongly serum IgG positive, with an OD value of 1.5, 1.2 and 0.7, respectively; two were mildly positive with an OD of 0.5 and 0.4 (Table 2) . These results suggest an acute or recent infection of HBoV in these patients.

This ELISA showed specificity for the HBoV VP2 protein; no cross-reactivity was observed with the closely related bovine bocavirus BPV capsid. This is the first report to demonstrate that the HBoV VP2 protein is capable of forming VLPs, and the second to show the presence of HBoV specific IgG antibody in human sera. Importantly, a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody in relative age groups of children with acute respiratory infection was found compared with that of children without acute respiratory infection, suggesting that HBoV may be an agent causing or playing a role in acute respiratory infection in children. Nevertheless, characterization of the presence of IgM antibody or IgG in double serum samples is required in subsequent studies for precisely evaluating the status of infection of HBoV in acute respiratory infection. In addition, a high positive rate of HBoV IgG antibody in sera from healthy U.S. blood donors (aged 18-65 years) was observed in this study, indicating HBoV infection is widespread in the U.S. Together, these results also indicate that HBoV is likely first encountered in childhood, which is consistent with previous suggestions (Allander et al., 2005; Arnold et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2007; Sloots et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006) . Empty VP2 VLPs of B19 have been used effectively as antigen in ELISAs for evaluating B19 antibodies (Soderlund et al., 1995) . The capsid formed by HBoV VP2 protein, which appears to be a characteristic icosahedral parvoviral particle, was used as antigen for detecting IgG to HBoV in this study. Different coating buffers were compared in initial optimization of the ELISA. Because no significant difference in the reactivity to serum samples was observed, a high pH (pH 9.6) was used as a standard coating buffer. While HBoV VLPs might be denatured in this high pH buffer system (Wang et al., 2005) , for human B19 IgG antibody studies, results from conformational antigen (capsid) or denatured VP1 and VP2 proteins did not show a significant difference (94.6% vs. 89.5%) (Manaresi et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1371, "end": 1394, "text": "(Allander et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1415, "text": "Arnold et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1437, "text": "Bastien et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1456, "text": "Choi et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1480, "text": "Foulongne et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1498, "text": "Lin et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1515, "text": "Ma et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1532, "text": "Qu et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1553, "text": "Sloots et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1578, "text": "Weissbrich et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1705, "text": "(Soderlund et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2181, "text": "(Wang et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2355, "end": 2378, "text": "(Manaresi et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), another newly identified respiratory virus, has been detected in patients with either upper or lower respiratory tract disease, or both (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) .

For children clinically diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections in the study presented here, HBoV IgG seroprevalence rates were as follows: 22% in children younger than 12 months of age, 31% in children 1-2 years of age, and 60% in children 3 years of age. However, a high level of IgG was observed in positive sera from the children with lower respiratory tract infections [11% (18/161) had an OD value of higher than 0.8]. Either re-infection or acute infection of HBoV may have occurred, and HBoV may have been the causative agent for lower respiratory tract infections in these children.

Interestingly, all of these five children were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections and had a significant IgG antibody titer (OD > 0.4); three of them had a high IgG antibody titer (OD > 0.7), which suggested acute infection of HBoV.
