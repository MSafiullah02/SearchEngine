Highest HCAI prevalence was recorded for patients admitted to ICU and paediatric wards (28.6% and 16.5%, respectively).

Patients could have one or more hospitalization episode and one or more HCAI events during each hospitalization. Readmission was repeat hospitalization to any ward in our institution within 30 days of discharge. Several measures of HCAI occurrence were calculated: (1) HCAI patient prevalence (patient hospitalizations with at least one HCAI event/total hospitalization episodes); (2) HCAI event prevalence (total HCAI events/total hospitalization episodes); (3) HCAI incidence density (HCAI events/1000 patient-days); (4) device-associated HCAI (VAP, CLABSI, CAUTI) rates (total of each event type/total number of specific device-days \u00d71000); (5) device use ratios (total device-days/total patient-days); (6) average device-days per patient. HCAIs were infections present on admission in a child with a history of hospitalization in the preceding 30 days. Pathogens from specimens obtained <48 h after admission (without recent hospitalization) were classified as community-acquired; those isolated on hospital transfer (>48 h at the referral hospital) or >48 h post-admission were considered healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired pathogens. Laboratory isolates (bacterial, fungal, and/or viral) were considered causative pathogens if identified at the time of HCAI investigation and compatible with the clinical diagnosis, e.g. MRSA from wound swab in a patient with SSI. Bacterial isolates were categorized using the CDC list of pathogens and contaminants; repeated isolation of the same pathogen from the same site within 14 days was considered a single HCAI event.24 Fluconazole-resistant Candida species, MRSA, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (resistant to at least three classes of antimicrobials), and extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens using proposed standard definitions.25 A \u2018presumed\u2019 sepsis event was a clinically diagnosed HCAI episode occurring >48 h after hospitalization, treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobials for at least five calendar days, and lacking an identified focus of infection/laboratory confirmation of a pathogen. The McCabe score was used to stratify risk of death from underlying comorbid conditions: \u2018non-fatal\u2019 being expected survival of at least five years, \u2018ultimately fatal\u2019 being expected survival of between one and five years; and \u2018rapidly fatal\u2019 being expected death within one year.26 Surgical procedures were categorized using the CDC/NHSN criteria as: wound class (clean/clean contaminated vs contaminated/dirty); ASA score (1\u20132 vs 3\u20135); emergency vs elective procedure and operation duration <60 vs >60 min.22, 27\n",

Of note, our institution has arguably better infection prevention services/resources than most paediatric wards in the region and thus should have lower HCAI prevalence: an infection prevention nurse practitioner is dedicated to the obstetric/paediatric/neonatal platform (one nurse per 300 beds); we have the only paediatric airborne-isolation unit and many more single rooms than other paediatric inpatient facilities; and the infection prevention service is provided by one of only three academic units for infection prevention and control in the country. The true HCAI frequency may have been underestimated owing to a lack of prospective follow-up for HCAI events post discharge (only readmissions were included), lack of laboratory investigation of all HCAI events (specimens were sent at the attending clinician's discretion) and the low sensitivity of some laboratory investigations to detect HCAI, e.g. blood cultures, especially when antibiotic administration precedes specimen collection. The standard 48 h cut-off for separating community-acquired infections from HCAI may have resulted in some misclassification of pathogens. The calculation of excess healthcare costs arising from HCAI was not comprehensive and did not include costs related to patient isolation, additional staffing, consumables for transmission-based precautions, additional surgical/medical procedures and opportunity costs to children/parents from extended hospital stay. We were also unable to differentiate subcomponents of the direct costs (i.e. fixed vs variable costs) as only the total patient day cost was available.",
