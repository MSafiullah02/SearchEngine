            "text": "The term \u201cradiological event\u201d refers to incidents or effects that involve exposure to materials that are radioactive. The term \u201cnuclear event\u201d refers to any radioactive material resulting from fission. Radiological materials can be relatively innocuous, or they can be extremely dangerous, depending upon their inherent physical structure, the nature of the radiation they emit, and the amount of material involved in an incident. Nuclear materials, on the other hand, present almost no significant hazard to humans in their natural form. If they undergo fission, however, newly generated radionuclides may present a significant hazard to humans and the environment from either the fission process itself or the by-products of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is required for the detonation of improvised nuclear device (IND) and more sophisticated nuclear weapons (NW). Fission is also required to generate heat for the production of electricity in nuclear power plants (NPPs). In fission reactors, steam generated from the nuclear process is used to turn a turbine which in turn rotates a generator [1].\nMeasurement of radioactivity. Radioactivity (sometimes called the activity of a radiation source) is the term used for measurement of radioactive material. Radioactivity or activity is measured in curies (Ci) in the English measurement system or the becquerel (Bq) in the SI system (SI = International System of Units or Syst\u00e8me International). A Bq is equivalent to one disintegration of an atomic nucleus per second. A Ci is equivalent to 3.7 \u00d7 1010 disintegrations per second (dps). A Bq is so small that it is much more common to see units in multiples of Bq such as megabecquerels (MBq), gigabecquerels (GBq), etc. Likewise, a curie is so large that it is much more common to see units in fractions of Ci such as millicuries (mCi), microcuries (\u03bcCi), etc.\nUnits of dose measurement. The unit rad is often used in the English system to describe the amount ofionizing radiation that is absorbed in a cell, tissue, organ, or the body (rad = radiation absorbed dose). It is equivalent to 100 ergs of energy deposited in 1 g of tissue. The gray (Gy) is equivalent to 1 J of energy deposited in 1 kg of tissue. One Gy is equivalent to 100 rad. The rem (rad equivalent man) is a unit of equivalent dose which is used to measure the long-term biological risk related to ionizing radiation exposure (in the USA). The sievert (Sv) is the international unit (SI) for equivalent dose. One Sv is equivalent to 100 rem. The terms Gy and Sv will be used henceforth.\n",

Many believe that an RDD is equivalent to a dirty bomb. This is not necessarily the case because an RDD does not need to explode. An RDD is any device that can be used to spread radioactive materials. A dirty bomb or explosive RDD is any device that uses conventional explosives that when detonated will pulverize and spread particles or larger pieces of radioactive materials into the environment. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are detonated on a daily basis in parts of the world to cause physical harm to people or structures. The manufacture of an explosive RDD requires an IED to which is added some amount of radioactive material. An RDD could also involve the use of a device that could spread, for example, liquid radioactive materials. The consequences of an explosive RDD could involve radiation-induced injuries and illnesses, however, could also involve physical trauma and/or thermal burns.",

The NWs detonated over Japan to bring about the end of World War II in the Pacific Theater were on the order of 10\u201315 kilotons (KT) of TNT and involved the use of only a few pounds of U-235 or Pu-238. Weapons developed later during the Cold War were on the order of megatons. When discussing nuclear weapons (NW), it is important to realize that they are designed and manufactured with very sophisticated nuclear, chemical, and electrical engineering skills and techniques maintained only by the international nuclear powers. In either case, the detonation of an IND or an NW could be devastating with massive infrastructure damage and mass human casualties. The fallout of radioactive material descending to the ground after being blown into the atmosphere by the detonation can result in significant human radiation exposures. The acute and subacute consequences of such detonations will involve physical trauma, thermal burns, as well as radiation-induced illnesses/injuries.",

The manifest illness phase of ARS occurs when the damage to particular cell types, tissues, and organs appear.

In addition, the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay has been found useful at various dose levels. Conventional metaphase-spread chromosome-aberration biodosimetry techniques are robust, but they are laborious and time-consuming. In addition, for potential high-dose irradiation above the median lethal dose, it is expected that radiation-induced cell death and delay in cell cycle progression into mitosis will interfere with dose estimation. In order to overcome this limitation, quantitative analysis of radiation-induced damage may be performed using resting peripheral lymphocytes in lieu of metaphase spreads.

Lloyd et al. described an in vivo simulation of an accident with mass casualties receiving whole- or partial-body irradiation in the 0- to 8-Gy range [13]. Faced with an urgent need for rapid results, clinical triage was accomplished by scoring as low as 20 metaphase spreads per subject, compared with the typical 500\u20131000 spreads scored in routine analyses for estimating dose. However, Lloyd et al. suggested increasing the analyses to 50 metaphase spreads when there is disagreement with the initial assessment or when there is evidence of significant inhomogeneous exposure [13, 16] (Table 2).\n",

In 2000, an international group of subject matter experts that assembled in Ulm, Germany, categorized these findings into four organ systems (e.g., the hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and neurovascular systems), each of which occurs individually or in combination [17]. ARS is best thought of as a Venn diagram with four overlapping circles, each representing a subsyndrome that corresponds to an affected organ system. Depending on radiation dose, clinical findings assigned to an organ system may occur concurrently or sequentially with those assigned to the other systems. The signs and symptoms of each of the resulting four subsyndromes of ARS are summarized in Tables 3 (hematopoietic subsyndrome) and 4 (gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and neurovascular subsyndromes). The severity of signs and symptoms for each organ system is quantified as \u201cdegrees\u201d of toxicity (degree 1, 2, 3, or 4). The \u201cresponse category\u201d (grade 1, 2, 3 or 4) correlates with overall severity of ARS and is determined by the highest degree of toxicity within any of the organ systems.\n\n",

Radiation-induced damage is determined in part by the radio sensitivity of the affected cells with the most rapidly dividing cells (e.g., cells in the bone marrow, intestinal crypts, and testes) having the greatest sensitivity. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow and circulation are particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation with a dose (D0) of approximately 1 Gy at a dose rate of 0.8 Gy/min [18]. At doses of 2\u20133 Gy, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells exhibit reduced capacity to divide. Morphological changes in interphase cells of the bone marrow include nuclear karyorrhexis, cytoplasmic fragments, nuclear and intercellular bridging, multinuclearity, and pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly [19]. Chromosomal bridges and fragments are seen in actively dividing cells of the marrow. Bone marrow hypoplasia and/or aplasia may develop at doses >5\u20137 Gy, resulting in severe pancytopenia weeks to months after exposure [20]. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these radiation-induced effects on the bone marrow involve dose-dependent, clonal elimination of stem/progenitor cell populations and their progeny [21, 22]. Depending on dose, dose rate, and radiation quality factor, various degrees of pancytopenia develop several weeks after exposure [23, 24].",

Thereafter, the ANC declines over several days to weeks, depending on radiation dose. The abortive rise is typically seen with HS-1 and HS-2 and appears to indicate reversible marrow damage from a survivable exposure. The absence of an abortive rise in ANC is observed in HS-3 and HS-4 and is felt to auger irreversible bone marrow damage. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia reach a nadir at 1\u20132 weeks after exposure to >3\u20134 Gy.

Management of respiratory failure includes ventilator support with a lung protection strategy, using the lowest possible inhaled oxygen concentration to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation of >90 % [43]. Radiation damage may occur in other organ systems, including the renal, vascular, and cardiac systems. Multiorgan failure (MOF) can be an intermediate- to long-term complication of radiation exposure with significant morbidity and mortality. Vigilance for damage to other organ systems must be maintained throughout medical care. The pathophysiology of MOF is likely complex and remains poorly understood [51]. Its management includes prolonged mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic monitoring [52].\n. Internal contamination with radioactive materials is a medical toxicology issue, that is, the management of a poisoning, which is extremely complex. The potential for possible internal contamination with radioactive materials is a matter of emergency, or at least urgent, concern because treatment for internal contamination may need to be initiated within hours after the contaminating incident. Following an R/N incident, medical toxicologists and/or the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS; 24/7 emergency phone, 865-576-1005) to assist with management of internal contamination with radioactive materials should be involved.\n",
