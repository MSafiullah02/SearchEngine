            "text": "HPV is a non-enveloped particle and like other Papillomaviruses (PVs) it is characterized by having an icosahedral capsid of about 55 nm diameter (Doorbar et al. 2015). HPV genome expresses six nonstructural viral regulatory proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and the virus capsid contains two encoded proteins, the L1 major and L2 minor capsid proteins (Frazer 2009; Zheng and Baker 2006). L1 protein is highly conserved among different HPV types and only 10% of the L1 sequence is different among HPV types, and it has the ability to self-assemble in virus-like particles (VLPs)(Kim 2016; Xu et al. 2016); it seems that a surface cell protein was involved in VLP binding. Based on VLPs, VLP-based vaccines were introduced that offered highly effective protection against HPV infections(Buck et al. 2013). L1 has an indispensable role in HPV entry and the initial interaction is remarkably attributable to L1 interactions with proteoglycans (Buck et al. 2013). This virus is categorized into low-risk or high-risk. Prior studies showed that about 50\u201360% of human anogenital carcinomas belonged to HPV-16 and around 20% was HPV-18(Vera-Bravo et al. 2003). Likewise, several studies showed that the majority of HPV infections in Iranian patients were related to HPV-16. Two recommended HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix contain VLPs assembled from the L1 proteins of different HPV types (Monie et al. 2008; Siddiqui and Perry 2006). Consequently, any change in HPV L1 can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness and efficacy of vaccines that are used commonly. The aim of this study, as the first report of the most prevalent substitutions of HPV L1 protein among sequences obtained from Iranian patients, was to find mutations and their effect on the structure, physicochemical properties, and antigenic features. We also attempted to provide a comprehensive view of L1 protein as a major candidate designing vaccines against HPV infections.",

In 2014, Fleury et al. found that only a few mutations within the FG loop are sufficient to generate a new serotype escaping vaccination (Fleury et al. 2014). Shailja Pande in 2008 described that the most frequent variation in amino acid (T353P), threonine, was replaced by non-polar aliphatic amino acid and may have an effect on the structure or function of the L1 protein (Pande et al. 2008). It was suggested that it had a significant role in immune recognition and vaccine development strategies and led to conformational changes within epitopes relevant for viral neutralization. In 2003, Yoshiyuki Ishii found that three cysteines (175, 185, and 428) are required for the normal assembly of L1-capsids through trimerization and dimerization of L1; also, substitution in the mentioned regions affects the normal function of HPV (Ishii et al. 2003). The present study showed several mutations in L1 protein; however, we did not find any mutation similar to previous studies in other countries, probably due to different regions or different types of their studies.",

Expression of L1 in the insect cells by using recombinant baculoviruses system by Antoine Touze et al. (1998) in 1998 was done, showing the stability of this protein in eukaryotic cells and the yield depend on mutations in a region (83 to 97) that seemed to affect the level of expression. In 2009, Bazan et al. expressed, purified recombinant HPV16 L1 in methylotrophic yeast (Pichia pastoris) that could be useful to produce low-cost vaccines (Bazan et al. 2009). Wang in 1999 and Zhang in 1998 produced a fused form in Escherichia coli using an inducible expression system and showed the stability of the L1 protein in this host (Zhang et al. 1998). Likewise, our results confirmed the stability of the L1 protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts and showed it was a thermostable and hydrophilic protein and two selected software did not predict any signal peptide for the L1 protein.",

In 1998, Martin Sapp et al. described the conserved exclusive disulfide bond of C176 with C427 and confirmed the importance of this bond in the structure of the papillomavirus capsid and DNA packaging (Sapp et al. 1998). Conway et al. in 2011 indicated that capsids properly mature and become stabilized over time (10-day to 20-day) (Conway et al. 2011). In addition, several individual L1 cysteine residues (428, 185, and 175) have an indispensable role in this process. Similar to previous studies, the present results confirmed several cysteine bonds and found some bonds which were omitted as a result of some mutations occurred in such regions in different selected sequences. However, eight cysteine residues (13, 211, 371, 128, 405, 172, 255 and 371) were found in all selected and reference sequences which have the critical role in the structure of the L1 protein. The difference between the positions found in the present study and previous studies may be related to the different geographical regions, the different methods which used, and the different HPV genotypes.",

However, the predicted structure by (PS)2-v2 just covered 85% of the L1 sequence and by considering this fact we can conclude that I-TASSER predicted a more useful structure while it covered the complete sequence.

Based on three indices (hydrophilicity, flexibility, and surface accessibility), we found BC, DE, FG, and H1 were the highest antigenic ability among other regions of the L1 protein. The combination of B cell epitope prediction and antigenic properties clarified that BC and FG were the most capable regions of L1 with the highest ability to apply in recombinant vaccines against HPV infections (Table 9).
