Being a \u201crisk researcher\u201d means looking at things through a specific \u00adperspective \u2013 the perspective of what negative consequences a natural or man-made event, a technology, a decision could probably have on the world we live in. Our perspective is a socio-scientific one. This means, we are analyzing what consequences do risks have on the society and what can we do to decrease or prevent them. This includes the possible actions of a single consumer as well as strategies of whole governments to manage risks. How are risks perceived by people? What kinds of knowledge are needed to deal with different kinds of risks? Who should be involved, and when? What to do if conflicts evolve about how to handle risks? How to communicate risks? It is our job to answer questions like these. We are dealing with these questions in many different thematic areas: food safety, climate change, chemicals, nanotechnology, electromagnetic fields, etc. These risks pose very different problems and it seems difficult to find general strategies to deal with them.",

The recent risk-related food scandals from BSE to Acrylamide provide ample evidence that there is no simple recipe for understanding and managing risks. When we talk about risks, we may associate many different things: fears of specific hazards such as a terrorist attack, concerns regarding potential failures of complex technological systems like the ones we might face with nuclear energy systems, uncertain projections regarding financial gains or losses that we may experience in the stock market, worries about natural disasters such as the tsunami in South Asia in 2004, but also the thrill of adventure produced through bungee jumping or other extreme sports. Included in the portfolio of risk may also be worries about the competence and trustworthiness of those who manage these different types of risks (Jaeger et al. 2001: 16f.).",

What risk managers need is a concept for evaluation and management that on the one hand ensures integration of social diversity and multidisciplinary approaches, and, on the other hand, allows for institutional routines and standardized practices.

            "text": "Many definitions of the term risk exist and are used by various disciplines and for various risk events: One of the most common ones goes back to the 1980s, and in this definition the term risk denotes the possibility of adverse effects from some action or event with respect to something that humans value (Kates et al. 1985: 21; Fischhoff et al. 1984; see also Renn 1992). This definition combines two dimensions: the likelihood or chance of potential consequences on the one hand, and the severity of these consequences, due to human activities, natural events or a combination of both, on the other hand. This definition implies that the concept of risk does not exclusively describe negative consequences. The judgment whether the implications are positive or negative depends on the values that people associate with them. If we think, for example, of climate change as a risk, the possible consequences like global warming might be perceived differently by different people. Northern Europeans might have a more positive view as they would profit from minor temperature increases as they could increase agricultural productivity and tourism, while people from Africa or Asia are already suffering from lower agricultural productivity and an increase in natural disasters like droughts, floodings, etc.",

Hazards describe the potential for harm or other consequences of interest (IRGC 2005: 19). A hazard can hence be the potential of a specific dose of a chemical to produce harm. The difference between risk and hazard is that as long as nobody is exposed to the chemical or an agent like, e.g., acrylamide, there is no risk, only the potential for harm. Probability and exposure are characteristics of the risk. Renn provides a useful conceptual distinction of the two terms: \u201chazards characterize the inherent properties of the risk agent and related processes, whereas risks describe the potential effects that these hazards are likely to cause on specific targets such as buildings, ecosystems, or human organisms and their related probabilities\u201d (ibid.).",

Why is this mathematical definition of risk used in most scientific disciplines? Science is based on the principle of intersubjective validation. This means, it must be both scientifically validated (i.e., other scientists must be able to verify the results when using the same methods) and expressed in numerical terms. Apart from the traditional elements of likelihood of occurrence and severity of damage with respect to health risks, risk taking also involves other risk-related and situation-related circumstances: For example, some components of risk are not covered in the traditional technical definition of risk1:\nThe uncertainty that remains after assessing probabilities and potential for harm (there is, for example, still uncertainty about the long-term health effects of electromagnetic fields from mobile phones, etc.).The ubiquity describes the geographical spread of a damage.Persistence means the time, how long a damage lasts. The persistence of harmful effects is independent of their severity, even effects that seem not to be severe at first sight can turn out to be problematic due to their spread in time. For example, some chemicals, which do not seem to have severe negative effects at first sight, can turn out to be accumulating in the organism over years due to their persistence.Delayed effects over time, meaning that some risk consequences do not emerge immediately, but they appear after months or even years. This has, for example, been the case with the health effects of asbestos.The scope for institutional risk management and limitation (the range of possible management options can be limited by financial, political, or cultural reasons).\n",

Many risk-related and situation-related factors play an important role in how risk is perceived by individuals, groups, or social institutions, which form the subjective factors in risk perception (Slovic 1987; Rohrmann and Renn 2000). The way risk is perceived differs, for example, depending on whether or not the individual has self-perceived control over the degree of risk involved with respect to personal control and management potential (Sj\u00f6berg and Drottz-Sj\u00f6berg 1994). Such subjective factors should not be deemed irrational. When we assess risk, it really does make a difference whether one can personally control the degree of risk (say, during leisure activities) or whether one must passively accept a given risk (e.g., passive smoking).",

Certain values are the basis. It works with mind-sets of individuals that are structured by cultural patterns.\n",

The nature of this difficulty may be traced back to a number of different factors, which are subsumed under the term complexity: interactive effects among the causal agents (mutual strengthening or weakening), positive and negative feedback loops, long delay periods between cause and effect, interindividual variation and intervening variables. These are only some of the multiple factors which give hints at complexity. It is precisely these factors that make high-level scientific investigations necessary, since the cause\u2013effect relationships in complex risks are neither obvious nor directly observable. The global decrease in biodiversity is an impressive example for a risk that is characterized by high complexity. There are many factors, like the destruction of natural habits of endangered species, increasing land use for housing and industry, landscape fragmentation, intrusion of invasive species caused by globalized transport and travels, climate change, and environmental pollution, of which the interdependencies cannot completely be identified or quantified.",

Most of the scientific disputes in risk analysis do not refer to differences in methodology, measurements or cause\u2013effect functions, but to the question of what all this means for human health and environmental protection. An example: Emission data of greenhouse gases is hardly disputed. Most experts debate, however, whether a certain emission constitutes a serious threat to the environment or to human health. Ambiguity may come from differences in interpreting factual statements about the world or from differences in applying normative rules to evaluate a state of the world. In both cases, it exists on the ground of differences in criteria or norms to interpret or judge a given situation. High complexity and uncertainty favor the emergence of ambiguity. On the other hand, there are also quite a few simple and almost certain risks that can cause controversy and hence ambiguity. This is, for example, the case in the discussion of speed limits on German motorways in order to reduce the risk of accidents.",

Human activities, first of all the emission of greenhouse gases like CO2, may cause global warming. As a consequence, they place growing stress on ecosystems and human settlements. In addition, the likelihood of extreme weather events increases with the rise of average world temperatures. Furthermore, these trends toward ubiquitous transformation of natural habitats for human purposes are linked to the effects of economic and cultural globalization: The exponential increase in international transport and trade, the emergence of worldwide production systems, the dependence on global competitiveness and the opportunities for universal information exchange testify to these changes and challenges. In terms of risks, these trends create a close web of interdependencies and coupled systems.

Often, uncertainties cannot be completely resolved due to the interdependencies and complexities that characterize systemic risks. These uncertainties can be of a different nature, sometimes it is not possible to calculate the probability of a harmful event, sometimes it is even not possible to know all the factors that influence such an event. Hence, uncertainty can range from a simple lack of data to complete ignorance of the coherences. These different types must be characterized and decision rules have to be found how to deal with them.Developing methods and approaches to investigate and manage the synergistic effects between natural, technological, and behavioral hazards. This regards the organization and management of the knowledge of experts from many different disciplines, and at the interface of scientists and decision-makers responsible to implement the solutions. More collaboration and interdisciplinary is needed to be able to face risks that threat all relevant systems.Integrating the natural and social science concepts of risks to deal with both physical hazards and social risk perceptions. It is no longer sufficient to base decision only on the physical characteristics of hazards. Risk perceptions and values of the public have a high impact on the tolerability and acceptability of the risks and the solutions found to deal with them. Solutions to handle systemic risks might increasingly intervene in the everyday life, lifestyle, and freedom of people, so their concerns and perceptions have to be included when making decision.Expanding risk management efforts to include global and transboundary consequences of events and human actions. Decisions that are taken within one country will, in the context of systemic risks, have consequences for other countries as well (e.g., as regards to increase or decrease of greenhouse gas emissions). This means, that more people have to be included into the decision-making processes, i.e., more governments, more stakeholder groups, etc. More co-operation is needed, while the cultural differences between countries have to be respected.\n",

            "text": "The obvious distinction between risk assessment (the scientific knowledge related to a specific risk) and risk management (the decision making of how to handle risks) often becomes blurred, if one takes a closer look into the risk governance processes. While risk assessment concentrates on the risk agent or the source of the agent themselves, and tries to identify the extent of damage as well as the probability of its occurrence, risk management has to take into account a much wider field (IRGC 2005: 21; Stern and Fineberg 1996; Jasanoff 1986: 79f.; 2004). It comprises preventive as well as reactive action. But risk management depends on the knowledge input from risk assessment. This is a crucial point, because the outcome of the risk assessment phase might on the one hand be very directive, which means, leaving only one option for the action to be taken. This could, for example, be the case if the assessment of the health effects of a specific pesticide results in the finding that it is genotoxic already in very low doses, and the only option for preventing harmful health consequences is a complete ban of the product. If this is the case, decision making is already included in the risk assessment phase. On the other hand, risk management does not only have to consider risk assessment outcomes, but also might, for example, have to alter human wants and needs, e.g., to prevent the creation or continuing of the risk agent, or to suggest alternatives or substitutes to a specific risk agent. It can also comprise activities to prevent exposure to a risk agent by isolating or relocating it or take measures to increase the resilience of risk targets.1 This means, the issues that have to be taken into account by risk managers are often going far beyond the direct consequences of a risk. The case of the regulation of genetically modified organisms illustrates this complex task: The risk managers do not only have to consider the possible negative health effects that might be a consequence of, e.g., the consumption of genetically modified food, but also indirect consequences like possible losses in biodiversity due to the spread of genetically modified species, ethical concerns raised by religious or moral beliefs regarding the principle of a fundamental manipulation of living organisms, or effects of the ban (or public funding on the other hand) on the competitiveness of the national economy.",

Dealing with stigmatized risk agents or with highly dreadful consequences is another challenge for risk communication. Risks, such as nuclear energy, can produce high levels of mobilization and very emotional reactions in the public. The example of the stigmatization of genetically modified food illustrates, that risk communication also has to take into account much more general convictions as well, such as ethical, religious, and cultural beliefs.",

It includes four elements: Problem framing describes the different perspectives on the conceptualization of the issue: the question of what the major actors (e.g., govern-ments, companies, the scientific community, and the general public) select as risks. For example, is the global warming through climate change a risk, an opportunity or just fate? This element defines the scope of all the subsequent elements. Early warning comprises the institutional arrangements for the systematic search for new hazards. New phenomena such as, for example, the increase in extreme weather situations are taken as indicators for the emergence of new risks. Screening (or monitoring) describes the action of allocating the collected information on new risks into different assessment and management routes. This means, criteria like hazard potential, ubiquity, persistence, etc., are collected, systematically analyzed and amalgamated (Is the risk new? Is it an emergency? etc.) and related to potential social concerns.

This element consists of three generic components: Hazard identification and estimation, which describes the methods of recognizing the potential for adverse effects and for assessing the strength of cause\u2013effect relationships. Exposure/vulnerability assessment defines the modeling of the diffusion plus the exposure pathways and the effects on the risk targets. In this step, those people are identified, that are (especially) affected by the risk, for example, people with a compromised immune system, very old and very young people, are vulnerable related to an influenza pandemia. The component risk estimation can be divided into two parts: quantitative estimation describes the probability distribution of adverse effects, while qualitative estimation comprises the construction of whole scenarios of combinations of different hazards, exposures, and qualitative factors. Concern assessment is also understood as a source of knowledge and includes the varying risk perceptions and concerns of all affected actors in the risk context (Sect. 5 on risk perception).

Input for this decision comes both from compiling scientific evidence gained in the appraisal phase (risk characterization) and from assessing broader value-based issues and choices that also bear on the judgment (risk evaluation). Risk characterization includes the creation of a risk profile (including the outcomes of risk assessment), the judgment on the seriousness of the risk (including questions like: Are there effects on the equity of risk and benefits? Does the public acceptance exist?) and conclusions and risk reduction options (including suggestions for tolerable and acceptable risk levels). In the Risk Evaluation step, societal values and norms are applied to the judgment on tolerability and acceptability. In this step, the need for risk reduction measures is determined (this includes the choice of a specific technology, the determination of the potential for substitution, risk\u2013benefit comparisons, die identification of political priorities and compensation potential, conflict management strategies, and the assessment of the potential for social mobilization).

On a general level, there is the distinction between the risk producers on the one hand, and those who are exposed to the risks on the other hand. It is obvious, that between these two groups, conflicting interests are to be expected. Both groups can be further divided into subgroups with distinct interests of their own, the so-called stakeholder. They are defined here \u201cas socially organized groups that are or will be affected by the outcome of the event or the activity from which the risk originates and/or by the risk management options taken to counter the risk\u201d (IRGC 2005: 49). In general risk issues affect the four main stakeholders in society. These are political, business, scientific, and civil society representatives (as far as they are socially organized). Additionally, other groups that play a role in the risk governance process, can be defined: the media, cultural elites and opinion leaders, and the general public, either in their role as nonorganized affected public, or as the nonorganized observing public (ibid.).",

Natural disasters like tsunamis, floods, or earthquakes are, for example, characterized by high uncertainty.

This discourse is called \u201cdesign discourse,\u201d and is meant to provide stakeholder involvement at this more general level. Allocating the risks to one of the four routes has to be done before assessment starts, but as knowledge and information may change during the governance process, it may be necessary to reorder the risk. A means to carry out this task can be a screening board that should consist of members of the risk and concern assessment team, risk managers, and key stakeholders. Figure 1.6 provides an overview of the described discourses depending on the risk characteristics and the actors included into these discourses.

For example, diseases through aggressive viruses like the avian flu can easily spread to other regions through single contacts. Another example from the thematic area of the decrease of biodiversity, is the involuntary spread of a risk of invasive species (be it animals or plants). On the one hand, expensive measures are taken to preserve the habitats of endangered species in order to protect them from extinction. But then, on the other hand, it can occur that foreign species are introduced involuntarily via global transports, etc. This species then sometimes displaces the ones that have been tried to preserve. This has, for example, happened in the US Great Lakes region with some species of fish through the invasion of zebra mussels and other species through cargo ships.1\n",

The level of interdepen-dencies adheres to another problem that is typical for global systemic risks: The \u201cgoods\u201d (or, as described in this chapter, \u201cwhat humans value\u201d) that are endangered through the risk are often common goods, which means that no one can be excluded from its use or profit. Public health is a nonmaterial example for such a common good. The more interdependencies there are within a particular risk situation the smaller is the probability that risk reduction measures are taken. A characteristic of common goods is, that everyone can profit from their use, even if one does not invest in their maintenance. From an individual point of view, a rational actor (be it an individual, a company, a country or any other entity) would act as \u201cfree riders,\u201d i.e., benefit from the use of the good but not contribute to its maintenance. In terms of risk problems, such an actor would not invest in risk reduction measures, while he would profit from the risk reduction measures conducted by other actors. From a collective point of view, each actor would have been better off had all actors invested in the maintenance of the good. The more interdependencies there are, the less an individual actor feels accountable for investing in risk reduction measures.1 Weak links between the affected parties contribute to this suboptimal behavior. Anthropogenic climate change through the burning of fossil fuels and the production of greenhouse gases is a classical example, but the depletion of biodiversity can also be understood as a free-rider effect of a global dimension.",

It forces the actors of the private sector to do their own planning as to how they can meet the given standards or regulations and so shift the decision making from the government regulatory authority to the private company.

In this manner, it influences the governance process from the beginning. Public dissent due to varying risk perceptions or media hypes in the context of a certain risk are often used to push individual interests (of political parties, for example) (Shubik 1991). Such influences together with the potential of mobilization of the wider public, can lead into the playing up of some risks while other risks might be concealed or downplayed due to individual motivations.",

First, it is important to make sure that the governance process is based on the best available knowledge and practice. Second, institutions and organizations have to be strengthened so that they are empowered and have the resources to perform their tasks in the most possible effective, efficient, and fair manner (IRGC 2005: 58).1 To make sure, that the responsible institutions and organizations are able to act in that way, three analytic categories can be used to assess institutional capacity (ibid. Paquet 2001):\nThe knowledge bases and the structural conditions for effective risk management build the assets of the governance institutions. This category includes rules, norms and regulations, available resources (financial as well as infrastructure, but also access to and processing of information), competencies and knowledge (in terms of education and training), and the level of organizational integration of the aforementioned types. Organizational integration can be understood as the prerequisite for the effective use of the other types and in a mathematical sense as a multiplying factor.\nSkills describe the quality of the institutional and human performance in exploring, anticipating and dealing with existing and emerging risks, here understood as often unpredictable external conditions. They should enable political, economic, and civic actors to use effectively, and enhance the impact of, the described assets. Skills include flexibility (i.e., openness to make use of new ways in dynamic situations), vision (making use of new methods that are normally used in other contexts, e.g., foresight, scenario planning, etc.) and directivity (expand the risk context into a reframing of the whole perception if the way of life and thus driving change that impacts on the outside world instead of restricting oneself to the prevention or mitigation of external effects).The framework, in which assets and skills can be exploited for the development and exploitation of successful risk governance policies is built by the last category, the capabilities. Consequently, they build the structure and include relations (manage the inclusion through linking users and sources of knowledge; those carrying the authority and those bearing the risk), networks (constitute close co-operative structures between self-organization and hierarchy between and among groups of principally equal actors) and regimes (establish the rules, the frameworks and are formed through the two types above).\n",

Anyway, interest as well as confidence and trust into the work of the European institutions have decreased during the last years. At the same time, the Europeans expect the governments and the European Union to take the lead in reducing risks which emerge in the context of globalization, growth of the population, and the economic development. This is particularly true for the handling of international systemic risks. For the improvement of people\u2019s trust and confidence into the performance of the European institutions, the European Commission has worked out a White paper (European Commission 2001), in which a number of principles of good governance are described, which should help them to carry out the task needed for the governance of, for example, systemic risks (ibid. 10f.):\n\nOpenness: The institutions responsible for the assessment and management of risks should work in an open and transparent manner. This means they should actively communicate to the affected and interested parties and the stakeholders about their tasks, lay open their structures and what and how decisions are taken. This includes the use of a language that is accessible and understandable for the general public, in order to improve the confidence in complex structures and decisions.\nParticipation: Inclusion of stakeholders and the affected and interested public is set as a crucial task of risk governance. Acceptance in decisions about the handling of risks, and confidence in the outcomes of governance processes depend on the inclusion of the interested parties throughout the whole governance chain.\nAccountability: Roles and responsibilities of the different actors in the governance process have to be made clear. From a European point of view, it has to be made clear, which institutions carry out which tasks and where they have responsibility on national and international level. Additionally, the specific tasks of the involved parties in the different stages of the risk governance process have to be made clear.\nEffectiveness: Risk governance policies have to be effective and timely, have to deliver what is needed on the basis of clear objectives, an evaluation of future impact and, where available, of past experience. Time and effort have to be treated as spare resources. Measures have to follow the principles of proportionality and appropriateness.\nCoherence: Policies and actions have to be coherent and easily understood. As the range and complexity of institutions is constantly growing, interdependencies between different sectors are increasing, regional and local authorities are increasingly involved in European policies, etc. These tendencies require political leadership, including a strong responsibility from institutional side, to guarantee consistent procedures within this complexity.\nProportionality and subsidiarity: Throughout the whole governance process, the choice of the level at which the action is taken (from European to local level) and the selection of the instruments used must be considered in the proportion to the objectives pursued.\n",
