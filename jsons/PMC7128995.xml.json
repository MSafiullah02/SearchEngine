On March 31, 2013, the China Health and Planning Commission reported three cases of avian influenza A H7N9\u2014a virus originating from poultry and wild birds.8 As of May 14, a total of 132 confirmed cases of avian influenza A H7N9 (with 35 deaths; 27% case fatality) had been recorded by ProMED. The first case of novel coronavirus was reported in September, 2012, from Saudi Arabia. As of May 15, 2013, a total of 40 cases (with 20 deaths; 50% case fatality) have been reported to WHO according to ProMED: 30 in Saudi Arabia (15 deaths); two in Jordan (two deaths); four in the UK (two deaths); two in Germany (one death), and two in France (no deaths). Most cases were linked with the Middle East. The source of the novel coronavirus remains unknown. Person-to-person transmission has been recorded, but only in individuals with comorbidities, according to ProMED.",

The absence of rapid accurate diagnostic tests for pulmonary tuberculosis was further compounded by the widespread inability to screen for drug-resistant bacteria. The introduction of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay, which detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA and rifampicin resistance from sputum samples in 2 h, could revolutionise tuberculosis diagnostics.10 A lateral flow immunoassay for detection of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in sputum is also now available.11 Although several new rapid molecular diagnostic platforms capable of simultaneously identifying both pathogens and the genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance are emerging,12 they do not seem to be well suited to clinical presentations or downstream management strategies for patients with RTIs. Furthermore, none can identify new emerging organisms for which genetic sequences are unavailable. However, rapid sequencing technologies linked to bioinformatics have provided proof of diagnostic principle in a short time.13\n",

Such a device would improve the health and lives of patients with RTIs worldwide, and would also contribute to global health surveillance and security.
