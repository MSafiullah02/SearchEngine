We are interested in investigating whether this point mutation can also affect the immunogenicity of RBD-Fc, a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies [28], [29]. The RBD-R441A mutant was generated by mutagenesis as described. Both wild-type RBD-Fc and RBD-R441A were expressed in 293T cells and purified to homogenicity by protein A chromatography (Fig. 1C). For comparison, both the wild-type and mutant proteins were, respectively, used to immunize mice and rabbits. As shown in Fig. 2\n, both mice and rabbits developed robust antibody responses against the corresponding immunogens after the third boosting immunizations. Relatively, RBD-Fc induced higher titers of antibodies in both mice (mean end-point titer was 1/656,100) and rabbits (mean end-point titer was 1/5,904,900), whereas RBD-R441A induced antibodies with mean end-point titers at 1/145,800 in mice and at 1/328,050 in rabbits. We used a recombinant full-length S protein (FL-S) as a coating antigen to measure the titers of antibodies specific for the RBD in the antisera collected after the third boost (Fig. 3\n). Surprisingly, while the RBD-Fc could induce high titers of RBD-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits (mean end-point titers were 1/656,100 and 1/437,400, respectively), the R441A mutant only induced RBD-specific antibody titers at 1/2700 in mice and 1/1800 in rabbits, respectively.",

We have recently isolated a set of novel anti-RBD mAbs from the mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV or recombinant full-length S protein, and their epitopes have been initially grouped by binding competition (designated as Group A\u2013C and Group a\u2013c, respectively) (Fig. 5\n). Consistently, these novel anti-RBD mAbs possess potent neutralizing activity, but they may target different epitopes as shown by their unique specificity to block receptor binding (data not shown). To probe antigenic structure in the RBD bearing R441A mutation, the representative anti-RBD mAbs from each epitopic groups were used in ELISA to measure their reactivity with both wild-type and mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, all anti-RBD mAbs strongly reacted with RBD-Fc, but only three conformation-dependent mAbs (24F4, 33G4, and S25) were able to recognize the RBD-R441. We have known that the epitope for S25 (Group D) differs from those of the Conf V mAbs (24F4 and 33G4) as shown by their binding competition and their capacity to block receptor binding (data not shown). It was of interest to note that the reactivity of one mAb (4D5) targeting the linear epitope (residues 435\u2013451) was significantly reduced by R441A substitution, while the mAb 17H9 targeting the residues 458\u2013465 reacted with both proteins equally. These results suggest that R441A substitution can disrupt the majority of conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, and that the Conf V and Group D epitopes are relatively stable and conserved.",

First, we used an ELISA-based assay to compare the binding activities of both RBD-Fc and RBD-R441A to soluble ACE2. As shown in Fig. 7\n, RBD-Fc could bind to the soluble ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas RBD-R441A had no binding activity at a concentration up to 10 \u03bcg/ml, at which the wild-type RBD-Fc reached a reactive plateau.

In parallel, we tested the inhibitory activity of both RBD-Fc and RBD-R441A on SARS pseudovirus. As expected, RBD-Fc was able to inhibit SARS pseudovirus infection with an IC50 of 1.12 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 9\n), whereas the RBD-R441A had no inhibitory effect at a concentration as high as 100 \u03bcg/ml, suggesting that the RBD mutant could not compete with the virion to bind to the receptor. Taken together, these data suggest that R441A substitution may damage the receptor-binding motif in the RBD.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV emerged in the winter of 2002\u20132003 and killed approximately 800 people, \u223c10% of those infected [1], [2], [34], [35], [36]. Although there are no recent SARS outbreaks, the need to develop effective vaccines remains of high importance to prevent future epidemic caused by the SARS-CoV, which may re-emerge from animal reservoirs [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. To this end, structural and functional characterization of SARS-CoV is one of the highest priorities. Yi et al. [33] recently reported that single amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV S protein determine the viral entry and immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies, but the mechanisms that caused these phenotypes remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used the RBD-Fc as a model to study how a single residue mutation in the RBD can abolish the major function of full-length S protein, since this molecule can efficiently bind to the receptor ACE2 and contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes (Conf I\u2013VI) capable of inducing highly potent neutralizing antibodies [29]. We converted arginine 441 to alanine (R441A), which was shown to disrupt the immunogenicity of full length to induce neutralizing antibodies and S protein-mediated viral entry [33], and evaluated its effect on the antigenic structure and binding function of the RBD. First, we found that R441A substitution could completely abolish the ability of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies in the immunized mice and rabbits. We then probed the antigenic epitopes in the RBD bearing R441A by a panel of anti-RBD mAbs recognizing different epitopes in the RBD and found that this mutation could disrupt the major neutralizing epitopes. These results provide direct evidence to explain why RBD-R441A mutant could not induce neutralizing antibodies. Although Conf V and Group D neutralizing epitopes in the RBD-R441A retained partial reactivity with the corresponding mAbs, they failed to elicit functional antibodies in either mice or rabbits. These data indicate that the residue R441 is essential for maintaining the antigenic structure in the RBD, which confers the immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies.",

Although the RBD of SARS-CoV is a major target of neutralizing antibodies, the S protein also contains some neutralizing epitopes in the other domains. For example, it was reported that the linear epitopes in the HR2 region of the S2 subunit, which is far away from the RBD, could induce antibodies with moderate neutralizing activity [30]. We have recently found that the N-terminal region (residues 13\u2013327) of S protein also contains neutralizing epitopes (data not shown). Therefore, further structural characterization on the S protein may provide important information for understanding why a single point mutation in RBD affects the immunogenicity of the entire S protein.",

            "text": "We subsequently documented that R441A mutation was able to completely abolish RBD-mediated binding activity to the receptor ACE2. The RBD-R441A molecule could not bind to either soluble or cell-associated ACE2 as shown by ELISA and flow cytometry-based assays, respectively. Moreover, the RBD with R441A substitution also lost its inhibitory ability against viral entry. Therefore, our data indicate that the residue R441 is not only essential for the antigenic structure in the RBD, but also critical for the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Crystal structure of the RBD in complex human ACE2 reveals that only a few of the many contacting residues in the large interface between the S protein and receptor determine the efficiency of virus binding and infection [29]. The ACE2 is bound by an extended loop in the S protein that projects from a compact core formed by residues 424\u2013494, the RBM. In particular, a methyl group from a threonine residue at position 487 of the S protein at the interface extends into a hydrophobic pocket in ACE2 that contains a lysine residue at position 353. Although the R441 is not one of 14 residues on the loop that contact 18 residues on human ACE2 [29], its substitution might change the configuration of RBM and thereby disrupts interaction of the residues between RBM and ACE2. Subsequently, the conformational change of the RBD might result in a dramatic alteration in its antigenic structure. Therefore, retaining the critical residues and proper antigenic conformations in RBD is important for developing SARS vaccines. The sites in RBD containing critical residues, e.g., R441, can be used as targets for rational design of therapeutics.",
