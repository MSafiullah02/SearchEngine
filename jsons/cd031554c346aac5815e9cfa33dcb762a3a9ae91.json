However, the therapeutic efficiency is unsatisfactory, particularly in East Asia. Such inefficiency might be a result of the short halflife, relatively low local concentration and strong side-effects of interferons. Frequent and repeated injection is also a big burden for patients. In the present study, a single dose of vector-delivered IFN\u03b11 was tested for its anti-HBV effects.",

In the HBV-producing mice, the concentration of IFN\u03b11 in the liver was eight-fold higher than that in plasma. Compared with control groups, HBeAg/HBsAg antigen levels were reduced by more than ten-fold from day 1-5, and dropped to an undetectable level on day 9 in the AAV-IFN\u03b11 group. Concurrently, the level of viral DNA decreased over 30-fold for several weeks.",

Of these individuals, approximately 25% develop HBVassociated diseases, including liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, HCC is the second leading cause of cancer related death in China [4] . Based on comparison of the HBV genome sequence, eight genotypes of HBV (A to H) have been classified [5] [6] [7] [8] . These genotypes have distinct geographical distributions [9] [10] [11] . Genotypes A and D have a higher prevalence in Europe and North America whereas genotypes B and C are prevalent in East Asia, including China, Japan, and other countries in South Asia. In China, genotypes C and B account for approximately 60% and 40% of infected individuals, respectively, whereas the other genotypes are very rare.

Under normal/healthy conditions, only a low level of IFNs are expressed, yet they increase when the body is attacked by viral infections, or exposed to double-stranded RNA [12] . Therefore, IFNs have been considered as a natural medical resource for antiviral agents since the 1960s. However, due to the high cost of development, only IFN\u03b12 is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is widely applied in therapeutic use against specific types of leukemia [13] [14] [15] , multiple sclerosis [16, 17] , hepatitis B [18] [19] [20] and C [21] [22] [23] , genital warts [24] [25] [26] and cancers [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

IFN\u03b12 has been routinely used as an antiviral agent to treat chronic HBV (CHB) infection in the last two decades. Unfortunately, the therapeutic outcomes for many Asian patients, who account for 75% of CHB carriers and are infected by genotype B or C virus, are far from satisfactory [32, 33] . It has been found that genotype B and C HBV predisposed the patients to a higher risk of complications, including liver cirrhosis and HCC [34] [35] [36] . Several factors, including short half-life, limited possible dosage and a low local hepatic concentration of IFN, may cause the therapeutic inefficiency. On the other hand, IFN has many subtypes, and each of them bears different specificities and efficacies against viruses [12] . It has been shown that CHB patients with genotype A respond to IFN\u03b12 treatment markedly better than those with genotype C [37] [38] [39] . The antiviral effects of other IFN\u03b1 subtypes for genotype C HBV are yet to be tested. Our previous studies demonstrated that the anti-SARS coronavirus activities of IFN\u03b11 were over 20fold stronger than those of IFN\u03b12 (He et al., unpublished data) . Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the anti-HBV activities of IFN\u03b11, particularly against the genotype C virus.",

They were incubated at 37 \u2022 C under 5% CO 2 . For HepAD38 cells, the medium was supplied with 400 \u00b5g/ml G418 and 0.3 \u00b5g/ml tetracycline.

Compared with the PBS and AAV-EGFP group, the mean value of viral loads in AAV-IFN\u03b11 group decreased by over 30-fold on days 5, 9, and 21 ( Figure 3C ).",

Apart from this, the frequent and repeated injection of IFN during anti-HBV treatment has burdened patients even more. According to previous studies, an effective anti-HBV or anti-WHBV therapy could be achieved by expressing IFN\u03b1 stably via SV40 or AAV-mediated gene transfer [57, 58] . Although SV40 vector may not be suitable for human gene therapy whereas WHBV is different from human HBV, these results suggest that gene therapy would be a good alternative for anti-HBV treatment.

Its ability to mediate long-term transgene expression in the liver is one of the major advantages. Our previous study showed that angiostatin could last for at least 6 months in the liver of immunocompetent mice when it was introduced by AAV2 [56] . A similar observation was revealed in the present study, in which the IFN\u03b11 could last for at least 2 months in the liver in either immunocompetent or nude mice. Although AAV8 displayed better transduction efficiency to hepatocytes than AAV2, no clinical trial data concerning the efficacy and safety of AAV8 are available. In the present study, a better transduction ratio (i.e. similar to that of AAV8) was achieved by administration of high-dose AAV2 via hydrodynamic transfection (Figure 4 ). For clinical application, drugs or rAAV2 could be administrated through the portal vein or localized perfusion so as to extend their dwelling time and to improve their therapeutic effects (e.g. high level transduction) [59, 60] . In order to simulate the clinical condition, we used AAV2 as the gene delivery vector in the present study. Our results showed that rAAV-IFN\u03b11 reduced the expression of both HBsAg and HBeAg in a sustained manner, and suppressed the viral replication without detectable liver toxicity ( Figure 3) .",

The EGFP expression level and the transduction efficiency were increased with an elevation of the multiplicity of infection, whereas strong fluorescent signals lasted for several passages (data not shown). Prolonged IFN\u03b11 gene expression mediated by rAAV in hepatocytes was observed ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, we performed preadministration of rAAV before hydrodynamic transfection of pHBV plasmid to resolve the difficulty of importing HBV-carrier animals (i.e. HBV transgenic mice), and also the problems of short-term gene expression and replication of HBV in the hydrodynamic transfection mouse model. In the present study, strong EGFP and IFN\u03b11 signals were demonstrated in the liver cells (Figure 4 ). High levels of IFN\u03b11 were observed in the liver for at least 4 weeks (data not shown). The concentration of IFN\u03b11 in the liver was approximately eight-fold higher than that in the plasma. Since the half-life of IFN is short (i.e. approximately 2 h) in a healthy circulation system and the repeated injection of IFN was one of the major concerns, a sustained level of IFN in the liver is certainly an advantage. A constant and prolonged local expression of IFN would surely benefit the anti-HBV treatment by reducing side-effects or by enhancing efficacy. As no obvious IFN induction or toxicity was observed in both in vitro and in vivo, rAAV appears to be a suitable vector in gene transfer or delivery of IFN\u03b11.",

Both the HBsAg and HBeAg levels were significantly decreased by more than five-fold in the culture media. This finding is of prime significance because a minimal dosage has already achieved a similar antiviral effect as a high-dosage (1000 units/ml) of recombinant IFN\u03b3 in Huh6 and HB611 cells [61] . Moreover, such an antiviral effect was equivalent to commercially available IFN\u03b1 (50 000 units/ml), which is isolated from leukocytes and composed of multiple interferon isoforms (see Supplementary Figure S1 ). The drastic decrease (i.e. over ten-fold) of HBsAg, HBeAg, and viral load (i.e. by over 30-fold) in the plasma was another achievement with the use of AAV-IFN\u03b11. Since little effect could be contributed by the animal immune system, IFN\u03b11 might somewhat stimulate other biological mechanisms in vivo that further synergize its antiviral activity. This is because IFNs are capable of acting directly (i.e. against infected cells), and indirectly (i.e. against viral infections by extending the innate and adaptive immune responses), thus boosting the overall antiviral ability [62] .",

            "text": "In recent years, the use of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to target HBV transcripts has became another notable application of AAV vectors [63] . The major advantage of shRNA is that it displays sequence-specific targeting where one can design multiple effective shRNAs to target various transcripts. Previously, our team showed that shRNA displayed synergistic antiviral effects with lamuvidine [54] . However, when rAAV-shRNA was compared with rAAV-IFN\u03b11, the latter offers more advantages. First, IFN\u03b1 is a secreted protein, which could spread from one cell to the other via circulation. Effective antiviral effects could be easily achieved by transducing a portion of liver cells using rAAV-IFN\u03b1 vectors. For shRNAs, they expressed in an intracellular manner, which could not be transferred from one cell to another. This limits its antiviral efficacy and increases the difficulty for gene delivery. The effectiveness of shRNA delivery is one of the major concerns in anti-HBV gene therapy. Second, the efficacy and safety of IFN\u03b1 have been proven clinically for decades, yet these issues remain to be elucidated for microRNA/shRNA. In an animal study, oversaturation of cellular microRNA/shRNA has been shown to lead to fatality in mice. Therefore, safety issues of using microRNA/shRNA based gene therapy are still a concern [50] . Our team has investigated the feasibility of AAV2-shRNA vector for the treatment of HBV. In that study, no obvious liver damage or mortality was observed in nude mice (He et al., unpublished data) . However, off-target shRNAs and the rapid generation of shRNA-resistant mutants [64] raise other concerns with respect to shRNA based gene therapy. Taken together, the advantage of IFN\u03b1 lacking resistance selection gives confidence to the proposed application of rAAV-IFN\u03b11 vector for anti-HBV therapy.",
