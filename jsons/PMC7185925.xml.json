This choice has several implications for mental health workers. First of all, inpatient and outpatient mental health services are recognised by authorities as fundamental services to the community during a global pandemic. Second, given the delay of shared guidelines, individual departments have been challenged to develop an emergency plan within hours.",

First, we recommend closure of second-level and third-level outpatient units (eg, perinatal depression, eating disorders, psychiatry for older people, adult neuropsychiatry, adult autism); for these patients, staff have been doing phone calls and video conference-based visits only for emergencies or specific patient requests. Second, general psychiatry outpatient services should be restricted to urgent visits and patients who require daily administration of medicines or long-acting injectables; on a case-by-case individual revision, physicians are required to re-assess the need for patients to access the service daily and medication assignment on a biweekly or weekly basis is strongly encouraged; visits are limited to those identified as urgent by the patient or physician and frequent, brief telephone updates are encouraged. Third, mental health-care staff (including social workers, rehabilitation technicians, and nurses) are encouraged to actively revise patient charts to identify those with severe mental disorders who are considered to be at increased risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19 (including those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary heart disease).4 These patients should be called via telephone to verify full understanding of the government lockdown procedures and instructed on basic hygiene norms. For those who live with older parents, a clear revision of requirements should be proposed at a time of welfare service restrictions and decreased availability of basic needs such as food. Fourth, patients should be advised to only access the emergency room of the hospital after having discussed alternative possibilities with staff from the outpatient service to follow the lockdown procedure and limit chances of infection.",

Optimisation of shared procedures is mandatory to also limit the potential lack of adherence of some patients with national lockdown indications. The feasibility and effectiveness of online mental health services has been suggested by colleagues who faced the COVID-19 outbreak in China.5 We fully agree that this approach could eventually improve the overall quality of emergency interventions and perhaps increase safety of health-care workers, given the risk of shortages of personal protective equipment.",
