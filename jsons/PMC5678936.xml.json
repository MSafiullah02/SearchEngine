In terms of use of current serological methods, infections can be classified into four broad groups (appendix).

For many infections, however, to distinguish a vaccine-induced antibody response from that which follows natural infection is not possible. Additionally, after an initial successful vaccination, antibody levels might wane to become undetectable. Although these complications preclude simple interpretations of serological assays in the context of vaccination, they are an opportunity to develop new analytical techniques\u2014eg, beyond positive versus negative to a quantitative assessment that might distinguish exposure from infection associated with transmission. Separation of natural and vaccinal immunity would be extremely useful where vaccination coverage is uncertain. However, by contrast with veterinary vaccines,7 this difficult task has not been widely attempted for human infections, and is currently feasible for only a few infections, such as tetanus (infection does not lead to sustained antibody responses) and hepatitis B virus (vaccination only induces antibodies to the surface protein whereas infection also induces antibodies to the core protein). Increasing interest in the development of labelled vaccines is likely to substantially extend this range of infections, especially for newly developed vaccines.",

With these in hand, multiplexing testing to address a range of pathogen questions is a natural extension. Emergent data informs strategies for existing public health interventions, but could also contribute to help prioritise the launch of new vaccines. Successful templates for this approach were provided when prevalence of hepatitis surface antigen was used as an indicator of disease burden,8 and age-specific prevalence of rubella antibody was used to estimate burden of congenital rubella syndrome.9 Serological surveys in sentinel areas (focal areas for surveillance) could allow strategic deployment of vaccination or other interventions, maximising use of resources and timely intervention to benefit the entire population. For areas where immunity against a pathogen wanes, age profiles of serology can give insights into the rates of both waning and boosting of immunity from exposure to the infection (protective titres need to be known). Additional data availability would enable increased methodological research into both these inferential questions, and the connected question of translating age prevalence of infection into transmission intensity.",

If these questions can be addressed, serum banks for broad multipathogen targeting could be used to address various public health priorities, such as success of mass drug administration for neglected tropical diseases.10 A combination of laboratory innovations (eg, automation, to circumvent laborious individual analyses) and analytical innovations are likely to be needed.
