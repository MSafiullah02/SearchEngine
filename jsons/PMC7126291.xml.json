In addition, the large number (>100) of known HRV serotypes makes vaccine development difficult.3 Clinical treatments are directed toward relief of the most prominent symptoms of each clinical syndrome.

In fact, SARS 3CLpro inhibitors were developed by modifying rupintrivir18 and common inhibitors with IC50 values in the micromolar range were recently identified for both picornavirus 3Cpro and coronavirus 3CLpro using high-throughput screening.19, 20 The pyridinyl thiophene ester 5 was discovered by screening a small molecule library (50,000 molecules) and has significant inhibitory activity against both HAV 3Cpro and SARS 3CLpro (IC50\n = 0.5 \u03bcM).19, 21 Further work on a series of heteroaromatic esters resulted in the discovery of the most potent ester 6, inhibiting SARS 3CLpro with an IC50 of 30 nM and an antiviral activity (EC50 value) of 6.9 \u03bcM.22 Another analog, 7, also showed potent inhibition of HAV 3Cpro with an IC50 of 53 nM.23 Studies on the inhibitory and molecular docking mechanisms of heteroaromatic esters have shown that the 5-halopyridine moiety is crucial in binding to the S1 pocket, because both 3Cpro and 3CLpro show high specificity for Gln as the P1 residue.23\n",

Commercially available hydroxy-heteroaromatic rings were esterified with 2-furoyl chloride in pyridine and CH2Cl2 (7\u201318).

In a rigid receptor structure, random orientations of ligand conformations were subjected to simulated annealing molecular dynamics. Final minimized poses of docked ligand were sorted by CHARMm energy (interaction energy plus ligand strain). Mass spectrometry and HPLC studies have already revealed the inhibition mechanism of heteroaromatic esters acting in the active site of SARS 3CLpro,\n20, 22 Such esters initially bind competitively and strongly to the active site, being recognized by S1 pocket. The carbonyl carbon is then attacked by the nucleophilic Cys residue, and become covalently connected with the protease prior to eventual release. Thus in our study, possible prehydrolysis-binding complex models of 7 was generated (Fig. 2\n). The lone pair electron of nitrogen moiety of 5-bromopyridine in 7 occupies the S1 binding pocket, forming a hydrogen bond with N\u03b52 of His161 (3.1 \u00c5). The bromo group occupies S1 pocket near the protein surface and, notably, a hydrogen bond with the \u2013NH of Gly166 (3.0 \u00c5) was observed, explaining the importance of the presence of a halogen group on the pyridine ring. The ester carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the \u2013NH of Gly164 (2.5 \u00c5). This predicted binding model is consistent with the binding mode of halopyridinyl esters to SARS 3CLpro and HAV 3Cpro.",

Although there is different spatial position of the 4-quinolinone carbonyl oxygen of 19 from the pyridyl nitrogen of 7, the requirement of hydrogen bond angle between the carbonyl oxygen and N\u03b52 of His161 was satisfied with the ideal hydrogen bond at 30\u201360\u00b0 to the O\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC axis within 30\u00b0 of the carbonyl plane, while the sp2 lone pair of pyridyl nitrogen of 7 is lying toward N\u03b52 of His161 forming optimal hydrogen bond angle (180\u00b0).

Compound 12\u201316 with additional hydrogen bond acceptor at 2-position of the pyridine ring might disturb the optimal hydrogen bond of the pyridyl nitrogen showing the less interaction energies (\u221219.9 kcal/mol to \u221223.5 kcal/mol). Although weak inhibitors of benzamide analogs, 17\u201318 could form hydrogen bonds with His161 (\u221224.2 kcal/mol for 17, \u221222.6 kcal/mol for 18), the distance between ester carbonyl carbon and the nucleophilic \u2013SH group of Cys might be changed unfavorably resulting in weak or no inhibitory activity.",
