And oral preparations of Flos Lonicerae extract are usually more accepted for patients than injections owing to their elimination of pain and discomfort, and lower costs to produce oral formulations, but their clinical effect was unsatisfactory compared with that of injections, which becomes one of the most limited points in the development of Chinese medicine preparations. The presumptions that whether the low bioavailability of oral Flos Lonicerae extract resulted in the poor efficacy or whether efficacy could be improved as the absorption of active ingredients in Flos Lonicerae extract was enhanced are all yet to be investigated.",

According to the HPLC figureprint profile shown in Fig. 1(A) and UPLC\u2013MS/MS shown in Fig. 1(B), we found that the contents of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid or 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid were about 16.1, 16.9, 16.6, 18.9 and 37.8 mg/ml, respectively, higher largely than that of other ingredients, but their absolute bioavailability orally was significantly low (unpublished). Besides, the content of flavones such as galuteolin was 0.335 mg/ml, lower than that of phenolic acids such as isochlorogenic, and we also found that about 100% of the apically loaded hyperin, galuteolin, rutin were retained on the apical side from Caco-2 cell transport (unpublished). Conceptually, all compounds in the pharmaceutical product that are bioavailable in the systemic circulation can be considered as relevant active markers for pharmacological effects. Therefore, the properties above of main ingredients in Flos Lonicerae extract led us to postulate that low bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract might result in low efficacy of clinical therapy.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) donors and polyamines were also effective for improving the intestinal absorption of poorly absorbable drugs (Fetih et al. 2005). However, some absorption enhancers can cause damage and irritate the intestinal mucosal membranes. This is a limiting factor for their clinical use. Indeed, there existed almost linear relationship between the effectiveness of various absorption enhancers and their membrane toxicity reported by Yamamoto et al. (1996). Therefore, the absorption enhancers based on tight junctions with high effectiveness and low mucosal toxicity need to be investigated.",

The ability of chitosan to enhance gastrointestinal (GI) drug absorption has been of special interest (Gao et al. 2008). Illum et al. (1994) proposed that the mechanism of absorption enhancement was a combination of mucoadhesion and a loosening effect on the tension of the tight junctions through ionic interactions with negatively charged groups of glycocalix. However, the polymer was only soluble in an acidic environment in which the pH was less or if the order of the pK\na value of chitosan (5.5\u20136.5), which restricted its application to the absorption enhancer seriously. For example, the reduction of TEER of Caco-2 cell monolayers was found after the apical incubation with chitosan hydrochloride and chitosan glutamate at a pH of 6.20, but no decrease of TEER, which is a good measurement of the tightness of the junctions between the cells, was observed at a pH of 7.40. At this pH, both chitosan salts (hydrochloride, glutamate) did not form clear solutions. In agreement with the results of the TEER experiments, no increase in the transport of the hydrophilic model compound [14C]-mannitol was found at a pH of 7.40 after incubation with these chitosan salts (Jonker et al. 2002). Therefore, the potential use of chitosans, as absorption enhancer in the more basic environments of intestine, was limited.",

However, the difference of antiviral activity between Flos Lonicerae extract with or without COS was significant from Fig. 7(B). The inhibition rate of Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg was higher than that of without COS, which indicated that the pharmacological effects such as antiviral effect of Flos Lonicerae extract could be significantly improved by addition of COS.",

Among these peaks, phenolic acids and flavonoids aglycone containing 12 peaks also appeared in the MS spectra of Flos Lonicerae extract, indicating that these components may be absorbed into the rat plasma in the original form. The result was consistent with the previous report that flavonoids glucoside like galuteolin, luteolin-7-o-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-o--\u03b2-d-galactoside, hyperin, hyperoside and rutin cannot be well absorbed into Caco-2 cell, which suggested that most of flavonoids glycosides needed to be transformed into flavonoids aglycone, and then be absorbed into the plasma Fig. 8\n, and the real active ingredients in flavonoids may be flavonoids aglycone, not flavonoids glycosides. However, flavonoids glycosides in vivo can not be quantitative assessed well illustrated by Fig. 8. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 7, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS improves MDCK cell viability better after influenza virus propagation. All evidence above supporting the hypothesis that phenolic acid can be considered as one of the important marker compounds to control the pharmacology of Flos Lonicerae extract.",
