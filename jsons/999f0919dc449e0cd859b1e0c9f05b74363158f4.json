Experiments were therefore conducted to delineate the rate limiting step(s) involved, using a phage vector that contains a mammalian luciferase reporter gene cassette. The efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells was quantitated, in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of cell uptake and degradation pathways. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and proteasome inhibitors strongly enhanced phage-mediated luciferase expression, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the destruction of intracellular phage particles. In contrast, inhibition of endosome acidification had no effect on phage-mediated gene transfer, presumably because phage lambda is tolerant to extended exposure to low pH. These findings provide insights into the pathways by which phage vectors enter and transduce mammalian cells, and suggest that it may be possible to pharmacologically enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells.

In other cases, proteasomal activity has been found to inhibit virus infection-as exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Douar et al., 2001; Jennings et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 1998; Tang, Sambanis, and Sibley, 2005; Wu et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2004) . The fact that proteasomal activity also restricted phage-mediated gene transfer suggests a previously unappreciated similarity in the postentry events that regulate cellular transduction by bacteriophage vectors and mammalian viral vectors such as AAV. It remains uncertain, however, whether proteasomal inhibition promotes the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer because its interferes with proteasomally-mediated degradation of intracellular phage particles or because it alters their intracellular trafficking, perhaps shunting them from late to recycling endosomes (Ding et al., 2006; Khor, McElroy, and Whittaker, 2003) .

Lysosomal proteases degrade exogenous proteins that have entered the cell through the endosomal pathway (Mego, 1984; Wibo and Poole, 1974) , and might be expected to mediate the destruction of intracellular viruses. In fact, however, many animal viruses have successfully usurped these enzymes, and exploit them in their life cycle. Examples include AAV, coronaviruses (including the causative agent of SARS), filoviruses (such as Ebola virus), reoviruses and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus type-1) (Akache et al., 2007; Chandran et al., 2005; Ebert et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2004; Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002; Moriuchi, Moriuchi, and Fauci, 2000; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Qiu et al., 2006; Schornberg et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . All of these viruses rely on lysosomal proteases to facilitate their uncoating and/or to activate viral fusion proteins (Akache et al., 2007; Chandran et al., 2005; Ebert et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2004; Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002; Moriuchi, Moriuchi, and Fauci, 2000; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Qiu et al., 2006; Schornberg et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . In contrast to these animal viruses, inhibition of the lysosomal proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L resulted in more efficient cellular transduction by bacteriophage lambda. This indicates that lysosomal proteases negatively regulate the transduction of mammalian cells by phage lambda, presumably because they degrade internalized phage particles that are unable to escape the endolysosomal compartment. Consistent with this, direct exposure of lambda phage capsids to purified cathepsin L resulted in a significant decrease in phage infectivity, and loss of capsid integrity (Fig. 9) . It is therefore interesting to note that MG132, in addition to inhibiting the 26S proteasome complex, also inhibits cathepsins (LaLonde et al., 1998) ; it is possible that this may contribute to its potent effects on phage- Fig. 12 . Model of lambda phage entry and intracellular transport in mammalian cells. Lambda phage particles likely enter mammalian cells via a non-specific macropinocytotic uptake mechanism (Lankes et al., 2007) (A), and enter early endosomes (B). The phage-containing endosomes then either (i) undergo acidification and fusion with lysosomes, resulting in the degradation of phage particles by lysosomal proteases (C) or (ii) undergo lysis or recycling (Ding et al., 2006) (D) , resulting in entry of the phage particles into the cytoplasm (E). Inhibition of lysosomal proteases results in stabilization of phage within lysosomes, allowing some phage particles to escape from this compartment and enter the cytoplasm (denoted by the dotted arrow; F). The majority of lambda phage particles within the cytosol undergo proteasomally-mediated degradation (G), but a fraction of the particles successfully uncoat and deliver their genomic payload to the nucleus, resulting in the expression of phage-encoded genes (i.e., the luciferase reporter gene in our vector constructs) (H). mediated gene transfer (Figs. 1 and 2) . The hypothesis that lysosomal proteases degrade intracellular lambda phage particles is consistent with the synergistic effect of proteasome plus lysosomal protease blockade on phage-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 8) and suggests that it may be possible to use pharmacologic methods to significantly enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 260, "text": "(Mego, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 261, "end": 282, "text": "Wibo and Poole, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 655, "end": 676, "text": "(Akache et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 677, "end": 699, "text": "Chandran et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 700, "end": 719, "text": "Ebert et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 720, "end": 740, "text": "Golden et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 741, "end": 768, "text": "Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 769, "end": 805, "text": "Moriuchi, Moriuchi, and Fauci, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 806, "end": 828, "text": "Pager and Dutch, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 829, "end": 846, "text": "Qiu et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 847, "end": 871, "text": "Schornberg et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 872, "end": 893, "text": "Simmons et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1037, "text": "(Akache et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1060, "text": "Chandran et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1080, "text": "Ebert et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1101, "text": "Golden et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1129, "text": "Jane-Valbuena et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1166, "text": "Moriuchi, Moriuchi, and Fauci, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1189, "text": "Pager and Dutch, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1207, "text": "Qiu et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1232, "text": "Schornberg et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1254, "text": "Simmons et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1997, "text": "(LaLonde et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2284, "text": "(Lankes et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2550, "text": "(Ding et al., 2006) (D)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1837, "end": 1845, "text": "(Fig. 9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2079, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3189, "text": "(Figs. 1 and 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3398, "end": 3406, "text": "(Fig. 8)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In contrast to the proteasome and lysosomal proteases, endosomal acidification had minimal effect on the efficiency of gene transduction by our lambda phage vectors.
