            "text": "Primary structure is defined as the linear amino acid sequence of a protein's polypeptide chain. In fact, the term protein sequence is often used interchangeably with primary structure. In 1973, Chris Anfinsen demonstrated that the primary amino sequence of a protein uniquely determines the higher orders of structure for a protein and is thus of fundamental importance (Anfinsen, 1973). It is noteworthy, however, that changes in the local biological environment of a protein molecule can sometimes perturb its three\u2010dimensional structure. For example, interactions with ligands, substrates, or other proteins can bring about controlled conformational changes producing potentially profound effects. Furthermore, a few proteins have been found to have intrinsically unstructured regions (Wright and Dyson, 1999; Tompa, 2002). Hence, although structural uniqueness associated with a protein sequence is a powerful principle, it can sometimes depend on the local environment and is not rigidly followed in every case.",

Small proteins may contain a single domain, whereas larger proteins often contain multiple domains. A fold refers to a characteristic spatial assembly of secondary structure elements into a domain\u2010like structure that is common to many different proteins. Particular folds are often, though not always, related to a certain function (e.g., nucleotide\u2010binding folds). A structural motif is similar to a fold, but is generally smaller, tending to form the building blocks of folds. Some structural motifs (e.g., \u03b2\u2010barrels) are observed in a vast array of unrelated proteins with many variations, while others, especially those related to a unique biochemical function (e.g., zinc fingers; see Zinc\u2010Containing DNA\u2010Binding Motifs), are highly conserved, generally occurring in protein domains of similar function. Highly conserved structural motifs often display a characteristic signature at their amino acid sequence level, the so\u2010called sequence motif. Very often the term motif is used alone to refer to either a structural motif or a sequence motif. This can lead to confusion since structural motifs do not always have a unique amino acid signature. It is important to note that the terms domain, fold, and motif are often used interchangeably with blurred distinctions. This happens especially for larger, highly conserved structural motifs which may be as equally well known as a particular type of domain or fold.",

            "text": "\nHelix bundles (or helical bundles) usually refer to the packing of several helices in a nearly parallel or antiparallel orientation. In some cases the term also applies to the general packing of helices regardless of their orientation to each other. There are many examples of protein structures that contain three\u2010, four\u2010, or multiple\u2010helix bundles, such as cyclin (three\u2010helix bundle), hematopoietic cytokines (four\u2010helix bundle), globins (six\u2010helix bundle), and cytochrome c oxidase (22\u2010helix bundle). Helix bundles are often distinguished by the number of helices in the bundle, the relative direction of the helices, and the characteristic twist of each helix bundle. In describing the direction of the helices in a bundle, both parallel/antiparallel and up/down terminologies are used in the literature, although the latter terms give a more precise description (Fig. 1F). In the first convention, two helices are said to be parallel if their N\u2010 to C\u2010terminal vectors, or peptide directions, are parallel to each other (i.e., pointing in the same direction). The opposite is referred to as antiparallel. In the up/down notation, the first helix in a bundle is defined as the \u2018up\u2019 helix, and all subsequent helices are assigned either \u2018up\u2019 or \u2018down\u2019 depending on whether they are parallel or antiparallel, respectively, to the first helix. In most helical bundles, the axes of individual helices are inclined to the representative axis of the entire bundle in a systematic manner, forming a twist with defined handedness that resembles a spiral. Most helix bundles carry a left\u2010handed twist.",

Ring closure usually occurs with the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal \u03b2\u2010strands coming together within the final propeller blade in an association sometimes referred to as \u2018molecular Velcro\u2019. \u03b2\u2010propeller functions vary widely and include enzymatic catalysis (e.g., collagenase, galactose oxidase, sialidase), ligand binding (e.g., tachylectin\u20102, haemopexin), signaling (e.g., seven\u2010bladed G protein \u03b2\u2010subunit), protein\u2010protein interaction (e.g., integrin extracellular segment), and scaffolding functions (e.g., constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) protein). Well known repeating sequence motifs observed in \u03b2\u2010propeller proteins include the WD motif (also called WD40), the kelch motif, the RCC1 repeat, the TolB repeat, the YWTD repeat, the aspartate box, the tachylectin\u20102 repeat, and the tryptophan docking motif (Fulop and Jones, 1999).",

The individual alignments, complete with RasMol links (see above) to view three\u2010dimensional superpositions, color\u2010coded sequence alignments, and various alignment statistics such as the root mean square deviation (RMSD), Z\u2010scores, and percent sequence identity, are available on the web. These structural comparisons are used in a hierarchical clustering procedure to create a fold tree within FSSP for the classification of protein structures. A Z\u2010score cutoff of \u22652 is used to define individual folds at the top of the hierarchy. Subsequent Z\u2010score cutoffs of 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 are used to designate further classification levels with increasing structural similarity. Moreover, another database, referred to as a supplement to FSSP and called the Dali Domain Dictionary (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/domain), has recently been built in a very similar manner but focuses on protein domains rather than whole proteins (Dietmann and Holm, 2001).",

In recent years, however, with the rapid growth of sequence and structure knowledge, many other proteins whose functions are not related to immunoglobulins have nonetheless been found to contain one or more Ig\u2010like domains in their tertiary structures. Examples of such proteins include the cell surface glycoprotein receptors such as growth hormone receptor, CD4 and CD8, adhesion molecules such as cadherins and type III fibronectins, class I and class II major histocompatibility proteins, chaperone protein PapD, the transcriptional factor NF\u2010\u03baB, and even some enzymes such as Cu and Zn superoxide dismutase and \u03b2\u2010galactosidase. The discovery of the Ig\u2010like domains in many proteins not only broadens the definition of superfamily, but more importantly, demonstrates the versatility of the fold and the ability of these domains to function as modular units in many diverse systems.",

            "text": "The immunoglobulin fold is defined as a domain that is formed from seven to nine \u03b2\u2010strands folded into a Greek key \u03b2\u2010sandwich (Fig. 2; also see above). The topology consists of one \u03b2\u2010sheet formed by strands A, B, E, and D, while the opposing sheet is formed by strands C, C\u2032, and occasionally C\u2033, as well as F and G. Based on the strand hydrogen\u2010bonding pattern and the number of strands in each domain, the superfamily is further divided into five commonly observed subclasses: V, C1, C2, I, and E (Fig. 2). The V\u2010type domain has the same topology as immunoglobulin variable (V) regions. It has nine strands with a typical strand switch occurring in the first strand, which usually breaks into two halves (A and A\u2032) with the first half (strand A) hydrogen bonding to strand B of the B\u2010E\u2010D \u03b2\u2010sheet and the second half (strand A\u2032) hydrogen bonding to strand G of the opposing \u03b2\u2010sheet. Strands C\u2032 and C\u2033 are usually shorter than the other strands. In immunoglobulins, the antigen binding site is composed primarily of three loop regions termed complementary determining regions (CDRs). They are located between strands B and C, C\u2032 and C\u2033, and F and G. The C1 type of immunoglobulin fold refers to the topology observed in the structure of constant regions of immunoglobulins. It has seven strands, of which strands A\u2010B\u2010E\u2010D form one \u03b2\u2010sheet and strands C\u2010F\u2010G form the other. Most members of the C2\u2010type subclass have seven strands and differ from the C1 type by a simple switch whereby strand D hydrogen bonds with strand C in the C\u2010F\u2010G sheet rather than strand E in the A\u2010B\u2010E sheet. Hence strand D is labeled C\u2032 in the C2\u2010type subclass. Some members of the C2 family also have additional strands at either the N or C termini. Based on tertiary structure similarities, there are two frequently adopted tertiary folds in the C2 class; one is similar to the C2 domain of T\u2010lymphocyte cell surface glycoproteins CD2 and CD4, while the other is similar to the fibronectin type III domain, and hence is also referred to as the fibronectin type III\u2010like fold, shown as C2(Fn) in Figure 2C. The I\u2010type domains closely resemble the topology of immunoglobulin\u2010variable domains except that they lack strands C\u2032 and C\u2033. The members of the I\u2010type subclass also have the characteristic strand switching phenomena in the first strand, as do the immunoglobulin variable domains. The E\u2010type immunoglobulin domains also present a topology similar to those of the V type with the difference being the lack of C\u2033 and D strands. Table 1 summarizes all the observed immunoglobulin subclasses.",

In addition to MHC molecules, the structures of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), hereditary haemochromatosis protein HFE, MHC\u2010I chain homolog (MIC), UL16 binding protein (ULBP), and Rae\u20101 have all been shown to contain an MHC\u2010like fold (Radaev et al. 2001b; Boyington and Sun, 2002). MHC molecules are heterodimers consisting of an \u03b1/\u03b2 peptide\u2010binding domain and two Ig C1\u2010type domains (Fig. 3). In class I MHC molecules, the peptide\u2010binding \u03b11\u03b12 domain and the \u03b13 Ig domain reside on one chain (the heavy chain), while the second Ig domain is contributed by an associated \u03b22m molecule (Fig. 3A). Class II MHC molecules consist of an \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain (Fig. 3B). The N\u2010terminal part of each chain contributes to half of the peptide\u2010binding domain and the C\u2010terminal half of each chain provides a single Ig domain. The MHC Ig domains all have Ig C1\u2010type folds (see Immunoglobulins and Immunoglobulin\u2010Like Superfamilies). In class I MHC molecules, the peptide\u2010binding domain is formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b12 regions of the heavy chain whereas in class II molecules it is formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b21 regions of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. The peptide\u2010binding domain consists of two \u03b1\u2010helices (one from each region), forming the two sides of the groove and an eight\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (four strands from each region), forming the floor of the groove (Fig. 3C). The size of the groove is \u223c30 \u00c5 long and 12 \u00c5 wide in the middle. Both class I and II MHC molecules bind peptides in extended conformations with anchor residues buried inside pockets of the groove. The distribution of these pockets along the binding site determines the peptide selectivity of a particular allele of class I or class II molecules. Class I MHC molecules are restricted to binding peptides of 8 to 11 residues, whereas class II MHC molecules bind longer peptides of 15 to 24 residues. In contrast, none of the MHC\u2010like proteins, such as FcRn, HFE, MICs, ULBPs, and Rae\u20101s associate with peptides. Their putative peptide\u2010binding grooves are narrower or even closed compared to the MHC peptide\u2010binding groove (Table 1).",

These modules are present in tandem arrays in many complement regulatory proteins in addition to a number of cell surface proteins. Three\u2010dimensional structures have been determined for the fifth, fifteenth, and sixteenth CCP domains of factor H, CCP modules 3 and 4 of a Vaccinia virus complement control protein mimic, and CCP modules 1 and 2 from the complement cofactor CD46 (Table 2; Norman et al., 1991; Barlow et al., 1992, 1993; Wiles et al., 1997; Casasnovas et al., 1999). The domain structure consists of an elongated, twisted \u03b2\u2010sandwich formed from a three\u2010 or four\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet and a two\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (Fig. 4E). Although the known structures of SCR modules all have essentially the same backbone fold, differences in the number of \u03b2 strands between various modules arise from differences in hydrogen bonding patterns. Structures containing two tandem CCPs show an elongated head to tail arrangement with elbow angles that vary significantly from structure to structure.",

These proteins share very little sequence homology. Nevertheless, they all have an unusual arrangement of six cysteines that are disulfide linked to form a knotted conformation and this core structure, the cystine\u2010knot, is flanked by four strands of an antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (McDonald et al., 1991; Oefner et al., 1992; Daopin et al., 1993; Schlunegger and Grutter, 1993; Lapthorn et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1994). Fig. 6B shows the crystal structure of human TGF\u2010\u03b22 with the common flanking \u03b2\u2010strands (1, 2, 3, and 4) shown in green and the six disulfide\u2010linked cysteines shown in ball\u2010and\u2010stick models. Outside the four structurally conserved \u03b2\u2010strands, the helices and loops observed in the structure of TGF\u2010\u03b22 are not conserved in NGF, PDGF, and hCG. The three disulfide bonds are formed between the six cysteines of TGF\u2010\u03b22 as follows: Cys 15\u2013Cys 78, Cys 44\u2013Cys 109, and Cys 48\u2013Cys 111, creating a linkage pattern of I\u2013IV, II\u2013V, and III\u2013VI among the six cysteines. A topological knot is formed by threading disulfide I\u2013IV through a ring formed with disulfides II\u2013V and III\u2013VI as its two sides, and the peptides in between cystine II and III, and V and VI as its other two sides. Another common structural feature among the cystine\u2010knot cytokines is that the active forms of these proteins are always dimers, either homo\u2010 or heterodimers; however, despite the overall topological similarity between the monomers, each family of growth factors form their own distinct dimers with a unique dimer interface that is characteristic to each family of growth factors.",

Examples of proteins with SH2 domains include protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), phosphatases (PTPases), a subunit of phospholipase C (PLC\u2010\u03b31), the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol\u20103OH kinase, the cytoplasmic tail of cell surface receptor proteins, and adaptor proteins like Grb2; however, as of this writing, the total number of SH2\u2010containing proteins is well over 1100 according to the SMART database (see Web\u2010Based Structural Bioinformatics and http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/browse.shtml).",

Initially identified by Hofmann and Bucher (1995) in the family of forkhead\u2010associated transcription factors, this domain has since been found on over 400 different proteins (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/browse.shtml). In addition to recognizing phosphothreonine, some FHA domains are reported to bind phosphotyrosine (Liao et al., 1999; Wang et al. 2000a) or even unphosphorylated peptides (Li et al. 2002a).

EVH1 domains of \u223c115 residues are widely present in eukaryotic species from fungi to mammals and are generally part of large multidomain proteins.

EVH1 domains function by recognizing and targeting ligands containing the polyproline consensus sequence Phe\u2010Pro\u2010Pro\u2010Pro\u2010Pro; however, based on ligand specificity, EVH1 domains can be divided into class I proteins that recognize the sequence Phe\u2010Pro\u2010X\u2010\u03a6\u2010Pro, (X represents any residue and \u03a6 represents a hydrophobic residue) and class II proteins that recognize the sequence Pro\u2010Pro\u2010X\u2010X\u2010Phe (Ball et al., 2002).

The majority bind membrane phospholipids in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner; however, not all require Ca2+ and some domains bind proteins as well. The structure of C2 domains consists of \u223c130 residues folded into an eight\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sandwich with topologies resembling an Ig fold (Fig. 10C and Fig. 2, respectively; Sutton et al., 1995; Grobler and Hurley, 1997).

The rest of the topology is identical between various C2 domains. Three variable loops at one end of the domain, referred to as Ca2+\u2010binding regions (CBRs), are intimately involved in the binding of two to three Ca2+ ions and in phospholipid binding. Interestingly, the CBRs also correspond topologically to the complementarity\u2010determining regions (CDRs) of the variable domains of antibodies. Structure\u2010function studies of C2 domains from PKC\u03b1 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) have shown that the two bound Ca2+ ions in each C2 domain play distinct roles: one provides a bridge between the C2 domain and anionic phospholipids, whereas the second Ca2+ induces a conformational change that enhances membrane\u2010protein interactions (Cho, 2001; Stahelin and Cho, 2001).",

The Habc domain can complex with the SNARE domain (referred to as H3 in this context), induce helical structure, and form a four\u2010helix bundle (Munson et al., 2000). This is referred to as a closed SNARE conformation and inhibits complex formation with other SNAREs. Syntaxin appears to exist in equilibrium between open and closed forms. Regulatory proteins such as nSec1 can perturb this equilibrium by binding to the closed conformation, thereby stabilizing it and preventing SNARE complex formation. The crystal structure of yeast syntaxin Sso1p (H3Habc; Munson et al., 2000) shows the H3 helix is very similar in structure to the comparative helix in a SNARE complex, although its orientations with neighboring helices is strikingly different. Curiously, the crystal structure of the nSec1/syntaxin 1a complex (Misura et al., 2000b) reveals the H3 domain adopting an irregular bent helical structure distinct from that of the SNARE complex.

Smads are divided into three classes: comediator Smads (Co\u2010Smads), receptor regulated Smads (R\u2010Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I\u2010Smads). Both the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal domains of Smads are conserved across species and connected by a variable linker region (L\u2010domain). The N\u2010terminal domain (MH1) interacts with DNA, whereas the C\u2010terminal MH2 domain is involved in phosphorylation\u2010regulated homo\u2010 and hetero\u2010oligomerization among Smads as well as interaction with other proteins in the signaling pathway. The fold of the MH2 domain comprises a twisted antiparallel \u03b2 sandwich made from five\u2010 and six\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheets capped at one end by a three\u2010helix bundle pointing away from the sandwich, and capped at the other end by a three large loops and a helix (Fig. 11E; Shi et al., 1997).

The SMART database reports nearly 400 proteins containing ARM repeats (see Web\u2010Based Structural Bioinformatics and http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/browse.shtml). The crystal structures of \u03b2\u2010catenin and karyopherin \u03b1 (importin \u03b1) revealed stacking of repeats to form three ladders of parallel helices arranged in a superhelical structure (Fig. 12C; Conti et al., 1998; Huber et al., 1997). The superhelical twist is formed by an \u223c30\u00b0 rotation of each repeat from its neighbors. Within individual repeats, the antiparallel helices H2 and H3 have orientations similar to helices A and B of HEAT repeats. Helix H1, however, is smaller and lies perpendicular to the H2/H3 pair. H3 and its flanking loops are observed to form a groove lined with conserved residues along the entire length of the ARM repeat structure. The structure of \u03b2\u2010catenin complexed with the cytoplasmic domain of E\u2010cadherin provides a striking example of how this groove can be used for protein recognition (Huber and Weis, 2001). In the complex, the C\u2010terminal 100 residues of cadherin bind in a predominantly extended conformation along the entire length of the H3 groove of \u03b2\u2010catenin.

These proteins play numerous roles directly regulating and participating in a diverse array of signal transduction cascades. PKs can be broadly categorized as tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases; however, a comprehensive classification system was published in 1995 based primarily on sequence homology (Hanks and Hunter, 1995). This classification has recently been expanded to include a total of seven major groups of PK families (Manning et al. 2002a, 2002b). Tyrosine kinases (TK) comprise one group and include both membrane\u2010spanning receptors, such as the insulin receptor, and cytosolic proteins, such as Src kinases. The Ser/Thr kinases comprise six main groups. The AGC group includes cyclic nucleotide\u2010regulated PKs and diacylglyceride\u2010regulated/phospholipid\u2010dependent PKs (PKC), among others. The CaMK group consists of calcium/calmodulin\u2010dependent PKs. The CMGC group includes cyclin\u2010dependent PKs, mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, glycogen synthase kinase\u20103, and casein kinase\u2010II. The STE grouping includes several MAPK cascade families. The CK1 group comprises CK1, tau tubulin kinase (TTBK), and vaccinia related kinase (VRK) families.

Finally, more than a dozen atypical protein kinases (aPKs) have been identified that are reported to have protein kinase activity, but have no sequence homology with the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (Manning et al., 2002b).",

            "text": "\nProtein kinase catalytic domain. Despite the diversity of this superfamily, structural studies have consistently revealed a structurally conserved core fold for the catalytic domain of eukaryotic protein kinases. Other modular domains (e.g., SH2, SH3, PH, SAM, C2, and PDZ domains, to name a few) are sometimes fused to the catalytic domain for regulatory or localizing purposes. First elucidated in the crystal structure of cyclic AMP\u2010dependent protein kinase (also known as PKA; Knighton et al., 1991), the bilobal protein kinase fold consists of an N\u2010terminal lobe (N\u2010lobe) comprising a five\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet with a flanking \u03b1\u2010helix and a larger C\u2010terminal, primarily \u03b1\u2010helical lobe (C\u2010lobe) of eight to ten \u03b1 helices and some short \u03b2\u2010strands (Fig. 13A). The active site is located between the lobes with the N\u2010lobe contributing an ATP\u2010binding glycine\u2010rich loop and the C\u2010lobe providing most of the protein\u2010substrate\u2010binding site. An activation loop in the C\u2010lobe contains one or more phosphorylation sites that help activate the enzyme when phosphorylated. Although the topology and core catalytic domain structures are well conserved across this large superfamily, there are some noticeable differences among various members. These include additions and deletions of secondary structure elements, changes in the orientation of secondary structure elements, N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal extensions, and variations in the relative orientation between the N\u2010 and C\u2010lobes. Some of these structural differences appear to correspond to the sequence\u2010based classifications of PKs discussed above. Noteworthy variations include a 25\u2010 to 30\u2010residue insertion between helices G and H (PKA nomenclature) in the CMGC protein kinases (e.g., cyclin\u2010dependent and MAP kinases) and the extra helix C observed in the cAMP\u2010dependent protein kinases. Two atypical protein kinases, the transient receptor potential (TRP) Ca2+\u2010channel kinase (also referred to as ChaK or TRP\u2010PLIK) domain (Yamaguchi et al., 2001) and the actin\u2010fragmin kinase (Steinbacher et al., 1999) have been found to share significant structural homology with the eukaryotic PK superfamily members despite a lack of sequence similarity; however, the structurally homologous region in these enzymes is smaller, comprising most of the N\u2010lobe but only the N\u2010terminal portion\u2014i.e., helices D and E (PKA nomenclature) and the following \u03b2\u2010strands\u2014of the C\u2010lobe. The rest of the C\u2010lobe consists largely of \u03b1\u2010helices that do not correspond to those in the PK superfamily. Furthermore, actin\u2010fragmin kinase has an extra two\u2010helix insertion in the N\u2010lobe, and the C\u2010lobe of ChaK has a bound zinc atom that is sequestered from solvent.",

            "text": "\nSrc family kinases. The structure of src tyrosine kinases is briefly discussed here as a special case to illustrate how SH2 and SH3 domains are used in cis to regulate and localize protein kinase activity. Most src family tyrosine kinases share a common architecture comprising four Src homology (SH) regions in addition to a variable region. The N\u2010terminal SH4 region contains a myristylation signal required for attachment to the membrane, followed by a variable region that may localize the enzyme more specifically. The subsequent SH3 and SH2 domains bind proline\u2010rich targets and certain phosphotyrosine motifs respectively (for more information, see SH2 Domains and SH3 Domains, respectively). These two domains are involved in both regulation of the enzymatic activity and subcellular localization of the kinase. The catalytic activity of the kinase is found in the C\u2010terminal SH1 region. A short segment C\u2010terminal to the SH1 domain contains a tyrosine residue that inactivates the kinase when phosphorylated. Similar to other protein kinases, phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the activation loop increases activity of the kinase. The crystal structure of inactive haematopoietic cell kinase (Hck; Sicheri et al., 1997) includes the SH2, SH3, and catalytic domain of the enzyme, while the structures of the catalytic domains alone have been determined for lymphoid cell kinase (Lck) in its activated form (Yamaguchi and Hendrickson, 1996) and C\u2010terminal Src kinase (Csk) in its inactive form (Lamers et al., 1999). The Hck crystal structure shows the SH2 domain interacting with a C\u2010terminal phosphotyrosine and the SH3 domain bound to the linker region between the SH2 and kinase domains, effectively locking the kinase in an inactive state (Fig. 13B). Despite the fact that both the SH3 and SH2 domains are located distal to the active site of the kinase, their intramolecular interactions in the inactive form results in positioning helix C of the N\u2010lobe such that the orientation of a key residue in the active site is disrupted.",

The \u03b2\u2010sheet has a strand order of 2\u20101\u20103\u20104. Subtype II PTPs have a central highly curved five\u2010 or ten\u2010stranded mixed \u03b2\u2010sheet sandwiched between four to seven helices on one side and one or two on the other (Fig. 13D). Unlike subtype I, the strand order for the central parallel strands of this \u03b2\u2010sheet is 1\u20104\u20102\u20103. Subtype II PTPs include the so\u2010called high\u2010molecular\u2010weight PTPs such as PTB1, Yersinia PTP, and SHP\u20101 and \u20102, in addition to the smaller DSPs such as VHR, MAP kinase phosphatase, kinase\u2010associated phosphatase (KAP), and tumor suppressor PTEN (Table 5).

Interestingly, CDC25 has the same fold as the sulfurtransferases rhodanase, GlpE, and the ERK2\u2010binding domain of MAPK phosphatase\u20103. Although the topologies of these protein phosphatase subtypes are different, the active site strand\u2010loop\u2010helix regions show a striking structural similarity, and they all feature an essential nucleophilic cysteine residue located in a cleft between the \u03b2\u2010sheet and the larger helical bundle.",

Apart from the DNA\u2010binding motifs, the structures of GAL4 and PPR1 are rather different from each other. The linker region in each monomer of GAL4 is completely extended, making practically no contacts with the rest of the protein, whereas this same region in PPR1 folds into a more compact antiparallel \u03b2\u2010ribbon. The GAL4 homodimer is highly symmetric, with the coiled\u2010coil dimerization region projecting perpendicularly from the DNA. The PPR1 homodimer, however, becomes very asymmetric beyond the N\u2010terminal DNA\u2010binding modules, leaning to one side to form a hydrophobic core.

SRF was the first of these proteins to have its three\u2010dimensional structure determined (Pellegrini et al., 1995). This protein is homodimeric and consists of three layers (Fig. 18A). The first layer is a left\u2010handed antiparallel coiled\u2010coil formed from an amphipathic helix from each monomer. The coiled\u2010coil sits above the minor groove near the DNA dyad (the binding site) in an approximate parallel orientation to the minor groove and makes contacts with the phosphate backbone. The DNA is bent by 72\u00b0 along its helical axis at this point, wrapping around the coiled\u2010coil and enabling the N\u2010terminal portions of the two helices to fit into the major groove of the DNA. In addition, N\u2010terminal arms from each helix extend across the phosphate backbone and bind in the minor groove of the DNA. The coiled\u2010coil is supported by a four\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet that lies flat across the helices opposite the DNA.

Dimer contacts are made through the C\u2010terminal portion of the first helix and a coiled\u2010coil formed by the second helix of each monomer. In some members of the HLH family, the coiled\u2010coil contacts are formed by a leucine zipper; in other HLH proteins the second helix is shorter and the coiled\u2010coil is stabilized primarily through less regular hydrophobic contacts. In both cases, the dimer is required for DNA binding. DNA bound to this motif is primarily B\u2010form with very little distortion observed. Examples of three\u2010dimensional structures of HLH proteins include the eukaryotic transcription factor Max (Ferre\u2010D'Amare et al., 1993), the MyoD transcription activator (Ma et al., 1994), the HLH region of the upstream stimulatory factor (USF; Ferre\u2010D'Amare et al., 1994), and the E47 regulatory protein (Ellenberger et al., 1994; Table 6).",

The HMG consensus box consists of \u223c80 residues with an average conservation of 25% amino acid identity between boxes. HMG box proteins fall into two subfamilies. The first is observed in all cell types, contains multiple HMG box domains, and tends to bind DNA with little specificity, while the second subfamily is found in fewer cell types, contains only one HMG box domain, and binds DNA specifically. In the mid\u20101990s, the NMR solution structures of the HMG domains in two proteins of the second subfamily complexed with DNA (Love et al., 1995; Werner et al., 1995) and the solution structures of uncomplexed HMG domains from the first subfamily revealed a three\u2010helix L\u2010shaped structure which binds DNA exclusively in the minor groove and induces profound structural changes in bound DNA (Fig. 18D). Helices 1 and 2 are antiparallel to each other (with an acute angle between them) forming the base of the L. Helix 3, the longest helix, is almost perpendicular to helix 2 and forms the vertical arm of the L. All three helices participate in forming a concave surface for binding the minor groove and phosphate backbone of the target DNA, causing severe DNA unwinding and bending away from the major groove.",

The histone core subunits and the TAF fragments form similar heterodimeric and heterotetrameric structures.

TBP consists of a C\u2010terminal region of \u223c180 residues which is highly conserved across species, and a variable length N\u2010terminal region. The crystal structure of TBP from Arabidopsis thaliana bound to the TATA\u2010box DNA consensus sequence reveals a quasi\u2010symmetric \u03b1/\u03b2 structure composed of a curved ten\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet with four \u03b1\u2010helices sitting on the convex side of the sheet with an overall shape resembling a saddle (Fig. 19B; Burley, 1996). Two distinct loops project away from the protein on each end of the \u03b2\u2010sheet forming stirrups for the saddle. DNA containing the TATA box consensus sequence binds to the concave surface formed by the eight central strands of the \u03b2\u2010sheet with an induced fit mechanism resulting in remarkably distorted DNA that is partially unwound and bent almost 90\u00b0. TBP has marked intramolecular pseudosymmetry with an approximate two\u2010fold axis passing through the center of the protein perpendicular to the \u03b2\u2010sheet.

Crystal structures of STAT\u20101 and \u20103\u03b2 homodimers bound to DNA reveal elongated, four\u2010domain monomers forming an arc\u2010shaped ternary complex with DNA (Fig. 19J; Becker et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1998c). The N\u2010terminal domain is a coiled\u2010coil bundle of four antiparallel \u03b1 helices. These helices project away from the DNA, have no interactions with DNA or the other monomer, and possess a primarily hydrophilic surface. The second domain is the DNA\u2010binding domain. Like the other members of the Ig\u2010like transcription factor superfamily, this domain is a modified C2\u2010type Ig fold. The AB loop has an extra \u03b2\u2010strand (A\u2032), the CC\u2032 loop contains an inserted \u03b1\u2010helix (\u03b15) and \u03b2\u2010strand (X), the EF loop has an extra \u03b2\u2010strand (E\u2032), and \u03b2\u2010strand G ends with an additional \u03b2\u2010strand (G\u2032). All three of the modified loops and the C\u2010terminal tail participate in DNA binding. Following the Ig domain and prior to the SH2 domain is a helical connector or linker domain consisting of a bundle of four \u03b1 helices and a small two\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet. The SH2 domain (see Modular Domains Involved in Signal Transduction) binds a phosphorylated tyrosine from the C\u2010terminal tail of the other monomer in the complex, effectively clamping the two monomers together.",

            "text": "The RNP domain, also known as the RNA recognition motif (RRM) or consensus sequence RNA\u2010binding domain (cs\u2010RBD), is one of the most widely observed and well characterized RNA\u2010binding domains (Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994). It is identified in amino acid sequences by two highly conserved consensus sequences referred to as RNP1 and \u20102, within a more weakly conserved region of \u223c80 residues. The SMART database lists over 3400 proteins containing RNP (see Web\u2010Based Structural Bioinformatics and http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/browse.shtml ). The three\u2010dimensional structure of RNP domains determined in the early 1990s (U1A splicosomal protein; Oubridge et al., 1994) and the RNA\u2010binding domain of hnRNP C (Wittekind et al., 1992) revealed a four\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet with two \u03b1\u2010helices laying across one face with a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 topology. The crystal structure of the RNA\u2010binding fragment of the U1A splicosomal protein complexed with a 21\u2010nucleotide RNA hairpin showed that the RNA binds as an open structure to the exposed \u03b2\u2010sheet surface opposite the helices (Fig. 20A; Oubridge et al., 1994). Two loops from one end of the \u03b2\u2010sheet protrude through the middle of the RNA loop, positioning and stabilizing the RNA structure on the sheet, and preventing base pairing. This enables sequence\u2010specific interactions to occur between the bases and both main\u2010 and side\u2010chain atoms on the \u03b2\u2010sheet. Although it has no sequence homology with RNP proteins, the ribosomal protein S6 has been observed to have the same fold with a topology identical to the U1A protein (Fig. 20B; Lindahl et al., 1994). Similar \u03b1/\u03b2 folding patterns have also been observed in the structures of other ribosomal proteins such as L6, L7/L12, and L30 (Lindahl et al., 1994). The bacteriophage T4 regA translational regulator protein also contains two regions that have sequence homology to the RNP1\u2010 and \u20102 sequence motifs. This protein specifically represses the translation of 35 early T4 mRNAs. The 1.9\u2010\u00c5 crystal structure of T4 regA consists of two antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets (three and four strands, respectively) and four helices (Fig. 20C; Kang et al., 1995). The larger \u03b2\u2010sheet contains the RNP1 and \u20102 sequence motifs in two adjacent \u03b2\u2010strands exposed to solvent, and superficially resembles the RNA\u2010binding \u03b2\u2010sheet in the U1A protein.",

The structures of these proteins (Schindelin et al., 1993, 1994; Schnuchel et al., 1993; Newkirk et al., 1994), however, consist of a five\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010barrel known as the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) fold (Fig. 21A and B; Murzin, 1993).

As with the RNP domain, these domains can be identified by a short consensus sequence. The three\u2010dimensional structures for two dsRBD\u2010containing proteins, E. coli RNase III (Kharrat et al., 1995) and Drosophila staufen protein (Fig. 22A; Bycroft et al., 1995), and one KH motif\u2010containing protein, human vigilin (Fig. 22C; Castiglone Morelli et al., 1995), each contain a three\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet with two or three helices packed against one face to form an \u03b1/\u03b2 structure, albeit with different topology. Furthermore, a topological variant of the canonical KH domain has been observed in the ribosomal protein S3 from T. thermophilus (Carter et al., 2001; Grishin, 2001). Despite the superficial similarities in structure, the RNP, dsRBD, and KH domain RNA\u2010binding structural motifs all appear to bind RNA by distinctly different modes. The dsRBD motif is proposed to interact with double\u2010stranded RNA through the end loops of the \u03b2\u2010sheet, the N\u2010terminal end of the last helix, and a portion of one face of the \u03b2\u2010sheet (Bycroft et al., 1995; Kharrat et al., 1995). The KH domain has been suggested to bind single\u2010stranded RNA via the helical side of the domain (Gibson et al., 1993). The N\u2010terminal domain of ribosomal protein S5 (Fig. 22B) from Bacillus stearothermophilus shares a number of conserved residues with dsRBD of staufen protein in addition to a similar topology, suggesting it may bind RNA in the same way as a dsRBD motif (Bycroft et al., 1995).",

As of early 2003, the SMART database listed over 2000 proteins with this domain (see Web\u2010Based Structural Bioinformatics and http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/browse.shtml). Examples of EF\u2010hand\u2010containing proteins include calmodulin, troponin C, essential light\u2010chain and regulatory light\u2010chain myosin, parvalbumin, intestinal and sarcoplasm calcium\u2010binding proteins, calcineurin B, recoverin, and extracellular matrix protein BM\u201040 (Table 10). There are two kinds of Ca2+\u2010binding sites among the EF\u2010hand motif proteins: high and low affinity. The high affinity Ca2+\u2010binding sites appear to primarily provide structural stability to proteins, whereas the low affinity sites often function to regulate the active protein conformations, and hence are also termed regulatory sites. For example, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change upon binding of Ca2+ ions to the regulatory sites (Meador et al., 1992). Both crystal structures and NMR structures of a number of EF\u2010hand proteins have been solved (Herzberg and James, 1988; Satyshur et al., 1988; Meador et al., 1992; Svensson et al., 1992; Flaherty et al., 1993; Rayment et al., 1993; Findlay et al., 1994; Xie et al., 1994; Hohenester et al., 1996).

In most situations, they form pairs with the two EF\u2010hands in a pair related by approximately two\u2010fold symmetry. The Ca2+ coordination is usually described as a pentagon bipyramid geometry with a total of six to seven ligands which are from the carboxylate groups of Asp, Glu, and main chain carbonyl oxygens in the loop region.

Although many of these proteins are multidomain \u03b1/\u03b2 structures, their dinucleotide\u2010binding domains typically have a common three\u2010dimensional fold. These binding domains contain a central five\u2010 or six\u2010stranded parallel sheet, strand order 3\u20102\u20101\u20104\u20105\u20106, connected to helices on each face through right\u2010handed loops (Table 11; Fig. 27A). The conserved topology for this \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich motif as compiled by G.E. Schultz (1995) and A.M. Lesk (1995) is illustrated in Figure 27B. In each case, the dinucleotide binds across the C\u2010terminal end of the sheet with the ADP portion interacting specifically with the central \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 unit of this fold (\u03b21\u2010\u03b11\u2010\u03b22). The core sequence motif (also called the fingerprint sequence) for this \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold is Gly\u2010X\u2010Gly\u2010X2\u2010Gly (where X is any amino acid) and is located in a loop between \u03b2\u2010strand 1 and helix 1. This sequence permits unusual main chain dihedral angles in the binding loop and close contacts with ADP. The pyrophosphate moiety sits at the N\u2010terminal end of the helix following the loop, a favorable environment for the negative charges (Wierenga et al., 1985). Another conserved feature is an Asp or Glu residue at the C\u2010terminal end of the second \u03b2\u2010strand of the \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 unit for binding the ribose moieties of NAD and FAD, respectively. NADP\u2010binding domains contain an Arg at this position for binding the 2\u2032\u2010phosphate (Schultz, 1992). One additional eleven\u2010residue sequence motif has been located in \u03b2\u2010strand 5 of the canonical dinucleotide binding fold in FAD\u2010binding domains which includes a C\u2010terminal aspartic acid that interacts with the ribitol moiety of FAD (Eggink et al., 1990).",

            "text": "First noted in the structure of adenylate kinase (Fig. 27C; Schulz et al., 1974), the mononucleotide\u2010binding fold is superficially very similar to the dinucleotide\u2010binding fold (above), but has a different topology. This fold also consists of an \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich with a central five\u2010stranded parallel \u03b2\u2010sheet and right\u2010handed connections to helices (Table 11, Fig. 27C and D; Schultz, 1992). The strand order is 2\u20103\u20101\u20104\u20105. As in the case of the dinucleotide\u2010binding fold, mononucleotide binds to a critical glycine\u2010rich loop at the C\u2010terminal end of the \u03b2\u2010sheet between strand 1 and helix 1. This loop (also referred to as the P\u2010loop) is much longer than the shorter dinucleotide\u2010binding loop, enabling it to form a giant positively charged anion hole for interacting with the mononucleotide triphosphate moiety (Dreusicke and Schulz, 1986). The loop's core sequence motif, Gly\u2010X2\u2010Gly\u2010X\u2010Gly\u2010Lys (where X is any amino acid) has been used to identify many more mononucleotide\u2010binding proteins including some from the more distantly related GTP\u2010binding proteins (also known as G proteins) which also have a P\u2010loop (Saraste et al., 1990; Schultz, 1992; Traut, 1994). Slight variations of the mononucleotide\u2010binding fold include the flavodoxin\u2010like and the resolvase\u2010like proteins. In these families, the first \u03b2\u2010strand is displaced to create a strand order of 2\u20101\u20103\u20104\u20105 instead of 2\u20103\u20101\u20104\u20105. Furthermore, in the resolvase\u2010like fold, the fifth \u03b2\u2010strand is antiparallel to the rest. G proteins have an extra sixth strand in the \u03b2\u2010sheet with strand order 2\u20103\u20101\u20104\u20105\u20106 and the second \u03b2\u2010strand is antiparallel to the rest. Other variations include protein structures that do not contain the canonical P\u2010loop fingerprint sequence\u2014e.g., CheY chemotactic protein; Volz and Matsumura, 1991), \u03b3\u03b4\u2010resolvase (Sanderson et al., 1990), flavodoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1972). Further perturbations of the mononucleotide\u2010binding fold are listed under the heading Fold: P\u2010loop Containing Nucleotide Triphosphate Hydrolases in the SCOP database (see Web\u2010Based Structural Bioinformatics and http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/index.html). It should also be noted that some mononucleotide\u2010binding proteins, such as adenylate kinase, also bind monophosphate nucleotides in a distinctly different binding site, albeit close in proximity to the classical site discussed in this section.",

            "text": "Despite numerous structural differences, the single\u2010chain catalytic domains of the above\u2010mentioned polymerases each possess a common arrangement of subdomains centered around a large nucleotide\u2010binding cleft which can be loosely described as a U\u2010shaped structure resembling a person's right hand. Using nomenclature introduced by Ollis et al. (1985), the central base of the structure is referred to as the palm subdomain, and the two vertical walls of the U are called the fingers and thumb subdomains (Fig. 28A). It is noteworthy that bovine and yeast poly(A) RNA polymerases do not have a thumb subdomain (Bard et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2000). The palm catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer reaction, the fingers are involved in template positioning, and the thumb may be important in DNA binding and processivity (Hubscher et al., 2002). Structures of polymerase/DNA and polymerase/DNA/dNTP complexes suggest that the thumb and finger subdomains in some cases make dramatic movements during different stages of the polymerization reaction (Fig. 28B; Beese et al., 1993; Pelletier et al., 1994; Franklin et al., 2001). Associated catalytic functions distinct from polymerase activity, such as the 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exonuclease activity in the Klenow fragment (KF) of E. coli DNA polymerase I, RNase activity in RT, 5\u2032\u2010nuclease activity of pol\u2010\u03b2 and Taq polymerase, and nascent RNA binding by T7 RNA polymerase, are located in separate N\u2010 or C\u2010terminal domains. Still more related functions reside in associated subunits. The central palm is the most structurally conserved subdomain among polymerases. It consists of a three\u2010 to six\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet with two helices packed against one face of the sheet (Fig 28C), a structure similar to the RNP motif found in many RNA\u2010binding proteins (see \nKH and ds\nRBP Domains). The exposed side of the sheet displays the conserved active site Asp residues. With regard to this subdomain, however, the eukaryotic \u03b2 polymerase and eukaryotic poly(A) RNA polymerases are unique (Davies et al., 1994; Sawaya et al., 1994; Bard et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2000). Although the palm subdomain has a similar \u03b1/\u03b2 sandwich fold, the overall topology is quite different (Fig 28D). In contrast to the palm subdomain, the fingers and thumb subdomains appear to be functionally related rather than structurally analogous between polymerase domains. For example, the thumb subdomains of KF, Taq polymerase, and T7 RNA polymerase all consist of a helical bundle with one or two long helices; however, the thumb subdomains of pol\u2010\u03b2 and RT are \u03b1/\u03b2 structures each having three \u03b1\u2010helices and one or two \u03b2\u2010strands, respectively. Finger subdomains are similarly divergent. The Y family polymerases have an additional conserved \u03b1/\u03b2 domain sometimes referred to as the little finger (Ling et al., 2001). The eukaryotic poly(A) RNA polymerases have an additional C\u2010terminal domain with an RRM\u2010like fold (see The RNP Domain) that is known to interact with the RNA primer (Bard et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2000). Not only are the folds of the subdomains variable, but the order of the subdomains within the primary sequence differs as well in various polymerases (Sawaya et al., 1994). Moreover, RT functions as a heterodimer (p66/p51) while other homologous polymerase domains function as monomers. Interestingly, the p51 subunit of RT results from the cleavage of the C\u2010terminal RNase H domain from p66. Thus, both p51 and p66 have the structurally equivalent thumb, fingers, and palm subdomains. In addition, both RT subunits also contain another \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomain termed the connection subdomain, which bridges the RNase H and polymerase domains in the larger subunit (Jacobo\u2010Molina et al., 1993). P66 and p51 differ dramatically in the spatial arrangement of their subdomains (Fig. 28E), resulting in two morphologically and functionally asymmetric subunits, with the polymerase activity residing only in the larger p66 subunit (Jacobo\u2010Molina et al., 1993; Joyce and Steitz, 1994).",

Each ring is composed of six nearly identical domains, each of which is two\u2010fold symmetric, consisting of two four\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets packed edge\u2010to\u2010edge at a \u223c45\u00b0 angle with two antiparallel helices packed against the concave side of the domain (Fig. 29A). The \u03b2\u2010sheets of adjacent domains hydrogen bond to each other forming six curved eight\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets that line the outer surface of the ring. The complete ring structure results from the 12\u2010fold repeat of the simple topological structural motif \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 round the entire circle (Fig. 29B). Despite the striking structural similarity, there is only 15% sequence identity when individual domains from each protein are aligned (Krishna et al., 1994). Sequence alignments of individual domains within the same protein give similar results. A head\u2010to\u2010tail dimer of the \u03b2\u2010subunit of pol III forms the entire six\u2010fold circle; each subunit comprises three domains. The bacteriophage RB69 and T4 rings, and the PCNA ring consist of trimers with two domains per subunit. ATP and auxiliary proteins are required for assembly around duplex DNA and dissociation does not occur easily, unless the DNA is linearized. In each case the ring has a substantial net negative charge and positively charged side chains are concentrated on the twelve \u03b1\u2010helices lining the central channel, which should allow favorable interaction with the phosphate backbone of DNA passing through the channel (Kong et al., 1992; Krishna et al., 1994). In addition, the orientation of helices facing the channel is such that they are nearly perpendicular to the phosphate backbone of B\u2010form DNA, precluding specific interaction with the grooves. These physical characteristics, as well as the size of the inner diameter (30 to 35 \u00c5), make both proteins well suited for encircling DNA in a manner that allows for unrestricted movement along a duplex DNA strand during polymerization. Finally, direct interaction has been observed between the T4 and RB69 sliding clamps and the corresponding DNA polymerases (Shamoo and Steitz, 1999). In other systems, intermediate proteins facilitate this polymerase linkage.",

The three\u2010dimensional structures of the N\u2010terminal catalytic fragments of two subtype IA enzymes from E. coli, topoisomerases I and III, reveal a common structural architecture (Lima et al., 1994; Mondragon and DiGate, 1999). The N\u2010terminal fragment is made of four distinct domains arranged around a large central channel with a diameter of 27.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 30A). Domain I is a four\u2010stranded parallel \u03b2\u2010sheet sandwiched between two pairs of \u03b1\u2010helices, a fold similar to the classical dinucleotide\u2010binding fold (see above). Domain II is an unusual looking \u03b2\u2010sandwich composed of two long\u2010curving three\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets that cross each other orthogonally at one end of each sheet. A single helix lies between the sheets at one end of the sandwich. The \u03b2\u2010strands of this domain line the inside of the top half of the central channel, bearing a striking resemblance to the TATA\u2010box binding protein (see \nDNA\u2010Binding Proteins that use \u03b2\u2010Sheet Motifs; Burley, 1996). Domains III and IV are each primarily helical except for a small \u03b2\u2010hairpin in domain IV. Domain III contains the active\u2010site tyrosine, Tyr319, and closes one side of the central channel through an extensive interface with domains I and IV (Fig. 30A). This interface effectively buries Tyr319, suggesting that large conformational changes are required during catalysis. It has been proposed that domains II and III may move together as a rigid body away from domains I and IV, using a protease\u2010sensitive region between domains II and IV as a hinge (Lima et al., 1994). Such a movement would open a gate to the central channel and expose the active site Tyr319. The size of the closed channel is large enough to accommodate double\u2010stranded B\u2010form DNA without steric hindrance. The inner surface of the channel has a strong positive potential suitable for interaction with DNA.",

Structural studies of an N\u2010terminally truncated form of human topoisomerase IB (excluding an unstructured, highly charged \u223c200 residue N\u2010terminal domain) in complex with a 22\u2010base pair DNA duplex reveal a five\u2010domain protein structure that wraps around the DNA (Redinbo et al., 1998; Stewart et al., 1998; Fig. 30B and C). Core subdomains I, II, and III are each \u03b1/\u03b2 folds, the linker domain is a two\u2010helix antiparallel coiled\u2010coil, and the C\u2010terminal domain is composed of five short helices. Subdomain II is noted to resemble the fold of the homeodomain family despite only 11% sequence identity and no evidence from the topoisomerase structure that it interacts with DNA (Redinbo et al., 1998). Additionally, subdomain III shows striking structural similarity to bacteriophage HP1 integrase (Redinbo et al., 1998). Finally, the coiled\u2010coil of the linker domain superimposes with the Rop RNA\u2010binding protein (see Four\u2010Helix Bundles RNA\u2010Binding Protein) with a root\u2010mean square (rms) distance of 0.8 \u00c5 for 60 C\u03b1 atoms (Stewart et al., 1998). The catalytic Tyr723 resides in the C\u2010terminal domain within the positively charged channel region. Like prokaryotic topoisomerase IA, the central pore is lined with positively charged side chains for interaction with DNA, and concerted movement of subdomains I and II is proposed to take place during the catalytic mechanism, allowing DNA to enter and exit the complex; however the proposed mechanisms for the two enzymes are quite different (Redinbo et al., 1998; Stewart et al., 1998; Lima et al., 1994).",

The monomer structure of the C\u2010terminal 92\u2010kDa yeast topoisomerse II fragment reveals a modular crescent\u2010shaped protein with five domains (Fig. 30D). Berger et al (1996) divided the polypeptide chain into two subfragments, A\u2032 and B\u2032, based on their relation to the A and B subunits of the homologous bacterial enzymes. The N\u2010terminal subfragment B\u2032 has two domains, a Rossman fold\u2013like five\u2010stranded mostly parallel \u03b2\u2010sheet (see The Classical Dinucleotide\u2010Binding Fold for a discussion of the Rossman fold) sandwiched between four helices and a three\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet packed against one helix. The C\u2010terminal subfragment A\u2032 has three domains. Domain I consists of a winged\u2010helix motif (see above) of three helices and a three\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet embedded between an N\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helix, two short C\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helices, and a \u03b2\u2010hairpin. The active site tyrosine residue, Tyr783 (Fig. 30E), is located in a loop of the winged\u2010helix at the bottom of a short tunnel leading to the protein surface. Domain II comprises a four\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet packed against two helices on one face and an abutting three\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet. The third domain of subfragment A\u2032 consists of a six\u2010helix bundle and a small \u03b2\u2010hairpin. Three of the helices are unusually long, causing this domain to project out from the rest of the protein. In the initial crystal structure, the two monomers come together to form a flat heart\u2010shaped dimer with a large pear\u2010shaped central cavity 60 \u00c5 high and 55 \u00c5 wide towards the base (Fig. 30E). Although the primary dimer contacts occur at the A\u2032\u2010A\u2032 interface, the B\u2032\u2010B\u2032 interface involves extensive overlap of domains such that the B\u2032 subfragment from one monomer interacts with the A\u2032 subfragment of the other. At the interface between the first two domains in subfragment A\u2032, a 20\u2010 to 25\u2010\u00c5 groove runs across the protein surface including the region containing Tyr783. B\u2010form DNA can be modeled into this groove with the recognition helix of the winged\u2010helix motif lying in the DNA major groove (see Helix\u2010Turn\u2010Helix Motifs). A second crystal form of yeast topoisomerase II (Fass et al., 1999) and the structure of E. coli GyrA (Morais Cabral et al., 1997) reveal similar shaped dimers, but significant alterations in subdomain orientations between the three structures suggest a flexible complex that undergoes conformational changes during catalysis. The crystal structures of yeast topoisomerase II lack the N\u2010terminal ATPase domain that is proposed to lie on top of the B\u2032 subfragments; however, two crystal structures of the ATPase domain of the homologous E. coli gyrase B have been determined, enabling the modeling of the entire topoisomerase II structure (Wigley et al., 1991; Brino et al., 2000). The 43\u2010kDa fragment of DNA gyrase B is an elongated molecule consisting of two \u03b1/\u03b2 domains each with a unique fold (Fig. 30F). The first domain, which contains the ATPase site, is an eight\u2010stranded mostly antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheet with five \u03b1\u2010helices packed against the convex face. It binds ADPNP at the center of one face of the \u03b2\u2010sheet with the phosphates coordinated by a glycine\u2010rich loop at the N\u2010terminus of a helix. The second domain (also referred to as the DNA capture domain) is a four\u2010stranded mixed \u03b2\u2010sheet surrounded by four helices, including one long C\u2010terminal helix that protrudes away from the protein. In the gyrase B dimer, the most extensive interaction is through the N\u2010terminal domains (Fig. 30F). A long 15\u2010residue N\u2010terminal arm from each monomer wraps around the other monomer contributing to the ATP\u2010binding site. It is interesting to note that the binding of ATP is reported to induce dimerization (Berger et al., 1996). The C\u2010terminal domain forms dimer contacts only through one end of the protruding helix from each monomer. This dimer structure creates a large 20 \u00c5\u2010wide hole between the two C\u2010terminal domains (Fig. 30F). The C\u2010terminal half of this hole is observed to be rich in Arg residues, suggesting possible interaction with DNA.",

Two of the four subdomains (subdomains 1 and 3 according to actin notation) share a conserved core, a five\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet (with only one antiparallel strand) that is assembled as a \u03b2\u2010meander surrounded by three helices. ATP binds at the interface between the \u03b2\u2010sheets of subdomains 1 and 3. These two \u03b2\u2010sheets are connected by two conserved helices and have identical topology, suggesting a gene duplication event. The other subdomains (2 and 4) are not as well conserved among these proteins, and may carry out specialized functions in different proteins sharing this fold. In actin, hsc70, and glycerol kinase, subdomains 2 and 4 are each \u03b1/\u03b2 regions positioned at the C\u2010terminal end of the sheets of the actin fold. Subdomain 4 has identical topology in the above three proteins, but a different tertiary structure in glycerol kinase (Hurley et al., 1993). Hexokinase only has subdomain 4 (subdomain 2 is absent), which is an \u03b1\u2010helical bundle.",

Nonetheless, they share the same structural topology and furthermore a conserved catalytic triad consisting of a nucleophile (Ser, Cys, or Asp) at the end of \u03b2\u2010strand 5, an absolutely conserved His after \u03b2\u2010strand 8, and an Asp or Glu residue at the end of \u03b2\u2010strand 7 (Liao and Remington, 1990; Franken et al., 1991; Sussman et al., 1991; Noble et al., 1993; Nardini and Dijkstra, 1999).

This fold is used by a multitude of different enzymes with very diverse functions and received its name from triose phosphate isomerase (TIM), the protein in which it was first discovered (Banner et al., 1975). The three\u2010dimensional structure of the TIM\u2010barrel is a rather elegant looking eight\u2010stranded parallel \u03b2\u2010barrel surrounded by a ring of helices that are essentially antiparallel to the \u03b2\u2010strands (Fig. 34A and B). Both the \u03b2\u2010strands and the \u03b1\u2010helices are inclined to the axis of the barrel. The classical topology of this structure is an array of eight tandem up\u2010down \u03b2\u2010\u03b1 motifs which are aligned side\u2010by\u2010side in a parallel manner with consecutive strand order, eventually wrapping around to form a \u03b2\u2010barrel (Fig. 34C).

The active site Cys is situated at the end of a \u03b2\u2010strand instead of the N\u2010terminus of an \u03b1\u2010helix as in the papain subfamily. The crystal structures of several other caspases (i.e., caspase\u20103, \u20107, \u20108, and \u20109) have confirmed this unique fold and quaternary structure except for differences in substrate binding sites (see Wei et al., 2000; Chai et al., 2001; Renatus et al., 2001, and references therein). Although caspases are mammalian enzymes, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of a bacterial cysteine protease, gingipain R from Porphyromonas gingivalis, has been observed to have a very similar fold and a Cys\u2010His diad at the active site (Eichinger et al., 1999). The two subdomains within the single chain catalytic domain correspond to the small and large subunits of the caspase fold.",

The structural diversity of ubiquitin\u2010ligases presumably reflects the need for specificity among diverse protein substrates. Common among E3s is their ability to bind E2 and specific protein substrates. There are two types of E3 enzymes, which differ in their ubiquitin transfer mechanisms. The HECT\u2010type (homology to E6AP binding protein C terminus) ubiquitin ligases catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin by first forming an E3\u2010ubiquitin thioester intermediate. The E6AP\u2010Ubc7 complex is an example of an HECT\u2010type E3 enzyme. In contrast, the RING\u2010family ubiquitin ligases do not form an E3\u2010ubiquitin intermediate. They all have a RING domain that interacts with the E2\u2010ubiquitin conjugate. Examples of RING\u2010type ubiquitin ligases include c\u2010Cbl (Fig. 36B; Zheng et al., 2000), members of the seven in absentia homolog (Siah) family (Fig. 36D; Polekhina et al., 2002), and the SCF (Skp1\u2010Cullin\u2010F\u2010box) family of E3 ligases (Fig. 36E; Zheng et al., 2002). The SCF members constitute the largest and most complex family of protein ligases and ubiquitinate a rather diverse range of proteins. The SCF complex consists of a protein\u2010substrate\u2010interacting subunit, Skp2, (Schulman et al., 2000), an elongated two\u2010domain cullin subunit (Cul1), a connecting unit, Skp1, that links the Skp2 F\u2010box\u2013containing protein with cullin, and a RING domain nested on cullin (Fig. 36E). Human Skp2 has an \u223c100 residue N\u2010terminal domain of unknown structure, followed by an F\u2010box, ten leucine\u2010rich repeats (LRR; see Leucine\u2010Rich Repeats for a discussion of the LRR fold), and a 30\u2010residue tail with little secondary structure (Schulman et al., 2000). The F\u2010box is an \u223c40\u2010residue domain comprising three helices, with one helix packing orthogonally against a pair of antiparallel helices. The N\u2010terminal domain of Skp1 has an \u03b1/\u03b2 fold consisting of a three\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet packed on one face against a bundle of \u03b1\u2010helices (also known as a BTB/POZ fold) and an additional two\u2010helix extension (Schulman et al., 2000). The N\u2010terminal domain of Cul1 consists of three cullin repeats, each comprising a bundle of five \u03b1\u2010helices (Fig. 36F). The C\u2010terminal domain of Cul1 is made of two winged helix motifs (see Helix\u2010Turn\u2010Helix Motifs), a four\u2010helix bundle, and an \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomain. The zinc\u2010containing Rbx1 RING domain interacts closely with the C\u2010terminal domain of Cul1 and contributes one \u03b2\u2010strand to the five\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet of the \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomain.",

Despite low sequence homologies (<20%) and very diverse substrate specificities, a common fold is maintained among all the P450 cytochromes. The molecule folds into two domains, \u03b1 and \u03b2 (Fig. 37A). The \u03b1 domain consists of a right\u2010handed four\u2010helix bundle sandwiched between two clusters of helices, a top cluster of five helices, and a bottom cluster of three helices with two \u03b2\u2010strands. The \u03b2 domain consists of a \u03b2\u2010barrel surrounded by three helices. The \u03b2\u2010barrel is formed by two \u03b2\u2010sheets, a two\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet, and a five\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet, folded against each other (Raag et al., 1993). The heme molecule is embedded between the two domains.",

            "text": "The globin family is made up of several heme\u2010containing helical proteins used specifically for oxygen storage and transport within bacteria, insects, vertebrates, and plants. Myoglobin is the smallest of these proteins, consisting of the basic globin fold with the addition of two more short helices (C and D; Fig. 38A; Phillips, 1980). This monomeric protein binds oxygen for storage in muscle using a heme group located in a cleft between helices E and F. Mammalian hemoglobin is composed of four separate globin chains (\u03b12\u03b22) in an approximately tetrahedral arrangement (Fig. 38B; Fermi et al., 1984). Each chain binds a heme group in the same location and orientation as in myoglobin. The binding of oxygen induces changes in the quaternary structure of hemoglobin such that four oxygen molecules are bound in a cooperative manner, making it well suited for oxygen transport. Other nonmammalian hemoglobins are found to have very different oligomeric states. Pig roundworm hemoglobin, for example, is an octamer of a two\u2010domain globin fold (Kloek et al., 1993), while sea cucumber hemoglobin can be present in both monomeric and dimeric states under physiological conditions. Flavohemoglobin is a rather unusual globin. Unlike the other known globin structures, flavohemoglobin is an \u03b1/\u03b2 three\u2010domain protein containing an FAD\u2010binding domain and an NAD\u2010binding domain as well as an N\u2010terminal globin domain (Ermler et al., 1995). The middle FAD\u2010binding domain is a six\u2010stranded antiparallel \u03b2\u2010barrel with Greek key topology and the C\u2010terminal NAD\u2010binding domain is a classical dinucleotide binding domain with a five\u2010stranded parallel \u03b2\u2010sheet. Both redox domains share significant structural homology with both domains of ferridoxin reductase (Karplus et al., 1991). The physiological function of flavohemoglobin remains unknown.",

Furthermore, the first four helices in subdomain a are structurally homologous to the four helices in subdomain b. It is noteworthy that serum albumin contains 35 cysteine residues resulting in 17 disulfide bridges and one free cysteine. Despite the striking symmetry within the structure of serum albumin, its five fatty acid binding sites are located asymmetrically around the molecule (Curry et al., 1998): domain I has two binding sites, domain II has one binding site (shared with domain I), and \u03b2 domain III has three binding sites (Fig. 41C).",

Crystal structures of GroEL, GroES, an asymmetric GroEL/GroES complex, and other homologous chaperonin complexes have been determined by several groups (Table 19). GroEL (L for large) forms the cylindrical core of the GroEL/GroES complex and consists of fourteen identical subunits arranged as two heptameric rings stacked back to back (Fig. 42A). Each individual protomer is comprised of three distinct domains: equatorial, intermediate, and apical (Fig. 42B and C). The equatorial domain consists primarily of six long \u03b1\u2010helices, two short helices, and three pairs of short \u03b2\u2010strands. This is also the ATPase domain of GroEL. The intermediate domain contains a three\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet and three \u03b1\u2010helices. The apical domain consists of a mixture of five \u03b1\u2010helices and a seven\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sandwich. Structurally, the equatorial domain provides most of the intersubunit contacts within each heptameric ring and all the contacts between the two back\u2010to\u2010back stacked heptameric rings. The intermediate domain appears to bridge between the equatorial and the apical domains. Most of the contacts between GroEL and GroES are mediated through the apical domain.",

The mechanism of RGS modulation is proposed to be stabilization of the transition state of catalytic G\u03b1 subunits, since RGS possesses no affinity for the G\u03b1\u2010GDP complex, modest affinity for the G\u03b1\u2010GTP state, and high affinity for the transition analog G\u03b1\u2010GDP\u2010AlF4\n\u2212 complex.

This large complex includes four protein subunits and fourteen cofactors. The transmembrane core of the complex has pseudo two\u2010fold symmetry, formed by the structurally related chains L and M; each of which contains five membrane\u2010spanning \u03b1\u2010helices. The chlorophyll, quinone, carotenoid, and nonheme iron cofactors associate with the L and M subunits. The H subunit forms an additional transmembrane \u03b1\u2010helix and also contains \u03b2 structures on the cytoplasmic face. The eleven\u2010transmembrane helices are arranged approximately parallel to each other (Fig. 47A). The cytochrome subunit, bound to four heme groups, is on the periplasmic face and does not span the membrane. More recently, additional photosynthetic complexes have been solved, including the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the two photosystems of chloroplasts, and antenna light\u2010harvesting complexes (Axelrod et al., 2002; Chirino et al., 1994; Jordan et al., 2001; Koepke et al., 1996; Prince et al., 1997; Zouni et al., 2001).",

The crystallographic studies of bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarum have provided insight into the mechanism of this light\u2010driven proton pump (Lanyi, 1999; Subramaniam, 1999). The helices pack around a covalently linked retinal chromophore, forming an internal channel lined by hydrophilic residues (Fig. 47B). Conformational changes in the transmembrane regions have been observed during the course of the photocycle (Kataoka and Kamikubo, 2000). More recently, structures of two related haloarchaeon proteins, halorhodopsin (Kolbe et al., 2000) and sensory rhodopsin II (Luecke et al., 2001; Royant et al., 2001; Gordeliy et al., 2002), have also been determined. The versatility of the seven transmembrane helix bundle is apparent. For example, bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin are ion transporters, while sensory rhodopsin participates in photosensory signaling and interacts with transducer proteins. Structural differences, particularly in the retinal binding pocket and conformation of bound retinal, reflect the distinct functional role of sensory rhodopsin (Luecke et al., 2001; Royant et al., 2001).",

The crystal structure of the mammalian retinal photoreceptor rhodopsin represents the first high\u2010resolution structure of a G protein\u2010coupled receptor (Palczewski et al., 2000). Although the overall topology of the seven\u2010helix bundle of bovine rhodopsin resembles that of microbial rhodopsins, its structure appears unique. Unlike the parallel arrangement of the helices in bacteriorhodopsin, some of the bovine rhodopsin helices are tilted or strongly bent at proline residues (Fig. 47C). Moreover, bovine rhodopsin contains more extensive secondary structures in the intra\u2010 and extracellular regions, consistent with the disparate receptor function. There is also an additional short helix that lies parallel to the membrane surface on the cytoplasmic face. This amphipathic eighth helix is of particular interest because of its location in the G protein binding region. On the extracellular face, the three loops associate with portions of the N\u2010terminus to form a compact structure centered around two twisted \u03b2 hairpins. The second extracellular loop, which contains the inner hairpin, is linked through a conserved disulfide bond to transmembrane helix 3, and forms a plug covering the chromophore binding pocket (Bourne and Meng, 2000).",

The secondary structure is all \u03b1\u2010helical, with each subunit containing seventeen membrane\u2010inserted \u03b1\u2010helices. Many of the membrane\u2010inserted helices are tilted relative to the plane of the membrane, and not all pass entirely through the bilayer. The crystal structure revealed an internal structural repeat, wherein the N\u2010terminal portion of each subunit is structurally related to the C\u2010terminal portion. This unanticipated internal symmetry results in an antiparallel arrangement of the subunit halves. A selectivity filter is formed by helix dipoles and main chain atoms that interact with bound Cl\u2212. The partial positive charge generated by the helix dipoles likely supports electrostatic stabilization of Cl\u2212 but does not result in tight binding (and thus does not restrict Cl\u2212 movement through the pore). The carboxylate of a conserved glutamic acid near the chloride\u2010binding site protrudes into the pore, suggesting a gating function to open and close the channel through electrostatic repulsion.",

A large, water\u2010filled vestibule located in the cytoplasm between the four subunits may allow vitamin B12 to exit the transporter; two cytoplasmic loops of BtuC appear to serve as the channel gate.

Each monomer has six transmembrane and two membrane\u2010inserted \u03b1\u2010helices (Fig. 47G). Severe tilting of the transmembrane helices relative to the membrane normal, as was seen in the ClC chloride channel, allows for formation of the dumbbell\u2010shaped pore in AQP1.
