The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T-cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV-3-infected macrophages, and the effects on T-cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV-3-induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV-3 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor-a and interleukin-12 was increased significantly in MHV-3-induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine-treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon-c were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin-4 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV-3-induced hepatitis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Keywords: hepatitis B virus, interleukin, oral nucleos(t)ide analogue, programmed death ligand 1, tumour necrosis factor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Abbreviations: CHB, chronic hepatitis B; FasL, Fas ligand; HBeAg, hepatitis B e antigen; HBV, hepatitis B virus; MHV-3, mouse hepatitis virus strain 3; PD-1, programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in regions of high endemicity [1] .

Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill target cells by two major pathways: one is dependent on the exocytosis of granule effector molecules, including perforin and granzymes A and B; the other is dependent on the engagement of target cell TNFR-1 family death receptors (e.g. Fas, TNFR-1, TNFR-2) by effector cell-expressed FasL, membrane-bound or secreted TNF, or TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand [35] [36] [37] . Our results demonstrate that FasL plays an important role in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity to hepatocytes in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. However, telbivudine treatment did not promote CTL cytotoxicity. Previous studies have established that TNF-a and IFN-c are key cytokines for non-cytolytic control of HBV replication [38] [39] [40] . The release of these cytokines from T cells leads to inactivation of HBV without killing the infected hepatocytes. Our results suggest that telbivudine is altering the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines which is independent of the direct antiviral effect against MHV-3. Programmed death-1 is a receptor that is expressed on a subset of activated T and B cells and PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1) is expressed on both haematopoietic and parenchymal cells [41, 42] . In chronic viral infection, CD8 T cells express high levels of PD-1, but its ligand PD-L1 is also highly upregulated [43] . In vivo blockade of the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 has been reported to enhance T-cell responses [43] . Reduction of PD-1 during the treatment of CHB was shown to correlate with reduction of HBV DNA levels [26] . Given the role of PD-1/PD-L1 is an important inhibitory pathway in T-cell function, the effect of telbivudine on the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was investigated to further define the effect of telbivudine on T-cell response. Although telbivudine does not alter the expression of PD-1, of note is that it significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression on T cells in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. This result provides initial evidence for a role of telbivudine in this inhibitory pathway in regulating T-cell function that may favour the development of immune clearance of virus infection. However, the effects of telbivudine on PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on other cell types should be clarified in further studies. Also, the underlying molecular mechanism requires further investigation. One of the proposed mechanisms is upregulation of the activity of cellular kinases to facilitate efficient phosphorylation. On the other hand, many nucleoside analogue-like substances [e.g. CpG-containing DNA, as found in DNA viruses and bacteria; viral dsRNA; the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C)] can exert immunomodulatory activities via tolllike receptors. As telbivudine is a thymidine nucleoside analogue, it may exert immunomodulatory activities via tolllike receptors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 687, "end": 691, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1091, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1096, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1101, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1437, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1442, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1447, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1902, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2026, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2145, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2254, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, the present study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of telbivudine in MHV-3-induced hepatitis may be mediated by its effect on the immune response rather than the inhibition of viral replication in this animal model.
