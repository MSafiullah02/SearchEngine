With limited age-disaggregated data becoming available, early indications are that the virus, as most other viruses in the past, has been particularly severe on older people [1]. Public health managers tend to monitor and evaluate epidemic responses by looking at the overall mortality rates and where available, specific mortality rates among children and \u2018healthy\u2019 adults. Older people in general though have been identified to have higher susceptibility to the effects of epidemics. This is likely owing to their dwindling immunity, contributed partly by the physiology of the ageing process and more specifically due to any existing co-morbid conditions [2].",

We all know that the ageing process can hamper cognitive skills with respect to the speed of processing, cognitive flexibility, capacity to draw inferences from a variety of information and the ability to focus.",

It is critical to be able to design health campaigns and messages that are tailored to their needs during epidemics. There is little evidence on how older people receive information during epidemics and whether behaviour change campaigns have been successful or not. Theories generated from behavioural and psychosocial epidemiology of old age would recommend that the messaging be limited, focused and unambiguous with the intention of not overwhelming or confusing them [4].",

In simpler words, what happened to a neighbour and what happened during previous epidemics is likely to attract more attention from older people. The medium used for communication also matters. Time-tested communication channels such as radios, television and inter-personal communication through trusted community members/health workers are more likely to get the attention of older people rather than communication through drones and the police [5]. We think all stakeholders should give due consideration to the unique needs of older people during this challenging time. In the words of the Director-General of the World Health Organization, \u2018this is time for solidarity and not stigma\u2019. We believe that this applies to older people too.",
