The high mortality rate of this disease is primarily due to the difficulty of early diagnosis, the high metastatic potential, and the poor responses to chemical therapy and radiotherapy [2]. Unfortunately, the unclear etiology of lung cancer presents a huge challenge for the treatment of lung cancer. Many groups\u2019 results showed that smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for lung cancer [3\u20135]. Otherwise, lung cancer susceptibility is also determined by host genetic factors [6, 7]. Infection may play a role in lung cancer, including human papilloma virus (PPV), Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [8\u201310]. In addition, there are some biological molecules correlated with the risk of lung cancer such as P-selectin [11] and chondrolectin (CHODL) [12]. Other known risk factors for lung cancer include exposure to several occupational and environmental carcinogens such as asbestos, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [13].",

For example, L\u00e4ubli and Borsig [14] reported that selectins were upregulated the pulmonary metastatic microenvironment is facilitated by P or L-selectin mediated interactions between tumor cells and blood components, which can significantly reduced metastasis. Other groups results also showed that high mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels were associated with poorer lung cancer survival [15], and low MBL levels increased gastric cancer risk [16]. Additionally, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin) can adhere to colorectal cells and plays an important role in colorectal carcinoma liver metastasis [17]. Recently, our laboratory has been reported that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are low expressions in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) and could be potentially useful in NHL clinical settings [18, 19]. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are novel blood-based molecular markers which can potentially be used for the diagnosis of early stage of colon cancer patients [20]. Therefore, we are interested in the expression of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer patients.",

The CRD domain of DC-SIGNR can interact with high mannose carbohydrates, and the neck domains that support the CRD may influence the ligand-binding properties of these lectins, and the intra-cellular domain located in the cytoplasmic tail containing recycling and internalization motifs [23]. DC-SIGNR is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, lymph node endothelial cells, and a significant proportion in terms of placenta capillary endothelial cells but was not expressed in peripheral blood-derived DCs [24]. Furthermore, DC-SIGNR is also expressed in the lung in both cytokeratin positive alveolar epithelia, as well as a subset of cells that co-expressed angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) but were negative for cytokeratin [25]. Like DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR can recognize and bind several pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [26]. DC-SIGNR also recognizes endogenous ligands, such as ICAM molecules [27], although their glycan epitopes have not been fully characterized. However, the role of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer was not been elucidated.",

            "text": "Brain metastasis as one of the most dreaded complications of lung cancer has a poor prognosis [30]. Up to 50 % of lung cancer patients develop brain metastasis during their course of disease [31]. The occurrence of brain metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and high morbidity in patients with advanced lung cancer, even after intensive multimodal therapy [32]. Furthermore, little is known about the pathobiology and the molecular mechanisms involved in the brain metastatic cascade which limits the possibilities for focused drug development and clinical trial [33]. S100\u03b2 and ProApolipoprotein A1 as a serum marker of brain metastasis in lung cancer have been investigated in a recent study [34\u201336]. In our study, the DC-SIGNR levels in lung cancer patients with brain metastasis are significantly higher than those without metastasis. So, we compared the correlation between serum DC-SIGNR and S100\u03b2 levels. However, there is no significant correlation between them. S100\u03b2 which is a protein found in astrocytes and only released into serum when the blood\u2013brain barrier is breached [37]. The expression of DC-SIGNR in brain tissues is still unknown. Thus, we guessed that the two molecular may have a difference mechanism to affect the brain metastasis of lung cancer and it can be investigated in further study. We also compared the serum levels of DC-SIGNR in bone, lung, and lymph nodes metastasis with non-metastasis, respectively. But we found no significant difference between them.",

Unlike T cells and B cells, NK cells can directly exert cellular cytotoxicity on tumor cells without prior sensitization and secrete immunostimulatory cytokines, which control both local tumor growth and metastasis [39]. An epidemiologic survey showed that low NK cell activity is associated with increased cancer risk [40]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the infiltration of NK cells appears to have prognostic value in gastric carcinoma [41], colorectal carcinoma [42], and lung carcinomas [43, 44], as a relatively higher level of NK cell infiltrate correlates with a better prognosis, thus suggesting relevant protective roles for NK cell infiltrate. In the present study, we detected a significantly negative correlation between serum levels of DC-SIGNR and serum percentage of NK cells in lung cancer patients. The molecular mechanism for this negative correlation is not yet known. On the contrary, we found no significant correlations between serum levels of DC-SIGNR and serum percentage of CD3, CD4, and CD8 in the present study.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis can targets DC-SIGN to inhibit the immuno-stimulatory function of DC through the interaction of the mycobacterial mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) to DC-SIGN [45]. Like DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR also can capture ManLAM and rapidly internalizes it to lysosomes, and may be involved in the clearance of mycobacteria [45]. Tailleux L et al. [46] showed DC-SIGN present in the alveolar CD11b+ M\u03a6s in the lungs of patients with TB. In present study, we found the DC-SIGNR expression in lungs of patients with TB. However, there was no significantly difference between the DC-SIGNR expression in lung cancer tissue and tuberculosis. Strikingly, both of them are lower than those in normal lung tissues.",
