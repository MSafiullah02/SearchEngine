            "text": "We wanted to test the hypothesis that the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid is associated with atopic characteristics in wheezing children. A randomized controlled trial comparing oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 3 days) with placebo in hospitalized wheezing children (n \u00bc 266, median 1.6 years, range 3 months to 15.2 years) was conducted. In this post-hoc analysis, we assessed the link between the efficacy of prednisolone and several atopic characteristics, such as atopy, aeroallergen sensitization, total IgE level, number of sensitizations, eczema, atopic eczema, blood or nasal eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, positive modified asthma predictive index/asthma, inhaled corticosteroid medication and parental asthma/ allergy. Virology was studied comprehensively. Our primary endpoint was the time until ready for discharge, and the most important secondary endpoint was the occurrence of relapses during the following 2 months. For statistics, we used interaction analyses in uni-and multivariate regression models. Overall, prednisolone did not decrease any of our predefined clinical endpoints. Neither was the efficacy of prednisolone associated with atopy. However, prednisolone significantly decreased the time until ready for discharge in children with positive modified asthma predictive index/asthma, inhaled corticosteroids, or rhinovirus infection and/or in children without azithromycin treatment. Prednisolone significantly decreased relapses in children with eczema, nasal eosinophilia and rhinovirus infection. The multiple clinical, inflammatory and viral markers associating with the efficacy of prednisolone should be confirmed in prospective trials. It is important that corticosteroid intervention trials have strict design for these potentially confounding factors.",

            "text": "Acute wheezing affects 30-50% of children before school age. 1, 2 One third of them suffer from recurrent wheezing. The main risk factors for recurrent wheezing include atopy, eczema, male gender, older siblings, maternal smoking and parental history of atopy or asthma. [1] [2] [3] Studies how viral etiology of early wheezing may contribute to later development of asthma have focused almost exclusively on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but recent studies suggest that rhinovirus may contribute as well. [3] [4] [5] It would be important to identify children at high risk for recurrent wheezing and provide them with effective treatment. 5 Only a limited number of factors predicting a favorable response to systemic corticosteroids in wheezing children have been identified. Previous studies have found that early episodes of RSV-induced wheezing do not respond to systemic corticosteroids at standard doses 6, 7 , but rhinovirus detection was not included in these studies. In two studies, non-viral factors, family history of atopy or systemic eosinophil priming were not associated with efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in young wheezing children. 6, 8 We have previously reported provocative findings on the efficacy of prednisolone in virus-positive cases of early wheezing (<3 episodes) and recurrent wheezing (!3 episodes). 9, 10 Prednisolone consistently decreased relapses in children affected by respiratory picornavirus infection.",

Age and number of wheezy episodes, however, were not associated with the response to prednisolone treatment. Only a limited number of studies have focused on nonviral factors predicting a favorable response to systemic corticosteroids in wheezing children. In two studies, family history of atopy or systemic eosinophil priming were not associated with efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in young wheezing children. 6, 8 The limitations of the former include a rather small sample size and of the latter a delay of up to 12 months between measurement of eosinophil priming and prednisolone treatment and parents' responsibility to initiate the treatment. The results of the studies of blood or mucosal eosinophil counts as predictors of response to corticosteroids have been variable but seem to favor their feasibility. 17, 18 In a study of wheezing infants, intermittent ICS therapy was not associated with any beneficial response either in patients with or without eczema. 19 Some of the causes for the ineffectiveness of the ICS treatment may have been a 3-day delay in starting treatment, low non-systemic dosage or out-patient setting. In another recent study, young children with a positive API benefited from ICS during a 2-year treatment but it did not have any diseasemodifying effect after its discontinuation. 20 Why atopic children did not respond to prednisolone in our study? First, most of our study children were young and may not have had enough time to develop significant sensitization. This may also explain why children with eczema responded to prednisolone, since non-atopic eczema predicts sensitization in wheezing children. 21 Second, the prevalence of aero-or perennial allergies were rather low (16-19%) . These have been the most important allergy risk groups for later development of asthma. 1, 2 Third, exposure to allergens may be more important than the type of allergy. Higher cut-off level for specific IgE and nasal eosinophilia discriminated better steroid responders, which may suggest that those with stronger/active allergies or heavier exposure to allergens are more likely to respond to systemic corticosteroids.",

[23] [24] [25] We speculate that an early asthma-like inflammation could explain the beneficial effect of prednisolone in the rhinovirus group. The children susceptible to rhinovirus induced moderate-tosevere wheezing may have an underlying immunologic anomaly predisposing them to more severe outcome as recently extensively reviewed. 26, 27 The predisposing factors are not precisely known, but may be related intrinsic genetic susceptibility (family history of asthma/ atopy, cytokine dysregulation, or lung development), environmental factors (properties of the infecting virus/ virus strain, passive smoking, or allergen exposure) and age (stage of development of immune system). These factors together may lead to altered antiviral immunity, increased inflammatory response and altered cell signaling pathways. Lower respiratory tract rhinovirus infection may even be the first sign of asthma, as suggested by Kotaniemi-Syrj\u00e4nen et al. 4 Their preliminary finding is supported by a recent report of Lemanske et al. 3 showing that first-year wheezing illnesses caused by rhinovirus infection are the strongest predictor of subsequent thirdyear wheezing.",

Viral infection was detected in 93% and bacterial seroconversion (to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) in 18% of virus positive children. 28 Macrolides have been shown to inhibit inflammatory cell mediator release and survival as well as to have a direct relaxant effect on airway smooth muscle. [29] [30] [31] CONCLUSIONS Our post-hoc analysis suggests that clinical, inflammatory and viral markers, such as history of eczema, positive modified API/asthma, nasal eosinophilia and rhinovirus infection, are likely to be associated with a favorable response to systemic corticosteroids in wheezing children. Surprisingly, allergic sensitization as such was rarely associated with a positive response to prednisolone treatment. These findings among others need to be confirmed in prospective trials which look for relationships of particular characteristics to response. It is important that corticosteroid intervention trials have strict design for these multiple and potentially confounding factors.",
