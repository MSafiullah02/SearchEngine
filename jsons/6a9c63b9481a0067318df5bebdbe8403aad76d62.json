Among these 48 cases, there was an interesting case in which the patient presented with a skin rash with petechiae. Because dengue is very common in our setting, petechiae rash is a common clinical finding in dengue, and the patient also had low platelet count, a clinical diagnosis of dengue was made by the first physician in charge. There was no photograph and a biopsy was not done because biopsy is not a routine practice according to dengue clinical practice guidelines in our tropical setting. The patient was initially misdiagnosed as dengue, which resulted in a delayed diagnosis. 3 In this case, the patient further presented respiratory problems and was referred to the tertiary medical center. Other common virus infections that might cause fever, rash, and respiratory problem were ruled out by laboratory investigation, and the final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR.",
