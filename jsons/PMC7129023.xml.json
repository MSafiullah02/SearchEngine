            "text": "Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old worldwide [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Respiratory viruses represent key pathogens involved in ALRI and can cause pneumonia and acute viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. While young age, prematurity and co-morbidities have been identified as predictors of poor outcomes [6], [7], [8], [9], the role of virus types and host inflammatory responses in disease severity is not well defined, as published results are inconsistent [10], [11]. Lately, a model of immune inflammatory response in which an imbalance between T helper (Th)1, Th2 and regulatory T cells could be responsible for severe cases of ALRI in infants and young children has been suggested [10], [12], [13]. In addition, Interleukin (IL)-33, a member of the interleukin-1 family expressed in epithelium surfaces, along with its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity (ST)2, may play an important role in the immune response associated with asthma, autoimmune disorders and infections [14], [15]. There is experimental and clinical evidence showing the involvement of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the inflammatory responses to viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16], [17], influenza [18], rhinovirus [19] and metapneumovirus [20], [21].",

Variables with repeated measures over time were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to compare concentrations of inflammatory markers at Day 1 and Day 5 in both groups. Relative risks were estimated through log-binomial regression models to compare incidences of mechanical ventilation according to the detection of IL-33 and sST2 in NPA on admission. Kaplan-Meyer estimates were calculated for hospital length of stay analysis. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the ability of viral loads to predict need for mechanical ventilation. For the latter, only the highest value of viral load for each individual was included. A 5% significance level was considered in all analysis.",

In this paper, IL-33 is mentioned as a potential biomarker of disease severity. However, few publications have addressed the IL-33/ST2 axis in viral respiratory diseases in children, with conflicting results. Similar to our findings, Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. [13] reported higher detectable IL-33 NPA levels in infants infected by RSV and rhinovirus on hospital admission when comparing to healthy controls, although no associations between higher IL-33 detections and ICU admissions or longer hospital lengths of stay were found. Saravia et al. [16] described higher IL-33 NPA concentrations in 19 infants with RSV acute viral bronchiolitis on hospital admission when compared to IL-33 NPA concentrations 28 days later, after hospital discharge. In contrast, Christiaansen et al. [24] found that higher NPA concentrations of IL-33 on hospital admission were associated with milder disease in 23 RSV infected infants. It is worth mentioning that none of the studies evaluated the same inflammatory markers in a different moment of hospitalization other than on admission. Concentrations of these molecules on Day 5 of hospital stay enabled us to characterize the host response in the acute phase of the disease.",

            "text": "The soluble form of ST2, which is one of the mechanisms of IL-33 down regulation, has been identified as a reliable biomarker of poor prognosis in cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions [25], [26]. Furthermore, while IL-33 plays an important role in tissue repair and restores tissue homeostasis in infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases, persistently high sST2 levels is often implicated in the emergence of tissue fibrosis. Indeed, sustained high serum concentrations of sST2 on the first three days of mechanical ventilation in adults with ARDS were associated with longer hospital length of stay, extubation failure and mortality [25]. Similarly, we have found that detection of sST2 in NPA samples on admission shows a high sensitivity and good accuracy in predicting need for mechanical ventilation in children with viral ALRI. Also, an increment of sST2 concentration over time was associated with a prolonged hospital stay in our patients. A multicenter cohort study [27] performed by Faber et al. reported high concentrations of sST2 on admission in the NPA of infants intubated for RSV bronchiolitis. Soluble ST2 concentrations were 20 times higher in the intubated group, when compared to those with milder disease. Although it is well known that the IL-33/ST2 axis takes part in eosinophilic modulation in asthma, the role of ST2 in neutrophilic inflammation of the airway, which is considered to be the main cause of ALRI severity in the pediatric population [28], is still poorly understood [29]. Schaunaman et al et al. [29] demonstrated an overexpression of ST2 in cultured normal human primary airway epithelial cells leading to neutrophilic chemoattractant IL-8 production, which was independently associated with M. pneumoniae or rhinovirus infection. Indeed, we observed an increase in IL-8 concentrations in NPA samples in both groups. IL-8 is mostly responsible for the local neutrophil afflux, which has been associated with mucus accumulation that has an important role in viral containment in upper respiratory tract, but can also lead to airway and alveolar obstruction. In fact, high concentrations of IL-8 have been often correlated to worse outcomes, such as hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation [10].",

            "text": "In our study, we did not observe any association between viral etiology, viral load or co-infections and disease severity. Viral-related risk factors for severe disease are not well established, as the pathogenesis of ALRI is the result of a complex interaction of environmental factors, viral virulence and host responses [35], [36], [37], [38]. Whereas studies in genomics have mapped transcriptome features in the host leading to inflammatory responses that are unique according to viral etiology and age of the patient [38], Cavallaro et al. [28] reported that the severity of the inflammatory response was independent of viral etiology. They also did not find an association between disease severity and co-infections, which was corroborated by a recently published meta-analysis [39]. A retrospective observational study on mechanically ventilated children with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU showed no differences on duration of respiratory support or PICU length of stay between bronchiolitis caused by only one virus and more than one virus [40]. Hospital length of stay, however, was longer in the co-detection group. On the other hand, a recent publication reported an association between ALRI in children by coronavirus alone or in co-detection with rhinovirus C and severity of the disease, defined as need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit in our hospital [41]. On regards to viral load, many studies have assessed the role of RSV viral load in predicting worse outcomes, with conflicting results [42]. It has been recently suggested that higher RSV viral loads at presentation elicits a more robust inflammatory response, resulting in faster viral clearance, which could be associated with milder disease [43].",

This study, therefore, adds information to the literature, concerning the pediatric host response to respiratory infections by a multitude of viral etiologies, not exclusively by RSV and/or rhinovirus, as extensively reported before. Furthermore, no other publications known by the authors studied both IL-33 and sST2 in this context. The limitations of our study include a high rate of corticosteroid use, leading to a smaller sample size and the lack of a control group of healthy patients.",
