            "text": "Background: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at minimum respiratory elastance during mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may improve patient care and outcome. The Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) trial is a two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the performance of PEEP selected at an objective, model-based minimal respiratory system elastance in patients with ARDS. Methods and design: The CURE RCT compares two groups of patients requiring invasive MV with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio \u2264 200; one criterion of the Berlin consensus definition of moderate (\u2264 200) or severe (\u2264 100) ARDS. All patients are ventilated using pressure controlled (bi-level) ventilation with tidal volume = 6-8 ml/kg. Patients randomised to the control group will have PEEP selected per standard practice (SPV). Patients randomised to the intervention will have PEEP selected based on a minimal elastance using a model-based computerised method. The CURE RCT is a single-centre trial in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Christchurch hospital, New Zealand, with a target sample size of 320 patients over a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is the area under the curve (AUC) ratio of arterial blood oxygenation to the fraction of inspired oxygen over time. Secondary outcomes include length of time of MV, ventilator-free days (VFD) up to 28 days, ICU and hospital length of stay, AUC of oxygen saturation (SpO 2 )/FiO 2 during MV, number of desaturation events (SpO 2 < 88%), changes in respiratory mechanics and chest x-ray index scores, rescue therapies (prone positioning, nitric oxide use, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and hospital and 90-day mortality. Discussion: The CURE RCT is the first trial comparing significant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS in whom PEEP is selected at minimum elastance using an objective model-based method able to quantify and consider both inter-patient and intra-patient variability. CURE aims to demonstrate the hypothesized benefit of patient-specific PEEP and attest to the significance of real-time monitoring and decision-support for MV in the critical care environment.",

While there is agreement on the preference for lower tidal volumes [1, 2] , there is relatively little consensus on the selection of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Traditionally, lower PEEP has been used [10, 11] , but low PEEP can lead to increases in oxygen desaturation and hypoxaemia [4, 12] and worsening of lung injury, indicated by greater use of rescue therapies and deaths after rescue therapy [9] . High PEEP can increase alveolar recruitment, but can decrease cardiac output and lead to further lung injury due to barotrauma and/or volutrauma [13] or overdistension [4, 9] .",

In patients with ARDS, PEEP reduces ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [4, 9] , increases recruitment [14] [15] [16] , and reduces inflammatory mediators in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [8] . MV strategies combining low tidal volumes with recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) and higher PEEP to prevent VILI have been hypothesized as ideal for lung protection [6, 17] . However, currently, there is still no standardized approach to the selection of this optimal PEEP, or to deciding how often PEEP should be adjusted or recalculated.",

[18] [19] [20] indicate that pigs induced with ARDS experience minimal respiratory elastance at a specific PEEP associated with higher oxygenation, maximum recruitment, and higher functional residual capacity, all without signs of lung overdistension. Equally, it has been proposed that PEEP should be set whereby the lung has minimal respiratory elastance (or maximum compliance), which could be clinically beneficial by balancing the risks of PEEP that is set too low or too high [21] [22] [23] . Aside from the work by Suter et al. [21] , Pintado et al. also showed that PEEP selection at minimal elastance is beneficial to patients [22] . Despite some consistent findings, the application of minimal elastance PEEP selection remains limited and hindered by the lack of an objective, reliable, and easy-to-use method to determine elastance at the bedside in real time.",

In particular, patientspecific respiratory system elastance and corresponding minimal elastance PEEP is determined using a validated model-based method and computer software [25] . This trial uses real-time-identified patient-specific respiratory system elastance, and thus the trial is named the Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) RCT.

ACC cover is not automatic and their case will need to be assessed by the ACC according to the provisions of the 2001 Injury Prevention Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. If the claim is accepted by the ACC, the patient still might not receive compensation. This depends on a number of factors such as whether they are earners or non-earners. The ACC usually provides only partial reimbursement of costs and expenses and there may be no lump sum compensation payable. There is no cover for mental injury unless it is a result of physical injury. If your relative or friend has ACC cover, generally this will affect their right to sue the investigators.",

These studies ranged from healthy patients under general anaesthesia to those with ARDS. However, only a few studies have investigated the clinical potential of PEEP set at minimum elastance. Recent studies by Pintado et al. [22] and Chiew et al. [23] have shown the potential and feasibility of ventilating patients using minimum elastance PEEP. However, setting PEEP based on elastance is problematic due to the increased need of muscle relaxants, protocol burden and potential contradictory findings [22, 23] . The pilot trial was also underpowered and thus, a larger clinical trial such as the CURE RCT is required to provide further insight and validate the potential benefit of optimising mechanical ventilation PEEP with model-based methods.",

Thus, the standard practice ventilation in the participating hospital relies on general approaches [2] and is highly variable between clinicians. There may be no equal comparator for a mechanical ventilation study resulting from this variability. Patients recruited to the CURE RCT will have the MV mode set to bi-level ventilation in both the intervention and the control group; it is debatable that bi-level ventilation may lack certain ventilation advantages.

However, this number is also too small compared to reports [43, 44] . The small number may be due to changes in the ARDS definition [27, 45] and misdiagnosis [46] . Estenssoro et al. [46] report that misdiagnosis could occur due to delayed screening. Thus, in the CURE RCT, any patient requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is screened immediately, as per Villar et al. [27] , whereby the P/F ratio is measured at PEEP = 5 cmH 2 O, and FiO 2 = 50%. Equally, retrospective screening was also performed and identified > 200 patients eligible for the trial per year. Hence, a 3-year study is planned to achieve the target sample size at an estimated recruitment rate of 50%.",
