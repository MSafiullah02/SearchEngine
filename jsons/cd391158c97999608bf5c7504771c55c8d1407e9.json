However even such settings are not prepared to deal with the situation, and lessons are only slowly being learnt. There is still an urgent need to accelerate protocols that lead to the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing and effective antiviral therapies. In some high-risk populations, such as dialysis patients, where several individuals are treated at the same time in a limited space and overcrowded areas, our objective must be to ensure protection to patients, the healthcare team and the dialysis ward. The difficult Italian experience may help other countries to face the challenges. The experience of the Lombardy underlines the need for gathering and sharing our data to increase our knowledge and support common, initially experience-based, and as soon as possible evidence-based position to face this overwhelming crisis.",

Prompt diagnosis is a protection for the whole dialysis ward. Systematic use of surgical masks helps reduce transmission and limit stress Action 2 Protect the team Nursing and medical staff are at high risk for nosocomial infections; protecting the team also protects a unit's overall activity, especially in settings in which shortages of physicians and nurses are already critical [12] . Nursing shortages should be prevented by all means, including recruitment of retired nurses, or rapid training of young ones Action 3 Protect the dialysis ward The dialysis ward is a setting at high risk for infectious outbreaks; the dialysis procedure is time consuming, and the extracorporeal circuit is a risk element; the management of the arteriovenous fistula is likewise critical. The decision to keep positive patients out of the dialysis ward as much as possible, especially at a time when patients are stressed, nurses are working under pressure, and members of the healthcare team may be ill or in quarantine, protects the dialysis ward and makes it possible to protect patients and staff (A) Dispensers of alcoholic solutions should be installed in waiting rooms and all patients should be told to use them. (B) Hemodialysis patients should be told to wash their hands and fistula arm before starting dialysis and should thoroughly disinfect the puncture areas. (C) Whenever possible, a short evaluation should be made before a patient is allowed to enter the dialysis ward and body temperature should be systematically measured. (D) Nursing and medical staff working in dialysis rooms should wear surgical masks and protective glasses, wash their hands with soap and water and systematically use alcoholic solutions and disposable gloves. Surgical masks should be changed every 4-6 h, according to type and producer's instructions. (E) Nursing and medical staff should be tested at least upon the appearance of symptoms, whose definition should be as broad as possible. Testing contacts may be useful, but depends upon availability of the tests. (F) Patients with a cough, fever (of whatever entity, taking into account the fact that the febrile reaction may be blunted in dialysis patients), upper airway involvement or conjunctivitis should be evaluated before they are allowed to entry into the dialysis ward. (G) It is advisable that each center organizes an isolated area (unless the hospital has provided an alternative path) for allowing evaluation and testing of these patients. (H) All patients with suspected signs or symptoms should be tested, keeping in mind the possible subtle manifestation of the disease. (I) Whenever possible, all patients should wear a surgical mask.
