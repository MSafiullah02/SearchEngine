However, this does not come without its own drawbacks and challenges. User implicit feedback cannot be directly treated as (pure) relevance labels because it presents a number of biases, and part of this implicit user signal may actually be noise. For example, in web search, users often examine the search engine result page (SERP) from top to bottom. Thus, higher ranked documents have a higher probability to be examined, attracting more clicks (position bias), which in turn may infer these results as relevant even when they are not [7, 18, 24]. Other types of biases may affect this implicit feedback including selection and presentation bias [2, 16, 40]. In addition, clicks on SERP items may be due to noise, e.g., sometimes users may click for unexpected reasons (e.g., clickbaits and serendipity), and these noisy clicks may hurt the learnt ranker. Hence, in order to leverage the benefits of implicit feedback, LTR algorithms have to be robust to these biases and noises. There are two main categories of approaches to learning a ranker from implicit feedback [14]:",

COLTR uses the DBGD framework from OLTR to interactively update the ranker used in production, but it uses the counterfactual evaluation mechanism of CLTR in place of online evaluation. The main challenge we address is that counterfactual evaluation cannot be directly used in online learning settings because the propensity model is unknown. This is resolved by mirroring solutions developed for learning in the bandit feedback problem (and specifically the Self-Normalized Estimator [34]) within the considered ranking task \u2013 this provides a position-unbiased evaluation of rankers. Our empirical results show that COTLR significantly improves the traditional DBGD baseline algorithm. In addition, because COTLR does not require interleaving or multileaving, which is the most computationally expensive part in online evaluation [28], COLTR is more efficient than DBGD. We also find that COLTR performance is at par with the current state-of-the-art OLTR method [22] under noisy click settings, while presenting a number of avenues for further improvement.",

An advantage of this approach is that candidate rankers are trained and evaluated offline, i.e., before being deployed in production, thus avoiding exposing users to rankers of lesser quality compared to that currently in production. However, unlike traditional supervised LTR methods [20], users interaction data provides only partial feedback which cannot be directly treated as absolute relevance labels [14, 16]. This is because clicks may have not been observed on some results because of position or selection bias, and clicks may have instead been observed because of noise or errors. As a result, much of the prior work has focused on removing these biases and noise.",

Joachims et al. [18] developed an unbiased (with respect to position) LTR that relies on clicks using a modified SVMRank approach that optimizes the empirical risk computed using the Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) estimator. The IPS is an unbiased estimator which can indicate the effectiveness of a ranker given propensity (the probability that the user will examine a document) and click data [18]. However, this approach requires a propensity model to compute the IPS score. To estimate this, randomization experiments are usually required when collecting the interaction data and the propensity model is estimated under offline setting [37, 38].",

Selection bias refers to the fact that users can only interact with items presented to them. Typically, in ad placement systems, the assumption is made that users examine the displayed ads with certainty if only one item is shown: thus no position bias. However, users are given the chance to click on the displayed item only, so clicks are heavily biased due to selection. User interactions with this kind of systems are referred to as bandit feedback [17, 33, 34]. The Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) learning principle [33] is used to remove the bias from bandit feedback. Instead of a deterministic ranker, this group of methods assume the system relies on the hypothesis that a probability distribution is available over the candidate items, which is used to sample items to show to users. Importance sampling [3] is commonly used to remove selection bias.",

Subsequent methods developed more reliable or more efficient online evaluation methods, including Probabilistic Interleaving (PIGD) which has been proven to be unbiased [12]. The Probabilistic Multileaving extension (PMGD) [28], compares multiple rankers at each interaction, resulting in the best DBGD-based algorithm, which reaches a better convergence given less training impressions [23]. However, this method suffers from a high computational cost because it requires sampling ranking assignments to infer outcomes. Further variations that reuse historical interaction data to accelerate the learning in DBDG have also been investigated [10].",

            "text": "The proposed COLTR method uses counterfactual evaluation to estimate the effectiveness of candidate rankers based on the click data collected by the logging ranker. This is unlike DBGD and other OLTR methods that use interleaving. In the counterfactual learning to rank setting, the IPS estimator is used to eliminate position bias [18], providing an unbiased estimation. However, the IPS estimator requires that the propensities of result documents are known. The propensity of a document is the probability that the user will examine the document. In offline LTR settings, propensities are estimated using offline click-through data, via a randomization experiment [38]. Offline click-through data is not available in the online setting we consider, and thus the use of IPS in such an online setting becomes a challenge. To overcome this, we adapt the counterfactual estimator used in batch learning from logged bandit feedback [32, 34]. This type of counterfactual learning treats rankers as policies and samples documents from a probability distribution to create the result list. This allows us to use importance sampling to fix the distribution mismatch between policies and to use Monte Carlo approximation to estimate the risk function \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathcal {R}(f_{\\theta ^{'}})$$\\end{document}:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} \\mathcal {R}(f_{\\theta ^{'}}) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum _{i=1}^k \\delta _{i} \\frac{p(d_{i}|f_{\\theta ^{'}},D)}{p(d_{i}|f_{\\theta },D)} \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}Where k is the number of documents in the result list, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\theta $$\\end{document} is the feature weights of the logging ranker, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\theta ^{'}$$\\end{document} is the new ranker\u2019s feature weights which need to be estimated, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\delta $$\\end{document} is the reward function.

In fact, it does not need to generate an interleaved or multileaved result list for exploring user preferences. When the length of the result list is large, the computational cost for multileaving becomes considerable. In addition, using online evaluation to infer outcomes is very expensive, especially for probabilistic multileaving evaluation [28]: this type of evaluation requires sampling a large number of ranking assignments to decide which ones are the winner rankers \u2013 a computationally expensive operation. In contrast, the time complexity for counterfactual evaluation increases linearly with the number of candidate rankers (the for loop in Algorithm 2, line 33). To compute the probabilities of sampling documents for the logging and new rankers (Algorithm 2, line 6 and 7), the document scores in Eq. 3 need to be renormalized after each rank: this attracts additional computational cost. For efficiency reasons, we approximate these probabilities by assuming independence, so that we can compute the probabilities only once4. As a result, COLTR can efficiently compare a large number of candidate rankers at each interaction.",

The navigational model simulates the user looking for a single highly relevant document and thus is unlikely to continue after finding the first relevant one. The informational model represents the user that searches for topical information and that exhibits a much nosier click behaviour. We use the settings used by previous work for instantiating these click behaviours, e.g., see Table 1 in [23]. In our experiments, the issuing of queries is simulated by uniformly sampling from the training dataset (line 3 in Algorithm 1). Then a result list is generated in answer to the query and the list is then displayed to the user. Finally, user\u2019s clicks on displayed results are simulated using CCM.",

From the figure, it is clear that PIGD achieves a better offline performance than COLTR. However, when more candidate rankers are considered, e.g., n is increased to 49, the offline performance of COLTR becomes significantly higher than that of PIGD. Furthermore, COLTR is also better than PMGD when the same number of candidate rankers are considered. Moreover, COLTR allows to efficiently compare a large number of candidate rankers at each interaction (impression), and thus can test with a larger set of candidate rankers. We find that increasing the number of candidate rankers can help boosting the offline performance of COLTR and achieve a higher final converge.

Table 2 reports the online performance of all methods, for all datasets and click models. The state-of-the-art PDGD has the best online performance across all conditions. COLTR outperforms PIGD and PMGD when considering the perfect click model. For other click models, COLTR is better than PIGD but it does provide less cumulative online performance than PMGD, even if it achieves a better offline performance. We posit that this is because PMGD uses a deterministic ranking function to create the result list the user observes, and via multileaving it guarantees that the interleaved result list is not worse than that of the worst candidate ranker. COLTR instead uses a probabilistic ranking function, and if the document sampling distribution is too similar to a uniform distribution, the result list may incorrectly contain many non-relevant documents: this results in a bad online performance. A uniform sampling distribution is obtained because noisy clicks result in some candidate rankers randomly winning the counterfactual evaluation and thus slowing down the gradient convergence and achieving an \u201celastic effect\u201d, where the weight vectors go forward in one interaction, and backwards in the next. This will cause the margins between the documents\u2019 scores assigned by the ranking function to become too small and thus the softmax function will not generate a \u201cdeterministic\" distribution. This also explains why the online performance is much better when clicks are perfect: the gradient directions corresponding to the winning candidates are likely similar, leading the current ranker moving fast through large gradient updates (no elastic effect).\n",

Our method, counterfactual online learning to rank (COLTR), replaces online evaluation, which is the most computational expensive step in the traditional DBGD-style OLTR methods, with counterfactual evaluation. COLTR does not derive a gradient function and use it to optimise an objective, but still samples different rankers, akin to the online evaluation practice. As a result, COLTR can evaluate a large number of candidate rankers at a much lower computational expense.",

This analysis could provide further indications about the reasons why the online performance of COLTR is limited. Other improvements could be implemented for COLTR. First, instead of stochastically learning at each interaction, historical user interaction data could be used to perform batch learning, which may provide even more reliable gradients under noisy clicks. Note that this extension is possible, and methodologically simple for COLTR, but not for PDGD. Second, the use of the exploration variance reduction method [35, 36] could be investigated to reduce the gradient exploration space: this may solve the uniform sampling distribution problem.",
