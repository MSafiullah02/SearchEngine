As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We Arch Med Res E20_405 2 believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.",

This new outbreak caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the past, termed as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) later expanded from Wuhan to other regions in China and from there to almost all the countries in the world within a period of 3 months and accumulating more than two million cases and over 130,000 deaths by the time of writing this paper according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus map (2) (3) (4) . Since the predictable impact of any pandemic depends on the total number of infected cases and until now, we are unaware of correct estimate due to the Arch Med Res E20_405 3 lack of diagnostic tests, we are unable to assess the potential severity that would be faced by the different clinical settings around the world. Noted, high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 and the less-recognized aspects of viral pathogenesis alongside its complex spectrum of clinical outcomes in infected cases are additional hampering elements complicating the puzzle of controlling the pandemic. On the March 11 th 2020, after daily escalating rates of COVID-19 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed the outbreak as a pandemic to call for further coordinated attempts to decrease the medical and economic consequences of this pandemic as soon as possible (5) . Over an eleven day period from March 19-30, 2020, the death toll due to Coronavirus increased 3.3 folds. In addition, the number of cases increased 2.9 folds in the same period of time (WHO situation reports 60 and 70) (4, 6) . The current pandemic is provoking many shortages in clinical settings, independently of the impact on the economic power of the countries affected, for example Italy and",

However, this shortage is even worse among specialized medical equipment and devices, including intensive care unit (ICU) space, hospital beds, ventilators and extracorporeal machine oxygenation (ECMO) (8, 9) . On March 30 rd 2020, WHO called for interrupt transmission chain among human to human and reduce transmission from the animal transporters (4). Talking together, authorities have recognized that they are unable to control the pandemic without shutting down normalized public life, following the strict behavior measurements established at global level by countries and people such as social distancing, in-house quarantine (self-isolation) and interruptive actions against the transmission chain. As such measurements are established, the expectation is to reduce the transmission rate and learn more to efficiently handle the ongoing pandemic and the next epidemic caused by this novel virus at national levels. In the next paragraph, we discuss the forthcoming challenges to prevent, control and eliminate No prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine has been validated yet. There are some laboratories working in at least seven possible vaccines, such as a new vaccine approach as Moderna has indicated (12) . In addition, different research groups are working in utilizing the measles vaccine as the vehicle to deliver coronavirus antigens that may induce protection (13) . Presumably, successful development of a vaccine or even antiviral drug may take several months and we do not have this amount of time to control the current pandemic. Our lack of knowledge to address the viral pathogenesis and genomic recombination has made us unable to talk fearlessly about recommendations of these approaches in the case of production of any preventive vaccine or effective drug). Therefore, a new generation of researchers should be specifically devoted to elucidate the molecular aspects of viral pathogenesis and the continuous whole genome sequencing of the isolates. There is an urgency in novel scientific information to help us to design a better roadmap to conquer this pandemic.",

There are reliable approaches including RT-PCR and serological tests to facilitate and speed the diagnosis of the illness, but the problem is the limited access to these diagnostic assays in regions with a low socioeconomic level, mostly developing countries. We should not forget that successful diagnosing of COVID-19 is bound to case-tracing as the main policy in surveillance of the illness, especially in those countries in where there are low number of cases. We must determine exactly the number of people that are infected either with mild, sub-clinical or even influenza-like manifestations which may be under reported. These asymptomatic or non-classic cases also transmit the virus to new subjects and early testing could help to identify those cases and limit their exposure to new susceptible individuals. The availability of those rapid diagnosed kits will dramatically help all countries to quickly start to respond against any outbreak caused by the virus now as well in the future. The possibility of having these kits should not be called \"idealistic\", but necessary. c) A surge of new patients is a looming event since na\u00efve subjects who are exposed to asymptomatic cases will be at risk to acquire the infection and if clinical manifestations develop, they will end up being admitted to hospitals. This calls for more hospital facilities and equipment to host those patients. This is a major challenge for health systems all over the world. Even now, many countries are suffering shortages in ICU beds, ECMO machines and also free clear space for admitted patients.",
