By July 5, the number of patients definitely diagnosed with the disease had reached 186, and 33 (17.8%) of them had died (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). MERS-CoV was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and approximately 95% of cases have been detected in the Middle East region. The infection route has not been explained clearly, although its transmission through Arabian camels was reported in Saudi Arabia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Most patients originally present with a severe acute lower respiratory infection, but some are asymptomatic or show a mild acute upper respiratory infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015).",

It has now become common for people to wear masks on the street to prevent infection. Schools were gradually closed, various cultural events were canceled, and the number of tourists decreased. The spread of MERS-CoV had extensively impacted the Korean society, not only in the socio-economic aspect but also in individuals' daily lives (Jun, 2015, Lee and Yeo, 2015).",

In addition, when nursing graduates become clinical nurses, they are educated on standard isolation precautions for each transmission route through facility programs for new nurses and continuing education programs on infection control. However, it is difficult for hospitals to maintain the resources needed to carry out, since the high cost of protective equipment for each transmission route is not covered by Korea's national health insurance (Jeong et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2001).",

Above all, nurses are mostly affected, a situation attributed to their prolonged, repeated, and close physical contact with patients (Maltezou and Tsiodras, 2014). Because nursing students complete their clinical practice coursework in hospital settings, they may also be exposed to patients and health care workers who are suspected of or diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, preventive behavior against MERS-CoV needs to be promoted among nursing students to limit the reach of the novel infectious disease in hospital environments. In this sense, it is necessary first to identify factors influencing nursing students' MERS-CoV preventive behavior.",

In this study, however, nursing students' mean MERS-CoV preventive behavior score was less than half at 4.51 out of 10. Considering that patients continued to be diagnosed with MERS even during the period of data collection, this score is not satisfactory. This result suggests that nursing students need special education on emerging infectious diseases and have preventive behaviors actively reinforced during a disease outbreak. The authors' university stopped nursing students' hospital practice, provided hand sanitizer in each lecture room, and required that students' temperatures be checked regularly as part of its preventive measures against infection during the outbreak. However, there was no education specifically on MERS-CoV and preventive behaviors against this contagious disease.

MERS is a new infectious disease but already well-known and has inflicted severe socio-economic damages upon Korea. Because of the disease outbreak, schools were closed, various cultural events were canceled, and the annual gross domestic product decreased by at least 0.1% (Jun, 2015). This study's findings provide new insights for infection prevention education in the wake of this new infectious disease.",

Furthermore, this study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey, making it hard to explain causal relationships. Lastly, because there was not a standardized scale designed to measure attitude toward infection control, the authors developed and used a new tool to evaluate this factor in relation to MERS-CoV, and psychometric properties were not extracted separately for the scale in factor analysis. Thus, attitude toward MERS-CoV measured in this study might not reflect psychometric properties adequately.",
