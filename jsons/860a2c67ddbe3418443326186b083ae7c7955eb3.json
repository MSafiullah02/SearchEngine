Also, the USA Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services released a guidance on March 17, 2020 allowing patients to be seen via videoconferencing in their homes, without having to travel to a qualifying \"originating site\" for Medicare telehealth encounters. Furthermore, the USA Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved an exception that allows prescriptions for controlled substances via telemedicine Wright without a prior in-person evaluation.

Among such apps highlighted in a recent review [6] , Virtual Hope Box, Breathe-to-Relax, Calm, and Headspace stand out as tools that could help patients manage anxiety and stress related to the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, Virtual Hope Box, a USA Department of Defense app, has features including breathing exercises, deep muscle relaxation, guided meditation, and a way to download and display photos that generate hopefulness. Chatbots, such as Woebot, and other artificial intelligence (AI)-informed developments may one day also play a role in scaling up care options when supply challenges arise.
