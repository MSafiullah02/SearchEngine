As of 17 June 2010, more than 214 countries had reported confirmed cases of infection with pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, including at least 18,156 deaths [3]. Unlike seasonal influenza, in which hospitalizations occur among patients younger than 2 and older than 65 years, or in those with underlying diseases [4], this novel virus affected otherwise healthy young and middle-aged adults and obese individuals [2,5]. Patients with previous respiratory disease, immunocompromised hosts and pregnant women were affected as frequently as with seasonal influenza [6-15]. Although a mild form of the disease was prevalent, it soon became evident that the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus could also provoke severe, acute respiratory failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation [16], which was reflected in the severe pathological injury found at autopsy [17].",

Indeed, barriers to implementing low-tidal volume have been identified and might explain physician behavior [28]. Despite this, plateau pressures did remain below 30 cmH2O [29], indicating that lung compliance might have been preserved. Perhaps clinicians focused on plateau pressures rather than on tidal volumes [30] since it still remains unclear which should be limited to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury [31]. We, like others [6,7,32,33], could not find differences in utilized tidal volumes between survivors and non-survivors. Even so, non-survivors tended to display lower values, probably reflecting physician efforts to intensify protective ventilation strategies in the most severely compromised. Some researchers [34,35] have suggested that allowing higher tidal volumes in a population of young and previously healthy patients with strong ventilatory drive might reveal an attempt to restrain heavy sedation and neuromuscular blocker use. Notwithstanding this, we believe that these findings may also represent clinicians' inadequate prescription, as described in other scenarios [36].",

Both leukocytosis and leucopenia have been found in hospitalized patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) [2,43]; in our study, persistent leukocytosis was associated with increased mortality. LDH elevations have been previously described in fatal cases [2], which corresponded to our finding of higher LDH levels in non-survivors at all time points. Such elevations have also been reported in seasonal influenza [44]. In experimental studies, increased LDH is a marker of human fetal membrane cell apoptosis induced by influenza virus [45].
