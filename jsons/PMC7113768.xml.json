            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridea family comprising ca. 70 viruses sharing common structural features, and takes its name from the Zika Forest in Uganda where it was first isolated (Dick, 1953, Dick et al., 1952). It is the causative agent of an emerging infection arising from bites of the Aedes aegypti species for which, as yet, the full implications for human health remain unclear. Widespread infection and serious birth defects, including neurological diseases and microcephaly in Brazil have been reported (Rasmussen et al., 2016). In adults, ZIKV infection has been linked epidemiologically to increased prevalence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016, Parra et al., 2016). Thus, both in utero and adult, ZIKV-associated pathological conditions suggest that the virus could infect nerves (Bell et al., 1971) and neural cells (Garcez et al., 2016). Additional modes of transmission to mosquito bites have also emerged, including sexual transmission (D'Ortenzio et al., 2016, Foy et al., 2011, Musso et al., 2015) and blood transfusion (Motta et al., 2016). These could further expand the epidemic impact of ZIKV infection, increasing the need for an effective vaccine and antiviral agents with which to treat infected individuals.",

            "text": "Conventional antiviral drug-discovery pipelines involve complex, expensive, and time-consuming processes, militating against their rapid and widespread deployment, particularly in developing countries. One attractive alternative for combating emerging and rapidly spreading infectious diseases is drug repurposing (Cheng et al., 2016), the application of an existing licensed pharmaceutical agent for another medical need. This has already been proposed for the treatment of both hepatitis C (He et al., 2015) and Ebola virus (Sakurai et al., 2015) infections. Heparin, the widely used anticoagulant, has potentially attractive features including activity against attachment and entry of the enveloped viruses, human simplex (HSV) (Herold et al., 1996, Nahmias and Kibrick, 1964), human immunodeficiency (HIV) (Baba et al., 1988), SARS coronavirus (Vicenzi et al., 2004), and influenza (H5N1) (Skidmore et al., 2015). Here, we explore the effects of heparin on ZIKV infection in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) with particular regard to virus replication and induction of cytopathic effects (CPE) resulting in cell death.",

Heparin did not exert toxic effects on uninfected cells (Fig. 2\n). Unexpectedly and strikingly, however, heparin prevented fully the virus-induced cytopathic effects of cultures infected with either the MR766 or INMI-1 ZIKV strains (Fig. 2A and B, respectively). Thus, heparin partially uncoupled the virus replication (that was only modestly inhibited) from the virus-induced death of hNPCs.",

            "text": "ZIKV infection of cranial neural crest cells has been linked to the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) exerting proapoptotic effects on adjacent cells (Bayless et al., 2016). Thus, we determined the proportion of cells that were positive for caspase-3 staining, as an indicator of apoptotic cell death (Lavrik, 2005). The proportion of caspase-3+ cells in uninfected and untreated cell cultures increased from 9.5\u00b1 3.4% at day 3 after infection (day 6 after the initial seeding) to 29\u00b1 1.1% at 7 days after infection. At the same time points, heparin decreased the proportion of caspase-3+ cells to 5.9\u00b1 2.7% and 12.1\u00b1 3.7%, respectively. In infected cultures, the proportion of caspase-3+ cells increased to 31.1\u00b1 5.5% at 7 days post-infection with the INMI-1 strain, and decreased to 16.2\u00b1 0.3% when treated with heparin (data not shown). These results suggest that the activation of the master executor of apoptosis, i.e. caspase-3, is activated in hNPC cultures independently of virus infection and that heparin probably prevents its activation by stabilizing FGF2 for the duration of the culture, as reported (Caldwell et al., 2004). In contrast, heparin fully prevented the virus-induced necrotic death of cells, as measured by the release of adenylate kinase in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2), although the mechanism of action remains unknown. Since the culture condition induced the apoptosis of uninfected hNPCs, we tested whether heparin affected ZIKV cytopathic effects, and in particular, prevented caspase-3 activation in Vero cells that are highly permissive to ZIKV replication. The background level of apoptosis in the absence of viral infection was negligible (Supplementary Fig. 1). Indeed, heparin treatment did not alter the levels of viral replication compared to control Vero cells, however, it significantly decreased the percentage of caspase-3+ cells, suggesting that heparin can also prevent ZIKV-induced apoptosis.",

            "text": "Independently of the obvious heparin anticoagulant effect, there is now considerable evidence that heparin possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and proliferative activities that rely on a variety of mechanisms (Katsi et al., 2016). However, the polyanionic nature of heparin favours the neutralization of cationic mediators of inflammation and apoptosis but, also viral envelopes (Rusnati et al., 2009). The mechanism through which heparin derivatives inhibit infectivity in other viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (Shukla and Spear, 2001), is most likely by competing with host cell surface glycoproteins or proteoglycans, or in other cases, through binding of low specificity to several proteins by virtue of their polyanionic nature (Skidmore et al., 2015). In the present case, however, the effect of heparin on infectivity is less striking than its ability to protect infected cells from cell death. The most likely mechanism to explain this phenomenon is that heparin is binding several proteins that promote inflammation and cell death. Heparin has been documented to bind and, in many cases neutralise, a range of relevant growth factors and enzymes, including tissue necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Salas et al., 2000, Spratte et al., 2013, Veraldi et al., 2015).",
