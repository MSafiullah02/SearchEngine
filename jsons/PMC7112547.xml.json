Preventing and controlling infectious disease are still associated with multiple challenges and obstacles. The increasing population and complexity of infectious disease are leading to synergistic effects. Novel pharmacological agents need to be developed for rapid diagnosis and cutting off emerging infectious diseases at the source. Exploration of novel molecular recognition elements specific for pathogens is the key strategy for development of anti-infective agents. New findings from the complete human genome sequence as well as genomes of some pathogens and on-going transcriptome and proteome projects offer novel targets for the fight against infectious diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the discovery of anti-infective agents by biochemical methodologies and to develop novel biologically active compounds.",

These oligonucleotides will fold into different secondary and tertiary structures, and they are then mixed with targets to form aptamer-target complexes. The target-bound aptamers are separated from unbound oligonucleotides by membrane filtration, magnetic beads, affinity columns, or capillary electrophoresis. The bound aptamers are amplified by PCR (DNA aptamers) or RT-PCR (RNA aptamers), and this enriched pool of aptamers is subjected to the next round of selection. Finally, the enriched aptamer sequences are identified by cloning and sequencing of individual clones, or alternatively, in recent years, high-throughput sequencing methods and bioinformatics analysis. During the SELEX process, several counterselections (negative-target selections) are added to eliminate nonspecific oligonucleotides. After 8-20 rounds of selection, specific aptamers that can bind to the target with high affinity will be obtained.",

We selected ssDNA aptamer T9, which binds to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) from the predominant clinical epidemic M.tb strains of the Beijing genotype.7 ManLAM is the major surface lipoglycan of M. tb and has immunomodulatory activity. Aptamer T9 detects ManLAM antigens in serum and sputum samples from patients with active pulmonary TB (aPTB) and patients with extrapulmonary TB (EPTB).7 The 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT6) and 10 kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10) are secreted early by virulent M. tb and are not present in nonvirulent BCG. Both our group and Rotherham et al. have reported ssDNA aptamers against ESAT6 and CFP10 (CE protein).8\n,\n9 These aptamers can detect ESAT6 and CFP10 antigens in serum samples from patients with aPTB or EPTB8 or in sputum samples.9 MPT64, which is a 24 kDa protein secreted by M. tb during bacterial growth, is also used as a diagnostic target for aptamers. Qin et al. selected ssDNA aptamers against MPT64 protein from M. tb.10 They developed ssDNA aptamer MPT64-A1 against MPT64 antibodies, and reported that aptamer MPT64-A1 has the potential for the serological diagnosis of pulmonary TB, both in sputum smear-positive and -negative patients.11 Then several ssDNA aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors were devised for the detection of MPT64 and show the limit of detection in the fg mL\u22121range.12\n,\n13 Ngubane et al. demonstrated the suitability of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based SELEX for identification of two RNA aptamers, G43 and G78, which bind to the M. tb EsxG protein with high affinities.14 The EsxG protein is both encoded within the ESX-3 locus of M. tb and secreted by the ESX-3 system, which is essential for the optimal growth of pathogenic Mycobacteria in low-iron environments.14 They expected that these RNA aptamers would be candidate agents for the diagnosis of TB.14 Additionally, Russell et al. generated slow off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers) with subnanomolar affinity for 18 M. tb protein targets and evaluated their utility for direct antigen detection.15\n",

Baig et al. identified ssDNA aptamers Mtb-Apt1 and Mtb-Apt6 as a novel class of potent inhibitors of M. tb acetohydroxyacid synthase, which has been implicated in bacterial survival.22 Ranjbar et al. designed and constructed a three-dimensional DNA origami box based on MPT64 ssDNA aptamer for tuberculosis treatment.23 They expected that the MPT64 ssDNA aptamer-based drug delivery system would be capable of selectively interfacing with M.tb and would release an anti-TB drug near the bacteria.23\n",

They reported that 10\u2013100 colony-forming units (CFUs) were successfully detected in 9 mL of the chicken rinsate in a pull-down assay.25 Then, aptamer 33 was tested by Ma et al. to generate an electrochemical biosensor for Salmonella detection, and the detection limit turned out to be as low as 3 CFU/mL.26 Aptamer 45 was chosen by Bagheryan et al. to develop a label-free impedimetric aptamer-based biosensor for S.

These bacteria can survive and grow in a wide range of environmental conditions, including refrigeration temperatures (4 \u00b0C). The United Sates FDA and the European Union have all implemented zero-tolerance policies toward L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods, thereby leading to a substantial effort to develop highly sensitive biosensors for foodborne pathogen detection. Thus far, all anti-L. monocytogenes aptamers in recent studies were developed for bacterial detection. Ohk et al. chose internalin A (an invasin protein of L. monocytogenes) as a target molecule to generate ssDNA Aptamer A8. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated A8 was used in a fiber-optic sensor together with an antibody in a sandwich format for the detection of L. monocytogenes in food.55 They demonstrated that A8 detects 103 CFU/mL L. monocytogenes in pure culture and in a mixture with other bacteria as well as L. monocytogenes from artificially contaminated (initial inoculation of 102 CFUs per 25 g) ready-to-eat meat products after 18 h of enrichment.55 Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a cytolysin expressed in L. monocytogenes. Bruno et al. developed an ssDNA aptamer called LLO-3 for the LLO protein.56 The aptamer was then applied to a fluorescent enzyme-linked DNA aptamer-magnetic bead sandwich assay for the detection of Listeria.56 They reported that the assay was highly sensitive, with limits of detection in the range of 4 to 61 L. monocytogenes cells or the equivalent LLO produced by 4\u201361 cells on average per 100 \u03bcL sample in separate titration trials.56\n",

People with chronic HIV-1 infection may have none of the HIV-related symptoms for many years. Therefore, early detection of HIV-1 infection is important for HIV/AIDS treatment. HIV accessory proteins include the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein, which is important for the transcription of viral RNA and enhances the amount of protein produced by attaching itself to the viral RNA.72 The Tat protein is one of the most promising candidates for HIV screening because this protein is released in the body at an early stage of infection.72 Yamamoto et al. first generated an RNA aptamer specific for the HIV-1 Tat protein.73 The aptamer was then used to develop biosensors detecting the Tat protein.74\n,\n75 Another research conducted by Rahim Ruslinda et al. yielded a split RNA aptamer as the detection probe for Tat.76 They demonstrated that the effectiveness of a diamond-FET (field-effect transistor)-based RNA aptamer for the detection of a real sample of HIV-1 Tat protein is at concentrations down to 1 nM.76\n",

Aptamers have been considered an alternative or adjuvant to the chemical antiviral agents in cART. Aptamers specifically targeting various parts of the HIV-1 genome and HIV-1 proteins have been selected and shown to effectively inhibit viral fusion with the target cell and to suppress viral replication. There are some aptamers available for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. 77, 78, 79, 80 One of these RNA aptamers for gp120, called B40, blocks gp120 binding to its T cell co-receptor, CCR5 (C\u2014C chemokine receptor type 5).78\n,\n81 Its shorter variant, B40t77 and modified B40t77 (UCLA1) have been shown to strongly neutralize HIV-1 infectivity.79\n,\n82\n,\n83 Another anti-gp120 aptamer, A-1, was applied to construct a therapeutic aptamer-siRNA chimera for HIV-1, and the chimera was reported to show therapeutic efficacy against of HIV-1 infection in vivo. 80\n,\n84\n,\n85 Recently, new potent anti-HIV-1 ssDNA aptamers that bind to gp120 were obtained by Prokofjeva et al.\n86 They demonstrated that both G-quadruplex(G4)-forming aptamer (F-thio-BclON) and non-G4-forming aptamer (BclON-mut) inhibit lentiviral transduction in the low nanomolar range and thus can be considered for the development of microbicides against HIV-1.86 For inhibiting the HIV-1 replication cycle, reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of the main drug targets in HIV/AIDS. HIV-1 RT catalyzes the conversion of the single-stranded genomic viral RNA into double-stranded proviral DNA, which in turn is integrated into the host genome.87 To date, numerous RNA or DNA aptamers against HIV-1 RT have been generated, and their application to the inhibition of viral replication has been investigated.88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95 Among these anti-RT aptamers, an ssDNA aptamer generated by capillary electrophoresis-SELEX and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoroarabinonucleotide (FANA) aptamer FA1 can strongly bind HIV-1 RT, with low picomolar dissociation constants.90\n,\n95 Besides anti-RT aptamers, highly specific aptamers\u2014that target various parts of the HIV-1 genome, the trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA element, or HIV-1 integrase, nucleocapsid, Gag or Rev proteins\u2014have been isolated and shown to effectively suppress viral replication.96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106\n",

For inhibiting HCV initial attachment to host cells as well as to develop agents for the early diagnosis of HCV infection, our group carried out cell surface-SELEX and generated ssDNA aptamer ZE2 that binds specifically to HCV surface glycoprotein E2.108 A good correlation was observed among HCV patients between the HCV E2 antigen-aptamer (ZE2) assay and the assays for HCV RNA quantities or HCV antibody detection.108 Additionally, aptamer ZE2 specifically captures HCV particles and significantly inhibits HCV cell culture (HCVcc) infection of human hepatocytes (Huh7.5.1) in vitro.108 We can speculate that ZE2 may be beneficial as a new molecular probe for HCV detection as well as anti-HCV therapy. Other research groups reported aptamers against HCV core (C) antigen for HCV detection.109, 110, 111 Ghanbari et al. immobilized an anti-C antigen aptamer onto graphene quantum dots (GOD), and the aptamer-GOD was placed on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode.111 They demonstrated that the electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor effectively detects the HCV C antigen with the detection limit of 3.3 pg/mL.111 These aptamers against HCV E2 and C antigens are crucial for the early diagnosis of hepatitis C within the \u201cdiagnostic window period,\u201d when serum antibodies have not appeared yet.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses cause respiratory diseases in birds and mammals. The three major types of influenza viruses are influenza A, B, and C. The influenza A virus leads to seasonal epidemics as well as sporadic pandemics of influenza, and hence it is regarded as the major cause of this acute infectious disease and deaths. In recent years, influenza rapid diagnostic tests became available. Most of these diagnostic tests are based on detection influenza antigens by antibodies.126 However, aptamers currently are viewed as equal or better tools compared with antibodies for antigen identification.127 The hemagglutinin (HA) antigen is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of influenza viruses and serves as the major target for aptamers. The HA antigen also facilitates the first stage of the influenza virus infection: the binding to a species-specific host cell in the respiratory epithelium. Thus far, more than 10 aptamers against HA have been developed for diagnostic purposes.128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139 RNA aptamer P30-10-16 binds to HA (human influenza A virus subtype H3N2) with more than 15-fold stronger affinity as compared with a conventional anti-HA monoclonal antibody.130 Bai et al. developed a portable SPR aptasensor (an aptamer-based biosensor) based on the specific DNA aptamer for the rapid detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1. The total detection time was < 1.5 h, which is faster than all conventional methods for AIV detection, such as virus isolation and identification (5\u20137 days), ELISA (3 h), and RT-PCT (3\u20135 h).140 Wang et al. selected an ssDNA aptamer against HA from AIV H5N1, and the K\nd value of this aptamer was 4.65 nM.136 The anti-HA aptamer was later immobilized onto a gold interdigitated microelectrode for the development of a rapid H5N1 detection method, and the method had the detection limit of 1 hemagglutination unit (HAU) in the tracheal chicken swab samples spiked with the H5N1 virus.141 Other aptamers for influenza virus detection target whole virus particles.142, 143, 144 Lai et al. carried out screening and found an influenza A virus-specific aptamer,142 which was later incorporated into an integrated microfluidic chip for H1N1 detection, and the limit of detection was found to be 0.032 HAU.143\n",

In a FRET process, fluorescent particles are donors and quencher particles are acceptors. The fluorescence of the donors can be quenched by the acceptors if they come close to each other (< 10 nM).162 A quencher is usually attached to the complementary sequence of the aptamer. Thus, the fluorescence of the aptamer can be quenched due to the good overlap between the fluorescence emission of the aptamer and the absorption spectrum of the complementary sequence. When an aptamer binds to the target, the quencher is moved away from the fluorophore owing to the conformational change of the aptamer and affords \u201csignal on\u201d detection.",

These detection systems do not require additional labeling. In an SPR-based system, aptamers are usually labeled with biotin and immobilized on a streptavidin coated gold chip. The binding between targets and the aptamers leads to a change in the plasmon resonance and plasmon angle, which can be measured (Fig. 4\nA).140 Both SAW aptasensors and QCM aptasensors are acoustic wave sensors. SAW aptasensors record the phase shift and amplitude change due to the binding of targets to surface-immobilized aptamers (Fig. 4B).168 In a QCM aptasensor system, aptamers are loaded onto gold-coated quartz. The binding of targets to aptamers causes an increase of the mass on the surface of the crystal and generates a detectable decrease in the resonance frequency of the crystal.169\n",

Cross-binding to non-target molecules may limit the use of aptamers for detection in many real world complex samples, such as biological fluids and food matrices. Therefore, careful design of the selection process is necessary to improve specificity of the identified aptamers, which can better distinguish closely related molecules at low concentrations. High variation of bacteria and viruses and complex structures of targets are additional factors that may influence the performance of aptamers. It is important to continue to develop simpler and more efficient SELEX procedures (requiring less time in selection) to develop specific and/or universal aptamers against various bacterial pathogens.",
