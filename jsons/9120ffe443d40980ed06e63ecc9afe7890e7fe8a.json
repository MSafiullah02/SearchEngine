A synthetic mercury-containing esterase inhibitor and receptor analogue, 9-acetamidosialic acid -thiomethylmercuryglycoside, was designed as the single isomorphous heavy-atom derivative. The asymmetric unit of one crystal form (form I; P4 3 22, a = b = 155.4, c = 414.4 A \u00ca ) contained an HEF trimer. Six mercury sites identifying the three haemagglutination and three esterase sites were located by difference Patterson map analysis of a 6.5 A \u00ca resolution derivative data set. These positions de\u00aened the molecular threefold-symmetry axis of the HEF trimer. A molecular envelope was de\u00aened by averaging a 7.0 A \u00ca resolution electron-density map, phased by single isomorphous replacement (SIR), about the non-crystallographic threefold-symmetry axis. Iterative non-crystallographic symmetry averaging in real space, solvent\u00afattening and histogram matching were used to extend the phases to 3.5 A \u00ca resolution. Molecular replacement of the model into a second crystal form (form II; P4 3 2 1 2, a = b = 217.4, c = 421.4 A \u00ca ) containing two HEF trimers per asymmetric unit permitted iterative ninefold averaging of the electron density. The 3.5 A \u00ca electron-density map allowed an unambiguous tracing of the polypeptide chain and identi\u00aecation of N-linked carbohydrates. The model has been re\u00aened by least squares to 3.2 A \u00ca resolution (R free = 26.7%).",

            "text": "In\u00afuenza C virus is a lipid-enveloped orthomyxovirus which causes respiratory infections in humans. Many strains of in\u00afuenza C virus appear to circulate simultaneously, causing occasional outbreaks of disease, especially in children (Katagiri et al., 1983; Air & Compans, 1983) , but not the familiar periodic epidemics and pandemics caused by in\u00afuenza A and B viruses (Katagiri et al., 1983; Air & Compans, 1983) . The virus membrane contains multiple copies of a single 225 kDa trimeric glycoprotein arranged in an open hexagonal array (Herrler et al., 1981; Hewat et al., 1984) . This haemagglutininesterase-fusion glycoprotein (HEF) has three activities essential for viral infectivity: receptor binding, receptordestroying enzyme activity and membrane fusion. Like the HA glycoprotein of in\u00afuenza A and B viruses, HEF is synthesized as a single-chain precursor HEF 0 , which is cleaved post-translationally into the disul\u00aede-linked polypeptides HEF 1 and HEF 2 . This cleavage is required for the protein to be able to undergo a conformational change, triggered by the low pH in endosomes, which initiates the fusion of virus and cell membranes that effects viral entry. The HEF 1 polypeptide contains the binding site for the 9-O-acetylsialic acid cell receptor and a distinct receptor-destroying, 9-O-acetylsialic acid esterase active site (Pleschka et al., 1995) . Thus, HEF contains the three activities which are distributed on two glycoproteins in in\u00afuenza A and B viruses, where the HA protein has the receptor-binding and membrane-fusion activities and the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein has the receptor-destroying activity. Though similar in structure to the haemagglutinin (HA) of in\u00afuenza A, HEF (641 residues) and HA (512 residues) share less than 15% sequence identity (Nakada et al., 1984; Pfeifer & Compans, 1984) . A glycoprotein on the membrane of both coronaviruses and toroviruses, the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE; $409 residues), has 30% sequence identity to HEF 1 of in\u00afuenza C virus and possesses the same receptor binding and esterase speci\u00aecities (Luytjes et al., 1988; Vlasak et al., 1988; King et al., 1985) . Coronaviruses cause approximately 25% of common colds in humans (Cornelissen et al., 1997; Monto & Lim, 1974; McIntosh et al., 1970) .",

            "text": "Crystallization of HEF and X-ray data collection on the native HEF ectodomain from two tetragonal crystal forms [form I, P4 1(3) 22, a = b = 155.4, c = 414.4 A \u00ca and form II, P4 1(3) 2 1 2, a = b = 217.4, c = 421.4 A \u00ca ] using\u00afash cooling and synchrotron radiation have been described previously . The two crystal forms have approximately 80% solvent content and one and two HEF trimers per asymmetric unit, respectively . An enzyme inhibitor and receptor analogue which would bind in both the receptor and enzyme active sites was designed with an acetamido group substituted for the 9-O-acetyl group on the viral receptor 9-O-acetylsialic acid (Imhof et al., 1988; Herrler et al., 1992; . A mercury adduct of this inhibitor, 9-acetamidosialic acid -thiomethylmercuryl glycoside, was synthesized and found to form an isomorphous heavy-atom derivative (Fitz et al., 1996; Rosenthal et al., 1998) . The structure of HEF at 3.2 A \u00ca has been described elsewhere (Rosenthal et al., 1998) ; methods used in the structure determination are described here. Attempts to use the lowhomology (<15% sequence identity) in\u00afuenza A virus HA structure for molecular replacement were unsuccessful. Instead, initial SIR phases were calculated at 7.0 A \u00ca resolution from six mercury sites located by Patterson map analysis of X-ray data on the mercury derivative collected to 6.5 A \u00ca resolution. The non-crystallographic threefold-symmetry axis of the HEF trimer was de\u00aened by the mercury positions. Averaging the electron-density map calculated from SIR phases around the molecular threefold-symmetry axis revealed an approximate molecular envelope. Iterative noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in real space, solvent attening and histogram matching were used to extend the phases from 7.0 to 3.5 A \u00ca . The path of the polypeptide could be traced in this electron-density map and an atomic model was built. A polyalanine model was then used to solve the form II crystal containing two trimers per asymmetric unit, allowing multi-crystal averaging of the electron density. Re\u00aenement, using data to 3.2 A \u00ca , has resulted in a free R factor of 26.7% and an R work of 22.3%.",

Searches for the non-crystallographic molecular threefold axis were performed using both reciprocal-and real-space methods. [Model calculations using the in\u00afuenza A HA structure placed in different orientations in a model P4 1(3) 22 unit cell indicated that the correct threefold self-rotation function peak could be found in model data using the X-PLOR (Bru \u00c8 nger, 1992b) real-space rotation function searching with a 25\u00b150 A \u00ca vector annulus of the Patterson.] Fig. 1 shows the top four X-PLOR self-rotation Acta Cryst. Stereographic projection of the threefold self-rotation function peaks from form I and form II crystals. Pattersons analyzed were from data in the 7.0\u00b14.0 A \u00ca resolution annulus; vectors were restricted to the length range 25\u00b150 A \u00ca . The lattices of crystal form I and crystal form II are related by a 45 rotation about the c axis, as shown. Peaks 1, 2 and 3 are packing artifacts (see text). Peak 4 de\u00aenes the molecular threefoldsymmetry axis. A rotation axis is speci\u00aeed by (3, 9) where 3 is the angle between the c axis and the rotation axis and 9 is the angle between the projection of the rotation axis onto the ab plane and the a axis. function peaks for HEF crystal forms I and II. The unit cells of these crystal forms are related by a 45 rotation about their common c axes, as described previously . Peaks 1, 2 and 3 in each space group appear to be a consequence of the superposition of crystal packing vectors, as they were also found as the top peaks using the observed Figure 3 Harker sections in the mercury difference Patterson maps. The mercury compound is described in Fig. 2(b) . The Patterson was calculated with 15\u00b16.5 A \u00ca data. Peaks on sections w = 1 2 and w = 1 4 are related by mirror symmetry across the diagonal. The asymmetric units of the v = 0 and u = v sections are shown. The Harker peaks from the six mercury positions summarized in Table 2 are indicated by the corresponding numbers. Cross vectors close to the Harker sections are marked as`X'. intensities randomized with respect to Miller indices (hkl) within resolution shells, thus preserving the intensity pro\u00aele as a function of resolution similar to the original data (Jones, Walker et al., 1991) . This suggested that peaks 1\u00b13 were rotation-function artifacts and that peak 4, common to both space groups, identi\u00aeed the orientations of the molecular threefold-symmetry axes (3 = 63, 9 = 20 ; Fig. 1 angle conventions). The subsequent determination of the location of heavy-atom derivatives labeling the three receptor-binding and three enzyme active sites con\u00aermed this orientation of the non-crystallographic symmetry axis.",

Although several cross-rotation function peaks were near the self-rotation peak, no signi\u00aecant translation-function peaks were found. To investigate whether searches with lower resolution data (not actually measured) might have been successful, low-resolution data were calculated from the \u00aenal model and solvent correction added. A real-space cross-rotation function calculation with model data in the resolution range 40\u00b110 A \u00ca using X-PLOR (Bru \u00c8 nger, 1992b) contained the approximately correct orientation within the top ten peaks (no solution was evident in 100\u00b110 A \u00ca resolution data). However, no solution closer than 30 A \u00ca to the correct location was found by translation-function searches with X-PLOR (Bru \u00c8 nger, 1992b). To investigate further why the molecular-replacement searches with the HA structure were unsuccessful, the HA structure was placed at the location of the \u00aenal HEF structure and re\u00aened against the HEF data, allowing each polypeptide to move as a rigid body. This re\u00aened model has a correlation coef\u00aecient of 0.22 and an R factor of 53% against the HEF data in the resolution range 15.0\u00b13.5 A \u00ca . The mean phase error between the re\u00aened HEF structure and the HA model is 89 . When the HA model was placed at incorrect locations in the form I unit cell, the correlation coef\u00aecient was 0.20 and the R factor was 55%. The structural differences between HEF and HA are signi\u00aecant. Although the structure of individual sequence segments of the two proteins can be individually superimposed quite closely (Rosenthal et al., 1998) , when the full structures are compared, inter-domain movements over the length of the large molecule contribute to r.m.s. discrepancies between C positions of 11 A \u00ca between HEF 1 and HA 1 and 9 A \u00ca between HEF 2 and HA 2 , excluding HEF segments not present in HA.

In addition to factors such as non-isomorphism, we anticipated a poor signalto-noise ratio for the mercury difference Patterson owing to the large molecular mass of protein in the asymmetric unit (225 kDa). The six mercury positions were located by a combination of manual and computational searches of the Patterson map. Beginning with some prominent peaks on the Harker sections, a few tentative sites were assigned, which were con\u00aermed by searches for the cross vectors among the sites using the Patterson search program RSPS (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) . A combination of further Patterson searches and difference Fourier calculations located the full six expected sites. The location of the Harker vectors of the six mercury sites are marked on the four Harker sections (Fig. 3) . Cross vectors which overlap with or are close to the Harker sections are marked with an`X' in Fig. 3 . Distances between the sites indicated that they formed two equilateral triangles, as anticipated for the two sialosidebinding sites on each monomer of the trimeric HEF. The difference Fourier electron-density maps skewed for viewing normal to the planes of the triangles are shown in Fig. 4 .

An SIR electrondensity map was threefold averaged about the molecular symmetry axis without an envelope and folded back into the asymmetric unit using RAVE (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) . This map was back-transformed to calculate structures factors which were input to the program DM for determining the solvent mask in a unit cell (Cowtan, 1994) . The mask about one molecule was isolated by averaging the DM solvent mask around a molecular threefold axis using RAVE (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) . Positions in the DM mask not reinforced by the local threefold averaging were set to zero with MAPMAN (Jones, Zou et al., 1991) . The mask was enlarged and smoothed by \u00aeve-point interpolation at its boundaries (MAMA; Kleywegt & Jones, 1996a,b) . Internal`islands' were removed and crystallographic packing overlaps minimized using MAMA.

At each resolution step, the electron-density map was back-transformed to calculate phases for slightly higher resolution Fourier terms than were used to calculate the map. Electron-density maps calculated with the incrementally higher resolution terms were improved by 20 cycles of threefold NCS averaging in real space, solvent attening and histogram matching using DM (Cowtan, 1994) . ' A weighting (Free-Sim mode in DM) was used to combine phases between the iterative cycles. A total of 50 phaseextension steps were used, which included 20 0.1 A \u00ca steps from 7.0 to 5.0 A \u00ca and 30 0.05 A \u00ca steps from 5.0 to 3.5 A \u00ca (each resolution increment was less than the interval between lattice points along the longest unit-cell axis). At resolutions of 6.0, 5.0 and 4.0 A \u00ca , the NCS operators were redetermined using a six-dimensional search for the maximum correlation NCSrelated electron density. The progress of the phase-extension process was monitored by the DM free-R indicator and the correlation coef\u00aecient between the observed amplitudes and those calculated from the map ( Table 3 ). The \u00aenal phase-extended electron density calculated at 3.5 A \u00ca had good correlation coef\u00aecients in all resolution shells (Fig. 8) and showed clearly interpretable protein features including long -helices in the stem region (Fig. 9c ) and a -barrel in the top globular domain (Fig. 9g) .

Diffraction data collected to 4.0 A \u00ca resolution from crystal form II, which contains two HEF trimers per asymmetric unit, permitted iterative ninefold averaging to 4.0 A \u00ca resolution of electrondensity maps from form I and form II crystals. The location of the HEF trimers in the form II crystals was determined by using a polyalanine model of the unre\u00aened HEF trimer and the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). A cross-Acta Cryst. rotation function indicated trimers at the same orientation as in crystal form I but rotated 45 about the c axis, as expected . The top rotation-function peak (8.7') gave a translation-function solution in P4 3 2 1 2 with a correlation coef\u00aecient of 0.23 (18.9'). With the \u00aerst trimer \u00aexed, the second trimer was located in a translation function (49.5') at a relative translation vector of (0.481, 0.498, 0.005) in fractional coordinates. This displacement is a pseudo-Ccentering translation ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0) between the two trimers in the asymmetric unit, consistent with a peak in the native Patterson function of the form II crystals . Rigid-body re\u00aenement of both trimers yielded a correlation coef\u00aecient of 0.38 and an R factor of 0.48. Side-chain electron densities consistent with the HEF sequence were evident in a 2F o \u00c0 F c map calculated from the polyalanine model.",

Structure factors calculated from this electron-density map were used with the program DM for 20 cycles of iterative sixfold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging in real space, solvent\u00afattening and histogram matching. The molecular envelopes for this procedure were calculated from the model from the form I crystal with ENVAT (Madden, 1992) , extended in the regions where the original model was expected to be incomplete with MAMA (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996b) , and trimmed to avoid symmetry overlaps using the program NCSMASK (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) . A monomer mask was used for non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and a mask surrounding both trimers was used for solvent\u00afattening. The improved sixfold-averaged electron-density map from the form II crystal was combined with the threefold-averaged electron-density map calculated prior to model re\u00aenement from the form I crystals in 20 cycles of iterative ninefold averaging in real space, solvent\u00afattening and histogram matching of monomer density in both crystal forms using the program DMmulti (Cowtan, 1994) .

Of the two potential oligosaccharide sites which lacked any potential oligosaccharide electron density, one, Asn117, is in the rarely glycosylated sequence Asn\u00b1 Trp\u00b1Ser\u00b1Pro (Shakin-Eshleman et al., 1996; Katsuri et al., 1997; Gavel & von Heijne, 1990 ) and the other, Asn157 of HEF 2 , is near the C-terminus of HEF 2 where the model B factors are high and the electron density is poor, suggesting that the disorder of this region is obscuring the oligosaccharide electron density.

A higher resolution native data set (an EMTS soak at 3 mM, Table 1 , \u00c1F/F = 0.08) consisting of data between 5.5 and 3.2 A \u00ca were merged with the native data from 10 to 3.5 A \u00ca .

The HEF 2 polypeptide HEF 2 is dominated by two antiparallel -helices, the \u00aerst preceded by two antiparallel -strands (Fig. 17g ) and the second followed by two antiparallel -strands (Fig. 17h) . The \u00aerst 24 residues which precede the two -strands contain the non-polar fusion peptide implicated in the membrane-fusion activity of the HEF. The electron density for residues 1\u00b15 of HEF 2 is poor probably owing to disorder of this region. Residues 13\u00b118 of HEF 2 are sandwiched between N-terminal (9\u00b113) and C-terminal (424\u00b1427) residues of HEF 1 . The two antiparallel -strands (residues 23\u00b129 and 37\u00b139) are part of a \u00aeve-stranded -sheet at the bottom of the HEF stem, the central strand of which is from the N-terminal of HEF 1 (residues 3\u00b111; Figs. 17g, 17h; red in Fig. 18b) . A 6 2 3 -turn, 34 A \u00ca long -helix runs towards the top of the stem domain, followed by a 15-residue hairpin loop which reverses the direction of the chain (Fig. 17g ). An 11-turn, $60 A \u00ca long -helix (residues 82\u00b1124) runs towards the viral membrane end of the stem. Near the end of the second -strands following the long helix, Cys137 of HEF 2 is disul\u00aede bonded to Cys6 of HEF 1 , forming the only covalent link between HEF 1 and HEF 2 (Fig. 17h ). An internal disul\u00aede loop from HEF 2 145\u00b1149 precedes a short -helix before the polypeptide turns toward the viral end of the molecule. The electron-density map could not be interpreted beyond residue 165. The transmembrane anchor starts about 20 residues after 165.",

About 60% (2488 A \u00ca 2 ) of this buried surface is HEF 2 and 40% (1566 A \u00ca 2 ) is HEF 1 . The prominent triple-stranded -helical interface at the core of the stalk domain accounts for only about 13% of the interface (321 A \u00ca 2 ) formed by HEF 2 . This re\u00afects the fact that the central helices diverge from each over both the top and bottom third of their lengths. The space on the threefold-symmetry axis between the top segments of the central helices is occupied by electron density which appears to be ions or water molecules (Rosenthal et al., 1998) . The space between the top of the two long -helices from adjacent HEF 2 monomers is \u00aelled by the long loop between the two helices of one HEF 2 monomer. This loop forms a substantial part of the HEF 2 \u00b1 HEF 2 interface ($600 A \u00ca 2 ). The space between the long -helices of HEF 2 at bottom third of these helices is \u00aelled by the HEF 2 -strand residues 133\u00b1135. After the low-pH-induced conformational change which activates the membrane-fusion activity, the loop and -sheet residues forming these HEF 2 \u00b1HEF 2 interfaces are expected to change positions radically, based on the precedent of the structurally related HA molecule (Bullough et al., 1994) .",
