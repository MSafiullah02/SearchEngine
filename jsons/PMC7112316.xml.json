Analysis of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases can lead to the better methodologies to slow their transmission. Since the start of twentieth century, a lot of work has been done on construction of epidemic models for infectious diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, gonorrhea, influenza, malaria, rabies, rubella, whooping cough and SARS. Models have also been developed for sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, HIV/AIDS, and child diseases like measles and polio. These models ranges from simple curve fitting models to standard compartmental models [1] (MSEIR,MSEIRS,SEIJR,SIR,SIRS, SEIR,SEIS,SI, and SIS etc.) to complex stochastic models. Fast computer systems and the availability of huge data bases has made it possible to use complex mathematical models to analyze the data.",

In 1906, Hamer constructed and analyzed a discrete time model in order to understand the reoccurrence of measles epidemics. His model was probably the first to assume that the incidence (number of new cases per unit time) depends on the product of the densities of the susceptibles and infectives [9]. Ross [9] was interested in the prevalence and control of malaria and he developed deterministic model for malaria as a host-vector disease in 1911. Other deterministic epidemiological models were then developed by Ross, Ross and Hudson, Martini and Lotka [9]. Kermack and McKendrick are considered as the pioneers in mathematical modeling in epidemiology with the publication of a series of papers in 1926. In their work they calculated the epidemic threshold and showed that an outbreak of an epidemic could occur only if the number of susceptible individuals exceed the critical value called the reproduction number. Mathematical epidemiology seems to have grown rapidly since then as a large variety of models have been formulated, mathematically analyzed and applied to infectious diseases [9]. The first edition of Bailey\u2019s book, which appeared in 1957, is an important landmark in the history of mathematical biology [9].",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is one of the recently emerged infectious diseases. This is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV). It was in November 2002, when the first case of SARS was diagnosed in the Chinese province of Guangdong. At the end of February 2003, the SARS epidemic spread around the world, when a medical doctor from Guangdong infected several persons in a hotel in Kowloon. SARS also spread globally through air travel. According to the estimates of WHO,8450 people were infected and 810 deaths were recorded due to SARS in 33 countries on 5 continents [15]. Although this outbreak of the disease was brought under control at the end of 2003, many separate outbreaks of SARS appeared in Singapore, Taiwan and China. The main reason for this was the release of SARS\u2013CoV accidently from laboratories [15]. The animals infected by the SARS\u2013CoV strain also infected humans and at the start of 2004 some new cases of this disease came to notice. Both incidents show the danger of SARS outbreak at any time in the near future, either by SARS\u2013CoV virus evolving from SARS\u2013CoV-like virus from animals or by virus from laboratory samples. There is a SARS\u2013CoV-like virus, also found in animals, but it is not transferable and thus cannot cause SARS-like disease. It is possible that under special circumstances, this virus may get converted into the early human SARS\u2013CoV, with an ability to transfer from animals to humans [8].",

In the beginning, epidemiologist, tried to find out the reasons for the cause and spread of SARS. They tried to find measures to control it, but the main emphasis was on research work concerned with the biological properties of the corona virus [16]. Some work was done to investigate the transmission dynamics and the effect of various control measures. Most of the study on SARS was done in China, where the SARS epidemic hit the hardest. This work was published in Chinese journals, which were poorly accessible to international researchers. Xia et al. [17] analyzed the pattern of SARS and predicted the course of the SARS epidemic by establishing a compartmental model using data from Guangdong and Hong Kong. Chowell et al. [5] fitted an SEIJR model for SARS epidemic for the data from Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore. Chowell predicted the behavior of the disease and the role of diagnosis and isolation as a control mechanism in these regions showing the difference between the epidemic dynamics occurred in these three cities. Yang et al. [19] established a compartmental model to describe the SARS epidemic in spatial\u2013temporal dimensions determining whether people traveling in buses and trains infect one another or not. They concluded that SARS can spread through people traveling in buses and trains. In their SEIR models based on data from Beijing and Hong Kong, Wu et al. [14] and Chen et al. [4] estimated the source of super-spreading events of SARS with the calculation of the reproductive rate of the disease based on data from Beijing and Hong Kong.",

Four different initial conditions are taken for the population distribution. The equation governing the system are solved numerically using operator splitting method. The reproduction number R0 is calculated for the disease. It is shown that disease dies out for R0<1, in disease free equilibrium. It however prevails for endemic equilibrium, where R0>1 as shown in Table 11\n. Stability of solutions with and without diffusion is established using Routh\u2013Hurwitz conditions as shown in Tables Table 2, Table 3\nThe value of the reproduction number R0 depends on ten parameters. The parameters transmission coefficient \u03b2, recovery rate in infectious class \u03b31 and recovery coefficient in diagnosed \u03b32 have been varied to observe the effects on the spread of disease. Hence four cases are produced to see the effect on the spread of disease. Bifurcation values of transmission coefficient \u03b2 and recovery coefficients \u03b31 and \u03b32 are calculated. It is observed that diffusion causes an increase in the bifurcation value of \u03b2 and a decrease in the value of recovery coefficients. This shows that the system can be stable for larger value of \u03b2 and smaller values of recovery rates \u03b31 and \u03b32 in the presence of diffusion.",

Similarly the exposed remain confined in the interval [-1,1.5] in the absence of diffusion. But with diffusion population outside the domain [-1,1.5] also become exposed to infection and after ten days exposed population spread to whole domain. With and without diffusion in the system, infection reached to its peak in first ten days. With the inclusion of diffusion, however, infection spreads over the whole domain [-2,2]. Recovered also follows the same pattern. Numerical solution of initial condition (ii), as shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 8, follows the same pattern as in condition (i) with only difference in concentration of population in different domain. In the absence of diffusion infective population fluctuate inside the domain [-.5,.5], but with diffusion in the system fluctuations follows with the spread in the whole domain after ten days Numerical solution with initial condition (iii), as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 9, shows the main concentration of susceptible shifts slightly to right of domain [0,2] in 20 days. Infected move to domain [0,2] from domain [-2,0] and with that diagnosed and recovered also follow the same pattern. With diffusion in the system Susceptible start spreading to the left of the domain [-2,2] but are mainly confined in [-0.8,2]. Exposed grows in the smaller domain [-1,0.5] first and then with passage of time spread in the domain [-1.5,2]. Infected shifts their domain from [-2,0] to [-1,2] followed with decrease, increase and then again decrease in proportion. Thus with diffusion more individuals get infected within a short time and infection spreads quickly and reaches its maximum in 15 days covering almost the whole domain. In the absence of diffusion the maximum number of infected are observed after twenty days in domain [0,1], reflecting the intensity of infection more than that with diffusion during the same time. A large proportion of population is recovered with diffusion in the system during the same time as compared to without diffusion. Numerical solution with initial condition (iv), as shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 10, demonstrate that diffusion causes the infection to spread out from domain [-.7,.7] to [-2,2]. The intensity of the infection also becomes less than the initial intensity as it spreads to [-1.5,1.5].",
