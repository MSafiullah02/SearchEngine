Nevertheless the pandemic is expected to have an impact on the capacity to deliver paediatric radiotherapy, particularly where general anaesthesia is required, due to shortages of personnel, protective equipment, ventilators and machine time, as well as coping infected children and families[5], [6]. Sudden shortage of resources may also occur during other natural disasters and following machine failures, including particle beam facilities7. Limited radiotherapy resources are a major obstacle in improving outcomes in low- and middle-income countries where more than two-thirds of paediatric cancers are diagnosed8.",
