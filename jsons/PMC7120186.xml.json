            "text": "The generic term sialic acid defines a large family of 9-carbon monosaccharides which commonly occur as terminal residues of the oligosaccharide moiety of glycoconjugates. The diversity of sialic acids results from differential N- and O-substitutions of the two basic molecules, i.e., N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). The most common modification of sialic acids is O-acetylation preferentially at the hydroxyl groups of carbon C4, C7, C8, and C9, whereas that at C9 seems to be the most frequent one.",

Even by taking special care to avoid the loss of O-acetyl groups during the purification and analysis process of sialoglycans, results may lead to an underestimation of their O-acetylation. Exposure of O-Ac-Sias to moderate alkaline conditions results in migration of acetyl groups from carbon C7 to carbons C8 or C9 [1, 2]. Procedures for isolation of gangliosides often involve incubation with NaOH to remove phospholipids, which results in a complete loss of O-acetyl groups due to saponification.",

            "text": "Histochemical staining with mild periodic acid-Schiff reaction (mPAS) is a general method to detect sialic acids. O-Ac-Sias with acetyl groups at C-8 or C-9 do not react under these conditions, but will stain after saponification with NaOH [3]. Mild oxidation in combination with detection of liberated formaldehyde with acetyl-acetone and ammonium acetate, yielding a fluorogen, has been described as a sensitive method to determine sialic acid concentration. After removal of O-acetyl groups at C-8 and C-9, an increase in formaldehyde production can be observed, which allows an indirect quantitative determination of O-Ac-Sias [4]. Lectins from the crab Cancer antennarius [5] and Achatinin-H derived from the snail Achatina fulica [6, 7] were shown to bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias. Viral lectins have also been used to detect this sialic acid derivative. The influenza C virus surface hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein termed HEF specifically binds to 9-O-Ac-Sias [8\u201310]. Influenza C virus preparations were used to stain cells and tissues of different sources [11\u201318]. To avoid the use of infectious virus, the influenza C virus surface glycoprotein was expressed as a chimeric protein fused to an Fc immunoglobulin domain [19] or to enhanced green fluorescent protein [20]. The chimeric proteins are useful to remove specifically 9-O-acetyl groups from sialic acids [10, 19\u201327]. The chimeric protein was also useful as lectin: by inhibition of the esterase domain with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a general serine hydrolase inhibitor, the lectin function of the CHE-Fc protein was employed to detect 9-O-Ac-Sias [19, 25, 28, 29].",

For analysis of O-Ac-Sias the acidic hydrolysis of glycosidically bound sialic acids should be performed with propionic instead of acetic acid [37]. The presence of O-Ac-Sias can be determined by their respective Rf values [38]. In biological samples carboxyl groups of other compounds may result in additional peaks in chromatograms. Therefore, the presence of O-Ac-Sias in HPLC peaks should be confirmed by saponification, specific de-O-acetylation with influenza C virus esterase (for Neu5,9Ac2) or rat coronavirus esterase for Neu4,5Ac2, or by mass spectrometry. The position of side groups of sialic acids can be determined by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) [39\u201343]. Very recently another highly sensitive method to identify different forms of O-acetylated sialic acids by electrospray ionization travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry coupled with low-energy collision-induced dissociation was described, allowing unambiguous assignment of the position of O-acetylation [44].",

            "text": "Sialic acids are constituents of different opportunistic human pathogens. Bacteria can obtain sialic acids by either de novo biosynthesis or by acquisition from the environment. Different Gram negative bacteria like Escherichia coli K1, Neisseria meningitidis, and Campylobacter jejuni, and Gram positive bacteria like Group B Streptococcus (GBS) can synthesize sialic acids [45]. Sialic acid uptake in other Gram negative bacteria like Haemophilus Influenza, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from exogenous sources has recently been established [45, 46]. These bacteria use their sialic acids for a variety of different purposes that play important roles in their ability to colonize and persist in organs of their hosts. For instance, sialic acids were shown to subvert immune clearance mechanisms by restricting complement C3b deposition on its surface [47]. Once synthesized, sialic acid residues in the capsular polysaccharide or oligosaccharide of E. coli K1, GBS serogroup III, N. meningitidis, one or more of the hydroxyl groups in positions 4, 7, 8, and 9 are substituted by acetyl groups [48]. Sia O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation is regulated by the gene neuD and neuA, respectively, to reach a final level of the surface expressed O-Ac-Sia modification [47, 49, 50]. In addition to neuD, which O-acetylates monomeric sialic acid, E. coli K1 strains harboring the prophage CUS-3 express neuO, a polysialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase [51, 52]. Expression of neuO is regulated by phase variation [53]. In E. coli K1 strains O-acetylation increases immunogenicity of the K1 capsule and correlates with increased virulence in patients [54]. O-Acetylation of polySia increases desiccation resistance, which may favor survival in the environment [55]. In N. meningitides the genes for O-acetyltransferases are located immediately downstream of the capsule synthesis genes siaA \u2013 siaD [48] and termed oatC and oatWY [48, 56, 57].",

During the disease manifestation of visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, increased presence of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids is observed in virulent strains of Leishmania sp., indicating their probable relevance in pathogenesis. In contrast minimal or undetectable presence of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on a virulent strain of UR6 also signifies the role of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotope as markers of virulence [78, 81]. The function of parasite-associated 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for entry of promastigotes into macrophages has been demonstrated in comparison to the minimal internalization of de-O-acetylated promastigotes. Analysis of the sialylation during the differentiation of internalized virulent promastigotes into amastigotes indicates that 9-O-acetylated sialic acids not only facilitate promastigote-entry but also play a probable role in differentiation and persistence of infection [81]. Additionally, increased presence of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids during metacyclic stages of virulent promastigotes has pointed to the direct correlation between the association of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids and virulence. Apart from being a marker of virulence, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids also play an important role in conferring nitric oxide resistance in virulent Leishmania sp. having enhanced distribution of the sialoglycotope. Furthermore they also influence the intracellular survival of the parasite within macrophages and modulate the host responses in their favor as evidenced by decreased level of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, the signature TH1 cytokines [81]. In contrast, macrophages show increased levels of these cytokines, when they are infected with de-O-acetylated promastigotes. This observation suggests that the parasite is capable of modulating the host responses via 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for the successful infection. Apparently they act as effective ligands whose expression supports parasite internalization, intracellular differentiation.",

The presence of N-acetyltransferase in L. amazonensis has indicated the presence of enzymes for acetylation [84]. However, any such claim for the presence of O-acetyltransferase requires the identification of the respective genes that, at present, is lacking.

Knockout of sialyltransferase ST8Sia1, also known as GD3 synthase, resulted in a complete absence of b and c series gangliosides. These mice appeared to undergo normal development and had a normal life span. Double knockout mice with an additional disruption of the GalNAcT gene encoding \u03b21,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase, thereby expressing GM3 as the sole ganglioside, were extremely sensitive to sound stimuli even leading to sudden death [87]. Mice with a knockout of the ST6Gal1 gene exhibited tissue specific alterations in sialylation, concomitant with highly selective losses of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid residues [88]. Knockout of polysialyltransferase ST8Sia4 allowed for the first time a discrimination of the roles of neural cell adhesion molecule protein and polysialic acid in neural development and synaptic plasticity [89]. Addition of polysialic acid is an important modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, directing migration and differentiation of neuronal cells within the central nervous system [90]. Recent investigations point to a role of polysialic acids in the development of social interactions and aggression in mice [91].",

Mouse embryos constitutively expressing the esterase were arrested as early as in the two cell stage [92]. In the rat nervous system the 9-O-acetylated ganglioside GD3 (9-O-AcGD3) was shown to exhibit discrete patterns during neuronal development [30]. In the fetal mouse cortex 9-O-acetylated ganglioside GT3 is strongly expressed and decreases to undetectable levels after birth [93]. In another study glycolipid-bound Neu5,9Ac2 was highest in embryonic mouse brain E13, and gradually decreased until birth. Significant amounts of Neu5,9Ac2 were found in adult mouse brain in the glycolipid fractions of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and telencephalon [40]. In pig brain, an increase of Neu5,9Ac2 was observed during the maturation of the cortex and cerebellum [94]. In patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 and Fisher\u00b4s syndromes, which are manifested as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies, antibodies against O-acetylated gangliosides were found [95]. For 9-O-Ac-GD3, roles in neuronal motility were suggested [96, 97]. Antibodies to 9-O-Ac-GD3 induce microtubule depolymerization in growing neurits [98], and 9-O-Ac-GD3 was found in point contacts of neuronal growth cones [99]. Cerebellar granule neuron migration was blocked by the 9-O-Ac-GD3 mAB Jones in live animals [100]. This block was also observed in GD3 synthase knockout mice [101]. Results from the latter study indicated that the inhibitory effect of mAB Jones may be caused by binding to \u03b21-integrin.",

It was proposed that anti-tumor cytotoxicity of NK cells was blocked, thereby alleviating undisturbed tumor growth. While at that time the mechanism of this possible inhibition was not clear, consecutive work may explain the mechanism. Nicoll et al. described that GD3 expressed on target cells is able to modulate NK cell cytotoxicity by interaction with Siglec-7 expressed on NK cells. Siglec-7 has a preference for binding of \u03b12,8 linked disialo glycans and seems to be one of the inhibitory NK cell receptors [117]. In the case of melanoma cells the inhibitory function of GD3 could not be verified since GD3 expressed on melanoma cells can induce another class of cytotoxic cells, the NKT cells [118]. It was further elucidated that the fine specificity of GD3 reactive NKT cells is mediated by binding to CD1d, a surface molecule structurally related to the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) which is expressed on T cells. CD1d has a preference for carbohydrate ligands. It is not clear at the moment whether in the in vivo situation there may be a balance between anti-melanoma NK and NKT cell-mediated immunity which affects the outcome of an effective immune surveillance in melanoma patients. Another mechanism to explain immune escape of melanoma cells may be that GD3 seems to be able to impair dendritic cell differentiation from monocytes and may induce their apoptosis [119]. On the other hand it is known that melanoma cells not only express GD3 but also its O-acetylated variants in various degrees [16]. One may speculate that O-acetylation of GD3 can provide another protective mechanism of melanoma cells against cytotoxic attack of immune cells.",

In an earlier report Sjoberg et al. stated that semisynthetic N-linked oligosaccharides with terminal O-acetylation have reduced binding to CD22 (Siglec2) and, further, treatment of murine lymphocytes with a chimeric influenza C esterase (CHE-Fc) clipping off O-acetyl residues increased binding of CD22 to various murine lymphocyte subsets [27]. CD22 is a B lymphocyte specific lectin which recognizes preferentially terminally \u03b12,6 sialylated lactosaminyl oligosaccharides. It does not react with \u03b12,3 sialylated structures. In the murine system CD22 has a preference for Neu5Gc whereas in humans CD22 solely recognizes Neu5Ac. Whether Neu5Gc is synthesized and expressed in the human system is most unlikely although some reports described its presence though in small quantities [122].",

Although these results prove a regulatory role of the sialate O-esterase towards B cell activation, the direct effect of 9-O-acetylation of CD22 ligands is still to be shown.

The same was observed in basalioma. In basalioma the expression of this antigen was generally up to 60-fold higher than in surrounding normal skin [17]. However, in breast carcinomas the situation seems to be more complex. In normal ducts and in benign lesions 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were present in Golgi regions and at the plasma membrane as detected by reaction with a CD60b antibody. This is in contrast to carcinomas of the breast where 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were distributed in the cytoplasm in a disorderly fashion [129]. Cell surface expression of CD60b structures was only observed in well-differentiated carcinomas and overall expression decreased with progression of malignancy. Similar changes in distribution of sialoglycans and the sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 responsible for \u03b12,6 sialylation have been found in hepatocellular carcinomas in which the disorder of sialoglycan distribution was correlated to the grade of malignancy [130]. It is still unclear whether loss of O-acetylation in malignant colon carcinomas is an advantage for tumor progression.",

            "text": "Surface-expressed 9-O- and 7-O-acetylated GD3 are abundantly expressed on human T lymphocytes [110]. Expression of both CD60b and CD60c (7-O-acetylated GD3) has also been detected on small resting lymphocytes of peripheral blood and on mature, activated T lymphocytes in lymph nodes [22, 112]. Tonsillar B lymphocytes, though to a smaller extent than T lymphocytes, express CD60b and c [22, 111]. Additionally the occurrence of CD60c was described on CD16+ NK cells, monocytes, and granulocytes to various extents [32] and on human CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow (Schwartz-Albiez, unpublished). Cell surface-expressed CD60b and c on T and B lymphocytes may have a functional role in the lymphocytic activation process because anti-CD60b and c monoclonal antibodies can influence lymphocytic proliferation [22, 32, 131]. An interesting observation was that T and B lymphocytes react towards stimulation with CD60b and c antibodies in a different way. While in T lymphocytes CD60c antibodies alone, like a mitogen, can stimulate proliferation in B cells, additional signals such as addition of the cytokine Il-4 and triggering of the B cell receptor (surface expressed immunoglobulin) are required. For stimulation with antibodies against CD60b in T and B lymphocytes, additional signals are required [22]. This differential behavior may have a basis in a different surface distribution of the antigens. While CD60b structures are found in dot-like formations, possibly as components of rafts, both in T and B cells, CD60c on T cells showed a more homogenous distribution on the cell surface [22]. It is most likely that CD60b is a cno-stimulatory signal for raft-concentrated receptors while CD60c in T cells acts as a mitogen. It is rather unlikely that gangliosides themselves confer transmembrane signaling because they do have neither a transmembrane nor an intracellular domain. An explanation may be that distinct glycosphingolipids cross-linked by antibodies can contribute to raft formation by pulling together a certain array of receptors.",

The removal of O-acetyl groups by sodium salicylate in lymphoblasts re-establishes the GD3-responsiveness to apoptotic signals.

Intracellular GD3 is involved in CD95- and ceramide-mediated apoptosis [133]. Upon receptor-triggering, de novo synthesized GD3 accumulates intracellularly which can be demonstrated by increased activity of GD3 synthase. GD3 as a rule is restricted to be present in the Golgi network and at the plasma membrane it is transferred to mitochondria via endosomal transport [134] to raft-like mitochondrial membrane domains [135]. The mechanisms of GD3-induced apoptosis can be traced back to a GD3-mediated change in the mitochondrial membrane potential and consequently increased production of reactive oxygen species [136, 137]. Oxidation of GD3 to GD3-7-aldehyde was shown to increase the apoptotic effect by targeting adenine nucleotide translocase [138]. O-Acetylation of GD3 suppresses this pro-apoptotic function of non-acetylated GD3 and does not have the deleterious effects of GD3 on mitochondria membranes [132]. Cells which are resistant to over-expression of GD3 convert existing GD3 more readily to 9-O-acetylated GD3 [132]. In further confirmation of the anti-apoptotic effects of O-acetylated GD3, Kniep et al. found that exogenous O-acetylated GD3 given to cells in vitro is internalized and can prevent apoptosis [139]. It was also observed that a T leukemia cell line resistant to apoptosis induced by N-acetyl-sphingosine or daunorubicin transferred GD3 more readily into 9-O-acetyl GD3 [139]. Targetting 9-O-acetylated GD3 with sialate-9-O-acetylesterase results in apoptosis of biopsy-derived human glioblastoma cells. Compared to treatment of cells with exogenous O-acetylesterase, the effect of de-O-acetylation is more pronounced when the esterase is expressed within the cells from a recombinant baculovirus vector [127]. Thus, these data strongly point to an anti-apoptototic function of intracellular 9-O-acetyl GD3 that may protect tumor cells from apoptosis. While data have been gathered on the anti-apoptotic effect of 9-O-acetyl GD3, no data are available on possible effects of 7-O-acetyl GD3. We have observed that in T and B cells 7-O-acetyl GD3 followed in its expression intensity by 9-O-acetyl GD3 is present in an intracellular pool [112]. Given that intracellular 9-O-acetyl GD3 confers anti-apoptotic capacity, can this protective effect possibly be accelerated by conversion of 7-O-acetyl- into 9-O-acetyl GD3?",

Attempts to isolate the enzyme by biochemical procedures [2, 166\u2013169] led to the identification of at least two different SOAT activities: partially purified SOAT from bovine submandibular glands transfers acetyl groups to C7 of Sias. It was proposed that migration of acetyl groups from C7 to C9 might be enzymatically catalyzed [2]. In a later publication the existence of a \u201cmigrase\u201d could not be substantiated [167]. A second type of SOAT was found in Golgi-enriched fractions of guinea pig liver, which transfers acetyl groups to C4 [170]. SOAT activity isolated from guinea pig liver preferred gangliosides as substrate. In addition, a heat-stable low molecular weight cofactor, which could be separated from SOAT activity by ultrafiltration, was proposed to enhance 4-O-SOAT activity [166]. In vitro several substrates, including free sialic acid, CMP-Sia, gangliosides, and glycoprotein-bound Sias could be acetylated by SOAT derived from different sources. In vivo free Sias most likely do not represent natural substrates for SOAT, because Sia is transferred into the Golgi as CMP-Sia by a nucleotide-sugar transporter [171, 172].",

Sialyltransferases were able to transfer Neu5,9Ac2 from the donor 9-O-Ac-CMP-Sia to glycoproteins, but at lower rates than Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc. It was concluded that a direct transfer of O-Ac-Sias to glycoproteins like bovine mucin from 9-O-Ac-CMP-Sia could account only for a fraction of the total O-Ac-Sias found. Moreover, it was proposed that 4-O-acetylation would result from the action of an O-acetyltransferase on the glycosidically-bound Sia [173]. Later it was found that both the CMP-Sia and acetyl-CoA transporters are critical components for the O-acetylation of CMP-Sia in the Golgi lumen. In addition, it was also suggested that a sialyltransferase exists that preferentially utilizes CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 as the donor substrate to sialylate Gal\u03b21,3(4)R- residues [164]. This finding was in contrast to earlier observations that acetyl-CoA does not enter isolated rat liver Golgi vesicles which are able to perform the acetylation of \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids on N-glycans [174]. Additional data had led to the proposal that O-acetylation is the product of a trans-membrane reaction, involving a membrane protein with essential histidine and lysine residues [175].

With such experiments, Ogura and coworkers reported the cloning of an O-acetyl ganglioside synthase with a significant homology to milk fat globule membrane protein [176]. Kanamori et al. isolated a trans-membrane protein that most likely represents an acetyl-CoA transporter. Interestingly, they found that expression of this transporter induced the formation of O-Ac-GD3 [177]. During the search for the SOAT gene Shi et al. also isolated cDNAs which most likely are not directly involved in transfer of O-acetyl groups: a cDNA clone encoding a chimeric protein composed of a bacterial tetracycline resistance gene repressor and a plasmid sequence was found to enhance O-acetylation. Also, a clone encoding a truncated form of vitamin D binding protein was isolated. In both cases, expression of the recombinant proteins was required to observe increased O-acetylation [178]. This finding may indicate that the expressed mRNAs or proteins are recognized by pattern recognition receptors that then induce an \u201calarm\u201d pathway, finally resulting in O-acetylation of sialic acids. Binding to the bacterial tetracycline resistance gene repressor may have triggered the initiation of cells to become pre-apoptotic by inducing the expression of 9-O-Ac-GD3. To speculate further, induction of apoptosis would then just require activation of the cellular SIAE to generate the pro-apoptotic ganglioside GD3. Another molecule possibly involved in O-acetylation of GD3 was identified as Tis21, a cell cycle regulator and cell death molecule [179]. It is possible that Tis21 may be a mediator of O-acetylation, but it appears unlikely that Tis21 represents the elusive SOAT. In GM2/GD2 knockout mice high amounts of 9-O-Ac-GD3 were found to accumulate in nerve tissue [180]. In this publication expression levels of the previously reported inducers of O-acetylation were also examined. No up-regulation was found for vitamin D binding protein, acetyl-CoA transporter, or the putative O-acetyl ganglioside synthase, while Tis21 was partially down regulated.",

A screening of the human genome database revealed the CASD1 gene as a candidate to encode a key enzyme involved in sialic acid O-acetylation [181]. When the Cas1 protein was expressed in COS cells together with ST8Sia1, a substantial increase of synthesis of 7-O-Ac-GD3 was observed. Human Cas1p was shown to co-localize with the Golgi marker ST6Gal1. At the mRNA level, elevated CASD1 expression was concomitant with increased levels of O-Ac-GD3 in primary human cells and in cell lines derived from human melanoma and liver cancers. Transfection of CASD1 specific siRNA resulted in a reduction of O-Ac-GD3 expression. On the other hand, expression of Cas1p in COS cells is not sufficient to direct O-acetylation of sialic acids on N- or O-linked glycans on the model glycoprotein erythropoietin (manuscript in preparation).",

This modification is present in high amounts in different plant polysaccharides. O-Acetylation is a hurdle in the processing of plant material into biofuels, because glycosidases used for degradation of plant polysaccharides are negatively affected by O-acetylation [183].

In Arabidopsis four RWA genes are present, and their expression in different plant tissues partially overlaps. The rwa2 mutant exhibited a 15\u201330% reduction in cell wall acetylation. Different polysaccharides were affected at similar rates. Therefore, it was speculated that rwa proteins act immediately upstream of the transfer of acetyl groups to different acceptors. Interestingly, the plant Cas1 proteins lack the N-terminal SGNH domain. Instead, a large number of proteins with similarity to the N-terminal domain of Cas1p was identified in a bioinformatics approach [186]. In plants, the DUF231 (domain of unknown function) family of proteins may be involved in the transfer of O-acetyl groups to specific acceptors, possibly by a trans-esterase mechanism [185]. In mammals, other proteins, including members of the FAM55 and FAM113 families, and C7orf58, exhibit similarities to the SGNH domain of Cas1p [186]. Thus, it may be speculated that these proteins are candidates to direct O-acetyl groups to sialic acids in different glycosidic linkages and/or to different carbons of sialic acids (Fig. 3).\n",

At least two forms of cellular 9-O-acetyl-SIAE, one in the cytoplasm and the other in the lysosomal compartment (i.e., membrane-bound), exist in mammals. The secreted form, originally termed luminal sialic acid esterase [191, 192], was later termed lysosomal sialic acid O-acetylesterase (Lse) [193], because it was shown by immuno-electron microscopy to co-localize with acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins [191]. This SIAE contains a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and is secreted from COS cells as a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa [193], whereas in rat liver it is found predominantly as a heterodimer composed of a small (28-kDa) and large (38-kDa) subunit connected by disulfide bridges. The small subunit could be labeled with the serine hydrolase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that SIAE is a serine esterase. No sequence similarities to other known serine esterases were found [192]. Amino acid residues, important for catalytic activity and secretion, were determined by expression of mutated cDNA. The mutations tested were found in the SIAE gene of patients with autoimmune disease [124]. Both subunits are encoded by the same mRNA in the order signal sequence \u2013 small subunit \u2013 large subunit. The precursor is presumably cleaved in lysosomal compartments [192, 194]. SIAE was identified independently by another research team as cDNA derived from a gene that is upregulated during B cell maturation. Several cDNAs were isolated which apparently are derived from differentially spliced SIAE mRNA [195]. One of the spliced mRNAs is lacking the exon for the signal sequence and encodes the cytosolic SIAE. While the mRNA for the secreted SIAE is widely expressed in different adult tissues, the expression of the cytosolic SIAE is restricted. Elevated expression of the latter was found mainly in liver, ovary, and brain [196]. SIAE regulates B cell antigen receptor signal strength and peripheral B cell development in mice [123], presumably by regulating recognition of \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids by CD22 [27], a negative regulator of the B cell receptor [197\u2013200] and Toll-like receptors [201]. Mutations in the SIAE gene resulting in a loss of function are strongly linked to autoimmune disease [124], while overexpression of SIAE is linked to pre-eclampsia [202], a condition of pregnant women who exhibit high blood pressure and proteinurea.",

While it can be envisaged that cytosolic SIAE is involved in de-O-acetylation of O-Ac-Sias delivered from lysosomes, the function of the \u201clysosomal\u201d SIAE remains controversial due to the unfavorable pH in lysosomes. The pH optimum of SIAE is in the neutral to alkaline range. Data indicate that intracellular vesicles exist which contain mannose-6-phosphate positive glycoproteins [191]. Such entities possibly represent transport vesicles on the way from the Golgi to lysosomes. In any case, precise models of how SIAE is involved in tuning the balance of O-acetylation of sialic acids are currently not available. Consequently, a large field is open for future investigations. Another question concerns the enzymatic activity of secreted SIAE, which was shown to be increased upon proteolytic cleavage [193]. The protease required for cleavage activation was proposed to be a lysosomal enzyme, but the nature of this protease remains to be determined. Moreover, it is apparently not a common protease. COS cells were shown to express and secrete the uncleaved SIAE [193].",

            "text": "Another puzzle remains concerning the distribution of the secreted SIAE. Available data indicate that it is intracellularly concentrated in lysosomal compartments [191]. On the other hand it is efficiently secreted into the culture supernatant of cells over-expressing SIAE, and therefore it has access to O-Ac-Sias at the cell surface [193, 195]. Furthermore, the substrate specificity was shown for O-acetyl groups on free sialic acids [193]. In Siae knockout mice, an increase in \u03b12,6-linked O-Ac-Sias was observed by using the influenza C virus lectin [123]. Strictly speaking, the influenza C virus lectin binds to any accessible O-Ac-Sia regardless of the underlying linkage. Thus, it remains an open question whether \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,8- linked sialic acids are also de-O-acetylated by SIAE. Furthermore, no SIAE hydrolyzing Neu4,5Ac2 has been purified to homogeneity allowing the determination of its relationship to SIAE specific for Neu5,9Ac2. In summary, the expression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins seems to be controlled by the relative activities of SOAT and SIAE. Many details on O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation still require clarification.",
