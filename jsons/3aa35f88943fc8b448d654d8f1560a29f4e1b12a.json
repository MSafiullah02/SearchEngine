A recent case-control study on acute respiratory infections in patients in general practices in The Netherlands showed that the incidence of rhinovirus among healthy control subjects was 11% [37]. These results show that rhinoviruses can be shed both by symptom-free immunocompromised patients and by healthy persons over a longer period of time, but also that interpretation of the value of PCR for the detection of rhinoviruses may be complicated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, the present study has shown that respiratory viruses are a major cause of respiratory tract disease in SCT recipients. We have demonstrated that real-time RT-PCR is much more sensitive than viral culture for detection of respiratory virus infection in SCT recipients, as well as in cases of LRTI. Rhinovirus caused the majority of URTIs, but one must be aware that rhinoviruses can also be detected occasionally in asymptomatic patients, suggesting that persistent shedding of respiratory viruses can occur in immunocompromised patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Community respiratory virus infections
