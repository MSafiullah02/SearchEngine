In addition, we have only been able to detect causative pathogens by RT-PCR in respiratory tract secretions since 2012, so our data only contained information about the patients\u2019 causative microorganisms for the past 4 years. Underlying diseases and the causative microorganisms could not be determined for all patients in the study group. Additionally, as our study was retrospective, we were not able to provide a control group to aid in the interpretation of the RT-PCR data. Another study limitation was that while we detected viruses (other than RSV) in nasopharynx samples, their presence does not necessarily imply a causal role in pneumonia, as these viruses can be detected at high frequencies in asymptomatic children. Similarly, detection of bacteria in the non-sterile nasopharynx environment does not imply causation of pneumonia, as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are frequent colonizers of the upper airway in asymptomatic children.",
