Since the 4 th of March [17] , control measures have been implemented within Saudi Arabia to try to control the spread of the disease. Isolation of confirmed cases and contact tracing are crucial part of these measures, which are common interventions for controlling infectious disease outbreaks [26] [27] [28] . For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), were controlled through tracing suspected cases and isolating confirmed cases because the majority of transmission occurred concurrent or after symptom onset [27] [28] [29] .",

The upper heat map of Figure 3 shows that practicing physical distancing could significantly reduce the value of R 0 and hence control the spread of the disease. The center panel of Figure 2 shows that about 18% of the entire Saudi population will be asymptomatic in the last week of May 2020 and about 17% will be exposed in the third week of May. The percentage of the entire population being symptomatic at anytime will not exceed 1%, which is estimated to occur in the third week of May. Moreover, about 60000 hospital beds and 18000 ICU beds are required (30% of the hospitalized cases [6] ) immediately after the second week of May.

I estimated a maximum value of \u03b2 1 to be 0.5 which is one half of the value reported by Li et al. [18] . This could be a reasonable estimation as we have not seen similar scenario in Saudi Arabia after 5 weeks since reaching 100 confirmed cases on the 14th of March (week 7 since the first case) as we have seen in many other countries like China, America and different European countries in the same timescale. This could be a result of the precautionary measures taken by the Saudi authorities, including closure of schools and universities that started as early as the 8 th of March (six days after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Saudi Arabia). Based on the above estimation for R 0 , the center panel of Figure 3 suggests that the infectious period for symptomatic patient could be in the range from 6.6 to 12.5 days (i.e., \u03a6 Y \u2208 [0.08, 0.15]) and the infectious period for asymptomatic patient could be in the range from 6.6 to 25 days (i.e., \u03a6 N \u2208 [0.04, 0.15]). The infectious period for symptomatic cases are consistent with what is being observed clinically [30] .",
