At each step, the virus must infect specific cell populations and produce progeny virus in order to continue the infection. Viruses can enter the body through ingestion, as in enterovirus infections, by the respiratory route, as in influenza or chicken pox, by inoculation across skin, as in arthropod-borne encephalitides or rabies, or across mucosal membranes, as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Virtually all viruses capable of infecting the CNS do so via hematogenous spread; exceptions are the rabies virus and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), all of which travel from the periphery to the CNS within peripheral nerves. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is transported within nerves during reactivated infection.",

Herpesviruses are taken into the cell following fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell.1 The human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV), the etiologic agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), reacts with serotonin and other receptors in this process.2 Alphaviruses, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus, recognize cell surface laminin and heparan molecules.3 Viral replication within the host cell may result in various outcomes including lytic infection with cell death; productive infection with budding of viruses across the cell membrane without death of the host cell; or persistent infection, with the virus remaining latent over time.2., 4. Classic examples of viruses causing latent infection include HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV, all of which persist in sensory ganglia and may reactivate to cause several syndromes including cutaneous lesions and CNS disease.4\n",

Antibody is required to control and clear enteroviruses, and failure of antibody response may result in progressive enteroviral encephalitis. In contrast, immune control of West Nile virus (WNV) involves both B and T cells.5., 6. Failure of host T-cell response is a major factor in the pathogenesis of PML, as is alteration in CNS T-cell immune surveillance following treatment with the immunomodulatory drug natalizumab in disorders such as multiple sclerosis.2., 7. CD8+ T cells are important in maintaining HSV and VZV in their latent states and in controlling both primary and reactivated infection.4 In general, the host immune response is protective, although the inflammatory process that results may augment cerebral edema; however, CNS or systemic infections may also elicit an immune response cross-reactive with antigens to the central or peripheral nervous system, leading to postinfectious neurologic injury.",

Enteroviruses survive well in water and sewage, are transmitted by fecal-oral or hand-mouth routes, and replicate initially in the gastrointestinal tract. Enteroviruses were previously subdivided into three groups: polioviruses, echoviruses, and coxsackieviruses. Newer isolated enteroviruses have been assigned numbers (e.g., enterovirus 71 or EV 71). Coxsackievirus A9 and echoviruses E7, E9, E11, E19, and E30 have accounted for 70 percent of all cultured isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cases of enteroviral meningitis. Polioviruses have been largely eradicated, persisting only in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Other enteroviruses have a worldwide distribution, and although cases of enteroviral meningitis occur throughout the year, infection is most likely to occur during summer and early fall months when conditions of sanitation are most lax. Acute enterovirus infection is usually asymptomatic or may result in mild gastroenteritis or pharyngitis; less than 5 percent of patients will develop meningitis or encephalitis.19\n",

The symptoms of meningitis are usually not severe and resolve in most but not all cases; in some patients, HIV meningitis becomes chronic.40 The CSF typically reveals a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein content, and normal glucose level.40 Standard serologic tests for HIV (as well as tests for home use) are negative in many patients with this acute syndrome; serologic tests first become positive 22 to 27 days after onset of acute infection.41 The diagnosis of acute HIV meningitis is made by detecting viral RNA or viral p24 antigen in serum or plasma; the viral RNA usually becomes detectable 3 to 5 days prior to the detection of p24 antigen and is typically present in copy numbers greater than 50,000 copies/ml.41 Treatment of HIV is with antiretroviral therapy, and follow-up assay for antiviral antibodies is used to confirm the diagnosis.

Although viral meningitis typically produces a lymphocytic pleocytosis, polymorphonuclear leukocytes may constitute over 50 percent of the cells during the first 24 to 36 hours of the infection and may occasionally remain the predominant cell type for longer periods of time.33 Protein is usually elevated in the range of 50 to 100 mg/dl but is sometimes higher.33 The CSF glucose level in viral meningitis is usually greater than 50 percent of blood glucose; the absence of CSF hypoglychorrhachia is an important consideration in differentiating viral from bacterial meningitis. Depression of glucose to levels approaching those of bacterial meningitis may occasionally occur in meningitis caused by HSV-2, VZV, mumps, and LCMV.33 In the proper setting, lymphocytic pleocytosis with low CSF glucose may also raise concern about tuberculous or fungal meningitis.",

Because asymptomatic enterovirus infections are common in the summer months, enterovirus isolation from throat or stool does not make a definitive diagnosis of enterovirus meningitis. In one study, use of an enterovirus PCR assay in the emergency department in children with aseptic meningitis resulted in significantly less antibiotic use, shorter length of hospitalization, and lower hospital costs.42 Although it is the diagnostic study of choice in many viral meningitides, CSF PCR may be negative early in the disease course, and diagnostic yield may be highest when CSF is obtained within 3 to 14 days of onset of meningitis.43 In certain instances, the detection of CSF immunoglobulins may have greater diagnostic sensitivity than PCR. This is the case in WNV neuroinvasive disease and other arbovirus infections, in which detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) is more sensitive than PCR.33 Similarly, detection of virus-specific IgG in CSF may prove diagnostic in infections due to protracted or reactivated VZV where PCR is negative.44 Identification of the causative agent in viral meningitis may be made retrospectively by detecting a rise in IgG antibody titers between acute and convalescent (obtained after 3 to 6 weeks) serum or, at times, by detecting an abnormal serum:CSF ratio of antiviral antibodies.",

The possibility of infection by one of these agents should be kept in mind in a patient with suspected viral meningitis, since all are amenable to antibiotic treatment. In particular, Borrelia burgdorferi can be a major cause of lymphocytic meningitis in endemic areas (see Chapter 40).45., 46. Aseptic meningitis may also be associated with a variety of pharmacologic agents including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, augmentin, carbamazepine, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and the murine monoclonal antibody OKT3.47., 48.\n",

Neuropathologic correlates of cutaneous zoster include focal meningeal inflammation, necrosis of associated neurons, and degeneration of motor and sensory nerve roots in the involved area.83 Cutaneous zoster may develop without known precipitating cause or may be triggered by systemic cancer, spinal irradiation, HIV infection or other immunosuppressed states, or spinal trauma.83 Many patients experience a sharp, burning discomfort in a dermatomal distribution for 2 to 5 days before onset of the rash. A localized redness with red macules then develops and progresses to vesicles in the same dermatomal pattern as the pain.83 Additional vesicles may appear over the next 2 to 7 days. The distribution of herpes zoster is usually unilateral and involves a single dermatome. The rash involves the trunk in 50 percent, the head in 20 percent, the arms in 15 percent, and the legs in 15 percent of cases. Over the next month, the dermatomal pain slowly disappears, leaving residual hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia. Occasional patients may present with dermatomal pain without rash, termed zoster sine herpete.83 Treatment with oral valacyclovir (1 gram three times daily for 7 to 10 days) shortens the duration of rash and acute pain.83., 84.

Postherpetic itch is also common. The live attenuated Oka strain VZV vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of cutaneous zoster in healthy individuals by 50 percent and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by 67 percent.86 To what extent antiviral treatment of acute zoster lessens the likelihood of PHN has not been clearly demonstrated.84 Symptomatic treatment of PHN is often disappointing. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, controlled-release morphine sulfate, oxycodone, and lidocaine patches have moderate to high efficacy, but are sometimes completely unhelpful.87 Aspirin in cream or ointment form, topical capsaicin, and intrathecal methylprednisolone are less effective, limited by side effects, or both.87 For most of these medications, treatment involves escalating dosages of medication until pain relief is achieved or unacceptable side effects occur.",

It is now realized, however, that CNS involvement by VZV is much more frequent; in one series VZV was found to be the most common agent identified in viral meningitis and encephalitis (29% of isolates).88 Studies from France and England have identified the agent in 5 to 15 percent of encephalitis isolates.89., 90. The virus is now known to cause a wide range of syndromes of neurologic injury involving not only brain and spinal cord but also cranial nerves and brainstem or peripheral ganglia.88 CNS invasion in reactivated VZV infection occurs following spread of virus from trigeminal or spinal sensory ganglia; in this process, the virus may produce ophthalmic involvement or may produce Ramsay\u2013Hunt syndrome, in which infection of the tympanic membrane and surrounding structures is accompanied by facial nerve palsy.88 Of greater concern and unlike HSV, VZV may infect both large and small vessels supplying the brain or spinal cord, at times followed by spread of the infection into neural parenchyma.88., 91. Involvement of vessels may produce focal or multifocal ischemic injury or may cause vessel-wall necrosis with resulting arterial dissection, aneurysm formation, or hemorrhage within the subarachnoid space or brain parenchyma.88 The classic presentation of VZV vasculopathy is herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in which there is initial superficial zoster in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve followed days to weeks later by stroke in the territory of the carotid or middle cerebral artery.88 However, VZV vasculitis may occur with or without preceding cutaneous zoster or herpes zoster ophthalmicus or oticus and may involve virtually any vascular territory within the brain or spinal cord. VZV vasculitis may be significantly more severe in HIV infection or other immunosuppressed states, and immunosuppressed patients may develop a more slowly progressive CNS vasculopathy or myelitis.88\n",

The virus then spreads outward within nerves (the centrifugal phase of infection) to involve multiple tissues including salivary glands, corneas, and the heart.

The association of EBV with specific disease presentations, however, is made difficult by two properties of the virus. First, EBV infects and can remain latent in B lymphocytes for many years. For this reason, PCR amplification of EBV DNA from CSF in patients with suspected CNS infection may simply indicate the presence of the virus in lymphocytes rather than proving it as a causative agent. Second, like HSV, EBV can reactivate under situations of physiologic stress, so that a rise in antibody titer in the setting of acute illness may or may not be indicative of disease causation.",

Its causative agent, the human polyomavirus JCV, affects over 50 percent of individuals worldwide by late adult life.2 Acute viral infection is not known to cause symptomatic illness, but the virus establishes protracted infection of renal tubular epithelial cells and other tissues, possibly including the brain.2., 143. In PML, JCV produces lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, causing areas of demyelination; astrocytes are also infected in some cases.2 PML was initially described as a rare disorder of patients with hematologic malignancies and in immunosuppressed patients. In untreated AIDS, however, 4 percent of patients will die of PML, which can be the presenting feature.144 In recent years, PML has become increasingly frequent in patients treated with the more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens now used for collagen-vascular diseases and solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.145 PML has also become a significant\u2014although infrequent\u2014complication of treatment with natalizumab and other monoclonal immunosuppressive agents such as rituximab, efalizumab, alemtuzumab, and TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.146 The course of PML is that of the progressive development of multifocal neurologic deficits that may involve motor control, sensation, speech, vision, or cognition. Occasional patients develop cerebellar or brainstem signs, but clinical involvement of the spinal cord is virtually never present. Rarely AIDS patients have been reported to develop JCV infection of cerebellar granule or other neurons.147\n",

Signs indicating temporal lobe involvement suggest herpes simplex encephalitis, but other viral encephalitides may have a similar presentation as may occasional bacterial infections or autoimmune encephalitis from antineuronal antibodies. Patients often have an elevated peripheral white blood cell count, but signs of systemic infection may also be absent. Diagnosis relies heavily on clinical findings, MRI, and the results of CSF analysis. MRI in herpes simplex encephalitis characteristically shows abnormalities of one or both temporal lobes, at times with involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, or cingulate gyrus. Similar findings, however, may be seen in other potentially treatable conditions including neurosyphilis and autoimmune encephalitis.155., 156. The CSF in viral encephalitis typically shows significant pleocytosis and an elevated protein but normal glucose concentration. The pleocytosis is commonly lymphocytic, but is neutrophilic in rare cases.33 A depressed CSF glucose level, while not typical, has been described in VZV, LCMV, mumps, and HSV-2 infections.33 CSF should be sent for PCR for HSV, and consideration should be given to ordering PCR for other agents. Detection of virus-specific IgM in CSF is more sensitive than PCR for the diagnosis of WNV and may be useful in other arboviral infections where PCR is negative. Similarly, elevated CSF titers of IgG may be more sensitive than PCR in encephalitis due to reactivated VZV. Lumbar puncture may need to be deferred when there is evidence on examination, CT, or MRI of increased intracranial pressure or mass lesion.",

Decompressive craniectomy has resulted in patient survival with good initial outcome in a few cases of herpes simplex encephalitis complicated by fulminant cerebral edema.157 Cerebral salt wasting or SIADH may require treatment with hydration and sodium supplementation, or fluid restriction, respectively.

Prion diseases of animals include scrapie of sheep (the prototype for this group of conditions), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, wasting disease of deer and elk, and transmissible mink encephalopathy.159 Prion diseases are not caused by viruses but rather by a self-replicating isoform of a normal intracellular sialoglycoprotein. The normal cellular protein is termed \u201cPrP(c)\u201d and the self-replicating protein causing disease is referred to as \u201cPrP(Sc).\u201d PrP(Sc) does not contain nucleic acid, its presence does not elicit an immune response, and it is not inactivated by many agents normally used for decontamination.159., 160. Interaction of PrP(Sc) with PrP(c) appears to be essential for disease.159., 160. Except in familial cases, PrP(Sc) is thought to arise from a spontaneous mutation in PrP(c). Several different subtypes of CJD have been associated with homozygosity or heterozygosity of methionine or valine at codon 129 of the PrP gene, differences in variation in glycosylation patterns of PrP(Sc), and patterns of electrophoretic mobility of PrP(Sc) after proteinase K digestion.159., 160. Prion diseases have repeatedly been shown to be transmissible through PrP(Sc)-contaminated material, including PrP(Sc)-containing human grafts of dura mater or other tissues, contaminated electrodes used for intracerebral recording, and human pituitary-derived growth hormone. In the case of vCJD, transmission has occurred predominantly through ingestion of contaminated beef, but it has also occurred through blood transfusion.159., 161.\n",

The onset of CJD is typically with subtle changes in cognition and personality changes that may include apathy, irritability, depression, or paranoia.159 Occasional patients present with ataxia, spasticity, or visual complaints. These initial symptoms are followed by progressive dementia, often involving parietal lobe symptoms and, at times, aphasia. As the disease progresses, over 85 percent of patients develop stimulus-sensitive myoclonic jerks that tend to disappear as the disease progresses to profound dementia and a vegetative state. CJD is untreatable, and its course is relentlessly progressive, resulting in death within 6 months to 2 years.159\n",

The EEG initially may show only mild slowing but subsequently becomes strikingly abnormal, with repetitive, periodic, stereotyped, bilaterally synchronous sharp waves that usually occur at a frequency of 1 to 2 per second and are often associated with myoclonic jerks.163., 164. This periodic EEG activity may give way to generalized slowing late in the disease.163., 164. MRI has become the major diagnostic test in suspected CJD and typically shows foci of increased signal in the putamen, caudate, thalamus, and gray matter of the cerebral cortex. These findings are most prominent on diffusion-weighted sequences and, with less sensitivity, FLAIR sequences (Fig. 43-6\n); MRI changes are not reliably present in familial CJD.165 Detection of 14-3-3 and tau proteins as well as neuron-specific enolase in CSF provides supportive evidence for the presence of CJD in patients with clinical, EEG, or MRI markers of the disease.166 None of these CSF markers is specific for CJD, however, and their use in unselected patients may lead to erroneous diagnosis.166 Postmortem diagnosis can be made by the characteristic brain histopathology and staining with specific prion antibodies or by demonstration of prions from homogenized brain using immunodiagnostic procedures.",

These prodromal symptoms are followed by the abrupt\u2014at times fulminant\u2014onset of CNS dysfunction. Altered mental state is almost universal and may range from drowsiness to frank coma. Meningeal signs are common. Neurologic examination may reveal unilateral or bilateral corticospinal tract signs, hemiplegia, ataxia, aphasia, sensory loss, visual field defects, or cranial nerve palsies. Focal or generalized seizures occur in up to 70 percent of children under 5 years of age, 80 percent of whom may develop status epilepticus.171 Occasionally, postinfectious encephalomyelitis may be accompanied by optic neuritis or by involvement of the peripheral nervous system. The simultaneous occurrence of central and peripheral demyelinating events appears to be more common in adults than children.172 A syndrome of ataxia may be seen in patients following chicken pox or, less frequently, other viral infections.173\n",

In the majority of cases, the condition involves the thoracic level of the spinal cord. Onset of symptoms is often abrupt, with rapid progression to maximal deficit; in some patients, however, progression occurs over 1 to 2 weeks. Symptoms typically include fever, back and leg pain, muscle weakness, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction. Neurologic examination may demonstrate corticospinal tract signs and level-specific sensory loss. The patient may initially exhibit flaccid weakness that progresses over weeks to spasticity. CSF usually shows a lymphocytic or polymorphonuclear pleocytosis with protein levels that may be as high as 500 mg/dl. MRI of the spinal cord often demonstrates focal areas of increased T2 signal. Acute transverse myelitis may represent the first episode of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica.179 MRI may have diagnostic value in differentiating these entities from postviral transverse myelitis: partial transverse lesions are more likely to indicate multiple sclerosis, whereas longitudinal involvement of multiple segments is associated with neuromyelitis optica.180\n",

The major initial step in patients with suspected postinfectious encephalomyelitis is to exclude multifocal CNS infection or, less likely, vasculitis. In patients with transverse myelitis, extrinsic spinal cord compression requiring surgery must be excluded. Lumbar puncture is of diagnostic value in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In contrast, the most valuable diagnostic test in postinfectious encephalomyelitis or transverse myelitis is contrast-enhanced MRI. In Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the efficacy of plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin G has been demonstrated in controlled trials, as discussed in Chapter 59. In contrast, the treatment of ADEM is typically based on case reports and observational studies; some evidence exists for the use of methylprednisolone, usually given at a dose of 1 gram daily for 5 days.154., 172., 173., 174., 181. Plasma exchange (usually five exchanges in total, performed daily or every other day) and intravenous immunoglobulin G, given as a total dose of 2 g/kg over 3 to 5 days, have also been used, either in combination with methylprednisolone or after methylprednisolone failure.174 A variety of other immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide have been used in individual cases. Initial treatment of acute transverse myelitis typically involves high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone.181 Although treatment of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis is frequently unsuccessful, occasional patients have survived after early treatment with combinations of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin G, plasma exchange, or cyclophosphamide.172\n",
