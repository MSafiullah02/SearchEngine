Combating zoonotic diseases is not how to clean up the disease mess after the fact, but on how to prevent the mess from occurring in the first place. It would almost appear that the ideological lenses through which diseases in general are being studied preclude acting on the evidence.

If the pathogen is also transmissible in the new host species, then a new transmission cycle may be established.
