Moreover, the causative agents of respiratory viral infections are numerous, and simultaneous infection by more than one virus is present in 5 to 15% of infections 7, 8, 9. Thus, molecular methods that are capable of multiplex detection are beneficial for rapid detection. Various multiplex nucleic acid amplification\u2010 and microarray\u2010based methods have been evaluated for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respiratory viruses 8, 10, 11. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) assay (Luminex Corporation, Toronto, Canada) is a suspension microarray that incorporates bead hybridization after multiplex reverse\u2010transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR) and target\u2010specific primer extension. The Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus (RV+) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) detects the nucleic acids of respiratory viruses with gold nanoparticle based probes on a solid microarray after multiplex RT\u2010PCR. These assays have different targets and principles of detection for viral pathogens. There have been very few studies using the Verigene RV+ assay 12, 13, a solid microarray for respiratory virus testing and thus, we conducted a study to compare the performance of the Verigene RV+ assay and xTAG RVP assay, a liquid bead array for the detection of common targets of the assays, influenza virus A (INF A), influenza virus B (INF B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in respiratory specimens of hospitalized patients.",

In brief, RT\u2010PCR was performed with 5 \u03bcl of the extracted nucleic acid on a PTC\u2010200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Target\u2010specific primer extension was performed with 5 \u03bcl of RT\u2010PCR product mixed with 15 \u03bcl of master mix. Twenty microliters of RVP bead mix was aliquoted into each well of the plate and 3.5 \u03bcl of the product was added to the corresponding wells. The beads and the PCR products were incubated and the reporter solution was added. A Luminex 200 (Luminex Corporation) was used to detect the mean fluorescence intensity of the products. Positive and negative controls were included and the results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's recommendation by the mean fluorescence intensity.",
