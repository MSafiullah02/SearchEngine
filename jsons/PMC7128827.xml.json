            "text": "The majority of deaths in thermally injured patients are associated with infection rather than the physical damage to the skin or the resulting abnormal metabolism [1], [2], [3], [4]. As compared with healthy individuals, thermally injured patients have an increased susceptibility to infection because of burn-associated defects in their antibacterial responses [5]. Macrophages (M\u03d5) are one of the critical effector cells in antibacterial innate immune responses [6]. After certain stimulations, resident M\u03d5 (R-M\u03d5, M\u03d5 isolated from healthy individuals) convert into two different populations: classically activated M\u03d5 (M1M\u03d5) and alternatively activated M\u03d5 (M2M\u03d5) [7], [8]. M1M\u03d5 exhibit the ability to (i) kill infected cells, (ii) express inducible nitric oxide synthase, and (iii) secrete nitric oxide, pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th1 response-associated cytokines [8]. In contrast, M2M\u03d5 are commonly found in patients with severe infections, malignancies, thermal injuries, or after major surgery [7], [9], [10]. In a mouse model of thermal injury, M2M\u03d5 have been demonstrated 3\u20135 days after thermal injury [11], [12]. These M\u03d5 preferentially express receptors for foreign antigens (mannose receptor, \u03b2-glucan receptors and scavenger receptors) and produce interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10, CCL17, CCL22 and arginase [7], [9], [10]. In addition, IL-10 and CCL17 released from M2M\u03d5 inhibit M2M\u03d5 generation [13]. Therefore, M1M\u03d5 do not appear in hosts whose M2M\u03d5 predominate [13].",

These PMNs are distinguished from each other in the following ways: PMN-I (Gr-1+CD11b\u2212CD49d+) produce IL-12/CCL3 and express Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/TLR4/TLR5/TLR8; PMN-II (Gr-1+CD11b+CD49d\u2212) produce IL-10/CCL2 and express TLR2/TLR4/TLR7/TLR9; normal PMN (PMN-N, Gr-1+CD11b\u2212CD49d\u2212), lacking the ability to produce these cytokines, express TLR2/TLR4/TLR9 [14]. PMN-II isolated from MRSA-susceptible mice functioned to generate M2M\u03d5 from R-M\u03d5, while PMN-I isolated from MRSA-resistant mice stimulated R-M\u03d5 conversion to M1M\u03d5. PMN-N did not show any activities on the modification of M\u03d5. CCL2 and IL-10 released from PMN-II were shown as effector molecules for M2M\u03d5 generation [14].",

In Japan, GL has been used clinically for more than 20 years in patients with chronic hepatitis [16], [17], [18], [19]. The antiviral activities of GL against human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 2, influenza virus, and coronavirus that related to severe acute respiratory syndrome have been reported [20], [21], [22], [23].

This procedure produced a third-degree burn, on approximately 15% of the total body surface area for a 26 g mouse. Immediately after thermal injury, physiologic saline (2 ml/mouse, i.p.) was administered for fluid resuscitation. Animals were then housed until used for experiments.

As previously described [14], PMN were isolated from the whole peripheral blood of normal and thermally injured mice, using Ficoll-Hypaque and dextran sedimentations. PMN isolated from normal mice were designated as PMN-N, and PMN derived from mice 18 h after burn injury were utilized as PMN-II, as previously described [14]. Briefly, peripheral blood was withdrawn from the heart of each mouse with a heparinized syringe. The peripheral blood was centrifuged with Ficoll-Hypaque, and precipitates were obtained as a PMN rich fraction. The precipitates were suspended in 1% dextran (T-500, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and kept for 1 h at room temperature to allow for the sedimentation of residual erythrocytes. The PMN fraction was further treated with erythrocyte-lysing kits (R&D Systems) to eliminate the remaining erythrocytes. The purity of PMN from the final preparation was routinely more than 93%, when analyzed by flow cytometry with FITC-conjugated anti-Gr-1 mAb and Wright\u2013Giemsa/alkaline phosphatase stainings.

Eighteen hours after cultivation, the upper chamber was removed and cells in the lower chamber were recultured for 6\u201330 h. Culture fluids harvested were assayed for CCL17, a typical parameter of M2M\u03d5. Twelve hours after cultivation, CCL17 production by these M\u03d5 was first demonstrated, and it peaked 24 h after cultivation. However, the chemokine was not produced by M\u03d5 cultured with PMN-II in transwells supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml of GL (\nFig. 1A). M\u03d5 harvested from control cultures (R-M\u03d5 only cultured with or without PMN-N) did not produce CCL17 into their culture fluids. As shown in Fig. 1B, R-M\u03d5 converted to M2M\u03d5 in association with the number of PMN-II added to the upper chamber of the transwells, because the total amounts of CCL17 produced by R-M\u03d5 were increased after transwell cultures in response to the numbers of PMN-II added to the cultures. However, the production of CCL17 from M\u03d5 stimulated with PMN-II was markedly inhibited (95%) when transwell cultures of 6 \u00d7 105 cells/well of R-M\u03d5 and 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well of PMN-II were performed in the presence of GL (Fig. 1B). When various doses of GL were added to the transwell cultures, a 10 \u03bcg/ml dose was shown to be 50% inhibitory on the production of CCL17. The maximum inhibition of CCL17 production was shown when transwell cultures were performed with 100 \u03bcg/ml of GL (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that GL inhibits M2M\u03d5 generation from R-M\u03d5 that were stimulated with PMN-II.",

Therefore, the inhibitory effect of GL on the production of CCL2 and IL-10 by PMN-II was examined. In the presence of a 100 \u03bcg/ml dose of GL, PMN-II were examined for their abilities to produce CCL2 and IL-10. This experiment was performed with a PMN-II preparation obtained from mice 18 h after thermal injury, based on the time course of the appearance of PMN-II in thermally injured mice [14]. PMN-II produced CCL2 into their culture fluids 6\u201318 h after cultivation. However, CCL2 production was significantly inhibited 12\u201318 h after GL treatment. Similarly, PMN-II produced IL-10 into their culture fluids 6\u201318 h after cultivation, while PMN-II treated with GL did not produce IL-10 into their culture fluids (\nFig. 4).

M2M\u03d5 were generated from R-M\u03d5 after cultivation with PMN-II in dual-chamber transwells. However, M2M\u03d5 were not generated from R-M\u03d5 cultured with PMN-II in transwell cultures supplemented with GL. In our previous study, CCL2 and IL-10 released from PMN-II were shown as effector molecules for M2M\u03d5 generation, because a mixture of mAbs directed against CCL2 and IL-10 completely inhibited the generation of M2M\u03d5 from R-M\u03d5 stimulated with the PMN-II culture fluid [14]. In addition, M2M\u03d5 generation from R-M\u03d5 was demonstrated after treatment with a mixture of rCCL2 and rIL-10. When GL at a dose of 100 \u03bcg/ml was added to these cultures, M2M\u03d5 generation from R-M\u03d5 was not influenced. This suggests that GL does not prevent M\u03d5 conversion from R-M\u03d5 to M2M\u03d5 directly stimulated with CCL2 and IL-10. In contrast, GL showed an ability to inhibit the production of IL-10 and CCL2 from PMN-II. These results suggest that GL inhibits PMN-II-associated M\u03d5 conversion from R-M\u03d5 to M2M\u03d5 through the inhibition of CCL2 and IL-10 production by PMN-II. According to our recent studies [13], [14], in this experiment, peritoneal M\u03d5 were used. Because the repression mechanism of M2 skewing in bone marrow-derived M\u03d5 was shown to be different from that of tissue-derived M\u03d5 [28], further studies will be needed to clarify the effect of GL on PMN-II-stimulated M2M\u03d5 generation from various M\u03d5 populations. As reported in many papers [29], [30], [31], the non-cytotoxic properties of GL have been shown. Cytotoxicities of GL (1\u2013200 \u03bcg/ml) against various murine and human cells were not demonstrated when the assay was performed by (i) trypan blue dye-exclusion test, (ii) the proliferative responses of cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb or Con A, (iii) H-2 class II antigen expression, and (iv) interferon production. These results strongly suggest that GL at concentrations of 1\u2013100 \u03bcg/ml is not cytotoxic to M\u03d5 and PMN-II.",

            "text": "Recently, we have reported that mice with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are susceptible to Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA and infectious complications induced by cecal ligation and puncture [32]. M2M\u03d5 generated in association with SIRS manifestations have been determined as effector cells on the increased susceptibility of SIRS mice to various infections. Also, CCL2, a product of the SIRS development, was determined as an effector factor on M2M\u03d5 generation. On the other hand, the ability of Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 and/or IL-13) to induce M2M\u03d5 has been well documented [7], [8], [33]. In this paper, GL was shown to be an inhibitor of CCL2 and IL-10 production by PMN-II. The in vitro effect of GL on inhibiting CCL2 production has been reported in cultures of human peripheral blood monocytes infected with HIV or treated with an inducer of M2M\u03d5 generation (1-methyladenosine) [15], murine peritoneal M\u03d5 from SIRS mice [34] and R-M\u03d5 treated with norepinephrine [35]. Recently, several studies have indicated that the enhancer region of the CCL2 gene is inhibited by glucocorticoids, progesterone and estrogen in cells stimulated with LPS, IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1, after binding to their receptors [36], [37]. 18\u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a final metabolite of GL in a living body, is similar to deoxycorticosterone and this metabolite binds to glucocorticoid receptors [38]. In fact, this metabolite has been shown to inhibit CCL2 production by peritoneal M\u03d5 stimulated with IL-1. GL may suppress CCL2 production through the inhibition of CCL2 gene activation after binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Further studies are required to clarify the molecular mechanism by which GL inhibits CCL2 and IL-10 production.",

PMN with properties similar to PMN-II have recently been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of mice with severe pancreatitis, progressive tumors and severe infections. These mice have also been recognized as hosts with M2M\u03d5. In normal individuals, M1M\u03d5 are generated in response to bacterial products or cytokines released in the early stages of host innate responses against bacterial invasion, and contribute to eradicate early bacterial growth [7], [8]. Because M2M\u03d5 suppress the generation of M1M\u03d5 [13], M1M\u03d5 generation will be minimal even if hosts with a predominance of M2M\u03d5 generation are exposed to pathogens. For this reason, carriers of M2M\u03d5 would be susceptible to various infections. Utilizing the in vitro assay system, here we showed that GL inhibits M2M\u03d5 generation stimulated with PMN-II. The regulation of PMN-II-associated M2M\u03d5 generation by GL may provide a new therapeutic strategy, which could influence the outcome of certain severe infections in hosts with M2M\u03d5 generation.",
