WHO maintains a restricted-access website (event information system) to inform States about unusual events reported through the IHR and to convey WHO\u2019s assessment of their severity. The IHR also mandate WHO to perform public health surveillance, support States in their development of relevant capacities, and co-ordinate response activities to events that constitute an international public health risk. In extraordinary circumstances, the Director-General of WHO can determine that a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019 is occurring.

In April 2009, the US Government notified WHO through the IHR system about a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus that had been identified in specimens obtained in late March from two epidemiologically unlinked children living in southern California who had developed an acute febrile respiratory illness.13, 15 On 23 April 2009, the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada determined that the influenza virus isolated from patients in Mexico was identical to the influenza A (H1N1) viruses from the two Californian patients.13 The Mexican Ministry of Health immediately reported these findings to WHO. WHO, in turn, shared this critical information globally with IHR NFPs through the IHR information mechanism (i.e. event information system). Two days later, the WHO Director-General, after having convened the Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005), declared that the events constituted a public health emergency of international concern.

Disease had already been reported from three different locations in Mexico. Given the widespread presence of the virus, and on the advice of the IHR Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General considered that rapid containment planned in Phase 416, 17 to halt transmission of the virus at its source was not possible. Sustained human-to-human transmission was soon documented in at least two countries (the USA and Mexico) in the same region, prompting WHO to raise the alert level to Phase 5 on 29 April 2009. WHO did not advise border closures or restrictions on international travel.13 The first outbreak investigations found that a significant proportion of cases had no or minimal symptoms, reducing the likelihood that screening at border crossings would be effective. For the next several weeks, spread of the virus globally was documented through reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths through IHR focal points in each newly affected country. Daily updates on the situation were issued on the WHO website during the first weeks of the pandemic. There was a continued need to detect and report the virus as it appeared in each subsequent country, to inform decisions about pandemic phases and to alert countries that had not yet been affected.",

Severity-related parameters that were useful early in the pandemic included the proportion of cases that required hospitalization for treatment or required intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and the proportion of severe cases that occurred in previously healthy individuals without underlying risk factors. The impact on the healthcare system was reflected in hospital occupancy rates, the proportion of intensive care beds occupied by influenza cases, and the busyness of emergency rooms and outpatient treatment centres. However, few of these indicators of impact had historical data to place them in context, and the interpretation of the data depended somewhat on anecdotal reports. Most of this information was not available through routine information systems but was obtained through ad-hoc data collection.",

Thus, while general patterns can be observed, it is impossible to aggregate or directly compare data from countries using different groupings. Similarly, countries collected information on different risk factors for severe disease and death and used varied definitions for factors such as obesity and chronic cardiovascular disease. Even the reporting of fatal cases was complicated by the use of different definitions for \u2018influenza-associated\u2019 death. Consequently, at a global level, there was considerable imprecision in reporting such key parameters as the proportion of previously healthy young adults with influenza-related severe respiratory disease (e.g. range of 20\u201350%).

However, case counts were never accurate, even from the beginning of the pandemic, due to limitations in detecting and testing all persons with an influenza-like illness, nor would it have been a good use of resources to attempt to do so. Further, such efforts do not take into account the potentially large number of persons who were asymptomatic or experienced a mild, non-specific illness. Different surveillance approaches and testing policies by different countries resulted in wide disparities in the reported numbers of both mild and severe cases of pandemic influenza between countries. Such technical constraints are challenging concepts to convey to the media and the public, especially in the setting of uncertainty associated with an emerging public health threat.

The virological information about the pandemic virus collected through the GISN, for example, was easier to collect than the epidemiological information for which WHO had no pre-established system or standards in place. Clinical information was collected through an ad-hoc mechanism at the global level and sometimes at the country level as well; such an approach was time and resource consuming.
