Unfortunately, these viruses are often difficult to control due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines. In addition to SARS-CoV2, two other novel coronaviruses have emerged as global health threats since 2002, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV in 2002) that was transmitted to 37 countries, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV in 2012) that was transmitted to 27 countries. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV) are often associated with induced hypercytokinemia, also termed cytokine storm, in immunocompetent individuals; uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines contributes to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

IL-6, which is an important target in CRS induced by adoptive cell therapy, can lead to vascular leakage, activation of complement and the coagulation cascade, leading to the characteristic symptoms of severe CRS, such as diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) [5,6]. It is noteworthy that IL-6 is likely to cause cardiomyopathy by promoting myocardial dysfunction, which is often observed in patients with CRS [7]. In addition, activation of endothelial cells may also be one of the hallmarks of severe CRS. Endothelial dysfunction can lead to capillary leakage, hypotension, and coagulopathy [8] (Fig. 1\n). Taken together, these studies argue that the virus-induced immunopathological events play a crucial role in the fatal pneumonia observed after HCoV infections [9].",

In viral infections, the aberrant release of pro-inflammatory factors leads to lung epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis which damages the lung microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barrier, leading to vascular leakage, alveolar edema and hypoxia. The uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory factors, containing IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, and GM-CSF, and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL-5, IP-10, and CCL3, together with reactive oxygen species cause ARDS leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death [12].",

In MERS infection, high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL- 10, and CCL5) were likewise observed in severe disease, compared to mild or moderate disease [14]. In contrast to SARS and MERS, doctors in Wuhan Central South Hospital found that the levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a and TNF \u03b1 were significantly elevated in the blood of severely ill patients, compared to patients with mild illness [2]. The level of IL-6 in the blood of the severe group was 76 % higher than that of the mild group (30 %) [15]. Furthermore, histological examination and biopsy samples obtained from a patient who died from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR4+CCR6+ Th17+ CD4 T cells, suggesting that T cell hyperactivation contributesdin part to the severe immune injury in this patient [16]. Pulmonary examination in other patients with early phase SARS-COV-2 pneumonia also revealed patchy inflammatory cell infiltration; however, the pathological results in early stage of SARS-COV2 pneumonia require further confirmation [17]. In short, aberrant release of multiple cytokines appears to trigger a cytokine storm that produces immunopathogenic damage to tissues and organs, even while the immune response seeks to suppress and eradicate the virus (Fig. 1).",

Originally described as B-cell differentiation factor-2 (BSF-2) and macrophage and granulocyte induction factor-2 (MGI-2), IL-6 has significant pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic properties, and given chronic overproduction in COVID-19 patients, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody may be beneficial in controlling cytokine release. Also IL-17 inhibitor (Secukinumab) (Novartis) was used as specific treatment for severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [25] to control Th17 cell activation. An additional observation indicated that the expression levels of CD4+ T and CD8+ T were low, while IL-6 levels were high in patients with severe pneumonia, suggesting that T cell subsets and cytokine levels could be used as one predictor of the transition from mild to severe pneumonia [15].",

Early application of IFN and ribavirin moderately improved disease severity without affecting mortality [26].

Because HCoVs are single-chain RNA viruses and TLR7 agonist R837 (a synthetic single-chain RNA analog) stimulates IMMs which causes exuberant inflammatory response. Therefore, IMM specific TLR-7 signal may promote the excessive inflammatory response caused by HCoV infection. Therefore, a TLR7 antagonist targeted approach to alleviate inflammation reaction could be useful.",
