Diagnosis of influenza positive patients by POCT resulted in significantly higher rates of antiviral prescription. A number of the studies comparing POC with standard testing 16,18,40 attributed the increased antiviral use to faster turnaround time to diagnosis by POCT. Given that antivirals are of most clinical benefit if taken within 48 hours of symptom onset, 10,46,47 this is a key point. In the studies comparing positive and negative POCT results, the increased antiviral use in influenza positive patients is likely due to the removal of diagnostic uncertainty, which also commonly causes patients to be overprescribed antibiotics. 48 A positive result may eliminate unnecessary antibiotic prescription, whilst a negative POCT result may allow a bacterial infection to be treated promptly. This was evident in the 11 studies included in this review, which demonstrated that a positive POCT diagnosis led to decreased antibiotic use compared with a negative POCT result. 19,22,27,32-39 Shortening or eliminating avoidable antibiotic use can be of benefit by reducing risk from antibiotic resistance on both a patient and large-scale level.Length of stay is an important variable to consider when evaluating the effectiveness and quality of patient care.

The database search strategy was created with a focus on terms for influenza AND point of care testing, and these were combined with terms for any of the targeted outcomes-antibiotic use OR antiviral use OR length of stay.The specific search terms for influenza used for Embase included\"exp influenza\" [MeSh] OR \"exp influenza virus\" [MeSh]. By exploding these terms, we included all types of influenza as well as the different influenza subtypes. The search terms for point-of-care testing included \"exp point of care testing\" [MeSh] OR \"exp rapid test\" [MeSh] OR \"influenza a rapid test\" [MeSh] OR \"ridt.\" These terms contained subheadings that included brand names for the most commonly used commercial POCT for influenza.
