            "text": "The designation trypsin-like serine proteases has originally been used for a large group of soluble proteolytic enzymes, which are involved in digestion, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and immunity. Analyses of vertebrate genomes at the turn of the millennium have identified a novel subfamily of trypsin-like serine proteases that are anchored in the cell membrane, either by a carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain (type I), an amino-terminal transmembrane domain (type II), or via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage at the carboxy terminus. Over the past two decades, these membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) have emerged as key regulators of mammalian development and homeostasis in processes such as epithelial tight junction formation, skin development, epithelial sodium channel activation, cellular iron homeostasis, blood pressure, inner ear development, placental morphogenesis, neural tube closure, and male fertility. Moreover, dysregulated expression and/or activity of a number of MASPs is observed in many cancer tissues. Within the past decade, MASPs expressed in the human airways have furthermore been identified as host cell factors that may support proteolytic activation and spread of respiratory viruses including influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV).",

To date, the TTSP family comprises 18 known members in humans and 20 in mice. All members of the TTSP family share a common domain structure possessing a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal serine protease domain, and a variable stem region that may contain 1\u201311 protein domains of 6 different types (Fig. 8.1). The most prominent member of the TTSP, enteropeptidase, has been identified over a century ago by Pavlov and coworkers due to its essential role in food digestion; however, only the cloning of the enteropeptidase cDNA in 1994 revealed the presence of a membrane anchor and explained its localization to the plasma membrane of duodenal cells. The modular structure of the enteropeptidase protein was found to be similar to that of a previously cloned protease, hepsin (Leytus et al. 1988).\n",

They are synthesized as inactive single-chain zymogens that are activated by cleavage following an arginine or lysine residue within a highly conserved activation motif preceding the catalytic domain. After activation, the catalytic domain remains linked to the membrane-anchored domains by a disulfide bond but can also be released as a soluble protease (Hooper et al. 2001). All MASPs have a highly conserved S1 serine protease domain that contains the histidine, aspartate, and serine residues (catalytic triad) necessary for the catalytic activity (Fig. 8.2). In addition, all MASPs show a strong preference for cleavage of substrates after a basic residue (arginine or lysine) due to a negatively charged aspartate located at the bottom of the S1 pocket that is highly conserved in enzymes with trypsin-like activity (reviewed in Perona and Craik 1995 and Hooper et al. 2001). Accordingly, autocatalytic activation of several TTSPs has been observed in vitro, suggesting that some of the TTSPs could function as initiators of proteolytic cascades (Hooper et al. 2001).\n",

In the airway epithelium, HAT has been shown to be expressed at the apical membrane of ciliated cells, but not in goblet cells, submucosal glands, and mast cells (Takahashi et al. 2001). A number of studies suggest a potential role for HAT in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis (Chokki et al. 2004; Matsushima et al. 2006; Yasuoka et al. 1997; Yoshinaga et al. 1998). Among other functions HAT has been shown to cleave fibrinogen, to modulate structure and functions of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR, CD87), and to activate the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2). Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by serine proteases through specific N-terminal proteolytic cleavage and the unmasking of a tethered ligand. Activated PAR-2 plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and early inflammatory processes and has been reported to mediate allergic airway inflammation of the mouse airways in vivo (Schmidlin et al. 2002). HAT has been described to increase mucin gene expression and to stimulate bronchial fibroblast proliferation in airway epithelial cells through PAR-2-mediated signaling pathways (Yoshinaga et al. 1998; Matsushima et al. 2006).",

Moreover, induction of normal keratinocyte differentiation by calcium challenge was accompanied by an increase in DESC1 expression in vitro (Sedghizadeh et al. 2006). A recent study found that DESC1 sensitizes cells to apoptosis by downregulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/AKT pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Ng et al. 2016). Protease activity was required for this function, suggesting that DESC1 cleaves EGFR, which subsequently leads to the downregulation of the AKT pathway. Moreover, DESC1 has been demonstrated to reduce tumor growth kinetics in an orthotopic nude mouse model for study of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Taken together, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the association of DESC1 downregulation with cancer development. However, its tumor suppressive role remains to be characterized in more detail in future studies. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of DESC1 has been solved (Kyrieleis et al. 2007) and is shown in Fig. 8.2.",

In the 1970s, purification of enteropeptidase from porcine, bovine, and human intestine revealed that it consists of a heavy chain (82\u2013140 kDa) and a light chain (35\u201362 kDa) connected by a disulfide bond. Edman degradation of the amino-terminal sequence of the light chain of bovine enteropeptidase revealed its homology to other trypsin-like proteases. However, only cloning of the enteropeptidase cDNA in 1994 revealed the presence of a membrane anchor near the amino-terminus and indicated that the active two-chain form is derived from a single-chain precursor (Kitamoto et al. 1994).",

Enteropeptidase specifically cleaves trypsinogen at the activation site DDDDK\u2193I that is highly conserved among vertebrates (Zheng et al. 2009). Trypsin, in turn, activates a number of pancreatic zymogens such as chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidases, and prolipases in the lumen of the gut.

However, duodenase is synthesized as a zymogen, too, and requires activation by another protease. Moreover, the measured rate of activation of purified bovine recombinant proenteropeptidase by duodenase was about 70-fold lower than that by trypsin (Zamolodchikova et al. 2000).

The transmembrane domain anchors enteropeptidase in the brush border of duodenal enterocytes. In addition, mucin-like repeats in the SEA domain and N-linked glycosylation of the catalytic domain have been found necessary for apical delivery in MDCK cells (Zheng and Sadler 2002; Zheng et al. 2009). In addition, enteropeptidase is present as a soluble form in the small intestinal lumen. Shedding may be due to the action of biliary or pancreatic proteases and possibly to local effects of gastrointestinal hormones (G\u00f6tze et al. 1972). However, it remains unknown whether shedding of enteropeptidase plays a role in regulating its activity in the gut.",

Computer modeling suggested that this basic segment is located on the protein surface where it might bind the acidic P2\u2013P5 residues of trypsinogen activation sites. The crystal structure of the bovine enteropeptidase catalytic domain in complex with the inhibitor V-(D)4-K-chloromethane confirmed this extended substrate binding exosite (Lu et al. 1999). The K99 residue was identified as major determinant for recognition of the P2 and P4 aspartate residues. It is conserved among enteropeptidases of many species. Substitution of the lysine by alanine prevented enteropeptidase from cleaving trypsinogen (Lu et al. 1999). However, two-chain enteropeptidase cleaves trypsinogen about 500-fold more rapidly than does the isolated light chain (Lu et al. 1997), indicating that the heavy chain is necessary for optimal cleavage of trypsinogen.",

Immunohistochemical studies revealed that TMPRSS2 is also expressed in cardiac myocytes (Bertram et al. 2012). TMPRSS2 is associated with prostate cancer. The protease has been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue, and the TMPRSS2 level has been shown to be correlated with prostate cancer progression (Lucas et al. 2008, 2014; Chen et al. 2010). Moreover, fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter to E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor genes, particularly the ETS-regulated gene (ERG), resulting in overexpression of ERG is seen in nearly 50% of patients and is used as a prognostic marker of prostate carcinogenesis (Tomlins et al. 2005; Gasi Tandefelt et al. 2014). The TMPRSS2 gene and the ERG gene are located approximately 3 Mb apart in the same relative orientation on chromosome 21. However, the role of these gene fusions in the development and progression of prostate cancer is not understood in detail. The TMPRSS2 gene is furthermore flanked by the Mx1 (myxovirus resistance 1) gene, encoding a GTPase that is part of the antiviral response induced by type I and type III interferons (Paoloni-Giacobino et al. 1997; Verhelst et al. 2013).",

Studies on the subcellular localization of influenza A virus HA cleavage by TMPRSS2 upon co-expression in MDCK cells, however, indicate that TMPRSS2 cleaves HA in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or during its transport to the plasma membrane, where virus assembly and budding take place (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010, 2013) (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-75474-1_8#Sec25). In contrast, TMPRSS2 present on thecell surface and soluble TMPRSS2 shed from MDCK cells showed poor if any enzymatic activity and were not able to cleave HA (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010). The reason for the lack of TMPRSS2 activity on the cell surface and in cell supernatants is unknown and might be related to the expression of protease inhibitors or missing cofactors. However, intracellular activation of HA by TMPRSS2 revealed that TTSPs may not only act as proteolytic enzymes on the cell surface but can process theirsubstrates also (or already) in intracellular compartments.",

This was the first description of a protease involved in hearing loss. The TMPRSS3 gene maps onchromosome 21 at q22 and encodes for a protein of 454 amino acids with an overall domain structure similar to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. TMPRSS3 is synthesized as a zymogen and undergoes autoactivation (Guipponi et al. 2002). RT-PCR analysis and RNA in situ hybridization experiments revealed expression of TMPRSS3 in the thymus, stomach, testis, ovary, kidney, and eye and in a variety of inner ear tissues, including inner hair cells, stria vascularis, spiral ganglion neurons, modiolus, and organ of Corti (Scott et al. 2001; Guipponi et al. 2002, 2008).",

Mutations occur in all functional domains and have been shown to disrupt the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS3, indicating that TMPRSS3 protease activity is critical during inner ear development (Guipponi et al. 2002; Wattenhofer et al. 2005). It remains to be elucidated how missense mutations in the LDLA and SRCR domains affect the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS3. Studies in a mouse model carrying a protein-truncating nonsense mutation in TMPRSS3, Y260X (X = stop codon), revealed that TMPRSS3 is essential for mouse cochlear hair cell survival at the onset of hearing (Fasquelle et al. 2011). Mice expressing TMPRSS3-Y260X are completely deaf due to rapid and massive degeneration of hair cells. Moreover, loss of spiral ganglion neurons was observed in TMPRSS3-Y260X mice at the age of 4 months (Fasquelle et al. 2011). Proteomic analyses revealed that TMPRSS3 deficiency leads to a decrease in the expression of Kcnma1 potassium channels in inner hair cells (Molina et al. 2013). However, it remains to be investigated in more detail how TMPRSS3 regulates the abundance of functional Kcnma1 channels expression in hair cells. A recent study by Li et al. demonstrated that knockdown of TMPRSS3 inhibited cell viability of spiral ganglion neurons in vitro (Li et al. 2014). Moreover, they observed that microRNA miR-204 suppressed spiral ganglion neuron survival in vitro by targeting TMPRSS3 (Li et al. 2014). TMPRSS3 mRNA was found to have a putativemiR-204 binding site within its 3\u2032-UTR that is highly conserved among the vertebrates.",

The evidence for these functions, however, remains inconclusive since hepsin-deficient mice are viable and fertile, and do not exhibit obviousdefects in growth and blood coagulation (Wu et al. 1998; Brunati et al. 2015). Unexpectedly, a study by Guipponi et al. found that hepsin-deficient mice exhibited profound hearing loss (Guipponi et al. 2007). Hepsin knockout mice have abnormal cochlea and reduced myelin protein expression in the auditory nerve (Guipponi et al. 2007). Furthermore, low levels of plasma thyroxine, a thyroid secreted hormone important for cochlear development, have been found in hepsin-deficient mice (Hanifa et al. 2010). The molecular mechanisms by which hepsin regulates normal hearing are not understood, and so far it is unknown if hearing lossin hepsin-knockout mice is a result of thyroid hormone deficiency.",

It was proposed that HGF/c-Met signaling may regulate expression of connexins, gap junction proteins, in hepatocytes in mice. Loss of hepsin was found to increase expression of connexins, resulting in an expansion of hepatocyte size and a concomitant narrowing of sinusoids. Interestingly, systemic delivery of tumor cells by tail-vein injection showed preferential colonization of tumor cells in the liver of hepsin-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that loss of hepsin enhances the colonization of liver by tumor cells, probably through increased retention of tumor cells because of narrower sinusoids related to enlarged hepatocytes.",

Overexpression of hepsin in a mouse model of non-metastasizing prostate cancer caused disorganization and disruption of basement membrane and promoted primary prostate cancer progression and metastasis to the liver, lung, and bone (Klezovitch et al. 2004). Overexpression of hepsin also promoted ovarian tumor growth in a mouse model, and proteolytic activity of hepsin was shown to be necessary for promoting tumor progression (Miao et al. 2008). Hepsin and HGF are present in desmosomes. Desmosome dissociation is known to be one of the first steps during HGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicating that increased levels of hepsin and its substrate HGF may play a role in ovarian cancer progression through their interaction with desmosomes (Miao et al. 2008). At present, the mechanism of this interaction and the functional importance of hepsinlocalization in the desmosomes warrant further investigation.",

Guipponi et al. demonstrated that TMPRSS5-specific mRNA is furthermore present in inner ear tissues and the testis of rats (Guipponi et al. 2008). A mutation screen in a cohort of ca. 360 sporadic deafness cases revealed three mutations in the TMPRSS5 gene (A317L, F369L, and Y438X). These TMPRSS5 mutants showed reduced (F369L) or no (A317S, Y438X) proteolytic activity in yeast-based protease assays, suggesting that impaired TMPRSS5 activity might cause hearing impairment.

Knockdown of TMPRSS4 expression in lung and colon cancer cells by using siRNA reduced cell proliferation and invasion (Jung et al. 2008). A number of mechanisms, by which\nTMPRSS4 may modulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion, have been describedin vitro. Overexpression of TMPRSS4 in colon cancer cells promoted EMT through the upregulation of integrin \u03b15, thereby enhancing motility and invasiveness (Kim et al. 2010). In addition, TMPRSS4 was shown to induce invasion through upregulation of both expression and activity of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) via activation of the transcription factors AP-1, Sp1, and Sp3 and via processing of pro-uPA precursor into its active form in vitro (Min et al. 2014a, b). The serine protease uPA converts inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, which in turn can degrade most extracellular proteins and activate MMPs. Moreover, uPA and its receptor, uPAR (CD87), interact with integrin coreceptors to activate intracellular signaling pathways for cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Hildenbrand et al. 2008). It has been shown that TMPRSS4 can interact with uPAR (Min et al. 2014b). Furthermore, TMPRSS4 has been shown to induce downregulation of E-cadherin, a well-known hallmark of EMT, via activation oftranscriptional repressors Sip1/Zeb2 (Jung et al. 2008). Increased TMPRSS4 expression in cancer could be partially due to epigenetic dysregulation. The TMPRSS4 promoter has been shown to be hypomethylated in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (Stefanska et al. 2011; Villalba et al. 2016). Hypomethylation of TMPRSS4 promoter was associated with worse prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Taken together, TMPRSS4 may be an important upstream regulator of the EMT and the invasiveness of cancer cells and a useful biomarker for the prognosis of certain types of cancers and could be employed for diagnostics and therapeutics.",

TMPRSS4 cleaves the gamma subunit of ENaC at a site distinct from the site that is processed by the GPI-anchored protease prostasin (cf. prostasin chapter). However, a recent study demonstrated that regulation of the ENaC-mediated sodium balance is not affected in TMPRSS4-deficient mice (Keppner et al. 2015), indicating that TMPRSS4is not crucial for processing of ENaC in vivo.",

            "text": "\nMatriptase shows the most ubiquitous expression pattern of TTSPs being expressed in epithelial cells of most embryonic and adult tissues (Miller and List 2013). Matriptase has been shown to be required for postnatal survival in mice and has essential physiological functions in terminal differentiation of the oral and intestinal epithelium and the epidermis (List et al. 2002, 2003; Buzza et al. 2010). Mice deficient in matriptase die within 48 h after birth due to a severe dehydration resulting from an impaired epidermal barrier function. Matriptase is alsocritical for hair follicle growth and thymic development (List et al. 2002, 2003). Interestingly, it was observed that matriptase-deficient mice and mice deficient in expression of the GPI-anchored serine protease prostasin display identical epidermal phenotypes and that prostasin zymogen activation by matriptase is a key function in epidermal development (List et al. 2002, 2003; Netzel-Arnett et al. 2006; Leyvraz et al. 2005; also see prostasin chapter). These observations led to the hypothesis that matriptase may be part of a matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade in the epidermis (Netzel-Arnett et al. 2006). Moreover, this cascade has been shown to regulate different steps in terminal epidermal differentiation: tight junction formation, profilaggrin processing, epidermal lipid synthesis, and induction of desquamation through promoting expression or activation of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) (for review see Szabo and Bugge 2011). It remains to be analyzed in more detail which target substrates of the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade are involved in the different steps of epidermal differentiation. A number of studies during the last years, however, revealed that the matriptase-prostasin cascade is much more complex. While matriptase activates prostasin zymogen in the epidermis, prostasin is crucial for matriptase zymogen activation in the intestine and the placenta (Buzza et al. 2013; Szabo et al. 2016; cf. prostasin chapter).",

The second cleavage, which appears to be autocatalytic, occurs after R614 within the highly conserved R\u2193VVGG activation motif, converting the single-chain form into the active two-chain form. Co-expression of HAI-1 and HAI-2 has been shown to be necessary for matriptase expression, stability, and intracellular trafficking in vitro (Oberst et al. 2005; Larsen et al. 2013; Nonboe et al. 2017). Matriptase can be shed from the cell surface. Shed matriptase was identified originally in complex with an inhibitor HAI-I in human milk, and additional shed forms have been reported in conditioned media of cultured epithelial cell lines (reviewed in List et al. 2006a).",

Expression of matriptase is upregulated in a variety of epithelial cancers including breast, prostate, ovarian, cervical, gastric, colon, renal cell, esophageal, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (reviewed in Tanabe and List 2017). List et al. demonstrated that matriptase causes strong proliferation of keratinocytes and formation of squamous cell carcinomas when only modestly overexpressed in the epidermis of transgenic mice (List et al. 2006b). Matriptase may promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by converting pro-HGF and pro-uPA into its active forms, by degrading ECM components, or by activating PAR-2. Activation of matriptase by androgen-induced TMPRSS2 has been shown to promote prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer (Ko et al. 2015).",

The matriptase-2 zymogen (90 kDa) undergoes autocatalytic cleavage at R567 within the R\u2193IVGG activation motif and remains membrane-anchored through a disulfide bond linking the pro- and catalytic domains (Stirnberg et al. 2010). Soluble forms of matriptase-2 were detected in the conditioned medium of transfected cells. Interestingly, shedding of matriptase-2 has been found to be due to cleavage at R404 and/or R437 within the second CUB domain and seems to be required for converting matriptase-2 into the active form via cleavage at R567.

Systemic iron homeostasis is maintained by regulating the iron absorption in the duodenum, by recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes in macrophages, and by mobilizing stored iron in the liver. Increases in iron levels stimulate the production of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, which blocks iron export into the circulation by binding to and targeting the iron exporter ferroportin on the plasma membrane of duodenal enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes for degradation.Hepcidin production is suppressed in the case of iron deficiency (reviewed in Ganz and Nemeth 2012 and Wang et al. 2014). Therefore, hepcidin is a key regulator of intestinal iron absorption, plasma iron concentrations, and tissue iron distribution. Lack of hepcidin causes juvenile hemochromatosis, a particularly severe form of iron overload disorder. In contrast, inappropriately high levels of hepcidin cause chronic inhibition of iron absorption and consequent anemia (Ganz and Nemeth 2012; Wang et al. 2014).",

Similar phenotypes were also observed in mouse models deficient in TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 expression or with expression of a truncated protease form that lacks the catalyticdomain (Du et al. 2008). Thus, results in mice and humans indicated that TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 is required to sense iron deficiency in mammals.

Hemojuvelin is a coreceptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling pathway that upregulates hepcidin in response to increased iron (Babitt et al. 2006; Finberg et al. 2010). Cleavage of hemojuvelin by TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 downregulates BMP/SMAD signaling and inhibits hepcidin expression.",

            "text": "The PRSS8 gene encoding\nprostasin is conserved in all vertebrate species examined. In humans, the\nPRSS8 gene is located on chromosome 16p11.2 and encodes a protein of 343 amino acids. Prostasin is GPI-anchored in the cell surface and associates with lipid rafts (Chen et al. 2001b; Verghese et al. 2006). In polarized cells, prostasin is present on the apical membrane.Using substrate libraries, prostasin was shown to have a preference for polybasic substrates with R/K in P4, H/K/R in P3, basic or large hydrophobic amino acids in P2, and R/K in P1 (Shipway et al. 2004). No activity was seen with substrates containing isoleucine in P1\u2032, providing an explanation for prostasin being not capable of undergoing autoactivation (Shipway et al. 2004). Prostasin zymogen conversion in the epidermis requires matriptase (Netzel-Arnett et al. 2006; cf. matriptase chapter). The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of prostasin has been solved (Rickert et al. 2008). Prostasin has been shown to be an essential regulator of the ENaC and thereby regulates the homeostasis ofextracellular fluid volume, blood pressure, and intestinal sodium and water absorption (Frateschi et al. 2012; Plan\u00e8s et al. 2010). Prostasin cleaves the ENaC gamma subunit atK186 within the cleavage motif RKRK\u2193 distal to a furin cleavage site at R144 (RKRR\u2193) (Bruns et al. 2007). Dual cleavage of the gamma subunit releases a 43-amino acid inhibitory peptide and causes full activation of the channel, resulting in an increased cellular uptake of Na+. Studies show that prostasin is highly expressed in cystic fibrosis airways and is a strong basal activator of ENaC in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (Donaldson et al. 2002; Tong et al. 2004). Increased levels of soluble prostasin are also found in urine of hypertensive patients (Narikiyo et al. 2002). Prostasin may be released from the cell surface by an endogenous GPI-specific phospholipase D1 or via cleavage in its C-terminal hydrophobic domain (Yu et al. 1994; Verghese et al. 2006). Soluble prostasin purified from human seminal fluid terminates at R323 (Yu et al. 1994). On the other hand, prostasin expression is reduced in a number of cancers including prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers, and prostasin has been shown to inhibit prostate and breast cancercell invasion in vitro (Chen et al. 2001a; Chen and Chai 2002; Bao et al. 2016).",

Moreover, constitutive knockout of prostasin leads to embryonic lethality due to placental insufficiency (Hummler et al. 2013). The identical phenotypes of matriptase- and prostasin-deficient mice suggested that both proteases are components of one proteolytic cascade (reviewed in Netzel-Arnett et al. 2006; cf. matriptase chapter). This hypothesis, however, proved incompatible with studies demonstrating that prostasin acts upstream of matriptase in intestinal epithelial cells and in the placenta through matriptase zymogen activation (Buzza et al. 2013; Szabo et al. 2016). Thus, the prostasin-matriptase cascade turned out to be more complex thanpreviously thought.",

            "text": "Paradoxically, a number of studies revealed that prostasin requires neither zymogen conversion nor catalytic activity to execute its essential functions in the epidermal development (Peters et al. 2014; Friis et al. 2016). Already in 2006/2007, studies by Andreasen et al. and Bruns et al. reported that catalytically inactive prostasin mutant S238A was able to activate ENaC in Xenopus oocytes in vitro, indicating that the catalytic activity of prostasin appears to be dispensable for cleavage of the ENaC gamma subunit (Andreasen et al. 2006; Bruns et al. 2007). But cell surface expression of prostasin via the GPI anchor was essential for ENaCactivation. More recent studies in mouse models expressing catalytically inactive prostasin mutant S238A or zymogen-locked mutant R44Q revealed that prostasin supports both epidermal development and long-term survival in a non-catalytic manner (Peters et al. 2014; Friis et al. 2016). In contrast, prostasin proteolytic activity was found to be crucial for matriptase zymogen activation in the placenta (Szabo et al. 2016). In addition, mice expressing catalytically inactive or zymogen-locked prostasin displayed impaired hair follicle development and delayed skin wound healing, indicating that some of the physiological functions of prostasin require its proteolytic activity. The V170D (low enzymatic activity) and the G54-P57 deletion mutations of prostasin have been identified in mouse frizzy (fr) and rat hairless (frCR) animals, respectively, and have been proposedto be responsible for their skin phenotypes (Spacek et al. 2010; Szabo et al. 2012).",

The serine protease acrosin has been long believed to participate in limited proteolysis of ZP, thus enabling sperm to penetrate the egg coat. However, acrosin-deficient mice were fully fertile, although they displayed delayed sperm penetration of the ZP at the early stage of fertilization in vitro (Baba et al. 1994), indicating that additional serine protease(s) play important roles in the regulation of male fertility. Mice deficient in testisin expression are fertile, too, but display deformed spermatozoa with an increasedtendency toward decapitation and reduced motility (Netzel-Arnett et al. 2009). Testisin was found to direct murine sperm cell maturation and sperm-fertilizing ability during passage of spermatozoa through the epididymis to their site of temporary storage in the cauda (Netzel-Arnett et al. 2009). Combined knockout of acrosin and testisin in mice impairs fertility in vivo and causes complete loss of fertilization ability in vitro, which suggests that sperm trypsin-like activity is indispensable for in vitro fertilization but not particularly for fertilization in vivo in mice. Interestingly, these data suggest that the female reproductive tract partially compensates for the loss of the sperm function, presumably due to thepresence of an acrosin-/testisin-like protease (Kawano et al. 2010; reviewed in Szabo and Bugge 2011).",

Relevant HA-activating proteases in the human airways were unknown for a long time. Cleavage of HA by soluble proteases such as trypsin in cell culture takes place outside the cells during assembly and budding of new virions when HA is present on the plasma membrane or after progeny virus is released from the infected cell. Thus, it was believed for a long time that HA with a monobasic cleavage site is activated extracellularly and, therefore, differs from HA of HPAIV, which is cleaved in the TGN by furin.",

More recent studies on cleavage of human influenza A virus HA by kallikrein (KLK) 5 and 12 showed that H1 is cleaved by both KLK5 and KLK12 in vitro, whereas H2 and H3 are only cleaved by KLK12 and KLK5, respectively (Hamilton and Whittaker 2013). Furthermore, the sensitivity of 16 HA subtypes to cleavage by TMPRSS2, HAT, and pancreatic trypsin was demonstrated to vary significantly among the different subtypes (Galloway et al. 2013; see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-75474-1_1). Interestingly, studies in TMPRSS2-deficient mouse models demonstrated that differences in the sensitivity of HA to cleavage by host proteases may affect influenza virus spread and pathogenesis (Hatesuer et al. 2013; Tarnow et al. 2014; Sakai et al. 2014) (see below). The mechanisms underlying protease specificity of HA with monobasic cleavage site, however, are still unknown and may be related to the structure and exposure of the cleavage site loop or steric hindrance by adjacent carbohydrate moieties (Kawaoka et al. 1984; Sakai et al. 2015).",

            "text": "The identification of membrane-bound HA-activating proteases raised the question where in the host cell and at which step of the viral replication cycle the viral glycoproteins are cleaved by TTSPs. The subcellular localization and enzymatic activity of HAT and TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells have not been investigated in more detail so far but have been studied in MDCK cells that proved to be a suitable model system (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that activation of influenza virus HA by HAT and TMPRSS2 differs in subcellular localization and can take place at different steps of the viral life cycle (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010, 2013; Fig. 8.3b). Incubation of HAT-expressing MDCK cells with fluorogenic peptides to measure the protease activity on the cell surface revealed that HAT is present as an enzymatically active protease on the cell surface. In addition, it was shown that HAT is capable of cleaving newly synthesized HA0, probably during assembly and budding of new virions on the plasma membrane, as well as HA0 of incoming influenza virus at the stage of entry during attachment to a new host cell. In contrast, only poor if any enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 was measured on the surface of TMPRSS2-expressing MDCK cells, and the cells were not able to support activation of incoming influenza virions containing HA0, although TMPRSS2 was present as both zymogen and mature form on the surface of MDCK cells (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010). Cleavage of HA was found to take place intracellularly during its transport through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8.3b). Immunofluorescence studies of transient TMPRSS2 expression in mammalian cells revealed that the protease accumulates in the TGN, where it co-localizes with furin, suggesting that HA cleavage by TMPRSS2 and furin occurs in the same cellular compartment (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2013). These data were in agreement with earlier studies by Zhirnov et al. that showed that cleavage of HA in human respiratory or intestinal epithelial cells occurs intracellularly and is performed by cell-associated proteases (Zhirnov et al. 2002; Zhirnov and Klenk 2003). These studies provided further evidence that cleavage of influenza virus HA can occur at different steps of the viral life cycle: during transport of HA along the secretory pathway to the cell surface, on the plasma membrane during assembly and budding, and late in infection upon entry into new cells (Boycott et al. 1994; Zhirnov et al. 2002; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010). However, shedding of TTSPs may be enhanced under stress, and soluble forms might contribute to virus activation under such conditions. For example, enhanced shedding of TMPRSS2 and HAT from human nasal epithelial cells and hence enhanced influenza virus replication have been observed upon exposure to ozone in vitro (Kesic et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Studies on proteolytic activation of the spike protein S of human CoV including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by HAT and TMPRSS2 revealed also that viruses may have different options to be activated by host cell proteases during the viral replication cycle (Fig. 8.3b). CoV S proteins possess two distinct cleavage sites, S1/S2 and S2\u2019, and can be cleaved by a number of proteases, including furin, cathepsin L, and trypsin, and trypsin-like proteases such as the TTSP HAT, TMPRSS2, DESC1, and MSPL (reviewed in Millet and Whittaker 2015, and Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-75474-1_4 this book; see also Fig. 8.3). Cleavage of S by cathepsins occurs in late endosomes or lysosomes and is pH dependent, whereas activation by TTSPs may support cathepsin- and low pH-independent CoV entry via fusion in early endosomes in vitro (Burkard et al. 2014; Millet and Whittaker 2015; Park et al. 2016). Both HAT and TMPRSS2 are believed to cleave S at or close to the cell surface (for review see Chap. 4). It remains to be investigated whether TMPRSS2 and/or HAT are present (and active) in endosomes. It further remains to be investigated why TMPRSS2 may cleave CoV S but not influenza virus HA at the cell surface. For some CoV, receptor binding has been shown to be required for proteolytic activation of S. Treatment of SARS-CoV particles with trypsin prior to binding to its receptor angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inactivates the virions in vitro, whereas SARS-CoV particles bound to its receptor are activated by trypsin for membrane fusion (cf. Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-75474-1_4). Moreover, TMPRSS2 has been shown to cleave ACE2 and thereby to increase SARS-CoV S uptake into ACE2-expressing cells in vitro (Heurich et al. 2014). Thus, receptor binding of S or interactions of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 might trigger S cleavage by TMPRSS2 at the plasma membrane. In general, CoV are believed to be proteolytically activated upon entry into cells, but newly synthesized S may also be activated prior to virus release from the infected cell (Fig. 8.3b). The subcellular compartmentalization of S cleavage during its transit through the exocytic pathway and/or virus assembly and budding at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (reviewed in Ujike and Taguchi 2015), however, are not understood in detail.",

            "text": "In three recent independent studies, TMPRSS2 was identified as the solely HA-activating protease and as a host cell factor essential for spread and pneumotropism of human H1N1 and H7N9 influenza A viruses in mice (Hatesuer et al. 2013; Tarnow et al. 2014; Sakai et al. 2014). Intriguingly, knockout of TMPRSS2 expression prevented virus activation and consequently spread into the lungs and thereby protected the animals from influenza pathogenesis, whereas wild-type littermates succumbed to severe infection. These studies also revealed that other TTSPs that activate H1N1 virus in vitro, such as HAT/TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS4, DESC1, or MSPL, do not support HA activation in mice in vivo. For HAT/TMPRSS11D, this can be explained by the fact that the protease is expressed in the upper airways, trachea, and bronchi of mice, but is not present in the lungs and, thus, cannot support influenza virus pneumotropism (Sales et al. 2011; Tarnow et al. 2014). The same is probably true for DESC1. However, TMPRSS4 and MSPL/TMPRSS13 are present in lung tissue (K\u00fchn et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2001), and it remains unclear why both proteases do not support activation of H1N1 and H7N9 influenza virus in the airways of TMPRSS2-deficient mice. Noteworthy, replication of human H3N2 influenza A virus and influenza B virus (IBV) was almost independent of TMPRSS2 expression in mice, indicating that H3 and IBV HA can be activated by additional host proteases in contrast to H1 and H7 (Tarnow et al. 2014; Sakai et al. 2016). In a recent study, knockout of both TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS2 caused reduced body weight loss and mortality upon H3N2 influenza A virus infection in mice in comparison with wild-type animals, indicating that both proteases contribute to activation of H3N2 virus in mice (K\u00fchn et al. 2016). Nonetheless, H3N2 influenza A virus was still proteolytically activated in TMPRSS2-TMPRSS4-knockout mice and caused severe disease with 30% mortality, indicating that another H3-cleaving protease(s) is present in murine airways. MSPL/TMPRSS13 might be a potential candidate.",

In addition, TMPRSS2 emerged as a potential drug target for influenza treatment. It will be very interesting to analyze the role of TMPRSS2 and further TTSPs in activation and pathogenicity of other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and human parainfluenza viruses using suitable mouse models. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the TMPRSS2 gene that results in higher TMPRSS2 expression has been associated with increased susceptibility to H1N1 and H7N9 influenza virus and higher risk of severe infection, suggesting that TMPRSS2 may play a crucial role in influenza virus activation also in humans (Cheng et al. 2015). This view is supported by the observation that knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression in the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 strongly suppressed activation and multicycle replication of human H1N1 influenza A viruses (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2011). Interestingly, knockdown of TMPRSS2 also strongly suppressed H3N2 virus replication in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that the differences in protease specificity of influenza virus HA observed in mice might be less pronounced in humans. However, further studies are needed to understand the role of TMPRSS2 in influenza virus activation in humans.",

            "text": "Described for the first time two decades ago, a number of MASPs have already been established as important regulators in mammalian physiology. However, for many MASPs the physiological functions and/or substrates are not fully characterized or still unknown at all. The TTSP TMPRSS2 was identified as influenza A virus-activating protease in human airway cells and in mice and as host cell factor essential for pneumotropism and pathogenesis of certain influenza A virus strains infecting humans in mice. The role of TMPRSS2 in activation of further respiratory viruses in vivo remains to be investigated, and its important role in influenza virus activation in humans needs to be demonstrated. As mentioned above, a number of TTSPs that have been shown to activate HA in vitro and to be present in the respiratory tract, including TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS13, were not able to compensate for the lack of TMPRSS2 expression in influenza virus activation in mice. Thus, if there is some redundancy among MASPs in processing of physiological substrates, and this is very likely, it is not the case for cleavage of HA. The underlying reasons are unclear so far. Detailed information on the substrate specificity of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 is missing due to the lack of suitable systems for expression and purification of these proteases and available structural information of the protease domains. To date, the crystal structure of the protease domain has been solved for hepsin, DESC1, enteropeptidase, matriptase, and prostasin. Moreover, differences in (1) subcellular compartmentalization and activity, (2) expression levels, and/or (3) distribution in different airway cell types of TMPRSS2 in comparison with other TTSPs might account for the observed differences in activation of influenza A viruses. In particular, the compartmentalization of MASP activity should be investigated in more detail in future studies. MASPs are predicted to act as active enzymes on the cell surface, but studies on activation of influenza A virus HA by TMPRSS2 showed that cleavage takes place intracellularly, probably in the TGN. Thus, some MASPs may process their substrates already (or even exclusively) in intracellular compartments. Expression and enzymatic activity of MASPs in endosomes and lysosomes have not been studied so far but may play a role in processing of both physiological substrates and viral fusion proteins. Furthermore, the role of soluble MASP activity due to shedding of the catalytic domain is poorly understood.",

Potent inhibitors for some MASPs have already been developed (for review see Steinmetzer and Hardes, this book), but no inhibitor of host proteases has been approved for the treatment of virus infections to date. The development of highly selective MASP inhibitors is hampered by the lack of available crystal structures of the catalytic domain as well as knowledge on the role of the different domains of the stem region in substrate specificity, protease conformation, and protein-protein interactions. It remains to be analyzed whether some TTSPs are upregulated during virus infection and thereby may support enhanced virus activation and/or organ tropism. Moreover, it will be interesting to analyze whether dysregulation of MASPs contributes to the susceptibility to virus infection.",

(a) Schematic illustration of the precursor proteins HA0 and S of influenza A virus and coronaviruses (CoVs), respectively, and cleavage sites (red arrows). HA0 is cleaved into HA1 and HA2; both subunits remain linked by a disulfide bond. HA0 of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses is activated at a multibasic cleavage site, while HA0 of low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses and mammalian influenza A viruses is cleaved at a single basic residue. CoV S protein is cleaved at two distinct sites at monobasic motifs or the minimal furin consensus motif RXXR. The S1 and S2 domains are not held by disulfide bonds but remain associated non-covalently (Millet and Whittaker 2015). FP, fusion peptide. TM, transmembrane domain. Basic amino acids crucial for cleavage by relevant proteases are written in bold letters. (b) Compartmentalization of activation of HA and S by host cell proteases. The envelope proteins HA and S mediate virus entry into cells through receptor binding and fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes. Fusion delivers the viral genome into the host cell and initiates viral replication and generation of progeny virions. Newly synthesized virions are finally released via budding at the plasma membrane (influenza A virus) or at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and subsequent exocytosis of new virions at the cell surface (CoV). HA and S require cleavage by host cell proteases to gain their fusion capacity. In the case of influenza A virus, newly synthesized HA is cleaved during its transport to the plasma membrane by furin (multibasic cleavage site) or TMPRSS2 (monobasic cleavage site) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or at the cell surface by HAT during assembly and budding of progeny virus. Thus, virus containing cleaved HA is released from infected cells. HA can also be cleaved by HAT on the cell surface prior to entry into a new cell. In contrast, TMPRSS2 present on the cell surface does not support HA cleavage. It remains unclear whether HAT is enzymatically active within the cell and thus can cleave HA already during its transit to the plasma membrane. Most CoVs, including SARS- and human 229E-CoVs, are released with non-cleaved S from the infected cells, indicating that S is not activated during its transit through the exocytic pathway. Therefore, the S protein of CoV is activated upon entry into the host cell. Entry can take place via fusion at or close to the plasma membrane or in early endosomes (\u201cearly entry\u201d) and may be pH-independent or via late fusion in late endosomes (\u201clate entry\u201d) in a low pH-dependent manner. Early or late fusion seems to be dependent on the protease(s) that cleave S at the S2\u2019 site. Cleavage of S by furin and TTSPs is believed to support an early entry (e.g., MERS-CoV), whereas activation of S by cathepsins supports late entry via fusion in late endosomes (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59) (Burkard et al. 2014; Millet and Whittaker 2015; Park et al. 2016). Newly synthesized S protein of some CoV, including MERS-CoV, has been reported to be cleaved by furin or TTSPs in the exocytic pathway, but the role of S cleavage in the secretory pathway for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion remains to be investigated in more detail. It also remains unknown whether furin and/or TTSPs such as TMPRSS2 are present as enzymatically active enzymes in the ERGIC and might cleave S in this compartment",
