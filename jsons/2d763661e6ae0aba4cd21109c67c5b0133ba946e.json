Recently, a phylogeny was constructed from all known American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HRV sequences. From this study, three HRV classifications (HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC) were determined and techniques for classifying new isolates of HRV were reported. The genetic change of this virus in specific populations over time is of great interest to understand the evolution and epidemiology of viruses. To facilitate the collections of HRV sequences over a number of years, a virology experiment was designed in which students test nasal lavage samples to look for HRV infection. Students will learn a variety of techniques including RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis as well as bioinformatic skills though examination of sequences from the HRV-field isolates. Furthermore, students can look at symptom data from subjects to investigate correlations between symptom severity and factors such as stress and sleep patterns. Such information can be used to examine hypotheses regarding HRV mutation, symptom severity and epidemiology.",

A productive viral infection must spread virus to other hosts to continue the viral life cycle, and the study of viral spread in a population is a principle concern of viral epidemiology. Viral epidemiology not only examines how a virus functions in the host but also opens a window into human habits and interactions. Some viruses are transmitted through aerosols, others via an oral/fecal route, and still others through the transmission of bodily fluids [1] . Thus, many viruses thrive by taking advantage of host habits. By understanding how viruses replicate and spread, students can gain insight into the functions of viruses, cells, and evolution. Many viruses quickly adapt to environmental changes through error-prone replication, resulting in mutations and the generation of viral quasi species in which many genotypes coexist simultaneously during replication in the host cells. Subsequent infection in a new host results in replication by viruses fit for a particular environment [1, 2] .",

Picornaviruses are positive (mRNA-like), single-stranded RNA viruses, encased in a 30-nanometer icosahedral protein capsid. Their genomes contain roughly 8,000 nucleotide bases that code for 12 proteins [1, 3] . HRV has a well-characterized genome with three main classifications currently identified: HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC. During replication, millions of viral particles are made; however, the nucleic acids are not exactly identical. The HRV polymerase is error prone, and so several mutations occur through each round of replication. Thus, each viral nucleic acid can be slightly different. These variants are referred to as viral quasi species and enable HRV to adapt to the host [1, 2] .",

Briefly, stress was assessed through a subject's rating his or her average stress level on a 1-5 scale with 5 being the most severe. The quality and duration of sleep was assessed based on the reported number of hours (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The severity of symptoms was determined by subjects rating each of their cold symptoms on a scale of 0-4 (4 most severe) and adding the resultant scores together to give a final symptom score. The symptom score was then adjusted to a 1-10 scale. A two-tailed t test was then used to determine the significance (GraphPad Software, Inc http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ index.cfm).",

Standard PCR was used to generate enough genetic material for sequencing, and students retrieved sequences from the service provider website and submitted them as BLAST queries to identify to which ATCC strain their HRV samples were most similar [11] . The analysis revealed that two of the six samples were variants of HRV1 with 97% of the sequence identical with the ATCC reference strain. The other samples were identified as being similar to ATCC reference strains HRV2, HRV16, and HRV85. The sequences were aligned with each other and ATCC reference strains using Clus-talW2 and a group tree cladogram was generated (Fig. 3 ) [12] . From a research perspective, the sequence data is most interesting because, as samples are sequenced yearly, it will be possible to create a genetic database of HRV strains found in a college-aged population and to do further analysis on many levels. Indeed, a discussion was initiated with the students on how the nucleotide variations between their samples and the ATCC strains may influence the ability of the virus to elude the immune system, replicate or spread between hosts.",

This information can help in answering questions such as: What types of mutation occur? What types of HRV are prevalent? What percentage of the respiratory infections is HRV? Who contracts HRV? How does this correlate to sleep habits and stress levels? By creating such a dataset, insight can be gained regarding HRV infection and mutation in a college population. ",

Next, 16 lL of viral RNA were added to each tube. An upscaled master mix was prepared and apportioned for multiple samples. Reverse transcription was performed in a thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) with the following program: 258C for 5 minutes, 428C for 10 minutes, 508C for 20 minutes, and 858C for 5 minutes.qPCR-One Method of Looking for Viral Presence in Collected Samples qPCR was performed on the cDNA from samples (Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR System, Carlsbad, CA) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The primers amplify 400-bp region of the noncoding region of HRV [5]. The primer stocks were resuspended in water at a concentration of 200 lM each. A 150-lL mix of the forward primer mix was made by adding 18.75 lL of each P1-1 primer to 93.75 lL water for a final concentration of 25 lM for each primer (Supporting Information 2). The P3-1 primer was diluted 1:8 to a final concentration of 25 lM. A 20-lL reaction was performed using 1 lL of cDNA, 10 lL of the SYBR Green Master mix, 1 lL of forward primer mix, (P1-1, B1: CAAGCACTTCTGTTTCCCC B2: CAAGCACTTCTGTTACCCC B3: CAAGCACTTCTGTCTCCCC) and 1 lL of the reverse primer (P3-1: ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG) (2 lM), and 7 lL of water in 0.2-mL clear-topped strip tubes (BioExpress, Kaysville, UT)[5]. An upscaled master mix was prepared and apportioned for multiple samples.PCR and Agarose Gel Electrophoresis-Alternative Way of Determining Presence of VirusTwo rounds of PCR amplification were performed using (P1-1, B1: CAAGCACTTCTGTTTCCCC B2: CAAGCACTTCTGT-TACCCC B3: CAAGCACTTCTGTCTCCCC) forward primer mix and P1-3 reverse primer (ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG). The primer stocks were resuspended in water at a concentration of 200 lM each. A 150-lL mix of the forward primer mix was made by adding 18.75 lL of each P1-1 primer to 93.75 lL water for a final concentration of 25 lM for each primer. The P3-1 primer was diluted 1:8 to a final concentration of 25 lM. The PCR reaction contained 22.5 lL of the PCR Platinum SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) mix, 1 lL of P3-1 primer (ACGGACACCCAAAGTAG), 0.5 lL of the P1 mix, and 2.5 lL of cDNA for a total of 26.5 lL. The reaction was run with a touchdown PCR according to the reaction conditions in Supporting Information 2[5].",

Although positive and negative samples can easily be identified via qPCR, getting enough PCR products for the detection by gel electrophoresis can be hampered by RNA degradation. RNase-free reagents should be used at all times, and gloves are a must. Furthermore, delays in the procedure for isolating the RNA can result in degradation. Often, running a third PCR can be helpful in these situations. This extra step can be done by using 45 lL of the Platinum mix, 1 lL of P3-1 primer (25 lM), 1 lL of the P1-1 (25 lM), and 5 lL of the products from the previous PCR.",
