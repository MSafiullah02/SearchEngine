Coagulopathy is frequently reported [1, 2] and elevated D-dimer is a significant poor prognosis factor [3, 4]. Moreover, some authors have suggested a particularly high frequency of thromboembolic events, including fatal pulmonary embolism [5]. Use of heparin was associated with reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that thromboembolism prophylaxis is critical in the management of COVID-19 [6\u20138]. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis has recommended systematic pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all patients who require hospital admission for COVID-19 [9]. However, the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is unclear, particularly under thromboprophylaxis. Whether some clinico-biological parameters could predict venous thromboembolism risk and guide thromboprophylaxis management is also unknown. The objectives of the study were to determine the frequency and to identify predictive factors of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 inpatients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.",

In COVID-19, two retrospective cohort studies reported a high risk of thrombosis in patients hospitalized in intensive care units [12, 13], with a 25% incidence of venous thromboembolism without thromboprophylaxis [12]. Despite thromboprophylaxis in patients in intensive care, a cumulative incidence of 31% of symptomatic venous and/or arterial thrombosis was reported [13]. Our study was conducted in 2 medical units were all patients received optimal pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Our results highlight the high risk of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary, suggesting that standard thromboprophylaxis is insufficient in COVID-19 inpatients, even if not requiring initial intensive care. Interestingly, D-dimers level measured at hospital admission predicted venous thromboembolism risk, whereas other conventional risk factors such as age or body mass index did not. The negative predictive value of D-dimer for venous thromboembolism was clinically relevant when the level was < 1.0 \u00b5g/ml while patients with high levels (\u2265 3.0 \u00b5g/ml) had a particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism. Our data also suggest that D-dimers monitoring could improve risk estimate. The need for transfer to intensive care unit and/or for invasive mechanical ventilation was more frequent in patients who developed venous thromboembolism, although baseline clinical characteristics did not differ from patients who did not develop such event. This is consistent with the prognostic value of D-dimer levels in COVID-19 pneumonia, higher levels at admission being associated with critical presentation [4] and with higher mortality [3, 4]. Two studies demonstrated that systematic thromboprophylaxis reduces COVID-19 inpatients mortality for subjects hospitalized in medical wards [6, 7]. Whether this finding result from a reduction of fatal thrombotic events or from an anti-inflammatory of heparin effect is not known [14] but interestingly we found no correlation between fibrinogen and D-dimer levels in our study. Finally, the high frequency of thrombotic events could be explained by the host inflammatory reaction due to the direct involvement of endothelial cells by SARS-Cov2 [15].",
