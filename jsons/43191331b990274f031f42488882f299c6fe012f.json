            "text": "There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID19 that is causing a global pandemic. One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID19 is essentially unknow. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in biosystems from plants to humans. It includes why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell, and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense. Here we propose a striking yet plausible amplification mechanism in the immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our estimated results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 10 5 folds, resembling the cyclic O3-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases such as autoimmune disorders, multiple organ failure, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens (COVID19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.",

For instance, it was observed that genetic knockout of SOD produced deleterious phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice [8] [9] [10] [11] . Knockout mice lacking Mn-SOD died soon after birth or suffered severe neurodegeneration 8 . Mn-SOD was also shown to be required for protecting ROS-induced injury in O2 metabolism 11 . Mice lacking cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD developed multiple pathologies, including liver cancer 9 , muscle atrophy, cataracts, and a reduced lifespan 10 . Research on biological action of ionizing radiation (IR) also showed that modifying SOD activity in bacteria reduced the oxygen radiosensitizing effect and that SOD injection following whole body x-irradiation significantly protected Swiss mice from lethality 12, 13 . Also, active SOD or SOD mimic compounds inhibited IR-induced deleterious effects including transformation assays, bystander effects, normal tissue damage associated with inflammatory responses and fibrosis 14, 15 . These studies clearly demonstrated that O2 \uf0b7\u2212 was somehow participating in radiation-induced injury, whereas H2O2 (SOD) was required for normal physiological functions. Given that O2 \uf0b7\u2212 is a weak oxidant and the downstream formation of OH \uf0b7 from H2O2 is highly reactive to cause oxidative damage, the precise role of H2O2 (or O2 \uf0b7\u2212 ) in these critical physiological functions is essentially unknown 15 .",

Phagocytosis is the process by which a cell uses its plasma membrane to engulf a pathogen, forming an organelle called phagosome. It plays a major role in the innate immune defense by effectively killing of pathogens. The phagosome then moves toward the centrosome of the phagocyte and fuses with lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome for degradation of pathogens. A phagocyte has various receptors on its surface, including opsonin, scavenger and Toll-like receptors. For example, opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of pathogens coated with the Fc part of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. The widely accepted belief is that phagocytosis is most effective for killing bacteria, while the adaptive immune defense, mainly by lymphocytes, is more important for viral infections. However, increasing evidence has shown that phagocytosis plays a crucial role in killing a variety of intracellular or cytoplasmic viruses ranging from influenza, mumps, measles and rhinovirus to Ebola and HIV [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Some studies showed that phagocytes directly protect against viral infections 20-23 , while others indicated that the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis provides mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells and for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by antigen presentation or the secretion of inflammatory mediators [24] [25] [26] . Phagocytes play also a crucial role in removing dead and dying cells including virus-infected cells killed by lymphocytes, which otherwise often cause autoimmune disorders.",

First, the NADPH oxidases (NOX2) embedded in the phagolysosome membrane is activated to produce O2 \uf0b7\u2212 by O2 capturing an electron from cytosolic NADPH. H2O2 is generated from O2 \uf0b7\u2212 via superoxide dismutases (SOD) or heme(halo)peroxidases (MPO and EPO); OH \uf0b7 is then generated via the Haber-Weiss reaction. Through MPO/EPO, H2O2 activates a halogenating system, which generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and kills pathogens [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) also catalyze the production of NO \uf0b7 from L-arginine; NO \uf0b7 then reacts with O2 \uf0b7\u2212 to produce a peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ) that forms NO2 (via reaction with CO2) [32] [33] [34] .

Particularly HOCl has widely been used as a strong disinfectant [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] ; HOBr and HOI at lower levels were also detected in stimulated immune cells (leukocytes) 28, 30 . Macrophages have weaker antiviral properties than neutrophils and their activation is made by transient respiratory burst, which regulates the inflammatory response by inducing synthesis of cytokines for redox signalling. Due to the high toxicity of ROS/RHS/RNS, damage to host tissues can also occur during inflammation. Of particular interest is the role of endogenous RHS in the O2-dependent killing mechanisms of invading pathogens. In fact, HOXs (X=Cl, Br) are important halogen species causing O3 depletion in the Earth's stratosphere 35, 36 . They are derived from solar photolysis 37 or cosmic-ray driven dissociative-electron-transfer (DET) reactions [16] [17] [18] [19] of halogenated organic molecules, especially CFCs. In radiobiology, there is also a long mystery that the amount of primary ROS produced by IR at clinically relevant radiation doses (2Gy) is ~1000 fold lower than the background (endogenous) ROS level produced by oxidative metabolism of the cell, as first noted by Ward in 1994 38 . This leads to the question of how the ROS produced by the few primary ionization events is amplified to account for observed biological effects. The mechanism remains elusive, as reviewed by Lehnert. 15 This gives a vivid reminder of the 1970s when atmospheric scientists were curious to hypothesize that significant ozone loss might result in the Earth's stratosphere, giving birth of modern ozone depletion theory. An amplifying mechanism is now well established that a Cl atom can catalytically destroy up to 10 5 O3 molecules via halogen reaction cycles 35 . Note also that during respiratory burst, the increases in O2 (not NO \uf0b7 ) consumption were typically observed to be 2-20 folds only among different cells and/or conditions 39 . This, together with the mysterious critical physiological role of H2O2, implies that a drastic amplification mechanism is clearly required.",

These are schematically shown in Fig. 2 . Proposed halogen reaction cycles involved in the immune defense against pathogens and in the inflammatory process. The amplified reactions of reactive halogen species (RHS), including HOX, OX \u2212 , X 2 , X \u2022 and OX \u2022 (X=Cl, Br or I), produced by dissociative electron transfer (DET) within the phagosome cause major damage (represented by RX/RNX) to the DNA/RNA/lipids/proteins of phagocytosed pathogens. The innate immune defence system consists mainly of three components: the H 2 O 2 signaling pathway as the activator ('trigger'), the RHS reaction cycles as the 'accelerator' ('amplifier'), and the NO \u2022 signaling pathway as the deactivator ('terminator'). H 2 O 2 from other intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes can also diffuse across membranes and promote the anti-pathogen activity. 9 36 In biological systems, the halogenation of organic molecules is catalyzed by enzymes haloperoxidases such as MPO, EPO and LPO in normal physiological processes, which combine the inorganic substrates X \u2212 and H2O2 to produce RHS.

One should be cautious with some reaction rate constants listed in Table 1 as they are somewhat outdated. For example, most experiments by nanosecond-or picosecond-resolved radiolysis of aqueous halogenated molecules actually measured the DET with the hydrated electron (eaq \u2212 ) rather than the subpicosecond-lived prehydrated electron (epre \u2212 ). eaq \u2212 is deeply bound at ~3.5 eV and is relatively inert, while epre \u2212 has a small binding energy of 1.0-1.5 eV and is extremely effective for DET with halogenated molecules, as well demonstrated and reviewed previously [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] 18, 19 .",

Notably, the standard reduction potentials at pH 7 of all redox couples of the peroxidase cycle of enzymes MPO/EPO/LPO abundant in phagosomes are relatively small, being 0.8-1.3 V 28,30 , where RHS have generally large electron affinities. This means that the catalyzed cyclic reactions of RHS can readily take place and sustain for numerous cycles in the cell with those endogenous enzymes replacing solar photons or cosmic-ray-produced electrons. This is analogous to the established O3 depleting cyclic reactions. For example, X \uf0b7 and HOX with X=Cl, Br, or I can have the following cyclic reactions (bold represents altered targets such as damaged DNA/RNA/proteins): Note that cycle 1 including reactions (3a-3b and 3d-3f) or (4a-4b and 4d-4f) depends on H2O2, whereas cycle 2 including reactions (3a-3c and 3g-3j) or (4a-4c and 4g-4j) are H2O2 independent due to the DET of RN1X into a X \uf0b7 atom. In any case, however, the net effects of the above reaction cycles are the alternations (damages) of at least two biological targets R1NH and R2NH without consuming any halogen. Similar reaction cycles can also occur for other RHS such as XO \uf0b7 and X2. They are most effective (i.e., cycle 2 occurs), if the X \uf0b7 atom is yielded, which was indeed observed for radiolysis of N-bromoimides but not for N-chloroimides 42, 43 . Cycle 2 will be more significant with the formation of X2 in reaction (1) (as X2 + e \u2212 \uf0ae X \uf0b7 + X \u2212 readily), and therefore will become dominant as the halogen level reaches above a threshold. Indeed, X2 was observed 40, 41 . Cycles 1 and 2 are expected to continue for numerous cycles before they are terminated. Note that the peroxidase cycle [28] [29] [30] [31] in catalyzing the reaction (X \u2212 +H2O2 \uf0db HOX+ H2O) and the radical chain 42, 43 in radiolysis of N-halogenated species (R \uf0b7 +Br2\uf0aeRBr+Br \uf0b7 ; Br \uf0b7 +RH\uf0aeH + +Br \u2212 +R \uf0b7 . Net: Br2+RH\uf0aeRBr+Br \u2212 +H + ) have been proposed previously to enhance the reaction efficiency, but each of those cycles occurs at the consumption of a halogen species. They are therefore distinct from the O3-depleting-like halogen reaction cycles proposed here that have no cost of halogens (acting as 'catalysts'). Then a question arises: how would the halogen reaction cycles be terminated?",

Notably, NO3 \u2212 is known to be an extremely effective scavenger for weakly-bound electrons (NO3 has an electron affinity of 3.94 eV, larger than any halogen) 47, 49, 50 , as we measured the reaction rate constant being as large as 1.2(\u00b10.5)\u00d710 13 M \u22121 s \u22121 . 50 Reaction of CO3 \u2212 with electrons or O2 \uf0b7\u2212 is also expected (see Table 1 ). Thus, the halogen reaction cycles would be terminated if there is a significant amount of NO3 \u2212 or CO3 \u2212 (mainly NO3 \u2212 ) in the phagosome. Remarkably, the reduction or removal of nitrogen species (HNO3 as the ultimate product) is a critical requirement for the formation of the ozone hole (significant ozone loss) in the polar stratosphere 35 It is very instructive to compare the negative ion chemistry in the Earth's stratosphere and troposphere and that in phagosome, as shown in Fig. 3 . Both are quite similar, involving identical species of O2 \uf0b7\u2212 , CO2, NO, NO2, and ONOO \u2212 , except for O3 absent in the cell 19, 52, 53 . For negative ion chemistry in the atmosphere, the primary ions are quickly converted into CO3 \u2212 (H2O)n ions on the order of 10 \u22123 s by a series of reactions with O2, CO2, O3 and H2O 52, 53 . In the undisturbed stratosphere, the CO3 \u2212 (H2O)n ions are converted relatively slowly into the more stable ions NO3 \u2212 (H2O)n or NO3 \u2212 (HNO3)m(H2O)n on the order of 1s by reaction with the trace gases NO, NO2, HNO3, and N2O5 52, 53 . For altitudes below 30 km, the hydrated NO3 \u2212 ions are the dominant and terminal species. The positive-ion chemistry is even simpler and the cluster ions H3O + (H2O)n (n=3-6) are the sole primary ions since their formation is also rapid (10 \u22123 s). This is much shorter than the (positive) ion-(negative) ion recombination lifetime (i.e., the residence time of ions) of approximately 100-1000 s in the atmosphere 53 .",

We further notice that H2O2 is very stable, while the lifetime of negative ions including Cl \u2212 /Br \u2212 /I \u2212 and NO3 \u2212 is controlled by the recombination time with the abundant hydronium ions H3O + (H2O)n in the acidic phagolysosome, which are long-lived (expected to be \u2265100 s), in contrast to hydronium in neutral solutions. This is very similar for both the lower atmosphere and the phagolysosome. Given the Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 concentrations in phagocytes are 120 mM (mean) and 60 \u00b5M (mean) 44 and the rate constants of 3.1\u00d710 3 -2.5\u00d710 4 M -1 s -1 and 1.1\u00d710 6 -1.9\u00d710 7 M -1 s -1 for the converting reaction with H2O2 respectively 28, 30 , we calculate that the overall Cl and Br cyclic reactions occur with respective rates of approximately 360-3000 s -1 and 66-1140 s -1 .

These estimated values, fairly close to the ozone depleting reaction cycles in the atmosphere 35 , appear quite striking, but they are determined by the levels of Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 and the ion residence time. The latter is governed by the recombination with H3O + (H2O)n and is apparently quite similar in the stratosphere and in the phagolysosome.",

For the latter, RHS is known to be far more efficient than OH and NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone, and among RHS, Br or I is much more efficient than Cl at catalyzing the cyclic reactions 35, 36 . This proposed mechanism has multifold significance. 1) The H2O2-initiated halogen cyclic reactions should greatly amplify the pathogen-killing effects of RHS in the phagosome. It might lead to discoveries or identification of highly effective antiviral drugs to kill various viruses including severely aggressive viruses like current COVID19. 2) It also provides a long-sought amplification mechanism for reactive radicals produced by IR to generate significant radiobiological effects in human body, as compared with background ROS. 3) It reveals that H2O2 as a signaling molecule plays the key protective (pathogen-killing) role in immunological defence in many organisms from plants and animals to humans. 4) It also unravels the crucial physiological role of H2O2 to account for the observed critical effect of enzymes SOD [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

As noted by the reviewers, most of the MOAs to explain the therapeutic and/or adverse effects were hypothesized based on in vitro studies, and the link between the proposed MOAs and the clinical efficacy and in vivo safety is yet to establish. The proposed molecular MOA of HCQ during autoimmunity include the following processes. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that these antimalarial drugs are lipophilic weak bases, easily cross plasma membranes, and preferentially accumulates in lysosomes, causing increases in the pH of lysosomes from 4 to 6. 62 In lysosomes, HCQ inhibits the degradation of cargos in phagolysosomes by increasing the pH to prevent the activity of lysosomal enzymes. Elevation in pH causes inhibition of lysosomal activity including diminished proteolysis effect 63 , decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many consequences 64 . These effects are believed to cause a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and O2 \uf0b7\u2212 production by neutrophils 65 .",

Also, their unpublished data showed that two other immunomodulators, loxoribine and bropirimine, also activated immune cells through TLR7. Bropirimine (2-amin-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4(3)-pyrimidinone) is an immunomodulator that induces production of cytokines including IFN-\u03b1. It was in clinical use against renal cell carcinoma, but never got approved. There has been interest in searching TLR-activating agents for clinical use. Takeda et al 66 predicted that new therapies utilizing the TLR-mediated innate immune activation would be developed to treat several disorders such as infection, cancer, and allergy. Because of some structural similarity to these imidazoquinolines, there have been speculations that TLR7 and TLR9 receptors involve in the MOA of HCQ.

Here A is a quine ring system and X=Cl for HCQ and chloroquine, whereas A is an aromatic ring coupled to two NH2 groups at ortho positions [A=B(NH2)2] and X=Cln or Brn or In with n=1,2 for FMD compounds such as 4,5-dichloro/dibromo/diiodo-1,2-diaminobenzene and 4(5)-chloro/bromo/iodo-1,2diaminobenzene 58, 59 . We propose that these molecules are highly effective for DET reactions and their action is quire similar to the formation of endogenous RHS in the phagosome. It is long known that the DET reactions of halogenated aromatic organic molecules AXs are highly effective and exothermic 18, 19, 48, 49 . The exothermic energy for the DET reaction in water is EX-D(A-X)+Ep. Here EX is the electron affinity of a X atom (ECl=3.6 eV; EBr=3.4 eV; I=3.1 eV) or the neutral radical A \uf0b7 (EA=~3.5 eV) 67 , D(A-X) is the bond dissociation energy [D(C-Cl)=3.5 eV; D(C-Br)=2.9 eV; D(C-I)=2.5 eV], and Ep \u22480.6 eV is the polarization energy of a halogen ion X \uf02d in water estimated from the measured redox potential of O2 \uf02d (~1.0 eV) 68 . Thus, the exothermic energies for the DET reactions of AXs to form A \uf0b7 and X \uf02d (or A \uf02d and X \uf0b7 ) are estimated to be 0.7 (or 0.6), 1.1(or 1.2) and 1.2(or 1.6) eV, respectively for X=Cl, Br and I. These calculated data indicate that the DET reactions of AXs with weakly-bound electrons in water can effectively take place in phagolysosome, as shown in Fig. 4 .",

Since the DET reaction efficiencies are expected to increase in the order of Cl<Br<I for X in AXs, as we already observed for halopyrimidines (CldU, BrdU, IdU) 48, 49 , and more critically the DET reactions of Br-and I-containing aromatic ring molecules can readily produce Br \uf0b7 or I \uf0b7 atoms to activate cycle 2 reactions, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy should increase in the order of ACln<<ABrn<AIn (n=1,2).",

In contrast, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 4,5-dibromo-1,2-diaminobenzene was measured to be 240\uf0b125 mg/kg (i.p), and no significant multiple dose toxicity in blood, liver, kidney, gut and spleen for 90 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks in mice (i.v) were observed. The oral MTD, which is usually at least 5 times higher, may be over 1000 mg/kg. These results indicate that FMDs are essentially non-toxic but highly effective chemotherapeutic agents at used doses that can preferentially kill abnormal cells. It is therefore useful for natural targeted chemotherapy of cancer and other diseases, which potentially include viral infections and autoimmune disorders. By contrast, due to the increased risk of developing retinopathy during treatment with HCQ, the current ophthalmology guidelines recommend a maximal daily dose of 5.0 mg/kg (actual body weight) per day for HCQ, while in cancer studies, high HCQ doses up to 1,200 mg (17-18 mg/kg) daily was prescribed 71, 61 . Given these data, FMDs are estimated to have a clinical safe dose at least 10 times higher than HCQ in humans.

In these applications, the halogen compounds should provide strong pathogen-killing effects. During autoimmune, however, precaution should be taken if these drugs are to be used, because they will produce an excess number of exogenous RHS, much larger than that of endogenous RHS. In the latter case, using a NO (iNOS) inducer to enhance the production of the electron killer (NO3 \u2212 / CO3 \u2212 ) neutralizing RHS might be helpful to the patients. This paper provides a plausible molecular mechanism that might help the clinical practice of the drugs. It can improve the clinical efficacy, control the toxicity within a tolerated range, and suggest the optimal timing/sequential administration or possible combination therapy. This might meet the current medical challenges faced in this global pandemic and save many lives across the globe. Furthermore, this research also reveals that H2O2 is a necessary signaling molecules (angel) in the defense system fighting against pathogens and maintaining normal physiological functioning and signaling and its dysfunction can cause many diseases of plants to humans. The role of innate immune defense is probably underestimated under current context of immunology and virology. The new mechanistic insights into the immune defense might lead to discovery and development of more potent and/or targeted drugs for treatment of many diseases such as virus infection, cancer and others.",
