            "text": "Most organelles are composed of the same lipid membrane that creates the plasma membrane of the cell. This membrane is only two molecules thick and made of phospholipids. Phospholipids are a class of lipids; fats, oils, and waxes are other lipids. They are so named because the molecule has two parts: a polar head that contains a phosphate group, and a nonpolar portion that is composed of two fatty acid lipid tails (Fig. 3.2A\n). As described in the Chapter 2, \u201cVirus Structure and Classification,\u201d Refresher on Chemical Bonds, water is a polar molecule and readily associates with other polar molecules. The phospholipid head of the phospholipid, being polar, is hydrophilic, while the nonpolar tails do not associate with water and are hydrophobic. Because of this amphipathic nature of a phospholipid, a group of phospholipids placed in an aqueous solution (such as the environment of a cell) will spontaneously assemble into a double layer of phospholipid molecules with the hydrophilic polar heads of the molecules facing the aqueous solution and the hydrophobic nonpolar tails associating with each other (Fig. 3.2B). This forms an effective barrier to prevent large molecules from escaping or gaining entry into the cell. In the same way that the plasma membrane acts as a barrier for the contents of the cell, most of the organelles within the cell also use a phospholipid bilayer to wall off their contents from the cytosol of the cell.Word Origin: Endoplasmic ReticulumFrom the Greek endo, meaning \u201cwithin,\u201d and Latin reticulum, meaning \u201clittle net\u201d\u2014the little network within the cytoplasm.\n",

Ribosomes make proteins after binding to messenger RNA (coming from the nucleus). They can be found attached to the rough ER or \u201cfree\u201d (not attached) within the cytosol. Ribosomes attached to the rER will make protein that are subsequently transported into the lumen, or hollow inside, of the rER. Here, proteins are folded and modified; those that are modified with carbohydrates (including sugars) are known as glycoproteins, and proteins modified with lipids are termed lipoproteins.

Viruses do not have their own mitochondria and so will use the ATP generated by the cell. Cells also have a cytoskeleton made of different-sized protein components: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, from largest to smallest diameter. In the same way that a human skeleton shapes the form of the body and provides support for its organs, these cytoskeletal components provide structure for the cell and its organelles (Fig. 3.4\n).

The current view of how the membrane is assembled is known as the fluid mosaic model, proposed by Singer and Nicolson. The \u201cmosaic\u201d part of the model refers to the presence of proteins suspended in the membrane bilayer. Many proteins, including glycoproteins, are embedded into the lipid bilayer (Fig. 3.5\n). Known as integral proteins, these proteins have a variety of functions, including being receptors for extracellular substances or facilitating the adhesion of one cell to another. Peripheral membrane proteins associate closely with the surface of the membrane but are not integrated within it. The \u201cfluid\u201d part of this model refers to the proteins and phospholipid molecules that are noncovalently associated with each other and are therefore not static within the membrane but move around freely. Cholesterol is a lipid that is found in the phospholipid bilayer that helps to maintain the fluidity and movement in the membrane. Cholesterol is also enriched in lipid rafts, portions of the membrane that contain integral proteins involved in transmitting signals to the interior of the cell.",

Certain integral proteins transport ions and small molecules into or out of the cell, but many molecules are too large for these channel or carrier proteins. To address this problem, eukaryotic cells export and import larger molecules by exocytosis and endocytosis. In the process of exocytosis, proteins packaged into secretory vesicles by the Golgi complex travel to the plasma membrane. The secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the vesicle contents to the cell exterior (Figure 3.1, Figure 3.6\n). The vesicle membrane, also composed of a phospholipid bilayer, becomes part of the plasma membrane.Word Origin: Endocytosis and Exocytosis\nEndo is Greek for \u201cwithin\u201d and cyto means \u201ccell,\u201d so endocytosis is the process of bringing substances within the cell\u2019s plasma membrane.

There are two broad categories of endocytosis: bulk-phase endocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In bulk-phase endocytosis, the cell forms a vesicle that engulfs whatever molecules are present in the extracellular fluid, and so the process is nonspecific. On the other hand, receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated when specific ligands bind to receptors that are present on the cell surface. The cell has receptors on its surface for many biological factors, including growth factors and hormones. The cell imports the ligands by forming a vesicle that includes the membrane area with the receptors (Fig. 3.7A\n). These endocytic vesicles form in a specific area of the membrane called clathrin-coated pits. Clathrin is a protein that forms a honeycomb-shaped lattice on the intracellular membrane of the endocytic vesicle (Fig. 3.7B). A similar functioning protein, caveolin, forms membrane pits known as caveolae (singular: caveola).",

Instead of taking your whole desktop computer with you, you copy the single file onto a USB drive and leave the house.

In this analogy, your hard drive is your DNA that contains thousands of genes, and the temporary copy that left the house (nucleus) is the mRNA.

The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is the main set of scientific principles that underlies the field of molecular biology, which deals with DNA, RNA, and proteins.A replicate is an exact copy, and DNA replication is the process of copying DNA. To transcribe something is to rewrite it, and transcription is the process of creating a temporary RNA copy of an original DNA sequence. To translate something, on the other hand, is to change it from one language to another. Protein translation is the process of translating the language of RNA, made of nucleotides, into the language of proteins, made of amino acids.\n",

The carbons within the nucleotide base are numbered, and the carbons within the sugar are also numbered but each number is followed by a prime symbol (similar to an apostrophe) to distinguish the sugar carbons from the carbon in the base (Fig. 3.12A\n). In a growing strand of nucleic acid, the phosphate group of the nucleotide attaches to the sugar at the 5\u2032 (pronounced \u201cfive prime\u201d) carbon atom, and a new nucleotide is added to the 3\u2032 (pronounced \u201cthree prime\u201d) carbon of the sugar.

In the same way that transcription factors were necessary for RNA polymerase II to bind to the DNA gene to be transcribed, an assortment of translation initiation factors assists in recruiting the ribosome and the first tRNA to the mRNA transcript. The large ribosome subunit joints the small subunit.2.\nElongation: the synthesis of the protein out of amino acids. The ribosome moves along the mRNA strand. For each codon, a tRNA with a complementary anticodon enters the ribosome, delivering the corresponding amino acid. The ribosome joins the growing amino acid strand to the new amino acid. It continues moving along the mRNA, one codon at a time, and a tRNA containing the corresponding amino acid enters the ribosome for each codon. The new amino acid is joined to the previous amino acids, elongating the amino acid chain.\n3.\nTermination: the end of translation.

A long peptide chain is known as a polypeptide. When a ribosome translates mRNA, it creates a polypeptide of amino acids.So what is the difference between a polypeptide and a protein? A protein is a complete, functional entity. Some proteins are made of only one polypeptide chain, but other proteins are made of more than one polypeptide chain. Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen in our red blood cells, is a protein composed of four polypeptide chains in total. While discussing protein translation in this chapter, we assume that the polypeptide created by the ribosome will be a functional protein, but keep in mind that many proteins are composed of more than one polypeptide chain.\n",

Some viruses take advantage of the host splicing machinery to produce several mRNA transcripts from one precursor mRNA. HIV-1, for instance, produces most of its mRNAs from alternative splicing. Some viruses, like influenza, can snatch the 5\u2032-caps from host mRNAs to gain the necessary cap for the viral mRNA, leaving the host mRNA untranslatable without a 5\u2032-cap.

Ribosomes recognize and bind to the 5\u2032-cap of mRNAs, but some viral mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that allow ribosomes to bind within the mRNA sequence, without a 5\u2032-cap (Fig. 3.22A and B\n). IRES are used to initiate translation in internal sections of viral mRNA that are in a different reading frame, or when the virus has interfered with the normal translation process to inhibit host protein synthesis. Ribosomal frameshifting occurs when a ribosome pauses or meets a \u201cslippery sequence\u201d within a piece of mRNA. Instead of continuing to read the codons in frame, the ribosome encounters a problem and moves backward or forward one nucleotide. The result is that the ribosome begins translating a different reading frame than it was previously, producing a different mRNA and protein. Viruses like HIV utilize ribosomal frameshifting to encode several proteins within just one portion of DNA. A similar mechanism occurs with termination suppression, in which a stop codon is suppressed and the ribosome continues translating the mRNA, creating a polyprotein. Ribosomal skipping occurs while the ribosome is translating a viral mRNA. Viral proteins prevent the ribosome from joining a new amino acid to the growing protein chain, which releases the protein from the ribosome. Having not encountered a stop codon, however, the ribosome continues translating the remainder of the viral mRNA. The effect is that several viral proteins can be synthesized with only one piece of mRNA. Leaky scanning happens when a host ribosome encounters a start codon (AUG) within a piece of viral mRNA, but the Kozak consensus sequence (the nucleotides surrounding the start codon) is not in a favourable configuration. The ribosome may begin translation at this site, but the next ribosome that binds to the viral mRNA may continue past this weak start codon to begin translation at the next AUG encountered (Fig. 3.22C). The result is that one viral mRNA can encode two viral proteins. All of these transcription and translation processes promote the synthesis of viral proteins, often faster and with less energy than normal cellular mechanisms.",
