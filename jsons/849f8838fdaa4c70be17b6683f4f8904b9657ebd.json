In the present septic model, hyperdynamic shock with decreasing regional blood flow was observed. The hemodynamic changes were associated with a decreased urinary output. The capability to increase oxygen extraction was preserved. These results demonstrate that during sepsis renal blood flow and function are more dependent on systemic blood pressure than on systemic blood flow. ",

All patients had an LVEF < 40% (29\u00b17%) and a QRS-duration > 120ms (preoperatively 137\u00b125ms). Epicardial leads were attached to the right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle (at the base of the heart, near coronary sulcus). The hemodynamically stable patients were stimulated in the following PM-modes: AAI; DDD right atrial -right ventricular (RA-RV); DDD right atrialleft ventricular (RA-LV) and DDD right atrial -biventricular (RA-BiV). The pacing rate was set at 10 beats/min above the underlying rhythm (96 \u00b1 6 bpm) and the AV-delay was unchanged in all AV-sequential pacing modes. Standard hemodynamic measurements (Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter) were performed during steady state in all pacing modes. RESULTS: Dob/dop were weaned at 62 + 38 hours in Group 1 and at 120 + 48 hours in Group 2 (P< 0.002). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was 14 + 5 days in Group 1 and 22 + 8 days in Group 2 (P< 0.01).

The guideline development group felt that the critical appraisal methodology restricted fair appraisal of evidence, which was intuitively useful but generated by methodologies which did not rank high in the traditional hierarchy of evidence. Consultation with the Nursing Health and Social Care Research Centre at UWCM identified a novel method of Critical appraisal which focuses on assessment of the Internal and external validity of evidence. Internal validity assesses the scientific quality of evidence, external validity examines clinical applicability CONCLUSION: These findings lead to the concept of the \"Evidence Utilisation Cycle\" which employs a multi-disciplinary group of individuals with both clinical and academic backgrounds to analyse practice and use this novel method of critical appraisal to identify useful evidence and test its use in practice.",

The mechanisms underlying PFH-induced improvements remain speculative: a decrease of inflammation, a reduction of alveolar surface tension resulting in recruitment of alveoli and the prevention of endexspiratory alveolar collapse. Assuming the PFH effects to occur predominantly in ventilated lung areas, combining PFH vapor with an alveolar recruitment yielded by HFOV may improve gas exchange.",

Besides lower reduced tidal volumes, a decreased ventilation frequency, or 'lung rest', can be another approach to LPV. Induced hypothermia has been long utilized in the context of compromized oxygen supply. Owing to decreased metabolic rate, CO2 production during hypothermia would decrease, which would in turn translate into lung rest through decreased requirement for ventilation frequency.",

Clinical and microbiological variables were recorded. A multivariate analysis was performed to define the risk factors associated to global and related mortality to ICU-bacteriemia with septic shock using SPSS package (9.0). CONCLUSION: Nowadays the frequency and mortality rates of ICU-Bacteremic patients with SS remain excessively high. COPD, SOFA score and nosocomial origin of the bacteremia must be considered predictors of global mortality in these patients. Staphylococcus aureus is the unique microorganism independently associated to related mortality to bacteremia in this study. Avoiding inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment is mandatory to improve the prognosis of ICUbacteremia associated to SS.

It also regulates the functions of keratynocytes and colonic epithelial cells. These cells are involved in tissue repair process. Aim of this study is to verify Vit.D involvement in body response to surgical trauma by measuring serum levels of its active form 1-25(OH)2Vit.D and of its precursor 25(OH)Vit.D before and after gastrointestinal-tract surgery.",

However, whether screening of S-100 is helpful for the management of intracerebral complications and further surgical interventions in a country like Brazil has not been answered yet. Thus, the aim of this study was 1) to evaluate whether the measurement of S100 is feasible under clinical routine conditions of a Brazilian emergency department and 2) if the parameter could be used as a screening tool for intracerebral lesions in patients suffering from minor head traumas (MHT).",

Lung tissue concentrations of antibiotics administered for prophylaxis of pulmonary infections might be influenced by postoperative disturbances of ventilation and perfusion (1). METHODS: Levofloxacin (500 mg) was administered immediately after surgery. We measured the time versus concentration profile of levofloxacin in interstitial lung tissue and plasma in patients operated on CPB (n=6, A) vs patients operated with OPCAB (n=6, B) by in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: The concentrations of levofloxacin were significantly higher (P = 0.031) in the OPCAB group (16.34 \u00b5g/mL\u00b11.3) compared with patients operated on CPB (1.18ug/mL \u00b10,4) [Graph]. CONCLUSION: Data indicate that interstitial antibiotic concentration in lung tissue is influenced by ventilation/perfusion mismatch, a common pathophysiological mechanism associated with ARDS.

On the basis of one-factor logistic regression, among over 40 factors, only 5 factors were separated which in a statistically significant way increased the risk of PS development: failure of peripheral vessels (odd ratio OR 5.11), circulatory failure (OR 3.52), presence of complications at admission (ROC 3.47), and sensibility (OR 3.25). CONCLUSION: The low results of ROC coefficient and the relatively small number of separated risk factors indicate the necessity of finding additional factors directly connected with surgery and to develop on this basis a prognostic scale taking into account the specificity of PS development in critical patients subject to emergency surgery.

Calcium serum levels were reduced too (F.RM-ANOVA on Ranks: p=0.013). Post-operative reduction of 25(OH)Vit.D (% of basal levels) is more marked in 17 patients who presented in 1^day after surgery a CPR value higher than 12mg/dL (-60%\u00b125 vs -37%\u00b118, ANOVA:p=0.037); CPR 12mg/dL is the median value in our population. Our results indicate that extensive surgical trauma, as in gastrointestinal-tract surgery, is associated to a significant reduction in Vit.D serum levels. Reduction of 25(OH)Vit.D after surgery may be related to an increased synthesis of 1-25(OH)2Vit.D perhaps due to cells of innate immunity and particulary to macrophages that are the principal extra-renal source of 1-25(OH)2Vit.D (see relationship between PCR and 25(OH)Vit.D3 serum levels). Vit.D target cells can degrade 1-25(OH)2Vit.D to inactive forms. Our results support further study to better define Vit.D role in body response to surgery.

The presenting study was performed to confirm these findings in a larger population with respect to outcome and in comparison to other parameters of muscle damage and renal function.METHODS:With approval by our local ethics committee we analyzed data of 1,796 patients (567 female, 1,229 male) with a mean age of 63 \u00b1 17 years who were treated on an operative intensive care unit (ICU) between April 1998 and May 2002. In all patients, a complete blood profile had been obtained within 24 hours after admission to the ICU. For the statistical analysis, the highest values for serum myoglobin, serum creatinin and serum creatin kinase were used. Demographic data of survivors and non-survivors were compared by a Wilcoxon test. Sensitivity and specificity of organ function parameters in terms of outcome were analyzed by ROC-statistics and the area under the curve (AUC) compared by MedCalc\u00ae (Version 4.16e -Windows 3.1). A p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS:Survivors (n= 1,619survivors; 63 \u00b1 20 years) had a significantly lower serum myoglobin than non-survivors (n= 177; 63 \u00b1 17 years), i.e. 946 \u00b1 7,133 vs. 3,004 \u00b1 23,291 \u00b5g/l. With respect to outcome prediction, ROC-statistics revealed for serum myoglobin (AUC= 0.72), serum creatinin (AUC= 0.70) and serum creatin kinase (AUC= 0.57). For serum myoglobin (range 0.8 -159.550 \u00b5g/l) a cut-off value of 705 \u00b5g/l could be identified. The comparison of AUC's between serum myoglobin and serum creatinin revealed no significant differences. These both parameters showed a significantly higher AUC when compared to serum creatin kinase (p< 0.0001).CONCLUSION:Serum myoglobin correlated with outcome as survivors had significantly lower serum myoglobin levels than non-survivors within 24 hours after ICU admission. When compared to other parameters of muscle damage and renal function, serum myoglobin had not greater prognostic value than serum creatinin. However, serum creatin kinase was of a lower prognostic value. The results of this retrospective analysis need to be confirmed in appropriate prospective studies.REFERENCE(S): [1] Fricke P, Wei\u00df G, Lippert H (2002) Ischemia-/ reperfusion syndromemyoglobin: its impact and role as a prognostic parameter.

Some studies have demonstrated that reducing sedation in intensive care unit reduce the lenght of MV. The aim of this study was to assess the effect on MV duration: using a pre-established protocol for dose adjustment by nurses, by comparison to a conventional daily adjustment prescribed by physicians; using a short half-life hypnotic drug (i.e. Propofol (P) in comparison to Midazolam (M)).METHODS:Prospective open label study. All patients requiring MV in our ICU were included in the protocol. First phase: from Dec. 2001 to April 2002, physicians prescribed M and Fentanyl (F) doses. Second phase: from May 2002 to Oct. 2002, nurses adapted patient sedation according to the Harris score with the same drugs. Third phase: from Jan.RESULTS:After secondary exclusion of dead, tracheostomised and \"DNR\" order patients.CONCLUSION:The use of a protocolized adjustment of sedation drugs by the nurses in MV patients decreased depth of sedation with a non significant decrease in MV duration and LOS. Use of short half-life hypnotic drug as Propofol did not improve these results.INTRODUCTION:Redo valve surgery remains a surgical and an intensive care challenge.

Therefore it is frequently administered in severe respiratory tract infections. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is an important extracorporal renal replacement therapy in intensive care patients suffering from sepsis and multiple organ failure. No dosage recommendation for intravenous moxifloxacin is available for patients undergoing renal replacement therapy.METHODS:Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in nine intensive-care patients with acute renal failure and suspected or proven infection sensitive to moxifloxacin who received moxifloxacin 400 mg intravenously once daily. The concentration of moxifloxacin in serum and ultradiafiltrate was determined by HPLC.CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin\u00b4s pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with acute renal failure undergoing CVVHDF is comparable to healthy subjects and patients without renal impairment. We recommend 400 mg of moxifloxacin i.v. once per day in anuric patients during CVVHDF.",

We tried to identify factors predicting ARF in our patientsMETHODS:We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a polyvalent intensive care unit between 1999-January and 2003 December. We classified acute renal failure as moderate, if creatinine >1.5 mg/dL and as severe ARF if creatinine >2 mg/dL. We studied demographic and clinical variables as potential risk factors like age, sex, prior hypertension arterial, COPD, diabetes mellitus and alcoholism. We also evaluated perioperative factors: left ventricular ejection fraction, type of technique, intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) prior or after surgery and surgery timings (extracorporeal circuit time, aortic clamping time), flow of the extracorporeal pump and perioperative aminas use. Statistical analysis was made with the Students t-test and variables were contrasted by chi-square or Fisher's exact test.RESULTS:We collected 1139 patients, 59.3% were men and 40.7% women. A total of 131 (11.5 %) of them develop moderate (ARF) and 52 (4.6%) presented severe ARF with a total mortality of 3.5%. Diabetes mellitus was present in 20.5%, 5.5% were habitual drinkers, 9.1% had COPD and 45.6% presented hypertension. None of them was independent predictor factor for the development of ARF. According to the type of surgery, 50% underwent valvular prothesis, 37.7% coronary artery bypass, 6.8% mix technique and 5.5% other forms of cardiac surgery. We found that longer extracorporeal timing was associated with moderate ARF (137.51 min vs. 112.21 min; p = 0.007), but not with severe ARF (150.15 vs. 113.45; p=0.091). Prolonged aortic clamping time was also associated with moderate ARF (86.93 vs. 74.86; p=0.001) but not with severe ARF (81.06 vs. 76.02; p=0.264)",

Therefore, the Ascites Club criteria of HRS include the infusion of 1500ml isotonic saline.

Mortality increased with the presence of an increasing number of modified Glasgow criteria, however a number of individual physiological measurements and the APACHE II score had better discrimination for predicting hospital mortality as measured by the area under the ROC curve. The individual variables giving the best discrimination were highest serum creatinine, lowest pH and highest serum urea.CONCLUSION: Several physiological variables were found to have a very strong univariate relationship with hospital mortality in admissions with pancreatitis. Some of these had discriminatory ability exceeding that of the seven identifiable modified Glasgow criteria. There is scope for developing an objectively weighted multivariate prognostic model from these data.REFERENCE(S): (1) Blamey SL, Imrie CW et al.

Death probability calculated using APACHE II score better reflects our actual mortality. Lower mortality in group C reflects significantly lower severity of illness. The observation that ward patients admitted to the ICU have worst outcomes 1 is not confirmed in our hospital may be due to early identification of patients at risk and the application of effective therapeutic measures before ICU admission.REFERENCE(S): 1.

However, information on the course of these patients is still limited. Aim of this retrospective observational analysis was to determine outcome and prognostic factors in this cohort. METHODS: We abstracted data from our ICU database of all patients admitted \u2265 30 days to our mixed-ICU at a tertiary, university hospital, from March 1998 to December 2003. RESULTS: 137 patients (age 64, IQR 58-71 ys; SAPS II score 54, IQR 41-65; length of stay 39, range 30-150 days; 100 [73%] medical-cardiologic and 37 [27%] cardiac-surgical patients; 9.5% of all admissions, ICU mortality 21.2%) were included in this study. Hospital mortality was significantly higher in long term vs. short term (\u2264 30 days) patients (35.8% vs. 22.1%, p = 0.001).Factors associated with in-hospital mortality at univariate analysis were male gender (male vs. When entering all these factors in a multiple regression analysis model only renal replacement therapy, length of mechanical ventilation and fewer days with enteral nutrition revealed to be independent prognostic factors for in hospital death (OR = 1.CONCLUSION:Hospital mortality in long term ICU patients is high. Nevertheless a considerable proportion of patients with a prolonged length of stay in the ICU survive their critical illness. Hospital mortality is associated with renal replacement therapy during the ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation and fewer days with enteral nutrition.",

It includes the pre-hospital emergencies system and an university high technology hospital. Inclusion standards: sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), 14 and 65 years old for organ donation and until 70 years old for tissues, period between SCA and ALS\u00a330min, no effective heart-beating after 30min-ALS (according to ECR guidelines). Patients with biological risk, unclear and violent death, haemodynamic instability over 60mins and with technical difficulties are excluded. A telephone call to the Transplant Procurement Manager actives the hospital protocol. During the move ALS are doing. At the arrival, the patient is situated into emergency room and they start mechanic ventilation and Cardiopump HCM 100 for extern chest compression. Surgeon begins the A-V dissection to canalise them and start abdominal organs normothermic re-circulation until the extraction surgery. Meantime, it's obtained the familiar and judicial consent. If it's accepted, the organs extraction is begun. The limit time for hot ischaemia (period between SCA and normothermic re-circulation) is 120min.RESULTS: 26 activations have been done. 25 have been accepted for tissue's donors and 18 for organ's donors. All of them have been male with a medium age 41\u00b116.5 years-old. 7 patients had traumatic disease and 11 medic disease. The medium time between SCA-ALS were 10\u00b19.3min and the hot ischaemia's time were 97\u00b143min. There were 5(20%) familiar refusals, 1 judicial refusal, 1 patient was rejected for biological risk. 18 kidneys and 11 livers were rejected because of the macroscopic appearance or perfusion defects. 8 kidneys and 2 livers have been transplanted. About tissues: 6 arterial, 6 cardiovascular, 11 osteo-tendinous, 22 cornea and 1 skin tissues have been extracted. 4 kidneys and 4 livers have been used by experimental medicine.CONCLUSION:The protocol running and the results during this first year are satisfactory. Trying to reduce the pre-hospital ACR time and the hot ischaemia's time is one of our objectives for the future. After the results founded, we conclude that it is necessary to improve the organ's macroscopic evaluation, because of our actual little experience.REFERENCE: 1.Cho YW et al, Transplantation of kidneys from donors whose hearts have stopped beating, NEJM 1998 Jan 22; 338(4): 221-5.IN-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST SYSTEM AUDITGomes E 1 , Ara\u00fajo R 1 , Carneiro A 1 Unidade de Cuidados Intensivos Polivalente UCIP, Hospital Geral de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Porto, Portugal",

Capillary glycemia is frequently used to monitor this treatment. The aim of this study was to compare capillary and serum glycemia in ICU patientsMETHODS:This prospective, multicentric, and descriptive study was conducted in six French medical ICUs: 3 university hospitals ICUs of 22, 18 and 27 beds; and 3 general hospitals ICUs of 10, 14 and 26 beds. All adult patients (>18 years old) admitted in ICU were included upon arrival. Demographic characteristics and severity scores were collected upon admission, clinical and biological data was assessed twice a day during the first 3 days. This study received the approval of the ethic committee of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de R\u00e9animation de Langue Fran\u00e7aise.RESULTS:Study period: between 09/01/2002 and 10/31/2002, 451 patients were eligible. The difference between capillary and laboratory serum glycemia measurements (DG) was statistically significant, but constant throughout the entire study period, with a DG>20% observed in 18.85% of cases. The subsequent statistical analysis were therefore performed using the data collected upon admission only. The mean DG was 0.38 +/-2.61 mmol/L (p=0.0026) with a DG>20% observed in 22.38% of cases. There were no observed differences between patients with a DG > or < to 20% in term of age, gender, body mass index, ICU length of stay, mean arterial pressure, cardiac frequency, and use of vasopressive agents. The table 1 shows the results of the univariate analysis comparing patients with a DG> or <20%. In multivariate analysis, only IGS II and the association 'Mottled limbs and acrocyanosis' remained significantly associated with a DG>20% (p=0.0016 and 0.01, respectively). When serum was used on the glucometer, the mean DG was reduced by 50%, with a significant difference between arterial vs venous samples (10,53% vs 20% of DG>20%, p=0.02). Results of the univariate analysis :CONCLUSION: Capillary glycemia appears poorly adapted to the monitoring of glycemia in 22.38% of patients upon admission, and particularly in the most severe patients with mottled limbs and acrocyanosis. The use of arterial sample with a glucometer gives a more reliable measure.",

In order to provide appropriate energy requirements the measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) is the preferred measure of energy balance. This is ideally assessed by indirect calorimetry. The most studied and validated method utilizes the metabolic cart . Recently, more compact, modular devices, and a device incorporated into the mechanical ventilator have been developed but only studied in small groups of patients.

HHC is suspected from premature development of atherosclerotic vessel diseases independent on lipid status. This fact was confirmed by many retrospective case control studies but conflicting results come from prospective studies. Supported by these findings we introduced the selective screening of total homocysteine (tHcy) in ICU patiens. Among 11 409 patients hospitalized in our hospital within last 10 yrs a relatively high frequency of HHCs have been observed. The aim of this paper is to follow HHC in ICU patiens.",

Transvesical measurement of the IAP is most popular, but it is labor intensive and may be prone to methodological errors. An alternative is to introduce an esophageal balloon (Compliance catheter female, International Medical Products BV, Zutphen, The Netherlands), connected to a pressure transducer, into the stomach. The pressure transducer can be connected to any monitoring equipment used in the unit. It is however not clear what medium, water or air, and what volume is necessary to have accurate readings.

We studied the placement of new nasal AODPs in 2 groups of awake patients: 1.Those referred to the nurse led outreach team, fulfilling predefined criteria for critical illness in whom knowledge of their cardiac output was clinically indicated. 2.Patients undergoing regional anaesthesia for elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. For each subject we recorded: 1.Ease of insertion graded by the operator following topical application of lidocaine to the naso-pharynx. 2.Time taken to focus the probe. 3.Tolerability of placement, graded using a visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-100, in the surgical group only and prior to any sedative drugs. This was not recorded in the outreach group as it was considered unreliable and inappropriate. 4.Any complications associated with insertion.RESULTS: 15 patients studied had a median age of 70 (range 36-84). 9 were in the outreach group and 6 in the theatre group.

RS, again needing catecholamines, packed red cells and massive volume substitution, developes a septic shock within days. In both patients graphicly displayed tonometry values can easily be correlated with clinical events.CONCLUSION: Different techniques for visualization of large data sets are widely used in information technology (4). 3-dimensional display of the frequency distribution of numerous measurements clarifies the information, which is not readibly identifiable considering the numeric results. Visual graphs allow a much easier, intuitional and more effective analysis of the data.

Laboratory blood glucose correlated well with glucometer blood glucose, r=0.684, p<0.001. In the assessment of agreement and bias, a mean difference of -0.219 mmol/L with a standard deviation of 0.613 mmol/L between glucometer and laboratory methods was observed. The 95% limits of agreement were -1.44 to 1.01 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: Initial assessment using the Correlation Coefficient reported an encouraging association between the glucometer and laboratory. However, calculation of agreement and its 95% limits indicate that a glucometer may not be as accurate as the laboratory analyser. There are established concerns regarding the accuracy of glucometers in the ICU and at the lower range of normal. High partial pressures of oxygen, haematocrit and pH all affect glucose measurement. These variables are common in the ICU. The benefit of tight glycaemic control is clear in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality. However accurate monitoring and control of blood glucose is essential. Laboratory analysis remains the most accurate and precise method. Future studies should include greater numbers of samples and examination into which point-of-care test would be most suitable for immediate analysis. ",
