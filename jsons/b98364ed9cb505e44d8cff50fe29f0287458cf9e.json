The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lockdown. Any strategy about the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range 20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of 57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the epidemic is not curtailed and localized. The uncertainty on single day projection in our analysis after April 15 is found to be within 5%. The reproduction number R 0 becomes less than unity after the peak or turning point of the outbreak. After the peak date, the infection rate will start decreasing but it might take months for the epidemic to completely fade away with 97% recovery happening in late August-to-September 2020.",

For example, the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is used to model the outbreak in the city of Wuhan China [1] . Analyses about Pakistan have been conducted but lack the reasonable estimates of the pandemic. The simplest version of the SIR model seems to be working better than other variants, in particular, the prediction made for China in [2] was found to be in agreement with the real data and hence used as a starting point. We followed a similar strategy to implement the time-dependent SIR model. Besides the fitting method in [2] , we checked the machine learning approach as documented in [3] but that method does not give superior results. The SIR model depends upon two tunable parameters \u03b2(t), that measures the transmissions per unit time and \u03b3(t) that measures the recoveries per unit time. The proper estimation of these parameters can predict a reasonable number of infections and the peak of the pandemic. The exponential fit is used to estimate their values from data and then predicting future trends.",

On physical ground, the parameter \u03b2(t) should be monotonically decreasing with time, otherwise, the pandemic will not stop unless all the susceptible population gets infected. The later case will be a very extreme situation, that has not been happening in the epidemics like SARS in 2003 and still not the case in COVID-19 in many countries such as China and Switzerland which are recovering and finishing the disease period. A second constraint on the parameter \u03b2(t) is that it should not be sharply decreasing otherwise the model will significantly underestimate the epidemic transmissibility. A good estimate for the parameter \u03b2(t) is found by fitting different subsets of data and constraining it by using the above mentioned criterions.",

For the validation purpose of our analysis procedures and tools, we have reproduced some of the predictions for Chinese pandemic (plots not shown) and performed analysis for Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Spain. For the last four countries a summary is given in Table 2 . The numbers agree reasonably well with the data for these countries, except the prediction of the peak date of the pandemic which is based on the distribution of active infected cases as shown in Figure 1 (a). The peak date of the pandemic is off (overestimated) by a week with respect to the peak position in the data for Switzerland. The reason for discrepancy could be due to the fixed value of \u03b3 being used in the model instead of the time dependent parametrization. Another method(plots not shown) which has been studied for predicting the peak of the pandemic, is by comparing the number of daily new infections with the SIR model. That distribution gives the peak of the pandemic to fall in the mid May but the method itself is very sensitive to the fluctuations in data. On the other hand the cumulative active infection distribution is not very sensitive to any fluctuations in data(which may arises due to changes in the testing capacity/strategies or sudden spikes in the number of infections) and is therefore used as baseline method in this analysis. To take the discrepancy into account, an uncertainty of one week is assigned to the peak date of the pandemic determined with the default method used in this paper. The distribution of active Infectives and cumulative Infectives as a function of time for Switzerland are shown in Figure 1 . There has been a very good agreement between the data points and the SIR model for a recovery rate of 0.047. The inflection point of peak of pandemic occurred around 8 April and the model predicts around 29909 cumulative Infective cases in Switzerland, which can be compared to the total cumulative infection of 29905 on 3rd May with almost flatten curve. The results validate our analysis procedure and give us confidence to accurately predict the pandemic scenarios for Pakistan.",

The cumulative infected cases in Pakistan on March 1st and 2nd were 4 and, therefore the infection rate \u03b2(t) is zero. On March 5, the cumulative Infective increased to 5 and, therefore, the infection rate \u03b2(t) jumps to 0.25. For the following two days, the number of Infective remains constant and thus \u03b2(t) is zero. The recovery rate \u03b3(t) remains zero for obvious reasons and for the first time jumps to 0.17 when one person recovers on March 8. The infection rate jumps sharply to 1.67 on March 10 when the number of cumulative Infective becomes almost triple the number of cases on the previous day. During the following days, \u03b2(t) drops sharply once again. On March 16, there is a spike in the number of Infectives which makes \u03b2(t) to rise sharply. Such a sudden rise in \u03b2(t) due to change in the number of Infectives could be attributed to sharp increase in the number of tests performed or testing a large group of people arriving from abroad. To estimate the time-dependent infection and recovery rates, we pass cumulative Infectives data per day as input to SIR model. The parameters \u03b2(t) and \u03b3(t) are estimated by using equations (6) and (7) . The values of \u03b2(t) and \u03b3(t) obtained are shown as red circles in Figure 2 (a) and green circles in Figure 2 A time-dependent parametrization of \u03b2(t) is obtained by performing exponential fits to the infection rate data as shown in Figure 2(a) . To find the best fit, several subsets of data are extracted by sequentially excluding the data between 1st March to 5th March in the one-day interval. The results of exponential fits for five subsets of data are shown in Figure 2 (a). All the fits are having negative slops which give rise to \u03b2(t) decreasing with time. The fits corresponding to subsets of data from 2nd March to 5th March are excluded due to rapidly falling slope, as they will underestimate the peak and cumulative infected cases, and the ending of the pandemic. For pandemic predictions and evolution in coming months, parametrization obtained based on the data set of 1st March, is passed to the SIR model as time dependent parametrization of \u03b2(t). The exponential fit corresponding to 1st March is shown as solid line in Figure 2(a) . The exponential function based on dataset starting from 1st March essentially includes all the data since the start of the pandemic in Pakistan when four infected cases were reported.",

            "text": "The variable \u03b3(t) is obtained from data by using equation (7) and plotted in Figure 2 (b). The parameter \u03b3(t) is a slow varying variable with average value of around 0.02. In this analysis different fixed values of \u03b3(t) are used instead of the time-dependent parameterizations to find an optimum window where accurate predictions can be made. For a range of recovery rates (different values of \u03b3(t)), a plot of active Infectives, which is defined as the difference of cumulative Infectives minus recovered cases, is shown in Figure 3(a) . The active infected cases agree reasonably well with the predicted SIR model distribution for a recovery rate of 0.043. The peak of the pandemic will occur at 29 May with active infected cases of around 20000. The peak Infectives exclude the number of cases who either recovered or died as they no more contribute to the transmission of infection. The modelling has been done based on the current data which corresponds to the strict lock-down scenario. Any change in the lock-down and social distancing scenarios could rapidly escalate the infected cases which will shift the peak of Infectives accordingly. Therefore the prediction has to be made in a window of models for different recovery rates. For recovery rates from 0.043 to 0.034, the peak of the pandemic will occur between 29 May and 9 June, 2020. Comparison of data with predictions and the trend of active infection rate don't support models with \u03b3(t) larger than 0.049. Those models will significantly underestimate the cumulative number of Infectives and hence excluded from the discussion here. The cumulative Infective cases as a function of time are shown in Figure 3 (b). The figure shows that the cumulative curves will start flattening in June-July. For a change of 0.003 in the recovery rate there is a significant change in the total number of cumulative Infectives as well as flattening of the curves. This suggests that better health care and recovery rates can significantly reduce the total number of infected people and can shorten the duration of the pandemic. The total number of infected cases could be 57651 for a recovery rate of 0.046 and can rise to 153149 for a recovery rate of 0.034. The total number of Infectives can easily cross a figure of 100,000 if the recovery gets worsen. The cumulative infections for upper and lower bounds are summarized in Table 3 . A comparison of the data and model prediction is zoomed-in in Figure 4 (a). The disagreement between 15 March and 10 April could be attributed to the change in health care strategies such as improving patients testing capabilities. Through enforcing rigorous countrywide lock-down, the active infection rate stabilizes after 10 April. The percentage error on the number of Infective per day is shown in Figure 4 (b). Apart from some outliers, the error on one-day prediction lies within 5% uncertainty band, which is shown as shaded region in the figure. To cross-check the turning point or peak position of the model, a variable known as reproduction number is defined as the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate. The plot of reproduction number R 0 as a function of time is shown in Figure 5 . The solid horizontal line shows the turning point when the recovery rate will dominate the infection rate. At this point, the pandemic will turn around as more people will recover than infected and this also marks the peak position in the SIR model. For different recovery rates the models cross the horizontal line in the time window from late May to 9th June, which marks the turning point of the pandemic. The reproduction number R 0 becomes less than unity after the peak or turning point of the outbreak and the pandemic is expected to fade away with 97% of the recovery already happened by August-September 2020.",

            "text": "The modelling and prediction of COVID-19 for Pakistan have been presented by using a simple time dependent SIR model. The two input parameters namely the infection rate \u03b2(t) and recovery rate \u03b3(t) are estimated from data using equations (6) and (7). A time-dependent parametrization of \u03b2(t) is obtained by performing exponential fit to the data. The analysis has been validated by predicting the pandemic peak and cumulative Infectives of Switzerland and other European countries. The cumulative Infectives for Switzerland are predicted to be around 29909 when the curves will flatten in the first half of May. This prediction is in good agreement with the total Infectives of 29905 on 3rd May. The analysis is then performed to predict the pandemic scenario in Pakistan. A comparison of active infection rate for data and models are made for different values of recovery rate \u03b3(t). The best match occurs for the model with a recovery rate of 0.043 for unrecovered peak Infectives of 20094, which is expected to happen on 29 May(with uncertainty of a week on the peak date). Based on a window of recovery rate \u03b3(t), the prediction interval of turning or peak point of the pandemic is expected to occur from late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives from 20000-47000. The cumulative number of Infectives in the existing lock-down scenario is predicted to be in the range 57651-153100. These numbers are very sensitive to both transmission and recovery rates. For example, a 1% reduction in the recovery rate will triple the number of cumulative infected people. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end under the strict preventive scenario and can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the epidemic is not contained through strict measures. To keep the cumulative Infectives around 60000 and to get rid of the pandemic by August-September, it is proposed to keep strict preventive measures intact till mid-June, 2020. The turning point of the pandemic is also modelled with the reproduction number R 0 which predicts the same time window as given by the SIR model. The reproduction number R 0 becomes less than unity after the peak of the active Infective distribution. The pandemic is expected to fade away completely with 97% Infectives recovered by August-September.",
