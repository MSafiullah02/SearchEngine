Non-urban GPs were significantly more likely to rate the response of their practice to a pandemic as likely to be poor (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.03-8.76) and were less likely to be aware of pandemic preparedness plans (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.39-0.99).

However, only one-quarter of GPs in this survey felt they would be able to respond adequately to a pandemic event. While it is uncertain when the next influenza pandemic might occur, a widely held view is that it is becoming increasingly likely. If GPs are to successfully integrate proactive pandemic preparedness activities with their regular activities, it is important to obtain their views, identify their needs and understand their perspectives regarding pandemic preparedness. The results of this survey provide some insight into the current state of perceived pandemic preparedness among a cohort of GPs in one part of the United Kingdom. Internationally, support for our results is provided by studies examining GPs' views regarding their role and practice preparedness in responding to public health emergencies in general including SARS and other biothreats such as pandemic influenza [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

This may reflect urban advantage in relation to pandemic influenza training provision or access to information, advice and support. Indeed, although the DH guidance effectively delegates responsibility for preparedness to the local level, to date there has been little discussion of the needs of GPs based in different geographic locations. This study clearly shows that this gap needs to be addressed. The DH guidance also indicates that national healthcare capacity will be strengthened in the event of an influenza pandemic [3] . However, survey respondents believed that the primary care workforce would be overwhelmed and expressed concern at the potential lack of excess capacity in the healthcare system.

In this survey, respondents lacked confidence in the ability of the healthcare system to provide an effective response due to lack of clear guidance, insufficient resources and inadequate capacity. In particular, concerns were expressed regarding pressures on hospitals, surge capacity and effective communication to both patients and healthcare professionals. Only 25% of GPs felt that their practices were prepared to respond effectively in the event of an influenza pandemic. This is consistent with the 17-23% found in studies reporting self-perceived preparedness of GPs to respond to public health emergencies [4] [5] [6] . A previous survey found that 20% of public health workers felt confident that they could effectively communicate pandemic risks to the general public [9] . In this study 14% of respondents were confident that they could explain to their patients what to do and why in the event of an influenza pandemic, which suggests a need for risk communication training.

The response rate of 54% is comparable to that obtained from other GP questionnaire surveys (30%-63%) focusing on preparedness for public health emergencies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, response bias may have occurred as news media reports may have prompted a response from those who were concerned about pandemic influenza. Indeed, it is recognised that news media serve as a major source of information for physicians and can influence physician behaviour [11] [12] [13] . The remarkable increase in questionnaires received following the reminder in January provides evidence to support these roles as there appears to be a temporal association between the increased return of questionnaires and news media reporting of the first cases of human avian influenza outside Asia [14, 15] .
