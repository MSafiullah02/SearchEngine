Its action against tapeworm species is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, block glucose uptake, and inhibit respiration in anaerobic ATP production [3], [4]. Niclosamide is a US Food and Drug Administration approved compound that has been used in humans for 40 years [5]. It is commercially known as Bayer 73 in Germany or bayluscide or niclocide in Canada and the United States [6], [7]. It is well tolerated by rats with an acute oral toxicity. A significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs when niclosamide is given to male and female rats at a concentration of 5 g/kg/day for four weeks [6], [7], [8]. Niclosamide is effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [9]. It also has antineoplastic activity and anti-anthrax toxin properties [10], [11]. Niclosamide induces LC3-positive autophagosomes and inhibits the Wnt/Frizzled pathway and mTOR signaling [12], [13], [14].",

Thermodynamic parameters are especially helpful in identifying the binding mechanism of a drug to any protein. Serum proteins are the major transport protein in human body. Albumin is a serum protein widely used to explain the binding mechanism of a small molecule to a protein. Serum proteins are capable of reversibly binding many endogenous and exogenous drugs [15], [16]. They may aid in selective delivery of the drugs to a target tissue, organ, or tumor region, thus delivering drugs into the cell. Most recently, a large number of studies on the drug\u2013protein interaction have been reported using techniques including fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichoism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. It is necessary to determine binding parameters during destabilization by these methods for drug\u2013protein systems.",

The spectral changes of all proteins on synchronous fluorescence upon the addition of niclosamide are shown in Fig. 3\n. The maximum emission peaks of tyrosine residues (\u0394\u03bb = 15 nm) and tryptophan residues (\u0394\u03bb = 60 nm) exhibited a slight shift for all proteins. As Fig. 4\nA and C shows, however, it is obvious that the pitch of quenching at \u0394\u03bb 60 nm is higher than that at \u0394\u03bb 15 nm for HSA and globulin, indicating that niclosamide is closer to tryptophan residues than tyrosine residues. This means that the binding sites of the drug are more prevalent on the tryptophan moiety. For hemoglobin, at a low concentration of the drug the pitch of quenching at \u0394\u03bb 15 nm is higher than that at \u0394\u03bb 60 nm, whereas it is lower than that of \u0394\u03bb 60 nm at a high concentration of niclosamide (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the polarity of the surrounding environment depends on the concentration of the drug. Both the tyrosine and tryptophan moieties exert an effect on the binding mechanism of hemoglobin.",

The fluorescence intensity of HSA was enhanced and the emission band slightly blue shifted as a result of increasing protein concentration at a certain amount of niclosamide. This suggests that the polarity of the microenvironment of niclosamide decreased, which means that niclosamide entered the hydrophobic microenvironment of HSA. A good linear response of fluorescence intensity was also obtained as a function of HSA concentration. The linear equation was y = 707.06x + 18.233 (R = 0.992) for HSA whereas the concentration of HSA ranged from 17.5 \u03bcg to 2.5 \u03bcg. Niclosamide also enhanced the emission band with a slight blue shift when the amounts of hemoglobin and globulin were increased. This means that the polarity of the microenvironment of niclosamide also increased for both proteins. The results suggest that niclosamide interacted with the hydrophobic sides of the proteins. The interaction of niclosamide with both hemoglobin and globulin thus occurred. The linear equation was y = 96.649x + 47.381 (R = 0.995) for hemoglobin whereas it was y = 457.24x + 68.347 (R = 0.996) for globulin at a concentration range of 17.5 \u20132.5 \u03bcg.",

The relationship between acting force and thermodynamic parameters was described by Ross and Subramanian [29] as follows: (1) \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S < 0 indicates van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds; (2) \u0394H < 0 and \u0394S > 0 indicates electrostatic interactions; and (3) \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0 indicates hydrophobic forces. The values of the enthalpy change (\u0394H) and the entropy change (\u0394S) can be measured from the following equations:[3]LnKb=\u2212\u0394H/RT+\u0394S/R\n[4]\u0394G=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394Swhere K\nb is the binding constant at the different temperatures, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. van't Hoff plots between log K\nb and 1/T were used to estimate the values of enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S) change. The values of \u0394H and \u0394S were determined to be \u22121.71 kJ mol\u22121 and \u22122.81 J mol\u22121 K for HSA, respectively (Table 2\n). The binding of niclosamide to HSA is carried out by both van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonding, which involve negative values of \u0394H and \u0394S. These values were found to be \u22122.03 kJ mol\u22121 and \u22126.15 J mol\u22121 K\u22121 for hemoglobin, whereas they were estimated as 3.39 kJ mol\u22121 K\u22121 and 12.05 J mol\u22121 K\u22121 for globulin, respectively. The values of \u0394H and \u0394S were also negative at the experimental temperature, indicating that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds play major roles in the binding process for hemoglobin. The positive values of \u0394H and \u0394S for globulin suggest a hydrophobic interaction.

The values of \u0394G were negative at all experimental temperatures, indicating that the reaction was spontaneous for HSA and hemoglobin. Positive values of \u0394G at 296 K (6.96 kJ mol\u22121), 299 K (6.99 kJ mol\u22121), and 302 K (7.03 kJ mol\u22121) show that globulin binding was energy dependent.",

The emission of each protein decreased with the addition of niclosamide to the protein solution, leading to an energy transfer between drug and protein molecules. Static quenching is the main mechanism through which all proteins quenched. Thermodynamic parameters suggested that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are the forces behind niclosamide's interactions with HSA and hemoglobin. The interaction of niclosamide with globulin, by contrast, is carried out via hydrophobic interaction. These results show that the binding mechanism of the drug to each protein depends on the protein's structure.",
