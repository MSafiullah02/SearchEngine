            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARS-CoV [1], [2]. The SARS-CoV genome consists of approximately 29,000 bp and encodes four main structure proteins including spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Among them spike protein is responsible for binding to specific receptor on the susceptible cells. Additionally, the gene sequence of the spike protein is comparably constant [2], [3]. It has been reported that patients infected with SARS-CoV had high levels of antibodies in sera. These antibodies could inhibit the infection of cells with pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing SARS-CoV S protein and be used to treat SARS-CoV-infected patients [4], [5], [6], [7]. Recently, several reports including ours have demonstrated that SARS-CoV S specific memory CD8+ T cells were generated and maintained in vivo in the patients with fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection [8], [9], [10]. These data indicate that the spike protein is a good target for the vaccine to generate immune responses against the SARS-CoV infection. In animal studies, a number of increasing evidence demonstrated that immunization of animals with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine lead to the generation of long-term neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies are effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication in lungs when mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine were then challenged with SARS-CoV [5], [11]. Although it has been reported that CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV S protein in animals are generated after SARS-CoV S DNA vaccination, it remains unclear whether CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are able to become memory cells. In this regard, our study was mainly focused on determining SARS-CoV S specific effector/memory T cell responses after mice are immunized i.m. with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine. Our results demonstrate that immunization of mice with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine results in the generation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. These CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are persisted for over a long period of time with a phenotype of memory cells. These data provide important information in animal models for analyzing antigen-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and rational design effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection based on SARS S protein since it is not known whether SARS-CoV reoccurs and infects humans through animal reservoirs.",

Immunization of mice by i.m. injection elicited the highest frequency of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 expression of CD8+ T cells in lung than in lymph nodes and spleen.

            "text": "It has been reported that DNA vaccination is a practical and effective way to induce humoral and cellular immune responses and has shown great promise for protective immune responses against several diseases in experimental animal models including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria [15], [16], [17]. In the present study, we have demonstrated that prime\u2013boost immunization of mice with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine induces antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. The cellular immune responses are mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell. Functional study indicates that antigen-specific cells produced cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after short stimulation in vitro with a pool of SARS-S peptides. IFN-\u03b3 is an effector cytokine that is able to activate macrophage cells and inhibit viral replication [18], and IL-2 is a growth factor that probably maintains memory cells and mediates expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [19]. Based on IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 expression, memory T cells are able to divide into three subpopulations including IFN-\u03b3+, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2+, IL-2+ cells, indicating that memory T cells are composed of distinct functional subsets. Phenotype analysis indicates that SARS-CoV S specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are CD62L\u2212. Some of the memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells express IL-7R\u03b1. These populations of the cells may have the potential differentiate into long-term memory cells [14]. It has been reported that IL-7 is mainly secreted by the stromal cells and plays a key role in sustaining the homeostasis of memory CD8+ T-cell in vivo [20], [21]. In line with other studies, we also find most of the memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were identified in non-lymphoid tissues (lungs) in which these memory T cells are called effector memory cells [22], [23]. Thus, by their location, effector memory T cells can respond rapidly when re-exposed to a pathogen and may play the most important role in the defence when re-encountering a pathogen. Furthermore, the function of non-lymphoid effector memory cells has been demonstrated in a study in which Sendai virus specific memory CD4+ T cells persist in the lungs, and transfer of these cells into \u03b22-microglobulin-dificient mice confers a significant level of protection against re-infection [24]. Consistent with our observations, several reports demonstrate that natural infection in humans induces memory CD8+ T cells responses [10]. Moreover, immunization of mice with adno-vector encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV S protein generates two H-2b-restricted epitopes and one H-2d-restricted epitopes of CD8+ T cells [25]. In addition, Yang et al., reported that vaccination of mice with SARS-CoV S DNA generated cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. The neutralizing antibody can inhibit SARS-CoV replication and results in protective immunity in a murine challenge model. In adoptive transfer study, they found that antibodies but not T cells play a critical role in protection against SARS-CoV challenge [5]. Thus, it is still unclear whether T cells may play a role in the generation of protective immune responses. We assume that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells reveal a direct killing of virus-infected cells and CD4+ T cells may provide help for antibody isotype switching and generation of memory B cells and memory CD8+ T cells [23], [26]. In support of our expectation, other studies of animal coronavirus have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to protection during persistent infection [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].",
