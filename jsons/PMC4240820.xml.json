Ten studies used cross-correlation function to measure the similarity of two curves and to determine the time lag at which the correlation between the datasets is maximized. Cross-correlation is a standard method to determine the time delay between two signals. In three studies, only correlation between the time series was examined without analyzing time-lagged relationship. Six studies used aberration detection methods to evaluate whether and by how long the date of signal detection by drug sales precedes the signal based on diagnostic data. The signal definition for aberration detection was based on either a simple threshold to define alerts [15] or more complex algorithms such as the Serfling method [14], ARIMA models [19], the simple moving average method (MA), the cumulative sum method (CUSUM) [11],[16], or the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) [18]. These studies assessed the performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of disease outbreak detection. Five other studies [13],[24]-[26],[29] only evaluated whether drug sales showed a significant increase during a known epidemic period.",

Only two studies didn\u2019t found any consistent correlation. For example, Das et al. [14] found a poor correlation between OTC antidiarrheal drug sales and emergency department visits for diarrhea in New York City, with an r2 of 0.24. They found however an increase in sales during a known outbreak of norovirus. OTC drug sales preceded clinical data in three of eight studies that analyzed timeline correlations [18],[20],[21]. For example, in Hogan et al. [18], the correlation coefficient between electrolyte sales and hospital diagnoses of respiratory and diarrheal illness was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93) when drug sales were assumed to precede clinical diagnosis data by 1.7 weeks. Outbreaks were detected with 100% sensitivity and specificity in 3 of 5 studies that analyzed signal detection [15],[16],[18]. Drug sales data provided an earlier outbreak signal in two of them [15],[18]. In Davies et al. [15], the rate of cough/cold sales exceeded a threshold of 1000 units per week two weeks before the peak in emergency department admissions during three consecutive winters. In Hogan et al. [18], detection from electrolytes sales occurred an average 2,4 weeks earlier than detection from hospital diagnoses of respiratory and diarrheal diseases.",

They illustrate the need for improved surveillance systems, evidenced by recent public health crises (e.g., anthrax in 2001, the SARS outbreak in 2003, the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, etc.). Drug sales data present indeed many advantages in terms of public health surveillance. Data can be obtained in a real-time manner and usually cover a large portion of the population.
