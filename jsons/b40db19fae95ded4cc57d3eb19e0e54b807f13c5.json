It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans. The source of origin, transmission to humans, and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet clear, however, its resemblance to SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing-related studies. The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infections. In this review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.",

Delays in testing result from the need for administrative oversight of testing at the national or regional level, as well as the time needed to transport specimens and the high volume of testing needed in some regions. More rapid testing should be widely available in the event of epidemics. High-level testing facilities at regional hospitals and commercial laboratories are needed, in addition to the commercially available tests that have undergone regulatory approval. Several tests have been validated by public health authorities, including those in China, Germany, Thailand, Japan, and the United States (WHO, COVID-19, technical guidance, Feb 12, 2020) . These tests are reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests that use primers and probes designed to detect a variety of targets in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although these have been designed and validated, there is currently very limited information available related to the performance of these tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests are not widely known, and some of them might detect other related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV. In addition, the utility of different specimen types for detection of the viruses is not known. As a result, testing of multiple specimen types is recommended by some agencies, including the CDC (42) . The availability of serological tests is unclear and, presumably, such tests are in development. Moreover, the collection and submission of sera from potentially infected patients is recommended by some public health laboratories.",

Remdesivir and chloroquine were found highly effective in vitro for the control of 2019-nCoV infection (44) . Treatment with remdesivir alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta was found effective against COVID-19 infection. This strategy has not caused any obvious side effects yet (35, 44, 45) . However, more investigations are necessary to confirm the impacts of remdesivir. As coronaviruses share key genomic elements, common therapeutic targets are likely to be of greater importance. Therapeutic agents targeting nucleosides, nucleotides, viral nucleic acids, and enzymes/proteins involved in the replication and transcription of coronaviruses can be promising strategies to treat coronavirus diseases (Table 1 ) (1). The surface spike glycoprotein (S) is an important potential target for antiviral agents, due to its vital role in the interaction between the virus and the cell receptor. S consists of two subunits: S1, the amino-terminal receptor binding subunit, and S2, the carboxy-terminal membrane fusion subunit (46) . In addition, activation of membrane fusion and virus entry requires the cleavage at the junction of S1-S2 (46) . Hence, S1 subunit-targeting monoclonal antibodies and S2 subunit-targeting fusion inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents for coronaviruses (1). Furin (a serine endoprotease) cleaves off S1/S2 (47) could thus be a suitable antiviral agent. Further, the helical nucleocapsid interacts with S protein, envelope proteins, and membrane proteins to form the assembled virion (1). Therefore, targeting the structural genes using small interfering RNAs could be an effective therapeutic strategy against coronaviruses (1). The host receptors are also associated with the viral ",

            "text": "Inhibits kinase signaling associated pathways to block viral entry (1) entry into host cells, thus agents targeting these receptors also inhibit coronaviruses (46) . Inhibitors of endosomal cysteine protease and transmembrane protease serine 2 can partially block viral entry into the cell (48) . K22 targets membrane-bound RNA synthesis in coronaviruses and inhibits double-membrane vesicle formation (49) , and thus could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as dsRNA-activated caspase oligomerizer (DRACO), which selectively induces apoptosis in virus-containing host cells, provide another class to evaluate for effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 (50). However, this class does not provide a promising strategy alone, as they cannot block virus entry or disrupt viral nucleic acid. In contrast, thiopurine compounds, naphthalene inhibitors, protease inhibitors, zinc, and mercury conjugates target 3CLpro (3C-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease) enzymes in coronaviruses and have been shown to block their pathogenicity (51, 52) . Therefore, combinational therapy of these antiviral agents with DRACO may enhance the overall impact on the recovery of patients. Despite the higher rate of infectiousness, coronaviruses are thought to have the ability to suppress counteracting responses from host innate interferons. This response can be augmented by the utilization of interferon inducers or recombinant interferons (1) . Recombinant interferons such as interferon alpha and interferon beta that have been tested against SARS-CoV (1) might be utilized either alone or in combination with other potential antiviral drugs, including remdesivir. Both interferon alpha and beta inhibit viral replication (1) . The use of interferon inducers in combination with effective antiviral agents is worth evaluating for possible synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine (53) , in combination with antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines, could also be evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

Although SARS-CoV was fully controlled during 2003, and MERS-CoV has been prevented from causing high mortality rates, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is spreading efficiently with a significant increase in the number of cases and fatalities during each passing day. Vaccines are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from causing COVID-19. Live-attenuated vaccines, such as has been designed for SARS (1), may be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In addition rhesus -defensin 1 and protein cage nanoparticles are innate immunomodulators with high anti-SARS-CoV efficiency (54, 55) . Based on the high similarity and phylogenetic relatedness between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, protein cage nanoparticles designed for SARS-CoV can be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, following similar strategies utilized for SARS-CoV, novel protein cage nanoparticles specified for novel coronavirus can be designed on an emergency basis. Given the urgency in the current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak, vaccination strategies based on viral vectors, recombinant protein, and viral-like particles, which have been developed or are being developed for SARS and/or MERS, could be modified for utilization against SARS-CoV-2 (56) . Despite the current progress, further work is needed to develop safe and effective vaccines, available for individuals at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 endemics, to control the ongoing and risk of future epidemics. Further, an interesting feature of plasma from recovered patients is the presence of active antibodies. The transfer of plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 into infected individuals might enhance immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibodies that could inhibit virus-cell receptor binding and interrupt virus-cell fusion have been developed (1) . Combining two or more monoclonal antibodies may be suitable for the quicker recovery of patients. Lastly, antiviral peptides that target different regions of S, such as HP2P-M2 peptide (effective against viral infections) (1), should also be considered against COVID-19.",

Similarly, MERS-CoV became epidemic after a series of human infections in 2012 in Middle Eastern countries (33) . Both viruses transferred to several countries beyond the countries of origin. However, unlike the continuous propagation of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the SARS-CoV outbreak was successfully controlled in 2003.

The currently established models are not very promising for the studies of pathogenesis and treatment of highly pathogenic coronaviruses. For instance, nonhuman primates were unable to reproduce the characteristics of the severe human disease and mortality was not observed (57) . However, some small animals have developed clinical symptoms of disease (57) , such as transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains are one of the most suitable models (1). Additionally, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are a suitable small animal model for MERS (1) . Like the animal models for SARS-CoV, transgenic animal models may also be standardized for SARS-CoV-2. The development of clinical drugs for coronaviruses is challenging because of the repeated emergence of novel coronaviruses with diverse features, thus requiring specific drugs for each newly emerged virus. Moreover, only a limited number of animal models are available and most of them can only be used in highly demanding biosafety level 3 labs (1). From the perspective of the current outbreak, designing effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 is yet another challenge for scientists. Although a large number of antiviral treatment options for SARS and MERS have been reported with potent in vitro activities, a very limited number of these may have potential in the clinical setting.",
