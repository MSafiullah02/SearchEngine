Coronavirinae has been classified into alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronavirus (Su et al., 2016). Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to alphacoronavirus, which includes porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and canine coronavirus (CCoV). FCoV has been classified into two biotypes: weakly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; avirulent FCoV) and strongly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; virulent FCoV) (Pedersen NC, 2009). Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. In some cats, pleural effusion and ascitic fluid accumulated (Pedersen NC, 2009). The FCoV virion is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins (Tekes and Thiel, 2016). FECV and FIPV are classified into 2 serotypes, type I and II FCoV, based on differences in the amino acid sequence of S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Interferon (IFN) is a cytokine that induces an antiviral state in cells and influences via host cells (Coccia and Battistini, 2015). IFN is divided into type I, II, and III IFN. Type I IFN is an antiviral factor produced in response to viral infection. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 of type I IFN is produced by several cell types and plays an important role in the early defense mechanism against viral infection. For viruses to replicate in cells, inhibition of the antiviral action of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 (type I IFN response) is necessary. The mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN response by IFN\u03b2 has been closely investigated in several viruses. For example, in TGEV, PEDV, murine hepatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, it has been reported that structural proteins, excluding non-structural proteins and spike protein, inhibit IFN\u03b2 production (Case et al., 2018, 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2011; Lui et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016).

Thus, type II CCoV-derived genes recombined into type II FCoV may be involved in strong inhibition of IFN\u03b2 production by type II FCoV compared with that by type I FIPV. Of the genes in the recombined region, nsp14 (exonuclease), nsp15 (endoribonuclease), and nsp16 (2\u2032-0-methyltransferase) present in the ORF1b of other coronaviruses have been reported to inhibit IFN\u03b2 gene expression (Case et al., 2016; Coccia and Battistini, 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Menachery et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016), and these nsps are considered to prevent recognition of viral RNA by host PRR.

These findings and our results suggest that nsp14, 15, and 16 also suppress IFN\u03b2 production by type I FIPVs.

Indeed, the virus titer in the culture supernatant of type I FIPV UCD-1-infected cells was lower than that in the culture supernatants of cells infected with the other type I FIPV strains. In addition, in an experiment in which cells were inoculated with type I FIPV UCD-1 at a high infectivity titer, the IFN\u03b2 gene was induced to a level similar to that induced by type I FIPV KU-2. However, type I FIPV UCD-4 with a replicability level similar to that of type I FIPV UCD-1 strongly induced IFN\u03b2 expression.
