The assessment of disclosed relationships for possible COI is based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (i.e., monetary amount) and the relevance of the relationship (i.e., the degree to which an association might reasonably be interpreted by an independent observer as related to the topic or recommendation of consideration).

A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and research needs can be found online in the full text. In brief, per GRADE methodology, recommendations are labeled M a n u s c r i p t as \"strong\" or \"conditional\". The word \"recommend\" indicates strong recommendations and \"suggest\" indicates conditional recommendations. In situations where promising interventions were judged to have insufficient evidence of benefit to support their use and with potential appreciable harms or costs, the expert panel recommended their use in the context of a clinical trial. The guideline panel used the word \"only\" in recommendations about therapeutic agents with higher uncertainty and/or more potential for harm. These recommendations acknowledge the current \"knowledge gap\" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations for potentially ineffective or harmful interventions. The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19. The panel determined that when an explicit trade-off between the highly uncertain benefits and the known putative harms of these therapeutic agents were considered, a net positive benefit was not reached and could possibly be negative (risk of excess harm). The panel acknowledges that enrolling patients in RCTs might not be feasible for many frontline providers due to limited access and infrastructure. Should lack of access to clinical trials exist, we encourage setting up local or collaborative registries to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs to contribute to the knowledge base. Each clinician can play a role in advancing our understanding of this disease through a local registry or other data collection efforts. M a n u s c r i p t Background The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported from Wuhan, China in early December 2019 [1] , now known to be caused by a novel beta-coronavirus, named as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within a span of months COVID 19 has become pandemic due to its transmissibility, spreading across continents with the number of cases and deaths rising daily [2] . Although most infected individuals exhibit a mild illness (80%+), 14% have serious and 5% have critical illness. Approximately 10% will require hospital admission due to COVID-19 pneumonia, of which approximately 10% will require ICU care, including invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3] . While mortality appears to be more common in older individuals and those with comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes, young people with no comorbidities also appear to be at risk for critical illness including multi-organ failure and death.",

Two additional guidelines on diagnostic testing and infection prevention are also under development. These guidelines will be frequently updated as substantive literature becomes available and will be accessible on an easy to navigate web and device interface at http://www.idsociety.org/covid19guidelines. The guideline panel considered making a recommendation for therapeutic agents that were currently available for use. The panel chose not to give a recommendation for remdesivir as it is mostly available in the context of ongoing trials with limited availability for compassionate use and expanded access use. We anticipate data from RCTs for remdesivir will be soon available; at that point, we will update the guidelines to provide formal recommendations on its use.",

Within GRADE, the body of evidence across each outcome is assessed for domains that may reduce or increase one's certainty in the evidence. Factors that may reduce one's certainty include risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity across study findings), indirectness (applicability or generalizability to the research question), imprecision (the confidence in the estimate of an effect to support a particular decision) or publication bias (selective publication of studies).

The observed risk of mortality among patients receiving HCQ+AZ during hospital stay was 3.4% (6/175 patients). However, an estimated mortality rate in an untreated cohort was not provided in the manuscript. When compared to a lack of viral clearance in historical controls (100% virologic failure), 12 symptomatic patients were compared at day 5 or 6 from a separate hospital in France. Patients receiving treatment with HCQ+AZ experienced numerically fewer cases of virologic failure (43% pooled virologic failure; 29/71 patients) (Figure s3 ). There is very low certainty in this comparison of treatment effect mainly due to very high-risk selection bias, making any claims of effectiveness highly uncertain. In addition, relying on intermediary outcomes, such as viral clearance to determine patient-important outcomes (including a reduction in development of pneumonia, hospital or ICU admission, or need for intubation) add another layer of imprecision.",

The mechanism of action of remdesivir is premature termination of viral RNA transcription [60] . Its use improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice [59] . The efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir was tested in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection [61] . Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 hours prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions [61] . Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 hours postinoculation reduced clinical signs, virus replication in the lungs, and decreased the presence and severity of lung lesions. A recent case series of 53 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received remdesivir under a compassionate-use protocol reported clinical improvement in 68% after a median follow-up of 18 days, with 13% mortality and a generally acceptable toxicity profile [62] . However, there was no comparison group of similar patients who received standard care at the participating institutions.

Human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV-2, use ACE2 to bind to human targets and gain entry into target cells [63] . It has been theorized that NSAIDs, due to upregulation in ACE2 in human target cells, may lead to a more severe course of COVID-19 in those taking NSAIDs. While no causal evidence of adverse outcomes with NSAIDs in the management of COVID-19 have been published, there are well known risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal adverse events [64, 65] .",

Illness severity should be reasonably defined using readily available clinical criteria of end organ failure, like the degree of M a n u s c r i p t respiratory failure using Sa02 or Fi02:Pa02 ratios for lower respiratory tract infection, as opposed to location-based severity determinations such as ICU admission, which can lead to bias based on resource limitations (i.e., bed availability) or regional/institutional practice patterns [75] .

(Knowledge gap)Summary of the evidenceNo studies were found specifically examining the role of steroids for the treatment of the acute COVID-19. Corticosteroids were widely used in China to prevent the development of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Four retrospective cohort studies[25,26,28,29] examined several interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Wuhan area. Studies show variability in the benefit of corticosteroid use(Tables 4 and 5). Study limitations include: 1) critical information not reported on baseline risk/severe pneumonia/ARDS; 2) confounding by indication; 3) unadjusted analyses; 4) timing of disease not given; 5) large variability in treatments given. Due to these limitations, a sensible pooling effort to determine possible treatment effect was not deemed possible.",
