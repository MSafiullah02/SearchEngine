We sought to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of all communityacquired viral respiratory infections requiring hospitalization during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on co-infection rates and clinical outcomes. Methods Over a 10-week period, all admissions to our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, were screened for respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 as well as a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens were systematically tested for. Information was collated on clinical outcomes, including requirement for mechanical ventilation and inhospital mortality.",

The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4% (8/431); all patients with co-infection had mild disease and stayed in communal settings.

            "text": "In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China; since then, the situation has evolved into a global pandemic. [1] However, differentiating COVID-19 remains challenging, as common clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including fever, cough and dyspnea, are indistinguishable from those caused by other respiratory viruses. [2] Furthermore, even during outbreaks of respiratory disease caused by a novel pathogen, common respiratory viruses can still circulate and potentially cause co-infections. [3] However, early reports suggested that coinfection with SARS CoV-2 and other viral respiratory pathogens was rare. Estimates of coinfection ranged from 0-3% in some cohorts; [1, 4, 5] sporadic case reports of co-infection between SARS CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens have also been reported in the literature. [6, 7, 8] More recent studies, however, have reported much higher rates of coinfection, with almost one-fifth of patients reported to have a concomitant viral coinfection alongside SARS CoV-2. [9] Establishing the likelihood of co-infection is crucial, as continued testing for other respiratory pathogens was endorsed as a strategy to aid the evaluation of patients with potential COVID-19 by identifying an alternative etiology, given the low rates of co-infection that were initially reported. [10, 11] However, this remains controversial given continued uncertainty over the likelihood of co-infection. [9] Furthermore, maintaining surveillance for common respiratory viruses remains challenging given the relative scarcity of studies investigating the viral etiology of pneumonia, due to limited interventions. [12] This challenge is exacerbated by resource limitations experienced during a pandemic, which can overwhelm even well-resourced hospital systems. Nevertheless, common respiratory viruses J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst hospitalized inpatients with respiratory diagnoses. [13] In Singapore, a Southeast Asian city-state, the first imported case of COVID-19 was reported in end-January 2020; followed by the first documented case of local transmission in early February 2020. [14] By end-February 2020, the majority of cases were attributed to local transmission. [15] As part of the national strategy of containment, heightened vigilance was maintained for all hospital admissions presenting from the community with respiratory symptoms, in order to detect cases of COVID-19 through enhanced surveillance. [16] At our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, from early February 2020 all admissions were systematically screened for respiratory symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 was tested for along with other common respiratory viruses. Notably, surveillance for common respiratory viruses was maintained even during an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; this allowed us to evaluate the etiology of community-acquired viral respiratory infections amongst hospitalized inpatients during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on the incidence of coinfection and clinical outcomes.",

Respiratory specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This was done by qualitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Viral RNA was first isolated from patient's oropharyngeal swab samples and RT-PCR was performed targeting E gene and ORF1b-nsp14 for SARS-CoV-2. [19, 20] At our institution, if the first sample was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a second specimen was sent for repeated testing 24 hours from the first one. If primary physicians assessed that a viral syndrome could not be excluded as a cause of the patient's respiratory symptoms (eg. normal procalcitonin, lymphopenia), respiratory specimens were also processed in parallel for a common panel of viral respiratory pathogens via respiratory virus (RV) multiplex PCR testing.

This allowed a more accurate estimate of the burden of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, particularly as testing was done in a systematic fashion over a sustained period. In line with early reports from China and elsewhere, the burden of co-infection detected in our population was low. The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4%, similar to the rates of 0-3% reported in other cohorts. [1, 4, 5] While other studies cited co-infection in up to one-fifth of patients, [9] this could potentially be due to spatiotemporal variation in viral epidemiology. In particular, in our cohort all cases of community-acquired viral co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred amongst patients living in communal settings. Increased odds of viral respiratory infection have been associated with increased numbers of co-habitants. [12] Of note, the majority of co-infected individuals also reported ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 in their accommodations. Previously, identification of co-circulation of human metapneumovirus and SARS-associated coronavirus during a nosocomial SARS outbreak raised the possibility of significant interaction; it was postulated that upper respiratory symptoms caused by one pathogen might enhance the dispersal of another through aerosol generation and contribute to increased infectivity. [3] However, co-infection did not appear to translate into increased morbidity or mortality. All individuals in our cohort with SARS-CoV-2 and other coinfections had mild disease; none required supplemental oxygen or intubation and mechanical ventilation. This is in keeping with other reports suggesting that patients with COVID-19 and coinfections did not have a more severe prognosis. [1] Common respiratory viruses account for a significant proportion of hospitalizations and remain a significant contributor to in-hospital mortality and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f morbidity, [12, 13] even during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, in our cohort, the in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were even lower than patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted to our institution over the same time period. While much higher rates of invasive ventilation and in-hospital mortality have been reported in other cohorts of COVID-19 patients, [1, 2, 21] this is likely attributed to the continued functioning of our healthcare system and aggressive strategy of containment employed in Singapore over the time period of the study, [14] [15] [16] in which all patients with COVID-19 were initially admitted to hospital, regardless of disease severity. spread. [18] These interventions likely have potential to reduce transmission of not just COVID-19, but also other respiratory viruses as well. [23] Given the in-hospital morbidity and mortality associated with viral respiratory infections, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak affords a valuable opportunity to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, as screening for respiratory viral infection reduces risk of transmission to hospitalized inpatients. [24] However, to assess the effectiveness of interventions, surveillance is necessary to establish a baseline.",

Additionally, while seasonality is a well-known factor in outbreaks of viral respiratory infection in temperate countries, our study was conducted in a hospital in Singapore, a tropical country. Local studies have shown that while seasonality does exist, consistent seasonal variations are mainly observed only in limited numbers of pathogens. [25] This study focused on hospitalized inpatients; hospitalized inpatients may not represent the true burden of disease in the community. However, given the aggressive strategy of containment employed in Singapore, [14] [15] [16] over the study period all patients with COVID-19 were admitted initially to hospital, regardless of disease severity. Hence, the coinfection rate reported in this study may be more representative, given that we detected J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coinfections solely in patients with mild disease, and exhaustive in-hospital testing was conducted for all suspected COVID-19 cases regardless of disease severity.",

Coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral respiratory pathogens were rare and occurred mainly in individuals with mild disease staying in congregate settings; there was no increase in morbidity or mortality associated with co-infections. The in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were even lower compared to patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted over the same time period. Continued surveillance for other respiratory pathogens during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains important, in order to identify the rate of co-infection, assess the burden of disease and evaluate the effectiveness of subsequent interventions.",

While effective interventions for viral respiratory infections remain limited (eg. neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza), maintaining surveillance for common respiratory viruses may be of value in specific circumstances. In hospitals with large numbers of COVID-19 patients and limited numbers of single rooms, cohorting COVID-19 patients together may be a consideration. However, depending on the co-infection rate, it is possible that co-circulation of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses may result in subsequent nosocomial outbreaks if such cohorting occurs. [3] Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has necessitated the introduction of various infection control interventions, such as enhanced cohorting, better J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f distancing, and usage of personal protective equipment, in order to mitigate nosocomial",
