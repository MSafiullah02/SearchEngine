This includes studies pertaining to the biology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease, host response and host genetics, and potential therapies [3] [4] [5] . The European COVID-19 Data Portal [6] , announced by the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on 20 April 2020, for example, is setting out to help scientists coordinate the sharing of research data related to the fight against COVID-19 using the European Open Science Cloud. Additional activities include new global efforts that aim to sequence SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes along with patient-matched host genomes or to utilize existing cohorts such as the UK Biobank [7] , in order to dissect the role of host genetics in the COVID-19 disease course. On top of this, new international platforms such as Crowdfight COVID-19 [8] or data against COVID-19 [9] aim to empower scientists to work together in fighting SARS-CoV-2, by connecting expertise from different fields with data resources. Another example is a regular workshop series hosted by the European Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), which seeks to connect the expertise of leading researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence for the fight against COVID-19.",

We focus on how the current health crisis has affected patterns of work in the life sciences and highlight who in the life science community may be particularly vulnerable in the current situation. We based a large part of this editorial on a survey that we circulated among colleagues in Germany, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Canada, Turkey, and the USA between 15 and 23 April 2020. In total, we received 881 responses, 72% of which were from trainees, 11% from support staff, and 17% from professors. Sixtytwo percent of the respondents characterized themselves as experimentalists, 34% as computational biologists, and 4% as administrative support personnel.",

This is likely to result in financial consequences, as repetition of work will consume additional funding. Twenty-five percent of respondents reported at least 1 month and up to 6 months of work had been lost due to laboratory shutdown-with large differences seen between wet lab (73%) and dry lab (31%) researchers. At the same time, levels of self-perceived productivity dropped, where dry lab scientists were much more likely to continue carrying out their work from home as expected (29% of dry lab scientists, but only 10% of wet lab scientists, reported \"at least 80% productivity\"). There was also a more pronounced increase in self-perceived levels of stress (during times of lockdown compared to before) among wet lab scientists, with higher increases seen in trainees and non-tenured professors. On the other hand, some respondents reported that their stress during the laboratory shutdown was lower than during their normal work routine, which could be explained by less frequent interruptions in their daily routine or perhaps reduced expectations from peers and lab heads to deliver results.",

We observed some differences between male and female scientists, with females reporting fewer productive hours. This is, in part, due to the higher rate of females among wet lab scientists (70% of female versus 60% of male respondents work primarily experimentally) and likely also reflects differences in childcare duties. This suggests a particular vulnerability of female scientists during an institutional shutdown. Another vulnerable group appears to be expatriates, especially trainees working in a life sciences institute located on a continent other than the one where their home country is. Thirty-four percent of these young scientists live alone, compared with only 14% of respondents working in their home country. These expatriates might feel more isolated and may also face potential problems with frequent updates to local regulations due to language difficulties.",

At all career stages, VC has gained importance in running group meetings or journal clubs and to meet collaborators. More than 90% of life scientists at all career stages reported in our survey that they were now more regularly making use of VC for these purposes. Nearly half of the respondents stated that their level of communication with their supervisor, mentor, or line manager had not changed (48%), whereas one fifth said it even increased (22%), which suggests that VC is fortunately heavily used and appears to be an effective means of communication and mentoring.",

Especially trainees reported that they have been making great use of opportunities for e-learning, including VC-based bioinformatics courses, with a higher rate of wet lab (72%) than dry lab (50%) trainees benefiting from e-learning during an institutional shutdown. This indicates that especially trainees normally based in the wet lab use the time of shutdown to expand their skillsets. This includes many young scientists now learning programming languages. For them, there is an opportunity to use the unintended break in their experimental work to develop into more interdisciplinary hybrid (wet/dry) data scientists.",

Indeed, there are early signs that manuscript submissions to scientific journals have already been increasing since COVID-19-related restrictions have emerged [4] . And somewhat impressively, over a hundred respondents (102, 18% of the total) indicated that they shifted the regular scientific activities to be able to directly contribute to research with the aim to combat COVID-19. A recent inquiry circulated among members of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) provides an independent testament of the willingness of life scientists to contribute to fighting COVID-19 (https://www.data-against-covid.org). This study also showed that life scientists actively support virologists, epidemiologists, and health care workers by contributing reagents, instruments, protective equipment, and IT infrastructure (such as highperformance as well as cloud computing platforms) or by providing clinical tasks and communicating with journalists and the public (https://www.embo.org/news/articles/202 0/life-science-researchers-efforts-to-fight-covid-19).",
