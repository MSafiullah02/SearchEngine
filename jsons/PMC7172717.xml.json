Samples were batched, with results not available to clinicians. A region of the HRV 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) was sequenced, with a type assigned when it shared \u226597% nucleotide identity with the same region of a fully sequenced HRV using methods described previously (Table 1\n).9 Briefly, 2 \u03bcl of nucleic acid extract was reverse transcribed in a total 20 \u03bcl reaction volume (OneStep RT-PCR kit, QIAGEN, Australia; 50 \u00b0C for 60 min), subjected to a hot-start (95 \u00b0C for 15 min) then a \u223c380 bp complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified using 45 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, 55 \u00b0C for 20 s and 72 \u00b0C for 50 s with a final incubation at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The product from positive reactions was subjected to nucleotide sequencing using the PRISM BigDye sequencing kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence analysis on products ranging from >200 nucleotides (nt) in length was conducted using Geneious Pro.10 This assay has been shown to be at least as clinically sensitive as others widely used.11 If an HRV was repeatedly positive in the screening assay but no useful sequence could be obtained it was called untypeable. Sequences containing two picornavirus templates (a member of an enterovirus (EV) and HRV species) that could not be further interpreted were designated \u201cdouble\u201d infections. A post hoc analysis of all HRV samples and review of clinical data were undertaken.",
