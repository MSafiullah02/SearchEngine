However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health. We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19.",

            "text": "From the Great Plague to the Spanish flu, mankind has already witnessed pandemics in the course of its History (Taubenberger, Kash & Morens, 2019; Hays, 2005 ). Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented for at least two reasons. First, with more than three billion people in confinement at the date of writing this paper, its magnitude and impacts are unparalleled. Second, there is a fundamental difference between the period of forced isolation we are collectively living and historical quarantines: the overwhelming presence of technology (Guitton, 2020) . Online technologies became the privileged channel for governments and supra-national entities such as the World Health Organization to convey their messages and recommendations. From online shopping and telework to distance learning, online technologies are also becoming the main tool in trying to deal with the economic consequences of the crisis. More importantly, technology is becoming central to maintain active social interactions. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis exacerbates the importance of a hidden form of social inequality, digital inequalities. Indeed, differences exist between individuals and social groups in terms of access to technologies but also in terms of their capacity to obtain benefices from their use of technology (DiMaggio & Hargittai, 2001; Hargittai, 2010; B\u00fcchi, Festic & Latzer, 2018) .",

Four proximal factors are impacting to the degree of ability to use technologies efficiently and effectively (Hargittai, 2003) : 1) technical means (the quality of the equipment that one can access, both in terms of hardware and software as well as the power and reliability of Internet connection), 2) autonomy of use (the location where technology is accessed, and perceived freedom to use it as wanted), 3) social support networks (assistance from other experimented users), and 4) experience (time dimension enabling people to be familiar enough with the technology for retaining benefits from its use).",

Indeed, public decisions regarding network covering politics (DiMaggio & Hargittai, 2001; Warf, 2010) , macroeconomic constraints resulting in the fact that some countries have less Internet penetration than others (Poushter, 2016) and disparities within regions of a country (Cruz-Jesus et al., 2016; Haight et al., 2014) .

As an emerging form of social exclusion, digital exclusion contributes to worsen material and social deprivation. Being digitally excluded has consequences on health determinants such as education, work, and social networks, which impacts contribute in return to maintain limited access and use of technologies, a phenomenon referred to as the \"digital vicious cycle\" (Baum et al., 2014) .

Therefore, updating technological equipment will unlikely rank high in the budget of these families. However, using outdated equipment generates longer delays in accessing online resources, if accessible at all, which can create a less satisfying experience, resulting in fewer opportunities to use of Internet technologies and consequently fewer opportunities to develop digital literacy skills. In contrast, more economically favored households will have a high incentive to upgrade their equipment -whether for telework, learning or entertainment. This will result in a worsening of pre-existing equipment-based digital inequalities. COVID-19triggered home isolation creates an unprecedented Internet traffic load, which results in slower connections for multiple Internet users (Bergman & Iyengar, 2020). However, this will not affect everyone in the same way, depending notably on the local cost of Internet subscription. Households with low incomes might not be able to afford the best connection both in terms of speed and data usage, without sacrificing essential spendings. In opposition, those with the greatest Internet packages subscription will likely not experience the slower connections at the same scale. Furthermore, households with more members will have to share Internet devices, downloading data and entertainment modules (such as Netflix accounts or television decoder).",

The context of COVID-19 raises new socio-technical challenges to the contribution of social support networks in developing digital literacy. Indeed, the isolation requirements make it harder to actualize the support one can give in technology use because a minimum of digital literacy is needed for the person to receive helpful support. This creates an unprecedented paradox for the population digitally disfavored: how to find helpful support in digital technology use, having mostly only digital technologies as mean for action? For instance, when facing a problem with Internet connection or amenities, support might only be offered through phone communication, leaving the person to realize the manipulations by themselves. Hence, for the more digitally disadvantaged individuals, support could be harder to obtain or to meet the needs, whereas those with higher digital skills could adapt to news means of support much easier.",

However, some of the most vulnerable social groups, including the aged, the homeless, recent immigrants, or rural residents are those who are the most difficult to reach if digital media serve as the main route of communication (Lee, exacerbated as they merge with digital literacy inequalities. These two factors result in differences in eHealth literacy -people's literacy, knowledge, motivation, and competence to access, understand, and appraised health information from electronics sources and to apply it to make decisions in everyday life to address healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion to maintain or improve quality of life (Norman & Skinner, 2006; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012) . People Given that the requirements of home isolation are understood, other factors might impair the possibility to actualize recommended behaviors. These difficulties are linked to the level of digital skills, social networks composition, and financial constraints. With the impossibility to realize some everyday life essential errands or activity, people need to find suitable alternatives, such as online grocery shopping or having someone to get groceries for them. This is especially true for the population who are most at risk of mortality if they contracted the virus, such as the elderly and people suffering from chronic health conditions (Zhou et al., 2020) . Access to virtual alternatives is limited by a restrained set of digital skills and economical constraints related to delivery fees.

Finally, in a context where medical workforce and resources are getting scarce due both to the overwhelming situation in health care units and to the fact that more and more health care professionals are getting infected as well, we are witnessing the premises of attempts to telemedicine interventions, particularly for telediagnosis (Greenhalgh, Koh & Car, 2020) . While this provides new avenues, it also compromises the chances for the most digitally vulnerable to get access to the health care system in comparison with the rest of the population. This is especially true in countries with no universal care coverage, where low-income households won't have enough money to pay for those services and might have to resort to face to face emergency services, where they will be more at risk to contract the virus or spread it.",

Strategies to detect and block erroneous information and fake news have to be implemented systematically. While an equilibrium has to be made between freedom of speech and level of control, using legal ways to avoid the propagation of potentially harmful information might be required at some point. One of the most powerful ways to fight against fake news is to increase the visibility of validated sources. Work can be done with the giants of Internet to ensure that news or information coming from the governments or other validated public health organizations are systematically ranked first in the various search engines. Active information diffusion by government officials, employees, and citizens on social networks can strongly contribute to the propagation of important elements. Official websites and webpages can be made more visible online and more user-friendly.",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly showing the world populations that we are still not fully prepared to deal with the societal impacts of pandemics at a global level. From earlier epidemics, we know that socially and economically disadvantaged people are at higher risk when it comes to catching the disease. A series of political and community interventions aiming to solidify the social safety net is needed to support the most socially vulnerable population and prevent increasing both their vulnerability to the pandemic, and the social health inequalities. Indeed, although vulnerabilities and social inequalities existed long before the COVID-19 crisis, there are getting exacerbated in the current context. This crisis is unmasking an emerging form of technology-related social inequalities that were rampant since some times already, but did not receive the full attention it deserved.",

However, more research will be needed to get a deeper understanding of these bi-directional interactions, as well as to document the feasibility and efficiency of potential mitigation strategiesparticularly in regards to resource availability and constraints, social acceptability and political context, and timeline of implementation. Considering that important variations exist in political and economical systems across countries, mitigation strategies implementation will need to be anchored in a specific socio-cultural context. Future research will have to navigate between large-scale investigations of how online behavior impacted and was impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and on smaller scale studies aiming at document possible interventions. Beside purely quantitative large-scale investigations, there is a critical need to consider and document individuals' experiences of the crisis. This will be particularly important in the context of progressive end of the quarantine that has been initiated in many countries. However, equilibrium will have to be reached between the need to quickly document the phenomenon as the crisis unfolds in the one hand, and the need for scientific robustness in the other hand. In this context, mixed studies combining quantitative analyses with strong qualitative observations may be an interesting solution. In this view, qualitative designs will have to consider generating large enough dataset so that quantitative analyses could be performed on them. Reciprocally and complementarily, typical quantitative studies might benefit from integrating qualitative data to help contextualize the results, in order to insure operationability of data necessarily obtained during a limited, and unique period.",
