            "text": "The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for the treatment of bladder cancer have over the years become the de facto standard consulted by more practitioners than any other guideline document. Why is this? My sense is that it is because, unhindered by the legalese that encumbers other guidelines committees, the EAU is able to list, in a succinct and definitive manner and based on an expert review of the latest data, what the expert panel believes is in the best interest of a wide group of patients. An immediate example that comes to mind is in the non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) guidelines [1], in which the EAU clearly demarcates the risk categories into low and high, with all high-grade tumors falling into the high risk category, all low-grade tumors falling into the low risk category, and everything else in between. This prognostically relevant, yet relatively simple classification has led to the EAU risk stratification being adopted by most investigators in the design of clinical trials over other guidelines that are more complex, without obvious rationale [2].",

Several countries are in near total lockdown, and access to health care has been severely limited for our patients. To provide some guidance to our patients, the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network have put together a frequently asked questions section on the website [5]. In addition, various groups have turned to social media to disseminate information about risk-stratified triaging of patients for appropriate care in the setting of limited access to surgical suites, chemotherapy units, and radiation oncology centers.",

At the same time, the risk of immunosuppression with NAC must be weighed against the average 5\u20139% benefit for most patients. In addition, in some centers, if the radiation units are separate and distinct from the main hospital, then radiation therapy\u2014which is listed as an alternative\u2014might actually be the preferred option to long delays to surgery.",

For second-line treatment in metastatic disease, pembrolizumab is recommended by the guidelines, which is appropriate, since most clinical trials examining other strategies have been halted, with resources diverted towards dealing with the current pandemic.",

Moreover, if not administered in a timely, appropriate manner, the therapy often fails (eg, surgery performed when the tumor has progressed to node-positive disease due to delays), yet still leads to toxicity in many.
