The majority of DCs (84%) are considered general practice, and 65% focus on wellness and maintenance of health. 8 Most DCs in the US report that they are science-based and use current chiropractic and medical research when making patient care decisions (90%). 8 The chiropractic profession is well known for its high rates of patient satisfaction and a hands-on approach to patient care. 9 People seek out chiropractic care for a variety of health concerns. 8 A Gallup study in 2015 reported that more than 33 million American adults visited a DC in the prior year. 10 The median 12-month utilization of chiropractic services has been estimated to be 9.1% globally. 11 Approximately 29% of adults 65 years of age and older report using complementary health approaches, of which over 60% stated these approaches were important for maintaining their health and well-being. Of those who have used complementary methods, 8% reported using chiropractic care in the last year. 12 Managing this section of the population is especially relevant since COVID-19 seems to result in greater morbidity and mortality with older adults. 13, 14 Many entities are integral to the education, practice, and licensure of the chiropractic profession. For example, chiropractic educational institutions in the US are accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE), which is a programmatic accrediting agency. Doctor of chiropractic programs (DCPs) are supported by the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC), an organization comprised of leaders from chiropractic training programs. The NCMIC provides multiple services to chiropractic practitioners, such as insurance and financial products. The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) membership is comprised of legislatively created boards delegated with the authority to regulate the profession in the interest of public protection.",

This communication emphasized CCE's commitment to promoting flexibility in response to COVID-19 while assuring compliance with accreditation standards. The CCE provided guidance in allowing flexibility of course delivery temporarily, without the need for a Substantive Change Requests that would typically be required. This is important as Substantive Change Requests are lengthy applications for any significant change to a chiropractic program and are only reviewed biannually by the Council. Thereby, this action helped to avoid any delay that would have been caused by waiting for a Substantial Change approval, which would have hindered a program's ability to shift educational delivery rapidly enough to keep programs on track with education delivery and assessment of learning.",
