Indeed, the generation of auto-antibodies against a phospholipid protein complex (Lupus anticoagulants) [30] and a glycan moiety of human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid [31] in SARS-CoV infection has been suggested. Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome were characterized with a fast and strong anti-N antibody response [6], [32]. The pathophysiological significance and clinical relevance of cross-reacting anti-N antibody with IL-11 are unknown. IL-11 is widely expressed in different tissues including lung, thymus, bone, and central nervous system. Physiologically, IL-11 regulates hematopoiesis and bone metabolism, and inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines [16], [17]. In this regard, it is of interest to note that thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were commonly observed in patients during the early phase of SRAS-CoV infection [33], [34], [35]. Furthermore, osteonecrosis has been reported in some convalescent SARS patients [36], [37]. Significant levels of anti-N antibody were generally detected 1\u20132 weeks after the onset of symptoms [7], [32], and therefore the inhibitory effect on IL-11 of those cross-reactive anti-N antibody on early SARS symptoms development might play a very limited role. On the other hand, the cross-reactivity of anti-N antibody with IL-11 suggests that the SCoV-N protein shares a similar structural motif with IL-11. The possibility cannot be excluded that the common structural motifs of N protein and IL-11 are important for mediating various biological activities of IL-11, and therefore the presence of N proteins in the early infection cycle may act as a functional antagonist of IL-11. However, SCoV-N protein itself did not stimulate STAT 3 phosphorylation, and the presence of SCoV-N protein also did not modulate IL-11-induced STAT 3 phosphorylation in IEC-18 cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that SCoV-N protein and IL-11 share a common structural motif that binds and activates the STAT 3-coupled IL-11 receptor.",
