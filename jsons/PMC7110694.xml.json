In a symptomatic patient, symptoms at presentation may include fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, malaise, cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain may be present as part of the upper respiratory syndrome or as the main presenting complain [13]. Pneumonia is common at presentation [13,14,[19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]]. Severe infection occurs specially among older patients with comorbidities and present with acute respiratory, renal failure and shock [24,25]. The crude fatality rate average is 35% among primary cases and 20% among secondary cases [3,[25], [26], [27]]. Predictors of poor outcome includes age above 60 years, male gender, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease and chronic renal disease, low albumin level and progressive lymphocytopenia [[24], [25], [26]]. Use of steroids and continuous renal replacement therapy have also been suggested as predictors of worse outcome [26]. MERS-CoV infections is noticeably infrequent in pediatric population and pediatric patients are usually asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, infections frequently acquired from household contact and is associated with low morbidity and mortality [[28], [29], [30]].",

Earlier studies estimated that around 12.5\u201325% of MERS-CoV infections may be asymptomatic [31,32]. More recent studies suggested up to 50% may be asymptomatic [33]. Differences in the study setting, populations studied, and methods of screening may explain this variability [22,24,27,31,34,35]. Use of serologic testing can underestimate disease burden due to waning antibodies titer over time [15,16,22]. Most of asymptomatic cases reported have been detected following aggressive contact tracing [15,32,36,37]. Prolonged viral excretion from the respiratory tract for up to 4 weeks has been documented specially in patients with pneumonia at presentation [37,38]. Albeit in low loads, virus secretion was also reported for shorter periods in urine and stool [37,38]. Patients with mild symptoms can also have viral shedding for up to 10 days from symptoms onset [35,39].",

MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in camel sera long before first human case reported [10,11]. MERS-CoV in camels causes only mild symptoms and traded infected camels from Africa has likely introduced the virus into the Arabian Peninsula dromedary camels and eventually camel to human transmission was first recognized in 2012 [3]. MERS-CoV infection is widespread among dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula [54,55].",

Viral genomic sequences were similar in infected human and the one isolated from camels in outbreak site and many of the camel viruses can be classified into clades that correlate with human outbreaks [60]. There is a high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV infection among camel shepherds and slaughter-house workers [61]. Although dromedary camels are the only confirmed intermediate animal host for MERS-CoV Infection, other domestic livestock like sheep and goats in contact with MERS-CoV infected camels may be at risk of infection [62]. Other livestock role in human transmission is not yet clear. However, exposure to camels could not be documented in more than half of patients with primary MERS-CoV infections [20]. High MERS-CoV seroprevalence among those exposed to camels is not always consistent [63]. Human disease burden is not directly proportional to potential exposure to camels indicating that although camel-to-human transmission occurs it is not very efficient and occur relatively uncommonly.",
