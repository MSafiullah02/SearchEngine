The nucleic acid targets of the multiplex panel consisted of influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenzaviruses 1\u20134 (PIV), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus and entero/rhinoviruses.

Disease was classified as severe when the respiratory condition warranted admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or High Dependency Unit (HDU), and not severe when admitted to the general paediatric wards. To avoid clinician bias, the case note of each patient was reviewed by the authors retrospectively before the entero/rhinovirus typing results were known. Cases in which the contribution of RTI to disease severity was uncertain were further reviewed and categorized after extensive discussions between the authors. Chronic respiratory diseases, chronic heart conditions, neurological conditions, prematurity, immunosupression and other underlying medical conditions were recorded. Bacterial and fungal organisms detected in respiratory samples by culture or immunofluorescence were considered as co-pathogens if case review concluded that they were significant and not due to colonization. Organisms detected in normally sterile sites, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, were considered as significant unless specimen contamination was suspected. Co-infection was defined as the detection of a co-pathogen 7 days before or after the entero/rhinovirus positive sample.",

In our study, HRV-C was found to be associated with a wide spectrum of disease severity. After multiple regression analysis, a significant risk for increased severity was found in HRV-C infected patients under the age of 3 years and in patients with chronic respiratory diseases or asthma independent of HRV species or age.

However, a recent study also found a low prevalence of HRV-B in the community [27] suggesting that the low frequency of HRV-B may be related to biological fitness rather than selection bias.
