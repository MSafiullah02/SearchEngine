Cys506 was mutated to a serine to prevent nonspecific intersubunit disulfide bond formation. The expression vector was transformed into the E. coli SHuffle T7 expression cell line (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). A 20 ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB\u2010Miller medium, and cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.6. Expression of the ASLV TM was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2\u2010d\u20101\u2010thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The temperature was lowered to 18\u00b0C, and cells were harvested 18 h postinduction by centrifugation at 4000 rpm (Sorvall SLC\u20104000 rotor; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 20 min. Cells were resuspended in 25 ml 1 \u00d7 Ni\u2010NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris\u2010HCl, pH 7.5; 300 mM NaCl; and 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS and 1 \u00d7 EDTA\u2010free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Cells were then lysed at 30 kpsi using a hydraulic cell disruption system (Constant Systems, Kenneshaw, GA, USA) and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm (Sorvall SS\u201034 rotor) for 45 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was then applied to a 2\u2010ml Ni\u2010NTA column (Thermo Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) by gravity flow at 1 ml/min. Protein was eluted in sequential steps using increasing concentrations of imidazole (125, 250, 375, or 500 mM in 1 \u00d7 Ni\u2010NTA buffer).

The N\u2010terminal helix displays the typical HR motif (a, b, c d, e, f, g), where a and d positions are apolar residues that are located at the coiled coil interface, and e and g are solvent\u2010exposed polar residues (36, 37). The repeating 3\u20104\u20103\u20104\u20103\u20104 periodicity of the HR allows the hydrophobic leucine, isoleucine, and valine residues to form the \u201cknobs\u2010into\u2010holes\u201d packing with a neighboring chain to form the trimeric core (36, 37). The hydrophobic knob\u2010into\u2010holes packing is interrupted by a single aspargine layer (Asn479) that interacts with a chloride ion within the inner core (Fig. 1\nC). In addition, the ASLV TM N\u2010terminal HR1 region has a stutter\u2010phase shift that corresponds to a 4\u2010residue insertion, which results in core packing discontinuities and underwinding of the coiled\u2010coil core (residues 458\u2013461). Similar stutters and chloride binding sites have also been noted in other members of the class I fusion proteins, such as those from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (23, 26, 30, 38). Another feature of the ASLV TM is the similarity of its HR1 base region (residues 478\u2013504) with a putative immunosuppressive domain found in EBOV and MARV (~50% sequence identity), and \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3\u2010retroviruses (~36% sequence identity) (39). Synthetic peptides of the immunosuppressive motif from EBOV or MARV modulated the expression of interferon\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102 and IL\u201010 cytokines, lower CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell activation, and increase immune cell apoptosis (40).",

The CR region contains a random coil His\u2010Gly\u2010His\u2010Gly loop, a 310 helix, and a highly conserved CX6CC motif (residues 494\u2013502). The CX6CC motif forms an internal disulfide bond (C494\u2013C501) that stabilizes the loop containing the 310 helix. In the \u03b4 and \u03b3\u2010retroviruses, such as HTLV\u20101 and MoMLV, the SU subunit carries a CXXC thiol\u2010disulfide exchange motif that is involved in disulfide bond formation to the third cysteine in the CX6CC motif (41, 42). A thiol\u2010disulfide exchange induces isomerization of the SU\u2010TM disulfide bond to initiate fusion. In ASLV Env and filovirus glycoproteins, the SU subunit lacks the CXXC disulfide exchange motif, but the attachment subunit remains covalently linked to the TM. In ASLV, in lieu of the CXXC thiol\u2013disulfide exchange motif (43), it was proposed that the low pH might trigger the structural rearrangements observed during viral fusion (5, 12, 43, 44).",

Side\u2010by\u2010side analysis of these structures reveals significant variation in the lengths of the HR1 and HR2 helices, presence of stutter regions, and surface electrostatic potential. Structural analysis previously demonstrated that the fusion machineries of \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3\u2010retroviruses are similar to EBOV and MARV (refs. 25, 26, 45, and unpublished results). This finding led to the hypothesis that the retroviral and filoviral fusion subunits diverged from a common ancestral fusion protein. Not surprisingly, the ASLV TM also shares a strong overall structural similarity with transmembrane subunits of the \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3\u2010retroviruses and the glycoproteins of EBOV and MARV (Fig. 1\nD). A closer inspection, however, reveals differences in the CR region. In all characterized \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3\u2010retroviral and filoviral fusion subunits, a 310 helix is formed directly after the central HR1 helix, which is followed by a critical glycine\u2010glycine (Gly\u2010Gly) linker and a disulfide bond\u2010stabilized single\u2010turn \u03b1\u2010helix in the CX6CC motif. Mutations to the Gly\u2010Gly motif in HTLV\u20101 Env render the virus defective in fusion and prevent the formation of the 6\u2010helix bundle in the maltose\u2010binding protein\u2010gp21 chimera (25, 34). In the ASLV TM, no 310 helix is directly after the HR1 core, and the Gly\u2010Gly pair is interrupted by His490 and His492 to give a His\u2010Gly\u2010His\u2010Gly motif. Moreover, the short \u03b1\u2010helix observed in other retroviruses is replaced by a 310 helix. These features of the ASLV CR region, in particular the His\u2010Gly\u2010His\u2010Gly motif, are important for viral fusion (46) and are conserved in all ASLV subtypes (Fig. 1\nE).",

            "text": "The 2\u2010step entry mechanism of ASLV requires that the envelope glycoprotein function at both neutral and low pH. We performed CD thermal denaturation assays to investigate the stability of the ASLV fusion subunit as a function of pH (pH 5.0 to 8.5). At neutral pH, the denaturation of ASLV TM was irreversible with a melting temperature (T\nm) of 67\u00b0C. This finding is consistent with the melting temperatures of other class I viral fusion proteins (47\u201349). Although thermodynamic parameters (i.e., \u0394G\u00b0 values) cannot be calculated from an irreversible thermal denaturation study, the apparent Tm provides a simple measure of protein stability. The ASLV TM was stable over a wide pH range (Fig.\n\n2\n\nA), with a slightly increased apparent melting temperature (\u0394Tm=2\u20135\u00b0C) at pH values corresponding to early (pH 6.0\u20136.5) and late (pH 5.0\u20136.0) endosomal stages of the viral life cycle. Considering the nature of the ASLV 2\u2010step entry mechanism, our results are in alignment with the biology of the virus. Initially, receptor binding of ASLV SU triggers conformational changes at the cell surface, where the ASLV TM structure is rearranged to form the extended prehairpin intermediate at neutral pH. Then, low pH conditions trigger additional conformational changes to form the hemifusion intermediate and postfusion 6\u2010helix bundle conformation. Given that ASLV TM must interact at both the plasma and endocytic membranes, the TM must be stable over a wide range of pH.",

In contrast, fusion proteins of viruses that traffic to the endosome, such as influenza A, EBOV, and MARV, are most stable only at low pH (48\u201350). Previous studies of EBOV GP2 revealed a dramatic decrease in melting temperature (\u0394Tm=37\u00b0C) on a pH change from 5.3 to 6.1 (48). For viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane, such as the \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3 retroviruses, we have shown that the fusion subunits are most stable at neutral pH (Fig. 2\nB). Thermal denaturation analysis of HTLV\u20101 TM revealed that at values of pH < 7.0, the Tm decreased by >40\u00b0C relative to that at neutral pH, suggesting a dramatic destabilization of the fusion protein (Fig. 2\nB). At values of pH > 7.0, HTLV\u20101 gp21 was very stable and did not fully denature even at 99\u00b0C. In addition, the thermal melts above pH 7.0 had a biphasic nature, which was not seen in ASLV TM. The first transition (Tm1) likely corresponds to the denaturation of the HR2 helix and the second and larger transition (Tm2) to denaturation of the HR1 trimeric core. At values of pH < 7.0, a cooperative single transition was observed, suggesting that the HR2 region is not as tightly associated to the HR1 core. One explanation for the neutral\u2010pH\u2010dependent stability of HTLV\u20101 gp21 is electrostatic interactions. Previous structural analysis of retroviral fusion subunits revealed that HTLV\u20101 gp21 contains an extensive series of inter\u2010 and intrachain salt bridges between HR1 and HR2 regions (25, 51). The relative contribution of electrostatic interactions to protein stability predominates at neutral pH as both side chains are fully ionized (reviewed in ref. 52). However, as the virus is taken up into the low\u2010pH endosomes, the strength of the ion pair is thus reduced. Moreover, HTLV\u20101 gp21 has 3 histidine residues (His348, His365, and His409) positioned in a hydrophobic cavity at the HR1\u2010HR2 interface. At endosomal pH, these histidine residues are protonated and the placement of an unpaired positive charge in a hydrophobic pocket may explain why HTLV\u20101 gp21 is unstable at low pH. Taken together, our results are in excellent agreement with a neutral pH environment being required to mediate the host cell fusion, as low pH entry pathways are not a viable route for HTLV\u20101 entry.",

The CD wavelength scan indicated that the alanine mutations did not change the overall spectral characteristics of the protein, suggesting that the secondary structural elements remained intact. The Tm of the wild\u2010type ASLV TM was 72.4\u00b0C (Fig. 3\nB). Interestingly, alanine mutations to the salt bridge pair that link the HR1 and HR2 helices (Asp464Ala and Lys515Ala) or the ion pair in the CR region (His492Ala and Asp496Ala) had little to no effect on the stability of the protein (\u0394Tm=3.0\u00b0C) (Fig. 3\nB). This finding is in stark contrast to glycoproteins from other retroviruses, such as HTLV\u20101 gp21, XMRV TM, and MPMV TM that have intricate networks of inter\u2010 and intrachain electrostatic interactions in the fusion subunit. Mutations to residues involved in electrostatic interactions between the HR1 and HR2 regions have profound effects (\u0394Tm>30\u00b0C) on fusion protein stability and viral entry (34, unpublished data).",

To our knowledge, no other class I fusion protein has an ion pair at the HR1 trimer interface. Typically, the interactions between HR1\u2010HR1 helices are largely mediated by hydrophobic forces. An alanine mutation to Arg473 resulted in a 10\u00b0C decrease in the apparent Tm compared to wild\u2010type protein, suggesting Arg473 plays a strong role in ASLV TM stability. However, an alanine mutation to Asp468, the ion\u2010pair partner to Arg473, stabilized the fusion protein with a 5\u00b0C increase in melting temperature (Fig. 3\nB). We believe that the increase in the melting temperature is due to the formation of a new salt bridge to Asp507 located on the outer HR2 helix. This new ion pair will stabilize the inner core (HR1) to the outer layer (HR2) of the 6\u2010helix bundle, thus leading to the observed increased Tm. An alanine mutation to Asp507, as expected, did not affect the Tm, indicating that this residue is not involved in stabilizing the fusion protein. We decided to make a double mutation encompassing both Asp468Ala and Asp507Ala. The removal of all the negatively charged partners to Arg473 should decrease the stability of the fusion subunit. However, the Asp468Ala\u2010Asp507Ala double mutant revealed no major changes in apparent Tm compared to wild\u2010type (Fig. 3\nB). This strongly suggests that the HR1\u2010HR1 ion\u2010pair does not play a role in stabilizing the inner trimeric core. Instead, Arg473 is likely involved in stabilizing the HR1\u2010HR2 interface through a network of hydrogen bonds made between Arg473 to Ser471, Ser506, and Ser509 (Fig. 3\nA). Overall, our data suggest that electrostatic interactions between HR1\u2010HR1 and HR1\u2010HR2 regions of the ASLV TM fusion subunit are not critical for the stability of the postfusion 6\u2010helix bundle structure.",

Leu461 is located on HR1 and makes van der Waals interactions with Met519 and Phe516 from HR2. Previous viral entry assays identified that a single alanine mutation to Leu461 significantly hinders the infectivity of the virus (53). The importance of hydrophobic residues in stabilizing the fusion protein is consistent with the nature of the ASLV lifecycle.

His490 is positioned immediately after the HR1 region following a short stretch of hydrophobic residues (FLLLA). The side chain of the His490 faces into the center of the hydrophobic inner trimeric TM core (Fig.\n\n5\n\nA). In contrast, His492 faces out into the solvent and forms an intrachain ion pair with Asp496. To investigate the role of these histidine residues for the postfusion conformation of the protein, we mutated His490 and His492 to alanine residues, and monitored the melting temperatures of the ASLV TM mutants as a function of pH (pH 5.0\u20138.0). Neither His490Ala nor His492Ala had significantly different thermal stabilities from that of the wild\u2010type protein at pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.0 (Fig. 5\nB). However, at pH 5.0, mutation of either His490 or His492 to alanine significantly destabilized the ASLV TM by ~20\u00b0C compared to the wild\u2010type TM. Mutation of His490 had the larger effect on the stability of the protein, decreasing the Tm below 50\u00b0C at pH 5.0, whereas mutation of His492 reduced the melting temperature to 56\u00b0C. Delos et al. (46) previously showed that alanine substitutions to His490 or to His492 did not hinder the membrane association of the TM during the pH\u2010independent, receptor\u2010mediated first step of viral fusion, but inhibited the entry of infectious ASLV particles for complete fusion. Subsequently, their pH profiling studies on CR histidines demonstrated that although His490Ala was not significantly different from wild\u2010type, but His492Ala shifted the pH required for activation by 0.6 pH units (46). Delos et al. (46) suggested that His492 acts as a trigger to release structural constraints on the fusion subunit on encountering a low\u2010pH environment.",

From prefusion and postfusion crystal structures of the EBOV and IAV envelope glycoproteins (24, 26, 54\u201356), it is clear that, on triggering, the HR1 region remodels into a single long \u03b1\u2010helix. As the HR1 \u03b1\u2010helix extends, the alignment of individual dipoles from the carbonyl groups along the helical axis place increasing net positive and negative charges at the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal poles of the helix, respectively (57, 58). The negatively and positively charged helix dipole moments are stabilized by oppositely charged end\u2010capping residues (57, 59, 60). Unbalanced helix dipole moments have been shown to destabilize helical bundles (57, 58, 61). Calculation of the electrostatic potential on the surface of the ASLV TM reveals negatively and positively charged regions at the poles of the 6\u2010helix bundle. At low pH, the ASLV TM histidine residues will have a positive charge and, due to their positions at the base of the central HR1 trimeric helix, are in excellent position to stabilize the negative dipole moment (Fig. 5\nA). It is not clear whether any residues are present that cap the positively charged dipole moment, as most crystal structures lack the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor regions of the fusion subunit.",

To our knowledge, the role of a helix dipole moment on postfusion protein stability has not been investigated for viral class I fusion proteins. Currently, representative models exist in the PDB of viral fusion proteins from viruses that undergo either a pH\u2010dependent or pH\u2010independent entry mechanism. ASLV, LCMV, and IAV are well\u2010characterized viruses that require low pH for activation, whereas retroviruses are prototypical viruses for pH\u2010independent entry (12, 50, 62\u201366). Assessment of these structures revealed that the helix dipole moments of the viral fusion subunits from three different viral families (ASLV, LCMV, and IAV) appear to have a three\u2010 to four\u2010fold larger dipole moment compared to other retroviral (HTLV\u20101, BLV, MoMLV, and HERV\u2010FRD) and filoviral (EBOV and MARV) fusion proteins (Table\n\n2\n). From our analysis, a trend exists where viruses undergoing a pH\u2010dependent activation (ASLV, LCMV, and IAV) have a stronger helix dipole moment than those that enter through a pH\u2010independent mechanism (MoMLV, HERV\u2010FRD, HTLV\u20101, and BLV). The filovirus (EBOV and MARV) GP2 structures are an exception to this helix dipole trend. However, Ebola virus is a rather unique pH\u2010dependent virus. Whereas other pH\u2010dependent viruses utilize the low\u2010pH environment of the endosome to activate its viral glycoprotein for fusion, the low\u2010pH requirement for EBOV entry is linked to the activation of a cellular protease to cleave EBOV GP for fusion (67\u201369). Moreover, the EBOV and MARV GP2 structures are highly similar to the retroviral fusion subunits (Fig. 1\nD). Therefore, while EBOV GP2 is classified as a pH\u2010dependent virus, its viral fusion protein may have characteristics, including its helix dipole properties, more similar to the pH\u2010independent viruses. It has been shown that electrostatic interactions between protonated histidine and a negative helix dipole are more effective at low pH (59).",

Structures of the \u03b2\u2010, \u03b4\u2010, and \u03b3\u2010retroviral fusion subunits reveal a clustering of electrostatic interactions at the HR and CR regions (ref. 34 and unpublished results). The presence of salt bridges on pH\u2010independent viral TMs aligns with the life cycle of retroviruses, as the electrostatic interactions will provide the utmost stability at neutral pH. Biophysical and mutagenic studies revealed that the HR1\u2010HR2 interface and CR regions of these retroviral TMs are strongly stabilized by its electrostatic interactions (unpublished results). Moreover, previous reports showed that the alanine mutations to these residues resulted in melting temperature changes of >30\u00b0C and rendered the virus incapable of entry (34). For instance, Maerz et al. (34) identified a CR region salt bridge (Arg380 and Glu398) on HTLV\u20101 gp21, and an asparagine substitution on Glu398 residue reduced the fusion activity by more than 5\u2010fold compared to wild\u2010type. Similar results were obtained from a previously identified HIV\u20101 salt bridge (Lys574 and Asp632) and inhibitors binding to a hydrophobic pocket that interrupts this salt bridge were shown to hinder the cellular entry of infectious HIV\u20101 particles (71\u201374). As mentioned previously, the ASLV fusion subunit also displays a series of salt bridges between its HR1 and HR2 helices. Despite ASLV being a retrovirus, its fusion protein has evolved to downplay the requirement of these electrostatic interactions on the stability of the postfusion 6\u2010helix bundle. The ASLV HR1\u2010HR2 interface is instead stabilized through hydrophobic interactions, in line with viruses that undergo a low pH\u2010dependent entry. Therefore, viral fusion proteins that mediate entry at the plasma membrane tend to display salt bridges in its HR and CR regions, whereas viruses entering through an endosomal pathway tend to utilize nonionizable hydrophobic residues for stability.",

In ASLV TM, IAV HA2, EBOV GP2 MARV GP2, and LCMV GP2, a histidine residue is present in an outer layer on the fusion protein. In EBOV GP2 and MARV GP2, the outer histidine is conserved structurally with ASLV TM His492, suggesting an important role for the outer histidine. In IAV HA2, the outer histidine (His142) is suggested to act as a pH sensor to trigger conformational changes at low pH (75). Based on the prefusion EBOV GP structure (55), His602 is at the GP1\u2010GP2 interface, thus supporting a role in also activating the glycoprotein for fusion. Histidine residues are ideal low\u2010pH sensors, as the pKa of its imidazole side chain is 6.0. Thus, at the pH of an early or late endosome, histidine residues become protonated to trigger conformational changes. However, in addition to its potential role in conformational changes, the outer layer positive charge may be involved in stabilizing the negative helix dipole moment. Mutation of ASLV TM His492Ala and the addition of a negative charge (His492Glu) decreased the apparent Tm by >20\u00b0C at low pH (Fig. 5\nB), suggesting that the presence of a positive charge on the histidine residue is important for stabilization of the fusion subunit. In contrast, the incorporation of a histidine residue on the outer layer of HTLV\u20101 gp21 (Lys394His), as expected, destabilized the fusion protein at all pH values (Fig. 5\nB). Due to the weak dipole moment of HTLV\u20101 gp21, a protonated histidine residue did not increase the stability at low pH. At pH values >7.0, a neutral histidine residue destabilized the fusion subunit, suggesting that a positive charge in the outer layer is important for postfusion HTLV\u20101 gp21 stability. In summary, the outer layer positive charge may play two roles: triggering the conformational changes for fusion, and stabilizing the negatively charged helix dipole in the postfusion 6\u2010helix bundle.",

In IAV HA2 and ASLV TM, His106 and His490 reside at the base of the HR1 core, respectively. Histidine residues located at the C\u2010terminus of a helix have been commonly shown to interact with a helix dipole to increase protein stability through charge\u2010dipole interactions (57, 59, 60).

The substitution of His490Arg in ASLV TM resulted in maintained thermal stability (Tm>70\u00b0C) over a wide pH range (Fig. 5\nB). Our results show that a positively charged arginine residue can also stabilize the postfusion conformation of viral fusion proteins at low pH. Regardless of the virus and type of amino acid, the positive charge at the base of the helical core can counterbalance the negative helix dipole moment. For the fusion proteins of pH\u2010independent viruses, such as HTLV\u20101 and MoMLV, no inner layer histidine or positively charged residues exist. Given that the pH\u2010independent viral fusion subunits have a smaller negative helix dipole moment, end capping of the helix dipole moment may not be necessary for this class of fusion proteins. In summary, a basic residue is likely required on an inner layer of the HR1 core to counterbalance the negative helix dipole moment and stabilize the postfusion 6\u2010helix bundle for viral fusion proteins that encounter a low pH environment.",

Viruses that require low pH for entry, such as ASLV, IAV, and LCMV, fuse at the endosomal membrane and have strong positive and negative charges at their ends due to its helix dipole moment. Negatively charged helix dipole is stabilized by two layers of positively charged histidine or arginine capping residues (only histidine is shown). In addition, the outer layer of histidine residues may be involved in triggering conformational changes in the prefusion viral glycoprotein on entering a low\u2010pH environment. HR1\u2010HR2 interface is in general mediated by largely hydrophobic interactions. Viruses that undergo a pH\u2010independent entry process, such as retroviruses, fuse at the plasma membrane. The helix dipole moment is decreased, and no histidine or arginine residues are located in the CR region to stabilize the negative helix dipole. Moreover, the HR1\u2010HR2 interface is stabilized with a larger number of electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic forces.",
