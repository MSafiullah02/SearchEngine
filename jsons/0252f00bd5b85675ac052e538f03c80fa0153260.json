As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.",

Most mental health disorders have an onset during adolescence, a time associated with poor helpseeking and access to services [2] setting the scene for longer-term negative outcomes such as adverse mental health and economic outcomes in early adulthood [3] . Schools are aware of students' mental health issues and the lack of readily available interventions; 62% of principals reported being frustrated they could not get help for students with mental health issues and students in lower socio-economic areas were in greater need of support [4] . Providing e-Health interventions has shown to lead to improved emotional wellbeing in general [5] and in school settings [6] . E-Health interventions can provide near-universal reach and access, and potentially appeal to young people concerned about the stigma of using the conventional mental health system. Dialog agent or 'chatbot' style interaction for digital mental health has attracted interest since Eliza in the 1960's and evidence of effectiveness has been demonstrated for the modern system, Woebot [7] .",

RUSH Digital were selected to partner with the university-based team and our community stakeholders to create the chatbot. A hybrid user-centered design / codesign process was used, beginning with scoping interviews of young people and experienced counselors. This was followed by design workshops including young people, counselors, researchers and developers. The resulting design focuses on daily user engagement in key activities over a 4-week intervention program, including: relaxation strategies; problem solving techniques; recognizing and tackling negative thoughts; interpersonal and communication skills, using a gratitude journal; and scheduling positive activities. While Headstrong is fundamentally text dialog based, avatars were designed (see figure 1 ) to make the chat agent relatable. The avatars are rendered as young people slightly older and more experienced than the intended users, and giving a choice of gender and ethnicity representative of the target population. These avatars appear in various poses during the chat, such as providing a 'selfie' when initially building rapport with the user and with various expressions as appropriate to the messages in the activities.

Such solutions are well suited to limited question-answering type help chatbots often employed in businesses, but configuring and managing (and visualizing) large amounts of content quickly becomes untenable. Implementing the Headstrong design required dialog encompassing more than 20 distinct activities each of which engages the user for 5-10 minutes. Such a rule-based dialog graph contains thousands of dialog nodes. We needed an architecture that facilitates managing this amount of content. Further, to streamline the knowledge engineering process, and to provide ease of adaptation for differing audiences and uses, authoring of dialog content should be possible by users without technical expertise. We wanted enhanced functionality within the conversational channel such as media or minigames; and for research requirements, we needed detailed but ethical tracking of chatbot usage. Figure 2 illustrates the Headstrong architecture. Facebook Messenger was selected as the front-end so the chatbot could engage young people with a familiar interface likely to be already installed on their phones. The Headstrong server leverages existing components RUSH Digital had deployed to other industries, and uses Dialogflow for matching user input to intents. It interfaces to the HABITs digital platform [8] to record usage data for research. The browser-based interface for dialog authoring is described in the next section. ",

Node types are color-coded and dragged down from a toolbar into a working canvas. For example, Figure 3 includes a condition-checking node (pink), with conditions along each branch (beige), a question node (green) with quick reply options (beige) and two modules (lime). The '+' icon on the lower-right of some nodes can be clicked to add conditions or options to the parent node. The resulting graph is a logical flow diagram, intuitive to non-technical users. There remain aspects of dialog authoring that are too challenging for non-technical users. One such example is configuring an appropriate chatbot introduction based on whether the chatbot is responding to unprompted user engagement, or handling a response from chatbot prompted engagement; and at the same time making appropriate reference to any important prior user state, such as whether the user had expressed distress and triggered the emergency escalation module during the prior engagement. This use case requires defining and managing user variables and setting up conditional branches to a degree that is generally just beyond the purview of a non-technical user.",

Each day ends with a choice of a motivational quote, joke, or an entry into a gratitude journal.

Reused content constituted roughly one half of \"21-Day Stress Detox\". The novel dialog content was almost completely authored by the psychology Masters student in under 2 months. This required an initial 2-hour teaching session by a software developer, followed by two further sessions to build on the first session and troubleshoot any issues.

The overall conversation design was newly created, tailored to support expected one-off user-driven engagement with Aroha, hence differing from the conversation design for Headstrong and 21-Day Stress Detox. Some content (i.e. gratitude journaling, minigames, meditation) from those two projects was re-used through module duplication, with minor context-sensitive modification to the dialog. The main new content for Aroha was developed by two experienced clinical psychologists over one weekend before lockdown in New Zealand. Dialog refinement, testing and implementation of feedback took place over 10 days and then a clinical trial begun.",

In contrast, the performance of XiaoIce, a social chatbot emphasizing emotional connection that has communicated with over 660 million active users [10] , shows that deep learning can be successfully applied to dialog. An outstanding challenge is integrating expert-crafted dialog with the engagement capability of deep-learning based systems in a single e-therapy agent. We believe there are possibilities in the medium-term including machine learning of dialog policy (e.g. sequencing activities) and use of deep-learnt dialog for rapport building and discovery while retaining crafted dialog for evidence-based activities. Integrating such deep learning-based capabilities is a key direction for development of the architecture with the objective of achieving longer retention in evidence-based programs.",
