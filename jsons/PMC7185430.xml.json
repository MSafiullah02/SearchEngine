Acute RTIs are also the leading cause of missed days of service among military conscripts. Annually approximately 27 000 conscripts are trained in Finland. In 2007 in the garrisons around Finland, over 25 000 upper RTI cases, 4300 maxillary sinus infections, and 1300 middle ear infections were diagnosed [1]. Moreover, approximately 1500 cases of bronchitis and 800 pneumonias were reported [1]. Military trainees are especially at high risk for epidemics of respiratory infection due to the crowded living conditions in barracks, environmental factors, and physical stress related to military training [2].",

Moreover, combination of L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis BB-12 have reduced the risk or the duration of RTIs in children and in young adults [12], [13]. The most convincing results of the effectiveness of probiotics in virus infections are studies of specific probiotics in alleviating the duration and severity of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis [14]. In respiratory virus infections, however, there are only few implications that probiotics may reduce viral occurrence in the nasopharynx [11], [15], [16].",

This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the Ethics Committee of Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District.

Originally, a total of 982 healthy adults aged 18\u201328 years (mean 19.3 years), who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Kalima et al., manuscript), were enrolled in the study from two intakes of conscripts in July 2012 (recruits) and in the end of the October 2012 (reserve officer candidates). Conscripts were randomized to receive either one chewing tablet (Orion Pharma Ltd., Espoo, Finland) containing 37.3% xylitol, 37.3% sorbitol, 7.5% microfibrous cellulose, 3.0% magnesium stearate, and 1.9% citrus flavor (n\n = 50.2%; control group), or the same tablet with 5 \u00d7 109\n CFU of L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) and 2 \u00d7 109\n CFU of B. animalis ssp. lactis (DSM 15954; Chr.

During the intervention, whenever the conscripts suffered from upper RTI symptoms and sought treatment from the garrisons healthcare center, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected by a flocked-tip nylon swab (Copan, Diagnostics Murrieta, CA, USA) inserted into the nasopharynx through the nose. The swabs were placed immediately into a vial containing 3 mL universal transport medium (UTM-RT, Copan, Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA), and then stored at \u221270 \u00b0C.",

Picornaviruses, in particular rhinoviruses, were the most common agents found in symptomatic conscripts. Probiotics did not decrease the total number of picornaviruses either in military recruits or in reserve officer candidates. However, the results showed that military recruits receiving probiotics had significantly fewer picornaviruses, after 3 months of intervention in September. The reducing effect was not observed in other months studied or in other viruses either in military recruits or in reserve officer candidates. The findings are possibly explained by the fact that conscripts were enrolled in the study in different months (July vs. end of October) and therefore different respiratory viruses were circulating in the population due to seasonal variation. In addition, probiotic's picornavirus reducing effect after 3 months of intervention imply that in order for probiotic to be effective, sufficient \u201cpriming time\u201d is required. In otitis-prone children, probiotic combination was also able to reduce human bocavirus load after 3 months [15]. The reason why reducing effect was not observed in other viruses may be that different probiotic strains may have diverse antiviral mechanisms.",

In healthy children attending day care, children receiving L. rhamnosus GG in milk seemed to have fewer influenza virus A in the upper respiratory tract, although the difference was not statistically significant between the probiotic and the control group [16]. In otitis-prone children, combination of probiotics, including L. rhamnosus GG, reduced significantly the nasopharyngeal presence of human bocavirus DNA [15].

Probiotics may also hinder the absorption of rhinovirus to a host cell via binding to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1. For instance, in macrophage cell culture L. rhamnosus LC705 prevented influenza A virus replication and production of viral proteins by inducing type I interferon-dependent gene activation [21]. In mice, L. rhamnosus GG protected from influenza A virus infection by enhancing respiratory cell-mediated immune responses (interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1), which up-regulated lung natural killer cells [22]. In rats with endotoxin-induced intestinal damage, Bifidobacterium infantis decreased the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [23].

We found divergences between PCR-detection of picornaviruses by xTAG respiratory virus panel assay and RVs and EVs by separate screening assays. This could be partly explained by the fact that utilized PCR assays are targeted for different gene regions. In addition, it is possible that natural isolates of EV cross-react with the non-coding region-targeting primers and probe used in RV-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, and vice versa, possibly affecting the results [18], [24]. The final identification between RV and EV isolates should be executed via molecular typing of the capsid coding genes VP4-VP2 and VP1, respectively.

In the present study, RVs were detected in each month from July to January, with peak occurrence in July. This result was interesting in light of previous reports, where the peak prevalence of RV infections in the Northern hemisphere occurred in autumn and in spring [26]. However, RV infections have also been detected in July in the Finnish military in another study, although the detection rate was much lower than in our study [18]. The finding in the present study may reflect the fact that as large cohort of military recruits enter simultaneously to the semi-closed environment of a garrison, the infections spread rapidly due to high infection pressure. However, typing data to proof that there was an outbreak of RV infection caused by a small number of RV types during the recruitment period in July would be necessary. In contrast to picornaviruses, adenoviruses and influenza viruses, which are found commonly among military conscripts [27], [28], [29], occurred in the present study much lower prevalence. It should be noticed, however, that the results of the viral findings are slightly biased as the number of collected nasopharyngeal samples gradually decreased toward the end of the study due to the discontinuation of conscripts in the intervention trial [Kalima et al., manuscript]. On the influenza season 2012\u20132013 in Finland, the season peaked between January 2013 and March 2013 and therefore, the majority of these infections were missed in the present study.",
