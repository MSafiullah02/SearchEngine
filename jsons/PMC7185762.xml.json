Similarly, poliomyelitis has been a cause of paralytic disease since ancient times [1]. Fortunately, effective vaccines have been developed for both these diseases. Vaccines led to the eradication of smallpox in 1979 [2], and seem likely to achieve the eradication of wild-type poliomyelitis in the not-too-distant future [3].",

Thus, despite the fact that 40 million people are currently living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (UNAIDS/WHO 2003 estimate), no prophylactic vaccine is available to break the cycle of new infections. Similarly, no vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is estimated to infect 170,000,000 people worldwide [4], leading to millions of deaths due to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine is available to prevent infections with herpes simplex virus type 2, which affect one in five Americans [5]. In fact, much effort has been expended in attempts to develop vaccines for these diseases, with a notable lack of success. It might be argued that the \u201ceasy\u201d viral candidates for vaccine development have been exhausted. Viruses such as HCV and HIV pose a unique challenge due to their rapid antigenic variation, while other viruses such as the herpes simplex viruses have potent immune escape mechanisms, including the establishment of lifelong latency. Thus, the development of new vaccines for such viruses is likely to be a slow and laborious process. Together with the increased awareness of emerging viral agents such as West Nile Virus, the SARS coronavirus, and Ebola, the tortuous path to new vaccines is a sobering prospect. Fortunately, another path to the management of viral infections has opened with the development of specific antiviral compounds. The advent of these compounds has allowed effective management of some viral diseases, such as herpesvirus infections and HIV infection (AIDS), and has even made possible the cure of some viral infections such as HCV.",

Although not the first antibacterial, the introduction of penicillin into clinical use was in many ways a watershed event, in that it demonstrated the power of therapy specifically directed at an infectious agent. The development of other effective antibacterials progressed rapidly, but little progress was made against viruses. In fact, a prevailing notion was that viruses, which commandeer the life processes of the cell itself, would not be susceptible to the kinds of attack that had proved so effective against bacteria.

Yearly, numerous compounds are synthesized on a random basis by structural alteration of known cellular inhibitors.

As noted above, in the 1960s and 1970s a large number of nucleoside analogs were developed and screened for antineoplastic and antiviral activity. Some of these, such as 5\u2032-iodo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (IDU) and trifluorothymidine (TFT), came into use for topical treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. Unfortunately, these compounds were unacceptably toxic for systemic use [7]. Another of these so-called \u201cfirst generation\u201d antiherpetics, vidarabine (Ara-A), was sufficiently well-tolerated for systemic therapy, and found use in herpes encephalitis, neonatal herpes, and varicella zoster infections [8], [9], [10].

Thus, the search continued for compounds with true selectivity for virus-infected cells. The culmination of these efforts resulted in the synthesis of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine. In this guanine derivative, the 9 position is replaced by a acyclic side chain. Originally termed acycloguanoside, the compound which would come to be known as acyclovir has become the standard of treatment for alpha-herpesvirus infections. Acyclovir is converted to a monophosphate by a virus-encoded thymidine kinase, and subsequently converted to di- and tri-phosphates by cellular kinases [11]. In contrast, in the uninfected cell, the lack of the viral thymidine kinase prevents generation of the triphosphate form. In the infected cell, the triphosphate form is incorporated into the viral growing viral DNA chain, leading to chain termination. Acyclovir also directly inhibits the viral DNA polymerase, 10\u201330 times more effectively than it does the cellular polymerase [11]. Thus, acyclovir has a high degree of viral selectivity, and is a remarkably well-tolerated drug.",

After demonstration of activity in an animal model [12], the drug was used in immunosuppressed patients with cutaneous or systemic herpes simplex infections, with remarkable efficacy and lack of toxicity [13]. It has subsequently become a mainstay of therapy of genital herpes simplex virus infections, in which it shortens the time to lesion healing and shortens the period of viral shedding [14]. Acyclovir remains an important compound in the treatment of alpha-herpesvirus infections; in 2003 over 9000 scientific and medical articles were published regarding acyclovir and its use. Acyclovir has also given rise to related compounds such as valaciclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, which feature slightly different spectra of antiviral activity and/or improved pharmacodynamics. Unfortunately, these compounds do not eradicate latent virus, and in immunocompetent people the treatment of recurrent lesions provides only a modest clinical benefit. These compounds can used as suppressive therapy over the long term to prevent viral reactivation [15], [16], but once the drug is stopped, reactivation of the virus resumes. Clearly, treatment options that reduce the frequency of clinical recurrences and viral shedding are badly needed.",

Because it emerged relatively recently, a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes of viral replication was available at the start of the initial pharmacologic attacks on HIV. HIV is a retrovirus, and therefore its lifecycle requires the unique reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA, through the action of a viral reverse transcriptase (RT). Because mammalian cells do not encode a reverse transcriptase, this offered an attractive target for therapeutics that might be expected to be relatively non-toxic. The first successful attempts at targeting the HIV RT were compounds analogous to acyclovir, in that they were nucleoside analogs. The first of this class of drugs, known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was AZT [17], [18], which had remarkable efficacy in patients with advanced AIDS [19]. AZT has a 100-fold higher affinity for the viral RT than it does for the cellular polymerases, and thus selectively inhibits RT function [18]. The NRTIs have been a highly successful class of anti-HIV compounds; as of 2004, 9 had been approved by the FDA, and several more are in late-stage development.",

To make matters worse, many of the resistant viruses in fact showed significant cross-resistance to other NRTIs.

Again, what made the difference was the enormous body of basic knowledge regarding the replication of HIV. Several steps in the viral replication cycle made attractive targets, in that they were processes quite distinct from the processes necessary for the life of the normal uninfected human cell. Another target to be attacked was the viral protease, via the so-called protease inhibitors. In the replication cycle of HIV, translation of the coding RNA strand leads to production of a single polypeptide. This polypeptide must be cleaved by the HIV protease to generate the functional proteins required for viral replication. Without this cleavage, viral replication ceases. The first protease inhibitor drug approved for HIV, saquinavir, was introduced in 1995. The impact of this class of compounds was immediate and dramatic [22]. Since the protease inhibitors target a completely different aspect of the viral replication cycle than do the NRTIs, cross-resistance is a relatively infrequent occurrence. Using combinations of NRTIs and protease inhibitors, many patients near death experienced dramatic improvements, with viral loads often falling below the limit of detection [23]. Such combination therapy regimens have come to be known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and the introduction of HAART regimens have made HIV infection a chronic condition that can be managed successfully for years in many patients. Currently, there are 9 protease inhibitors available for HIV infection, and others are in development.",

Therefore other, non-nucleoside drugs were sought that could inhibit RT function. The first of these non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to be clinically approved was nevirapine. The NNRTIs function by binding the hydrophobic pocket of the p66 subunit of the HIV RT [24]. The NNRTIs have become an extremely important part of the anti-HIV armamentarium for several reasons. Like the NRTIs, the NNRTIs are extremely effective drugs, due to the central role played by the viral RT during HIV replication. However, since they attack the HIV RT by a completely different mechanism, cross-resistance between the NNRTIs and the NRTIs is rare. In fact, a number of effective HAART regimens have been described that combine NRTIs and NNRTIs without the need for protease inhibitors [25]. Another attractive feature of the NNRTIs is that their toxicity profiles are quite different from the protease inhibitors. Despite the dramatic efficacy of protease inhibitor-containing HAART regimens, the long-term use of protease inhibitors has been associated with abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism, and changes in body shape [26]. For patients experiencing such side effects, the ability to halt protease inhibitors while maintaining viral control is critical. In addition, having multiple classes of drugs from which to choose is advantageous in patients treated for extended periods who eventually develop resistance to previously effective drugs.",

The first of this class of compounds, the fusion inhibitors, was recently approved by the FDA for clinical use. This compound, originally known as T-20 and now named enfuvirtide, consists of a 36 amino acid polypeptide that is identical to a portion of the HIV surface protein gp41. The gp41 protein is critical for the fusion process, during which it is released from a high-energy configuration after binding of gp120 to its receptors [27]. Enfuvirtide interferes with this process, thus preventing the infection of new cells by HIV. Since it uses a completely different mechanism of action than the other classes of anti-HIV drugs, enfuvirtide is especially useful in treatment-experienced patients with virus resistant to other classes of drugs [28]. An important limitation of enfuvirtide in clinical practice, however, is the fact that because of its composition as a peptide, the drug is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore must be administered by injection. The concept of fusion inhibitors as a class of compounds remains attractive, however, and will be even more so if orally available drugs are developed.",

At best, about 25% of patients treated with a 12-month or longer course of interferon-\u03b1 achieved a sustained viral response; that is, they remained without detectable virus six months after completion of therapy [33]. Subsequently, interferon-\u03b1 was combined with ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside with antiviral activity of unknown mechanism. This regimen increased the rate of sustained viral responses to about 50% [34]. A recent advance has been the development of pegylated forms of interferon-\u03b1. In these forms, interferon-a is covalently conjugated to monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG). This form has a greatly increased half-life compared to the standard preparations, allowing less-frequent injections and avoiding periods of subtherapeutic blood levels of interferon-\u03b1. Large studies have recently been completed evaluating 6 to 12 months of combination therapy with pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin; the sustained viral response rates in these studies approached 60% [35], [36].",

The most successful attempt in this regard is the immune response modifier imiquimod. Imiquimod is an imidazoquinoline derivative that stimulates multiple aspects of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Specifically, imiquimod induces multiple cytokines of the so-called T-helper type 1 (Th1) response, including interferon-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [46]. A similar Th1 response is seen in spontaneously regressing warts [47]. Although the molecular mechanism for these effects was initially unknown, it was later demonstrated that imiquimod stimulates the Th1-type response via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). The TLRs are a family of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, and form the basis for detection of danger by the innate immune system [48]. TLRs are highly expressed in dendritic cells and other professional antigen presenting cells, and ligation of these receptors can strongly promote maturation and cytokine production by other cells of the immune system. Signaling via TLR7 after administration of imiquimod, specifically, results in generation of a vigorous Th1-type response.",

One potentially important agent, resiquimod, is structually related to imiquimod. Resiquimod also acts via an effect on TLRs, specifically TLR7 and TLR8 [55], [56]. Resiquimod has shown some activity in suppressing recurrences of herpes simplex virus infection; in one study the mean time between recurrences of lesions was 169 days in resiquimod-treated patients, compared to 57 days in vehicle-treated patients [57]. The indications for immune response modulators may also extend beyond infectious diseases. Imiquimod has shown significant activity against basal cell carcinoma [58].",

Certainly there is much still to be done before treatment for HSV, HIV, HCV and HPV is considered adequate. Furthermore, the emergence of viruses such as West Nile virus, the SARS coronavirus, and Ebola suggests that new challenges will continue to arise. Fortunately, our ever-increasing understanding of viral replication, together with advances in cell biology and immunology, provide us a good basis for the development of new and more effective therapies to meet these threats.",
