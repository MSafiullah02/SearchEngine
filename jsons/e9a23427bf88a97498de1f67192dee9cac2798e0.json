            "text": "B reast cancer survivors (BCSs) who initiate adjuvant therapy with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) experience various genitourinary signs and symptoms associated with menopausal stage. This clinical condition, currently encompassed within the term ''genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM),'' are mainly attributed to vulvovaginal atrophy and include genital (ie dryness, burning, and irritation), sexual (ie, lack of lubrication, discomfort, and pain), and urinary problems (ie, urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections). 1, 2 Intense estrogen deprivation associated with NSAI therapy increases the severity of GSM symptoms, which negatively impact patients' quality of life and may consequently compromise their compliance with adjuvant endocrine therapy. [2] [3] [4] Symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy appear in 50% to 75% of BCSs, the most common being vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. [5] [6] [7] To alleviate these and other vulvovaginal symptoms such as itching and burning, vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are recommended as first-line therapy. 2, 4 However, these products only provide temporary symptomatic relief, and do not restore the normal function of vaginal tissue. 2, 4, 8 Conversely, local hormonal treatments have proven efficacy in reversing vulvovaginal atrophy associated with estrogen depletion, although their use in BCSs is controversial due to the risk of increasing estrogen levels. 4, 8, 9 In this regard, low-dose local estrogen treatments are considered to have a lower risk profile compared to standard doses and have shown efficacy in several studies in BCSs. 10, 11 Among the variety of local treatments, ultra-low dose of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel has shown a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile (ie, a negligible increase of serum estriol levels after three weeks of daily use) and efficacy in reversing vulvovaginal symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women after 12 weeks of treatment. 12, 13 Estriol is a final metabolite unable to convert back to other estrogenic precursors, and has low binding affinity to the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, estriol displays preferential affinity to b (urogenital) rather than a (breast) estrogen receptors. Compared with estradiol, estriol is a less potent hormone with lower estrogenic potential 14 ; yet, clinical studies indicate a similar effectiveness of both agents in controlling GSM symptoms. 4, 8, 15, 16 Even though low-dose estrogen-based vaginal preparations are widely used, scientific evidence regarding their safety and efficacy in women with breast cancer receiving NSAI treatment is still scarce, and the need for placebo-controlled randomized trials in this setting has been highlighted. 14, 17, 18 Given that NSAIs are a mainstay of endocrine adjuvant treatment for breast cancer survivors, further clinical research is needed to establish guidelines to treat its associated side effects. 4, 8, 9, 11 In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of an ultra-low dose of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women treated with NSAIs under the hypothesis that its application is effective in the management of vulvovaginal symptoms without a significant impact on serum gonadotropins and plasma estrogens.",

The study included postmenopausal women with hormone receptorpositive (and any HER2 status) early breast cancer (stage I-IIIA) who had been treated with NSAI (ie, either anastrozole or letrozole) for at least six months. Participants were recruited from five Spanish sites and one Swedish site during a routine follow-up visit between April 2015 and October 2016. Postmenopausal status was defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels greater than 40 mIU/mL, or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. All patients had moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness according to the FDA guidelines for drug development in postmenopausal women (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER January 2003). A moderate symptom was considered if the symptom was present, bothersome and annoying, and a severe symptom was considered if the symptom was present, bothersome and annoying, and interfered with the normal activity. Other inclusion criteria were a score 0 or 1 in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG), and an adequate bone marrow and organ function. Patients treated with another antitumoral therapy (excluding pamidronate or alendronate) and those who received vulvovaginal treatment in the 15 days before the study start, and/or had used hormones, natural (phytoestrogens) or herbal products to treat menopausal symptoms in the 3 months before the study start were excluded from the study. Other important exclusion criteria included the presence of postmenopausal uterine bleeding, vaginal bleeding of unknown etiology, and endometrial thickness greater than or equal to 4 mm; and history of other malignancy within 5 years of study entry (aside from nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix adequately treated), thromboembolic disease or coagulopathies, severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease in the previous 6 months, renal impairment, Hepatitis B and/or C (with the exception of patients with normal hepatic function), and HIV infection. Patients who had received any investigational treatment for any condition or had participated in any clinical trial within 4 weeks of inclusion date were excluded from the study. All patients signed the written informed consent before starting the treatment, and the study protocol was approved by the Regulatory Authorities and applicable Ethics Committees of the participating countries.",

Given that the 0.005% estriol gel is formulated as a highly hydrating gel with a true effect beyond the pure placebo effect, treatment with the gel alone (without hormones) was expected to have an effect on some of the symptoms and signs (ie temporal relief of vaginal dryness), similar to the lubricants and moisturizers indicated as first-line treatment for vaginal atrophy. 2, 4, 8 Nevertheless, patients in the active arm experienced a greater improvement in vaginal dryness throughout the follow-up, likely due to the stimulation of maturation of the vaginal epithelium by the active hormone and its healing effect. Regarding sexual function, only the 0.005% estriol gel improved most domains and the total score of the FSFI questionnaire, whereas the placebo hydrating gel failed to improve sexual function. Given the predominant impact of NSAIs treatment on sexual function and consequently, wellbeing and quality of life, these findings suggest that the ultralow 0.005% estriol vaginal gel may improve patients' quality of life in addition to alleviating GSM symptoms. 25 Although studies with local estrogens in BCSs receiving NSAIs are scarce, the efficacy of local estrogen treatment, such as low-dose estriol, in alleviating symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy in healthy postmenopausal women is well documented. 26 In this regard, a previous pivotal phase III placebo-controlled study including 167 women reported efficacy of the 0.005% estriol ultra-low dose vaginal gel. 12 ",

In spite of the randomized placebo-controlled nature of this trial, our analysis was constrained to a 12-week follow-up, thus precluding long-term assessment of the effects of estriol. Some authors have reported an increased absorption in atrophic compared to estrogenized vaginal tissues and a differential expression of estrogen receptors in the vaginal walls of pre-and post-menopausal women. 27, 28 Although these observations likely rule out increased absorption of estriol by the well estrogenized epithelium and, consequently, safety concerns after prolonged treatment, long-term studies may be needed to assess the sustained safety and effectivity throughout the prescribed adjuvant treatment. It is also worth mentioning that the scarcity of previous data regarding the change of FSH in patients treated with estriol vaginal gels precluded a formal estimation of sample size; however, the results of a previous analysis of FSH change in these patients suggested that the size of our sample should be large enough to identify significant changes in FSH levels. 24 Given that our results indicate that the 0.005% estriol gel preparation is effective and safe, further studies using a larger sample size (with a balanced randomization) to assess long-term effects are warranted.",
