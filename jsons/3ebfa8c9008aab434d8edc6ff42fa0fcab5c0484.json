In burn patients, potential biomarkers can be used clinically to identify infections and sepsis; they can also be used to predict the survival of injuries, monitor the severity of injuries, organ function or wound healing. There are several risk factors which facilitate microbial colonization and infection, including age and comorbidities, burn wound size, impaired immunity (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypermetabolic response), and medical measures (e.g., use of invasive catheters, transfusion, delays in burn wound excision) etc. [1, 2] . The microbial colonizers or pathogens affecting burn patients include bacteria and fungi [3, 4] . The most common Gram-positive bacteria implicated in burn wound infections include Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A. Among that group, Staphylococcus aureus continues to be one of the most important bacterial cause of burn wound infections [4] [5] [6] [7] . The most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria from patients with burn wounds include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae [1, 2, 5, 7, 8] .",

Mean LOS before the first isolated MDRO (n = 23) was 17.7 \u00b1 16 days. In total, 17 (45.9%) cases developed HAI with 40 episodes.

One case (70% TBSA and 49% third-degree burns) died with Baux score of 31 points, 4 months after admission. Table 3 lists the distribution of microbial isolates by TBSA and by days after admission. Out of 1132 clinical specimens, 706 were positive in cultures (62.4%). A total of 335 strains of bacteria were isolated in the study. The three most commonly isolated groups of microorganisms were Gram-negative bacilli (GNB, n = 178, 53.1%) including glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (GNFGNB, n = 132, 39.4%); Gram-positive bacteria (n = 101, 30.2%) including Gram-positive cocci (GPC, n = 97, 29%); and fungus (n = 51, 15.2%). The most commonly isolated species include Staphylococcus spp. (n = 75, 22.4%), Acinetobacter spp. (n = 63, 18.8%), and yeast (n = 45, 13.4%). In addition, only 1.2% (n = 4) of anaerobes were isolated. The MDRO accounted for 31% of all microbial isolates. The isolated MDROs began to increase in patients with TBSA \u226550% and hospitalization \u226515 days. The most commonly isolated MDRO include carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB, 14.6% [imipenem-resistant 10.7% and pandrug-resistant 3.9%]); MRSA (11.3%); and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP, 2.4%). In addition, pandrugresistant P. aeruginosa (PDRPA, 0.3%) was isolated from one case of more than 70% TBSA and hospitalized for more than 31 days. Figure 1 and Table 3 shows the trends in distribution of microbial isolates by TBSA. Overall, the total number of microbial isolates gradually increased with the increase in TBSA (p < 0.001). The OR peaked at 70-79%TBSA (18.35), before declining to 12.45 at 80-89% TBSA. The decline in OR slowed to 10.54 at more than 90% TBSA. At 39% or less TBSA, significant change was observed for GPC (p = 0.027), however the OR decreased with increasing TBSA and maintained between 0.17-0.31. Gram-positive bacilli isolates (only 4 strains) first appeared at 50-59% TBSA, the OR also decreased with increasing TBSA (p = 0.014). Figure 2 indicate the trends in microbial isolation by days after admission. Overall, the total number of microbial isolates gradually increased with the increase in the hospitalization days (p < 0.001). The OR (4.50) of microbial isolates increased markedly in 15-30 hospitalization days and the OR (9.80) reached peak at 31 hospitalization days or more. Gram-positive bacilli showed statistically significant change (p < 0.001), which was the highest in 1-3 hospitalization days, but the OR of isolates decreased with increasing hospitalization days. For all other microbial isolates, such as GPC, GNB, GNFGNB, anaerobes and fungi, no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) in OR trends was observed. The OR (6.82) of the fungal isolates reached the highest at 4-7 hospitalization days, followed by a slight decrease but remained stable (3.05-5.69) thereafter.",

However, the results from this study differed from previously published reports. We found the most commonly isolated group was GNB (53.1%). Among GNB, the most commonly isolated subgroup was GNFGNB (39.4%). This difference could be attributed to differences in the type of burns, populations, age distribution, and data analysis period. However, the most common bacteria isolated in this study were Acinetobacter Enterococcus s p . spp. and P. aeruginosa, which is consistent with a majority of other published reports [1, 2, 7, 9] . Interestingly, those two bacteria along with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were isolated within 3 days of hospitalization. One study on similar population affected by dust explosion but where patients were transmitted to other hospitals for treatment, found that Ralstonia pickettii (18.5%) was one of the most common bacteria causing BSIs [20] . These bacteria survive easily in sewage or humid environments. Among MDRO, Gram-positive bacteria particularly MRSA continues to be an important pathogen in burn infections [1, 4] . Our data showed lower frequency of isolation by S. aureus (11.3%) compared to MRSA (95%). MRSA cases showed TBSA of more than 40% and were hospitalized for more than 15 days. This result was in contradiction with another study that monitored all hospitalized burn patients for 1 year and found only 16.7% S. aureus strains resistant to methicillin. However, burn patients in that study merely had a median TBSA of 7% (interquartile range 4-14%) and a median hospital stay of 14 days [7] . Apart from MRSA, care and treatment of burn patients infected with VRE has also become increasingly challenging. Isolation rate of VRE in the present study was low (2.1%). The reason could be younger healthy population enrolled in the present study coupled with proper antibiotic management and infection control.",

Due to the fact that subjects in this study belonged to a young and homogeneous group, of particular interest to us was the influence of both burn severity and time factor on the types of microbial isolates. Several multivariate analyses of prospective or retrospective studies have revealed that the degree of burn wounds was a major risk factor for microbial colonization and infection [1, 5, 7, 26] . Compared to \u226419% of TBSA, patients with greater than 20% of TBSA were more than twice (RR 2.09-2.41) likely to be infected at a rate that was five times faster [7] . Several studies revealed that patients with TBSA range greater than 25% or greater than 30% had a high risk of microbial infection, because these patients usually need to use invasive devices for treatment [4, 26] . One report suggested that infection rates rose by an increase in TBSA of burn; they observed infection rates of 18, 30 and 52% in OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, HR hazards ratio patients with 15-30%, 31-50% and 51-69% of TBSA respectively [5] . In the present study, patients with severe burns cases had the average TBSA of 46.1%; however, infection rates for patients with greater than 50% TBSA rose by 56.8%. Unexpectedly, our data showed the number of isolated GPC were the highest in patients with less than 39% TBSA, and the proportion of isolated GPC showed a downward trend (p = 0.027) with the increase in TBSA extent. However, in terms of overall isolated microorganisms, our data were consistent with previously published reports [1, 5, 7] . We found an upward trend (p < 0.001) in the proportion of overall microbial isolates over time, until the TBSA reached 79%. Afterwards, the trend stabilized followed by a decline. In general, the risk of death of patients with severe burns was relatively high and rapid, so overall isolated microbial maybe thereby reduced. However, our data could not confirm this statement due to death in only one case (70% TBSA). In terms of the overall MDRO, we also used regression analyses approach to adjust the depth of burns, the likelihood of infections by MDRO increased by 2.58-17.57 times for each 10% increase in TBSA.",

One report indicated that the thirddegree burns would significantly influence (HR 7.88) the burn wound infection. They concluded that risk of infection for patients with third-degree burns almost doubled and patients got infected at a faster rate [7] . Another study using multiple analysis revealed that only the third-degree burn (OR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.19, p = 0.012) was an independent risk factor [23] . Using univariable analysis, our results demonstrated significantly higher likelihood of MDRO infections (1.14-1.79 times) for every 10% increase in the third-degree burn severity. However, when the multiple analyses were used after adjusted TBSA variable, the risk of MDRO was reduced by 47-74%. This may be linked to early excision, debridement and grafting, use special materials dressings to treatment, as well as appropriate antibiotic use and infection control, which could reduce the risk of MDRO and cross-contamination in patients with deep burns.",

Recently one study showed that the overwhelming majority of bloodstream pathogens were GNB isolates typically isolated within 2 weeks after the burn. During 15-28 days after burn, A. baumannii was the most common causative pathogen, while Chryseobacterium spp., S. maltophilia, and R. mannitolilytica were most frequently isolated early (mean: 14.5 days) after the burn [24] . The proportion of the overall microbial isolates in this study showed a significant change in trend over time; in particular, hospitalization for more than 14 days (OR 4.5-9.8, p < 0.001). Our findings correlated well with previous studies with reference to isolation of GPBs; nearly a half of them (only 4 strains) were isolated within 3 days of hospitalization, before showing downward trend (p < 0.001). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the trend for the proportion of GNFGNB isolation (p = 0.299), with Acinetobacter spp. (71.4%) and P. aeruginosa (84.8%) being two major groups isolated at 15 or more days after hospitalization.",

The cases had homogeneity including patient age, medical treatment and care, and environmental setting factors. Therefore, our results successfully demonstrated the trends in microbial isolation and important factors that govern the rate of isolation. Second, the dispersion of the patients in different 5 ICUs and burn ward might cause some heterogeneity of the sampling. However, an interdisciplinary medical team was quickly established and held regular meetings on treatment and disposal strategies to achieve consensus and consistency. Third, this manuscript was mainly based on recommended of the US CDC's definition of burn infection, including changes in the appearance or characteristics of burn wound. Burn injury could result in severe sepsis and septic shock; however, our database could not display the data.",
