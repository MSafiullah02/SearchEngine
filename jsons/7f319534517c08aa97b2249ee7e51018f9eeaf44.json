In a meta-analysis, the overall pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.0% (Desai et al., 2020) . Preliminary data did not clarify whether cancer patients were at higher risk of contracting the virus compared to the general population, nor did they elucidate risk factors for developing the most severe form of the disease. However, these data did suggest the population most at risk of death from COVID-19 was those affected by cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension as well as older age, male gender, and obesity, which collectively corresponds to a common prototype seen with a co-existent lung cancer diagnosis. Notably, a recent publication of 218 patients from Montefiore Health system in the United States reported that cancer patients with COVID-19 had a greater risk of death compared to non-cancer patients, as well as a 55% (6/11) mortality rate specific to lung cancer (Mehta et al., 2020) . Albeit with small numbers (n = 22), a publication from China suggested that lung cancer patients had the second-highest risk of developing severe and critical symptoms, ICU admission, and death behind hematological malignancies (Dai et al., 2020) .",

Markedly increased hypercoagulable profiles due to hyperfibrinogenemia were reported in a series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU for ARDS, leading to recommendations regarding prophylactic anticoagulation in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (Ranucci et al., 2020) .
