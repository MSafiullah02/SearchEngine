Specimens were collected into a sterile container via closed circuit, in-line catheter suction of respiratory secretions from the endotracheal tube (ET), as part of routine clinical care. Swabs were then dropped into vials containing PBS or VTM and transported to the RUCDR laboratory for analysis. To test intra-and inter-patient variation in efficacy of detecting SARS-CoV2 from ET-derived samples, three experimental procedures were performed. Eight samples from two subjects (four from each subject) were harvested at the same time and transported in either VTM or PBS. Samples were processed immediately (at 0 hours) or after 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Real time-qPCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on 1 sample from each transport medium at each incubation time (0 or 2 hours) and Ct values for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), open reading frame 1ab ORF1ab, and spike protein (S) genes were compared; bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) spiked into the samples was used as a positive control. In a parallel experiment, the stability of detection of SARS-CoV2 sgRNA by RT-qPCR in samples transported in PBS and VTM also was examined after remaining at room temperature for time points ranging from 0 to 18 hours. These experiments mimicked field conditions, in which specimens remain in transport at RT for periods up to 18 hours. Twenty samples from each of two subjects were kept for 0, 2, 4, 6 h or overnight at RT in VTM or PBS to mimic these real-world transport condition. Ct values were again compared for the RT-qPCRs for the three viral genes described above across the indicated time points. To examine inter-subject variance, we examined samples from an additional 12 patients whose ET secretions were transported in either PBS or VTM; RT-qPCR was performed immediately on arrival in the lab for these 24 samples, and Ct values were again compared between those transported in VTM or PBS. Statistical analysis. Pearson correlation was used to quantify association between repeated samples within subject, between transport media, and between the three genes. Linear mixed effects models were used to address several of our research questions. These models were fitted separately for each of the 3 genes. The outcomes were the Ct values, while the predictors included the transport media (VTM versus PBS) and hours in storage (0, 2h, 4h, 6h, or 18h). The models included a random intercept for each subject, to account for repeated observations (within-subject correlation).

As Next, we used a linear mixed effects model (see Methods) to compare the sensitivity of the two transport media in the timed samples, from 0 h to overnight (18h) storage. For all three genes, there were no significant differences, and in each case, the VTM values trended higher than for PBS. We next evaluated if across individual samples, the values obtained in testing one gene correlated with the results for the other genes. Additionally, we tested whether the choice of transport medium made a difference. In total, for the 13 samples transported in VTM, the pair-wise correlations between the three genes ranged from 0.947 to 0.956. For the 14 samples transported in PBS, the correlations ranged from 0.963 to 0.991. Thus, the results for the three genes were highly correlated independent of transport medium type.",

Our experiments using clinical samples demonstrate the efficacy of PBS as a transport medium and its applicability to clinically relevant conditions, such as overnight storage at room temperature. First, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 qPCR detection with PBS as a transport medium has high intra-patient reliability. Next, using PBS for transport, we demonstrated strong inter-patient reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR. We also found strong correlation of Ct values from specimens transported in either PBS or VTM across multiple subjects with unknown viral loads. These results establish PBS as a dependable transport medium for use with clinical samples.

            "text": "Viral RNA extraction. After removal of the collection swab, 300 \u00b5l of VTM or PBS sample was transferred to a 96-well Deep Well Processing plate (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA.), and extractions were performed on a Chemagic 360 instrument using the Chemagic Viral DNA/RNA 300 Kit H96 (PerkinElmer), as described by the manufacturer. This system eliminates manual sample handling, reduces risk of cross-contamination and ensures rapid and consistent processing. In brief, extraction included 4\u00b5l of Poly(A) RNA, 10 \u00b5l of Proteinase K, 300 \u00b5l of Lysis Buffer and 8 \u00b5l of MS2 phage Internal Control added to each sample. Then 300 \u00b5l of TaqPath\u2122COVID-19C Positive Control and 300\u00b5l of nCoV Negative Control (Themo Fisher, Waltham, MA.) were added to designated wells to be extracted alongside the subject samples. Magnetic beads (150\u00b5l) were added, followed by 900 \u00b5L RNA binding buffer. The beads/RNA mixture was washed with 500 \u00b5L wash buffer 3, then with 500 \u00b5L wash buffer 4. Elution buffer was added, and residual beads washed in 500 \u00b5L water, followed by a second elution step to a final volume of 50 \u00b5l. SARS-CoV-2 assays. Assays were conducted under FDA approved EUA#200090 at RUCDR Infinite Biologics\u00ae (Piscataway, NJ). 5 \u00b5L of each extracted RNA sample was aliquoted into a 384-well plate with 5 \u00b5L of positive and no template controls aliquoted into designated wells. Amplification was performed on the ABI QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer's directions. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (FAM-labeled), S (VIC-labeled), and N (ABY-labeled) genes with a MS2 Phage Control (JUN-labeled). Data were interpreted and Ct values generated using ABI QuantStudio5 PCR Real Time PCR software v1.3 (Thermo Fisher). Reactions were in 20 \u00b5L volumes and run using the cycling protocol: 25\u00b0C for 2 min, 53\u00b0C for 10 min; 95\u00b0C for 2 min; then 95\u00b0C for 3 sec; 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, collecting the fluorescence signal during the final 60\u00b0C step, and repeated for a total of 40 cycles. Assays were performed in triplicate, and there are positive and negative assay controls with the MS2 phage as a positive control of nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR. The lower limit of SARS-CoV-2 detection is 200 copies/mL and the assay exhibits no cross-reactivity with 43 organisms and viruses that were tested.Interpretation. The TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit provided negative, positive, and internal controls to monitor the reliability of the results for the entire batch of specimens from sample extraction to PCR amplification, according to the manufacturer's instructions. MS2 Ct <37 was considered as positive, and N, ORF 1ab, and S Ct > 37 were considered negative.",

For each transport medium, there was strong correlation of values between the 9 or 10 replicates in each gene assay. These analyses indicate the consistency of the transport and measurements for samples that were obtained and stored in identical manners. Comparison of VTM and PBS. First, we constructed scatterplots of the values from all 16 subjects tested, including all 5 times studied, for a comparison of 26 values for both PBS and VTM for each of the three genes studied (Figure 2). The correlations ranged from 0.83 for the ORF1ab gene to 0.93 for the N, and all were significant (p<0.05). Since some individuals contributed samples at multiple time points, there were repeated measures per person. To examine a single measurement per person, we restricted the analysis to the data obtained at time 0 only. The correlation for the three genes did not change substantially and remained significant. Across the time 0 samples from the 16 individual subjects, the standard deviations (SD) varied with respect to the gene studied, but did not vary significantly according to the transport medium. Thus, using PBS did not significantly skew the distribution of values in relation to the VTM (data not shown).",
