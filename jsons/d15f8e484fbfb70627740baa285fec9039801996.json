While, formally, the BE ranges from the smallest hut to the largest city, this chapter focuses upon the health effects of urban areas, which increasingly are the preferred human habitat. Urban areas have many attractive and beneficial influences to human well-being. But at the same time, many effects of urban areas are harmful to well-being, and many are not even recognized as such. Most publications about these topics have described the effects of the BE separately, on either ecosystems or on human health. The interconnectivity between these two effects relative to BE is rarely studied. This paper focuses on the mutual influence and interactions between three related aspects of the BE which can impact ecosystems and human health: transportation, land use, and life style. It also explores some of the links between the BE, human health, and human security.",

Air pollution has many adverse health effects, including asthma and cardiovascular disease. Transport systems based largely on the use of private cars are a major contributor to global warming and to ecosystem degradation. This occurs directly, as the operation of vehicles releases greenhouse gases causing global climate change which is associated with altered temperature and rainfall patterns and rising sea levels. Warmer ocean temperatures are projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These effects can also harm cold water fisheries, and otherwise degrade aquatic habitats. The heat-retaining nature of road surfaces and many buildings, together with the loss of vegetation, contributes to \"heat islands\" sometimes exacerbated by particulate-dense air pollution. Heat islands may create a double burden of pollution as people respond reactively, for example with air conditioning, rather than within urban redesign, such as exchanging black for green surfaces, fewer roads and more rooftop gardens. Transportation is therefore having an impact on ecohealth as well as human health, and these are interconnected. 111 B. Morel and I.

Sensitive and critical habitats are often fragmented or sacrificed for roads, suburbs and industrial estates. Urban conurbations also pollute reservoirs, ground water, and stream networks with chemicals and pathogens, with numerous adverse health effects. Habitat loss and fragmentation are two of the most direct impacts of development on previously undeveloped land. Habitat fragmentation and an increased proximity of forest, agricultural land and human populations can promote interaction among vectors, pathogens, and hosts, and in some cases lead to increased infectious disease, including Lyme disease. Deforestation continues to increase in many developing countries, in part to supply affluent urban populations. These illustrations demonstrate that not unlike the transportation factor the BE also affects landuse, incurring major impacts on ecosystems and human health.",

Though the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health does not explicitly include security, the WHO conceptualizion of health is much broader than the absence of physical and mental disease (WHO 1948). It follows that if human health is adversely affected by the BE, then human security will also be reduced, though it is acknowledged that many other factors also influence security. Some of the factors which influence non-health aspects of security, such as the level of crime or interpersonal violence, are also likely to be influenced by the BE, including through the quality and level of social capital and psychological health. As well, the health or wellness of a person is likely to influence that person's resilience in the face of threat. In general, healthy people will feel more secure. Finally, the community level of health can influence security, by influencing one's perception of personal disease risk, including in some cases, vector borne diseases.",

These causal paradigms have included evil spirits, misdeeds, and the spells of malevolent enemies (Ahmad, 1998; Rahman, 1998) . More recently, epidemics were often attributed to \"miasmas\" -large bodies of toxic air, often found near swamps and flooded areas. In the late 19 th century, the miasmatic paradigm fell from favor, replaced by reductionist explanations stimulated by the growing power of epidemiology and microbiology. An impressive sequence of discoveries distinguished and explained, for the first time, epidemic diseases from cholera (Davey-Smith, 2002) to malaria (Nye and Gibson, 1997) , yellow fever, tuberculosis (Ryan, 1993) , polio, lung cancer and Minimata disease (Watts, 2001) due to infectious and toxic agents such as tobacco smoke and mercury. Most importantly, these causal models enabled effective methods of control, such as reducing mosquitoes, microbes and smoking. (Susser and Susser, 1986) .",

It is becoming increasingly clear that numerous issues that were previously thought of as independent of the environment are intimately connected to it. Human health, the economy, social justice, ecological processes and national security all have important environmental aspects whose magnitude and interconnections are not generally reflected in public policy. A system of public policy with two defining characteristics has evolved. First, human and ecological health protection generally have been treated as separate domains of policy, with significant differences in both the analytic methods used to characterize risks and the policies developed for risk reduction. Second, individual human health risks (e.g., of malaria, schistosomiasis or cholera) have been analyzed in isolation. The objective of risk assessment is to support decision making by assessing risks of adverse effects on 1. Introduction human health and the environment from chemicals, physical factors, and other environmental stresses. With increased recognition of the need to more effectively protect both humans and the environment, it is time to consider a move to a more integrated, \"holistic\" approach to risk assessment. The positioning of humans as a part of a broader ecology can be traced to ancient peoples, including the Greeks and Native Americans, but the modern relationship between ecosystems, humans, \"wellness\" and disease owes much to Ren\u00e9 Dubos, a microbiologist who discovered gramicidin, the world's first antibiotic, when Dubos was working in New York in 1939. Unfortunately, gramicidin proved toxic to humans. In his later life, Dubos became well-known for his work to protect the global environment, including at the world's first great summit about this, held in Stockholm in 1972 (Ward and Dubos, 1972) . Box 1. The concept of ecosystem \"services\" (Daily, 1997; Millennium Assessment, 2003) has been developed to complement the more fundamental argument that ecosystems should be preserved because of their own \"existence value\" (Fox, 1990) . Supporters argue that the concept that ecosystems provide \"services\" to humans adds a utilitarian reason for their protection. They suggest that many of the links between natural and human systems were once widely understood, by different forms of \"folk ecology\" (Ramakrishnan et al, 1998; Atran et al, 1999; Berkes, 2003) . But urbanization has created a human world with contact between people and nature that is less common and less intimate than the past, disrupting the understanding of these connections, and partially insulating many humans from adverse ecosystem change.",

For example, the excessive clearing of a forest can contribute to both flooding during heavy rain and aridity during periods of dryness, while an intact forest will reduce both of these extremes by acting as a sponge that both absorbs and releases water. Other regulating services include erosion control, climate modification, and water and air purification. As well, ecosystems provide important spiritual, recreational, and cultural \"services.\" Many people find psychological and spiritual refreshment through contact with special and even sacred aspects of nature, such as visual landscapes, wilderness, the seashore and special groves and springs. Finally, ecosystems provide \"supporting\" services that make all of the others possible. These include soil formation, nutrient recycling and pollination. For example, pollinators from intact forest patches have been shown to substantially increase the yield of coffee in adjacent plantations (Ricketts et al, 2004 ). There is a growing concern that the quality and quantity of key ecosystem services are declining in many regions and in the world as a whole, especially in relation to the still growing global population (Crutzen, 2002; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003) . There are particular concerns over the long-term capacity of global food production, including deep sea and coastal fisheries, and for the productivity of dryland ecosystems. More broadly, there are concerns over adverse social changes in response to, and perhaps exacerbating, ecosystem service depletion.

This paradigm, sometimes called \"ecohealth,\" is still little known (Rapport, 1997) . As mentioned, it is related to other health paradigms and complements rather than substitutes these causal models. Supporters of ecohealth argue that this new field has much to offer at diagnostic, therapeutic and preventitive levels. For example, if good health -even partly -depends on regular exposure and contact with non-human species, then insights from ecohealth may lead to changes to urban design that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but beneficial to health and well-being.",

However, the dramatic increase in the frequency of asthma has also led investigators to consider other possible causal factors, including diet, lifestyle, air pollution and broad environmental factors (von Mutius, 2003). The role of some air pollutants in worsening symptoms in people with asthma is beyond any doubt. Increases in ambient levels of ozone (O 3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and particulate matter sulfates, have been correlated with emergency department visits and hospital admissions for asthma. In a recent study, a team of scientists recruited a group of 3,535 school-age children in Southern California who did not have asthma, and followed them for five years (McConnell et al. 2002) . The results of this and another study conducted in adults (McDonnell et al. 1999) found that chronic exposure to ozone not only worsens symptoms among people with asthma, but can also lead to the onset of the disease, among both children and adults. Evidence from the past 10 years also shows that sudden increases in ambient air pollution can cause as much cardiovascular as respiratory morbidity and mortality (Pope et al. 2004 ).",

This effect occurs because surfaces like dark roads and roof tops absorb heat from the sun and radiate heat back into the atmosphere. In addition urban areas are usually poor in vegetation that would provide shade and cool air. Excessive heat, especially in populations that are not inured to it (Frumkin 2002 (Frumkin , 2004 Kalkstein 2002) is responsible for various health effects including fainting, hyperventilation and edema. Heat exhaustion is a more severe condition and presages fatal heat stroke. Heat may further contribute to the adverse effects of air pollution. Increased temperatures raise energy consumption, especially from air conditioners, thus triggering more emission of pollutants from fossil fuel burning power plants (U.S. EPA 2001).",

Paved roads and parking lots, both of which are necessary to support vehicular use, create the majority of impervious areas in the landscape. Impervious surfaces impede the recharge of groundwater from rainwater, funnel toxic chemicals into waterways, and can increase erosion, flooding and changed water temperatures (Jackson 2002) .

More land was developed during the five-year period from 1992-1997 than during the 10-year period that preceded it (U.S. EPA 2001). In addition to directly destroying areas of natural habitat, development usually fragments habitat and increases the invasion of introduced species, altering ecosystem function and changing biodiversity. However, development can sometimes take account of ecology, leading to the preservation of critical habitats such as wetlands, and creating greenways and buffer zones around sensitive habitat, thus preserving ecosystem integrity and create amenities for adjacent neighborhoods. Habitat loss and fragmentation are two of the most direct impacts of development on previously undeveloped land. Habitat fragmentation and an increased proximity of forest, agricultural land and human populations can promote interaction among vectors, pathogens, and hosts (Koren and Crawford-Brown, 2004) , and in some cases lead to increased infectious disease, including Lyme disease in the northeastern part of the U.S. (LoGiudice et al. 2003) . In other parts of the world changes in agricultural practices, made more intensive to feed large and growing urban populations, have contributed to the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia, cryptosporidiosis in Western countries, and a range of food-borne diseases in many parts of the world ( Epstein et al. 2003 , Patz et al. 2004 .

            "text": "In the U.S., approximately 75% of people live in coastal watersheds, with coastal urbanization and agricultural and industrial development increasing at rapid rates. As mentioned, urban development affects water quality through alterations to the natural flow of water within a watershed, particularly by increasing impervious surfaces and channeling stormwater runoff. The EPA estimates that 36 percent of the nation's lakes, rivers, and estuaries are impaired by pollution. Stormwater is often polluted by pathogens, pesticides, fertilizers from yards and farms, and a variety of other substances that have accumulated on impervious surfaces . According to research published in 2001 by Johns Hopkins University, more than 50 percent of waterborne disease outbreaks in the U.S. between 1948 and 1994 were preceded by extreme rainfall events (Curriero et al. 2001 ). Accelerating nutrient-and pathogen-enriched wastewater discharge accompanying coastal development is putting unprecedented pressure on estuaries that receive and process the bulk of land-based runoff. This has led to increased primary productivity or eutrophication, the symptoms of which pose a significant threat to coastal resources, ecological, and human health (Paerl 2002) . Eutrophic conditions are evidenced by surface algal scums, reduced water clarity, odors, and dense algal growth on shallow water substrates. Algal blooms block the light needed by submerged aquatic vegetation, and also reduce oxygen availability. As a result, the habitat for juvenile fish and shellfish is reduced. Septic systems in low density suburban and rural residential development also reduce groundwater quality. Toxin producing dinoflagellates are found throughout the marine world and can cause a range of health effects from acute neurologic diseases (such as ciguatera and paralytic shellfish poisoning) to chronic dementia (such as amnesic shellfish poisoning from domoic acid). Disease is associated predominantly with the ingestion of contaminated fish and shellfish. However, disease can also occur through epidermal contact and inhalation (Baden et al., 1995) . In the latter route, dinoflagellates are lysed by the surf and release toxins that may cause conjunctival irritation, rhinorrhea and nonproductive cough in persons who are close to the water (Morris et al., 1991) . Cyanobacterial toxins have been associated with contact irritation after bathing in marine waters (Codd et al., 1989) . This is yet another example of how the environment and human health are tightly linked. This linking is an important factor that needs to be considered in the context of public policies and risk assessment.",

The death rate amongst overweight people is as much as 2.5 times higher than that of non-obese people. Obesity co-morbidities are a major problem as well, with an estimated $75 billion spent annually to treat these maladies. A major risk factor for obese people is Type II diabetes, and the current epidemic of Type II diabetes tracks closely with the increase in being overweight (Mokdad et al. 2004) . It is most disturbing that the prevalence of overweight children and adolescents is increasing, probably at a greater rate than among adults. The increased prevalence of obese children is already reducing the average age of onset of Type II diabetes, and this is likely to cause an immense economic and health burden in the years to come, as the complications of Type II diabetes, including heart, kidney and eye disease, also become manifest at a younger age.

Commuting stress may affect well-being and social relationships both on the roads and off the roads. As described above, there is also growing evidence that appreciation of the aesthetics of and connectivity to nature seem to positively influence human health (Frumkin 2001) . In a recent article, Jackson (2003) has written: \"Parks and gardens have long been noted for their restorative effects on both mental and physical health. E.O. Wilson has coined the term biophilia to express the apparently innate human attraction to nature, citing a widely-shared evolutionary explanation that relates pleasing, park-like settings to prehistoric cues for water and shelter.\"",

For practical reasons, the methodologies for human health and ecological risk assessment developed independently. The potential applicability of understanding the complex interconnection between the environment and health and incorporating it into integrated human and ecological risk assessments makes this issue important and timely.",

In this paper we have emphasized the effects of the BE on the environment considering the effects both on ecosystems and on human health and pointing out the interconnectivity between them. It is not further reasonable to separate ecohealth from human health. It is evident from the work reviewed in this paper that changes in the environment such as those due to the BE inevitably have consequences for ecosystems and human health.",

Development patterns and practices also indirectly affect environmental quality since the BE influences the travel decisions that people make. Many development patterns encourage increased use of motor vehicles, which is associated with decreased physical activity, leading to obesity and consequent increases in Type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and increased cancer, as well as increased air pollution, including greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change. Air pollution and climate change, in turn, can adversely affect respiratory illnesses, heat island effect, water quality and habitat.",
