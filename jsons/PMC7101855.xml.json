T. reesei produces three types of cellulases: cellobiohydrolases (CBH1 and CBH2), endoglucanases (mainly include EGL1 and EGL2), and \u03b2-glucosidase (mainly BGL1). Cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases synergistically hydrolyze cellulose to produce cello-oligosaccharides (mainly cellobiose). \u03b2-Glucosidases degrade cellobiose into the end product glucose. T. reesei also expresses large amounts of xylanase, among which XYN1 and XYN2 are the most abundant (Zeilinger et al. 1996). Strain RUT C30 serves as a cellulase hyperproducer and is employed in research and in the industry (Martinez et al. 2008; Bischof et al. 2016). Therefore, enhancing cellulase production in T. reesei RUT C30 is useful for an economical biorefinery.",

Among them, XYR1 and ACE3 are key transcriptional activators, and deletion of xyr1 or ace3 abrogates cellulase production (Stricker et al. 2006; Akel et al. 2009; H\u00e4kkinen et al. 2014; Castro Santos et al. 2016). ACE2 also serves as a transcriptional activator of cellulase production, and deletion of ace2 decreases mRNA levels of cellulase-encoding genes, such as cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2 (Aro et al. 2001). ACE1 is recognized as a transcriptional repressor of cellulase production, and deletion of ace1 increased the production of all main cellulase and xylanase in sophorose- and cellulose-induced cultures (Saloheimo et al. 2000; Aro et al. 2003; Portnoy et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Artificial TFs are a potentially powerful molecular strategy for modulating target gene expression and for obtaining an enhanced phenotype (Ju et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2013). Specific artificial transcriptional activators have been constructed to improve cellulase production in T. reesei (Su et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2016a, 2017, 2018). An artificial transcriptional activator constructed by fusing the two DNA-binding domains of ACE1 and CRE1 with an effector domain of ACE2 can regulate the expression of cellulase genes (Su et al. 2009). T. reesei U3, a mutant strain with enhanced cellulase production, was identified via screening with construction of an artificial zinc finger protein library (Zhang et al. 2016a). Similarly, transformant zxy-2 of an artificial transcriptional activator\u2014containing the binding domain of CRE1 linked to the effector and binding domains of XYR1\u2014yields constitutive cellulase production from glucose as the sole carbon source (Zhang et al. 2017). A universal and simple pattern strategy for constructing a series of artificial transcriptional activators in T. reesei must be developed further. Recently, we improved cellulase production in T. reesei by substituting natural TFs with minimal transcriptional activators (Zhang et al. 2018) designed by linking one DNA-binding domain of ACE2 or CRE1 to the C-terminal 78 amino acid residues (aa) of herpes simplex virus protein VP16, which act as an activation domain that activates transcription of early viral genes (Sadowski et al. 1988; Triezenberg et al. 1988).",

We hypothesized that cellulase production would be increased by fusing the strong transcriptional activation domain of VP16 to the C terminus of a natural TF to enhance its transcriptional activation. Three ETAs including XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were designed by fusing the VP16 domain to the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, and ACE1, respectively (Fig. 1). The expression plasmids pXYR1VP, pACE2VP, and pACE1VP for the three ETAs were constructed by ligating the erasable hygromycin selection marker LML2.1 (Fig. 1), which was eliminated by the product of a chimeric Cre recombinase gene (Zhang et al. 2016b). The expression plasmids were introduced into the genome of the T. reesei hypercellulolytic mutant RUT C30 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to replace natural TFs XYR1, ACE2, and ACE1 by homologous double exchange (Fig. 1), eliminating the risk of random insertion and unpredictable mutagenesis. The transformed strains with confirmed gene replacement were selected to eliminate the hygromycin selectable marker by xylose induction to obtain the final transformants. All the transformants were identified as correctly transformed ETA strains and harbored single-copy DNA integration (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Three randomly screened transformants TXYR1VP-1/-2/-3, TACE2VP-1/-2/-3, and TACE1VP-1/-2/-3 for each ETA were analyzed further.\n",

Regardless of the carbon sources, growth rates of transformants TACE2VP and TACE1VP were not significantly different from that of the control (Fig. 2a\u2013c). Thus, ACE2VP and ACE1VP had no effect on basic cellular metabolism. Similarly, the growth of TXYR1VP showed no significant differences from the control when cultured in glycerol (Fig. 2a). Nevertheless, the growth rates of TXYR1VP on lactose and Avicel were much lower than the growth rate of the control, with growth on Avicel being particularly slow (Fig. 2b, c), indicating that XYR1VP limits cellulase synthesis in TXYR1VP.\n",

TXYR1VP manifested nearly no filter paper activity (FPA) in the Avicel- or lactose-based medium (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the p-nitrophenol-d-cellobioside hydrolase (pNPCase), the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose hydrolase (CMCase), and the 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside hydrolase (pNPGase) activities in TXYR1VP were nearly absent as compared to the control (Fig. 3B\u2013D). Additionally, the transcript levels of cellulase-related genes cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2 were low compared to those in the control (Fig. 3E, F), suggesting that XYR1VP abrogated cellulase production. Consequently, the dramatically decreased growth rate of TXYR1VP on Avicel resulted from its cellulase-negative phenotype in the presence of inducing carbon sources (Avicel and lactose). A lack of cellulase hindered the growth of TXYR1VP in the Avicel-based medium. The cellulase-free phenotype was observed not only in XYR1VP transformants but also in ACE3VP transformants, in which the strong transcriptional activation domain of VP16 was fused to the C terminus of ACE3 (data not shown).\n",

TXYR1VP showed a xylanase upregulation phenotype in glycerol- and lactose-based media, and a similar xylanase activity (U/mL) was observed in the Avicel-based medium as compared to that in the control. Additionally, TXYR1VP showed higher xylanase activities per unit of biomass with a 51% increase in xylanase I activity and an 80% increase in xylanase II activity compared to that in RUT C30 (Additional file 1: Figure S2a, b). Elevated transcript levels of xylanase genes were detected in TXYR1VP regardless of the carbon sources; this finding is consistent with the enhanced xylanase activities (Additional file 1: Figure S2c\u2013e). TXYR1VP, a xylanase-hyperproducing strain with a cellulase-free phenotype, can be employed in some industries where xylanase is desired, while cellulase is undesirable, e.g., in paper recycling (Buchert et al. 1998).",

By contrast, overexpression of xyr1 has been found not only to markedly enhance xylanase activity but also to increase cellulase activity in transformants (Mach-Aigner et al. 2008; Uzbas et al. 2012). Therefore, we hypothesized that the C-terminal fusion of XYR1 would alter the function of XYR1VP. Using COILS (Lupas et al. 1991; Lichius et al. 2015) predicted that the C terminus of XYR1 is a coiled-coil domain and likely mediates homodimerization of XYR1. Therefore, fusing the VP16 activation domain at the C terminus of XYR1 abrogated the expression of cellulase genes in T. reesei. It is very important to study the function of the C terminus of XYR1. Nonetheless, the positive effect on xylanase gene expression observed after fusion of the VP16 activation domain indicated distinct regulatory mechanisms between cellulase and xylanase genes in terms of transcription. The different responsiveness of XYR1 to cellulase and xylanase was also observed by Pucher et al. (2011). Notably, the cellulolytic regulon of XYR1 is positively affected, whereas the xylanolytic regulon is affected negatively in a T. reesei QM9414 strain constitutively expressing xyr1 (Pucher et al. 2011). These different regulatory mechanisms for cellulase gene transcription are supported by in silico identification of XYR1-binding sites in promoter regions, which are reported to occur at dramatically different frequencies in the promoter region of cbh1 and xyn1: 14-fold for cbh1 and only 4-fold for xyn1 (Rauscher et al. 2006; Furukawa et al. 2009).",

One study revealed no effect on xyn1 expression in strains in which ace2 was deleted (Aro et al. 2001).

ACE2 can affect the expression of xyn2 and bgl1 (Aro et al. 2001; Stricker et al. 2008). Additionally, phosphorylation and dimerization are prerequisites for ACE2 to bind the promoters of target genes (Stricker et al. 2008).

The increased transcript levels of ace2vp in TACE2VP may have also promoted cellulase production. The transcript levels of xyr1, ace3, and ace1 in TACE2VP were similar to those in the control (an expression increase was approximately onefold), indicating that ACE2VP mainly affects the expression of cellulase genes and its own expression and has little effect on other TFs.",

The amount of protein secreted from TACE1VP notably increased (Additional file 1: Figure S4a). Additionally, elevated cellulase activities were observed in TACE1VP as compared to those in the control in both Avicel- and lactose-based media (Fig. 5A\u2013D). Cellulase production by TACE1VP was higher in the Avicel-based medium than in the lactose-based medium. The highest FPase activity of TACE1VP transformants was 3.2 \u00b1 0.2 U/mL in the Avicel-based medium, with an increase in activity of approximately 80% on day 4 compared to that in the control; this result is consistent with the enhanced pNPCase, CMCase, and pNPGase activities (Fig. 5B\u2013D). Xylanase activities (on day 4) of TACE1VP transformants rose by nearly 50% in the Avicel-based medium as compared to the control (Additional file 1: Figure S4b, c). These results suggested that ACE1VP promotes cellulase and xylanase production in both Avicel- and lactose-based media. It has been reported that ace1 is a repressor and deleting ace1 increases the amounts of cellulase produced in T. reesei (Aro et al. 2003). Here, ACE1VP is an artificial TF that promotes cellulase production. ACE1VP did not elevate the transcript level of itself but promoted the transcript levels of the cellulase genes and of transcriptional activators xyr1 and ace3. Therefore, ACE1VP harbors positive transcriptional effects for cellulase production, whereas native ACE1 had a negative effect on cellulase production.\n",

Similarly, there was a remarkable increase (~ 1.3 to 3.0-fold) in the transcript levels of cellulase genes in TACE1VP as compared to the control strain in the lactose-based medium (Fig. 5F). The elevated transcript levels were consistent with increased enzyme production by TACE1VP in both Avicel- and lactose-based media. Aro et al.

At the same FPase loading (15 U/g pretreated corn stover), 33.8 \u00b1 1.5 g/L glucose was produced after 72 h of incubation by crude cellulase from TACE1VP. This result was approximately 22.6% higher than that produced by RUT C30 (Fig. 6). The increased glucose release resulted from enhanced pNPGase activity in TACE1VP, which can hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose. There was no significant difference in the amount of glucose released between the crude enzymes from TACE2VP and the control (Additional file 1: Figure S5); these data are in agreement with the unimproved level of pNPGase activity from TACE2VP in comparison with the control. Nonetheless, the production of cellulase by TACE2VP was improved, resulting in a smaller crude cellulase volume loading as compared to the control. Thus, the costs of cellulase from TACE1VP to TACE2VP were reduced successfully.\n",

Additionally, cellulase from strain RUT C30 supplemented with \u03b2-glucosidase showed similar hydrolysis performance relative to the commercial CTec2. This phenomenon has been described in other reports too (Zhang et al. 2017, 2018), suggesting that the cellulase secreted by strain RUT C30 contains insufficient amounts of \u03b2-glucosidase (Pryor and Nahar 2015; Li et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016a).
