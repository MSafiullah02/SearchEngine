To curb the spread of the virus, Chinese health authorities have taken the strictest massive anti-epidemic actions since Jan 2020, including mass isolation, social distancing and community containment [2, 3]. Moreover, the government has implemented traffic restrictions across the whole country with massive reduction in public transportation capacity. As the epidemic situation remains fraught in China, key epidemiological questions, such as the effectiveness of implemented strategies for disease control, remain to be fully investigated.",

On February 5, three cabin hospitals and two other makeshift hospitals successively started to treat infected patients. By March 9, 346 medical teams and 42,600 medical professionals have been dispatched from other provinces across the country to combat the epidemic in Hubei province. It is reported that 7512 designated hospitals and related fever clinic are mobilized nationwide [4]. However, the nationwide mobilization of medical resources could severely disturb local routine medical service. According to the 2018 National Report on the Services, Quality and Safety in Medical Care System [5], currently about 2 million patients each year travel across regions to seek medical care in China, among which 43% of all the cross-regional cases are concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (842 thousand cases in total). These three metropolises play a pivotal role in the healthcare system in China, providing high-quality medical service for patients in China. Notably, over thousands of medical professionals from medical centers in these metropolises have been dispatched to Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province to fight COVID-19 [6]. As the full resumption of normal healthcare services in the metropolises marks the complete restoration of healthcare system in China from the epidemic of COVID-19, providing estimation on the number of affected patients and prediction of restoration of routine medical service is urgently needed to facilitate preparedness of the healthcare system.",

In addition, a new House quarantine module (H) was added to demonstrate the effectiveness of new initiatives, as shown in Fig. 1 (See details in the Supplemental Materials Part 1). In order to estimate the epidemic situation of large medical centers and predict the time to restore the functions of daily medical service, we utilized data from Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou to simulate the development of the epidemic assuming that only human-to-human transmission exists, no special medicine is found at this stage and no major health events happen [10\u201312]. In the meantime, special consideration was given to the epidemic situation in Wuhan, as it\u2019s the epicenter of epidemic. We constructed a specific model to estimate the impact of community containment and construction of makeshift hospitals on the epidemic situation in Wuhan. The date when the first confirmed case was detected in local government was used as the first day for modeling the local epidemic situation, specifically, Dec 8, 2019 in Wuhan [1], Jan 13, Jan 12 and Jan 21, 2020 respectively in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou [13\u201315].Furthermore, we adopted a strategy different from that of the previous cumulant-based modeling methods [9]. We counted the daily number of people excluding dead and recovered cases to ensure the independence of the current status of each patient, so as to guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of the SEIR model.\n",

The modified SEIR model simulated the consequences of several measures, including quarantine, the increment of medical professionals and beds. Wuhan was locked down 46 days after the outbreak of the epidemic, and in the meantime other cities strictly restricted the movement of population and initiated home-based quarantine. As a result, the daily growth of exposed people was significantly controlled and gradually dropped down to 15,000 people, which fundamentally minimize the epidemic risk of COVID-19.\n",

The recovery rate in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou rose steadily to more than 45%, with a death rate lower than 1%. According to the estimation, there will be 480 confirmed cases in Beijing, 360 in Shanghai, and 380 in Guangzhou. Nevertheless, the death rates in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are significantly lower than that of Wuhan (1% vs. 4%), while the recovery rates are comparatively higher (45% vs. 16%), suggesting the dispatch of medical professionals have limited negative impact on the local epidemic control. This finding suggests that the growth of epidemic has been slowing down and is gradually reaching the peak. Based on the deduction results of MLP model, the epidemic of Wuhan may reach its inflection point at the end of this March and come to an end in April. The outbreak in Shanghai (Fig. 5), Beijing (Fig. 6) and Guangzhou (Fig. 7) will end about 1 month earlier than expected. Given that all medical professionals engaged in the epidemic treatment should be quarantine for 2 weeks, the national healthcare system (except Wuhan) would return to normal in mid-April.\n",

In this study, we constructed a mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situation in Wuhan and other parts in China (represented by Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou). Compared to Wu\u2019s study [20], we conducted multi-model analysis and prediction, with special consideration given to the massive anti-epidemic actions taken by Chinese authorities, such as community containment, large-scale mobilization of medical professionals and rapid expansion of beds capacity. In line with Chen\u2019s study, which points to the effectiveness of massive interventions taken by China on the control of COVID-19 epidemic [21], we estimated that the end of COVID-19 would occur about 1 month earlier, ending in late April in Hubei and late March in the rest region of China (except Hubei). The recovery of national medical service was estimated to be observed in mid-April. However, the rapid expansion of migrant patients early after the end of the epidemic would bring significant pressure to medical service in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.",

We introduced the House quarantine module (H), the rehabilitation coefficient (\u03b2), the quarantine measures variable and the cabin hospital variable. Moreover, the real-time network data was leveraged in this modified SEIR model. The traditional SEIR model is flawed by inaccuracy to predict the inflection point of the epidemic [23]. We used neural network to address this issue. Compared to the traditional time series prediction algorithms, the neural networks process the distributed parallel information by coordinating the interconnection among massive internal nodes [24]. Hence, it is superior in large-scale parallel processing, distributed storage, elastic topology, high redundancy and high robustness, making it more suitable for high-speed non-linear operations. As such, we combined the neural networks with SEIR model, constructing model based on official data to compare the prediction accuracy among four commonly used neural networks and adopted the optimal model for the prediction for the epidemiological trend of COVID-19.",

As public transportation is being shut down, a large number of patients are having difficulty to access large medical centers, leading to a waste of medical resources among these medical centers. To visualize the impact of this issue, we utilized the Baidu Migration Platform to obtain definitive data of population migration index among Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Based on the ARIMA model, we estimated that the number of cross-regional patients in major medical centers among those three large cities would be reduced by approximately 59 thousand during the first quarter of 2020. The predictions based on this model might be reliable because of its advantage in forecasting time series when compared to the general mathematical models like regression analysis and linear function. According to our analysis, an extra 59 thousand migrant patients would head to the major medical centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, posing a great challenge to the metropolitan healthcare system. Thus, Chinese health authorities should make adequate preparation for triaging patients and their accompanied families. In addition, sufficient attention must be paid to the infected patients with excessively long incubation period and asymptomatic 2019-nCoV carriers [26]. Since 70% of patients are cross-regional cases in tertiary hospitals in Beijing, massive number of migrant patients would raise challenges to local epidemic control during the early stage after the containment of COVID-19. The relevant authorities should develop strategies for health inspection and quarantine. Our results also underscore the importance of a hierarchical healthcare system, which relies on regional medical centers to triage patients.",
