Human monoclonal antibodies have very good probability of being 32 safe and effective tools for therapy and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Here we 33 describe the screening of PBMCs from seven people who survived Covid-19 infection to isolate 34 human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Over 1,100 memory B cells were single-cell 35 sorted using the stabilized prefusion form of the spike protein and incubated for two weeks to allow 36 natural production of antibodies. Supernatants from each cell were tested by ELISA for spike 37 protein binding, and positive antibodies were further tested for neutralization of spike binding to 38 receptor(s) on Vero E6 cells and for virus neutralization in vitro. From the 1,167 memory B specific 39 for SARS-CoV-2, we recovered 318 B lymphocytes expressing human monoclonals recognizing the 40 spike protein and 74 of these were able to inhibit the binding of the spike protein to the receptor. 41 Finally, 17 mAbs were able to neutralize the virus when assessed for neutralization in vitro. Lead 42 candidates to progress into the drug development pipeline will be selected from the panel of 43 neutralizing antibodies identified with the procedure described in this study.",

This first 48 wave of infection is likely to be followed by additional waves in the next few years, until herd 49 immunity, acquired by vaccination or by infection, will constrain the circulation of the virus. It is 50 therefore imperative to develop therapeutic and preventive tools to face the next waves of SARS-51 CoV-2 infections as soon as possible. Among the many therapeutic options available, human 52 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the ones that can be developed in the shortest period of time. In 53 fact, the extensive clinical experience with the safety of more than 50 commercial mAbs approved 54 to treat cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders provides high confidence on their safety. 55 These advantages, combined with the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, support and justify 56 an accelerated regulatory pathway. In addition, the long industrial experience in developing and 57 manufacturing mAbs decreases the risks usually associated with the technical development of 58 investigational products. Finally, the incredible technical progress in the field allows to shorten the 59 conventional timelines and go from discovery to proof of concept trials in 5-6 months (1). Indeed, 60 in the case of Ebola, mAbs were the first therapeutic intervention recommended by the World 61 Health Organization (WHO) and they were developed faster than vaccines or other drugs (2).",

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 entry into host 65 cells is mediated by the interaction between S-protein and the human angiotensin converting 66 enzyme 2 (ACE2) (3, 5) . The S-protein is a trimeric class I viral fusion protein which exists in a 67 metastable prefusion conformation and in a stable postfusion state. Each S-protein monomer is 68 composed of two distinct regions, the S1 and S2 subunits. Structural rearrangement occurs when the 69 receptor binding domain (RBD) present in the S1 subunit binds to the host cell membrane. This 70 4 interaction destabilizes the prefusion state of the S-protein triggering the transition into the 71 postfusion conformation which in turn results in the ingress of the virus particle into the host cell 72 (6). Single-cell RNA-seq analyses to evaluate the expression levels of ACE2 in different human 73 organs have shown that SARS-CoV-2, through the S-protein, can invade human cells in different 74 major physiological systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary 75 systems, thus enhancing the possibility of spreading and infection (7).",

As the S-protein RBD domain is mainly 78 exposed when this glycoprotein is in its prefusion state (6), we screened naturally produced mAbs 79 against either the S1/S2 subunits and the S-protein trimer stabilized in its prefusion conformation 80 (6). This strategy allows us to identify mAbs able to recognize linear epitopes as well as highly 81 neutralizing trimer specific regions on the S-protein surface. The potent neutralizing effect of trimer 82 specific mAbs has already been shown for other pathogens including the respiratory syncytial virus 83 (RSV) (8, 9) . 84 In this paper we report the identification of a panel of 318 mAbs from which we plan to select lead 85 candidates for clinical development. 89 Patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in two ongoing clinical studies based 90 in Rome, Italy (National Institute for Infectious Diseases, IRCCS, Lazzaro Spallanzani) and Siena, 91 Italy (Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese). We firstly examined whether these patients had 92 anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-protein antibodies. Plasma samples were evaluated by enzyme linked 93 immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess the polyclonal response to the S-protein trimer, for their 94 ability to neutralize the binding of the spike protein to Vero E6 cells (neutralization of binding or 95 NOB assay) and for their potency in neutralizing the cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 96 infection in vitro. Results shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 show that, among the seven donors 97 included in this study, six were able to produce high titers of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein specific 98 antibodies and in particular donors R-042, R-122 and R-188 showed the highest virus neutralizing 99 titers.
