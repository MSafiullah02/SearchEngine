As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2\n, the HCoV-229E S protein belongs to the typical type I membrane protein. The two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) were predicted using the computer program of LearnCoil-VMF [39]. The predicted HR1 region covers amino acids 777\u2013916, and the relevant HR2 includes the amino acids 1057\u20131105 (in the bottom panel of Fig. 2). To achieve the soluble production of the HCoV-229E fusion core, both HR1 and HR2 regions were rationally modified (Fig. 3\nA), basing multiple lines of considerations including alignments of HCoV-229E with the other related coronaviruses in their corresponding conserved regions (Fig. 3B) [12], [29], [36]. Subsequently, the HCoV-229E fusion core (2-Helix construct) was designed successfully by connecting the truncated HR1 (789\u2013852) and extended HR2 (1053\u20131110) with a flexible linker (SGGRGG, single amino acid abbreviation) (Fig. 3C). Finally, the DNA coding sequence with optimized codes in Escherichia coli was amplified via the overlapping PCR technique, and then was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Pharmacia) between the restriction sites of BamHI and XhoI (introduced by PCR primers). The resultant recombinant plasmid was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.",

The fusion core consisted of HR1, a truncated type of the LearnCoil-VMF predicted HR1, connected with HR2, an extended version of the LearnCoil-VMF predicted HR2, by a flexible linker (SGGRGG).

Luckily, the GST-fused virus fusion core protein in the soluble form was observed in the supernatant of the bacteria lysate, and the GST-removed virus fusion core protein run on the 17% SDS\u2013PAGE showed at the position of the expected size (Fig. 5\n).

Therefore, many virologists in the world have been prompted to develop the relevant investigations, such as the infection pathway, the pathogenic mechanism, the interaction between HCoV-229E and its host cell, etc. So far, nearly none of very nice ways can be available to effectively prevent or cure the HCoV-229E-related diseases.

As we know that HR1 or its derivatives of NDV [23], [32], HR2 or its derivative coming from HR2 (HIV, SARS-CoV, MHV, etc.) [18], [19], [24], [25], [26], [29], and even both HR1 and HR2 of HRSV [8], [9], [10] can inhibit the membrane fusion during the virus entry, perturbing the successful infection of virus. Most excitingly, two small molecule drugs against HRSV fusion have been well-documented [33]. Thereby, it will be of interest to test whether HR1 or HR2 (including its equivalent derivative) has the inhibitory activity and to screen some small molecule drugs targeting for inhibition of membrane fusion mediated by HCoV-229E fusion protein in the near future. To our knowledge, it for the first time, provided the biochemical and biophysical basis of the HCoV-229E fusion core, indicating the essence of type I membrane fusion mechanism utilized by HCoV-229E, and also suggesting another novel direction to design the polypeptide or small molecule drugs, which perturbed HCoV-229E membrane fusion with its host cells, for the prevention and therapeutics of HCoV-229E related illness.",
