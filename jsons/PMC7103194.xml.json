            "text": "Influenza A viruses are zoonotic pathogens, which have been rampant periodically for centuries throughout the world. Every year, respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses have resulted in about 500 million human infections and 0.25\u20130.5 million victims worldwide [1, 2]. The H3N2 virus is the primary cause of human influenza morbidity and mortality in the world [3]. Therefore, early and sensitive detection of the influenza A virus is important to control the outbreaks. To date, different methods have been developed for detecting influenza A viruses such as virus culture [4\u20136], loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [7\u20139], polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods [10\u201312], enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [13\u201315] and microarray technology [16\u201318]. However, they are labor intensive, have complex sample pretreatment, low sensitivity, high cost and require appropriate laboratory facilities and well-trained technicians. To improve the sensitivity, some researchers have developed electrochemical biosensors for the detection of the influenza virus [19, 20]. Although the strategies of electrode immobilization are well developed, some drawbacks still exist such as the complicated, tedious and time-consuming immobilization procedures, and low reproducibility and regeneration ability [21\u201323]. Therefore, a simple, rapid and reliable method is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Colorimetric assays have attracted much attention due to the simplicity, practicality, and visibility of the target, without the utilization of expensive and sophisticated instruments [24\u201327]. Researchers have developed various methods and strategies for colorimetric assays. Recently, enzyme [28] and enzyme-functionalized nanostructure-based colorimetric biosensors [29\u201331] have shown great application value in the colorimetric assays. These methods exhibited high catalytic activity and high specificity. However, since the signals of the colorimetric biosensors are based on the distinction between non-colored and colored solution, and this can only be realized with confidence when the concentrations of the target are high, making ultrasensitive detection with the naked eye unsuitable. For example, Gao et al [31] designed a magnetic bead (MB)-based assay for the analysis of biomolecules. The MBs were employed as peroxidase mimics and used to catalyze the 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (non-colored solution) to produce a colored solution. It is hard to distinguish between two similar-looking lightly colored solutions. To solve this problem, Rica and Stevens [32] had exploited a new method based on the reduction of gold ions by hydrogen peroxide, which generates blue- or red-colored solutions in the absence or presence of the target, respectively. In detail, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are grown as nonaggregated red colloidal suspensions, when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is high. Whereas, blue-colored NP solutions of aggregated AuNPs are acquired when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is low. The generation of two differently colored AuNP solutions has advantages over traditional colorimetric assays due to the distinction of two differently colored solutions being easier than the differentiation of two similar-looking lightly colored solutions.",

This was followed by the addition of ConA-GOx-AuNPs, which were formed by the modification of glucose oxidase (GOx) and concanavalin A (ConA) onto AuNPs. The ConA-GOx-AuNPs were conjugated to the H3N2 virus through the ConA-glycan interaction. The sandwich complex was incubated with glucose solution to trigger an enzymatic reaction to produce hydrogen peroxide. The determination of H3N2 concentration was realized by comparing the two differently colored AuNPs.

Hence, 40 \u03bcg of functionalized MMPs were chosen in this assay. Since the amount of glucose might have an influence on the enzymatic catalysis reaction, excessive glucose was used to ensure the completion of the reaction. In addition, the incubation time that influenced the enzymatic catalysis reaction was explored and the results are shown in figure 5.

In addition, TEM images (figures 6(C) and (D)) showed that AuNPs aggregated at low concentration of target and dispersed well at higher concentration of target. The plot of the UV-vis intensities versus the concentrations of the virus is presented in figure 6(B). It exhibited a good linear relationship with the linear equation y = 0.0237 + 0.0018 \u00d7 (R2 = 0.9942). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 11.16 \u03bcg ml\u22121 (3\u03c3/slope, whereas \u03c3 is the relative standard deviation of a blank solution, n = 11). Seven parallel measurements of 200 \u03bcg ml\u22121 target H3N2 were used for estimating the precision, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 1.17%, and the blank standard deviation was 0.670%. Furthermore, the introduction of magnetic separation made it easier to detect complex samples than with other methods [36\u201338] and this colorimetric assay would be possible for sensing low concentrations of target in a real sample [39] owing to the separation and enrichment functions of the  MBs.",
