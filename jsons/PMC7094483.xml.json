DEAD box proteins function by modifying RNA secondary structure in an ATP-dependent manner (Linder and Fuller-Pace, 2013), and play a role in RNA trafficking (Linder and Stutz, 2001, Montpetit et al., 2012). There are >30 DEAD box genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome (2014).",

For example, the vasa gene encodes a multifunctional DEAD box protein that localizes to the posterior pole in oocytes and is required for completion of oogenesis (Lasko, 2013). Vasa has also been implicated in chromatin condensation and generation of small non-coding RNAs (Pek and Kai, 2011, Zhang et al., 2012). Belle, which is closely related to Vasa, is essential for larval development and required for both male and female fertility (Johnstone et al., 2005). Mutation of pitchoune, encoding another DEAD box helicase, results in developmental arrest during the first instar stage. Pitchoune has been implicated in regulating cell growth and proliferation (Zaffran et al., 1998).",

Rafti et al. described the expression of Ddx1 in Drosophila in 1996, and reported elevated levels in early embryos, and expression throughout development (Rafti et al., 1996). More recently, publicly available large scale studies using gene expression microarrays and RNA deep sequencing analysis have revealed widespread expression of Ddx1 in all tissues and cell lines tested to date (St Pierre et al., 2014). These screens show elevated Ddx1 levels in the nervous system, testes and ovaries with the highest levels observed at early embryonic stages, as previously described (Rafti et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Human DDX1, which is 77% similar to Drosophila Ddx1, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma cell lines and tumors (Godbout et al., 1998, Godbout and Squire, 1993, Manohar et al., 1995, Squire et al., 1995). DDX1 is also a prognostic marker in breast cancer (Balko and Arteaga, 2011, Germain et al., 2011), and plays a role in testicular tumorigenesis (Tanaka et al., 2009). Large scale screens for disease associated genes have identified DDX1 as a potential gene of interest in cervical cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Johanneson et al., 2014, Smolonska et al., 2014). As well, DDX1 is significantly down-regulated in Down syndrome fetal brains (Kircher et al., 2002). Clues to DDX1\u2019s role in these diseases come from in vitro analysis. For example, DDX1 was identified in a subset of RNA transport granules involved in the subcellular localization of RNA molecules in neuronal axons (Kanai et al., 2004). DDX1\u2019s role in RNA trafficking is not limited to endogenously coded genes as HIV replication requires DDX1 for efficient export of unspliced viral genomic RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Edgcomb et al., 2012, Fang et al., 2005, Robertson-Anderson et al., 2011). This effect is mediated through an interaction between DDX1 and two virally encoded proteins, Rev and Tat, that are essential for RNA export (Lin et al., 2014). DDX1 is also required for efficient replication of coronavirus (Wu et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2010), and has been shown to transactivate hepatitis C and JC viral genes (Sunden et al., 2007a, Sunden et al., 2007b, Tingting et al., 2006).",

When cells are treated with ionizing radiation, DDX1 is recruited to a subset of DNA double-strand breaks (Li et al., 2008). Biochemical analysis has shown that DDX1 can unwind RNA/RNA and RNA/DNA duplexes in vitro in an ADP-dependent manner and can efficiently digest single-stranded RNA (Li et al., 2008). Finally, DDX1 has also been implicated as a tRNA splicing factor (Popow et al., 2011, Popow et al., 2014).",

When under metabolic stress or starvation conditions, developing egg chambers undergo autophagy in order to conserve energy (Barth et al., 2011, McCall, 2004). To determine if developing egg chambers in Ddx1 null flies are undergoing autophagy, we carried out immunofluorescence analysis of control and Ddx1 null ovarioles. Early stage egg chambers and germ-line stem cell niches appeared normal, indicating that the early stages of oogenesis are not disrupted in Ddx1 null flies (\nFig. 5A). Next, we stained dissected ovarioles with LysoTracker Red, a dye that is commonly used to identify autophagic cells (DeVorkin and Gorski, 2014). In Ddx1 null ovaries, at both 3 and 10 days post eclosion, we observed mid-stage autophagic egg chambers (Fig. 5B-C, arrows). Autophagic egg chambers were not observed in control and heterozygous ovaries. As mature egg chambers lacking dorsal appendages were observed in Ddx1 null ovaries, we imaged stage 8-9 egg chambers of control and Ddx1 null ovarioles for the localization of Gurken, a key factor in dorsal appendage development which localizes to the anterior dorsal corner of mid-stage oocytes (Neuman-Silberberg and Schupbach, 1996, Schupbach, 1987) (Fig. 5D). As expected, control egg chambers displayed normal Gurken localization. While a subset of egg chambers in Ddx1\nAX\n/Df(3L)ED230 ovaries (approximately half) showed the expected Gurken localization pattern, the remaining Ddx1\nAX\n/Df(3L)ED230 egg chambers and all egg chambers present in Ddx1\nAX/AX ovaries lacked any notable Gurken expression pattern.",

We identified 72 significantly down-regulated and 261 significantly up-regulated transcripts, using a cut-off of p<0.01 (Table S1). Of note, we found that RNA is expressed from the portion of the Ddx1\nAX allele retained in the genome of our Ddx1 null flies, although RNA levels were significantly reduced compared to that found in control flies. Further analysis of the region directly upstream of the Ddx1\nAX allele suggests that transcription is initiated approximately 150 bp upstream of the deletion site. Immediately upstream of this putative transcriptional start site is a variant TATA box sequence (CATAAAG) that may act as a cryptic transcription initiation site in the absence of the normal start site.",

A subsequent report showed that disrupted CG11523 is associated with a lethal phenotype (CG11523\nGD7321) (Mummery-Widmer et al., 2009). It is, therefore, likely that the effect attributed to Ddx1 mutation in 1994 was actually due to disruption of CG11523. Alternatively, the lethal phenotype observed by Zinsmaier et al. may be the result of a truncated Ddx1 product, as the location of the P-element used to generate the Ddx1\n9W1 allele is such that deletions would likely result in a truncation. A truncated gene product could cause a divergent phenotype from that of a null allele. We are unable to test these possibilities experimentally, as the original stock is no longer available.",

We observed significantly smaller ovaries containing few to no mature eggs in Ddx1 null flies. One possible explanation for reduced ovary size is disruption of stem cell maintenance and/or division; however, mutants in which the stem cell pool is affected typically display reduced numbers of early egg chambers (Li et al., 2009, Shen et al., 2009).

Our RNA deep-sequencing did not identify any of the well-characterized Gurken localization factors as being differentially expressed in Ddx1 control versus null flies. Thus, in Ddx1 null flies, disruption of gurken translation, rather than gurken RNA/protein localization, may underlie the absence of Gurken protein in the anterior dorsal corner. Intriguingly, it has been shown that the DNA damage response and small RNA processing are required for proper Gurken translation (Chen et al., 2007, Klattenhoff et al., 2007). Human DDX1 has previously been implicated in both the DNA damage response and small RNA processing (Han et al., 2014, Li et al., 2008).

Altered metabolism also provides a possible explanation for the small number of progeny generated by Ddx1\nAX\n/Df(3L)ED230 females, as we observed slightly higher pS6k levels and slightly larger body size in these mutants compared to the completely sterile Ddx1\nAX/AX females. Thus, Ddx1AX\n/Df(3L)ED230 flies may have slightly higher metabolic function than Ddx1\nAX/AX flies. This may be due to second-site alleles that are different between the Ddx1\nAX and Df(3L)ED230 genetic background.",

Following meiosis, spermiogenesis, the last stage of spermatogenesis, involves reshaping developing interconnected spermatids into individual mature sperm (Fabian and Brill, 2012). Spermiogenesis is characterized by gross morphological changes to the cell and mitochondria in particular. Developing spermatids in Ddx1 null males appear to undergo spermatid elongation, but fail to individualize.

As our analysis did not show changes in levels of spliced and unspliced tRNAs in Ddx1 null flies, it would appear that Drosophila Ddx1 is not essential for tRNA splicing.

Popow et al. showed that human DDX1 is necessary for efficient cycling of the RtcB-guanylate intermediate required for tRNA splicing in vitro (Popow et al., 2014). It is possible that tRNA generation efficiency is reduced in Ddx1\nAX/AX flies, but a compensatory mechanism is coming into play.

We verified that Sirup mRNA is uniquely spliced in Ddx1\nAX/AX larvae and up-regulated. We were also able to show that Ddx1 protein binds Sirup mRNA, which suggests that this splice site modification is due to a direct interaction with Ddx1, rather than being an indirect downstream consequence of the loss of Ddx1. Previous work has demonstrated that loss of Sirup results in shortened life span and neurodegeneration (Van Vranken et al., 2014). In agreement with our results, Sirup has also previously been shown to be up-regulated in response to starvation conditions (Erdi et al., 2012). We propose a role for Sirup in limiting metabolism during stress conditions. Sirup has recently been identified as the Drosophila homolog of yeast Sdh8 (Van Vranken et al., 2014). Similar to its yeast homologue, Drosophila Sirup may be required to stabilize the succinate dehydrogenase holocomplex, and enhance succinate dehydrogenase activity.",

This is in line with observations that human DDX1 is required for efficient trafficking of unspliced viral RNA genomes (Edgcomb et al., 2012, Fang et al., 2005, Robertson-Anderson et al., 2011). There are several possible mechanisms for splicing repression by Ddx1. A simple explanation could be that Ddx1 is remodeling RNA secondary structure into a form that is refractory to splicing. Alternatively, recent studies have shown a strong relationship between antisense non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and alternative splicing in humans (Morrissy et al., 2011). As DDX1 has RNA/RNA unwinding activity, Drosophila Ddx1 may act by unwinding dsRNA formed by ncRNAs bound to mRNA molecules. While it is still not clear whether ncRNAs promote or repress specific splice sites, it is possible that they may act in either fashion, depending on where they bind to target RNAs.",

We propose that Sirup\u2019s unspliced form is required for steady state metabolic function. The unspliced form of Sirup retains an early stop codon that produces a transcript that encodes a short 36 aa product missing conserved domains required for succinate dehydrogenase activity. However, there is evidence suggesting that this stop codon undergoes read-through by ribosomes, thereby generating a 145 aa length protein in spite of the stop codon (Dunn et al., 2013). Under stress conditions, suppression of Ddx1 activity may promote splicing of Sirup mRNA thereby generating a shorter 118 aa product that has reduced succinate dehydrogenase activity. The resulting slowdown in mitochondrial function would reduce resource usage by the cell, allowing it to survive periods of nutrient scarcity. Under this model, the observed epistatic lethality in Ddx1\nAX/AX/Sirup knock-down flies would be the result of a reduction in the amount of Sirup mRNA expressed combined with production of the less efficient form of Sirup protein.",

(B) RT-PCR analysis of control and null larvae and adult flies. A spliced Sirup product is only observed in Ddx1 null animals. (C) IP using anti-Ddx1 antibody demonstrating that almost all Ddx1 protein is retained in the immunoprecipitate. (D, E) Left panels \u2013 RT-PCR analysis of RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Ddx1 or IgG. Right panels \u2013 RT-PCR of cDNA generated from control flies used as a positive control for the PCR reaction. Sirup mRNA results indicate that Sirup RNA, but not Ddx1 RNA, is pulled down with Ddx1 protein. (F) RT-PCR analysis shows reduced Sirup RNA levels in Sirup knock-down adult flies. (G) Progeny generated from y1w*; Actin5C-Gal4/CyO; Ddx1AX/TM3, Sb x y1w*; UAS-Sirup-RNAi; Ddx1AX/TM3, Ser GFP crosses. Expected ratios of 2:1 for heterozygous to homozygous mutant Ddx1 and 1:1 for Sirup knock-down to CyO. A significant reduction in the number of Sirup knock-down flies was observed. Chi square analysis comparing observed distribution to expected distribution was used to determine significance.",
