These data come from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate, traffic and flight information, posts to social media sites (Twitter and Facebook are popular examples), digital pictures and videos (YouTube users upload 72 hours of new video content per minute [2]), transaction records, and cell phone GPS signals, to name a few. The classic methods, algorithms, frameworks, and tools for data management have become both inadequate for processing this amount of data and unable to offer effective solutions for managing the data growth. The problem of managing and extracting useful knowledge from these data sources is currently one of the most popular topics in computing research [3], [4].",

Both definitions refer to the three basic features of big data: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. Other organisations, and big data practitioners (e.g., researchers, engineers, and so on), have extended this 3V model to a 4V model by including a new \u201cV\u201d: Value [7]. This model can be even extended to 5Vs if the concepts of Veracity is incorporated into the big data definition.",

These concepts can be briefly described as follows [5], [7]:\u2022\nVolume: refers to large amounts of any kind of data from any different sources, including mobile digital data creation devices and digital devices. The benefit from gathering, processing, and analysing these large amounts of data generates a number of challenges in obtaining valuable knowledge for people and companies (see Value feature).\u2022\nVelocity: refers to the speed of data transfers. The data\u2019s contents are constantly changing through the absorption of complementary data collections, the introduction of previous data or legacy collections, and the different forms of streamed data from multiple sources. From this point of view, new algorithms and methods are needed to adequately process and analyse the online and streaming data.\u2022\nVariety: refers to different types of data collected via sensors, smartphones or social networks, such as videos, images, text, audio, data logs, and so on. Moreover, these data can be structured (such as data from relational databases) or unstructured in format.\u2022\nValue: refers to the process of extracting valuable information from large sets of social data, and it is usually referred to as big data analytics. Value is the most important characteristic of any big-data-based application, because it allows to generate useful business information.\u2022\nVeracity: refers to the correctness and accuracy of information. Behind any information management practice lie the core doctrines of data quality, data governance, and metadata management, along with considerations of privacy and legal concerns.\n",

This issue has generated a large number of open problems and challenges on social big data domain related to different aspects as knowledge representation, data management, data processing, data analysis, and data visualisation [17]. Some of these challenges include accessing to very large quantities of unstructured data (management issues), determination of how much data is enough for having a large quantity of high quality data (quality versus quantity), processing of data stream dynamically changing, or ensuring the enough privacy (ownership and security), among others. However, given the very large heterogeneous dataset from social media, one of the major challenges is to identify the valuable data and how analyse them to discover useful knowledge improving decision making of individual users and companies [18].",

The intersections between these clusters reflect the concept of mixing those areas. For example, the intersection between big data and data analysis shows some machine learning frameworks that have been designed on top of big data technologies (Mahoot [21], MLBase [23], [24], or SparkMLib [22]). The intersection between data analysis and social media represents the concept of current Web-based applications that intensively use social media information, such as applications related to marketing and e-health that are described in Section 4. The intersection between big data and social media is reflected in some social media applications such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Youtube that are currently using big data technologies (MongoDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, and so on) to develop their Web systems.

This programming paradigm and its related algorithms [27], were developed to provide significant improvements in large-scale data-intensive applications in clusters [28]. The programming model implemented by MapReduce is based on the definition of two basic elements: mappers and reducers. The idea behind this programming model is to design map functions (or mappers) that are used to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, after which the reduce functions will merge (reduce can be used as a shuffling or combining function) all of the intermediate values that are associated with the same intermediate key. The key aspect of the MapReduce algorithm is that if every map and reduce is independent of all other ongoing maps and reduces, then the operations can be run in parallel on different keys and lists of data.",

The Map() code is run exactly once for each K1 key value, generating output that is organised by key values K2. A master node arranges it so that for redundant copies of input data only one is processed.3.The Shuffle() step: The map output is sent to the reduce processors, which assign the K2 key value that each processor should work on, and provide that processor with all of the map-generated data associated with that key value, such that all data belonging to one key are located on the same worker node.4.The Reduce() step: Worker nodes process each group of output data (per key) in parallel, executing the user-provided Reduce() code; each function is run exactly once for each K2 key value produced by the map step.5.Produce the final output: The MapReduce system collects all of the reduce outputs and sorts them by K2 to produce the final outcome.\n",

This not only offers reliability without the need for RAID-controlled disks but also allows for multiple locations to run the mapping. If a machine with one copy of the data is busy or offline, another machine can be used. A job scheduler (in Hadoop, the JobTracker) keeps track of which MapReduce jobs are executing; schedules individual maps; reduces intermediate merging operations to specific machines; monitors the successes and failures of these individual tasks; and works to complete the entire batch job. The HDFS and the job scheduler can be accessed by the processes and programs that need to read and write data and to submit and monitor the MapReduce jobs. However, Hadoop presents a number of limitations:1.For maximum parallelism, you need the maps and reduces to be stateless, to not depend on any data generated in the same MapReduce job. You cannot control the order in which the maps run or the reductions.2.Hadoop is very inefficient (in both CPU time and power consumed) if you are repeating similar searches repeatedly. A database with an index will always be faster than running a MapReduce job over un-indexed data. However, if that index needs to be regenerated whenever data are added, and data are being added continually, MapReduce jobs may have an edge.3.In the Hadoop implementation, reduce operations do not take place until all of the maps have been completed (or have failed and been skipped). As a result, you do not receive any data back until the entire mapping has finished.4.There is a general assumption that the output of the reduce is smaller than the input to the map. That is, you are taking a large data source and generating smaller final values.\n",

Initially, every vertex is active, and for each superstep, every active vertex invokes the \u201cCompute Method\u201d that will implement the graph algorithm that will be executed. This means that the algorithms implemented using Giraph are vertex oriented. Apache Hama does not only allow users to work with Pregel-like graph applications. This computing engine can also be used to perform compute-intensive general scientific applications and machine learning algorithms.

The goal of the community detection problem is similar to the idea of graph partitioning in graph theory [45], [46]. A cluster in a graph can be easily mapped into a community. Despite the ambiguity of the community definition, numerous techniques have been used for detecting communities. Random walks, spectral clustering, modularity maximization, and statistical mechanics have all been applied to detecting communities [46]. These algorithms are typically based on the topology information from the graph or network. Related to graph connectivity, each cluster should be connected; that is, there should be multiple paths that connect each pair of vertices within the cluster. It is generally accepted that a subset of vertices forms a good cluster if the induced sub-graph is dense and there are few connections from the included vertices to the rest of the graph [47]. Considering both connectivity and density, a possible definition of a graph cluster could be a connected component or a maximal clique [48]. This is a sub-graph into which no vertex can be added without losing the clique property.",

These kinds of techniques are the starting point for a number of text mining algorithms. A usual model for representing the content of documents or text is the vector space model. In this model, each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of remaining terms within the document [60]. The term frequency (TF) is a function that relates the number of occurrences of the particular word in the document divided by the number of words in the entire document. Another function that is currently used is the inverse document frequency (IDF); typically, documents are represented as TF-IDF feature vectors. Using this data representation, a document represents a data point in n-dimensional space where n is the size of the corpus vocabulary.",

A text document corpus can be represented as a large sparse TF-IDF matrix, and applying dimensionality reduction methods to represent the data in compressed format [63] can be very useful. Latent semantic indexing [64] is an automatic indexing method that projects both documents and terms into a low-dimensional space that attempts to represent the semantic concepts in the document. This method is based on the singular value decomposition of the term-document matrix, which constructs a low-ranking approximation of the original matrix while preserving the similarity between the documents. Another family of dimension reduction techniques is based on probabilistic topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [65]. This technique provides the mechanism for identifying patterns of term co-occurrence and using those patterns to identify coherent topics. Standard LDA implementations of the algorithm read the documents of the training corpus numerous times and in a serial way. However, new, efficient, parallel implementations of this algorithm have appeared [66] in attempts to improve its efficiency.",

These techniques can automatically organise a document corpus into clusters or similar groups based on a blind search in an unlabelled data collection, grouping the data with similar properties into clusters without human supervision. Generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two types [67]: partitioning algorithms that divide a document corpus into a given number of disjoint clusters that are optimal in terms of some predefined criteria functions [68] and hierarchical algorithms that group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure or a dendrogram [69]. Both types of clustering algorithms have strengths and weaknesses depending on the structure and characteristics of the dataset used. In Zhao and Karypis [70], a comparative assessment of different clustering algorithms (partitioning and hierarchical) was performed using different similarity measures on high-dimensional text data. The study showed that partitioning algorithms perform better and can also be used to produce hierarchies of higher quality than those returned by the hierarchical ones.",

These fusion can be done in different ways and affect to different technologies, methods and even research areas. Two of these possible areas are Ontologies and Social Networks, next how previous areas could benefit from information fusion in social big data are briefly described:\u2022\nOntology-based fusion. Semantic heterogeneity is an important issue on information fusion. Social networks have inherently different semantics from other types of network. Such semantic heterogeneity includes not only linguistic differences (e.g., between \u2018reference\u2019 and \u2018bibliography\u2019) but also mismatching between conceptual structures. To deal with these problems, in [87] ontologies are exploited from multiple social networks, and more importantly, semantic correspondences obtained by ontology matching methods.More practically, semantic meshup applications have been illustrated. To remedy the data integration issues of the traditional web mashups, the semantic technologies uses the linked open data (LOD) based on RDF data model, as the unified data model for combining, aggregating, and transforming data from heterogeneous data resources to build linked data mashups [88].\u2022\nSocial network integration. Next issue is how to integrate the distributed social networks. As many kinds of social networking services have been developed, users are joining multiple services for social interactions with other users and collecting a large amount of information (e.g., statuses on Facebook and tweets on Twitter). An interesting framework has been proposed for a social identity matching (SIM) method across these multiple SNS [89].It means that the proposed approach can protect user privacy, because only the public information (e.g., username and the social relationships of the users) is employed to find the best matches between social identities. Particularly, cloud-based platform has been applied to build software infrastructure where the social network information can be shared and exchanged [90].\n",

Another approach that uses Twitter data is presented in Asur et al. [95] to forecast box-office revenues for movies.

In this approach, aggregated datasets are modelled as graphs that store the geospatial distribution of crime within given regions, and then these graphs are used to discover datasets that show similar geospatial distribution characteristics.

A number of mapping techniques can be used to identify crime hotspots, such as: point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and kernel density estimation (KDE), among others. Chainey et al. [101] conducted a comparative assessment of these techniques, and the results obtained showed that KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others.

Another approach to detecting fraud in real-time credit card transactions was presented by Quah and Sriganesh [104]. The system these authors proposed uses a self-organization map to filter and analyse customer behaviour to detect fraud. The main idea is to detect the patterns of the legal cardholder and of the fraudulent transactions through neural network learning and then to develop rules for these two different behaviours. One typical fraud in this area is the ATM phone scams that attempts to transfer a victims money into fraudulent accounts. In order to identify the signs of fraudulent accounts and the patterns of fraudulent transactions, Li et al. [105] applied Bayesian classification and association rules. Detection rules are developed based on the identified signs and applied to the design of a fraudulent account detection system.

They can be used to detect words related to diseases or their symptoms in published texts [108]. However, this can be difficult because the same word can refer to different things depending upon context. Furthermore, a specific disease can have multiple associated names and symptoms, which increases the complexity of the problem. Ontologies can help to automate human understanding of key concepts and the relationships between them, and they allow for achieving a certain level of filtering accuracy. In the health domain, it is necessary to identify and link term classes such as diseases, symptoms, and species in order to detect the potential focus of disease outbreaks. Currently, there are a number of available biomedical ontologies that contain all of the necessary terms.

Although both areas have been intensively studied with regard to large, distributed, heterogeneous, and streaming data fusion [144] and data visualisation and analysis [145], the current, rapid evolution of social media sources jointly with big data technologies creates some particularly interesting challenges related to:\u2022Obtaining more reliable methods for fusing the multiple features of multimedia objects for social media applications [146].\u2022Studying the dynamics of individual and group behaviour, characterising patterns of information diffusion, and identifying influential individuals in social networks and other social media-based applications [147].\u2022Identifying events [148] in social media documents via clustering and using similarity metric learning approaches to produce high-quality clustering results [149].\u2022The open problems and challenges related to visual analytics [145], especially related to the capacity to collect and store new data, are rapidly increasing in number, including the ability to analyse these data volumes[150], to record data about the movement of people and objects at a large scale [151], and to analyse spatio-temporal data and solve spatio-temporal problems in social media [152], among others.\n",
