            "text": "Influenza A viruses are notorious for antigen drift and shift for segmented negative-sense RNA genomes, and they are named according to their two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with 18 and 11 subtypes, respectively [1]. Before 1997, human infection by influenza virus was confined to H1, H2 and H3 subtypes, according to records. However, the first recorded human infection of avian influenza virus occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong, which was caused by H5N1 virus. The causal H5N1 was a reassortant with hemagglutinin (HA) from goose H5N1 and seven viral genes from other avian influenza viruses [2]. Pathogenetic and sequence analysis revealed that H5N1 belonged to the group of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) based on its lethality to chickens and polybasic amino acids at the cleavage site of HA, which allowed HA processing by ubiquitously expressed proteases [3], [4]. Since then, the HPAI H5N1 subtype has caused numerous outbreaks in poultry and more than 700 human H5N1 infection cases with about 60% mortality (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140727CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1). Moreover, similar to seasonal influenza viruses circulating in humans [5], the HPAI H5N1 subtype is genetically highly variable, and it has diversified into multiple phylogenetic clades over the past decade [6]. Hence, the development of vaccines against H5N1 influenza viruses is challenging.",

            "text": "The Asian H5N1 virus, which killed some geese, was detected in Guangdong Province, China, in 1996 [7]. In 1997, the HPAI virus subtype H5N1 caused disease in 18 patients with six deaths in Hong Kong [3]. Exposure to live poultry a week before the onset of illness was associated with disease in humans. The culling of all poultry in Hong Kong ended the first wave of H5N1, but the virus continued to circulate among avians. No further human cases occurred until 2003, when two Hong Kong residents contracted the disease, one of whom died [8]. The second wave of the Asian H5N1epidemic occurred in the winter of 2003/04 in eight Asian countries, including China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand and Vietnam. The impact was particularly severe in Thailand and Vietnam, where widespread disease was reported in poultry, as well as human case fatalities [9]. From 1997 to May 2005, H5N1 viruses were largely confined to Southeast Asia, but after they had infected wild birds in Qinghai Lake, China, they rapidly spread worldwide [10], [11]. Even though sustained human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) has not yet been described, it has been suggested in several household clusters [12], [13], [14]. In addition, several studies showed that airborne transmission of H5N1 can be achieved through adaptation in experimental tests [15], [16], [17], [18]. Therefore, H5N1 remains a critical public health concern.",

            "text": "Vaccines are the most effective way to fight against influenza pandemic. However, H5N1 poses a particular challenge to conventional inactivated influenza virus-based vaccine as a result of its poor immunogenicity [19], [20]. Even though live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are attractive for their ability to mimic the natural route of infection by which both strong systemic and mucosal immunity can be induced, LAIV is only licensed for healthy people from 2 to 49 years of age, excluding high-risk human groups. Furthermore, reversion to virulence during production may occur, and reassortment with circulating influenza viruses may happen [21]. DNA vaccine can be made rapidly and can be produced in large quantities; however, DNA vaccine alone is poorly immunogenic, and specific instrumentation is needed during immunization. Virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccines antigenically mimic native virions with intact biochemical activities. Khurana et al. showed that two doses of H5N1 VLPs at 15, 45, or 90 \u03bcg HA/dose induced hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), seroconversion rates of 40%, 57%, and 61%, and microneutralization (MN) of 39%, 52%, and 76%, respectively, in human [22], indicating that H5N1 VLP is, like H5N1 inactivated vaccine, poorly immunogenic. Even though subunit vaccines serve as a convenient method of generating large amounts of influenza vaccines for a potential pandemic, properties such as antigenicity and immunogenicity are indeed challenging [23]. However, adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccines are attractive based on self-adjuvanticity, rapid production by the egg-independent method, and administration by various routes.",

A targeted gene can be inserted into an adenovirus genome and expressed after recombinant adenovirus (rAd) infection (Fig. 1\n). Based on the deletion of adenovirus genome sequence, three generations of rAd are established. In the first generation, replacement of the E1 or E1/E3 gene of the adenovirus genome with a gene encoding an antigen of interest renders virus replication incompetent, but able to be produced and propagated in HEK 293 or PER.C6 cells, allowing for expression of the gene of interest by the recombinant virus upon infection [24]. In order to increase cloning capacity, prolong gene expression, and reduce toxicity associated with adenovirus backbone gene expression, the second generation of rAd was developed by further deletion of E2 or E4 gene stably expressed in the production cells [25]. The third generation of rAd is helper virus-dependent and lacks nearly all viral encoding sequences, except packaging signal and two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), enlarging cloning capacity, but reducing immunogenicity for gene therapy [26]. However, the first generation of rAd is widely used for its ease of manufacture, including production and purification, compared to the other two generations.",

Adenoviruses can infect various types of cells, such as epithelial cells, macrophage cells and dendritic cells. As shown in Fig. 2\n, upon infection, adenoviruses activate innate immunity in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent manner, as well as TLR-independent pathways, causing upregulation of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines [27]. It was reported that neutralizing antibodies to type I IFNs could block innate and adaptive immune responses to adenoviral vectors, which showed that the induction of type I IFNs plays an important role in the adjuvanticity of adenoviruses [28]. After endocytosis of adenovirus, the genome can be recognized by TLR9, which leads to the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) that promotes the induction of type I IFNs [29]. Cytosolic adenovirus genome can be recognized by DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and another unknown DNA sensor that leads to activation of IRF3 and IRF7 [30], [31], respectively, adding to the induction of type I IFNs to promote both cellular and humoral immune response.",

In 2006, Gao et al. first reported that adenovirus serotype 5-based vectors, which expressed codon-optimized hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1) influenza virus were prepared within 36 days after acquiring the virus sequence. Intramuscularly vaccinated mice were fully protected from challenge with the homologous virus. In addition, chickens, which had played a critical role as mediator in transmitting H5N1 to human, were completely protected from lethal challenge after a single subcutaneous immunization of the adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccine [32]. Later, it was reported that a single-dose in ovo vaccination with a human adenovirus vector encoding an H5N9 avian influenza virus HA not only fully protected against homologous virus, but also provided 68% protection against H5N1, demonstrating that adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccine could be administered en masse, using available robotic in ovo injectors [33]. The combination of different HAs in adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccine was also studied. Hoelscher et al. revealed that mice vaccinated with two adenovirus vaccines encoding hemagglutinins from clade 1 and clade 2 of H5N1 viruses were protected against both viruses with minimal interference against each other [34]. In addition, adenovirus-based multivalent vaccines encoding hemagglutinins from H5, H7 and H9 were broadly protective, and significantly high levels of HA stalk-specific antibodies were induced following immunization with the multivalent vaccines [35]. Scallan et al. reported that vaccination with H5N1 adenovirus-based vaccine by the oral route protected mice and ferret upon lethal H5N1 challenge [36]. In addition, cross-clade neutralizing antibodies were induced in ferrets immunized by the peroral route. It was also reported that DNA prime-adenovirus boost vaccinations based on NP and M2 from H1N1 were superior to trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccines in protection against heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza challenge [37]. These cited studies show that adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccines are effective in preclinical research.",

In naive mice immunized with human adenovirus vector expressing H5N1 HA and boosted with bovine adenovirus vector expressing H5N1 HA, Singh et al. reported that the humoral responses were significantly higher than those with either alone [41]. However, immunity against non-human adenovirus will be induced after immunization with non-human adenovirus, a fact which should be taken into consideration for further immunization.

In order to elicit high levels of potent and durable humoral and cellular responses in the lower airways, Song et al. demonstrated that aerosolized recombinant adenovirus encoding H5HA completely protected ferrets against H5N1 [49]. The results of adenovirus vaccine-based influenza conserved protein are encouraging. Park et al. reported that mucosal immunity induced by adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccine, including H5HA and two conserved influenza proteins, M1 and M2, confers protection against a lethal H5N2 avian influenza virus challenge [50]. Importantly, a single intranasal, but not sublingual, immunization of adenovirus expressing NP from H1N1 provided 100% protection against H1N1, 100% protection against H3N2, and 40% protection against H5N1 [51]. Also, a single-dose mucosal immunization with adenovirus vaccine encoding NP and M2 provided rapid and full protection against virulent H5N1, H3N2 and H1N1 viruses [52].

Therefore, adenovirus-based H5N1 vaccines, especially mucosal vaccine, may be an effective weapon against a new outbreak of H5N1. However, problems, such as pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus and the question of whether immunity against non-human adenovirus after immunization with non-human adenovirus in human will impede further immunization, should be taken into account, and other strategies should be developed. We have previously reported that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV spike protein induced SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibody with neutralizing activity [55], [56]. Other studies suggested that activation of the immune system by the transgene product following AAV-mediated gene transfer might be easier to control than that following adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, indicating that AAV-based vaccines lead to mild immune response [57].
