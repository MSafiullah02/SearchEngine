A. baumannii has emerged as a serious cause of nosocomial infections, especially among critically ill patients in intensive care units, causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), septicemia, secondary meningitis, endocarditis, infections of the skin, soft tissues, urinary tract and those originating from prosthetic devices [2]. Due to the rapid development of resistance to various antibiotics, only a few antibiotics provide effective treatment caused by this pathogen. For example, carbapenems have been one of the main antimicrobial classes used against A. baumannii infections, but the emergence and dissemination of carbapenemases have diminished the utility of this class of drugs from an already limited list of existing treatment options. In 2017, WHO published a list of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens for which new antibiotics are urgently needed and the most critical group is carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB). Among the alternatives for the treatment of infections due to CRAB, polymyxins and other non-\u03b2-lactam agents may be valuable options [3\u20136].",

However, AMPs have disadvantages such as having complex structures, difficult synthesis and purification mechanisms, and short half-lives due to proteases [7, 8]. Ceragenins have been developed as a result of studies to develop non-peptide derivatives of AMPs and thus reduce their disadvantages [8]. Ceragenins, which are membrane active molecules, combine with the cell surfaces of microorganisms and cause depolarization and death. Only a few studies have been reported in which the potential activities of ceragenins CSA-13 and CSA-131 have been evaluated against CRAB alone or in combination with other antibiotics [10\u201316]. However, there are no published studies describing the activities of ceragenins CSA-8, CSA-44 and CSA-138 against CRAB.",

In the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in CRAB [22]. Therefore, in order to take the microorganism under control, selection of the antimicrobial agents is extremely important. Ceragenins are a group of cholic acid derivatives that have potent activities against various microorganisms. Recently, it is documented that CSA-13 and CSA-131 are active both against colistin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains [9\u201316]. Villa-Farres et al. showed that CSA-13 and CSA-131 showed good activity against resistant-A. baumannii, with a 2 mg/L of MIC50 value [16]. In this study, the MIC50 values of the studied antibiotics were ranked as follows: colistin > CSA-131 > CSA-13 = CSA-138 > CSA-44 > CSA-8. It is thought that CSA-131 has the best activity because it has long hydrophobic chain at C12 carbon (Fig. 6). The MICs and MBCs of the CSA-13 and CSA-131 are closer to those of colistin. The current results are similar to those reported by Bozkurt-Guzel et al. [9] and Villa-Farres et al. [16] Regarding all tested CSAs, the results obtained reaffirm the good activity of these compounds except CSA-8 against CRAB, highlighting CSA-13 and CSA-131 as the best compounds, with lower MICs against all of the strains (Table 1). We found the highest MIC results with CSA-8. MIC ranges of CSA-44 and CSA-138 are almost the same. Our study also shows that CSA-13, CSA-44 and CSA-138 have an MIC50/MBC50 ratio of 1, suggesting that the bactericidal activity is close to the inhibitory concentration.",
