When individuals improve their relationship to their inner self, their ability to feel and express compassion for others emerges. This improvement is enabled by a growing desire to help others without expecting something in return, 1 combined with the growing understanding that all people, no matter their level of wealth, health, or literacy, have the power and responsibility to influence their circumstances. This changed perception of the self and others results in changed meso-systems. In turn, these transformed meso-levels impact the individual's subjective and objective well-being (Summers et al. 2012 ). The situation deriving from COVID-19 illustrates how fragile the Society that we all live in is. And how interconnected we are. Carefully and systematically nurturing micro, meso and macro environments that are conducive to the common good has never been as crucially relevant to our individual and collective survival as today.",

Researchers found a direct correlation between mindfulness practices and the increase of brain muscles within the brain/precuneus (Kurth et al. 2014) , raising the subjective happiness scores of those who conduct practices (Sato et al. 2015) . Science also indicates that connecting people to a purpose beyond their personal interests, such as taking action to help others, boosts their performance and overall contentment (Hagel et al. 2017) . Mindful interactions following meditation resulted in improved working relationships in corporations that offered employees this type of practice (Goodman 2013) . Taking this into account, staff meditation programs have become a standard resource at many leading corporations. 2 It remains to be seen when aid organizations will get on the bandwagon. Seeing that such organizations' mission is, in the simplest terms, to make the World a 'happier' place, it seems logical that they must begin from within by investing in their staff's well-being. Nothing can be shared outside without first being found inside. Various researchers have shown that humanitarian aid workers face increased risk of various personal challenges including anxiety, burnout, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hazardous alcohol consumption. 3 Despite such findings, so far neither non-governmental organizations nor the United Nations have put in place systematic programs for staff care and well-being in the field or at headquarters. It is important to consider the sector's efficiency, or lack thereof, in relation to the state of mind of its staff members.",

As a growing number of individuals and organizations widen their scope of attention beyond their immediate interests to the environment within which they operate, the weight of addressing issues becomes a shared burden that is lighter on everyone. Suddenly, challenges that previously seemed insurmountable feel less daunting, and they gradually become solvable. As individuals' emotional stability increases, they become sources of harmony in their families, communities, and Societies. This gradually increases the ability of these 'meso-systems' to withstand hardship. So-called resilience involves individual and environmental factors. It begins inside and is nurtured outside because individuals are connected and mutually dependent.",

Creating a nurturing Society is a slow and gradual process, just like all other natural processes. Nature does not reach its ideal outcomes when someone pulls a seedling up from the ground and stretches it to grow faster, but rather when one patiently cultivates the soil below, providing nutrients while respecting the plant's space and growth speed.",

            "text": "From a mental perspective, a fulfilling life requires both happiness and meaning, two aspects that overlap only partially (Baumeister et al. 2013 ). Satisfaction of one's needs and wants increases happiness but is largely irrelevant to meaningfulness. Happiness is largely oriented toward the present, whereas meaningfulness involves integrating the past, present, and future. Happiness is frequently linked to being a taker rather than a giver. Meaningfulness is associated with being a giver rather than a taker. Personal identity and self-expression contribute to meaning but not to happiness. Action undertaken for others out of genuine compassion results in deep and lasting satisfaction because contributing to a cause beyond the personal ego generates happiness, a sense of meaning, and a feeling that one's wants have been satisfied. From a psychological perspective, human beings are driven by the quest for meaning. 5 Contributing to a cause greater than one's own interest is a precondition for the subjective perception of a fulfilling life. 6 Humans strive for internal consistency. If one's thoughts, words, and action are in dissonance, one experiences subjective unhappiness even if objectively fulfilled in all factors of satisfaction such as health, wealth, social standing, and entertainment. An individual who experiences 'cognitive dissonance' 7 tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, becoming motivated to try to reduce this discomfort and to actively avoid situations and information deemed likely to increase the discomfort. Selfish behavior often causes dissonance, as it goes against the inherent human trait of cooperation as well as the religious values and social mores with which many are raised. Unless the individual becomes conscious of the cause of such discomfort, he/she will avoid situations and/or information that highlights the conflict between belief and action, rather than changing the related behavior (Harmon-Jones and Mills 2019).",

The individual can get the same flow of so-called pleasure hormones by alleviating someone else's suffering as from buying a new gadget or indulging in chocolate. Along the same lines, when the individual feels compassion for others, this emotion generates physiological changes conducive to making the person stay and help. This functions as an opposite to the fight-or-flight response that is activated when we feel threatened. Preparation to fight a threat or flee causes the heart and breathing rates to increase. This is an automatic reaction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), a loose association of glands, organs, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems. These systems play a vital role in regulating blood flow and breathing patterns for different kinds of actions. An individual's heart rate does not rise upon perceiving others' suffering, but rather falls below the baseline levels, preparing him/her not to fight or flee, but to approach and soothe.",

It is justified in various ways and rooted in multiple explanations. Beyond the immediate benefit of a positive action for the beneficiary, one might also consider the possibility of receiving reciprocal positive action. An individual's thoughts, words, and actions carry the seeds of his/her future (Krishan 1988 ) because everything generates energy that returns in kind. When one chooses to invest energy in others' happiness, the fruit of one's karma is happiness and success. Selfless service is a winwin-win-win.

He identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished it from the brain as the seat of intelligence. However, for some time now, there has been rising interest in the complementarity of both.

However, there are degrees and variations that derive from the individual's situation. While the fundamental needs, rights, and responsibilities are the same for all human beings, the level of responsibility and the weight of certain needs depend on individual circumstances. In this logic of interdependence between rights and responsibility, of have and have not, the rights of the disadvantaged person acquire an expanded dimension. This dimension pertains to a disadvantaged person's entitlement to a change that would restore the functionality of an unfulfilled right; this dimension correlates with a responsibility dimension that is linked to the privileges the more fortunate hold. The intensity of this responsibility dimension increases with the means of its holder. Having or acquiring possessions, power or skills, amplifies the responsibility of the privileged individual to use this advantage for the benefit of others. This inherent responsibility is not limited to the conventional pair of duty-bearer and rights-holder and cannot be transferred to the government or an institution (Walther 2014) .",

However, quantum physics offers scientific evidence that mind and matter are more than just connected; they are essentially the same thing (Atmanspacher 2004 ). The same separation in the perspective that most of us hold of ourselves, of our relationship to the institutions and communities we evolve in, and of the wider World, affects our relationship with nature with increasingly negative consequences. Everything is connected. Climate change resulting from pollution, deforestation, and overuse of natural resources is just one of many calamities that illustrate the benefit of reversing the status quo and shifting the perspective from fragmentation to unification; from 'me' to 'us'. Drawing further on this example of humans and nature, studies show that individuals who live in close connection with nature report greater self-acceptance, increased social integration, more positive emotions, and greater life satisfaction (Mayer et al. 2009; Howell et al. 2011) . Humans who have a close relationship with nature understand the immensity of the World and yet are able to relate this with feelings of personal autonomy, purpose, and growth. Indeed, the prevailing disconnect between many humans and the natural World appears to go against biophilia, humans' innate need to interact with other life-forms such as plants and animals (Wilson 1984) . Associating with nature, rather than acting as an entity that exists independently in nature, is an important component of solving social and environmental problems (Dickinson 2013 ).",

People have many different needs, ranging from food and shelter, through safety, personal growth, and love, to approval from others, self-worth, and creativity (Hultman 1979) . A person's belief system conditions the behavior one undertakes to meet these needs. Beliefs are the sum total of a person's experiences. They include all the lessons of life, including teachings about how to perceive the World and about what is right or wrong, good or bad. Over time, political systems tend to institutionalize the dominant values. Consequently, social innovation usually comes from sources outside of the prevailing governance system, such as social movements created by individuals (Castells 1972) . It is crucial to instill in individuals the belief in the fundamental importance of social responsibility and kindness to personal and collective prosperity from a young age. Children must grow up in an environment that nurtures their instinct for cooperation. Behaviors derived from this understanding result in a certain type of experience that further affirms this initial perspective. As this behavior is maintained and pursued over time, it shapes the neural set-up of the organism. In this context, the organism is the physical stage of the individual's presence in Society, and our neural set-up is both cause and consequence of our worldview.",

Acts of kindness and the pursuit of a World that covers everyone's needs are in everybody's interest, psychologically and physiologically. The more unequal a Society is, the worse everyone's place in that Society is (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009 ). As stated eloquently by Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) , there are 'pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, and encouraging excessive consumption'. They demonstrate that in more unequal countries, the quality of life is significantly lower for everyone, rich or poor. Assessed factors include physical and mental health, substance abuse, benefits of education, conflict with the law, social-mobility, community coherence and trust, levels of violence, number of unwanted teenage pregnancies, and overall child well-being. And yet action to counteract the evergrowing inequality that marks the twenty-first century has to date been inadequate. One reason for this open-eyed blindness to our circumstances may be seen in an inadequate comprehension of the deep-seated impact of inequality on individuals and Society at large (Vandermoortele 2019) By investing in inner peace, POZE is a down-payment toward collective social harmony. Awareness of the interplay between internal and external factors is an important condition for the first effective step from reflection to action, which involves thinking about reflexivity or action. The one who thinks will act to implement the learning that has resulted from that reflection and from the reactions of others to this change of direction (Soros 1987 ). This step from mind to materialization is important because the ideas generated by the process of reflection do not in and of themselves change how we act. It also matters for the one who thinks and acts, because through the physical execution of the idea, new experiences arise that result in new memories that will guide future behavior. With each new way of 'doing', a different set of neurons is activated. Repetition gradually results in a modification of the existing mental 'hardware' and the prevailing neuropathways change (Doidge 2007) . As the physical act is performed, pursuing the new mental and behavioral path becomes easier with each repetition. Eventually, this complementarity of mind and matter, of thought/belief and action, becomes permanent. Like a stone thrown into water causes ripples, a changed mindset changes the individual's behavior, which circles out toward his/her community, which is part of a country, which is part of the international community and Planet. Over 7 billion stones can ripple-up any ocean. A spiral dynamic enters in motion.",

These costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness. By behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself but boosts the number that other organisms are likely to produce. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday concept in which an action would only be called 'altruistic', if it was done with the conscious intention of helping others. In the biological sense, there is no such requirement. 13 From a Darwinian perspective, the existence of altruism seems surprising, as it puts the one who behaves altruistically at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the one which behaves selfishly. Imagine that some members of a group of Vervet monkeys give alarm calls when they see predators, but others do not. By refusing to give an alarm call, a monkey can reduce the chance that it will be attacked, while at the same time benefiting from the alarm calls of others. However, natural selection does not favor those monkeys that do not give alarm calls over those that do. Altruistic behavior has shown that individuals who act in ways that appear to be contrary to their own interests while benefiting someone else have advantages for their genetically similar kin (McAndrew 2002) .",

However, as altruistic behavior increases, the overall fitness of the group is affirmed. Groups with the highest proportion of altruists outperform the more selfish ones (Nowak and Highfield 2012) . 'Individual fitness' thus extends to embrace 'inclusive fitness' of the kin group.

Gradualism is selection and variation that happens slowly. Over a short period of time, it is hard to notice. Small variations that fit an organism slightly better to its environment are selected for: a few more individuals with more of the helpful trait survive, and a few more with less of the helpful trait die. Very slowly, in small increments, over a long time, the population changes. Change is slow, constant, and consistent. In punctuated equilibrium, change comes in spurts. There is a period of very little change, and then one or a few huge changes occur, often through mutations in the genes of a few individuals. Mutations are random changes in the DNA that are not inherited from the previous generation but are passed on to generations that follow. Though mutations are often harmful, those that result in a new punctuated equilibrium are very helpful to the individuals in their environments. Because these mutations are so different and so helpful to the survival of those that have them, the proportion of individuals in the population who have the mutation/trait increases over a very short period. The species changes rapidly (in terms of evolutionary time) and then settles down again for a comparatively long period of little change. The transformation can be either the cause of mutations or other causes, such as huge and sudden changes in the environment that result in more rapid changes in the organisms through harsher selection.",

Scientists think that species with a shorter evolution like humans evolved mostly by punctuated equilibrium, while those with a longer evolution evolved mostly by gradualism. Both contrast with the theory of variable-speed evolution, which maintains that different species evolve at different rates, and that there is no reason to stress one rate of change over another. 14 Maybe it was not either/or, but a combination, a mutation resulted in very distinct, stripe-like markings, which were then gradually 'polished up' into stripes because the marked tigers fared so much better in the survival game because they were much better disguised. The point here is that social transformation can be slow and gradual, like the shift that led many countries from the 'normality' of women as prime caretakers to the 'normality' of women as equal business partners; or it can be the result of drastic land-shifts, like the 2010 Earthquake in Haiti which led, for a short period in time, to the arousal of solidarity at mass scale.

Are we naturally selfish or do we evolve to be so, because of Society? It seems that neither position is entirely correct, and, more importantly, nothing is cast in stone. Evolutionary studies have found that genetics only partially influence altruistic behavior (Reuter et al. 2010) , whereas progress in biology, genetics, and neuroscience offer ever more evidence of the features and neuro-circuitry of the human brain which underlie our behavior in the selfish-selfless spectrum (Sonne and Gash 2018) . Today's evidence supports the idea that altruistic potential is developed as a common feature in human populations. Comparing the critical features of the social brain along the scale from selfish-selfless behavior, from unemotional psychopaths to zealous altruists who take extreme measures to help others, one can see common behavioral traits and functional neural features. Herein both, genetic inheritance and cognitive learning, play important roles. Studies of diverse population groups, including newborns, adopted children, incarcerated juveniles, twins, and mindfulness meditators, point to the central role of neuroplasticity and the dopaminergic reward systems in forming and reforming neural circuitry in response to personal experience, as well as cultural influences in determining behavior in the selfish-selfless spectrum.",

            "text": "Studies show the underlying neural circuitry differs between psychopaths and altruists, with emotional processing being profoundly muted in psychopaths and significantly enhanced in altruists. Both groups are characterized by the reward system of the brain shaping behavior. Cognitive therapy as well as social and cultural experience, combined with approaches such as mindfulness training for introspection and rewardactivating compassion, can amend the existing circuit gradually, hereby changing the behavior that is both consequence and cause of these circuits. These approaches are slowly entering the mainstream of clinical care for managing pain, depression, and stress (Sonne and Gash 2018) . Individuals, and hereby populations can migrate from one side of the behavioral spectrum to the other, in response to a holistic approach that addresses the four dimensions that make up who and how they are. As stated by Gould, 'Our genetic makeup permits a wide range of behaviors'-from altruism to xenophobia, from ego-centricity to extreme generosity. Upbringing, culture, class, status, and all the intangibles that we call \"free will\" determine how we restrict our behaviors from the wide spectrum-extreme altruism to extreme selfishness-that our genes permit (Gould 1977) .",

Finally, within the triple reflexive, the person understands that he/she is not bound to respond either way but can act in a manner that promotes cooperation within a group or build companionship with those who could have been taken advantage of. This outlook allows the emergence of a differentiated set of economic players with drastically different preferences.

This image of intrinsic connection of everything and everyone echoes the understanding of ancient philosophers and scientists, underpinning religions across the World. It has found its scientific expression in 'Chaos theory' which points out the sensitive dependence of a phenomenon on initial conditions.

Human consciousness of some areas, without awareness of the bigger picture, and chosen blindness to the multiplicity of factors that are involved in our existence, leads us to unknowingly, intentionally, or recklessly disturb the laws that underpin the Universe. The bee does not visit flowers in order to carry pollen from one flower to the next; rather, these visits serve to collect honey; still, the consequence is that pollen is carried from one flower to the next, which enables the visited flowers to evolve and become fruits.

Most changes that occur in our lives do not happen in order to make us reset our behavior. It is because they do occur that we adapt, change, and grow. Becoming aware of this unfolding flow does not equal control over it, but awareness of this flow is the first step toward understanding it. An understanding of the dynamics that shape our existence is needed to eventually influence them. Awareness to the spirals that never cease to turn in either direction opens our senses.

Studies suggest that compassion may be self-perpetuating: Being compassionate causes a chemical reaction in the body that motivates an individual to be even more compassionate. When people perform behaviors associated with compassion (warm smiles, friendly hand gestures, affirmative forward leaning, etc.), their bodies produce more oxytocin, a hormone that promotes long-term bonds and commitments, as well as nurturing behavior-like care for offspring. See Keltner (2004 Kashdan et al. (2008) . 7. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, and performs an action that is contradictory to one or more beliefs, ideas, or values, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values. Refer to Festinger's (1962) . 8. Refer to information regarding Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen of Princeton University in Keltner (2004) . 9. Refer to James Rilling and Gregory Berns of Emory University in Keltner (2004) . 10. Breathing affects the brain through signals carried by the vagus nerve. Not only does the vagus nerve send signals down to the heart, but it also carries signals up into the brain stem. Vagus nerve signaling activates circuits for resting and relaxation, known as the parasympathetic nervous system.",

Slow breathing increases activity in the vagus nerve and pushes the brain toward parasympathetic activity. On the other hand, fast shallow breathing increases excitement and anxiety. See Korb (2015) . 11. Current thinking relies mostly on a dualistic perspective, whereby mind and body, individual and Society, tangible and intangible, inside and outside are separated. Mind-body dualism considers the mind and the body as distinct and separable. It encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and between subject and object, and is contrasted with physicalism and enactivism. Aristoteles shared Plato's view of various souls and explained hierarchy with distinctive functions for plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only. For him, all three souls perish when the living organism dies, whereas for Plato the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body, which corresponds to the belief of reincarnation found in Buddhism and Hinduism. 12. See in particular Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including Art. 22, Art. 26. 13. Some of the most interesting examples of biological altruism are found among creatures that are (presumably) not capable of conscious thought at all, e.g., insects. For the biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed. Altruistic behavior is common throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with complex social structures. For example, vampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members of their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not starve. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in raising its young from other 'helper' birds, who protect the nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. In social insect colonies (ants, wasps, bees, and termites), sterile workers devote their whole lives to caring for the queen, constructing and protecting the nest, foraging for food, and tending the larvae. 14. While Darwin is mostly quoted as seeing evolution as long, slow, and gradual, it should be noted that he did not put everything in the same box of speed. In the first edition of On the Origin of Species, Darwin stated that 'Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree'; he refined this in the fifth edition writing that 'the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the",

SeeBicchieri (2006). 5. SeeViktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning (1985), as well as version from Frankl with Lasch's translation(1992). Note-Predecessors of Frankl argued that the driving force is pleasure (Carl Jung) or power (Adolf Adler). 6. \"Years of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.\" Refer to",
