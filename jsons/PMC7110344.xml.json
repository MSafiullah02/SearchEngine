            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with high fever, malaise, headache, dry cough and generalized, interstitial infiltrates in the lung, is caused by a novel virus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lee et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003; Hsueh et al., 2004). SARS-CoV is rapidly transmitted through aerosols, and caused 8447 reported cases with 811 deaths worldwide during a short period from February to June 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003). Around 20% of SARS cases developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Pathological examination of the lung indicated that bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, multinucleated syncytial cells and squamous metaplasia were found in lung tissues of SARS patients (Lang et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003). Abnormal laboratory findings in SARS patients included lymphopenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and an increase in aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in serum (Wang et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV particles contain a single positive-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 30 kb in length and has a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 polyA tract (Enjuanes et al., 2000; Holmes, 2001; Lai & Holmes, 2001). The SARS-CoV genome encodes for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid. The replicase gene encodes two large overlapping polypeptides (replicase 1a and 1ab, c. 450 and c. 750 kDa, respectively), including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase for viral replication and transcription (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). SARS-CoV replicates in Vero-E6 cells with cytopathic effects (Ng et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2004), and also induces AKT signalling-mediated cell apoptosis (Mizutani et al., 2004). Recently, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) protein has been demonstrated to induce actin reorganization and apoptosis in COS-1 monkey kidney cells by down-regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and up-regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (Surjit et al., 2004). As the 3C protease of the picornaviruses poliovirus, enterovirus 71 and rhinovirus induces cell apoptosis (Li et al., 2002; Calandria et al., 2004; Funkhouser et al., 2004), the possible role of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in virus-induced apoptosis is of interest.",

This result demonstrates a significant inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV 3CLpro on the growth of human promonocyte cells. In addition, annexin V staining indicated a significant difference in the percentage of apoptotic cells between 3CLpro-expressing cells (20%) and mock cells (3%) (Figs 3b and c). SARS-CoV 3CLpro-induced apoptosis was also measured with a fluorimetric caspase profiling assay (Figs 4a and b). Caspase-3 activity in 3CLpro-expressing cells was 3.04-fold greater than that in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor and 2.1-fold greater than that in mock cells (Fig. 4a). Caspase-9 activity in 3CLpro-expressing cells was about 1.3-fold greater than that in mock cells and in the presence of the caspase-9 inhibitor (Fig. 4b).

            "text": "SARS-CoV 3CLpro caused a significant increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells (Fig. 5) which, in turn, were involved in 3CLpro-induced apoptosis. Recently, ROS-mediated apoptosis has also been reported in viral infections, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (Lin et al., 2004a) and influenza virus (Uchide et al., 2002). In vivo signalling pathway assay indicated that 3CLpro increased the activation of the NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter, but inhibited AP1-dependent transcription (Fig. 6). This finding indicates that NF-\u03baB, but not c-Jun, is involved in 3CLpro-induced apoptosis of human promonocyte cells. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is produced in response to oxidative stress, being widely proposed to be involved in the mediation or prevention of apoptosis, and ROS serve as second messengers in the induction of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB (Bonizzi et al., 1999). The activation of an NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene induced by SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig. 6) was correlated with an increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells. Consensus NF-\u03baB sites exist in the promoters of apoptosis-related genes and proinflammatory genes (Chen et al., 2001), such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8. Interestingly, TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 are greatly increased in the acute phase sera of SARS patients (Huang et al., 2005). Therefore, the activation of the NF-\u03baB signal transduction pathway induced by SARS-CoV 3CLpro could be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS.",
