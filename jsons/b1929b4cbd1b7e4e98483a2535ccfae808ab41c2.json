            "text": "Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.",

The model is implemented as an interactive Microsoft Windows application, as a web tool online (summaries only), and the source code is freely available at GitHub. In this article, the model is presented for the state of Massachusetts (United States), but can be easily adopted to other administrative districts, areas and territories where the demographics and population characteristics of the reported cases are known. After calibration, the model predicts the morbidity and mortality of the epidemic as it spreads with different quarantine parameters, which lead to reduction of social contact probabilities between individuals. The model outputs for different quarantine start dates and durations are then summarized and compared to actual disease incidence. These summaries demonstrate the effectiveness of the early quarantine measures on the reduction of the number of new infections and deaths. The model framework can also be adopted for use in future decision making process for government and health officials as plans to cease or ease quarantines continue to evolve using the interactive application. : medRxiv preprint 251 April 26, 2020. For the first scenario the model predicts 24, 039 cumulative cases (with 252 the 90% PI (20, 665; 27, 296)), for the second scenario the model predicts 56, 587 253 cumulative cases (with the 90% PI (46, 944; 66, 401)), and for the thirds scenario the 254 model predicts 123, 351 cumulative cases (with the 90% PI (100, 113; 144, 018)).",

Despite the unprecedented 3 efforts from Chinese authorities including the complete lockdown of the entire city of 4 Wuhan on January 22, 2020 the virus has rapidly spread to all continents except 5 Antarctica. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the coronavirus a 6 global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [5] , only three months after the first case was 7 detected. The novel coronavirus is now officially named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease 8 caused by it has been called COVID-19 [6] to distinguish from SARS-CoV and the 9 corresponding severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic from 2003 [7] [8]. 10 Despite the much lower case-fatality rate, SARS-CoV-2 has caused morbidity and 11 mortality orders of magnitude higher than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 12 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) combined [9] . As of May 13, 2020, more 13 than 4.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with more than 287, 000 14 deaths due to complications of COVID-19 [10] . As of May, 2020 there is neither an 15 effective virus-specific treatment, nor Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 16 vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2 [11] [12] [13] [14] . As such, social distancing and 17 quarantine are the only available measures to reduce the transmission and prevent 18 overwhelming the capacity of existing healthcare systems. Starting at the epicenter of 19 Hubei province [15] in January, 2020, governments around the world have implemented 20 society lockdown measures of varying degrees [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since such measures 21 remain the only available tools to control the spread of the pandemic, it is critical to 22 understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This would 23 allow for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time under different 24 mitigation strategies, which could be implemented to reduce morbidity and mortality; 25 as well as the allocation of limited resources to medical providers. 26 To achieve this goal, multiple approaches can be implemented that are typically 27 driven by the quality and precision of the available data. The most commonly reported 28 data for epidemics are the incidence of new cases and deaths represented as a time 29 series over the fixed intervals (e.g. days or weeks) aggregated across multiple regions 30 and reporting sources [21] [22] [23] . This aggregated data can be used for incidence 31 curve reconstruction, modeling, and prediction when more detailed information about 32 each infected individual is not available [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Such models are called 33 May 17, 2020 2/14 compartmental models [29] where the study population is divided into groups while 34 individuals within each group are assumed to have the same characteristics of interest 35 (e.g. susceptible, infected, vaccinated, or immune). The compartmental models are 36 formulated via a defined system of differential equations that allows for both 37 deterministic and stochastic formulations to quantify the uncertainty of the model fit. 38 Those models provide insight into the underlying epidemic dynamics and allow for the can also be depersonalized in accordance to HIPAA regulations [35] to make the use of 70 the model versatile and not to violate the privacy of individuals.

The individuals from the reported set D that are defined in (4) are assigned to 178 the local epicenters of the future epidemic E i for i = 1, 2, . . . , I based on the 179 available (from the input data) geographic distribution. The geographic data about the areas of high density P j for j = 1, 2, . . . , J are 181 incorporated into the model. The model is initialized with the index cases from D. Based on those index cases 183 that are defined in (4) the initial infection time T min is determined. This step is 184 necessary to incorporate the infection times that have been present before the first 185 reporting timet 1 into the model. The final time point of the stochastic simulations T max is define by the user based 187 on the desired study and prediction goals. The initial list of infected individuals L(T min ) is initialized at time T min only 189 with the earliest model input cases from the list D(T min ). The infected list of individuals L(t + 1) for the time slot t + 1 is generated 191 sequentially for all t \u2208 [T min ; T max \u2212 1] based on the list of individuals L(t) from 192 previous time slot t and the individual's characteristics within the list L(t + 1) are 193 updated at this time step t + 1. The details of the new infection generations are 194 provided in S1 Appendix. 195 Based on the lists L(t) at every time slot t \u2208 [T min ; T max ] the infected modeled 196 population summaries can be computed and summarized. In particular, the total 197 number of currently infected but not identified individuals (i.e. those with the status 198 st(t) = 1) is saved into Inf (t) variable for every t. The total number of treated or 199 quarantined individuals (i.e. with the status st(t) = 2) is saved into T reat(t) variable 200 for every t. The total number of recovered individuals (i.e. with the status st(t) = 2) is 201 saved into Recov(t) variable for every t. The total number of deceased individuals (i.e. 202 with the status st(t) = 4) is saved into Dead(t) variable for every t.
