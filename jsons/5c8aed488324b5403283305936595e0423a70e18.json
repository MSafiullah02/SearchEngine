In this context, young subjects at increased risk of cardiovascular events such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) subjects may have deleterious consequences by COVID-19 [2] . Of note, COVID-19 may induce lipid abnormalities as previously described during Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection [3] ; thus, the increased cumulative cholesterol burden may further exacerbate the cardiovascular risk of FH subjects. In this context, the adherence and intensification of lipid lowering therapies is necessary to adequately reduce cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic subjects.",

Of note, Glende et al. showed that cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains facilitated the interaction between the surface glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [5] . Moreover, after cellular entry, RNA virus require a high amount of intracellular cholesterol and fatty acids for the formation of the replication complex; in particular, Soto-Acosta et al. showed a high amount of cellular cholesterol correlated with an increased activity of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) during a RNA virus infection (HMGCR) [6] . In this context, lipid-lowering therapies may have a double benefical effect in hypercholesterolemic subjects by reducing the cardiovascular risk and interfering with COVID-19.",

PCSK9 inhibitors specifically bind and inhibit the circulating protein PCSK9; thus, PCSK9 inhibitors block LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation by PCSK9 and enhance LDLR expression on the hepatocyte surface. Concerning the impact of PCSK9 levels on viral infection, it was shown that PCSK9 promoted the degradation of LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) [9] . Of note, Gudleski-O'Regan et al. demonstrated that an increased LRP1 expression was associated with a reduced Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infectivity by depleting intracellular cholesterol in CMV-infected fibroblasts; thus, a higher LRP1 expression may be a defense response to virus infection [10] . In opposite, by inducing LRP1 degradation, PCSK9 may increase the viral infectivity and its inhibition may be useful to interfere with the infectivity of several virus such as COVID-19. In line with these considerations, PCSK9 inhibition was not associated with an increased risk of virus infection in clinical trials. It may be interesting to evaluate the impact of PCSK9-inhibitors on morbidity and prognosis of hypercholesterolemic subjects infected by COVID-19 .",
