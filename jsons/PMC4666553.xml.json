Originating in monkeys, dengue viruses were transmitted to humans between 100\u2013800 years ago, and dengue remained a relatively minor and geographically restricted disease until the 1950s when epidemics occurred in the Philippines and Thailand 3., 4.. Dengue has emerged as a worldwide problem, with a 30-fold increase in incidence globally in the past 50 years (\nFig. 2) [4]. Today, dengue is regarded as the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease of humans [4]. It is found in at least 100 tropical and subtropical countries, including countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, the western Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean, and the eastern Mediterranean regions 3., 5.. More than one-third of the world\u2019s population lives in areas at risk of infection with dengue virus [3], and a recent estimate using cartographic approaches in 2013 showed that 390 million people have dengue virus infections per year, of which 96 million cases manifest symptoms worldwide [6].",

Due to the severe muscle, joint and bone pains, dengue is also known as \u2018\u2018break bone fever\u2019\u2019. Most dengue patients recover after a few days, but some DF patients develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are severe and sometimes fatal forms of the disease [7]. About three quarters of dengue infections can be asymptomatic, especially in children and those with previous dengue infection, but they can still infect mosquitoes 3., 7.. However, secondary dengue infection is one of the two factors thought to be associated with increased risk of disease severity; the other factor is infection by particularly virulent strains of dengue viruses [8].",

The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden is poorly known, and the greatest uncertainties in national burden estimates are in India, Indonesia, Brazil, and China [6]. The economic burden of dengue on both governments and individuals is high. Based on a systematic review analysis, the estimated cost of dengue disease in the Americas including North America, Central America and Mexico, the Andean region, Brazil, the Southern cone, and the Caribbean region is 2.1 billion USD per year on average, excluding cost on vector control [9]. Another 12-country economic analysis also showed high dengue burden in Southeast Asia, with an annual average of 950 million USD resulted from 2.9 million dengue episodes and 5,906 deaths [10].

In 2005, China established a national monitoring program for DF in humans and vector monitoring in Aedes mosquitoes, focusing on five provinces (Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangxi Autonomous Region, and Hainan) with 16 national monitoring sites. Other efforts that China has made to prevent and control dengue include control of mosquito vector density, enhanced surveillance for imported cases, improvement of diagnosis and treatment, enhancing the cooperation among the related different public health departments and neighboring countries, and engaging communities to combat the epidemic 11., 12.. In response to the dengue outbreak in 2014, four technical guidelines [13], including surveillance of DF cases, laboratory tests and diagnosis, surveillance of dengue vectors, and control of dengue vectors, were developed and issued by China CDC, together with the previous two dengue guidelines (Diagnosis and Treatment of Dengue Fever in 2014 and Dengue Outbreak Investigation and Management in 2006) issued by the National Commission for Health and Family Planning, formed a complete national technical framework for dengue control and prevention [13].",

All four dengue viruses are detected in China [11]. Upon review of the surveillance data collected by the monitoring program started in 2005 with a focus on southern provinces as-described above for the past years, a changing circulation pattern of DF has been observed in Guangdong, from non-endemicity (no virus sustained), to hypo-endemicity (one serotype present), and even hyper-endemicity (multiple serotypes present) of dengue infections [15]. In the last two decades, the biological behavior and vectorial capacity of Aedes mosquitoes have changed significantly in China, possibly due to urbanization and global climate changes [12]. Therefore, dengue illnesses have spread from southern coastal regions to the relatively northern and western areas of the country, and the interval between epidemics has become shorter since the 1990s compared to those that occurred before the 1990s, beginning with the first reported outbreak of DF in Guangdong in 1978 11., 12.. In 2013, a severe dengue outbreak of 1,245 cases happened in Yunnan Province, with a significant proportion of severe dengue cases; DENV-3 was identified to be the cause of the outbreak using real-time RT-PCR assays [16]. In the same year, the first dengue outbreak in central China was reported in Henan Province, a northern temperate province of China; 73 of 106 suspected DF cases of this outbreak were confirmed DENV-3 infections [17].",

According to the Guangdong Provincial CDC, the peak of the dengue outbreak was reached on October 1, and case numbers started to decline after October 11 [19]. Guangdong is located in a subtropical zone in China, and it has a high relative humidity, which may have created climatic and environmental conditions conducive to the proliferation of Aedes species. The DF epidemic area in Guangdong was mainly located in the old town which is under construction, and the poor sanitary infrastructure may contribute to this DF epidemic. A previous study from Guangdong showed that urbanization substantially increased the density, larval development rate, and adult survival time of Aedes species, which in turn potentially increases the vector capacity, and therefore, disease transmissibility [20].",

Dengue is an acute febrile illness, and only diagnostic testing can accurately determine the etiology of the syndrome and differentiate dengue from acute febrile illness caused by other pathogens. However, the current dengue surveillance programs in China and internationally are all syndrome based (that is, entail clinical case-definitions without laboratory confirmation) and almost all are passive [23]. With the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic algorithms and increased awareness of dengue expansion, robust, laboratory-based dengue surveillance is needed to document and monitor the regional and global dengue incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of dengue control interventions. More accurate epidemiological and surveillance data will support greater political prioritization for this currently \u2018\u2018neglected\u2019\u2019 disease. It would also allow improved decision making and rational allocation of financial, research, and other resources to the areas of greatest need [24].",
