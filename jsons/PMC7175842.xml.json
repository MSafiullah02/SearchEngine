In those instances, AL staff may need to be more involved than usual to facilitate social contact, and to actually assume responsibility for doing so, especially for residents with cognitive or physical impairment. In addition, staff may need to help families and others connect through other means, such as sending letters and photographs, and perhaps dropping off special meals at the AL door. There have been anecdotal reports of families connecting with their relative from outside the community, such as a husband who celebrated his 67th wedding anniversary with his wife from outside her window12; encouraging such engagement may be especially meaningful for family members as well.",

This editorial suggests special attention toward 7 areas toward that end. Key recommendations for health care and health policy planning around COVID-19 should therefore include these action steps:\u2022Ensure that AL residents are involved in discussion related to COVID-19, and that social distancing does not translate to social disengagement\u2022For residents with dementia, be mindful of the effects of social distancing and remain especially vigilant to medical signs of possible COVID-19\u2022Be proactive in instilling infection control practices in AL\u2022Consider the capacity of each AL community to promote social engagement and provide infection control, and their need for outside assistance\u2022Keep medical care providers informed about the status of their patients, and also of the capacity of the given AL community to provide care; make telehealth available, if possible\u2022Be mindful of whether the direct care workforce has the knowledge and skills to provide the care necessary in times of crisis; provide resources to enhance those skills if necessary\u2022Engage in continuous communication with family members, conveying the practices in place to prevent and combat COVID-19, and helping them remain meaningfully involved in resident oversight and well-being\n",
