These were washed with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and chopped finely and seeded in 25cm2 bottles with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL, USA). Cells were supplemented with DMEM and 10 per cent foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL, USA), 100 U penicillin/ml, and 0.1 mg streptomycin/ml at 37\u00b0C in an incubator supplemented with 5 per cent CO2 to initiate the cell line growth. The medium was prepared in the laboratory. The chemicals required were procured from Sigma, USA. The cells from other organs except embryo showed bacterial contamination and were discarded. Live cells from embryo were attached to the surface of wall of culture bottle in a few hours and dead cells were discarded next day and medium was changed. After 3rd day, trypsinization was done and cells were split into new culture bottles. The embryo cells of P. ceylonicus bat were screened for Nipah, Ebola and Marburg viruses (procured from NIV, Pune virus repository) by real-time RT-PCR and after establishment of cell line, therefore again tested for these pathogens141516. Mycoplasma infection was screened using Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC, USA) as per manufacturer's instruction. The developed cell line was named NIV-BtEPC.",

It showed cytopathic effects only with Chandipura (rhabdoviruses) and a novel adenovirus isolated from R. leschenaulti bats from India21 (Table). CPE was observed after eight hours of virus infection in the case of CHPV and progressed to cell rounding and detachments within 24 h for NIV-BtEPC cells. At 3rd post-infection day (PID) the total cell sheet was detached (Fig. 2A, B, C, D). Similarly, in the case of CHPV infected Vero E6 cells CPE started at 8th hour and totally detached at 24th hour as reported earlier22. CPE was characterized by cell rounding, foci formation and disintegration of cells and finally cell death. In case of NIV-BtEPC cells infected with Adenovirus, CPE was obvious after 2nd PID. Cells became rounded and clumped after 48 h and detached slowly but not 100 per cent. In Vero E6 cells adenovirus infected cells showed CPE, starting on the 3rd PID (Fig. 3A, B, C, D).",

R. leschenaultii, P. giganteus, C. sphinx and M. lyra bat species were placed in their respective family and genus. Cell line sequence was placed in family Vespertilionidae, genus Pipistrellus with other Pipistrellus bat sequences. This finding was consistent for both ND-1 and Cyt-b genes (Figs 4 and 5). Bat cell line nucleotide sequences showed highest homology with Pipistrellus species of bats with 86 to 87 per cent and 80 to 84 per cent for Cyt-b and ND-1 genes, respectively.

            "text": "Recent evidence of bat-borne viruses crossing the species barrier and causing severe diseases in humans and other animals, suggests the urgent need to establish cell lines from various bat species to facilitate virus isolation and understand virus-host interaction. Many bat-borne viruses like Ebola and Nipah cause fatal infections in human but reservoirs remain healthy. Therefore, understanding the bat immune responses and their role in maintaining the symbiotic presence of a large number of viruses, apparently without causing clinical disease is important23. Bats harbour many infectious agents ranging from risk group-2 to -41. Cell lines have been established from Egyptian fruit bat (R. aegyptiacus), which is fully permissive for a highly attenuated poxvirus, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)24. Myotis bat primary kidney cell line was reported to be susceptible for bat derived adenovirus isolation25. The Pteropus bat derived cell line was found susceptible for Hendra and Nipah viruses26. The present cell line NIV-BtEPC was selectively susceptible to rhabdo and adenoviruses. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine the susceptibility of this cell line to Nipah, SARS, CoV and Ebola viruses. At present, isolates of these highly pathogenic viruses are not available in India but a novel adenovirus was isolated from R. leschenaulti bat21 and Nipah viral RNA was detected from P. giganteus species of bats from India (NIV unpublished data). The multiplication of Chandipura virus (family: Rhabdoviridae) in NIV-BtEPC cell line also suggests that this species of bats perhaps may support multiplication of rabies virus, which is a member of the same family and has been isolated and detected in many bat species27. Highly divergent mitochondrial lineages provide strong evidence for cryptic species diversity in Indian bats. Close relatedness of cell line mitochondrial homology with Pipistrellus group of bats proved the identity of this cell line. Looking at the infectious and unknown disease spectrum of viruses, there is a need of developing new cell lines from the bats.",
