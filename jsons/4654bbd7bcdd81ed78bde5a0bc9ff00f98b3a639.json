Common allergy clinic procedures, including oral food challenges and subcutaneous immunotherapy, carry a risk of anaphylaxis, the treatment for which is epinephrine. Our goal was to develop a standardized process for the management and documentation of allergic reactions that occur in a tertiary care pediatric allergy clinic. Methods: This was a single institution quality improvement pilot study. A multidisciplinary team from the allergy department designed, implemented, and studied the use of a standardized form for the documentation and treatment of allergic reactions within the clinic. Results: A standardized form was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for the management of allergic reactions and included space for documentation. Both clinic providers and staff approved the form. One year after the introduction, we reached 100% adherence for the use of the form in visits during which a patient experienced a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Two patients required transfer to the emergency room; the quality improvement form was utilized in these cases to document treatment and assist with the hand-off to emergency room personnel before transfer. Conclusions: We successfully implemented a standardized form for the treatment and documentation of anaphylaxis within our allergy clinic. The next steps focus on further integrating this form into the electronic medical record, determining compliance with evidence-based management of anaphylaxis, and formally assessing the use of the form as a handoff tool in the event of patient transfer.",

It is a procedure during which a patient consumes food or medication in gradually increasing doses in a supervised medical office setting to determine if it provokes an allergic reaction. 3 SCIT or \"allergy shots,\" a common treatment for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and insect sting allergy, involves the subcutaneous injection of components of a patient's known environmental allergens. 4 Providers in the allergy clinic are prepared to treat allergic reactions triggered by OFC and SCIT. The pharmacologic treatment of anaphylaxis is the intramuscular injection of epinephrine. Providers may also administer oral antihistamines for adjunctive treatment or use in mild-moderate allergic reactions. 5, 6 Estimates of the incidence of systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis to SCIT, range from 1% to 4% of patients. 4 For OFCs, prior reports included a rate of anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine between 2% and 3.9% of all challenges (11%-39.2% of failed challenges). [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Occasionally, those patients who need a higher level of medical intervention for their reactions may require transfer to the emergency department (ED) or admission to the hospital for further treatment and observation. Others have shown that guideline-based treatment of anaphylaxis during oral Pediatric Quality and Safety food challenges is variable-with some studies reporting the use of intramuscular epinephrine in all cases of severe anaphylaxis; 7, 9 whereas, another study found that in 5 children with signs of anaphylaxis during OFC for which treatment data were available, none received intramuscular epinephrine. 10 In our Allergy and Immunology clinic at a tertiary care pediatric hospital, the number of OFC and SCIT visits continues to rise. Although rare, patients occasionally experience severe reactions requiring epinephrine and emergency transfer. Therefore, we wanted a system in place to standardize our approach to managing these reactions.",

Furthermore, this form would allow for documentation of objective signs along with interventions for individual patients at the time of their reaction, rather than relying on provider recall for documentation after the event, and thus, would deliver a better record for the next provider at the time of transfer.",

Thus, the overall rate of transfer to the ED decreased. As the information on total OFCs was only available by the calendar year, an exact comparison of the change in the rate of transfer for the study period alone is not available. However, comparing overall transfer rates per year (rather than study period), we found that in the calendar year 2017, there were 360 OFCs and 3 ED transfers (0.83% per year) while for the calendar year 2018, there were 448 OFCs and 1 ED transfer (0.22% rate).",

At our tertiary care allergy/immunology clinic, there are now over 500 patient visits for an OFC and over 400 SCIT patient visits yearly. A prior retrospective review from our center found an incidence of allergic reaction Run chart for implementation of the anaphylaxis treatment plan. The frequency per month that the EMR of a patient who received epinephrine included a copy of the completed anaphylaxis treatment plan (blue diamonds) increased quickly after implementation. Note that before this QI project (before November 2017), our clinic did not have a standardized form for the treatment of anaphylaxis. After developing the form with the input of medical providers and clinic staff, the standardized treatment plan was rolled-out in the clinic in November 2017. Redline represents the process stage median, and the green line indicates the goal (70%). requiring epinephrine of 3.6% of OFC visits and 0.4% of SCIT visits. 16 The demand for these visits continues to rise, and the number of transfers has the potential to increase. Before this project, we observed that in 5 years (January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016), there were 871 in-office challenges, during which 2 patients required an emergency transfer from the allergy clinic for anaphylaxis (0.23%). In the following 6 months, from January to June of 2017, 2 out of 173 OFC patients (1.2%) were transferred to the ED. While all patients improved, and there were no adverse outcomes, there was no standardized process for the documentation surrounding the management of these patients. Additionally, documentation in the EMR of reactions and medication administration often occurs after the encounter and, thus, might not be available to the ED at the time of transfer. This increase in ED transfers in the first half of 2017 identified a need for standardization and documentation that we addressed through QI methodology.",

            "text": "Guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis recommend the use of intramuscular epinephrine. 1 Despite the presence of these guidelines, other studies of allergic reactions during OFC have shown inconsistent adherence to these guidelines. 10 While providers in our clinic are aware of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis, as the number of clinic procedures with the potential for an allergic reaction increased, we wanted to ensure standardization among providers of the protocol for the treatment of these reactions. Although there is limited allergy-specific data available for the best way to promote standardized treatment for anaphylaxis, shared experiences from other specialties in the hospital and clinic settings can be useful for encouraging adherence to guideline-based treatment. For example, a prior study demonstrated developing standardized bundles for treatment recommendations improves adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in admitted patients, with adherence to the bundle increasing by 43.8%. 13 Additionally, in our intervention, we wanted to provide a physical form to accurately document the management of allergic reactions in real-time since clinic visit notes are often completed after the conclusion of the visit (and, thus, not available to the providers in the ED). While we did not examine provider notes, it is possible that just having the anaphylaxis form would improve the EMR documentation of the clinic visit. In fact, in a study of patients with shoulder dystocia, it was noted that a standardized form used in the delivery room improved the completeness of provider notes. 12 In our study, we achieved 100% adherence to our documentation form shortly after introducing the form in the clinic. We attribute this success to the role the nursing staff played in form development and the placement of the forms in exam rooms. We also consider it a strength of our project that clinic providers used this form despite the relative infrequent (23 patients/year) episodes of severe allergic reactions requiring epinephrine use in the clinic. Only 1 patient who received epinephrine for a severe allergic reaction did not have the form completed. This patient was the first patient to receive epinephrine after implementation of the form, so the provider unfamiliarity with the new form may have contributed to a lack of use. It is also possible that the nurse or provider completed the form and then discarded it rather than scanning it into the patient's EMR at the end of the visit. Additionally, this patient experienced a reaction after SCIT, whereas all patients who experienced anaphylaxis during an OFC had the form completed.",

Because of the low incidence, we reviewed records of patients who experienced anaphylaxis retrospectively 1 year following the intervention rather than in real-time. We attempted to mitigate the possibility of missed cases by using objective measures such as pharmacy charges for epinephrine use when identifying eligible patients. Epinephrine use would identify all potential patients transferred to the ED for an allergic reaction from our clinic (ie, no patients in the past 5 years have been transferred from the allergy clinic to the ED for a severe allergic reaction without having first received at least 1 dose of epinephrine). We confirmed in our review of the completed forms that all doses of medication (as ordered in the EMR during the visit) matched the hand-written form. However, the timing of symptom onset when compared with the initial time of documentation on the form is less easily identifiable. For instance, the first entry in some cases was with the first medication administered, and it is unclear whether there were earlier, undocumented symptoms present before the need for medical management. This observation represents an area for improvement: future iterations can study whether symptoms of anaphylaxis occurred before medication administration and be used to promote learning among providers and staff for early recognition of anaphylaxis. Additionally, for those patients transferred to the ED, we expected that a copy of the form would accompany the patient to the ED and help with the transition of care to the next provider; however, the utility of this form as a handoff tool is unclear based on documentation in the patient's record. Finally, although we were primarily interested in the implementation of this standard form during severe allergic reactions, it is unclear how frequently or effectively this form is being used when patients experience milder allergic reactions in the clinic that do not require epinephrine.",

We are also actively working with providers to ensure episodes of anaphylaxis are documented adequately in the progress note and labeled as a \"diagnosis\" at that visit so that we can better track and monitor these episodes in the clinic. Additionally, we hope to assess whether the presence of an available protocol encourages evidence-based treatment for anaphylaxis in the clinic among providers.

Of the forms completed during the study period, all included the name and time of medication administration, 1 or more of the patient's symptoms, and at least 1 set of vital signs. The timing of the first entry on the form, however, was variable with some entries beginning at the first sign of clinical reaction (see Supplemental Digital Content 2B at http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A160). For others, the entry began at the time of medication (such as epinephrine) administration (see Supplemental Digital Content 2A at http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A160). This observation may indicate a lack of entry of early clinical signs and symptoms before the onset of anaphylaxis requiring treatment. Additionally, only 74% (17/23) of the forms included documentation of the patient's disposition, time of clinic departure, and provider signature. It took a median of 20 days (range 5-43) from the time of the original patient visit to the scan of the completed form into the EMR.",
