            "text": "Bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections result in millions of deaths worldwide and are currently the leading cause of death from infection. Acute inflammation is an essential element of host defense against infection, but can be damaging to the host when left unchecked. Effective host defense requires multiple lipid mediators, which collectively have proinflammatory and/ or proresolving effects on the lung. During pulmonary infections, phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol can be chemically and enzymatically oxidized, as well as truncated and modified, producing complex mixtures of bioactive lipids. We review recent evidence that phospholipids and cholesterol and their derivatives regulate pulmonary innate and adaptive immunity during infection. We first highlight data that oxidized phospholipids generated in the lung during infection stimulate pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and scavenger receptors, thereby amplifying the pulmonary inflammatory response. Next, we discuss evidence that oxidation of endogenous pools of cholesterol during pulmonary infections produces oxysterols that also modify the function of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Last, we conclude with data that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, both in the form of phospholipid acyl chains and through enzymatic processing into endogenous proresolving lipid mediators, aid in the resolution of lung inflammation through distinct mechanisms. Unraveling the complex mechanisms of induction and function of distinct classes of bioactive lipids, both native and modified, may hold promise for developing new therapeutic strategies for improving pulmonary outcomes in response to infection.

            "text": "Respiratory infections, both bacterial and viral, contribute to more than 3 million deaths worldwide annually [1, 2] . Currently, pneumonia is the leading cause of death by infection [3] . Therapeutics available to treat respiratory infections are limited in scope and can have multiple adverse side effects and low efficacy [4] [5] [6] . Respiratory infections initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung. Although these immune responses are critical for clearing respiratory pathogens, they must be tightly regulated to effectively kill invading microorganisms while minimizing bystander tissue injury and maintaining pulmonary function. In the present review, we discuss evidence that 2 classes of lipid mediators-oxPLs and oxysterols-are generated during infection and then mediate the pulmonary immune response. We also explain how pools of exogenous lipids (n-3 PUFAs) incorporated into host phospholipids can mitigate and improve the immunopathology associated with bacterial and viral pneumonia. Improved insight into these lipid mediators may ultimately provide novel therapeutic targets for the clinical management of pulmonary infection.",

The first line of defense that the lungs have against invading pathogens is the resident cells of the lung, both structural (i.e., respiratory epithelial cells) and hematopoietic (i.e., AMs) [8] . These cells, and the communications between them, are pivotal in orchestrating the pulmonary immune response to microorganisms. The epithelial cells of the respiratory tract create barriers mediated by their production of both secretory mediators and intercellular junctional proteins [9] . The secretory products of the upper and lower airways include mucin and pulmonary surfactant. During infection, mucin production is upregulated, in part through metaplasia of goblet cells, and serves to prevent microbes from binding to and infecting epithelial cells [10, 11] . Pulmonary surfactant, a complex mixture of ;90% lipid and 10% protein, serves both to decrease surface tension in the alveolus and to protect the respiratory tract from pathogens [12] . The hydrophobic SP-A and SP-D, are collectins, a protein family that recognizes a wide range of PAMPs, including those found on respiratory viruses, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and associated toxins [13] [14] [15] . Once the SPs bind to pathogens, they promote opsonization and subsequent killing of the pathogens by phagocytic cells in the respiratory tract, such as AMs.",

Once PRRs on respiratory epithelial cells are stimulated by PAMPs and DAMPs, cytokine production is initiated by downstream signaling adapters, such as MyD88 and TRIF, that in turn activate key transcription factors, such as NF-kB and interferon regulatory factor-3 [9, 16] . The release of cytokines and chemokines recruits innate and adaptive immune cells to the lung from the periphery [9, 16] . During pulmonary infections, MyD88-dependent downstream signaling leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6, that act in concert with chemoattractants, such as CXCL1 and -2, to recruit PMNs to the lungs that kill pathogens [9, 16, 18] . The TRIF-mediated pathway in the respiratory epithelium induces type I IFN production (i.e., IFN-a and -b) [19] . Type I IFN signaling is critical to host defense, as revealed by mice lacking the receptor to type I IFN that succumb to infection by influenza virus [20] . Activation of type I IFNs produces several specific antiviral factors, such as IFN-induced GTP-binding protein MX dynamin-like GTPase 1, as well as various cellular responses that are important in T cell recruitment and polarization [20, 21] .",

Macrophages and DCs are professional APCs that, in response to infection and insult, infiltrate tissues and initiate an inflammatory response. Macrophages are not only key players in the initiation of inflammation, but also orchestrate its resolution [25] . Macrophages can be broadly categorized into 2 subsets [39] . Classically activated or M1 macrophages are induced by the bacterial cell wall component LPS or a combination of the Th1 cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a [39] . Alternatively activated or M2 macrophages are induced by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and -13 [5] . M1 macrophages are characterized by the production of ROS, reactive nitrogen intermediates, IL-1, IL-12, and TNF-a [39, 40] . In addition, M1 macrophages drive Th1 responses, have roles in antitumor immunity, and kill intracellular foreign pathogens [41] . M2 macrophages express arginase-1, scavenger and mannose receptors, and IL-10. This macrophage subset regulates wound healing, restores tissue homeostasis, and also antagonizes proinflammatory M1 macrophage responses. Recent studies have shown that M1 phenotype is not static and that these macrophages can acquire anti-inflammatory features with an M2 wound-healing phenotype depending on the cytokine milieu to which they are exposed [42] . There is also evidence for subpopulations of M2 macrophages (M2a, M2b, and M2c) that are also characterized by differential expression of surface receptors and transcription factor expression as well as functional differences [43] .",

The role of B cells during infection has been mostly studied in conjunction with diverse antibody production (IgG, IgA, and IgM). However, B cells are also important sources of cytokines and Ag presentation during respiratory infections [59] . After infection with respiratory viruses such as influenza, B cells are primed with viral Ag in the secondary lymphoid organs. After priming, B cells proliferate into short-and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells that either travel back to the lung and form induced bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue or stay in the lymph nodes [60] . This provides not only a source of neutralizing antibody for the primary infection but also source of protection against reinfection.",

As discussed above, surfactant contains approximately 80-90% PLs, with fatty acid chains that can be oxidized during different challenges in the lung [61, 62] . In addition, PLs are major constituents of cellular membranes and can be released during cell death and injury [63] . Oxidation of these PLs in the lung can occur during normal physiologic and metabolic processes but also in the setting of the increased oxidative stress of infection and inflammation [64] . Upon oxidation, PLs can be oxidized into a variety of species, including 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6) epoxyisoprostane E2-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (PEIPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC), and smaller chemical fragments [65] . OxPLs are generated through either enzymatic or nonenzymatic reactions induced by ROS production, air pollution, cigarette smoke, and UV radiation [65] [66] [67] [68] . OxPLs are thought to serve as DAMPs, insofar as they can stimulate multiple innate immune receptors, leading to prolonged inflammation and downstream signaling [64] . Once generated, oxPLs can be cleared by multiple biologic mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation by epoxide hydrolases and aldehyde dehydrogenases, formation of adducts, or uptake through SRs or through neutralization by natural antibodies, C-reactive protein, and complement factor H [69] [70] [71] [72] . The immune effects of oxPLs during infectious diseases are inevitably dictated by the balance among activation, degradation, and scavenging.",

It has been shown that oxPLs are generated in the lung during several pulmonary infections, including influenza [73, 74] and avian influenza (H5N1), SARS coronavirus, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and monkey pox. It is unclear what the primary source of increased oxPLs is during pulmonary infections; however, one could speculate that an increase in cellular apoptosis, an increase in ROS by phagocytic cells, and changes in surfactant from pulmonary inflammation are major contributors. In a pivotal paper Imai et al. [75] noted that oxPL levels are increased during H5N1 infection and that blocking oxPLs decreases the pulmonary inflammation associated with infection. They found oxPLmediated inflammation during infection to be a result of TLR4 activation of the TRIF pathway, indicating that oxPLs can serve as DAMPs that amplify the innate immune response during infection (Fig. 1) .",

All of these receptors are expressed on resident or infiltrating cells of the lung. Therefore, excess production of oxPLs can alter multiple cellular functions that are important in the pulmonary immune response during respiratory infections.

In addition, TLR2-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages have decreased cytokine production after oxPAPC stimulation [77] . However, oxPLs have also been reported to have dampening effects on PAMP-induced cytokine production. OxPAPC inhibits macrophage production of TNF-a after stimulation with LPS, 59-C-phosphate-G-39DNA, and Pam3CSK4 [77] [78] [79] . In the context of LPS signaling, oxPAPC has been reported to inhibit LPS binding to the TLR4 accessory proteins CD14 [77] and myeloid differentiation factor 2 [80] . In the context of influenza infection, oxPL-induced inflammation is mediated by TLR4 and TRIF, driving an increase in IL-6 production by AMs ( [75] , Fig. 1 ). However, in the context of an innate immune challenge in a model of LPS-induced pneumonitis wherein rats were pretreated intravenously with oxPLs, reductions in airspace PMNs, microvascular injury, and proinflammatory cytokines were noted [81] . The differences in pulmonary responses noted in these 2 studies could be the result of differences in the timing and route of oxPL delivery or in the technical features of the models tested.

It is intriguing to consider that oxPL-dependent defects in phagocytosis and ROS generation may lead to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.",

DCs treated with oxPAPC display reduced upregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, MHCII, and CCR7 induced by LPS and the TLR3 PAMP poly(I:C) [87] , suggesting probable downstream effects on Th cell programming. OxPAPC treatment of DCs also resulted in reduced IL-12 production and altered na\u00efve T cell polarization [88] . Oxidized LDL has also been shown to inhibit TLR induction of proinflammatory cytokines in CD8a neg DCs, thus skewing T cells away from a Th1 phenotype [89] . In addition, flipping of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer plasma membrane leaflet during apoptosis of infected cells has been shown to suppress adaptive immune responses such as dendritic cell function and T cell activation [2, 3, 5, 6] . Although most of the effects of oxPLs have been documented in in vitro models, this area of oxPL-mediated immunity could ultimately prove highly relevant to the in vivo efficacy of vaccines designed to combat pulmonary pathogens.",

Most of the cholesterol in the lung derives from uptake of circulating plasma lipoproteins [91] , rendering the lung and its extracellular surfactant reservoir sensitive to diet and systemic metabolic states [92] . Cholesterol overload in the lung and, in particular, in pulmonary macrophages, is avoided through reverse cholesterol transport from tissue to plasma which, as in other tissues, involves interactions between cellular lipid efflux transporters (e.g., ATP binding cassette transporter G1 [93] ) and plasma lipid acceptors (e.g., HDL). Intriguingly, increased numbers of lipid-laden macrophage foam cells have been described in a wide range of chronic inflammatory lung diseases [94] , suggesting that phagocyte cholesterol dysregulation may be a common, and potentially, a causal event in lung disorders. As a determinant of cell signaling and a molecular target of both chemical and enzymatic oxidation, cholesterol serves as a pivotal regulator of inflammation and host defense. The lungspecific implications of this emerging role for cholesterol in inflammation and immunity, however, have only recently begun to be defined [95] .",

Raft cholesterol is also critical to the viral life cycle in host cells, as several viruses, including influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV are thought to bud from lipid raft microdomains (Fig. 1) [98] . Raft cholesterol also regulates the invasion of multiple bacterial pathogens into host cells.

Reports differ on whether host cell protection derives from shutdown of new cholesterol synthesis [103] or from depletion of cellular isoprenoids [102] , an alternate lipid product of the mevalonic acid synthesis pathway. Depletion of newly synthesized cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum may potentiate activation of, and IFN induction by, the antiviral receptor stimulator of IFN genes, potentiating an antiviral feedforward loop (Fig. 1) [103] . Both statin treatment of wild-type mice [102] and genetargeting of the mevalonic acid synthesis pathway in mutant mice [103] enhanced host defense against virus in vivo, including lung infections.

Analogous to the case for the double bonds of unsaturated acyl chains in surfactant PLs, direct oxidation of the carbon 5-6 double bond of the B ring of cholesterol by ROS is likely a common event for pulmonary surfactant cholesterol in the setting of inhaled oxidants such as ozone [105] . Ring oxidation yields cytotoxic oxysterols, such as b-epoxide [105] , the clearance of which is regulated by SRs [106] . On the other hand, several enzymes are known to add hydroxyl groups to the side chain carbons of cholesterol (i.e., carbons 20-27), yielding side chain oxysterols (e.g., 25HC) that have pleiotropic bioactivity [107] . Several such oxysterolsynthetic enzymes appear to have particular relevance to phagocyte biology in the lung. For example, CYP27A1 is highly expressed in AMs of the human lung, and its product, cholestenoic acid, is thought to play a key role in cholesterol homeostasis in the human lung [108] . Ch25h, an enzyme that produces 25HC from cholesterol, is also most highly expressed in the lung in mice [107] , likely because of its very high expression in AMs (www.immgen.org).",

Proinflammatory actions include potentiation of activator protein-1 binding to the promoter of proinflammatory genes [109] and chemoattraction of leukocytes via CXCR2 [110] , whereas potential anti-inflammatory actions include suppression of the inflammasome [111] , repression of NF-kB via activation of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor [112] , and suppression of B cell proliferation and IgA class switching [113] . A recent landmark discovery was the recognition that Ch25h is an IFN-stimulated gene that is robustly induced by both TLR agonists and virus [113] [114] [115] and that its product 25HC is a potent antiviral molecule that suppresses virus through inhibiting host cell fusion [114] or postfusion events [115] . As 25HC is reportedly increased in the sputum of patients with COPD [116] and also induced in vivo in the plasma of humans after systemic LPS challenge [117] , its complex effects in host defense and inflammation are likely highly relevant to human disease and clearly warrant further study.",

Because of deficient 7a,25-OHC gradients in the spleen or responsiveness to them, both Ch25h-null and Ebi2-null mice fail to position splenic B cells in the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after immune challenge [118, 119] . 7a,25-OHC also plays a key role in Ebi2-dependent positioning of CD4 + DCs to marginal zone bridging channels in the spleen, facilitating capture, presentation, and antibody responses to bloodborne Ags [120, 121] . Several other oxysterols including 7b,27dihydroxycholesterol have also been reported to be agonists for ROR-gt, the hallmark transcription factor for Th17 differentiation; thus, mice deficient in CYP27A1, an enzyme that contributes to synthesis of these RORgt-active oxysterols, have Th17 cell deficiency comparable to that of RORgt-knockout mice [122] .",

A recent review elegantly highlights studies on how SPMs aid in the resolution of pulmonary inflammation [126] . Therefore, we are focusing in this review on key studies that demonstrate a role for EPA and DHA as dietary or pharmacologic agents in influencing lung inflammation and pulmonary outcomes in infection. We first review preclinical and clinical studies in which EPA and DHA were used to elucidate their role in lung homeostasis. We then discuss potential molecular mechanisms of EPA and DHA in the context of infection and inflammation.",

The researchers also measured lung permeability and found no effects of n-3 PUFAs on this endpoint. In another study, n-3 PUFAs reduced the frequency of PMNs and lowered IL-6 levels in male cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr)-null mice in response to P. aeruginosa infection [128] . The same study also reported some gender differences by demonstrating that infected female Cftr-null mice had improved mortality, lung permeability, and IL-6 levels [128] . With S. pneumoniae infection in mice, n-3 PUFAs improved both inflammatory markers in lung homogenates and bacterial loads in the lungs [129] [130] [131] .

            "text": "Although some of the aforementioned studies demonstrated that exogenous n-3 PUFA administration has beneficial effects through pleiotropic mechanisms (discussed below), there are some studies that showed negative consequences of select n-3 PUFAs on pulmonary outcomes. For instance, DHA administration to mice in an aerosol ovalbumin model of asthma led to increased levels of eosinophils and IL-6 in BAL fluid, accompanied by high airway resistance [136] . The effects were specific for DHA, given that EPA did not show the same negative effects. In another study, mice consuming high levels of fish oil enriched in n-3 PUFAs had lower lung pathology scores, increased lung viral titers, and decreased survival of influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 virus infection [137] . The implications of these findings are not clear, given that a more recent study has shown that the SPM 17-HDHA synthesized from DHA improves mouse survival upon live influenza infection by enhancing antibody production by CD138 + plasma cells [138] . Similarly, the SPM protectin D1 synthesized from DHA inhibited lung viral replication with H5N1 infection [139] . Perhaps there is an optimal amount of tissue n-3 PUFA concentration that is necessary for improving pulmonary outcomes and excess levels of n-3 PUFAs or perhaps even deficiencies lead to deleterious effects. Moreover, it is possible that excessive oxidation of n-3 PUFA acyl chains of PLs render cellular damage that contributes to excessive inflammation.",

At the cellular level, innate responses such as DC activation are generally suppressed by n-3 PUFAs. A series of studies in cell culture and mouse models have demonstrated that EPA and DHA diminish LPS-induced upregulation of surface molecules such as CD80, CD86, and MHCII. As a consequence, DC cytokine secretion and activation of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells is suppressed by n-3 PUFAs [147] [148] [149] . Macrophage activation, in the context of obesity, has also been shown to be suppressed by DHA [150] . Less is known about PMN responses, with a recent study suggesting that high levels of n-3 PUFAs promote PMN activation [151] . Thus, the steady-state frequency and function of innate cells involved in pulmonary responses may be influenced by n-3 PUFAs.

In human bronchial epithelial cells, EPA lowered NADPH oxidase activity and ROS [166] . n-3 PUFAs can also directly target the expression of surface molecules, which is most likely driven by effects at the level of gene expression. For example, docosapentaenoic acid (22:5, n-3), the elongation production of EPA, decreases matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and VEGF expression levels in lung tissue homogenates in experimental pulmonary rat hypertension [167] . These effects were driven by a decrease in p38 MAPK activation and NF-kB translocation.",

The effects of n-3 PUFAs are likely to vary between individuals because of differences in genetic variations of key enzymes involved in PUFA biosynthesis and metabolism [168] . For instance, genetic variants in the fatty acid desaturase cluster (a key enzymatic step in PUFA metabolism) may be responsible for differences in n-3 PUFA levels between individuals of African and European descent [169] . Therefore, extensive studies on PUFA-gene interactions are needed in the context of lung pathology, to effectively translate n-3 PUFAs to clinical trials.",

            "text": "A final mechanism of high relevance is the generation of SPMs from n-3 PUFAs. As discussed earlier, SPMs are potent molecules that aid in the resolution of inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated the impact of SPMs in pulmonary inflammation. For instance, resolvin D1, synthesized from DHA, lowers lung inflammation in a model of cigarette smoking [170] . However, it remains unclear whether pharmacologic intake of EPA or DHA, respectively, leads to increased levels of E-and D-series SPMs in vivo. Some studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs given to humans can lead to increased levels of SPMs, although other studies have questioned this assumption [171, 172] . Given this discrepancy, the degree to which n-3 PUFAs affect inflammation and immunity in vivo through SPM generation vs. through SPMindependent mechanisms remains unclear. Taken together, the link between intake of n-3 PUFAs and SPMs requires more attention, especially in the context of lung tissues.",

PL homeostasis, cholesterol homeostasis, and n-3 PUFA metabolism are central examples of how lipids and their dynamic interaction with environmental factors in the lung influence the myriad of responses in innate and adaptive immunity. Connecting the mechanisms by which these lipid classes crosstalk to influence the targeting of receptors and downstream signaling in the lung will be centrally important in the development of new therapeutics for pulmonary disease. With the incidence of lung diseases on the rise, it is essential to understand how these mediators, singly and in combination, modify the pulmonary immune response and whether there are therapeutic opportunities for manipulating the levels of bioactive lipids in the lung during respiratory infection.

Selected roles for cholesterol, oxysterols, and oxPLs in the macrophage innate immune response are depicted. IFN-b induced by virus or LPS feeds back through autocrine/paracrine signaling, upregulating Ch25h and also inhibiting the cholesterol (CHOL) synthesis pathway. 25HC, the product of Ch25h, exerts several effects, inhibiting viral fusion and proliferation, inhibiting inflammasome-dependent IL-1b production, but also augmenting induction of select proinflammatory genes, such as IL-6. IFN-b-dependent inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis augments antiviral defense by enhancing stimulator of Ifn genes-dependent IFN-b induction and also possibly by depleting lipid rafts, through which several viruses bud from host cells. OxPL induced in the inflamed lung and not cleared by scavenger receptors such as macrophage receptor with collagenous structure may induce TLR4-dependent proinflammatory cytokines via the adaptor protein TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-b (Trif), aggravating lung injury.
