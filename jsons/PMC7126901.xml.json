The human immune system recognizes 4 antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) (i.e., DENV1-4) (Curtis et al., 2008, Curtis et al., 2009). Symptoms can range from mild fever, headaches, myalgia, and rashes (Dineva et al., 2007, Ding et al., 2010) to severe disease characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhage. Severe dengue can be fatal, especially without intensive medical care. The virus is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and is endemic in most tropical and subtropical areas where these vectors are found. An estimated 390 million DENV infections are believed to occur each year, resulting in 96 million symptomatic cases (Bhatt et al., 2013). Neither vaccines nor antiviral treatments are available to reduce DENV-associated morbidity or mortality. The only available treatment option is supportive bed rest, fluids, and symptomatic relief with analgesics.",

Traditional laboratory techniques for dengue diagnosis include viral isolation followed by indirect immunofluorescence assay or serological assays such as plaque reduction neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition, and IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Francois et al., 2011, Fredricks and Relman, 1998, George and Lum, 1997). Some of these techniques can take days or weeks to complete. Furthermore, serological methods require convalescent samples demonstrating an increase in antibody titer from pre-exposure samples in order to make a definitive diagnosis, making it impossible to confirm a diagnosis in the acute stage, limiting the value of serological assays for informing patient management.",

This can be an advantage because it facilitates earlier detection of dengue (within 1\u20137 days post onset of symptoms), before an immune response has been mounted and serology-based diagnostics can detect IgM or IgG levels (typically detectable 5\u201314 days post onset of symptoms). However, PCR equipment is expensive, requires trained personnel, and is best suited to diagnostic reference laboratories. Other nucleic acid detection strategies based on isothermal amplification such as nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification (NASBA) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) have been developed to address these challenges and move molecular assays closer to point-of-care use (Gubler, 1998, Hayasaka et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Here, we have explored a DENV diagnostic solution using the RT-LAMP technology. The technology was originally developed by Eiken Chemical Company (Notomi et al., 2000) and is based on the principle of strand displacement. Briefly, Bst polymerase has both polymerase and strand displacement activity and can be used to amplify nucleic acids using a series of primers that initiate a specific stem loop structure following binding to a target sequence (Henchal et al., 1983, Hong et al., 2004). This structure allows the enzyme to polymerize nucleic acids continuously at permissive temperatures beyond 57\u201365 \u00b0C. A variety of methods can be used to visualize the amplified DNA product or the magnesium pyrophosphate by-product. The DNA amplicon can be labeled with an intercalating agent such as SYBR Green and visualized using the naked eye or under UV light. Alternatively, the magnesium pyrophosphate causes turbidity, which can be visualized by the naked eye or using a turbidimeter (Mori et al., 2001). Another benefit of this assay is that it does not require expensive instrumentation and takes less than an hour to perform, making LAMP and RT-LAMP suitable for diagnostic applications in low-resource settings. The technology has been adapted to detect a variety of microorganisms ranging from bacteria such as Mycobacterium (Iwamoto et al., 2003); parasites such as Plasmodium (Sattabongkot et al., 2014); and viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (Kaneko et al., 2007, Kao et al., 2005), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004), and hepatitis B virus (Kwallah et al., 2013, Hong et al., 2004). RT-LAMP has also been evaluated for diagnosing other members of the Flaviviridae family, including yellow fever virus (Kwallah et al., 2013), Japanese encephalitis virus (Li et al., 2011, McAvin et al., 2005), West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (Hayasaka et al., 2013).",

Some groups have developed pan-serotype DENV RT-LAMP assays (Teoh et al., 2013), and others have expanded this concept to a pan-flaviviral assay that detects DENV1-4, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus in a single reaction (Li et al., 2011). We report a pan-serotype DENV RT-LAMP assay that has been optimized and evaluated with an extensive panel of clinical samples obtained from febrile patients in South America. We have additionally explored a method of reducing assay variability in a DENV quantitative RT-LAMP (qRT-LAMP) that uses a quencher to reduce false positives. Finally, we have also examined methods for streamlining sample preparation and evaluated visualization of the qRT-LAMP product using lateral flow immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) and a handheld fluorescence reader. Together, this represents a complete assay, from sample to result, which can be used to identify DENV with high accuracy in low-resource settings.",

Among these, 1 set of primers was down-selected based on faster time to positivity in a pilot experiment (data not shown). Table 1\nsummarizes the primers used. The primers target a 3\u2032 untranslated region of DENV that is highly conserved between all 4 serotypes and multiple strains. Unlike traditional LAMP assays, which require 4\u20136 primers, this pan-dengue RT-LAMP uses 11 primers, including 3 FIP, 3 BIP, and 3 B3 degenerate primers. Using a positive control template, the RT-LAMP reaction was tested within a range of temperatures (57\u201365 \u00b0C, Fig. 1A) using a simple water bath as the heat source. Nucleic acid amplification took place at all the temperatures tested, and subsequent experiments were performed at 63 \u00b0C. Next, various assay characteristics were systematically optimized, including primer, enzyme, and betaine concentrations, in order to achieve the fastest time to result (data not shown). Under optimized conditions, 106 copies/reaction of DENV RNA was detectable in approximately 30 minutes when using gel electrophoresis or UV as a readout (Fig. 1B). The assay was designed to be reactive to all 4 serotypes of DENV, and this was confirmed using tissue culture\u2013derived positive strains (Fig. 1C). Using a serial dilution of DENV2, we determined a limit of detection of 103 copies/reaction where samples were detected reliably a majority (>50%) of the time, comparable to qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B illustrates how time to positivity is affected by the number of copies of DENV template present in the reaction. Based on these results, we selected a reaction time of 60 minutes to enable reliable detection of >103 copies/reaction for all 4 DENV serotypes while minimizing nonspecific amplification. We also saw positive RT-LAMP reactions using DENV-positive samples that had been heat treated for 10 minutes at 100 \u00b0C. Boiling samples can eliminate the need for formal RNA extraction steps as has been previously reported with DNA-based pathogen targets (Parida et al., 2005, Parida et al., 2006).",

Precautionary measures were implemented to reduce risk of contamination from template, and these substantially reduced initial false-positive results. However, another kind of nonspecific amplification was also infrequently observed, which was distinguishable from contamination-derived false-positive results based on a different banding pattern on agarose gels (Fig. 5\n). It has been hypothesized that this is due to non\u2013template-driven self-priming. Other groups were able to limit this phenomenon by attaching a fluorescent label to their loop primer, followed by the addition of a probe with a fluorescence quencher (Curtis et al., 2009). As the increased number of primers in our pan-serotype assay may facilitate nonspecific amplification, we examined whether sequence-specific detection was a feasible solution. At the end of the RT-LAMP reaction, any unbound FAM-loop probe was quenched by BHQ-labeled probe (which consists of the reverse complement sequence of the FAM-loop probe with a BHQ modification.) We optimized this formulation and found no difference in the permissible temperature range, time to positivity, or number of serotypes detected when including a fluorescently labeled loop primer (Fig. 5A\u2013C). In addition, this formulation was able to reduce the nonspecific amplification (Fig. 5D).",

However, various methods to visualize RT-LAMP results including real-time PCR thermocyclers, agarose gel electrophoresis, turbidity measurements, and UV illumination are not practical in resource-limited settings. We thus explored the feasibility of determining RT-LAMP positivity via an inexpensive lateral flow ICT. We found 100% correlation between our agarose gel and ICT results when using 24 DENV1-, DENV2-, or DENV3-positive specimens. One specimen that was false negative when visualized via agarose gel electrophoresis was also negative via ICT (Fig. 4), suggesting that ICT has sensitivity comparable to other methods. Our data demonstrate that RT-LAMP results can be reliably determined without the aid of expensive or bulky equipment. We further evaluated the ability of our RT-LAMP assay to be visualized using a battery-operated handheld fluorescent reader and observed the kinetics of quenching over time. True-positive samples remain above a fluorescent threshold of 30 units following 1 hour of quenching.",

            "text": "Diagnosing dengue accurately during acute infection is critical for informing patient management decisions. Lateral flow ICTs targeting the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen have had some success in enabling early diagnosis at the point of need; however, nucleic acid tests (NATs) may detect DENV RNA earlier than NS1 antigen, and NATs can be more sensitive and specific. The primary disadvantage with PCR-based NATs involves the need for thermocyclers, which are often bulky and too expensive to be used in resource-limited settings. Commercially available PCR kits cost $50\u2013100/test and are generally unsuitable for high-throughput usage in developing economies (Rico-Hesse, 2003, Sattabongkot et al., 2014). In addition, thermocyclers can cost $20,000\u2013$120,000, which may be prohibitive in many dengue-endemic countries (Dineva et al., 2007). Training personnel to operate the instrument and interpret results also requires resources typically only found in a reference laboratory. PCR is also subject to inhibition by substances such as heme compounds, heparin, and EDTA often present in a clinical samples and blood collection tubes, leading to false-negative results (Shu and Huang, 2004, Tanner et al., 2012); removing PCR inhibitors can lead to increased overhead costs and turnaround time to results. Conversely, PCR is also often subject to reporting false positives from the presence of contaminating nucleic acids (Fredricks and Relman, 1998), necessitating the use of template-free \u201cclean rooms\u201d for preparing a master mix, which is impractical in the field.",

We demonstrate that the reaction can proceed continuously within a wide temperature range 57\u201365 \u00b0C, making it suitable for a water bath or electricity-free heater (LaBarre et al., 2011). In addition, we have explored various methods of visualizing the assay results. Electrophoresis gel confirmation of reaction products may be performed in a reference laboratory, but in the field, the reaction can be visualized in real time by measuring an increase in turbidity from magnesium pyrophosphate by-products (Mori et al., 2001). We propose a method involving the measurement of color change by the incorporation of SYBR Green adapted from a previous report, which was easier to read with the naked eye (Parida et al., 2005). We also explored visualization using lateral flow ICTs and demonstrated 100% concordance between RT-LAMP visualized on a gel versus those visualized using ICTs. This format is likely to be easier to read in resource-limited settings where a UV light source is not available. Finally, we explored the feasibility of using a handheld UV fluorescence reader, which when coupled with a quencher, can provide higher specificity detection of DENV. The handheld UV reader that we used was approximately $500, and such readers could improve accuracy of readout as well as provide some level of quantitation to RT-LAMP results. LAMP has several other advantages over traditional PCR, including less sensitivity to inhibitors such as ethanol, isopropanol, EDTA, and sodium acetate (Teoh et al., 2013, Toriniwa and Komiya, 2006). The use of loop-specific primers can reduce assay times to provide faster sample to result than PCR, and other groups have reported higher sensitivity (Nagamine et al., 2002). LAMP also does not require the template to be denatured (Nagamine et al., 2001), and contrasted with NASBA (a similar isothermal NAT), LAMP does not require a separate nucleic acid extraction step (Francois et al., 2011). This robustness further reduces the cost as well as time to result.",

Our data demonstrate that the use of degenerate primers is a feasible method by which to design assays for targets of interest even when sequence conservation is limited. The assay was able to detect a majority of DENV PCR\u2013positive clinical samples obtained from South America (sensitivity of 86.3%), representing multiple circulating strains of DENV1\u20133; however, the clinical performance is limited with only 44 dengue-positive clinical specimens from 1 region and lack of inclusion of DENV4-positive specimens. The assay was also specific to DENV and did not react to other pathogens that cause similar fever-like symptoms. This demonstrates the assay's effectiveness for enabling differential diagnosis in a clinical situation with multiple strains and serotypes. Since this is a molecular assay, it will likely be able to detect DENV in mosquito samples and have further applications for vector surveillance. Due to the robustness of LAMP, it may be used without explicit sample preparation in applications where having false negatives for low copy number samples are acceptable and with integrated sample preparation where it is not. Acute DENV viremic patients have 103\u20131012 plaque-forming units/mL (Vaughn et al., 2000), and such high titers are detectable by LAMP without explicit sample preparation. The assay reagents can also be lyophilized for field expediency and provided in a single tube to which one may add hydration buffer and test sample. The assay can be run at a range of temperatures and can be performed using a water bath or other available heat source. We also envision the assay readout adapted to specific applications and present UV visualization, handheld fluorescence readers, and lateral flow ICTs as viable alternatives.",
