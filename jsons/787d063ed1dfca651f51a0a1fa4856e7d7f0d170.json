In some viruses, statin-induced reduction of cholesterol in the plasma membrane results in lower viral titres and failure to internalize the virus. Such data suggest that in some viruses, cholesterol affects the early stages of infection. In particular, in the initial stage of infection, viruses bind specific receptors concentrated within lipid rafts, areas of plasma membrane rich in cholesterol. Statins, by reducing the percentage of cholesterol present in the membrane, alter the assembly of the receptors and dramatically reduce the possibility of adhesion of the viral agent to the host. Lipid rafts are also involved in the viral replication phases, as they constitute packets of vesicles capable of concentrating virus replication factors. These processes are also highly destabilized by statins [2] .",
