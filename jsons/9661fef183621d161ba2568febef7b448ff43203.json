If the trend continues, it is probable that some will escape cultivation and become invasive in native ecosystems. We present a retrospective analysis of several structural, life history, and biogeographical attributes of woody plants introduced in North America to determine which traits characterize species that have and have not invaded. Predictive models derived from discriminant analysis correctly classified 86.2% of the species in cross-validation, whereas those derived from classification and regression trees classified 76% correctly. From these models we created a hierarchical predictive tree that allows the user to divide species into three categories: admit (low risk of invasiveness), deny admission (high risk of invasiveness), or delay admission for further analyses and/or monitor intensively (risk cannot adequately be assessed based on only the included attributes). We recommend that species that are highly invasive elsewhere not be allowed into the U.S. and that a more conservative introduction policy using a hierarchical predictive method be employed.",

The purpose of listing is to restrict movement of a known problem species, with action taken only after a species is shown to present a significant risk. The Act does not require the evaluation for invasive potential of \"new,\" intentionally introduced species at the time of introduction. The Act has been less than successful in preventing introductions of plant species capable of invading natural ecosystems for several reasons, primarily because it has been applied mostly to agricultural pest plants and because funding is inadequate. It has also been applied to too few species; at least 750 species meeting the Act's definition of noxious weeds still remain unlisted (U.S. Congress 1993).",

            "text": "There are four possible policy strategies that can be used for the importation and screening of invasive potential of plant species (Ruesink et al. 1995) : (1) all species can be admitted unless proven to be invasive and thus specifically prohibited (a \"dirty list\" approach); (2) all species can be prohibited unless known to be non-invasive and listed as such (a \"clean list\" approach); (3) each species can be tested for invasiveness before making a decision regarding entry; or (4) an informed estimate of invasive potential can be made about a species based on available information about other invasive species. Currently, the United States, in accordance with the Federal Noxious Weed Act, allows all plants into the country as long as they are not on a brief list of \"dirty\" species that are known to harbor agricultural pests or are known weeds. This is consistent with strategy number one above. Because there are very few restrictions limiting what can be introduced, botanical gardens, nurseries, agricultural organizations, and individuals can import plants and exchange seeds at will. The dirty list approach is commonly used to prevent interstate transport of harmful species, mostly fish and wildlife, but there is a growing realization that more systematic and formal methods need to be developed (U.S. Congress 1993). Changing to a \"clean\" (i.e., allowed) list approach by which all species would be banned from importation unless they could be proven to be pest-free and lacking in weed potential is one such method; species could be placed on the clean list and no further reviews would be needed for subsequent introduction of those species. The clean list approach is analogous to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulatory system for approving drugs for human use. The clean list approach shares, with the third alternative listed, the need to hold all plant material with unknown invasive potential in quarantine for an extended period of time. A long holding period is a politically and legally unfeasible, as well as expensive, solution for goods in trade. Holding the species in quarantine for an extended period of time to evaluate invasiveness may reveal little anyway, unless it is held for decades; many invasive species have a considerable \"lag period\" between introduction and commencement of invasion (Scott & Panetta 1993; Hobbs & Humphries 1995) . This leaves the fourth option, to develop predictive methods based on what is known about invasive species that will allow the evaluation of a species invasive potential prior to introduction. Approval for a species would be held until it was determined to have a low or high potential for invasiveness and could be placed on a clean or dirty list, with some questionable species perhaps held for further determination of invasive qualities. This would provide a more conservative approach and therefore provide more protection for the environment than under current laws and would be fair to those wishing to introduce species by allowing at least some species into the country quickly.",

These species were judged to have ample time to become invasive if they had that potential. We divided the species into two groups: invasive species (verified to maintain selfsustaining populations outside cultivation) and non-invasive (not documented outside cultivation). We identified the invasive species first by using the U. S. Department of Agriculture's National List of Scientific Plant Names (1982) , which lists species known to occur in the country, then verified their invasive status by checking herbarium collections and by contacting resource managers and others around the country. This research identified 235 species (list available from the corresponding author), 76 of which were considered by resource managers and other sources to be of particular concern and we designated these as \"pest species\" for some analyses. We judged a species non-invasive if it was listed in nursery and seed catalogs from early in the century, but had not been found outside of cultivation. A total of 114 species met that criterion. Other species may have been introduced prior to 1930 but because many were listed only by common name we could not identify them to species. The invaders in our sample represented 53 families and 125 genera, and the non-invaders were from 48 families and 80 genera. This broad representation provides sufficient phylogenetic diversity to allow us to detect and correct for correlations due more to common ancestry than to invasive ability.",

At each step the variable resulting in the smallest Wilks' lambda was selected by the procedure. We fit the models using a random selection of approximately 75% of the species and then tested the model on the remaining portion. Species that were missing variables for one of the at-tributes were omitted, reducing the total number of species used for that model. We repeated the process for a data set that included only angiosperms introduced into temperate North America (i.e., conifers and southern Florida species were omitted because the attributes unique to these two groups sometimes obscured the patterns present in the remainder of the species).",

The goal of CART is to predict what class a species is in, using an analysis of the structure of the data on that species. Unlike stepwise discriminant analysis no assumptions about normality are made and continuous measurements and categorical data are appropriately used (Brieman et al. 1984) . Unlike DA, CART does not search for a linear combination of attributes, but instead breaks down the data set attribute by attribute to develop a dichotomously branching \"tree\" for decisionmaking (Brieman et al. 1984) . The results are presented in a hierarchical binary tree classification that is easily translated into a simple method of predicting invasiveness. We treated missing values for attributes as we did for the discriminant analysis. We split the data randomly into 10 groups and fit a model to one of the groups, and then passed the remaining groups through the model to calculate a misclassification rate. These steps were repeated until a model had been fit to each group and tested on the rest. Once a tree was established, the lowest branch pair was \"pruned\" and the misclassification rate was recalculated. Successive branches were pruned until the lowest cross-validation misclassification rate was found on a simplified tree and that was considered the \"best\" tree. The procedure was performed on both the full species data set and angiosperms introduced into temperate North America, with the same attributes used in creating the DA models. We combined the results of these methods of analysis, as well as differences between invaders and non-invaders, for these attributes and taxonomic relationships (Reichard 1994) to create a decision tree that evaluates invasive potential using traits to create several different predictive paths. Several versions were tested using the attributes found to be important in the analyses and using the total species available. The version with the lowest misclassification rate was selected. Rather than identify the species simply as invasive or not invasive, this predictive model has three categories: \"admit\" (low probability of invasiveness), \"do not admit\" (very high probability of invasiveness), and \"further analysis needed\" (intermediate probability of invasiveness). The latter category acknowledges that some species cannot be easily distinguished because the risk of establishment cannot be sufficiently determined without examination of additional characteristics. It would require that the species be denied admission until additional information was considered. The decision tree uses only a portion of the attributes used in the discriminant analysis and further analyses of the unused attributes, such as the length of flowering and fruiting times and other attributes associated with invasiveness, such as self-compatibility and agamospermy (Reichard 1994 ) could be more decisive. Extensive post-introduction monitoring would also be a required component.",

Evergreenness, however, was still associated with non-invasiveness when conifers and all southern Florida species were deleted from the analysis ( Table 2) . Perfect flowers were associated with invasiveness, but this is strongly influenced by the lack of conifers (all of which have unisexual reproductive structures) in the invasive group for North America and their presence in the non-invasive group.

When \"elsewhere\" is omitted as a possible trait in analyses, however, an accurate predictive model is still possible ( Table 2 ). The ability to reproduce vegetatively, a trait used as a basis for predicting invasions in Australia (Panetta 1993) , was positively associated with invasiveness. The lack of pre-germination treatment requirements for the seeds was also correlated with invasiveness, a finding consistent with Baker's idea that a weedy species would have germination requirements met under many environmental conditions (Baker 1974) . A long fruiting period, evergreen leaves, a native range in temperate Asia or other parts of North America, and origin by interspecific hybridization were positively associated with the non-invasiveness. The discriminant analysis model using the full data set was created using 149 species (72%) and tested on the remaining 58 species (28%). The Wilks' lambda was fairly large (0.555), suggesting high variance within the groups, but the canonical correlation was 0.667, indicating that 67% of the variance was explained by the selected variables. It correctly classified 86.2% of the species in cross-validation (Table 3 ). The rate for correctly classifying invaders was very high (97.1%). Only one species, Celastrus orbiculatus, an aggressive pest of wooded areas, wetlands, and riparian zones in the east and midwest was misclassified. It was misclassified because, although it fits half the characteristics in the model of an invasive species, it is not known to invade elsewhere in the world, is dioecious, and is native to temperate Asia, all characteristics of a non-invasive species in this model. The model correctly classified only 70.8% of the non-invasive species; this asymmetry in predictive power characterizes all the DA models generated. A discriminant analysis model (Table 2 ) created using only temperate angiosperm species did not retain five attributes found in the full North American model. Of these attributes one, perfect flowers, was included in the North American model largely because of the influence of conifers (which are monoecious or dioecious) in that data set. The other four, flowering in winter, long fruiting period, cold chilling for seed germination, and origin in temperate Asia, are all attributes that, although important in many regions in North America, are strongly influenced by the inclusion of Florida species (Reichard 1994) , either because they were strongly associated with the species (the first two attributes) or strongly disassociated (the latter two). The model for temperate angiosperms therefore eliminated some regional and phylogenetic bias found in the full North American model. It retained the other attributes from the full North American model. The model was created using 169 species (70%) and tested on the remaining 71 (28%). It was comparable in accuracy, with 81.7% of the species correctly predicted (Table 3) . Forty-five of the 48 (93.8%) invasive species, but only 56.5% of the noninvasive, were correctly identified ( Table 3 ). The Wilks' lambda was high (0.661) and the canonical correlation for the function indicates that only 58% of the variance was explained by the attributes selected, perhaps resulting in the poor predictive power for the non-invasive species.",

Invasive species, on the other hand, are largely identified by vegetative reproduction and invading elsewhere. The full, unpruned model was 90.0% accurate in its predictions (Table 4 ) but, because it used all the attributes en- tered, it was more difficult to use. A pruned CART model created using only temperate angiosperms in the data set ( Fig. 2 ) was 96% accurate in predicting invasiveness in cross-validation using only two attributes: origin outside of North America or not an interspecific hybrid (Table 4 ). These attributes, although adequate for identifying invaders, failed to identify the non-invasive species; 45.0% correctly predicted is somewhat less than the 50.0% one would expect by chance. The largest portion of the misclassification is the result of the left arm of the model (Fig. 2) , where all non-invasive species are classified as either North American or interspecific in origin, an oversimplification.",

Of the 76 pest species studied 63% were in six families: Rosaceae, Fabaceae ( sensu lato ), Myrtacae, Salicaceae, Oleaceae, and Caprifoliaceae ( sensu lato ). Just as knowledge that a species invades elsewhere indicates that it has invasive tendencies, knowledge that a species is related to one already in- vading may indicate that they share traits related to invasive success through descent from a common ancestor. Like the discriminant analysis and regression trees, the decision tree also had high predictive value. Only three invasive species ( Picea abies , Betula pendula , and Poncirus trifoliata ), all minor invaders, were recommended for acceptance into North America (Table 5) . No pest species were accepted. One hundred and seventy-four species, or 85.0% of those evaluated, were rejected outright, including 88.0% of the 76 pest species. One-hundred and twenty-seven species were rejected for admission on the strength of their invading elsewhere, belonging to an already invasive taxonomic group, and not being native to other parts of North America. Even when that arm of the tree was excluded, however, only eight (7%) of the invasive species and only one pest species ( Ilex aquifolium ) were admitted unconditionally following the other paths in the chart, indicating that the tree may be effective even when information on invasiveness elsewhere is unavailable (although 89 species could not be re-evaluated due to missing information about a pertinent attribute). In the validation, 13.0% of the species were recommended for further analysis and monitoring (see below) before a recommendation for admission or denial could be made.

Because of the strong correlation between invading elsewhere with invading in North America, it is prudent to exclude species not currently invasive if they score positively for that attribute, especially if they are related to current invaders.

For instance, annual species in Great Britain were categorized by weediness and subjected to a number of analyses; only comparisons of congeners provided predictive ability by length of flowering time (Perrins et al. 1992) . Scott and Panetta (1993) used multiple regression to predict the weed status of southern African species introduced into Australia, finding that taxonomic and geographic variables associated with the species predicted agricultural weeds, but no variables predicted environmental weeds. Rejm\u00e1nek and Richardson (1996) , used discriminant analysis on pine species, finding that invasive pines can be accurately detected from non-invasive based on the minimum juvenile period, mean seed mass, and mean interval between seed crops. Other attempts such as Richardson et al. (1990) and Tucker and Richardson (1995) have utilized the characteristics of invaded ecosystems and the biological attributes of invaders to predict which species will invade. This method appears to be especially effective in systems that experience episodic disturbance. The disturbance removes barriers to invasion and successful invaders then invade in the following invasion window. The problem of invasions and the attempts to predict them are worldwide even though particular screening protocols and their acceptance may be influenced by the cultural history of nations.",

Using simple attributes available through published sources and on herbarium specimens, we attained overall predictive rates of 76.5% (CART) to 86.2% (DA). The single-most reliable predictor in the models was whether or not a species was known to invade elsewhere in the world, an attribute that is also a key component of a screening system proposed for Australia (Panetta 1993) .

Validation of the decision tree (Fig. 3) the species themselves dominate invasive ability. The ability of a species to invade repeatedly is likely related to reproductive attributes, although of those studied, only increased flowering and fruiting were correlated with the \"elsewhere\" attribute. Increased flowering time was associated with weedy annuals in Great Britain in a comparison of invasive and non-invasive congeners (Perrins et al. 1992) . It is also probable that still other attributes, perhaps physiological, are contributing to the ubiquitous success of the \"elsewhere\" invaders. The importance of this attribute also lends strong support to the need for a global database of invasive species such as has been proposed by the Survival Species Commission of the World Conservation Union (Clout 1994) and by the Adaptive Research Programme of the University of Oxford (see Worldwide Web site \u03fd http://ifs.plants.ox. ac.uk/wwd/wwd.html \u03fe for more information on the progress of the latter database). The greatest difficulty in the DA models (and in the decision tree) was not in predicting which species would invade, but which would not. Consistently the highest proportion of misclassification was in that category. Non-invaders appear to be best described in the CART model using all species, which identify them as not invading elsewhere, being native to North America, and being an interspecific hybrid. Further research into consistent non-invaders should both increase fairness of a predictive introduction scheme to the nursery industry and perhaps shed greater light on the biology of invaders as well.",

Because there are many strategies that would potentially lead to a successful invasion, no single set of attributes is expected to define an invader. The outcomes correspond to policy decisions that must be made: acceptance, denial of a species proposed for introduction, or delaying introduction until further analysis/monitoring is completed. The decision tree is flexible and would permit continued importation of non-native species, two premises fundamental to a screening system (Waterworth & White 1982) . It makes use of our growing understanding of the biology of invaders, puts the burden of proof on the group most likely to benefit from the introduction, and could do a better job of protecting our natural resources than does current policy. Introduction of new agricultural and horticultural species could be shifted to superior cultivars of North American natives, a shift that reflects current trends in water conservation and management (Sauer 1995) , and to the development of sterile interspecific hybrids. The latter should be considered with some caution; seemingly sterile interspecific hybrids can, through later chromosome doubling, become fertile (Marchant 1968) . Sterile hybrids that are capable of vigorous vegetative reproduction also should be avoided.",

Close examination of minimum and maximum temperatures and average precipitation in a species' native range may be helpful. The latitude range of the species may indicate the adaptability of the species to varying conditions and was suggested by Daehler and Strong (1993) to have high predictive value and some studies seem to have verified this (Scott & Panetta 1993; Reichard 1994; Rejm\u00e1nek 1995) . In addition, species should be studied for self-compatibility and agamospermy, attributes that differed significantly between invasive and non-invasive species in analysis (Reichard 1994) . The average number of seeds per plant produced in a growing season and the species' dispersal mode should be documented. Finally, the length of the flowering and fruiting periods differ between invaders and non-invaders (Reichard 1994) and may provide useful evaluative information. Data on physiological factors, such as tolerance of xeric conditions, should also be gathered because they may prove to have predictive power.",
