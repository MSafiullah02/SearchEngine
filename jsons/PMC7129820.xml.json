While high income countries, and countries with efficient healthcare systems could mobilize resources and technical manpower in an efficient manner, low income countries with poor health care system and political instability may not be able to contain viral epidemic on time,4 which could have devastating effects on public health and overall economy of the nation. The disastrous effects on public health and economy could be even more worse in the low income countries having weak capacity to effective diagnostic and treatment options, and lack of inter-sectoral collaboration leading to failure of timely containment and control of epidemics. Thus, it is imperative to resource poor countries, to rapidly detect and contain the virus at the point of entry, before the disease gets entry and establish within the country; otherwise it would be too late and humanity will suffer.",
