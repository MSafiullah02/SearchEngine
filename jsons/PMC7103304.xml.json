PEDV belongs to group I coronavirus which consists of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), feline coronavirus (FeCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and human coronavirus NL63 (NL or New Haven) (Van der Hoek et al., 2004). Among them, TGEV, HCoV-229E and FeCoV all use APN as their cellular receptor (Delmas et al., 1992, Yeager et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996, Tresnan and Holmes, 1998, Kolb et al., 1998). It binds to spike proteins of coronaviruses to mediate infection (Godet et al., 1994, Bosch et al., 2003).",

            "text": "PEDV and TGEV induce rather similar clinical symptoms which are hardly differentiated. Both of them replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine and cause severe diarrhea (Sanchez et al., 1992). TGEV could be propagated in many continuous cell lines, such as swine testicle (ST) cells and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. However, the propagation of PEDV had been unsuccessful until serial passage of the virus in Vero cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Song et al., 2003). It is known that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is a cellular receptor for TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992, Delmas et al., 1993, Hansen et al., 1998, Schultze et al., 1995), pAPN is a 150-kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in small intestinal mucosa, where aminopeptidase represents about 8% of the protein content of the apical membrane of the differentiated enterocytes and catalyzes the removal of single amino acids from the amino terminus of peptides for the final steps of digestion (Delmas et al., 1992). It is a type II glycoprotein, trypsin can cleave it into 2 subunits, N-terminal part (95 kDa) and C-terminal part (50 kDa). The region between residues 717 and 813 which contains the epitopes for three neutralizing antibodies is essential for TGEV infection (Delmas et al., 1994, Posthumus et al., 1990).",

Viral RNA could be detected up to 5 serial passages, and PEDV at serial passage 5 could infect Vero cells as judged by the dose-dependent infection effect. As for the control groups, the absence of pAPN results in the failure of virus replication in MDCK cell culture, and PEDV's presence in the cell culture.

MDCK cell monolayers transfected with pcDNA3.1\u2013pAPN expressed pAPN at a significantly high level compared with mock-transfected MDCK cells, ST cells and Vero cells (Delmas et al., 1992). This indicates that there is a direct correlation between the efficiency of viral replication and pAPN expression. In addition, the presence of PEDV antigens in pAPN-expressing MDCK cells was proved by indirect immunofluorescence. However, attempts to infect pAPN-deficient MDCK cells with PEDV resulted in a rather low level of antigen proteins as determined by immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, anti-pAPN antiserum could inhibit CPEs significantly with a dose-dependent effect. From these results, we deduce that high-level expression of pAPN correlates with high-efficiency replication of PEDV, and the susceptibility to PEDV was conferred by pAPN expression in MDCK cells.",

It is known that cellular receptor density plays a critical role for the entry of some virus, such as oncolytic measles virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Reynes et al., 2000, Anderson et al., 2004). As for natural PEDV infection, porcine intestinal tissues are rather sensitive and produce high-titer virus. In porcine intestinal brush border membrane, pAPN is abundantly expressed and constitutes of about 8% of the total membrane proteins. However, in ST cells, as shown in Fig. 2, the expression level of pAPN is relatively low. The expression level of pAPN may be an important factor influencing PEDV entry. From our data, it can also be inferred that the density of pAPN and PEDV infectivity might be correlated, since high pAPN amount and enhanced replication of PEDV originate from the same source. It is possible that in the presence of trypsin, MDCK cells with high level of pAPN expression are quite similar to intestinal villus membrane. Thus we speculate that compared with TGEV, the infectivity of PEDV maybe much more restricted by pAPN density.",

It remains to be determined whether pAPN is sufficient for viral entry in some cell lines or a secondary or earlier event is responsible for promoting entry. In another word, it is likely that multiple receptor molecules mediate PEDV infection or the replication is restricted at a post-entry step, and it is also possible that the modification of PEDV is needed. However, PEDV could infect Vero cells without pAPN. It may be due to other receptors or receptor-independent infection (Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002).",

After 36 h, virus-induced cytotoxicity was measured at 490 nm using CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The experiment was performed in 3 replicate wells for each antibody concentration.",
