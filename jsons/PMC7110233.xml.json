In the present study, we showed that viral infection of the upper respiratory tract induces release of the chemokines RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1 and release of the eosinophil product MBP in vivo. This is of interest, as both of these chemokines are eosinophil chemoattractants. While MIP-1\u03b1 is less potent than RANTES as an eosinophil chemoattractant, it is an important mediator in the inflammatory response to viral infection [12]. Furthermore, in a mouse model, absence of CCR1, which binds MIP-1\u03b1 most strongly, resulted in reduced host defense to infection and a tilt in favor of a Th2-type response to infection [13]. Given the role of Th2 cells in asthma, these properties suggest that both MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES may be important mediators of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. This observation is supported by the finding that levels of these cytokines in atopic children were 3-fold greater than in nonatopic children.",

However, such correlations are difficult to find in clinical studies where many variables may affect the strength of a relationship between two biologic measurements. For example, other chemokines such as eotaxin or IL-8 may also be involved, perhaps in concert with RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1. Furthermore, the finding of a correlation is still not proof of a causal relationship between two variables. In our view, the known biologic functions of these chemokines and the presence of increased eosinophil mediators is sufficient to support our hypothesis that these chemokines are important in eosinophil recruitment and activation in vivo. Further studies with chemokine antagonists will be required to test the strength of this relationship.",

Concentrations of GM-CSF in nasal secretions were mostly undetectable, suggesting that this cytokine plays a minor role in the pathogenesis of naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations. This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that GM-CSF plays a minor role in upper respiratory viral infections [14,15]. In a small group of children from whom enough clinical material remained, we also investigated the presence of IL-5. Although levels of IL-5 tended to be increased in the nasal aspirates from symptomatic children, there were no significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. The role of IL-5 in viral exacerbations of asthma must be further studied in greater numbers of children.",

GM-CSF was not detectable in most nasal aspirates, but IL-5 concentrations tended to increase in samples from symptomatic children. This study also found increased levels of the eosinophil granule protein MBP during virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. These findings suggest that the development of new drugs to neutralize the effects of RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1 on eosinophils may affect virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",
