DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed.",

ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95% vs 61%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100% of the ICU-patients.

While many patients remain asymptomatic carriers, others can show a wide array of symptoms, from mild flu-like manifestations such as dry cough, phlegm, myalgia or diarrhea to severe pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1, 4 The exact pathobiology responsible for severe and critically ill cases is still not clear. It has been proposed that a hyperinflammatory syndrome may play a central role in the progression from mild to severe or critical COVID-19. 6-10 Inflammatory factors are likely involved in this process and could become biomarkers of disease progression in the near future. 11,12 Judging from similar hyperinflammatory syndromes like bacterial sepsis, fluctuations of these biomarkers will probably be strongly interrelated and time dependent. 13 Until this process is fully characterized, biochemical parameters and physical examinations are the only tools available for tracking disease progression. Efforts are being made in order to fully characterize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nationwide.

We also found that critically patients had hypoalbuminemia, and that this remained statistically significant even after adjusting for possible confounders. To our knowledge, only two studies have reported similar data on albumin levels in COVID19, but these results have not been emphasized 5,23 . Previous research has shown that hypoalbuminemia is a strong predictor of 30-day, all-cause mortality in critically ill patients. 24 In fact, in our case series lower albumin levels were associated with mortality and length of stay ( Figure 3 ). Serum albumin levels on admission predicts the need of intensive respiratory support in adult patients with influenza A (H1N1). 25 Lower levels of albumin have also been associated with higher inflammation, hypercoagulation, and carotid atherosclerosis in people with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). 26 Interestingly, a recent report found that treatment with chemically modified albumin could confers protection against the entry of the Ebola virus in cells. 27 Albumin levels might be involved in poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients as well.",

Pro-inflammatory factors play a central role in COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with comorbidities. 6,10 The rapid virus replication rate along with interferon attenuation mechanisms and the accumulation of macrophages in the lungs seem to be important triggers of this \"cytokine storm\". 11 We believe that it is imperative to measure inflammatory cytokines involved in the cytokine storm that has been seen in COVID-19. Polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) are also likely to be involved in poor outcomes. [28] [29] [30] There is an urgent need to improve our understanding on the phenotype profiles behind the progress from mild to severe or critical COVID-19. To date, there is no specific treatment against COVID-19. In our cases series, 100% of the patients received a combination of antibiotic and antiviral treatments, and 81% received an antimalarial drug after being admitted to the hospital. Administering immunomodulators aimed to reduce COVID-19-driven inflammation comes with serious risks. Further studies are needed to characterize the effects of these drugs in cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients.",
