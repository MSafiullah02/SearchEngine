In addition, the age of children with MP has decreased and more severe symptoms have presented in older children during the past decade.6,7 In 2011, MP was more prevalent throughout the country and caused more severe clinical features than at any other time, which may be associated with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (unpublished observation).",

However, severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Although the exact mechanism of progression remains unclear, several have been proposed. For example, patients may develop antibiotic resistance8 or show an excessive immune response against pathogens, such as vigorous expression of cytokines and highly activated cell-mediated immune responses.9 Clinical studies have shown that systemic corticosteroid treatment temporarily improved the clinical symptoms of MP in children,10-12 which is suggestive of an overreaction of host immune systems. However, effects, optimal dose and timing of systemic corticosteroid treatment remain unclear. In the present study, we examined clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory and radiological findings, to evaluate the impact of high-dose systemic corticosteroid administration concomitant with antibiotics on refractory MP in children.",

Vital signs of all patients were checked every 2-4 h daily. Laboratory tests including white blood cell counts, serum aminotransferase and CRP, as well as radiological examinations were determined upon admission and followed up over time. M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed based on detection of M. pneumonia IgM using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy). The test was performed upon admission, and the positive cutoff value of IgM was established as >1.1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cold agglutinin titers of paired serum samples were measured at specific intervals after admission and a positive result was defined as an initial cold agglutinin titer of 1:64 or a fourfold rising titer in double-checked samples. To exclude other respiratory infections, we performed microbiological testing of blood and sputum cultures and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of several respiratory viruses-influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, human rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and metapneumoviruses-before antibiotic therapy. None of the tests resulted in detection of any other pathogens. All children with severe MP showed clinically high fever, respiratory distress, or initial lobar pneumonic consolidation with or without pleural effusion. All patients were treated initially with macrolides (clarithromycin or roxithromycin) or beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin with sulbactam or ceftriaxone). Since symptoms were aggravated despite antibiotic therapy, methylprednisolone was administered intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days. Refractory pneumonia was defined as follows: 1) Prolonged fever for 7 days or more or 2) persistent consolidation of more than one lobe of the lung despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, including macrolides.",

However, M. pneumoniae may induce pneumonia through local cellular damage by producing superoxide radicals and initiating the innate immune response, including the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2.9,15 Although cytokines and recruitment of lymphocytes play a role in minimizing lung tissue damage by activating host defenses, the immunological reactions ultimately exacerbate the immunological hypersensitivity and contribute to the development of vigorous cell-mediated immune responses, which can lead to pulmonary injury and induce severe clinical illness.15,16",

Moreover, the markedly elevated CRP concentration (6.7\u00b15.9 mg/dL upon admission and 10.1\u00b18.5 mg/dL before initiation of steroid therapy) reflected the acute severe systemic inflammatory reactions to M. pneumoniae infection, and was suggestive of a well-developed immune system. Previous reports associating the host immune status with M. pneumoniae infection showed that the clinical signs and symptoms of MP were more severe in previously healthy young adults, while the clinical manifestations of a relatively immunocompromised host were not as severe.5 These results agreed with animal study models.17 In animal studies, pulmonary lesions were not as severe in cell-mediated immune deficient animals compared to controls.17",

Although the effect of steroids on severe MP is controversial, some reports have shown that temporary steroid therapy results in clinical improvement in children with severe MP.10-12 Animal experiments showed that combined treatment of clarithromycin and dexamethasone reduced the lung histopathological score and cytokine levels more than either treatment alone.18 Steroids can exert immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects through several molecular mechanisms, such as inhibition of nuclear factor \u03baB, and also influence natural lung immunity by regulating alveolar macrophages and neutrophils.19,20",
