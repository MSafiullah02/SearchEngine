The standard precautions propose that patient blood, body fluid, secretions, and excrement have infectivity, hence isolation measures are necessary. These precautions affect both patients and medical personnel. Isolation measures include avoidance of direct contact with patients and air-borne particles, and require hand washing and sterilization, the use of self-protection equipment, the safe disposal of sharp instruments, etc.",

In this survey, it was found that nurse protection practices in the smaller hospitals were not as good as in the general hospitals. The reason for this may be that smaller hospitals are more basic, lack good infrastructure, and have no specialized infection administration departments. Additionally, not enough emphasis is put on the control of hospital infections. In terms of nurse working department, the compliance of nurses in the medical departments was lower than for those in the surgical departments. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p\n < 0.05), and is probably as a result of the greater number of chronic internal medicine and elderly patients in the medical departments. Also, there is no obvious presence of blood in the medical department, which may result in protection being neglected. These results indicate that the administration departments should focus on comprehensive monitoring, especially the monitoring of hospital infections in primary level hospitals.",
