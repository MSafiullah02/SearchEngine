            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia accounts for 20% of bloodstream infections with mortality rates ranging from 20 to 40% [1]. The latest Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections suggest that a single set of negative blood cultures is sufficient to demonstrate clearance of bacteremia [2]. However, our anecdotal experiences in which bacteremia cleared and then recurred, despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy, suggested that S. aureus might exhibit fluctuating blood culture positivity, labeled as \u201cthe skip phenomenon\u201d. Multiple studies of S. aureus bacteremia have addressed questions of treatment failure, relapse, and recurrence, although the definition of these terms has varied from study to study [3, 4]. Few smaller and older subsets of studies have described \u201cbreakthrough bacteremia\u201d, which refers to continuous or new-onset bacteremia whilst receiving appropriate antibiotics against the microorganism recovered in the blood cultures [5]. Breakthrough bacteremia may seem similar to the skip phenomenon; however, it is defined based solely on the presence of positive blood cultures while receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy and does not require previous documentation of blood culture clearance, which is the hallmark of the skip phenomenon. The skip phenomenon may be a distinct clinical entity that could have significant clinical implications related to treatment, prognosis, and healthcare resource utilization for patients with S. aureus bacteremia. The objectives of this study were to determine the overall prevalence of the skip phenomenon within a cohort of patients with S. aureus bacteremia and their clinical characteristics.",

Poisson regression models were used to test the difference in incidence of central venous catheter insertion between matched groups before and after adjustment for age, sex and duration of bacteremia, with GEE to account for matching.

There was a non-significant trend towards oxacillin susceptibility in the cases, contrary to previous studies that showed an association between methicillin resistance and recurrence [9].

However, the choice of primary antimicrobial agent did not reach statistical significance. A recent multicenter cohort study comparing cloxacillin and cefazolin for treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus bacteremia showed a similar, non-significant trend toward relapse in the cefazolin group [10]. Interestingly, a more recent cohort study examining cefazolin versus nafcillin or oxacillin for definitive treatment of MSSA bacteremia found significantly lower mortality rates at 30 and 90 days for those treated with cefazolin, though the same non-statistically significant trend towards higher rates of recurrent bacteremia was also seen in the cefazolin group [11]. In both studies, recurrence was defined as blood culture positivity following completion of antibiotics, which is distinct from the skip phenomenon. Contrary to this observed trend, results of a recent meta-analysis of 14 non-randomized studies showed that cefazolin was at least as effective as anti-staphylococcal penicillins for treatment of infections due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and was associated with lower rates of renal toxicity [12].",

Because the skip phenomenon involves an unexpected recurrence of blood culture positivity following apparent clearance, it has the potential to make the determination of true clearance more difficult, possibly placing these patients at risk of having central venous catheters prematurely placed. Based on these observations, it could be argued that serial negative blood cultures should be obtained to document clearance in patients with the clinical characteristics of the patients with the skip phenomenon in our study (i.e., males over 65 years of age with chronic immunosuppression and prolonged duration of bacteremia).",

Generally, case\u2013control investigations have a higher risk of recall bias, although we sought to limit this by nesting our case\u2013control study within an established, prospectively collected database.

The predominance of older males receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy with a prolonged duration of bacteremia among cases is noteworthy and prompts consideration to obtain serial negative blood cultures (with two sets drawn at least 48 h after the first negative blood cultures) in this subpopulation. Future work includes evaluation of large multi-institutional databases to further examine the skip phenomenon.",
