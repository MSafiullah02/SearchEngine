(2010) reported that female travelers were more likely to be younger, have shorter duration of travel, be tourists, have had pretravel advice, and were less likely to present for inpatient health treatment. Women had a greater increased risk of acquiring gastrointestinal and respiratory infections than men while traveling. Women are also more susceptible to urinary tract infections and are more likely to present with psychological stressors, adverse reactions to medications, and oral and dental conditions (Schlagenhauf et al., 2010). Women with preexisting conditions such as anemia, cardiovascular illness, or sickle cell disease may be at greater risk of air travel complications such as dizziness, fainting, deep vein thrombosis, or a critical health event (Hezelgrave, Whitty, Shennan, & Chappell, 2011). Pretravel health consultations are an excellent opportunity to assess and mitigate the risk of illness and injury for female travelers (Khan et al., 2016).",

The prevalence of these diseases varies significantly by region, and travelers should become informed of risks specific to their destination. Gastrointestinal illness is the most common travel-related problem, and travelers should be equipped with antidiarrheal medications and possibly antibiotics to reduce the severity of symptoms (Angelo et al., 2017, Baer et al., 2014, Leder et al., 2013). The second most common travel-related health problem is a febrile illness such as malaria, a potentially deadly vector-borne disease that affects about 250 million travelers a year (Leder et al., 2013). Malaria, caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes, is curable and preventable with chemoprophylaxis medications and proper vector control (CDC, 2020).International travelers can be exposed to changes in altitude, infectious disease, accidents, natural disasters, crime, and stress\n\n",

Men who visit a Zika-endemic area should use condoms or abstain from having sex with a pregnant partner for the remainder of the pregnancy. Pregnant women who are preparing for travel to tropical destinations that are endemic for malaria, dengue, or yellow fever should use an Evironmental Protection Agency\u2013recommended insect repellent, such as those that contain N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (commonly called DEET), and other types of mosquito bite prevention are very important for this population (CDC, 2020).",

Malaria can be more severe in pregnancy, and no prophylactic regimen provides complete protection. However, there are no contraindications for the use of antimalarials in pregnant women who are traveling to areas with a low to moderate risk of transmission (Korzeniewski, 2018). Consideration should be given to the identified chemoprophylaxis for the destination of travel and the safety level of medications taken during periods of pregnancy and lactation. The only options for malaria chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women are chloroquine and melfoquine, because the most commonly used medication, atorvaquone\u2013proguanil, is not recommended for use in this population because of potential fetal risks (Mayer, Tan, & Gutman, 2018).",

Pregnant women or those considering pregnancy should receive destination-specific travel-related vaccines such as hepatitis A, tetanus, typhoid, yellow fever, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza vaccines (Hagmann et al., 2017). Administration of vaccines during pregnancy not only will provide coverage for the mother but is likely to provide fetal and infant coverage through passive immunity. Influenza and tetanus\u2013diphtheria\u2013pertussis (Tdap) vaccines are safe and are recommended for all pregnant women, as are most inactivated vaccines, although specific data on use during pregnancy has not been obtained (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, McHugh et al., 2019, Swamy and Heine, 2015). However, several vaccines, such as any live-attunated versions, are often contradicted or are of questionable safety in pregnancy.Critical elements of a travel risk assessment consist of examining health status, destinations, duration, purpose of travel, mode of transportation, standards of accommodation, food, hygiene, and behaviors associated with health risk\n",

Typhoid fever presents with symptoms including fever, fatigue, headache, and anorexia. There are two types of vaccines that may prevent typhoid: one is a live attenuated oral form, and the other is a nonattenuated injection. Nevertheless, there are not enough adequate studies of either used in pregnancy (Swamy & Heine, 2015). However, a discussion with a health care provider of risks versus benefits is reccommended before going to a typhoid-endemic area. The CDC (2020) maintains a Vaccine Information Statement for every available vaccine in the United States that informs providers and patients about all the known benefits and risks associated with that vaccine. Providers should be familiar with the information in the Vaccine Information Statement so they can educate and provide screening before administration of any vaccine.",
