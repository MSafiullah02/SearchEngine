            "text": "Cerebral autoregulation (CA) defines the brain's capacity to provide stable CBF despite fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) over the range of 60\u2013150 mmHg. Impairment of CA can lead to disturbances in CBF that could play a role in the occurrence of PD due to brain ischemia or hyper-perfusion causing edema and capillary damage (Paulson et al., 1990). CA assessments are generally classified as being \u2018static\u2019 or \u2018dynamic\u2019 and can be performed by measuring CBF velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) with transcranial Doppler (TCD), simultaneously with BP (Tiecks et al., 1995). Static CA represents the CBF dependence on BP under steady-state conditions. Dynamic CA reflects the transient response of CBF to sudden fluctuations in BP (Aaslid et al., 1989). Worsening in CA efficiency has been shown to be associated with a wide range of cerebrovascular complications (Panerai, 2008). Impaired cerebral microcirculation has been reported in patients with PD and the high vulnerability of these patients to changes on cerebral parenchyma make CA a potential factor that could be used to explain the occurrence of PD (H\u00e1la, 2007, Otomo et al., 2013). Therefore, impairment on CA may be a marker for the development of delirium.",

Welch method was adopted for smoothing spectral estimates obtained with the fast Fourier transform (102.4 s segments, 50% superposition). Using the inverse fast Fourier transform, the CBFV response to a step change in BP was also derived and compared with 10 template curves proposed by Tiecks et al. (1995) to estimate the autoregulation index (ARI) (Panerai et al. 1998). Measurements were rejected if coherence did not reach 0.5 for any frequency below 0.25 Hz. Coherence is part of TFA, and represents the fraction of output power (CBFV variability) that can be linearly explained by the corresponding input power (ABP variability) at each frequency (Claassen and Meel-van, 2016). This parameter varies between zero and 1, and can be interpreted similarly to a correlation coefficient. Coherence will approach zero if the signal-to-noise ratio of measurements is too low, if the input-output relationship is non-linear, or if there are other variables influencing CBFV. In general, the 95% confidence limit of coherence is used to determine acceptance of parameters derived by TFA (Claassen and Meel-van, 2016).",

Christiansen et al. demonstrated intact dynamic CA in eight patients, six hours after cardiac surgery, in agreement with Preisman et al., based on 12 patients assessed 45-min after surgery (Preisman et al., 2005, Christiansen et al., 2015). These results may have been influenced by the relatively small sample size and the use of transfer function analysis limited to gain and phase (Panerai et al., 1998, Panerai, 2008). In our study, we calculated CA by ARI (Tiecks et al., 1995). The ARI incorporates all the gain and phase information, which are then aggregated and summarized into a single value. In this way, if smaller differences in gain and/or phase are not enough to lead to statistically significant differences, their aggregated effect, as part of the non-linear transformation involved in estimating the ARI (Tiecks et al., 1995) and lead to the ARI being significantly different. On the other hand, based on a larger patient group, Hori et al reported that reduced CA efficacy was associated with delirium, but in their study CA was assessed only during CPB (Hori et al., 2014). Our larger study, using ARI as a more robust index of CA (incorporating both gain and phase information), confirms that dynamic CA is impaired following cardiac surgery. Uniquely however, we also report that there is substantial improvement after seven days.",

In our study, the incidence of PD was only 25.4%, compared to other reports in the literature citing rates of up to 70% of patients affected after heart surgery (Brown, 2014). The relatively low rate of delirium in our case might have resulted from adherence to strict surgical guidelines and post-surgical nursing care protocols. Nevertheless, basing delirium diagnosis only on clinical signs detected by nurses and physicians, has been shown to have low sensitivity, and might under-recognize hypoactive forms of delirium (Inouye et al., 2001).",

Our results add to the existing literature about predisposing factors for delirium, we found that lower ARI before surgery was a risk factor and predictor of PD after cardiac surgery. Under normal physiological conditions, CA counteracts the changes in systemic blood pressure that occur during daily activities and several studies have shown a link between ARI impairment and cerebrovascular conditions (Panerai, 2008, Salinet et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2016), but ARI analysis before cardiac surgery has not been previously reported.

This is likely to be the case during 5-minute baseline measurements obtained at rest (Serrador et al., 2000). Additionally, a permeable acoustic window is needed for ultrasound to penetrate the skull, a well-known limitation of TCD, which mainly affects post-menopausal women. In our case, 10 patients had to be rejected due to the absence of temporal windows, which agrees with the 10% rejection figure found in international studies (Alexandrov and Bornstein, 2006).",

Several studies have shown that both ARI and phase are depressed in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis (Panerai et al., 1998, Panerai, 2008). None of the patients studied had symptoms of advanced carotid artery disease, but we cannot exclude the possibility that values of ARI could have been biased by the presence of asymptomatic carotid artery disease. Differences in the method of measurement of ABP, with the Finometer being used at T1 and T3 and an arterial line at T2, could also be seen as a potential limitation. However, a detailed previous study showed excellent agreement between the two methods for assessment of dynamic CA (Sammons et al., 2007).",
