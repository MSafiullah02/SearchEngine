All patients had a history of three or more different episodes of recurrent wheezing and documented evidence of wheezing by auscultation. Subjects with asthma were diagnosed according to the criteria of the Japanese guidelines.16 Briefly, a diagnosis of asthma was confirmed on the basis of a history of recurrent wheezing and dyspnea on at least three independent occasions, and reversible bronchoconstriction.16 Patients were prescribed short-acting \u03b2 agonists and/or long-term controller medications. We excluded children with obvious bacterial infections, congenital heart diseases, and chronic lung diseases as well as those who showed the presence of a foreign body, had signs of severe infection, or were immunosuppressed, as these complications can interfere with the assessment of asthma-related outcome measures. The control group included 13 healthy children (8 boys, 5 girls, mean/median age 3.7/4.2 years) with no symptoms of wheezing at the time of examination. Exclusion criteria for the controls included immunosuppression, the presence of other respiratory tract symptoms, or a history of previous wheezing and asthma. Controls and patient cases were age- and sex-matched. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Gunma Children's Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained from parents of patients and assent was obtained from the children if they were considered old enough (generally >9-year-old).",
