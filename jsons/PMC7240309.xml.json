The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996 is the federal law that establishes privacy requirements for patients\u2019 protected\nhealth information. Together these privacy laws establish rules that guide school nurses\nin the sharing of student information, even in times of public health emergencies. The\nU.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have\nissued special updates to privacy laws in response to the Novel Coronavirus Disease\nproviding certain waivers of typical privacy requirements and direction to allow the\nsharing of information during this public health emergency. The purpose of this article is\nto briefly review the privacy laws as they relate to schools, as well as to provide an\noverview of the recent waivers to assist school nurses, school administrators, healthcare\nprofessionals, and public health agencies in protecting the health and safety of students\nduring this current public health emergency.",
