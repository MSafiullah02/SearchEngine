The term \u201crecent\u201d has been defined as 2\u20133 decades. The term \u201cemerging\u201d was first given by Krause and Lederberg in 1981.[1] Thus, Lyme disease, Tuberculosis (TB), West Nile virus, Nipah virus, AIDS, and antibiotic-resistant microbial infections are all by definition, emerging infections. It is estimated that fatality rate of 17 million deaths per year worldwide is caused by rapidly spreading highly infectious diseases.",

It is an irony that both overuse and inadequate use can lead to drug resistance to the anti-infectives and these two different situations are seen in developed and underdeveloped countries, respectively.[7] In developed countries, these drugs are often overused. In underdeveloped countries, frequent availability of counterfeit medicines, premature stoppage of drugs due to cost, or other factors have the same effect in increasing the drug resistance. Over-the-counter availability and rampant self-medication greatly enhance the chance of resistance. A series of 46 confidential reports during 1999\u20132000 evaluating many such suspected counterfeit drugs from 20 countries confirmed that 32% of such drugs had either no active molecules or grossly inadequate quantity, extraneous ingredients, or impurities.[7] Prohibitive cost often makes the much less effective drugs be used as the first choice despite availability of the first-line drug. To complicate the situation, drug resistance once developed increases the cost of therapy and risk of adverse effects exponentially and reduces the success rate. This is exactly what happened in case of multidrug-resistant TB treatment. Artemisinin-resistant malaria was found in Combodia in 2009.[8] Drug resistance is now frequent in gonorrhea, Streptococcus pneumonia, HIV, and many other hospital infections. The latest addition to this list is superficial dermatophytes that are showing high degree of resistance to most of the available oral antifungal drugs such as fluconazole. Although the resistance at the pharmacological level is being investigated, clinical experience in the field level is alarming in many South East Asian countries including India.",

Human development has witnessed simultaneous and progressive alteration in the climate and ecosystem. These all have significantly increased the chance of transmission of animal diseases to the humans who have minimum or no inherent immunity to these animal diseases. Development of more severe, as well as drug-resistant mutant varieties of the organisms also play additive role in the emergence of the infections.",
