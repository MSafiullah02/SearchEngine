            "text": "Viruses are small infectious agents, which are found wherever there is a life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved\n[1,2]. There are millions of virus types\n[3]. Wherein, those virus species which have been reported were sorted into dsDNA, ssDNA, dsDNA-RT, ssRNA-RT, dsRNA, (\u2212)ssRNA and (+)ssRNA viruses based on their genome types; they can also be sorted into algae, archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, plants, protozoa and vertebrates viruses based on the general host categories according to the ICTV (International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses)\n[4]. These viruses can infect all types of organisms including archaea, bacteria, plants and animals\n[5]. Many common human diseases are caused by viruses, such as common cold, influenza, chickenpox, cold scores, etc. In addition, many serious diseases such as ebola, AIDS, avian influenza and SARS are also caused by viruses. What's more, many genotypes of viruses are responsible for cancers, for example, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human T-lymphotropic virus, and so on (\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus). Though there are three main theories on the origin of virus: regressive, cellular and coevolution origin theory, it is still unclear how viruses originated because they do not like other organisms forming fossils\n[6,7]. So studying viruses via molecular information has been the most useful means in investigating how they arose and evolved\n[6,8-10]. Success of viral genome researches will promote our understandings and solutions of numerous problems, including their origin, evolution, infection mechanism, disease treatment, etc. The genome sizes (defined as haploid DNA content) of viruses vary greatly between species. The smallest viral genomes \u2014 the ssDNA circoviruses, family Circoviridae \u2014 code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only 2 kb; the largest \u2014 miniviruses have genome sizes of over 1.2 Mb and code for over one thousand proteins\n[11,12]. Two main mechanisms have been implicated in changes of genome size: one is the accumulation of transposable elements\n[13,14]; the other is the accumulation of tandemly repetitive sequences\n[15].",

            "text": "Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, generally defined as simple sequences of 1\u20136 nucleotides that are repeated multiple times and are present in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome\n[16,17]. SSRs are ubiquitous and highly abundant in eukaryotic\n[18-21] and prokaryotic genomes\n[22,23]. DNA repeats are primarily expanded by three models: replication, repair and recombination\n[24]. Meiotic recombination plays a key role in the maintenance of sequence diversity in the human genome, and SSRs have been reported to be hot spots for recombination as well as sites for random integration\n[25,26]. Thus, alterations in SSRs lie at the center of DNA evolution and sequence diversity that drives adaptation; on the other hand, changes in repetitive sequences can result in deleterious effects on gene expression and function, leading to diseases\n[17]. The instability of SSRs was identified to be a pathway to lead to colorectal cancer\n[27]. It is now accepted that unstable maintenance of microsatellites occurs in about 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers\n[28,29]. Microsatellite instability is also frequently associated with other diseases such as ovarian cancers, malignant tumors of endometrium\n[30], small intestine\n[29], stomach\n[31], skin\n[32] and brain, etc. The features of microsatellite instability observed in bacteria, yeast, mice and man can provide general clues as to how genomes evolve and how certain instability could contribute to human disease\n[17]. Some pathogens use SSRs in a strategy that counteracts the host immune response by increasing the antigenic variance of the pathogen population\n[33].",

Parameter estimates and visual inspection showed that goodness fit of data varies greatly to different models; nevertheless, curves with the best goodness of fit were picked out for correlation analysis between SSRs (occurrence and length) and genome size (Figures\n2,\n3).

Power function and cubic model best fit for the data of genome > 30000 bp and \u2264 30000 bp group, respectively (Figure\n2B,C).

The data of genome size < 2 kb group are not in our consideration here, because too small sample sizes lead to statistical insignificance. Data presents such a trend that, for the same repeat class, the ratio of genomes with corresponding SSRs to all genomes increases with the genome sequence growing, although the genome distribution is uneven among different genome ranges (Table\n1). For example, the ratio of genomes with hexanucleotide SSRs is 0 in group of 2 ~ 5 kb, and it is 1.1% in 5 ~ 10 kb, 2.6% in 10 ~ 20 kb, 6.7% in 30 ~ 100 kb and 63.9% in > 100 kb group, respectively. For the same range of genome sizes, tendency seems to be that the ratio decreases with the increase of the length of repeat unit. For example, in the genome range of 10 ~ 30 kb, the ratio is 100% (mono-), 100% (di-), 98.7% (tri-), 19.2% (tetra-), 2.6% (penta-) and 2.6% (hexa-), respectively. Observed value per virus genome showed a rising trend with the increase of the genome sequence. Additionally, long repeat units such as penta- and hexa- SSRs were rarely, or even not, observed in small genomes, and certain repeat unit class distributed in genomes with a certain range of sequence length. All mono- and di- repeats were observed in analyzed genomes except Duck hepatitis B virus (S103-dsDNA-RT-2), Cryphonectria parasitica mitovirus 1 (S174-(+)ssRNA-4) and Nodamura virus (S206-(+)ssRNA-36) in which mono- repeats were not found; tri- repeats seemed to widely distribute in all virus genomes; and tetra- SSRs, as a common component, consist in genomes with size more than 100 kb (94.4% of the virus genomes contain tetra- in group of genome >100 kb); In contrast, it is rarely observed in genomes with size < 100 kb; and genomes containing penta- and hexa- SSRs are not more than 50% in < 100 kb group. Moreover, the number of tetra-, penta- and hexa- SSRs is very small in genome range of < 100 kb (Table\n1). Results indicated that the correlation is strong between length of repeat unit and genome size. The longer the genome sequence, the longer repeat units. For the same repeat unit class such as mononucleotide SSRs, the number of SSRs increases with the genome length increasing. It confirmed a preference that SSRs tend to accumulate in larger virus genomes.",

The sample with the size of 257 (n = 257 virus genomes) contains 6 variables (p = 6, including the percentages of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, respectively). Di- SSRs is the most and hexa- SSRs is the least on average, but the standard deviation is very large for each repeat unit class among the virus genomes (\nAdditional file 8). Even so, correlation is still strong and extremely significant between the original variables (\nAdditional file 9). The results showed that the two principal components with eigenvalues of 4.041 and 0.811 together can account for 80.869% of all differences of SSRs abundance among viruses. Wherein, the first component can account for 67.351% and the second 13.518% of all variances, respectively. Other components played a less important role in explaining the differences of SSRs abundance among virus genomes. The comparison of the parameters' coefficients for the first and second components showed that the first component has a major loading on the difference of SSRs during analyzing genomes (Table\n2). The results indicated that the SSRs differences among virus genomes are mainly due to the following parameters: mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-. Wherein, the variable of di- affects the differences of SSRs among virus genomes most strongly with the loading of 0.939, followed by tri-, mono- and tetra-. In this component, penta- and hexa- played relative minor role in explaining the differences of SSRs among virus genomes. In the second component, hexa- with high positive coefficient and tetra-, penta- with negative coefficients showed different effects on SSRs abundance. In this component, hexa- played the most important role in explaining differences of SSRs abundance. Overall, the results of PCA indicated that di- affected the SSRs variances among virus genomes most strongly, followed by tri-, mono- and tetra-; and then by hexa-; penta- played the weakest role in influencing the variances of SSRs abundance among viruses.",

            "text": "The previous analysis\n[34] simply considered the correlation between microsatellites and genome size based on relatively small sample with 54 complete Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomes, and they found that the number of SSRs is weakly correlated with genome size. We believe that Chen's result is lacking of statistical significance due to the relatively small sample size and uniform genome length. Here, the sample made up of 257 representative virus genome sequences was designed to investigate the relationship between SSRs and genome size on the level of the whole virus. The result of our data showed a very strong and significant positive relationship between the occurrence, or length of SSRs and genome size with the value of R2 = 0.919, P < 0.001 (Figure\n2A) and R2 = 0.915, P < 0.001 (Figure\n3A), respectively. That is, the longer the virus genome sequence, the more SSRs extracted. Hancock\n[15,35,36] confirmed that the simple sequence repeats were positively and significantly correlated with the genome size in both archaea and eubacteria, and SSRs accumulate preferentially in organisms with larger genomes. Moreover, there is evidence proved that short SSRs (1\u20134 bp length) exist in reduced genomes, but long SSRs (5\u201311 bp length) consist in larger genomes in prokaryotes\n[23]. The overall level of repetition in genomes is related to genome size and to the degree of repetition, and the entire genome accepts simple sequences in a concerted manner when its size increases\n[36,37]. A relative scarcity of repeating DNA is a major factor in causing the relatively compact size of the avian genome\n[38,39]. What's more, differences in genome size account for approximately 10% of the variance in genomic repetition in archaea and eubacteria\n[15], suggesting that other factors can also play important roles. DNA structure and base-stacking determined the number and length distributions of microsatellites in vertebrate genomes over evolutionary time\n[18]. Hosts are responsible for the variances of SSRs content to a certain degree. For example, with the similar genome size, viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates tend to be higher than viruses attacking bacteria in SSRs content, relative abundance and relative density of SSRs overall (\nAdditional file 15). This can be explained by the following statements. Genomes of reptiles are estimated to consist of about 30-50% repeats, birds have been estimated to consist of 15-20% of repeats\n[40,41], Mus musculus of 26.1%\n[42,43], and 44.9% of human genome were occupied by repeats\n[44,45]. While SSR tracts make up 2.4% of the E. coli genome\n[46], significantly less than vertebrates'. SSRs have been reported to be hot spots for recombination as well as sites for random integration\n[25,26]. Thus, the increase of viral SSRs content is maybe due to combining partial genome sequences of hosts in the process of infecting vertebrates and invertebrates. As we know, hosts evolved a number of defense systems in response to the challenge from parasites. Meanwhile, the parasites evolved multiple counter-defense mechanism as well under the selection pressure from hosts. Bacteria have developed CRISPR/Cas (CRISPR, Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Cas, CRISPR-associated) immune system to defend against bacteriophages by cleaving their DNA\n[47]. Antagonistic coevolution between bacteria and their ubiquitous parasites, bacteriophage (phage), is well known\n[48,49]. The genomic regions of CRISPR/Cas are hot spot of recombination, and CRISPR/Cas modules underwent rapid evolution in natural environments because of recurrent selection pressure exerted by coevolving viruses\n[50]. Meanwhile, viruses may combine partial CRISPR/Cas sequence in response to the counter-defense of bacteria. Therefore, it is no coincidence that SSRs content is high in both viruses that infect vertebrates and invertebrates and these hosts themselves. The recombination enhanced the virus's ability of infection and anti-immunity to a certain extent. Evolutionarily speaking, it is the result of selection in the process of interaction between viruses and hosts. It has proposed that reduced genome size represents an adaptation to the high rate of oxidative metabolism in birds, which results primarily from the demands of flight, and the relatively small genome size of birds in general may reflect the selective pressure to minimize the amount of repetitive DNA\n[51,52].",

Mono- and di- SSRs were observed in almost all analyzed virus genomes; tri- repeats appeared to widely distribute in all virus genomes but it's number is obviously less than mono- and di- SSRs; tetra- SSRs as a common component consist in genomes with size more than 100 kb (94.4% of the genomes contain tetra- SSRs in group of genome > 100 kb). In contrast, it is relatively rare in genomes with the size < 100 kb; genomes containing penta- and hexa- SSRs are not more than 50% in < 100 kb group. Moreover, the number of tetra-, penta- and hexa- SSRs is very small (Table\n1). Dinucleotide and trinucleotide SSRs were observed in all analyzed HIV genomes (genome size approximately 9 kb), but almost no tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were found\n[53]. Tetranucleotide SSRs are contained in 26.7% of the analyzed Potyvirus genomes (genome size approximately 10 kb), but the number of tetranucleotide SSRs is small\n[54]. The data of tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs are also rare in Mycoplasma, but they are relatively sufficient in bacterial\n[46,55], fungal\n[56], plant\n[57], vertebrates\n[39,41] and human\n[58,59]. Those results confirmed that SSRs distribution is closely related to the genome size, indeed. The accumulation of simple sequence repeats would be attributed to the results of selection in the process of evolution. It has been well known that viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a higher mutation rate to resist drugs, vaccines and so on during the process of replication and (or) recombination, which is one of the reasons for curing flu, hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with difficulty. Moreover, viruses lack complete repair mechanisms. Therefore, long SSRs can be poorly found in viruses. In the opinion of Mr\u00e1zek et al.\n[23], small genomes have a strong negative selection against long SSRs due to their strong constraints against expansion.",

Additionally, hosts are also responsible for the variances of SSRs content to a certain degree. For example, with similar genome sizes, viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates tend to be higher than viruses attacking bacteria in SSRs content, relative abundance and relative density of SSRs, overall. We inferred that maybe viruses combined partial genome sequences of hosts in infecting, resulting in relative large genome and high content of SSRs. Evolutionarily speaking, it is the result of selection in the process of interaction between viruses and hosts. Virus is a group of parasite, so studying of SSRs in viruses is helpful to the research of many etiopathogenesis of its hosts.",
