In this situation the organism is unable to detoxify reactive oxygen species, which accumulate, producing a harmful effect on the functional and structural integrity of biological tissues (Yilmaz, 2012). Cats seem to be more susceptible to oxidative stress and damage, probably influenced by the particular spleen structure of this species (Christopher et al, 1995, Harvey, Kaneko, 1977), and a situation of oxidative stress has been demonstrated in various diseases in this species such as diabetes mellitus (Webb and Falkowski, 2009), chronic renal failure (Keegan and Webb, 2010) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection (Webb et al., 2008). However, to the author's knowledge there are no studies about oxidative stress in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a viral disease resulting from feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection.",

Increases in acute phase proteins (APPs), which are markers of inflammation, such as alpha-1 glycoprotein or serum amyloid A can be used as a diagnostic aid in this disease.

Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a serum enzyme that has a protective role against oxidation (James, 2007). In humans, a reduction of PON1 activity has been reported in several pathologic conditions, including bacterial and viral infections (Farid and Horii, 2012). In addition, PON1 is associated with inflammation, being considered as a negative acute phase protein in several species. Feingold et al. (1998) reported a reduced hepatic synthesis of this enzyme in hamsters during the acute phase response. Decreases have been also described in cattle (Bionaz et al., 2007), laboratory animals (Franco-Pons et al., 2008), humans (Novak et al., 2010), horses (Turk et al., 2011) and dogs (Tvarijonaviciute et al, 2012a, Tvarijonaviciute et al, 2012b). Owing to the wide spectrum of species on which PON1 is reduced in inflammation, to study this molecule also in cats may be important.",

However, use of paraoxon as substrate would not be optimal due to its toxicity (Camps et al., 2009) and the possibility of analyzer contamination (Mogarekar and Chawhan, 2013). Divergences in the diagnostic performance between different substrates have been described in certain diseases (Dantoine et al, 1998, Keskin et al, 2009). Therefore, comparative studies in which various substrates are used for PON1 measurements would be recommended when this enzyme is evaluated in a new disease.",

PON1 activity was measured using three different substrates: pNA, PA and 5-thiobutil butyrolactone (TBBL) to evaluate the possible differences in the values of PON1 in FIP depending on the substrate. Assays for measurement of PON1 using PA and TBBL, and an assay for TAC determination, were validated for use in cats.",

Each pool was analyzed six times in a single assay run. The inter-assay CV was determined by analyzing the same pools in six separate runs on different days. Sera were frozen in aliquots, and only the vials needed for each run were used, to avoid possible changes due to repetitive thawing and freezing. Linearity was evaluated using the method of linearity under dilution. The pool serum with high values of PON1 and TAC was diluted on a two-fold basis with sample buffer and assayed by triplicate. The results were compared with those expected by linear regression analysis. The limit of detection of the assay (the lowest concentration of each analyte that could be distinguished from a specimen with a value of zero) was calculated as the mean plus 2 standard deviations for data generated from 20 replicate determinations of the zero standard (sample buffer).",

However, 5 cats with FIP and one cat with other inflammatory condition showed TAC values under the calculated limits of detection.

A significant decrease in PON1 activity with the three substrates was observed in both groups of diseased cats. The only report found about PON1 in cats studied the possible oxidative stress associated with obesity (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012c). There are several reasons that could explain a decrease in PON1 activity in cats with FIP. One of these reasons is oxidative stress, corroborated by the low TAC concentration in these cats. Oxidative stress is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of some human viruses. For example, hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione activity (Paracha et al., 2013) and HIV infection decreases PON1 activity (Parra et al, 2007, Parra et al, 2010) and TAC (Suresh et al., 2009). The presence of inflammation and increase in inflammatory cytokines that appear in cats with FIP (Regan et al., 2009) could also explain the decreased PON1 activity, since it is considered part of the innate immune system (Chun et al., 2004) and is a negative acute phase protein that decreases during inflammation (Novak et al, 2010, Tvarijonaviciute et al, 2012a), as it can be seen in our study in the group of cats with an inflammatory condition. Inflammation results in the loss of PON1 from HDL-cholesterol molecules, to be replaced by SAA (Kappelle et al., 2011). This could explain the increase in SAA and the decrease in PON1 demonstrated in cats with FIP in this study, indicating a pronounced inflammatory response, and the significant (although weak) negative correlation observed between SAA and PON1.",

Besides, it has been demonstrated that SAA shows similar response in FIP cats than AGP does (Giordano et al., 2004).",

Compared with PA, it is less toxic and has a lower limit of quantification (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012b). In addition, pNA assay can also be automated, thereby allowing higher specimen throughput and avoiding pipetting errors, which results in higher precision than TBBL which exceeded the recommended limit of 15% for inter-assay measurements (Guidance for Industry: Bioanalytical Method Validation, US, 2001). In a study performed in dogs, higher significance in the differences between dogs with oxidative damage and healthy dogs was found with pNA compared with PA or TBBL (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012b). Another important limitation for TBBL use is that this substrate is not commercially available.",

The knowledge of the pathogenesis of FIP remains at a very basic level (Pedersen, 2014a), and no studies about the influence of oxidative stress in the physiopathology of FIP has been undertaken. However, in other viral infectious such as HIV, changes in the various antioxidant defenses may also be associated with progression of the disease (Treitinger et al., 2000).",

It could be argued that the use of a lower cut-off (i.e. 1:25) would have allowed to detect more FCoV seropositive cats, however it is considered that coronavirus antibody titers can be misleading in the range of 1:25\u20131:1600 (Pedersen, 2014b).",
