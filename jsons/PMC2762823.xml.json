            "text": "Mammals meet their biosynthetic needs for one carbon donors by absorbing dietary folates in the acidic microclimate at the brush-border membrane of the upper small intestine [1]. Polyglutamate derivatives of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate constitute more than 90% of folate nutrients [2]. Prior to absorption, these congeners are hydrolyzed by gamma-carboxypeptidase to the monoglutamate which is the major blood folate [3]. Until recently, the reduced folate carrier (RFC, SLC19A1), which is expressed at the apical brush-border membrane along the entire intestine [4], [5], was considered to represent the mechanism by which folates are absorbed [6] despite the fact that the absorptive mechanism was known to have a different pH optimum and structural specificity [7]. Recently, a novel folate transporter (PCFT) was identified that recapitulates the properties of intestinal folate absorption [8]. Confirmation that this transporter is required for intestinal folate absorption came from the observation that loss-of-function mutations in HsPCFT are the genetic basis for hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) (OMIM 229050) [8], [9], an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in both intestinal folate absorption and folate transport into the central nervous system [10].",

Likewise, a low-pH folate transport activity, now attributed to PCFT, has been demonstrated in the intestine [1], [11], liver [12], kidney [13], and in human solid tumor cell lines [14], [15]. HsPCFT mediated folate transport can be distinguished from RFC mediated transport: (i) the former has a low-pH optimum (~ 5.5) while RFC has a pH optima of ~ 7.4. (ii) HsPCFT has a high affinity for folic acid and other folates (K\nm's range from 0.5 to 1 \u03bcM) at low pH which decreases as the pH is increased. RFC has a very low affinity for folic acid (K\ni\n ~ 200 \u03bcM) which, along with its affinity for other folates/antifolates, is largely pH-independent over a pH range of 5.5 to 7.4 [16]. RFC has a very high affinity (K\ni\n ~ 0.2 \u03bcM) for PT523; HsPCFT has a very low affinity (> 50 \u00b5M) for this antifolate [8], [17].",

To determine if this size discrepancy is due to post-translational glycosylation at these sites, membranes from HeLa cells transiently transfected with HsPCFT cDNA were treated with PNGaseF, which cleaves the bond between the first N-acetyl glucosamine of both complex and high mannose oligosaccharides and the asparagine residue in the canonical consensus sequence [25].

            "text": "\nHsPCFT is a recently discovered carrier protein that mediates intestinal folate absorption and transport of folates into the central nervous system [8]. HsPCFT is expressed in other tissues as well and a low-pH folate transport activity, presumably HsPCFT, is present in most human solid tumors and likely contributes to transport of folates in these settings [8], [14]. The murine ortholog of HsPCFT was reported to be a heme carrier protein, (HCP-1, SLC46A1), responsible for intestinal heme absorption that functions independent of pH (over a pH range of from 6.5 to 8.0) and with a low affinity for heme (K\nm\n = 125 \u03bcM for [55Fe]hemin) [28]. However, in studies from this laboratory [8], and in a recent report from another laboratory [29], it is clear that this is a high-affinity folate transporter (influx K\nm's in the range of 0.2\u20131.0 \u00b5M) with a low-pH optimum. Additional confirmation that the major, if not sole, function of this carrier is folate transport comes from the observation that loss-of-function mutations in HsPCFT result in an autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary folate malabsorption. Individuals with this disorder show no evidence of iron deficiency and the metabolic consequences of the transport defect can be corrected solely by the administration of pharmacological doses of folate [8], [9].",

            "text": "The data indicate that HsPCFT is highly heat labile; at temperatures above 50 \u00b0C the protein aggregates, a condition that must be considered in the preparation of cell membranes for SDS-PAGE. The basis for this aggregation is not clear but may be due to the properties of specific hydrophobic regions of the carrier as reported for SARS-CoV membrane protein [30]. On SDS-PAGE the wild-type protein ran as three bands at ~ 55 kDa, ~ 47.2 kDa and ~ 35.1 kDa. The three independent approaches used to assess HsPCFT glycosylation status yielded a deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular size of ~ 35 kDa, 15 kDa smaller than the predicted size for nonglycosylated HsPCFT (~ 50 kDa). Further studies using HsPCFT HA tagged on the N- and C-termini excluded the possibility that this discrepancy is due to degradation of the protein. This anomalous electrophoretic behaviour is quite common among polytopic membrane proteins and is similar to what has been reported for the human norepinephrine [31] and glycine transporters [32]. This could be due to (i) the highly hydrophobic nature and basic pI of the transporter [33] and/or, (ii) preservation of the native, compact conformation and decreased SDS binding due to the heating limitation resulting in incomplete denaturation of the HsPCFT protein [34], [35]. Decreased SDS binding may decrease the migration rate by reducing the net charge; alternatively, it may increase the migration rate by reducing the mass and frictional drag. The intact disulfide bonds, which usually result in less SDS binding of a more compact shaped protein, can also cause faster migration rates [36]. However, there was no difference in the HsPCFT migration pattern when membranes were prepared with or without DTT before loading onto the gel. Replacement of the seven native cysteine residues with serines had no effect on HsPCFT function; hence, disulfide bonds are not required for proper HsPCFT folding and function (Unal ES et al., unpublished).",

It is of interest that HsPCFT may be glycosylated to a different extent in different cells. Hence, ~ 60 kDa and ~ 78 kDa size HsPCFT proteins were detected in HepG2 cells and Xenopus oocytes, respectively [8].

This is consistent with a topological model in which the N-terminus is localized to the cytoplasm. This configuration was supported by immunocytochemical analysis of both wild-type and deglycosylated HsPCFT constructs HA tagged at the amino terminus, visualized at the plasma membrane only when cells were first permeabilized with Triton X100 [39], [40], [41], [42]. This data also supports a model in which there is an even number of transmembrane domains, requiring that the C-terminus is also localized to the cytoplasm.

On the other hand, N-linked glycosylation can play a role in proper folding of the polypeptide chain, protection from proteolytic degradation [45], maintenance of protein solubility [46] and targeting to subcellular compartments and to the cell surface [47]. The latter role of glycosylation has been reported for many transporters such as the human norepinephrine [31], glycine (GLYT1) [32], glucose (GLUT1) [48], organic anion (OAT4) [47] and organic cation transporters [49]. In these cases the transport proteins are heavily glycosylated on three or more asparagine residues and the deglycosylated protein retains only a small percentage of wild-type activity. In contrast, HsPCFT is glycosylated only on asparagine 58 and 68 and the majority of HsPCFT transport function was preserved in the N58Q/N68Q-HsPCFT mutant. Indeed, the small decrease observed could be due to the amino acid changes per se rather than the absence of glycosyl moieties since, at a tunicamycin concentration sufficient to completely abolish glycosylation, no significant decrease in HsPCFT function could be detected.",
