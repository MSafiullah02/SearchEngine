However, endometrial stroma in adenomyosis is commonly attenuated or has a fibrotic appearance in routine H&E preparations. CD10, the most widely used immunohistochemical marker of endometrial stroma, has limited value in this scenario. While it is consistently expressed in areas of adenomyosis involved by tumor, it also highlights reactive/desmoplastic mesenchymal cells surrounding myoinvasive adenocarcinoma as well as some lymphocytes. Therefore, CD10 is commonly positive in areas of myometrial invasion, resulting in low specificity.6,7 Attention to the distribution of CD10 staining around the suspicious focus may be of value, since it tends to be diffuse and circumferential in adenomyosis and patchy in myoinvasion. For diagnostic purposes, absence of CD10 staining is a strong indicator of myometrial invasion. However, such a scenario is rather infrequent: 0% to 48% in previous reports6,7 and only 15.8% in our study. Thus, more specific markers of endometrial stromal differentiation are needed.",

We demonstrate that IFITM1 immunohistochemistry is useful in this scenario and superior to CD10 as a more specific marker of endometrial stroma. Since IFITM1 was negative in all definitive myoinvasive areas, the presence of IFITM1 staining virtually confirms adenomyosis and excludes myometrial invasion. Based on these data, IFITM1 positivity would help classify as noninvasive up to 45.8% of areas with diagnostic uncertainty or disagreement. In practice, these results indicate that IFITM1 immunohistochemistry can potentially prevent overinterpretation of myometrial invasion and incorrect upstaging. On the other hand, a negative IFITM1 result was also seen in definitive adenomyosis; thus, such a result will not entirely confirm myoinvasion. It is important to note that adenomyosis involved by tumor may be completely devoid of stroma (\u201cstroma-poor\u201d adenomyosis), in which case distinction from true myometrial invasion will rely solely on morphologic examination.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of myometrial invasion arising from deep adenomyosis is challenging, particularly when carcinoma is present only in adenomyosis and absent in the endometrial surface, a rare but well-documented phenomenon.20,21 Careful microscopic examination will help: invasion should be considered if there is contour irregularity with finger-like or frankly infiltrative glands arising from a well-demarcated glandular area. In addition, attention to the distribution of IFITM1 staining may prove useful. In our study, 71.4% of areas identified as adenomyosis showed IFITM1 staining in more than 50% of the area circumference (score 2 or 3), with a mean distribution score of 2.02. Conversely, distribution score was 0 or 1 in all myoinvasive areas (meaning expression ranging from absent to less than 50% of the focus circumference). Thus, in a focus of adenomyosis with contour irregularity, IFITM1 will stain diffusely in the smooth, noninvasive parts of the focus circumference and will conversely be patchy or absent in the irregular, invasive parts. Given the rarity of this diagnostically challenging scenario, further studies and exploration of our hypotheses are required.",
