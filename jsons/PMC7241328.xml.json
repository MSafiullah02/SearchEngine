Patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) are currently millions, while a portion around 15% of them contracts the severe form of the disease (Cortegiani et al., 2020). Since currently there is no specific medicinal treatment, existing medicines used to treat other diseases are administered and tested in COVID-19 patients in the light of drug repositioning. In this context, chloroquine (CQ) is widely used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection since it can decrease the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of the associated pneumonia (Colson et al., 2020, Yao et al., 2020).",

It is worth mentioning that CQ apart from its antimalarial efficacy, exerts also anti-inflammatory and direct antiviral effects against retroviruses, flaviviruses, HIV, Zika virus, and coronaviruses (Savarino et al., 2003; Delvecchio et al., 2016). CQ interferes with the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV2 cellular receptors and also alters the endosomal pH needed for virus-cell fusion (Avdic, 2020). CQ inhibits the attachment of viruses to the human respiratory cells, which is facilitated by the spike SARS-CoV2 protein (Fantini et al., 2020). The immunomodulant effects are mediated by the reduction in T cell activation and differentiation, and suppression of cytokines produced by B- and T- lymphocytes (such as IL-1, IL-6) which are elevated in the body inflammatory response against the viruses (Avdic, 2020). The first intimations of the possible CQ effect on SARS viruses were proposed as early as in 2003 (Savarino et al., 2003). A common characteristic of the COVID-19 patients is the probability of a clinical worsening in the second week of infection which cannot be directly attributed to SARS-CoV2, but it might be linked to an immunological response. Thus, both the anti-inflammatory and the direct antiviral properties of CQ make it capable of treating COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020). Currently, CQ is fully considered for controlling the late phase cytokine storm occurring in COVID-19 patients and the US FDA has released on March 28, 2020 an emergency use authorization for CQ to treat COVID-19 patients (Bright, 2020).",

A serious condition is prolongation of the QT interval, with a potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias especially after long-term treatment (Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016). The extent of QT prolongation can increase with high doses. Cardiomyopathy is another serious incident that might occur with CQ treatment leading to heart failure, with sometimes fatal outcome (Chatre et al., 2018). Again, high CQ plasma levels and long-term therapy are risk factors for cardiomyopathy. It should be underlined that the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy are highly increased after co-administration with azithromycin and warnings have already imposed by the FDA (Svanstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2012, Mosholder et al., 2013; FDA, 2013). In addition, the CQ-azithromycin combination with fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) is definitely cardiotoxic and should be avoided (Svanstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2012, Mosholder et al., 2013; FDA, 2013). Diffuse parenchymal lung disease can appear to a small portion of patients, while respiratory failure and subsequent death can occur at high doses. Severe hypoglycemia, with the accompanying symptoms like loss of consciousness, can be life threatening for the patients treated with CQ and therefore they should have their blood glucose levels monitored closely. Eye/vision disorders can appear usually after long term CQ treatment, whereas when total CQ intake exceeds 1.6 g/kg, corneal changes and retinal damage can be irreversible. Some COVID-19 patients complaint also for symptoms like dizziness, drowsiness, headache, blurred vision, diplopia, increased excitability, and convulsions which typically can occur at higher CQ doses. In addition, there are complaints from patients for symptoms like involuntary movements of the tongue, tonic muscular spasms, dystonia (namely, extrapyramidal symptoms), which can be a result from CQ treatment. Myasthenia type symptoms and liver disorders can also happen and many patients now suffer from them. It has to be highlighted that patients with G6PD deficiency should take CQ with special caution due to the risk of hemolysis.",

Mild to moderate CQ overdose leads to nausea and vomiting, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, neuropsychiatric side effects, headache, and visual disturbances (e.g. blindness). Severe overdose can result in patient convulsions, depressed myocardial contractility, cardiac arrhythmias (however, correction with anti-arrhythmic drugs like those with quinidine-like effect should be avoided), severe hypokalemia, shock, and finally death through respiratory and circulatory collapse. Therapeutic treatments of CQ overdosing include early administration of adrenaline (to restore systolic blood pressure) and diazepam administration (to reduce CQ induced cardiotoxicity). Since CQ is eliminated from the body after several weeks/months, due to extended distribution to peripheral tissues, caution is needed to avoid overdosage. Hemodialysis or other types of dialysis (e.g. peritoneal dialysis) do not appear to exert benefit.",

This implies that it is rapidly absorbed and in high percentages. Indeed, the bioavailable fraction of CQ absorption is 89% and peak plasma concentration are reached within 1-3 h after intake (Avdic, 2020; Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016; Verbeeck et al., 2005). Antacids and acidic beverages can reduce absorption, while food increases bioavailability (and also reduces nausea/vomiting). A portion of 50-65% CQ is bound to plasma proteins, while the volume of distribution can be very high (up to 800 l/kg) indicating the extensive CQ distribution in peripheral tissues like lungs, eyes, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. Due to its extensive distribution, the elimination half-life of CQ ranges from 20 to 60 days. Elimination occurs due to renal clearance and metabolism (in an almost equal proportion). The CQ kinetics have been found to be linear over the dose range 2-15mg/kg (of CQ base).",

            "text": "In patients with impaired renal or liver function (e.g. elder people), officially, no dossing adjustment is required (Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016). However, for elder patients, special concerns are raised, because it more likely to have kidney and/or liver problems and dose adjustment might be needed to avoid CQ accumulation (Mayo clinic, 2020). In the subsequent analysis performed in this study, the impact of renal/liver impairment on the rise of concentration levels is revealed. In case of children, despite the fact that they exhibit higher clearance values than adults, children appear more sensitive to the effects of CQ (Zhao et al., 2014; Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016; Mayo clinic, 2020). Pregnant women are advised to avoid CQ, since high CQ doses can lead to fetal abnormalities like ototoxicity, cochlear dysfunction, and visual loss (Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016). However, depending on the judgment of the physician the potential benefit can outweigh risk. Reported results on the safety of CQ during pregnancy reveal that CQ can be safe even after a relatively high dosage of 500mg/day (Klinger et al., 2001). CQ is excreted in breast milk at around 2.8%, a portion which is inadequate for infant chemoprophylaxis, but it may cause disorders (even though it is considered low to be harmful). The physician should weigh the therapeutic benefit against potential risk for the infant. However, adequate studies are missing (Avdic, 2020; Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016; Mayo clinic, 2020). Finally, is should be kept in mind that CQ is metabolized by CYP2D6, an enzyme system with variable expression among individuals. For example, 7% of North Americans are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, while a portion 1-2% of them are ultra-rapid metabolizers (Juurlink, 2020). Since, genetic variability, can significantly alter CQ levels (and therefore efficacy/safety profile), it has to be taken into account where possible.",

Dosage regimens that are currently proposed either for the treatment of COVID-19, or for parasitic infections were investigated through simulations in order to explore their impact on safety. The simulations were performed using population pharmacokinetic models already proposed in the literature for CQ (Zhao et al., 2014, H\u00f6glund et al., 2016, Karunajeewa et al., 2010, Salman et al., 2017). For adults, all proposed models were quite similar and their differences refer to the use either of lag-time during absorption, or a transition compartment. For the simulations performed in this study, the selected model refers to a two-compartment model, with absorption lag time and first order kinetics for all transfers (absorption, elimination, inter-compartmental) (Zhao et al., 2014). In the literature models, body weight was found to be a significant covariate for volumes of distribution and clearances. For the volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartment an allometric exponent of 1 was used, while for clearance and inter-compartmental clearance an allometric exponent of 0.75 was utilized (Zhao et al., 2014). The reference patient of the study was considered to be: 70kg, 40 years old, with body mass index 15kg/m2, and body surface area of 1.73m2. Other situations like patients with different weights and altered renal/liver function were also simulated. All population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates, as well as the between-subject and residual error models, were those quoted in the literature (Zhao et al., 2014).",

Another worth notable finding is the fact that large fluctuations can be observed at steady state.

The addition of each new dosing scheme is made in subsequent plots in order to allow the reader to identify it easier. As it is expected, increasing the \u201cseverity\u201d of dosing scenario higher concentrations are achieved, but in a different way. It is worth mentioning that the already proposed scenario \u201c3\u201d of Table 1 results in very steep increases during the first day of the treatment, while from the second day the achieved levels are almost equivalent to those from the scenarios \u201cnew2\u201d and \u201cnew3\u201d. Bearing in mind that steep increases can be harmful, it is proposed that in case of need, scenarios \u201cnew2\u201d and \u201cnew3\u201d should be chosen instead of the existing scenario \u201c3\u201d. If the physician decides for even higher CQ levels, then the \u201cnew4\u201d scenario can be used, since it leads to high concentration levels in a mild way, namely, avoiding steep increases. It is interesting to note some additional characteristics of the \u201cnew4\u201d scenario which is considered as the most aggressive of all the \u201cnew\u201d scenarios: a) the use of a total dose of 1,250mg (i.e. 500+500+250) the first day is in accordance with the maximum safe dose of 20mg/kg outlined above, b) It achieves higher concentrations than the existing scenario \u201c3\u201d and lower than the typical case of scenario \u201c1\u201d (500mg x 2), c) The initial concentration increases are milder than scenario 3, since the total daily dose is split into three doses (instead of two). These features make scenarios \u201cnew3\u201d and \u201cnew4\u201d safer dosing alternative for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients, whereas scenarios \u201cnew1\u201d and \u201cnew2\u201d can be used in patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

In this case, the situation of a patient who starts CQ treatment early after the development of first symptoms is simulated. This patient is considered to start CQ at low dose (250mg x 2) immediately and is compared to other patients who start treatment three days later. Visual observation of Fig. 4 clearly reveals that the patient who initiated early CQ treatment exhibits the same plateau levels after three days with patients started later, but using much more aggressive regimens. In particular, in the early initiation patient only a low dose of 250mg x 2 is given, compared to the much higher doses of 500mg x2 (scenario 1: red line) and the scheme with the loading dose (scenario 3: green line). In other words, the early initiation of treatment with low doses, offers several advantages such as the achievement of the desired levels in a non-aggressive way, avoidance of steep concentration increases and subsequent toxicities, cover the patient with low CQ doses which are rather safe, whereas depending on patient\u2019s condition the dosing scheme can be increased. Even though, chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV2 using chloroquine is another issue, these results indicate the benefits of low dose CQ administration in terms of safety and its subsequent clinical implications. However, other studies are required to unveil the potential role of CQ in chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV2.",
