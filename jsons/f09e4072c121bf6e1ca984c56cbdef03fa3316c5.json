At low temperatures, iQC and 2/1 ACs exhibit spin-glass-like freezing for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho, while Er and Tm systems do not show freezing behaviour down to the base temperature ~ 2 K. The 1/1 ACs exhibit either spin-glass-like freezing or antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering depending on their constituent Mg content. The Tf values show increasing trend from iQC to 2/1 and 1/1 ACs. In contrast, the absolute values of Weiss temperature for iQCs are larger than those in 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, indicating that the total AFM interactions between the neighboring spins are larger in aperiodic, rather than periodic systems. Competing spin interactions originating from the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida mechanism along with chemical disorder of Cd/Mg ions presumably account for the observed spin-glass-like behavior in Cd-Mg-RE iQCs and ACs.",

Based on their atomic structure, iQCs can be classified into three subclasses, namely the Mackay- [3] , Bergman- [4] and Tsai-type [5] . The Tsai-type subclass, in particular, comprising the binary i-CdREs (rare-earth) [6] , ternary i-CdMgREs [7, 8] , i-AgInREs (RE = Yb) [9] , i-AuAlREs (RE = Yb, Tm) [10, 11] , and so forth might be considered as the largest of the three. Figure1a illustrates shell structure of the Tsai-type iQCs [12, 13] . Magnetic properties of the Tsai-type iQCs in the Cd-RE and Cd-Mg-RE systems with trivalent REs (i.e. excluding Yb) have been investigated in a number of studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The results are summarized as follows: the temperature dependence of the magnetization follow the Curie-Weiss law at high-temperatures. The effective magnetic moments are consistent with free RE 3+ ions. At low temperatures, iQCs in Cd-RE and Cd-Mg-RE exhibit spin-glass-like freezing behavior. The short-rangemagnetic correlations in the spin-glass-like state has been observed in the A-Mg-RE (A = Zn or Cd) QCs at low temperatures using neutron scattering [14] . Magnetic properties of the iQCs (in both binary Cd-RE and ternary Cd-Mg-RE systems) are summarized in Table 1 .",

With compared to the 1/1 AC (with a space group of Im3\u0304), the structure of the 2/1 AC (Pa3\u0304) is closer to the iQC (Pm3\u03045\u0304) [20, 21] . The configurations of RE atoms within the unit cells of the 1/1 and 2/1 ACs are illustrated schematically in Figures1b and 1c, respectively. Note that in the former, there exist 24 RE sites that are symmetrically equivalent. They form the icosahedral shells of the RTH clusters. In the latter, on the other hand, the 104 RE sites are divided into five Wyckoff orbits, represented by spheres of different colours in Figure 1c , all of which except RE4 belong to the icosahedral shells of the RTH clusters. The four dimers of RE4 sites are arranged on the long body diagonals of the four acute rhombohedron units which fill in the gaps between the RTH clusters [12] .",

            "text": "As-cast Cd-Mg-RE (RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) alloys were prepared by encapsulating three grams of starting elements into stainless-steel tubes employing arc-welding under Ar atmosphere. The tubes were further placed inside quartz tubes under depressurized Ar gas (~550 Torr). Based on the developed pseudo-binary phase diagram [28, 29] , the Consequently, alloys with nominal compositions of Cd65Mg23RE12, Cd65Mg22RE13 and Cd65+xMg20-xRE15 (x = 0 for RE = Tb, and x = 10 for RE = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) were carefully selected to synthesize single-phase polycrystalline iQC, 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, respectively. Despite several attempts, no 2/1 AC but 1/1 AC is detected in an alloy with nominal composition of Cd65Mg22Gd13. Investigating the effects of Mg addition on magnetic behaviours of the 1/1 ACs falls outside the scope of the current paper and thus is left for future work. The heat treatment protocols for synthesizing iQC and ACs are as follows: after an initial melting of the prepared alloys at 973 K, iQC and ACs were isothermally annealed at 673 K for over 140 h and 773 K for over 100 h, respectively. Microstructures and local compositions of the prepared samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. The specimens for TEM observation were prepared using 'crush-and-float' method during which the samples were crushed in ethanol and lightly floated pieces were then transferred to a Cu grid. For electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, the surface of the samples was polished by ion bombardment machine with accelerated voltage, gun current, milling time and ion angle of 2 kV, 2 mA, 3 h, and 12\u00b0, respectively. Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD; Mac science M03XHF22) with Cu-K \u03b1 was used for the phase identification of the prepared alloys. The temperature dependence of the dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in a temperature range of 2 -300 K under 100 Oe using superconducting quantum interfering device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-XL). The data collection was conducted for both zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) conditions. The ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out for frequencies varying from 0.1 to 10 Hz in the temperature range of 2 -20 K under zero external magnetic field. As seen, while the iQC represents sharp diffraction spots inflating in \u03c4 order, the pattern obtained from the 2/1 AC in Figure 3h exhibits zig-zag array of diffraction peaks (indicated by arrows) originating from a linear phason strain in the atomic structure [30] . The SAED pattern of the 1/1 AC in Figure 3i represents a larger displacement of diffraction spots from ideal positions indicating a larger magnitude of linear phason strain in the structure compared to the 2/1 AC. The results provided in Figure 3 evidence a systematic and successive deviation of the atomic structure in, respectively, 2/1 and 1/1 AC from an ideal iQC symmetry. This is of special interest in the present study since it offers a unique opportunity to obtain a possible trend in their magnetic behavior by performing magnetic susceptibility measurements. Figure 4 depicts the edge length of a surface rhombi in the RTH cluster (aq), definition of which is shown in the inset of figure for clarity, obtained from iQC, 2/1 and 1/1 ACs in Cd-Mg-RE systems. While aq is the quasilattice constant for iQC, aq in ACs may be calculated from their measured lattice parameters (aq/p) by neglecting possible distortion of the RTH cluster due to slightly different local atomic configuration in iQC and ACs, using the following equation:",

Such bifurcation is associated with the spin-glass-like freezing. For further confirmation of the spin-freezing phenomenon, the temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility of the 2/1 AC in the Cd-Mg-Ho system was measured under selected frequencies between 1 to 100 Hz. The result is shown in Figure 6a . The position of the cusp (Tf) is shifted about 0.6 K to the higher temperatures, and the magnitude is reduced by 9.43 %, as the frequency is increased from 1 to 100 Hz.

Moreover, magnetic susceptibilities in Figures 5c and 5e evidence separation of the FC and ZFC curves at higher temperatures than the Tf for iQC and ACs in Cd-Mg-RE (RE = Tb and Dy) systems. This behavior is also consistent with earlier reports in binary i-Cd-Dy/Tb [6] and ternary i-Cd-Mg-Tb [16] systems and is attributed to the intrinsic tendency of these compounds to have a distribution in freezing temperature [14] . In Figures 5e and 5g, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility of the 1/1 ACs in Cd-Mg-RE (RE = Dy and Ho) systems is shown. It does not exhibit spin-glass-like bifurcation of FC and ZFC but a conventional AFM ordering; one sharp anomaly at T N = 7 K in Cd75Mg10Ho15 and two anomalies at TN = 5 and 11 K in Cd75Mg10Dy15, are clearly seen in Figures 5e and 5g . The magnetic ordering in these compounds may originate from their lower Mg content (i.e. 10 at. %), compared to the rest of the alloys that contain 20-23 at% Mg (see Table 2 ). One may expect substantially less chemical disorder for the Cd/Mg mixed sites, and this less disorder may suppress the spin-glass freezing, resulting in the AFM ordering, as commonly found in the binary (chemically non-disordered) Cd6RE compounds [22, 23] . Such observation suggests chemical-disorder-driven AFM to spin-glass transition that presumably occurs as the Mg content of 1/1 ACs increases. A full discussion of them lies beyond the scope of the current study and will be dealt with in a separate article, which is under preparation [33] .",

The | w | values for iQC and ACs are approximately proportional to the de Gennes factor of the magnetic RE, which is in agreement with several earlier reports in other magnetic iQCs [18, 23, 26, 34] . On the other hand, the scaling for Tf is only approximate; serious deviation can be found for RE = Gd. This is most likely due to the difference in the single ion anisotropy; because of the vanishing orbital component, Gd 3+ is exceptionally isotropic among other RE ions in crystalline electric field, giving rise to the lower transition temperature. In addition to the de Gennes scaling, the Tf or TN values in Figures 7a and 7b show contrasting trends from iQC to 2/1 and further to the 1/1 ACs containing the same type RE element. Exemplified by RE = Tb, Tf is largest for 1/1 AC, while the smallest Tf is found for iQC. In striking contrast, the | w | values for iQCs are larger than those in 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, respectively suggesting that the total AFM interaction is increasing from 1/1 AC to 2/1 AC and further to the iQC. This indicates that the empirical | w / f | frustration parameter [34] , is the largest for iQC, and shows decreasing behavior as the quasiperiodicity is replaced by its rational approximation. The | w / f | yields 3 -8 times larger values for iQCs than ACs (see Table 2 ). The same conclusion can also be drawn by careful inspection of the magnetic parameters for the binary Cd-RE iQCs and 1/1 ACs, as summarized in Table 1 .",

Larger | w / f | values for iQCs than ACs may be interpreted as an evidence for higher competition of the magnetic interactions in aperiodic, rather than periodic systems. To obtain some insight into the difference in the competitions of interactions between iQC and ACs, we show the multiplicity of RE 3+ -RE 3+ distances and the distance dependence of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)type interaction in Figure 8 . For indirect RKKY-type interactions, the interaction strength oscillates with distance between the spins (r) and fades away in sufficiently longranged distances as (1/r) 3 [23, 31, 39] .

            "text": "The oscillatory behavior of the RKKY interaction leads to occurrence of competing FM and AFM interactions alternatively [31] . Based on the preliminary structure analysis [40] , the 1/1 and 2/1 AC unit cells contain 176 and 702 atoms, respectively. By assuming Cd and Mg to be divalent and RE elements to be trivalent (based on the obtained effective moments in Table 2 ), the number of free electrons within a unit cell is estimated to be 376 and 1482 in 1/1 and 2/1 ACs, respectively. Considering the lattice parameter of the 1/1 AC (resp. 2/1 AC) to be 1.54 (resp. 2.49 \u00c5), the Fermi wave vector kF is calculated to be 1.45 x 10 10 m -1 (resp. 1.44 x 10 10 m -1 ). Note that the afore-mentioned structure parameters of the 1/1 and 2/1 AC belong to, respectively, Cd-Mg-Y and Cd-Mg-Er Figure 8 plots variation of (2 F ij ) and distribution of RE 3+ spins as a function of interspin distance rij for 1/1 and 2/1 ACs up to 10 \u00c5. Note that each set of the symmetrically equivalent REs in the 2/1 AC, i.e. RE1 \u0336 RE5, as illustrated in Figure 2 , has distinct local environment and thus exhibits different distribution of RE-RE distances in Figures 8b-f . The bin width of \u03b4 = 0.07 \u00c5 is considered for plotting the histograms of nearest-neighbor distances. While multiple RE 3+ -RE 3+ distances exist in the 2/1 AC (Figure 8b-f ), quite few ones occur in the 1/1 AC ( Figure   Figure 8 . Comparison between the number of nearest-neighbour spins as a function of interspin distances for (a) 1/1 AC and (b-f) 2/1 AC. Interspin distance dependence of the RKKY interaction calculated for the 1/1 and 2/1 AC using f(x) = (\u2212x cos x + sin x)/x 4 where x = 2kFR is co-plotted in the same figure. R stands for RE-RE distances. Symmetrically distinct RE sites have different distributions of RE-RE distances, thus bearing distinct local environments. The occurrences of distances in different categories are indicated within a range of 3.4 to 6.2 \u00c5, for clarity. The results are based on the structure refinement models of the 1/1 AC (resp. 2/1 AC) in the Cd-Mg-Y (resp. Cd-Mg-Er) systems [40] . 8a). This larger variation of magnetic interactions in 2/1 AC may result in much pronounced competition for 2/1 AC. This explains the measured larger | w / f | values for the 2/1 AC in Table 2 compared to those obtained for 1/1 AC. Taking into account high structural resemblance between the iQC and 2/1 AC [12] , it may be reasonable to assume that the RE 3+ spin distribution and RKKY oscillation in the iQC would be similar to that of the 2/1 AC, presumably resulting in similar or even more pronounced competition of magnetic interactions in iQC. Note that similar approach using simplest free-electron model was already applied to explain composition-driven spin glass to ferromagnetic transition in the quasicrystal approximant in Au-Al-Gd system [39] . It should be mentioned that although Figure 8 captures an unevenness in the RE-RE pair distributions and thus evidences a more pronounced competition among FM and AFM exchanges in the 2/1 AC than 1/1 AC using the free-electron model, it is still deficient in depicting realistic RKKY oscillation regarding the sign of the J(r). This inconsistency requires more quantitative analysis, whereby it is necessary to go beyond the simplest free-electron model.",

This can be inferred from the observation that the long-range antiferromagnetic order in the 1/1 ACs with less Mg composition is replaced by the spinglass-like freezing by increasing Mg composition. One may also consider the orientational disorder of the central tetrahedron of the RTH clusters as another source of disorder contributing to the observed spin-glass-like behavior of the present samples. This kind of disorder was considered to be magnetically equivalent to the chemical disorder in iQC and AC in the ternary Au-Al-RE system [38, 41] , which are isostructural with those in Cd-RE system. Quite recently, the importance of the chemical disorder was also indicated directly by measuring crystalline-electric-field splitting in Au-Si-Tb 1/1 AC [42] . Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the combination of chemical disorder and competition between FM and AFM interactions due to oscillating RKKY polarization is responsible for the spin-glass-like feature in the present samples.",

The following conclusions are drawn from the present work: At higher temperatures (100 K < T < 300 K), all the iQCs and ACs follow Curie-Weiss law. The estimated \u03bceff are close to the calculated values for free RE 3+ . The w values are negative indicating that RE-RE exchange interactions are dominantly AFM. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, iQC and 2/1 ACs exhibit spin-glass-like anomalies for the RE atoms except Tm and Er. The 1/1 ACs exhibit either spin-glass-like freezing or AFM ordering depending on Mg content. The Tf values show increasing trend from iQC to 2/1 and 1/1 ACs. In contrast, | w | values for iQCs are larger than those for 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, indicating that the total AFM interactions between the neighbour spins are larger in aperiodic systems than periodic ones. The combination of chemical disorder and competition between FM and AFM interactions due to the oscillating RKKY polarization, is presumably responsible for the spinglass-like feature that is observed in most of the present compounds.",

The SEM analysis of the specified regions are shown on top right corner of the images. As seen, the analysed compositions are quite consistent with the nominal values. The atomic concentration of the magnetic Tb shows gradual increase from 11.97 at% in iQC to 14.35 at% in 1/1 AC. The corresponding EBSD Kikuchi patterns are displayed in Figures 3d-f. As shown, the iQC and 2/1 AC exhibit almost undistinguishable patterns with obvious pentagon-shaped Kikuchi bands, at the center of which the bands intersect at a unique point (marked as 5-fold [211111] and pseudo-5-fold [805] in iQC and 2/1 AC, respectively). This indicates high resemblance in atomic structures of the iQC and 2/1 AC. However, the Kikuchi pattern obtained from the 1/1 AC reveals split Kikuchi bands forming a distorted pentagonal band with pseudo-5-fold [503] pole at the center suggesting a significant deviation of the 1/1 AC structure from the iQC one. Figures 3g-i provide selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the iQC and ACs taken with incidences along their 3-fold axes.",
