Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation, probably induced by Th17, affects more severe asthmatic disease. Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by airway-targeting RNA viral infection; virus-derived double-stranded RNA, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 ligand, activates bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, including TSLP. Objective Because TSLPR-expressing DCs express TLR3, we examined how the relationship between TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation. Methods CD11c 1 DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in TLR ligands containing media with or without TSLP and then co-cultured with allogeneic na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells. Results CD11c 1 DCs responded to a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligand, poly(I : C), to upregulate expression of the functional TSLP receptor and TLR3. Although TSLP alone did not induce IL-23 production by DCs, poly(I : C) alone primed DCs for the production of IL-23, and a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed DCs for further production of IL-23. The addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP-activated DCs to prime na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to differentiate into Th17-cytokine-producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone. Conclusions These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote differentiation of Th17 cells with the central memory T cell phenotype under Th2polarizing conditions.",

TSLP activates DCs to strongly upregulate the expression of costimulatory molecules and to uniquely produce T helper (Th)2 cell-attracting chemokines, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) -but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, or TNF-a [3] . CD4 1 T cells are primed by TSLP-activated DCs to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells that produce the proallergic cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-a, while down-regulating IL-10 and IFN-g [3] [4] [5] . In addition, na\u00efve CD8 1 T cells are primed by TSLP-activated DCs to produce IL-5 and IL-13, but exhibit poor cytolytic activity [6] . Moreover, human TSLP is produced by bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, lung fibroblasts, and mast cells [1] [2] [3] . TSLP expression is increased in asthmatic airways and correlates with the expression of Th2-attracting chemokines and disease severity [7, 8] . These data suggest that TSLP is involved in the pathogenesis of human asthma [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

TGF-b, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-22, and IL-23 play critical roles in IL-17 production in human T cells [18] [19] [20] [21] , and the IL-23-IL-17 axis is involved in human psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, suggesting an important role for Th17 cytokines in chronic inflammatory diseases [17, 18, 22] . Although asthma is characterized by chronic dysregulated Th2 inflammation in the airways, recent human studies have shown that IL-17 is also expressed in the airways of patients with asthma, and IL-17 expression is increased in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, compared with patients with mild asthma and with normal controls [23] [24] [25] . Thus, Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th2 and Th1 cells with neutrophilic inflammation probably induced by Th17 cells affects more severe asthmatic disease [26] .

In addition, the addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLPactivated DCs to prime na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to differentiate into Th17-cytokineproducing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone.

Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we found that human CD11c 1 DCs cultured with medium alone expressed both TSLPR and IL-7Ra chain genes and that their expressions were enhanced by stimulation with TSLP and TLR3, 4, and 7/8 ligand agonist, poly(I : C), LPS, and LyoVec, respectively (Fig. 1a) . TSLP did not enhance LPS-or LyoVec-induced expression of TSLPR or IL-7Ra chain genes. However, TSLP significantly up-regulated poly(I : C)-induced expression of both TSLPR and IL-7Ra chain genes (Fig. 1a) . Moreover, although TSLP alone did not affect TLR3 gene expression, it significantly enhanced poly(I : C)-induced TLR3 gene expression in DCs (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, TSLP did not enhance gene expression of TLR4 and TLR8 induced by LPS or LyoVec. These data indicate that TSLP had a synergistic enhancing action only with the TLR3 ligand on expression of their own receptor genes.",

After 24 h of culture, TSLP-primed DCs produced high levels of TARC and MDC, while TSLP did not stimulate DC production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or TNF-a, demonstrating one of the unique properties of TSLP in DC activation (Fig. 2a , left panels) [3, 34] . In contrast, poly(I : C) alone and LPS alone primed DCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF-a (Fig. 2a , middle panels). TSLP did not affect poly(I : C)-or LPSinduced production of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, or TGF-b1, whereas TSLP marginally enhanced poly(I : C)-and LPSinduced increase in TNF-a production (Fig. 2a , middle panels and 2c). However, TSLP significantly up-regulated poly(I : C)-induced increase of IL-23 production (Fig. 2a , middle panels and 2b), which can induce CD4 1 T cell differentiation into Th17 cells in humans [18] [19] [20] . Although TLRLs alone did not produce large amounts of TARC or MDC in DCs, TSLP strongly induced production of the Th2-cell attracting chemokines, TARC and MDC, regardless of the presence of the TLRLs (Fig 2a, lower panels). Taken together, these data suggest that TSLP may maintain its unique ability in DC activation regardless of the presence of TLRLs.",

To examine whether TSLP retains this ability in the presence of TLRLs, we analysed the surface expression of CD80 on DCs by flow cytometry. Poly(I : C), LPS, LyoVec, and TSLP all stimulated surface CD80 expression in DCs (Fig. 2d) . Notably, TSLP enhanced surface CD80 expression in the presence of TLRLs to an extent similar to that of TSLP alone. Another trait of TSLP stimulation in DCs is enhancement of DC survival [3, 35] . After 24 h of culture, TSLP augmented the number of viable DCs induced by the TLRLs (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that TSLP maintains its unique abilities in DC activation regardless of the presence of TLRLs.",

In addition, we demonstrated in this study that TSLP1poly(I : C) stimulation resulted in unique activation of DCs (Fig. 2) . Subsequently, we examined how CD4 1 T cells expand and differentiate by DCs activated with TSLP1poly(I : C). CD11c 1 DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in poly(I : C)containing media with or without TSLP and then cocultured with allogeneic na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells at a 1 : 5 ratio of DCs: T cells. After 7 days of co-culture, CD4 1 T cells cocultured with TSLP1poly(I : C)-DCs expanded significantly more than those co-cultured with DCs activated with poly(I : C) alone, suggesting that TSLP1poly(I : C)-DCs have a stronger effect on CD4 1 T cell expansion than do poly(I : C)-DCs (Fig. 3a) .",

To examine the possibility that the direct action of TSLP on CD4 1 T cells is involved in differentiation of Th17 cells, purified na\u00efve CD4 1 CD45RA 1 T cells and memory CD4 1 CD45RA \u00c0 T cells were activated with Th17-cell differentiation media, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28 with neutralizing Abs for IL-4, and IFN-g with or without IL-6 and IL-23, in the presence or absence of TSLP. After 3 days of culture, cells were further expanded for 4 days with IL-2, and the production of IL-17 and IL-22 was measured in the culture supernatant using protein ELISA. TSLP had no effect on IL-17 or IL-22 production of na\u00efve CD4 1 CD45RA 1 T cells cultured even in Th17-cell differentiation media (Fig. 6) . However, TSLP significantly enhanced IL-17 and IL-22 production of memory CD4 1 CD45RA \u00c0 T cells in Th17cell differentiation media. These data suggest that in addition to indirectly priming na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells with a memory phenotype, TSLP may also directly act on these memory T cells to accelerate further expansion and production of IL-17.",

These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote Th17-cell differentiation under Th2-polarizing conditions. If Th2 cells predominate in driving inflammation in mild asthma, there is evidence that a more severe asthmatic phenotype is regulated through a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation probably induced by Th17 cells in the lungs [26] . TSLP-mediated Th17-cell commitment under Th2polarizing conditions may be involved in the development of an inflammatory mixture of Th2 and Th17 cells, a unique profile that resembles severe asthma.",

These T cell subsets can be further divided into subsets that are prone to produce Th1 or Th2 cytokines according to their differential expression of chemokine and tissue-homing receptors [40] [41] [42] , linking memory T cell subsets with a polarized Th1 or Th2 function. TSLP-DCs play important roles not only in Th2 priming but also in the maintenance and further polarization of Th2 central memory cells in allergic diseases [5] . In this study, we show that DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells to produce IL-17 and IL-22 and priming with TSLP1 poly(I : C)-DCs down-regulated CD45RA and up-regulated CD45RO in CD4 1 T cells, acquiring a CD45RA \u00c0 CD45RO 1 CD62L 1 CCR7 1 central memory T cell phenotype. Th17 cells are linked to the development of autoimmune diseases in vivo [16, 17] and the IL-23-IL-17 axis is involved in human psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, suggesting an important role for Th17 cytokines in chronic inflammatory diseases [17, 18, 22] .

However, enhanced DC cytokine production by TSLP and poly(I : C) stimulation were demonstrated only in IL-23 and not in IL-12 (Fig. 2a) . Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we found that priming of DCs with TSLP and poly(I : C) enhanced gene expression of IL-23p19 but not that of IL-12p40 and IL-12p35, another subunit of bioactive IL-12 (data not shown). These data suggest that increased expression of IL-23p19 but not IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 may enhance the production of IL-23 but not of IL-12 in DCs primed with TSLP and poly(I : C).",

These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote Th17-cell differentiation under Th2-polarizing conditions, implying that in allergic diseases, virus-derived double-stranded RNA and TSLP may play a role in Th17 lineage commitment, even under Th2-predominant polarizing conditions. 6 . TSLP directly acted on human memory CD4 1 T cells to enhance production of Th17 cytokines. Purified CD4 1 CD45RA 1 na\u00efve T cells and CD4 1 CD45RA \u00c0 memory T cells were cultured with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, anti-IL-4, and anti-IFN-g Abs in the presence or absence of IL-6 and IL-23 with or without TSLP. After 3 days of culture, cells were further cultured for 4 days with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2. Production of IL-17 and IL-22 was measured in the culture supernatant using protein ELISA. Closed bar and horizontal error bars indicate the mean and SD of three independent experiments, respectively.

CD11c 1 DCs cultured medium alone or activated with TSLP, poly(I : C), or the combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) were used to prime na\u00efve CD4 1 T cells for 7 days. For secondary culture, T cells primed by TSLP1poly(I : C)-DCs were subsequently stimulated for 3 days with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 mAbs, and IL-2. (a), Fold expansion of CD4 1 T cells cultured with indicated DCs compared with the initial T cell number. Viable T cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion of dead cells, and cell-surface marker phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. Closed bar and vertical error bars indicate the mean and SD of five independent experiments, respectively. Student's t-test for unpaired data was used to compare the values between two groups. \u00c3 Po0.05. (b), Cellsurface marker phenotypes of CD4 1 T cells before and after culture with indicated DCs. Cell-surface marker phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. Filled histograms represent staining of T cells with indicated markers; open histograms represent isotype controls. Data represent one of five experiments. (c), CCR4 expression of various CD4 1 T cells. Expression level of CCR4 mRNA was measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
