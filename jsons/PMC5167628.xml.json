            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and since then, it has resulted in increased incidence of human infection (Zaki et al., 2012, Chan et al., 2012, Rha et al., 2015). As of October 04, 2016, a total of 1806 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases, including 643 deaths (mortality rate ~36%), have been reported worldwide (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Bats are regarded as a natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and the potential mechanisms driving bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV are being investigated by comparing MERS-CoV with a closely related bat coronavirus, HKU-4 (Yang et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2013, Ithete et al., 2013, Cui et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014). Dromedary camels are shown to be an important intermediate host for MERS-CoV, and, as such, they are considered the key to stopping MERS-CoV transmission (Adney et al., 2014, Yusof et al., 2015, Gossner et al., 2016). The severe outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 demonstrated the ability of this virus to cause human-to-human transmission (Khan et al., 2015, Ki, 2015). The continuing spread of MERS-CoV and increase of MERS cases have highlighted the urgent need to develop effective and safe vaccines against MERS-CoV.",

It is cleaved during virus infection by host cell proteases into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 is responsible for MERS-CoV binding to host cells expressing viral receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Raj et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2013, Li, 2015). Meanwhile, S2 is engaged in fusion between virus and cell surface membranes, thus mediating the entry of MERS-CoV into target cells (Gao et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2014). These activities make MERS-CoV S protein, in particular its RBD, an important vaccine target (Zhang et al., 2014, Du et al., 2013b, Du et al., 2013a, Ma et al., 2014a, Ma et al., 2014b). A number of fragments have been identified as constituents of MERS-CoV RBD, but the fragment containing residues 377\u2013588 in the viral S protein is the critical neutralizing domain (CND) responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals (Ma et al., 2014a, Ma et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the RBD in its native trimeric form has never been evaluated for protective efficacy against MERS-CoV infection.",

For example, influenza virus hemagglutinins (HAs) with an Fd-formed trimerization domain have increased binding affinity to neutralizing antibodies targeting the stalk region of viral HAs (Krammer et al., 2012). In addition, recombinant HIV-1 trimeric envelope glycoproteins induced more efficient and broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies with increased potency than monomeric gp120 protein against divergent HIV-1 strains (Grundner et al., 2005). These reports reinforce the importance of mimicking native viral trimeric structures in the design of envelope glycoprotein-based subunit vaccines. However, imitating conformational structures of MERS-CoV S protein has never been attempted in MERS vaccine design.",

Evaluation of IgG1 and Ig2a subtypes further demonstrated that both Th1 (IgG2a) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses could be elicited by RBD-Fd and for at least the next six months, all maintained titers similar to, or higher than, those induced at 2 months post-immunization (Fig. 3C and D).

Although the challenged mice slightly reduced weight during day 8\u201314 after MERS-CoV challenge, they rapidly recovered to the normal weight (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the control mice with a background level of neutralizing antibodies in their sera kept continual reduction of the weight after virus challenge, and all mice (100%) died at day 11 (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Observation of pathological changes in the challenged mouse lungs revealed almost normal lung tissues in the RBD-Fd-immunized mice (Fig. 4Da). These lung tissues were similar to those of normal mice (Fig. 4Db), with only slightly thickened alveolar wall (Fig. 4Da). By comparison, the PBS control mice challenged with MERS-CoV had marked interstitial pneumonia, including inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar septal thickening, focal exudation, and hemorrhage (Fig. 4Dc). The hDPP4-Tg mice were immunized with RBD-Fd at 4 months old, boosted once 4 weeks later, challenged with MERS-CoV at 12 weeks post-boost, and survived for 3 weeks post-challenge before being sacrificed for evaluating pathological changes.

These results suggest that the trimeric MERS-CoV RBD maintains potent antigenicity, strong receptor-binding affinity, and high immunogenicity to induce robust antibody responses in the immunized animals. Particularly, RBD-Fd protein was able to induce long-term and highly potent neutralizing antibodies against infections of live and pseudotyped MERS-CoV of divergent strains isolated in the 2012\u20132015 outbreaks, possibly because RBD-Fd forms a trimeric structure to mimic the native conformation of the CND in MERS-CoV S protein, thus eliciting vigorous cross-neutralizing antibodies.",

Nevertheless, 83% of the survival rate and minimal pathological changes in the RBD-Fd-immunized hDPP4-Tg mice demonstrate its high protective efficacy against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. To further improve its protective immunity, RBD-trimer could be optimized by stabilizing its trimeric structure with disulfide bonds, adding other trimeric motifs, such as GCN4, adjusting linker sequences between the RBD and Fd, or combining these approaches, as reported for other viral proteins (Yang et al., 2000a, Yang et al., 2000b, Ringe et al., 2015). Since RBD-Fd only induced a background level of T cell responses (data not shown), its protective efficacy is largely associated with neutralizing antibodies. This is evidenced by that all of the mice survived from MERS-CoV infection had relatively high serum neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies, rather than cellular immune responses, may play a key role to prevent MERS-CoV infection in trimeric RBD-based subunit vaccines.",
