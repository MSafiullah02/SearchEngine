            "text": "Isolation, defined as separating sick individuals from healthy ones, is an integral public health measure for preventing transmission of infectious diseases (Ferguson et al., 2006, Aledort et al., 2007, Bell et al., 2006). Contact mixing patterns have been shown to be important in the spread of airborne pathogens (Edmunds et al., 2006, Edmunds et al., 1997, Melegaro et al., 2011, Wallinga et al., 1999, Mossong et al., 2008, Eames et al., 2010, Van Kerckhove et al., 2013). Few studies, however, have examined the effect of isolation on the spread of influenza to the social contacts of ill individuals (Aledort et al., 2007, Jefferson et al., 2011). One reason for the lack of research examining the impact of these measures, in particular, on influenza transmission is the difficulty in assessing whether individuals who are in contact with an index case are, in fact, protected by that individual's isolation (Ball and Neal, 2002, Germann et al., 2006). Indeed, such a study requires enumeration of a social network prior to any cases arising within the network and longitudinal collection of detailed information about the timing, duration, intensity, and setting of contacts between index cases and any members of their social network, after an individual's illness onset (Edmunds et al., 2006, Melegaro et al., 2011, Mossong et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2008). Furthermore, to test whether these measures reduce transmission of infectious disease within a social network, index cases must be randomized to engage in isolation as soon as they become ill. While the importance of social networks in the transmission of influenza has been increasingly recognized (Mossong et al., 2008, Cauchemez et al., 2011, Glass et al., 2006, Glass and Glass, 2008), experimental studies examining the effect of isolation or quarantine on transmission remain limited (Aledort et al., 2007, Jefferson et al., 2011).",

While chain referral (i.e., snowball sampling) and other similar approaches have been used successfully in a variety of infection transmission studies (Ding et al., 2005, Ghani and Garnett, 2000, Harris et al., 2006, Kendall et al., 2008, Gyarmathy et al., 2014), we additionally overlaid a randomized intervention onto a chain referral sample and employed multiple dynamic approaches for collecting data on social interactions among enrolled participants prospectively over time. Data collected in this study will be subsequently used to test the impact of isolation on transmission of influenza-like illness (ILI) \u2013 defined as cough plus fever/feverishness, or body aches, or chills \u2013 as well as laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory infections among the social network of cases in our study. While the intervention tested in this study was isolation, the methods used (i.e., a chain referral sampling and prospective collection of objective and self-reported data on face-to-face social interactions between enrolled individuals) are applicable for a wide range of potential studies aimed at exploring the relationship between social interactions, isolation, quarantine, and disease transmission. In addition, we describe a sub-study within the social network of study participants in which iEpi, a smartphone application, was used to collect objective sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on extensive social interactions between individuals enrolled in the study.",

To determine eligibility, the names of all individuals living in each of the six eligible residence halls, along with their house and room number, were included in a list provided by University Housing to study staff before participant recruitment began in September 2012. Study staff recruited individuals at informational tables and through a study website. Informational flyers about the study were also posted across campus. Students who signed-up to receive more information about the study (in-person, through the study website, or by phone or email) received an enrollment invitation email. Each enrollment invitation email contained a unique link to a web-based enrollment system that verified participant eligibility and provided an online consent form for participation. An electronic signature confirmed consent. Enrolled participants were asked to complete the enrollment survey and nominate social contacts living in one of the six eligible residence halls to join the study.

All participants were asked to report the following symptoms to study staff: cough, sneezing, runny nose, fever or feverishness, chills, or body aches. Participants reported symptoms via the weekly survey or by phone, email, or a web-based symptom reporting system. We defined ILI as a cough plus at least one of the following symptoms: fever or feverishness, chills, or body aches. This broad ILI definition, previously used in another recent influenza study in a college population (Aiello et al., 2010, Aiello et al., 2012), was used in order to capture influenza cases both with and without fever (Thursky et al., 2003). Participants meeting the case definition for ILI were surveyed about feelings of anxiety and were immediately offered time slots for scheduling a specimen collection appointment via the web-based survey system. Additionally, upon meeting the case definition for ILI, individuals who were randomized to the 3-Day isolation intervention group were instructed to immediately begin their isolation protocol and remain in their residence hall room for three days (i.e., 72 h from symptom onset). Control group participants were not asked to engage in isolation beyond their normal or preferred illness behavior and were given basic information about influenza transmission control methods (i.e., washing hands frequently and using a tissue to cover the nose and mouth while sneezing). In order to encourage adherence to the 3-Day isolation protocol, study staff were available to deliver to intervention group participants packages containing snacks, beverages, and sufficient provisions for the three-day isolation period. If requested, study staff assisted individuals participating in isolation with communications to faculty and employers about his or her illness and/or participation in the study including a doctor's note verifying illness and documenting participation in the study. Web-based surveys were sent to all ILI cases in both study groups 72 h after their reported symptom onset date and time. These ILI-related surveys collected data on the number of hours participants spent in their residence hall room, reasons participants left their residence hall room (e.g., to go to class or receive medical attention), and feelings of loneliness and anxiety experienced on the day of symptom onset and during the three subsequent days. At the end of the study period, regardless of whether they were an ILI case during the 10-week intervention period, students randomized to the 3-Day isolation group received an additional $50 for participation and students randomized to the control group received an additional $30 for participation in the study.",

While several other researchers have employed various technologies to perform automated contact tracing for examining disease spread (Eagle et al., 2009, Madan et al., 2010, Smieszek et al., 2014, Salathe et al., 2012, Stehl\u00e9 et al., 2011), to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this technology has been employed with an intervention specifically targeting the dynamic structure of the contact network. In order to maximize the likelihood of collecting data on the social interactions between participants who enrolled in the iEpi sub-study, we prioritized recruitment of participants into the sub-study who were most likely to interact with one another during the course of the intervention period. These participants were identified by constructing a network graph using information on nominations from our chain referral sample. We divided the resulting network into communities based on modularity (Newman, 2006) by using a recursive edge-deletion algorithm to determine community partitions (Girvan and Newman, 2002). Starting with the largest community, we randomly selected participants to receive an email invitation to participate in the iEpi sub-study. We continued to recruit participants within the communities, starting with the largest community, until we successfully enrolled the total number of participants in our pre-determined subsample population (N\n = 103). Students accepting the invitation to participate in the iEpi pilot study provided written informed consent and attended an iEpi training session.",

Bluetooth detection of one smartphone by another was used to estimate the likelihood that any two iEpi sub-study participant smartphones were within a few meters of each other during the course of the intervention period (Bluetooth detection typically operates on distances up to 5\u201310 m). Additionally, Bluetooth detection of other devices enabled in \u201cdiscoverable mode\u201d \u2013 including phones, tablets, and computers outside of the study \u2013 allowed us to estimate the overall level of social contact of iEpi sub-study participants with individuals outside the iEpi sub-study. The iEpi application also collected 3-axis accelerometer data to assess mobility, charging state, battery level (to identify loss of data due to battery failure), and battery temperature (to monitor fluctuations in temperature when transitioning between indoor and outdoor environments). Data were collected at five-minute intervals from January 28, 2013 to April 15, 2013.",

Participants received surveys only between 9:00 AM and 10:00 PM. If a participant did not respond to a survey within ninety minutes, the survey timed out and disappeared from the phone. Participants could opt out of sensor and survey data collection at any time by selecting the \u201cSNOOZE\u201d function on the iEpi application, which blocked data collection for up to twelve hours in half-hour increments. While no sensor data were recorded during this time, data was recorded in a way that differentiated between the initiation of the \u201cSNOOZE\u201d function and a turned-off or malfunctioning phone.

Of the 584 individuals who enrolled in the pilot study, 10 withdrew prior to the start of the intervention, resulting in 574 total participants. On the pilot study's exit survey, only 7.0% of respondents reported they would be willing to participate in isolation for four or more days in a future study. In addition, the highest level of adherence to isolation during illness was among those in the 3-Day isolation group (for the first four days post-ILI onset, cases from the 3-Day group spent an average of 72% of each day in their room, compared to 57% for the six-day group). These data were utilized to develop the main study design, which implemented a 3-Day isolation group versus a control group during the 2013 influenza season.

Thus, each assortativity was calculated for a reduced network containing only individuals who self-reported that characteristic. Additionally, when calculating assortativities, roommate links were removed from the network, as the purpose of assessing assortativity was to examine homophily within the chain referral process (i.e., whether individuals tended to nominate students with similar characteristics) as opposed to among roommates. To test for statistical significance of the assortativities, P-values, which can be interpreted as the probability of obtaining an assortativity as extreme as the observed assortativity under the null hypothesis of zero assortativity (i.e., no preferential connections between participants based on a given characteristic) were generated by bootstrapping using Python 2.7.",

These measures are based on the shortest path distances (i.e., the path with the fewest edges) between an individual and the other members in the network. An individual's closeness centrality is the reciprocal of the mean of all such shortest paths and represents the average number of edges away that a given individual is from any other individual (Beauchamp, 1965, Freeman, 1978). Betweenness centrality is as the mean proportion of shortest paths including a given individual (Anthonisse, 1971, Freeman, 1977) and represents the number of shortest paths connecting two individuals in the network that pass through a given individual. Estimating closeness and betweenness centralities requires a connected network (i.e., so that a path exists between every pair of individuals in the network).

Eighty-five percent of nomination links between participants were also reported as face-to-face contacts on at least one weekly survey, whereas only 29.8% of the edges in the Combined Weekly Network were previously captured in the Nomination network. The numbers of reciprocal (reported by both individuals) and non-reciprocal edges for each of the ten Week Networks are shown in Fig. 7\n; the mean percentage of each Week's edges that were reciprocal was 43.7 (SE: 0.8). Mean indegree, outdegree, and total degree in the Nomination Network were estimated by intervention group (see Supplementary Table S7) both for all nominated individuals and for enrolled participants, as well as by enrollment type for the enrolled participants (see Supplementary Table S8). There were no major differences by intervention groups for the three degree types (in-, out-, and total) within the Nomination Network for all nominated individuals or only enrolled participants. Within the subset of enrolled participants in the Nomination Network, nominees had higher in-, out-, and total degree than seed participants, though only differences for indegree and total degree were statistically significant (P\n < 0.001 for each). Cumulative distribution curves of in-, out-, and total degree for the Nomination Network are shown in Fig. 8\n. The distributions of all three measures (in-, out-, and total), were heavily right-skewed and over-dispersed, with the majority of individuals having two or fewer links. Consequently, the Nomination Network appears scale-free, with a log\u2013log plot and linear trendline (R\n2\n = 0.91) illustrating the approximately power\u2013law distribution for total degree, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.

Our successful use of chain referral sampling during participant recruitment allowed us to elucidate links within a social network of individuals at baseline and then follow this dynamic social network over time during the 2013 influenza season. The chain referral method of enrollment was particularly important in our study design; by enrolling students via their social connections, we increased the likelihood of a more complete social network during the study period. Most studies that include social contact information are egocentric (i.e., they only measure the number of immediate contacts for each individual, rather than capturing the connections between individuals). However, using an explicitly social network-based enrollment approach allowed us to gather longer chains of contacts between individuals. This approach will help to reveal transmission along a chain of contacts, or effects due to intersections of multiple transmission chain; fully capturing these dynamic transmission processes as they travel along the social network requires combining a chain referral-type approach with social contact measurements over time. Our study also highlights the importance of the nomination process in subsequent participation, as students who were nominated by more enrolled participants were more likely to enroll in the study than those who received fewer nominations. This perhaps indicates that students are more likely to participate in this type of study if more of their friends are also participating. Additionally, this likely resulted in participation by more socially connected students, which is particularly important for studies of infection transmission over social networks. Further, demographic data of undergraduate students living on-campus provided by University Housing shows that our study population was representative of the university population. Our study design is well-suited for examining the impact of not only isolation on preventing influenza transmission, but also modeling the impact of other measures, such as quarantine, that rely on collecting data among healthy contacts and following them over time to examine occurrence of illness and interactions over the period of exposure to illness onset. In addition, we introduced the use of a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected Bluetooth data on social contacts as well as contextually-dependent, contact-triggered survey data that will allow us to gain insights into interactions between participants in our study that may not be captured using traditional social network survey methodology. Future analyses comparing the self-reported social network to the Bluetooth network will shed light on the accuracy and reliability of self-reported contact data. The balance of study population characteristics observed at baseline across intervention groups \u2013 combined with prospective data collection of ILI symptoms, social interactions, and isolation behavior over a 10-week intervention period \u2013 will allow us to address numerous questions related to infection transmission dynamics. In addition, we will be able to provide valuable insights regarding the interplay between social network characteristics, behaviors, and perceptions of isolation among college-aged students.",

            "text": "Our study builds upon previous non-pharmaceutical intervention research conducted by our research team, in which we examined the use of surgical face masks and hand hygiene for prevention of influenza among college-aged students living in university residence halls, which typically involves one to three students sharing close living quarters (Aiello et al., 2010, Aiello et al., 2012). By conducting our study in university residence halls we were able to overcome several limitations facing studies of influenza transmission conducted in the household setting (Cowling et al., 2009, Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985, Viboud et al., 2004). First, it is logistically difficult to require symptomatic individuals within households to isolate themselves in separate living quarters in order to protect healthy family members. Second, even if it were possible to bar interaction in the household setting, the protective effects of isolation would not be easy to measure given the high rate of secondary transmission that occurs in the household setting (Cowling et al., 2009, Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985, Viboud et al., 2004). By contrast, a dorm setting allows more effective physical barring of interaction among the majority of social network members as well as classroom interactions (apart from shared bathroom facilities and possible roommate interactions during the intervention period). As an adjunct to our intervention, we provided and encouraged the donning of surgical masks when an intervention participant needed to visit the bathroom or leave their dorm room for any other reason. In addition, we provided guidelines on proper covering of coughs/sneezes and encouraged proper hand hygiene for the ILI cases and their roommates to reduce the potential for transmission when it was impossible to physically intervene on human interaction (i.e., sharing a dorm with roommates during the intervention). Third, we were able to explicitly gather extensive data on factors that are external to households but may also contribute to transmission, such as shared class schedules and participant interactions both within living quarters and within the wider university community. Overall, our study design and the physical environment of university residence halls allowed us to enumerate a much larger number of potential contacts and varying contexts where transmission may occur than one would generally observe in a household setting. That said, schools and particularly the residence hall setting are specialized environments and do not mirror the general population. However, our study setting does provide us with insights into larger networks that may be more representative of interactions that happen outside the household, in schools, and in other social settings (Ali et al., 2014, Newman and Girvan, 2004, Schafer, 2011, Zachary, 1977).",

This result again suggests successful randomization within the total population of eligible, nominated individuals as well as among those who enrolled in the study.

Among those who did participate during the intervention period, survey completion and active participation was high, with over eighty percent of participants completing over half of the weekly surveys. Additionally, the average number of contacts reported by individual participants per survey remained fairly consistent over the intervention period (mean: 3.6, SE: 0.06), thus we did not observe attrition in reporting of social interactions over the course of the study. As only one participant needed to report contact for the edge to be included in the Weekly social networks, we were able to capture contacts with students who were not actively participating, reducing the impact of missing data. However, close to half of all contacts reported on the weekly surveys were reciprocal (i.e., reported by both connected participants), allowing for additional verification of a given edge. Additionally, the increased participation requirements for ILI cases did not reduce engagement, as cases completed the same number of weekly surveys as non-cases. Similarly, intervention arm did not significantly affect participation among ILI cases, as demonstrated by the fact that 3-Day ILI cases had similar participation rates as control ILI cases. These results suggest that students did not find the weekly surveys, additional ILI surveys, specimen collection, and isolation to be overly onerous, and that it did not differ by intervention arm.",

            "text": "We observed moderate to high assortativity by residence hall and residence house among all nominated individuals, which is expected, as people who live close together may be more likely to nominate each other to join the study. Given that intervention groups were assigned by cluster, which were determined in large part by geographic boundaries within residence halls, it is also not surprising that we identified significant, moderate assortativity by intervention group for the Nomination Network. Within the reduced network of enrolled participants who provided self-report information, participants also tended to associate with those who shared sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, parental education, and employment, as well as those with similar health habits (i.e., smoking, drinking behavior, and risk for complications due to an influenza infection), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that health behaviors cluster within social networks and that individuals tend to have friends with similar demographic profiles (Barclay et al., 2013, Barnett et al., 2014). The iEpi sub-study participants were less likely to engage in drinking than non-participants, which may reflect the sampling method employed for selection into the iEpi sub-study, whereby individuals from a strongly inter-connected community were given priority for invitations to participate in the sub-study as highly connected individuals are likely to share health behaviors that were positively assortative in the Nomination Network. However, given the lack of statistically significant differences between iEpi sub-study and non-iEpi participants for other demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics, this result may simply be by chance, or may indicate that among those targeted to participate there was selection by nondrinkers.",

In terms of overall network structure, the average closeness and betweenness centralities for the largest component in the Nomination Network were both low, with small standard deviations, suggesting that most individuals were not strongly central to the network. The generally low betweenness centrality for most individuals implies that there were multiple shortest paths between most individuals, forming a more evenly dense network as opposed to a network wherein a small number of individuals act as \u201cbridges\u201d between more densely-connected clusters or clumps within the fully connected network. As such, it may difficult or impossible to identify individuals who are particularly influential in transmission across the network. The degree distribution for the overall Nomination Network and Combined Weekly Network were scale-free with a roughly power\u2013law degree distribution (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3), consistent with a wide range of previous social network studies (e.g., (Barab\u00e1si, 2009, Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999, Newman, 2001)). Scale-free degree distributions have been shown to facilitate rapid dispersal of information (or in this case, infection), across the network and to have connectivity that is robust to random node removals (Barab\u00e1si, 2009, Lusseau, 2003). We also observed positive clustering coefficients in both the Nomination and Week Networks, which is an additional measure of the degree of network clustering. Transitivities were higher in the Combined Week Network than in the Nomination Network. Clustered network structures such as these have been shown to facilitate rapid dispersal across the network in the first wave of an infection, although they may inhibit subsequent waves of infection (Kiss et al., 2006). As the majority of the Nomination Network was subsequently captured in the Combined Weekly Network, it appears that the students maintained their relationships from early in the school year as well as added new relationships. This overlap between the Nomination Network and Combined Weekly Network show that \u201cearly\u201d networks could potentially be used to preliminarily identify structures and individuals that might later facilitate or inhibit transmission during the influenza season. Further analyses on the dynamic social network captured during the study period will be discussed in future papers.",

The iEpi sub-study social network data was frequently sampled, as the iEpi phones collected data in five-minute intervals that can be used to verify and fill in gaps in the survey-based social network data collected in our study. We acknowledge, however, that the social network captured by surveys and iEpi data together represents only a fraction of the participants\u2019 full network of social contacts. This may be partially mitigated by examining the iEpi smartphone detection of Bluetooth devices outside of our study, which will allow us to approximate the overall number and frequency of social contacts iEpi sub-study participants had outside of the study.

For example, participants randomized to the 3-Day isolation intervention group who were unwilling to sequester themselves while ill may have chosen not to report their symptoms to study staff as often as control participants. However, ILI reporting bias was likely minimal based on our initial analyses in which we detected a similar incidence of ILI in both study groups (16.2% of intervention participants and 21.3% of control participants). In addition, participants were made aware of all study protocols to which they could be randomized prior to consent, which we anticipated would increase the likelihood that individuals who enrolled were willing to participate in either the 3-Day isolation intervention or control group. We also provided a wide range of services for those in the intervention group to facilitate compliance with isolation, including delivering snacks during their isolation period, such as doctors\u2019 notes to instructors or employers to excuse participants from classes or work, and assistance with obtaining class notes or proctoring of exams falling during intervention group participants\u2019 isolation period. In addition, each participant received a kit that included facemasks to be worn if they needed to leave their room during their isolation period, a thermometer for verifying fever, and hand sanitizer. Importantly, isolation was voluntary, as per the human consent process, and compensation was not compliance-dependent, therefore potential biases related to participants\u2019 self-reporting of intervention compliance were likely minimized.

            "text": "This study presented a number of challenges. The size of the study, as well as the setting, required extensive organizational efforts. For example, a large study staff had to be trained in recruitment, participant assistance (e.g., illness response, food delivery during isolation, and follow-up communication), online survey development, database creation and management, specimen collection, data cleaning and analysis. The complexity and amount of the collected data required a large amount of server space, as well as a programming specialist to create a system that could automatically make live updates, email and schedule specimen collection, identify and email contacts of ILI cases, and link data across the various surveys. Additionally, the iEpi sub-study required extensive mapping of on-campus routers, occasional debugging, data cleaning and verification. The study population and setting also added to the logistical challenges of the study. Study staff needed access to the residence halls for recruitment and specimen collection, which required cooperation with multiple university offices (Housing and Security). Data cleaning was extensive, particularly coding any open ended survey responses, filling in class schedule responses, and deciphering the large amount of iEpi data to ensure the smartphones were collecting data accurately and consistently (e.g., using the correct timestamps and locations). The overall success of the recruitment, survey, and intervention methods leads us to conclude that if we were to later run a similar study, we would be able to use this study protocol without making substantive changes. To the best of our knowledge, the information in this study represents the most comprehensive longitudinal data collected in a social network study of respiratory infection transmission to date. Participant feedback on the eX-FLU study was also largely positive. The monetary incentive provided was successful in motivating participants to join the study, with 95.2% of those who completed the exit survey (N\n = 295) reporting the cash incentive as a reason for joining the study. In addition, 96.5% (N\n = 278) of participants who responded to the exit survey reported they would be willing to participate in a similar study in the future. These findings suggest that the methodology used is practical for future studies and the monetary incentive was sufficient to promote participant enrollment. Moreover, given the wide array of self-reported and objective data collected in this study, we will be able to address numerous questions related to social network interactions, behaviors, and infection transmission in future work. For example, analyses of the data derived from this study may provide insights on how health behaviors such as hand hygiene are transmitted along social networks and how these behaviors may be modified by illness status. These data may also allow us to conduct analyses to assess what role an individual's position in the social network may play in their health behaviors. In addition, data on different types of viral and bacterial pathogens, viral shedding, bacterial colonization, and transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens to healthy contacts will help elucidate the occurrence, transmission, and co-infection of specific types of viruses and bacteria over time, and to generate transmission trees (Ypma et al., 2012). Furthermore, our assessment of bacterial colonization using specimens collected from healthy contacts in our study will allow us to fill gaps in the literature regarding colonization in young adults who reside in community settings, as most previous studies have focused on very young populations (Rodrigues et al., 2013, S\u00e1-Le\u00e3o et al., 2008), elderly populations (Videcnik Zorman et al., 2013), or individuals in health care centers (Peleg and Hooper, 2010). Moreover, while this study had a specific focus on the effects of isolation, the underlying network data can be used to develop simulation models of social network dynamics among college students, to address a range of other questions. For example, one might examine via simulation the effects of quarantine (the restriction of movement of individuals whom have been exposed to an infectious illness without signs of illness) rather than isolation. In general, there is a need for more work on examining the effects of behavior (for both susceptible and infected individuals) in mathematical epidemiology (Funk et al., 2010, Funk et al., 2015, Phua and Lee, 2005, Hayashi and Eisenberg, 2016) This study will provide a new resource for these efforts building on egocentric data on social mixing patterns that have been used in previous work (Mossong et al., 2008, Potter et al., 2011, Hens et al., 2009, Fu, 2005, Mikolajczyk and Kretzschmar, 2008).",

The data obtained from this study, including the use of novel cell phone technologies for examining human interactions and behaviors, present an unprecedented opportunity to test and assess various aspects of infection transmission, as well as clustering and transmission of socio-behavioral characteristics, viral shedding over time, and interventions targeted within social networks. Further analyses will provide key insights regarding the impact of isolation on the prevention of influenza transmission as well as many other respiratory viruses that share similar transmission pathways. Finally, we plan to provide these data in an open access format in the future to allow other researchers to utilize them for mathematical modeling applications and continued study of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing the transmission of infectious diseases in the community setting. Currently, the data is identifiable and requires several steps to provide de-identified data. We plan to work with interested investigators on a case by case basis to help them with accessing the data after de-identification so that our provision of data meets our ethics requirements for the study confidentiality.",
