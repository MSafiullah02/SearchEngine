The original deadline of June 2020 is currently delayed due to global responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, but an agreement is expected to be reached once normal activities resume. This has raised some concerns regarding the ability to support fishing sectors, but an effective agreement should be viewed as a proactive policy allowing for carefully designed transitions that, per the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, leave no one behind. Sustainable and equitable fisheries are essential for enabling additional SDGs including reducing poverty (SDG 1), providing nutritious food (SDG 2), and securing livelihoods (SDG 8) [2], and failure to achieve an agreement would reduce confidence in our ability to advance the UN Sustainable Development Agenda. There are still important gaps in reaching consensus on a comprehensive and just agreement within the World Trade Organization (WTO) mandate [3], but negotiators are actively engaged in discussions and need more attention from governments, fisher organizations, and civil society. The following aims to inform negotiations towards an effective agreement by providing evidence-based options for reform that highlight equity needs while reducing environmental harm [4].",

Overcapacity (the existence of more fishing power than needed to take the maximum sustainable yield) leads to overfishing where management is lacking and to economic waste in any case. This lost potential value due to overcapacity is estimated at ~ US$83 billion per year [8], and declines in fish stocks can cause collapses and cascading effects on ecosystems and economies that are difficult to recover from (e.g., Atlantic cod in North America). This issue is critical for regions that depend on seafood to reduce chronic malnourishment [9,10] (e.g., Africa's nutrition action plan to build \u2018grey matter infrastructure\u2019). Subsidization of illegal fishing activity is especially worrisome given documented linkages with illicit trade and organized crime [11,12] and can also create conflicts with legal fishers who see little benefit in abiding by the rules [13].",

The top-five subsidizing nations provide four times as much as the lower-income nations of the world combined [7]. In the Indian Ocean, the proportion of tuna catch that is subsidized by different countries ranges from 10% to over 100%, yet quota allocations are based on historical catch [15]. Most large-scale fishing effort within the waters of developing coastal states is by distant-water fleets [16], which may not share an interest in conserving local ecosystems and can negatively impact local communities that lack capacity to access these fish or enforce their boundaries. Over half of high seas fishing grounds would not be profitable without subsidies [17] and reducing capacity-enhancing subsidies could bolster food security and employment in coastal fisheries and level the playing field within seafood markets and trade [3,18].",
