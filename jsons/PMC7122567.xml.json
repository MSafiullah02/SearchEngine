The health system now has been widely expanded in the country. Until two decades ago, infectious diseases (mainly water and airborne diseases including rabies, tetanus, and others) were the common cause of morbidity and mortality in Nepal. About 70% of all health problems and cause of death was associated with infectious diseases [6, 7]. Many children were dying due to easily preventable communicable diseases primarily diarrhea and/or dysentery, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and other respiratory infections. Until two decades ago, intestinal parasitic infection in some communities was very high (over 70%) and multi-parasitic infection was common [8\u201311]. Among the soil-transmitted helminth infection, Ascaris lumbricoides infection alone was over 75% in some communities with a mean annual prevalence of 35% among patients visiting a teaching hospital in capital city, Kathmandu [10\u201312]. Over one-third of soil samples tested revealed helminth parasites eggs [13].\n",

It is common mainly in communities with poor environmental sanitation leading to the contamination of drinking water and poor hygienic condition [23]. Enteric fever is seen to affect young population. However, year to year numbers of enteric fever cases have been seen slightly decreasing as recorded at one of the tertiary level hospitals in Kathmandu Valley but yet causing a considerable burden (S. enterica serovars Typhi: 68.5% and S. enterica serovars Paratyphi A 31.5%) [29]. The decrease in the number of enteric fever cases during recent years appears to be attributed to the improvement of sanitary and hygienic condition even in the rural areas primarily because of open defecation free campaign [22]. Outbreaks occur occasionally and some of times due to multidrug-resistant organism spread from a single point source [30] (Fig. 1).\n",

In the year 2000/01, over 31,000 TB patients were registered and treated under the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), of which 13,000 were new smear positive [37]. The TB control program has achieved its goal in controlling TB significantly primarily due to effective case detection and treatment by DOTS (introduced in 1996) (with success rates of 85% or greater). However, TB remains as one of the major public health problems in Nepal and considered to be disease of poverty (malnutrition). According to Annual Report 2014, a total of 37,025 cases of TB were registered in 2014 out of which 51.0% were pulmonary TB mostly in people aged 15\u201324 years [38]. According to report, TB-HIV co-infection rate in Nepal is 2.4% (HIV among TB) and 11.6% (TB among HIV) based on the sentinel survey, 2011/12 and the TB program has saved 31,187 lives in 2014 nationally, but still 1049 deaths were reported among general TB cases [38]. However, there is big challenge of multidrug-resistant TB. Currently, 45% of total population is infected with TB, 40,000 people are infected with TB every year; 20,000 new sputum positive cases every year and 5000\u20137000 people die each year from TB [39].",

Accordingly, none of the hospitals studied had an infection control team (ICT). Common HAI causing bacteria in Nepal includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., and others. Most of these HAI bacterial isolates are MDR. These bacteria are mainly associated with urinary tract infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, surgical site and implant-associated infection, catheter site infection, and soft tissue infections. This is primarily due to high microbial (bacteria and fungi) burden in hospital environment and high pathogen career rate among staffs (hands: 59.2% and nose: 73.7%) mainly S. aureus and most of them were highly drug resistant) [88].",

The cases of ocular and/or neurocysticercosis are on the rise and thought to be due to the availability of diagnostic facilities (particularly the CT and MRI) during recent years. As reviewed by Rai, there are sporadic reports on other zoonotic parasites [89].

Many outbreaks occurred in the year 2013. This resulted into great loss in economy particularly to poultry farmers and farm associated business (egg, meat, and feed business). As a result, government provided compensation to the poultry farmers and businesses concerned for the loss of chicks, eggs, bird feed, and chicken due to the spread of bird flu at six different places. To control H5N1, special plan, program and activities were launched and Nepal has been declared free of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in May 2014 [108].

Due to the indiscriminate and prolonged use of antibiotics in meat animals, high level of antibiotic residues has been found in the marketed meat and consumable broiler chicken liver, in particular, showed very high percentage of antibiotic residue [128].

Moreover, more than 52% of the diarrheal cases are being treated by Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), the interface between healthcare facility and community. This may be the reason that spread and outbreak of various infectious diseases predicted after the earthquake 2015 did not occur. Infectious diseases are common in villages, but town and cities are not completely free of infectious diseases. Interestingly, some of the outbreaks of infectious diseases are occurring only in the town and cities. However, the overall prevalence of infectious diseases has come down. However, unusually heavy rainfall, floods, and landslide are creating good environment for the spread of infectious diseases.",
