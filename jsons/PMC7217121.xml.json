Their study, the largest cohort of COVID ECMO patients to date, describes 32 patients who were provided extracorporeal support either with veno-venous (VV), veno-arterial-venous (VAV), or veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. This initial description provides some insights into the use of ECMO for COVID-19 disease. Notably, the authors provide a glimpse at the median duration of ECMO in the five patients successfully weaned from ECMO (8 days, IQR = 6\u201310), in addition to spending several days in endotracheally intubated before initiation of ECMO (median = 4 days, IQR = 2\u20135). Further, there is a trend toward higher mortality in those patients who require VA-ECMO or VAV-ECMO, in contrast to those patients who only require VV-ECMO, which could potentially be explained by the concomitant cardiac component of their COVID-19 disease, as well as the likely low-flow state and end-organ hypoperfusion before initiating VA-ECMO.",
