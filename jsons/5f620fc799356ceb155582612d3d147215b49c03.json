These two classes of proteolytic enzymes share an acyl transfer mechanism of the peptide bond cleavage involving the nucleophilic attack of the active site serine hydroxyl and cysteine thiolate nucleophile, respectively, at the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond (Fig. 1) . Specificity of proteases is generally achieved through defined interactions of amino acid residues and certain subsites at the active site. The small size of fluorescent coumarins suggests their incorporation into the side chain of amino acids and the generation of fluorescent peptides. Internally quenched fluorescent (IQF) peptide substrates make use of this option. They consist of a fluorophore, e.g. a coumarin, and a quencher moiety, separated by several amino acids. Proteolytic cleavage of any peptide bond within this portion leads to a loss of quenching and the concomitant generation of fluorescence. Such IQF peptides have frequently been employed for the positional profiling of protease substrates to perform an active-site mapping and to elucidate substrate specificity [9] . covering P2 to P3\u00b4 residues and the corresponding subsites comprising S2 to S3\u00b4 in the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [12] .",

In contrast, the serine proteases favor harder electrophiles like phosphonates or isocoumarins [13] . Next to the warhead, ABPs contain two further parts, a spacer and a tag (Fig. 2) . The highest impact on the specificity of an ABP is caused by the spacer, which can consist of a well-accepted peptidic recognition unit. The tag permits the detection of the inhibited protease, either through biotin or fluorescent reporters, among which cyanines, fluoresceins, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives and coumarins have been frequently employed [14] . The introduction of the latter fluorophore into ABPs for serine and cysteine proteases will be considered in this review.

Preventing this twisting process increases the quantum yield and restores fluorescence in aqueous media, as can be achieved through rigidization of the amino group in one or two rings [11, 26] . In coumarin 343 (8) , longer wavelengths of excitation (440 nm) and emission (480 nm, in aqueous solution) appear [27] . The extension of the \u03c0-electron system due to coupling in position 3 with a heteroaryl substituent and sulfonation at position 6 resulted in a bathochromic shift, high quantum yield and good water solubility of the resulting dye 9 with an absorption maximum of 426 nm and an emission maximum of 481 nm (in aqueous solution) [10] . The incorporation of coumarin moieties into the side chain of amino acids has frequently been carried out and utilized for the assembly of fluorescent probes.

Factor Xa acts in the clotting cascade by converting prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of phospholipids and calcium. Factor Xa is a connecting link between internal and external ways of coagulation. Factor Xa inhibition has become a particular successful strategy in the development of new anticoagulants. Thrombin represents the terminal serine protease of the blood clotting cascade. It acts as a stimulator of platelet activation and as the direct converter of the glycoprotein fibrinogen to fibrin. Thrombin amplifies its own generation by feedback activation of factors V, VII and IX. Moreover, thrombin also activates factor XIII by cleaving an activation peptide segment. The resultant transglutaminase introduces the covalent crosslinks into the fibrin clot [46] . Compound 15 show a pronounced inhibition of chymotrypsin [47] , rather than of thrombin and factor Xa. Coumarin 16 exhibited a secondorder rate constant of thrombin inactivation of 37,007 M -1 s -1 . Activity against chymotrypsin was reduced in the order 15 to 17, and the latter compound was more potent against thrombin (k i /K i = 3,457 M -1 s -1 ) than against chymotrypsin [45] .

In a peptide sequence, for example with four amino acids P1-P4, one position is fixed with a known amino acid, while the others contain an equimolar or isokinetic mixture of natural amino acids. The expansion by unnatural amino acids led to hybrid combinatorial substrate libraries (HyCoSuLs) [56, 57] . In a fluorogenic PS-SCL, the C-terminal P1 amino acid is coupled to a fluorophore, which is buried in the S1\u00b4 pocket. Protease-catalyzed cleavage of the amide bond between the P1 amino acid and the dye results in time-dependent increase in fluorescence, amenable to kinetic measurements. By means of this technique, it is possible to study the impact of the known amino acid at the desired position independent of the other ones. Thus, PS-SCLs provide information on the particularly preferred amino acid residues at the corresponding positions and allow for the deconvolution to obtain an optimal peptide sequence. The resulting substrates can be characterized by the specificity constant k cat /K m with high values corresponding to suitable substrates. As a matter of course, such an active site mapping is limited to the non-primed positions [56, 58] .",

The Matriptase, one of the best characterized TTSPs and a close relative of matriptase-2, is mainly expressed in epidermis, salivary gland, thyroid, stomach, kidney, prostate and ovaries as an inactive zymogen and has to be converted in an autocatalytic manner into its active form. Matriptase processes several proteins, such as hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, uPA and protease-activated receptor 2 which play critical roles in tumorigenesis and trigger other signaling pathways related to cancer proliferation and metastasis [124] . An ABP for matriptase (21, Fig. 15 ) also included the diphenyl phosphonate warhead and two arginine mimetics expected to occupy the S1 and S2 subunits. The coumarin fluorophore was assumed to be orientated towards the S3/S4 region.

AMC coupled to the C-terminus of the substrate does not allow evaluation of substrate specificity for amino acids in position P1, because the side chain of a specifically functionalized amino acid P1 has to be fixed at the solid phase. This limitation was circumvented by the implementation of an altered solid-phase synthesis technique, employing an alkanesulfonamide \"safety-catch\" linker as follows. The a haloacetonitrile forms a highly reactive N,Ncyanomethylacylsulfonamide which undergoes regioselective nucleophilic attack of the amino group of the P1 amino acid amide possessing AMC releasing the final coumarinyl substrate.",

Since the physiological role of FSAP is not fully understood and the significance of certain substrate cleavages has been questioned, knowledge of its substrate specificity and defined peptide substrates to specifically measure FSAP activity in the plasma are required.Kara et al.  performed an FSAP substrate mapping using a diverse PS-SCL of AMCtetrapeptides. The assays were monitored fluorimetrically with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. The preferred P4-P1 sequence was Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg and the corresponding fluorogenic substrate Ac-Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg-AMC exhibited a k cat /K m value of 26,300 M -1 s -1 and a high selectivity for FSAP compared to thrombin, plasmin, FXa, uPA, tPA, FXIIa. After addition of histones to plasma, turnover of this substrate was accelerated, reflecting the histone-mediated activation of pro-FSAP[64].Rut  et al. obtained a synthetic FSAP substrate by means of a HyCoSuL with arginine fixed in P1 position and 19 natural and 108 unnatural amino acids in P2-P4 position. ACC was used as fluorophore [66]. Excitation was conducted at 320 nm and the emission was measured at 460 nm. The best identified substrate, Ac-Pro-D-Tyr-Lys-Arg-ACC, showed k cat /K m values of 55,045 M -1 s -1 and 17,833 M -1 s -1 for the protease domain (amino acids 292-560) of wild-type FSAP and plasma FSAP, respectively (Fig. 7). Based on these outcomes, a biotin and a cyanine-5 (Cy5) containing ABPs were designed. For this purpose, the coumarin moiety was exchanged for a diphenyl phosphonate whereby the electrophilic phosphorous atom, in place of the carbonyl carbon, forms a covalent bond to the \uf061-carbon of the P1 arginine. The probe was assembled through the introduction of the linker-connected biotin or Cy5 substructure at the N-terminus of the peptide. A nucleophilic attack of the active-site serine at the warhead's phosphorous leads to irreversible inhibition and labeling of the target protease [66]. This prototypical stepwise approach towards an ABP starting from the identification of a preferred amino acid sequence has frequently been demonstrated. Examples include ABPs for cathepsin G [67-69], human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and proteinase-3 [70], the major secreted serine proteases of neutrophils and mast cells. Exemplary illustration of a protease-catalyzed cleavage of an ACC-based peptidic substrate. Ac-Pro-D-Tyr-Lys-Arg-ACC was identified by employing a PS-SCL [66]. Matriptase-2 (MT-2), a member of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), is mainly expressed in the liver. It shares the primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids in P1 position with FSAP and other trypsin-like serine proteases. MT-2 cleaves membrane-bound hemojuvelin, the co-receptor of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor, resulting in a decreased activation of the SMAD signaling cascade and in a reduced expression of the hepcidin gene. Hepcidin, through interaction with ferroportin, acts as a regulator of the intestinal iron absorption. Accordingly, high activity of MT-2 results in increased iron uptake and MT-2 was considered as a target for the treatment of iron overload diseases and \uf062-thalassemia [71,72]. ACC-containing peptides were used to elucidate the substrate specificity of MT-2 with respect to the P4-P1 positions. Deconvolution of the applied library provided Ile-Arg-Ala-Arg to comprise the sequence best accepted by MT-2 [73]. By dint of this outcome, the substrate specificity for the positions P1\u00b4-P3\u00b4 was evaluated. By using PS-SCL, IQF heptapeptides were designed, in which positions P1-P4 were occupied by the before determined sequence. N-terminal 2-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and C-terminal 3nitrotyrosine were introduced as fluorescence donor and acceptor, respectively. After excitation at 320 nm, cleavage of the substrate after the P1 arginine (underlined) resulted in a rise of fluorescence at 450 nm, because of the henceforward absence of quenching. The best specificity was observed for Abz-Ile-Arg-Ala-Arg-Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr(3-NO 2 )-NH 2 with a k cat /K m value of 454,200 M -1 s -1 [73]. B\u00e9liveau et al. incorporated the filaggrin-derived organs and occurs as membrane-associated or secreted enzyme. It cleaves and inactivates the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Incretins constitute metabolic hormones that stimulate, in the presence of high glucose levels, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells and inhibit the release of glucagon, leading to a downregulation of blood glucose concentration. Accordingly, DPP4 plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, and DPP4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, are used in the treatment of type-II diabetes mellitus [75]. DPP4 cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with a proline residue at the penultimate, i.e. P1, position. In order to identify new DPP-4 inhibitors, a suitable sensitive assay for a high-throughput screening is required. A commonly applied principle makes use of fluorescent coumarinyl dipeptides with a free amino group, e.g. H-Gly-Pro-AMC [76]. Kawaguchi et al. discussed disadvantages of such substrates, such as the excitation by a short wavelength and the short fluorescence life-time.Since the material of microplates scatters short wavelength light, undesirable interferences may occur. To overcome these limitations, a time-resolved fluorescence probe containing an aza-coumarin was developed(Fig. 8). The probe contains a lanthanide and is characterized by a large Stokes shift and a long luminescence lifetime, so the short background signals are negligible, resulting in an increased sensitivity for HTS. The substrate's strong luminescence is decreased after cleavage through acceptor-excited photo-induced electron transfer (PeT).",

LonA features an AAA domain and a proteolytic domain. The AAA domain forms oligomeric ring structures, and substrates are led through this pore into a separate chamber, where they are consumed by the proteolytic domain. Lon proteases are responsible for the degradation of more than 50% of the bacterial misfolded proteins. Even some sequences of cleavage sites are known, the modality of substrate recruitment is not well understood[79]. Because the Lon proteases play important roles in biofilm formation and stress tolerance, and inhibitors reduce colonization and virulence, Lon protease is a promising target for new antibiotics. Lon proteases are serine proteases but possess a serine-lysine dyad, in contrast to most serine proteases with a catalytic triad[80].The majority of Lon-protease inhibitors exhibits no selectivity and interacts with a huge number of serine proteases. Babin et al. introduced a well-tolerated substrate with high selectivity for Lon protease by using a HyCoSuL. Deconvolution led to the substrate Ac-hArg-nptGly-Phe-ACC with a k cat /K m value of 25,000 M -1 s -1 . Neopentylglycine on P2 and homoarginine in P3 position resulted in selectivity over other serine proteases. The collected data were used for the assembly of an irreversible inhibitor. A boronic acid was inserted as a warhead, forming a covalent bond with active-site serine, and pyrazine-2-carbonyl as capping group at the N-terminus to create a Pyz-hArg-nptGly-Leu-B(OH 2 ) [81]. (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), possess a serine protease referred to as NS2B-NS3.The protein NS2B is integrated in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. NS2B contains a hydrophilic part, essential for the non-covalent interaction with the serine protease NS3. Together they form the complex NS2B-NS3, which plays a crucial role in virus replication. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins by host proteases and NS2B-NS3 itself[82,83]. NS2B-NS3 gets more and more in the focus as a promising drug target. By means of an ACC-basedHyCoSuL, Rut et al. evaluated the substrate specificity of the P1-P4 positions with 19 natural and 108 unnatural amino acids for the positions P2-P4 and with 139 natural and unnatural amino acids for the P1 position. The best accepted substrates were Ac-D-Arg-Lys-Orn-Arg-ACC with a k cat /K m value of 1,104,000 M -1 s -1 for ZIKV NS2B-NS3 and Ac-D-Lys-Lys-Orn-Arg-ACC with a k cat /K m value of 65,300 M -1 s -1 for WNV NS2B-NS3. By considering these mapping approaches as well as selectivity requirements, ABPs for flaviviral proteases havebeen developed which share the characteristic dibasic recognition motif(Fig. 9). Probe 18 was selective for the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease, and 19 had a gradual activity for the proteases from ZIKV, WNF and DENV2[84].",

Typically stored in the acid environment of the lysosome, their primary function is the nonspecific degradation of lysosomal proteins from endocytosis[85-  87].Cathepsin B is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, synthesized as a 339-amino acid preproenzyme. Its signal peptide guides the protein to the rough endoplasmatic reticulum, where the short sequence is removed forming procathepsin B. The mature enzyme is generated through autocatalytic activation. The protease features endopeptidase and dipeptidyl J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f carboxypeptidase activity, depending on the translocation of the occluding loop to form an open and closed conformation, respectively. Cathepsin B has been identified as an important tumor-promoting factor. In several cancer types, the enzyme is overexpressed and responsible for the activation of other proteases and the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM), either by extracellular proteolysis catalyzed by the secreted enzyme or after internalization of ECM components, leading to tumor migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.Cytosolic cathepsin B plays a role in cell death by promoting apoptosis, triggered by the activation of caspases 3 and 9[58,86,88]. Since cathepsin B expression is elevated in cancer cells, its proteolytic activity can be addressed for prodrug activation and drug delivery[89,90]. Such approaches can make use of coumarin fluorescence. For example, a prodrug system was designed with a dipeptide trigger and a coumarin linker. After proteolytic cleavage, a disassembling cascade was initiated resulting in the release of the anti-cancer drug melphalan and the emergence of the coumarin fluorescence[91].The 333-amino acid pre-proenzyme of cathepsin L traverses a similar way to activation as cathepsin B, and its active form is obtained by autocatalytic cleavage or through the aspartyl protease cathepsin D. Cathepsin L has a strong tumor-promoting function.Besides cathepsin B, it is expressed at high levels in tumors and expression of both enzymes serves as a valuable biomarker. Cathepsin L is involved in endolysosomal and autophagic degradation pathways and plays a role in the accruement of liver fibrosis as well as polycystic and proteinuric kidney diseases, the latter through the cleavage of dynamin. Cathepsin L was reported to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and to contribute to cardiac repair. Under uncontrolled diabetic conditions, a reduced cathepsin L activity impairs the invasion of circulating endothelial progenitor cells[85,88,92].While the pre-proenzyme of cathepsin S exhibits 331 amino acids, the mature protein consists out of 217. Contrary to other cathepsins, it is expressed in antigen-presenting cells, localized in lymph and spleen, as well as other immune cells. Cathepsin S is the main processing enzyme of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated invariant chain, displaying a pivotal role in MHC II-dependent antigen presentation. Hence, the endolysosomal activity is crucial for regulating the immune response by B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages and connects cathepsin B to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis and psoriasis.",

Ac-His-Arg-Leu-Arg-ACC (for cathepsin B), Ac-His-Arg-Tyr-Arg-ACC (for cathepsin L) and Ac-Leu-Arg-ACC (for cathepsin K) showed specificity constants (k cat /K m ) of 15,000 M -1 s -1 , 1,900,000 M -1 s -1 and 340,000 M -1 s -1 , respectively[94]. Substrate profiling of cathepsin B by means of a HyCoSuL identified an N-terminal acetylated ACC peptide with cyclohexylalanine (P4), leucine (P3), glutamic acid benzyl ester (P2) and arginine (P1) to be highly selective over related cathepsins and to exhibit a specificity constants of 3,100,000 M -1 s -1[95]. Accordingly, the substrate specificity of cathepsin L was dissected, leading to themost selective peptide with histidine (P4), D-threonine (P3), pentafluorophenylalanine (P2) and arginine (P1) characterized by a k cat /K m value of 729,200 M -1 s -1 [96]. Subsequently, Poreba et al. designed activity-based probes for cathepsin B and L quipped with an acyloxymethyl ketone warhead and a cyanine-5 fluorophore [95,96]. 7-Amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC, 6, see Fig. 3), when released from the peptide substrates possesses a red-shift of excitation and emission, an advantageous feature for monitoring protease activity, compared to AMC and ACC. Dipeptidyl peptidase-1(DPP1), also referred to as cathepsin C, is expressed in most mammalian tissues and reported to catalytically activate several leukocyte-derived serine proteases. DPP1 is thought to play a role in acute experimental arthritis. DPP1 cleaves dipeptides from the N-termini of substrates.Accordingly, AFC was placed at the C-terminus of an appropriate dipeptide, Gly-Phe, with a free amino group. Enzyme activity was followed at 400 nm (excitation) and 492 nm component probes have been reported for cathepsin B and L that produce in the cleavage step a two-component leaving group which undergoes spontaneous immolation to generate the fluorescent reporter AMC[98,99].The SARS-Cov-2 virus out of the Coronaviridae family emerged first in the Chinese province Hubei in December 2019 and has since then spread around the world. The main protease SARS-CoV-2 M pro , one of the coronaviral nonstructural proteins, constitutes a promising target for the treatment of the global pandemic COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 M pro cleaves the viral polyprotein to several proteins, which are indispensable for the virus replication. Rut et al. used a HyCoSuL to determine the substrate specificity of the M pro using ACC-labeled substrates. The deconvolution identified the tetrapeptide Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC as the best substrate with a k cat /K M value of 859 M -1 s -1 (with Abu = (S)-2-aminobutyric acid and Tle = (S)-tert-leucine). The substrates were excited at 355 nm and the raising fluorescence was measured at 460 nm [100]. 5. Internally quenched fluorescent peptide substrates IQF peptides represent excellent tools to reconstruct the specificity profiles of proteases. Several donor/acceptor pairs have been established for the design of combinatorial libraries. These allow the deconvolution of the catalytic specificity of the protease of interest with respect to both, the non-primed and primed positions, and accordingly, the mapping of the non-primed and primed subsites. Suitable substrates for individual proteases can be obtained. Such approaches can circumvent restrictions of kinetically weak or inadequately selective substrates that only address to the non-primed region. In the following, we will discuss examples in which coumarins serve as donors and/or quenchers of IQF peptide substrates of serine and cysteine proteases.",

This noticeable quencher causes an only minimal perturbation of the native structure and efficient photoinduced electron transfer was achieved when the donor/acceptor pair was placed at least up to six amino acids apart [102]. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases with a pronounced primary specificity for aspartic acid in P1 position and are involved in inflammation and apoptosis. All members of the family of caspases are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens. These contain an Nterminal prodomain of variable length, a large central subunit with the active site cysteine, and a small C-terminal domain. Caspases were grouped into three subfamilies, inflammatory, initiator of apoptosis, and effector/executioner caspases. Caspase-1 belongs to the first group and is engaged in the processing of cytokine pro-forms and the release of the maturated proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\uf062 and IL-18. The executioner caspases 3 and 7 have activity towards multiple substrates, such as Bid, XIAP and gelsolin and initiate a series of events that directly lead to the morphological changes associated with apoptosis [103,104]. To monitor caspase-1, Ranganathan et al. used a N-acetylated pentapeptide with Trp (P4), Glu (P3), His (P2) Asp (P1) and a coumarin amino acid of type 11 (n = 0, X = OMe, Fig 3) at P1\u00b4 position.

Paschalidou et al. reported on a decapeptide with an N-terminal lysine equipped with a quenching 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) substituent at the \uf061amino group and a C-terminal (S)-2-amino-3-(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMP; 11, X = OMe, n = 0, see Fig. 3) at position P4'. DNP-Lys-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-AMP exhibited a k cat /K m value for human renin of 352,000 M -1 s -1 [32]. The principle of F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) relies on the detection of the emission of an acceptor chromophore which is excited through energy transfer from a nearby donor chromophore. Obviously, FRET can be utilized for the positional profiling or the establishment of peptidic protease substrates. Okorochenkova et al. constructed a threefluorophore system including a cleavage site for a trypsin-like protease (Ala-Lys-Ala) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (Ala-Phe-Ala, P1 amino acids are underlined) in a single compound. The authors introduced a coumarin amino acid of type 10 (n = 4, X = N(Et) 2 , Fig 3) C-terminal of the Ala-Lys-Ala motif, fluorescein between both motifs, and rhodamine B Nterminal of the Ala-Phe-Ala motif. This substrate employs a double-FRET mechanism.Following excitation of the coumarin at 435 nm and collecting the three emission signals of coumarin, fluorescein and rhodamine B, it was possible to detect and distinguish the activity of one or two proteases or their mixture. For example, in the presence of chymotrypsin and of the coumarin, energy transfer to fluorescein and a time-dependent increase of the fluorescein fluorescence occurred, which made ratiometric analyses possible[107].5.2. IQF substrates with an N-terminal coumarin moietyIQF peptide libraries with a coumarin positioned N-terminal of the scissile bond and, for example, 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene as quencher have also been launched for fingerprinting experiments towards protease specificity[108].An important class of proteases occurring in neutrophilic granulocytes are the so called neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), mainly cathepsin G, proteinase 3 and HNE. They are expressed during the myeloblast and promyelocyte stage of differentiation as inactive preproenzymes and are stored after N-terminal and C-terminal processing in azurophilic granules. Upon stimuli, the NSPs are released into the phagosome and the extracellular space or associated to the plasma membrane. After fusion of azurophilic granules with vacuoles carrying phagocytosed bacteria, NSPs function in intracellular host defense by degrading bacterial proteins. Once released into the extracellular space, NSPs are responsible for the destruction of proteins of the extracellular matrix including elastin, laminin, type IV collagen and fibronectin. Hence, they participate in neutrophil migration, and are also able to activate or inactivate cytokines. Altered activities of NSPs are connected to different diseases e.g.",

            "text": "A fluorescence-labeled dipeptide nitrile for cellular uptake studies[129]. valued for their fluorescence properties with rather large Stokes shifts and the opportunity to fine-tune the photochemical features by the tailored control of bond rotations and introduction of substituents. The coumarin scaffold is easily accessible by chemical synthesis. A particular advantage is the small size of coumarins which predestinate their incorporation into the side chain of amino acids. The resulting fluorescent amino acids can easily be introduced into peptides. This allows for the design of fluorescent peptides as valuable tools for the active-site mapping of proteases. Fluorophore/quencher pairs or FRET donor/acceptor pairs can be placed at the termini or inserted inside of these peptides. Besides the utilization of coumarins as structural components of substrates, they can also be beneficially applied for the design of activity-based probes for serine and cysteine proteases.CrediT author StatementMichael G\u00fctschow conceived the basic composition of the manuscript.

            "text": "The trypsin-like serine protease factor XIIa operates as the starting point for the intrinsic pathway of the secondary hemostasis. FXIIa activates plasma kallikrein which produces an amplification loop of FXII activation. In the coagulation cascade, factor XIIa ultimately leads to the activation of factor X to Xa, which itself activates, together with factor Va, prothrombin. Coumarin derivates of the anilide type the fused benzene ring of 14 are assumed to point to a tyrosine residue of a hydrophobic region within the active site of factor XIIa and the para-chlorophenol ring to extend toward the entry of the S1 pocket. The lactone function may contribute to binding by forming hydrogen bonds[42]. Both representative inhibitors were selective for factor XIIa over the related enzymes thrombin, factor Xa, factor VIIa, and plasma kallikrein[41,42].",
