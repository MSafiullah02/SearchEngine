Using telehealth offers opportunities for clinicians, as youth feel more comfortable using technology as compared with older adults. However, unlike in-person visits, providers cannot ensure during virtual visits that adolescents feel safe speaking confidentially. Providers should prioritize confidentiality during all parts of a visit, from scheduling to documenting. Schedulers should ask adolescents if they have a comfortable space to speak and if they have a safe phone where the virtual visit can be completed without being monitored. When completing AYA virtual visits with parents or other parties present, clinicians should set up expectations regarding the importance of having time to speak alone with the adolescent, aligned with best practices during in-person visits. If an adolescent does not feel safe talking during a virtual visit, providers may consider using the chat function, as long as the adolescent\u2019s phone or computer is not being monitored and conversations are not being saved. Additionally, although conducting visits virtually is safer for physical distancing, AYAs should be given a choice about completing a visit virtually or in-person. For some AYAs, healthcare centers may be one of the only available safe places.",
