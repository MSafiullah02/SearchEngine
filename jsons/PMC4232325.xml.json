Since the first \u2018macromolecular monolayer\u2019 described by Houwink and Le Poole (1952; Houwink, 1953) in the cell wall of a Spirillum sp., S\u2010layers have now been identified in hundreds of different species of almost every taxonomic group of walled Bacteria and are an almost universal feature of Archaea (Fig. 1; for compilation see, Messner & Sleytr, 1992; Sleytr et al., 1996a, 1999, 2002; Claus et al., 2005; K\u00f6nig et al., 2010; Messner et al., 2010; Albers & Meyer, 2011; Hynonen & Palva, 2013).",

Moreover, as the biomass of prokaryotic organisms surpasses the biomass of eukaryotic organism (Whitman et al., 1998), S\u2010layer proteins can be considered as one of the most abundant biopolymers on our planet. S\u2010layers also represent the simplest biological protein or glycoprotein membranes developed during evolution (Sleytr, 1975). They are generally composed of a single molecular species endowed with the ability to assemble on the cell surface into closed regular arrays occupying a low free\u2010energy arrangement. Studies on the in vivo morphogenesis of S\u2010layers demonstrated that at high growth rates, approximately 500 subunits per second must be synthesized, translocated to the cell surface, and incorporated into the existing S\u2010layer lattice (Sleytr & Messner, 1983; Sleytr & Beveridge, 1999). It is now evident that S\u2010layers as metabolic expensive products can provide organisms with an advantage of selection in quite diverse habitats. Although a considerable amount of knowledge has accumulated on the structure, assembly, chemistry, and genetics of S\u2010layers, relatively little firm data are available about their specific biological functions (Sleytr et al., 2002, 2007b; Hynonen & Palva, 2013). It is now recognized that they can function as protective coats, molecular sieves, molecule and ion traps, promoters for cell adhesion, immunomodulators, surface recognition, antifouling coatings, and virulence factors in pathogenic organisms. In those Archaea that possess S\u2010layers as the exclusive envelope component external to the cytoplasmic membrane, the lattice is involved in the determination of cell shape and as a structure aiding in the cell division process.",

Most relevant for applied S\u2010layer research is the capability of isolated S\u2010layer (glyco)proteins to assemble in defined orientations into crystalline arrays in suspension or on suitable surfaces or interfaces (Sleytr et al., 1999, 2005; Pum et al., 2006, 2010). As S\u2010layers are periodic structures, they exhibit repetitive identical physicochemical properties down to the subnanometer scale and possess pores identical in size and morphology. Most important, properties of S\u2010layer proteins can be changed by chemical modifications and genetic engineering. It is now evident that S\u2010layers also represent a unique structural basis and pattering element for generating complex supramolecular assemblies involving all relevant \u2018building blocks\u2019 such as proteins, lipids, glycans, and nucleic acids (Egelseer et al., 2008; Schuster & Sleytr, 2009b; Egelseer et al., 2010; Sleytr et al., 2010; Ilk et al., 2011a; Sleytr et al., 2011, 2013).",

More recently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become an important method for characterizing S\u2010layer lattices (M\u00fcller et al., 1996, 1999; Ebner et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2007; Moreno\u2010Flores et al., 2008; Chung et al., 2010; L\u00f3pez et al., 2011). In most Archaea, S\u2010layers represent the only wall component outside the plasma membrane (Fig. 2a and b). Only a few Archaea possess a rigid wall layer (e.g. pseudomurein in methanogenic Archaea) as intermediate layer between the cytoplasmic membrane and the S\u2010layer (Fig. 2c; Claus & K\u00f6nig, 2010; Albers & Meyer, 2011). In Gram\u2010positive Bacteria, S\u2010layers are attached to the rigid peptidoglycan\u2010containing layer (Fig. 2d), while in the more complex Gram\u2010negative bacterial cell envelope, the S\u2010layer adheres to the lipopolysaccharide of the outer membrane (Fig. 2e).",

For some organisms, two superimposed S\u2010layer lattices composed of different proteins have been observed (Sleytr & Messner, 1983; Sleytr et al., 1996b). Mono\u2010molecular arrays of proteinaceous subunits have also been observed in prokaryotic sheaths (Beveridge & Graham, 1991; Albers & Meyer, 2011), spore coats (Holt & Leadbetter, 1969), on the surface of the cell wall of eukaryotic algae (Roberts et al., 1985), fungal spores (Sleytr et al., 1969; Linder, 2009; Penfold et al., 2012), and gas vacuoles of prokaryotic organism (Cohen\u2010Bazire et al., 1969).

Hexagonal symmetry is predominant among Archaea (Messner & Sleytr, 1992; Messner et al., 2010; Albers & Meyer, 2011). Depending on the lattice type, the morphological units consist of one, two, three, four, or six monomers, respectively (Fig. 3).

Generally, S\u2010layers are isolated from cell wall fragments which were obtained by breaking up the cells and removing the content including the cytoplasmic membrane by addition of hydrogen bond\u2010breaking agents [e.g. guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl) or urea] (Sleytr & Messner, 1983; Schuster et al., 2005; Schuster & Sleytr, 2013), trichloroacetic acid (Nu\u00dfer et al., 1988), detergents, or cation substitution (e.g. Na+ or Li+, replacing Ca2+; Koval & Murray, 1984; Lortal et al., 1992, 1993), and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA; Cline et al., 1989). In certain cases, even washing cells with deionized water can lead to a dissociation of the S\u2010layer lattice (Kosma et al., 1995). The various extraction and disintegration experiments revealed that the intersubunit bonds in the S\u2010layer lattices are stronger than those binding the crystalline arrays to the supporting envelope layer (Sleytr & Glauert, 1976; Sleytr & Beveridge, 1999). This characteristic property is seen as a major requirement for continuous recrystallization of the lattice into a low free\u2010energy arrangement during cell growth and division. Some archaeal S\u2010layers have shown to be highly resistant to common denaturizing agents (Beveridge, 1994). Special isolation procedures are required for S\u2010layers in Archaea where they are associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (Nu\u00dfer et al., 1988; K\u00f6nig et al., 2004; Rachel, 2010). With many solubilized S\u2010layers, it has been demonstrated that isolated subunits reassemble into lattices identical to those observed on intact cells upon removal of the disrupting agent (see also section \u2018Assembly and morphogenesis\u2019).",

The pI values of the proteins range from 4 to 6. For some Archaea (e.g. Methanothermus fervidus) and in Lactobacilli, however, pIs of the S\u2010layer proteins between 8 and 10 have been determined. Comparative studies on S\u2010layer genes of organisms from different taxonomic affiliations revealed that homologies between nonrelated organisms are low despite the fact that their amino acid composition shows no significant difference. Nevertheless, it is quite obvious that common structural principles must exist in S\u2010layer proteins (e.g. the ability to form intersubunit bonds and to self\u2010assemble into monomolecular arrays, the formation of hydrophilic pores with low unspecific adsorption, and the interaction with underlying cell envelope components).",

The latter is a remarkable characteristic of many archaeal and some bacterial S\u2010layer proteins. In fact, S\u2010layer proteins were the first glycoproteins detected in prokaryotes (Mescher & Strominger, 1976; Sleytr & Thorne, 1976) and still are among the best\u2010studied examples of glycosylated prokaryotic proteins (S\u00e1ra et al., 1989; Sumper et al., 1990; Konrad & Eichler, 2002; Sleytr et al., 2002; Eichler & Adams, 2005; Messner et al., 2008, 2009; Albers & Meyer, 2011; Eichler & Maupin\u2010Furlow, 2013). The glycan chain and linkages of bacterial and archaeal glycoproteins are significantly different from those of eukaryotes (Sleytr et al., 2002; Sch\u00e4ffer & Messner, 2004; Messner et al., 2009). The Halobacterium salinarum S\u2010layer glycoprotein was the first noneukaryotic protein shown to be N\u2010glycosylated (Mescher & Strominger, 1976). Most archaeal S\u2010layer glycoprotein glycans consist of only short heteropolysaccharides, usually not built of repeating units. Moreover, the predominant linkage types are N\u2010glycosidic bonds where the glycan moieties are covalently linked to select asparagine residues of the target protein. Although most S\u2010layer proteins are either N\u2010 or O\u2010glycosylated, in few cases both modifications can be present on one protein at the same time (Albers & Meyer, 2011; Eichler & Maupin\u2010Furlow, 2013). An example constitutes the well\u2010characterized Halobacterium volcanii S\u2010layer glycoprotein contains both N\u2010 and O\u2010linked glycans (Sumper et al., 1990).",

To sum up, S\u2010layer glycoproteins are among the best\u2010studied examples of glycosylated prokaryotic proteins (Eichler & Adams, 2005; Messner et al., 2008, 2009; Albers & Meyer, 2011). Hence, a more detailed and comprehensive summary cannot be given and is out of the scope of this review. Nevertheless, at this point, we would like to refer to several recent reviews providing deeper information on the glycosylation process in general (Albers & Meyer, 2011; Eichler & Maupin\u2010Furlow, 2013; Messner et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Recently, yet another post\u2010translational modification of S\u2010layer glycoproteins was reported. It could be demonstrated that a subset of secreted euryarchaeal proteins, including the S\u2010layer glycoprotein, is processed and covalently linked to membrane\u2010embedded lipids involving membrane\u2010spanning enzymes referred to as archaeosortases (Szabo & Pohlschroder, 2012; Eichler & Maupin\u2010Furlow, 2013). A distinctive subfamily of the archaeosortase/exosortase superfamily is designated archaeosortase A (ArtA) because of its restriction to the Archaea and its remote homology to exosortase. To examine the role of ArtA from Haloferax volcanii for the first time in vivo, homologous recombination to construct deletion strains that lack the artA gene was performed (Abdul Halim et al., 2013). Comparison of wild\u2010type and the \u0394artA mutant strains resulted in multiple biological phenotypes including alteration in cell shape and the S\u2010layer. These results clearly demonstrated in vivo that, as predicted by in silico work (Haft et al., 2012), the C\u2010terminal hydrophobic transmembrane segment of H. volcanii S\u2010layer glycoprotein is processed by the ArtA. Because the C\u2010terminal tripartite structure consisting of a signature motif, a transmembrane alpha helix domain, and a cluster of basic residues, which is recognized by archaeosortases, is highly conserved in a large number of euryarchaeal S\u2010layer glycoproteins (all of which possess an archaeosortase), it is very likely that this proposed lipid\u2010anchoring mechanism is a broadly conserved euryarchaeal surface\u2010anchoring mechanism. Most relevant for in vivo membrane function and for nanobiotechnological applications (see also section \u2018S\u2010layer supported functional lipid membranes\u2019), this mechanism provides a membrane anchor for S\u2010layer glycoproteins without stuffing the lipid membrane with hydrophobic C\u2010terminal transmembrane domains. Most recent studies even indicated that the S\u2010layer lattice of H. volcanii is composed of two S\u2010layer glycoprotein populations. One type of glycoprotein population is anchored to the membrane via the C\u2010terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Fig 2a), while the other one is lipid\u2010modified for enabling membrane association in an EDTA\u2010sensitive manner (Fig 2b; Kandiba et al., 2013). Presently, however, little is known of how these protein\u2010processing events affect S\u2010layer behavior or architecture. Nevertheless, considering that S\u2010layer lattices assembled on lipid membranes (see section \u2018S\u2010layer protein\u2013lipid interaction\u2019) induce a nanopatterned fluidity of constituent membrane lipids, the supramolecular concept involving two types of S\u2010layer membrane anchoring mechanisms should provide organisms with more flexibility to adapt to changes in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature dependent membrane properties).",

The only requirement for maintaining highly ordered monomolecular arrays with no gaps on a growing cell surface is a continuous synthesis of a surplus of subunits and their translocation to sites of lattice growth. In most organisms, the rate of synthesis of S\u2010layer protein appears to be strictly controlled because only small amounts are detectable in the growth medium. On the other hand, studies on a variety of Bacillaceae have demonstrated that a pool of S\u2010layer subunits, at least sufficient for generating one complete S\u2010layer on the cell surface, may be present in the peptidoglycan\u2010containing cell wall matrix (Sleytr & Glauert, 1975, 1976; Breitwieser et al., 1992).",

In Gram\u2010positive Bacteria, lattice growth occurs primarily by insertion of multiple bands of S\u2010layers on the cylindrical part of the cell and at new cell poles. But the major area of S\u2010layer incorporation is a band at the sites of an incipient cell division (Sleytr & Glauert, 1976; Gruber & Sleytr, 1988; Sleytr & Messner, 1989). This particular band splits and covers the new poles of each progeny cell. These pole areas resemble static lattice domains because little or no S\u2010layer material is inserted at pre\u2010existing S\u2010layers at the poles. Further on, protein A/colloidal gold labeling showed for the hexagonal lattice on the cell surface of Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72 that the new bands were helically arranged over the cylindrical surface of the cell at a pitch angle related to the orientation of the hexagonal lattice. In Gram\u2010negative bacteria, however, S\u2010layer lattices grow by insertion of new subunits at diffuse sites over the main cell body (Smit & Agabian, 1982). No indications of growth bands or zones were found. From the limited data available, it appears that at least in Gram\u2010positive Bacteria, areas of lattice extensions superimpose areas of newly synthesized peptidoglycan.",

For this purpose, two strains of taxonomical closely related hyperthermophilic Bacteria were used (Thermoanaerobacter thermosaccarolyticum and Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfurium) showing square and hexagonal lattice symmetries, respectively. Upon dialysis of the disrupting agent (urea or GHCl, respectively), the isolated S\u2010layer proteins of both organisms reassembled into regular arrays on the cell walls from which they had been removed. Contrary to the large regular arrays on intact cells, the crystalline patches were much smaller. An unexpected finding was that the S\u2010layer proteins from one organism could attach to cell walls of the other one and form their patterns again. In addition, when a mixture of both S\u2010layer protein species (with square and hexagonal lattice symmetry, respectively) was supplied, small arrays of both types were formed. These observations clearly demonstrated that the information for the dynamic lattice formation and orientation resides in the proteins themselves and is not affected by the support (Sleytr, 1975, 1976).",

Analysis of cell morphology and lattice fault distribution provided strong evidence that the S\u2010layers lattice is not only involved in cell shape maintenance but must also be involved in cell fission (Harris & Scriven, 1970, 1971; Nabarro & Harris, 1971; Harris, 1975, 1978). Thermoproteus tenax, an extremely thermophilic archaeon, has a cylindrical shape with constant diameter, but is variable in length (Messner et al., 1986b; Wildhaber & Baumeister, 1987). While no dislocations could be observed on the hexagonal array covering the cylindrical part, six wedge disclinations could be visualized on each hemispherical cap. Thus, it was concluded that the elongation of the cylindrical part of the cell only requires insertion of S\u2010layer subunits at these distinct lattice faults (Messner et al., 1986b). More detailed studies on the involvement of an S\u2010layer in cell morphology and division has been reported for Methanocorpusculum sinense (Pum et al., 1991). The hexagonal S\u2010layer of this highly lobed organism forms a porous but strongly interconnected network. In freeze\u2010etched preparations of intact cells, numerous pentagons and heptagons could be detected in the hexagonal array. Complementary pairs of pentagons and heptagons were identified as the termination points of edge dislocations acting as sites for the incorporation of new morphological units into the lattice and as initiation points for the cell division process. In addition, the analysis of the number and distribution of lattice faults confirmed that the S\u2010layer continuously recrystallizes during cell growth, maintaining an equilibrium of lowest free energy (Pum et al., 1991; Sleytr et al., 2005). The tension within the S\u2010layer lattice is generated by the growth of the underlying protoplast and plasma membrane.",

It occurs upon dialysis of the disrupting agents as described before (Fig. 4). The formation of the self\u2010assembled arrays is only determined by the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chains, and consequently the tertiary structure of the S\u2010layer protein species (Sleytr, 1975). As S\u2010layer proteins have a high proportion of nonpolar amino acids, most likely, hydrophobic interactions are involved in the initial stage of the assembly process. Some S\u2010layers are stabilized by divalent cations, such as Ca2+ (Pum & Sleytr, 1994, 1995b; Norville et al., 2007; Baranova et al., 2012) and in the case of extremely halophiles by Mg2+ (Mescher & Strominger, 1976; Cline et al., 1989; Eichler et al., 2010) interacting with acidic amino acids. Studies on the distribution of functional groups on the surface have shown that free carboxylic acid groups and amino groups are arranged in close proximity and thus contribute to the cohesion of the proteins by electrostatic interactions (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987a; S\u00e1ra et al., 1988a; Pum et al., 1989; Gy\u00f6rvary et al., 2004). S\u2010layer proteins are noncovalently linked to each other and, in the case of their adhesion to supporting structures (e.g. silicon, metal or polymeric solid surfaces, or lipid membranes) differing combinations of weak bonds (hydrophobic bonds, ionic bonds involving divalent cations or direct interaction of polar groups, and hydrogen bonds), are responsible for the structural integrity as well. Nevertheless, disintegration and reassembly experiments led to the conclusion that the bonds holding the S\u2010layer proteins together must be much stronger than those binding them to the support (Sleytr, 1975, 1976, 1978). Once formed, S\u2010layer proteins were never observed to leave the lattice, and thus, it was concluded that lattice growth is irreversible and no S\u2010layer protein turnover occurs. The reason for this irreversibility may be that after the addition of the \u2018last\u2019 protein monomer to the (incomplete) morphological unit, this monomer is locked into place and now has a low probability of leaving (Chung et al., 2010; Comolli et al., 2013) because this final conformational arrangement in \u2018confinement\u2019 constitutes the state of lowest free energy (Chung et al., 2010).",

For example, the S\u2010layer protein SbpA, which is currently one of the most detailed studied S\u2010layer proteins for functionalizing solid supports, forms monolayers on hydrophobic and double layers on hydrophilic silicon supports (Gy\u00f6rvary et al., 2003; Moreno\u2010Flores et al., 2008). In addition, in comparison with hydrophilic surfaces, the layer formation is much faster on hydrophobic supports starting from many different nucleation sites and thus leading to a mosaic of small crystalline domains (2D powder). Along this line, the importance of the interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions was studied in detail by reassembling the S\u2010layer protein SbpA on self\u2010assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold composed of disulfides with different end groups [hydroxyl (OH) vs. methyl (CH3) groups] and lengths of the individual methylene chains (Moreno\u2010Flores et al., 2008). The formation of monolayers was observed when the hydrophobic end groups (CH3) surmounted the hydrophilic (OH) ones. On the contrary, double S\u2010layers were formed when hydrophilic (OH) groups superseded the hydrophobic (CH3) end groups. The threshold for the transition between native and non\u2010native S\u2010layer parameters was four methylene groups.

Although S\u2010layer proteins show low homology on the sequence level, common structural organization principles have been identified. The elucidation of the structure\u2013function relationship of distinct segments of S\u2010layer proteins started with the production of N\u2010 and C\u2010terminally truncated forms which were used for recrystallization and binding studies (Jarosch et al., 2001; Ilk et al., 2002; Huber et al., 2005). Thereby, it turned out that S\u2010layer proteins exhibit mostly two separated morphological regions: one responsible for cell wall binding and the other required for self\u2010assembly. The position of the cell wall\u2010anchoring region within the protein can vary between bacterial species. Studies on a great variety of S\u2010layer proteins from Bacillaceae revealed the existence of specific binding domains on the N\u2010terminal part for sugar polymers, so\u2010called secondary cell wall polymers (SCWPs), which are covalently linked to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall (Egelseer et al., 2010).",

These so\u2010called S\u2010layer homology (SLH) motifs are involved in cell wall anchoring of S\u2010layer proteins by recognizing a distinct type of SCWP, which carries pyruvic acid residues (Ries et al., 1997; Lemaire et al., 1998; Chauvaux et al., 1999; Ilk et al., 1999; Mesnage et al., 1999b, 2000; Cava et al., 2004; Mader et al., 2004; R\u00fcnzler et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2005). The need for pyruvylation was confirmed by the construction of knock\u2010out mutants in Bacillus anthracis and Thermus thermophilus (Mesnage et al., 2000; Cava et al., 2004) as well as by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy using the S\u2010layer protein rSbsB of G. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 and the corresponding SCWP (Petersen et al., 2008) as binding partners (Mader et al., 2004). For SbsB, the exclusive and complete responsibility of a functional domain formed by the three SLH motifs for SCWP recognition could be confirmed, whereas for SbpA, the S\u2010layer protein of L. sphaericus CCM 2177, an additional 58\u2010amino acid\u2010long SLH\u2010like motif is required (Mader et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2005). The strong correlation between the existence of SLH motifs and the presence of the gene for the pyruvyltransferase CsaB was demonstrated once again in a very recent study (Pleschberger et al., 2013). Sequencing of 8004 bp in the 5\u2032\u2010upstream region of the S\u2010layer gene sbpA led to the identification of a novel gene cluster comprising five open reading frames (ORFs) which encode proteins involved in cell wall metabolism of L. sphaericus CCM 2177. The two ORFs encoding the autolysin rAbpA and the pyruvyl transferase rCsaB were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinantly produced proteins were characterized regarding their secondary structure and their enzymatic activity (Pleschberger et al., 2013).",

It was demonstrated that the SLH motifs of SpaA are sufficient for in vivo cell surface display of foreign proteins at the cell surface of P. alvei. Furthermore, it was shown that in P. alvei, SLH domains have a dual\u2010recognition function, one for the SCWP and one for the peptidoglycan, and that cell wall anchoring of SpaA is not a prerequisite for glycosylation.

This is one\u2010third of this S\u2010layer protein and was suggested to be involved in cell wall binding (Smit et al., 2001; Antikainen et al., 2002). The thus far characterized cell wall ligands to which the Lactobacillus S\u2010layer attaches include teichoic acids, lipoteichoic acids, and neutral polysaccharides (Avall\u2010J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen & Palva, 2005).

However, contrary to the L. acidophilus\u2010group organisms, the specific cell wall component interacting with the S\u2010layer protein in L. brevis ATCC 8287 was shown to be different than (lipo)teichoic acid (Avall\u2010J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen et al., 2008).",

The specific type of phospholipids did not appear critical; phospholipids rather different from those present in Caulobacter membranes or archaeal ether lipids worked equally well.

Therefore, neither their tertiary structure nor exact amino acid or domain allocations in the lattices were known. A first tertiary structure prediction for an S\u2010layer protein (SbsB from G. stearothermophilus PV72/p2; S\u00e1ra et al., 1996b) was obtained by molecular dynamic simulations using the mean force method (Horejs et al., 2008). For the simulation of the folding, SbsB was divided into eight structurally independent domains: three domains at the N\u2010terminus and five domains at the C\u2010terminus. The N\u2010terminal domains consisted mainly of \u03b1\u2010helices and the C\u2010terminal ones of \u03b2\u2010sheets. The obtained tertiary structure of SbsB showed that the N\u2010terminus of SbsB1\u2013207 consists of six \u03b1\u2010helices that are linked by turns and coils. According to secondary structure predictions and sequence similarity searches, SbsB has three SLH domains with every domain made up of two \u03b1\u2010helices, respectively. The C\u2010terminus of SbsB accounts for the main part of the protein. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed for 30 ns (in vacuum) finally led to three main domains at the C\u2010terminal end. The first domain is linear (aa208\u2013aa486) and connects the N\u2010terminus with the L\u2010shaped part of the C\u2010terminus, which is made up of the other two domains (aa487\u2013aa755 and aa756\u2013aa920) which are fibronectin type III and Ig\u2010like group 2 domains, respectively.

Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is capable of lethality in both animals and humans and is a biothreat of great concern (Blendon et al., 2002). The surface of B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is unusually complex: an S\u2010layer is present underneath a poly\u2010\u03b3\u2010d\u2010glutamic acid capsule, and the two structures are independent (Mesnage et al., 1998). Two proteins, Sap (Surface array protein) and EA1 (Extractable Antigen 1), encoded by the clustered chromosomal genes sap and eag, are the S\u2010layer components (Etienne\u2010Toumelin et al., 1995; Mesnage et al., 1997). Both proteins have an N\u2010terminal cell wall\u2010anchoring domain consisting of three SLH motifs followed by a putative crystallization domain comprising 604 C\u2010terminal amino acids (Mesnage et al., 1999b; Candela et al., 2005). During the exponential growth phase, B. anthracis cells are surrounded by the Sap S\u2010layer protein, which is replaced by the EA1 S\u2010layer protein when the cells enter the stationary phase (Mignot et al., 2002). In vitro translation of selected ORFs on the virulence plasmid pXO1, followed by analysis of the reactivity of the ORF products with hyperimmune anti\u2010B. anthracis antisera, led to the identification of the two S\u2010layer proteins, both carrying three SLH motifs (Ariel et al., 2002). Immunoreactivity studies using a truncated S\u2010layer protein form devoid of the SLH moiety indicated that the C\u2010terminal segment contributes significantly to S\u2010layer immunogenicity (Ariel et al., 2002).",

The finding that B. cereus G9241 csaB mutants cannot retain S\u2010layer proteins and display a concomitant decrease in virulence suggests that S\u2010layer assembly is important for the pathogenesis of this anthrax\u2010like disease and that S\u2010layers and S\u2010layer\u2010associated proteins have many different functions during infection.

S\u2010layer proteins could mediate the binding to both the intestinal epithelial cells and some components of their extracellular matrix fibers, contributing to further tissue damage (Calabi et al., 2002; Cerquetti et al., 2002).

For this purpose, native and glutaraldehyde\u2010treated S\u2010layer containers were prepared that resembled the shape of whole bacterial cells (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987b). Native S\u2010layer containers were composed of three adjacent layers namely the S\u2010layer, the peptidoglycan\u2010containing layer, and an inner S\u2010layer attached to the inner face of the peptidoglycan layer. The latter was formed upon removal of the plasma membrane out of the pool of S\u2010layer subunits originally entrapped in the peptidoglycan layer (Breitwieser et al., 1992). To distinguish between the molecular sieving properties between the S\u2010layer and the peptidoglycan layer, the peptidoglycan layer was digested with lysozyme. The solutions selected for the molecular sieving measurements were sugars, proteins, and dextrans of increasing molecular weights. It was clearly demonstrated that the S\u2010layer lattices allow free passage for molecules with a molecular weight of up to 30 kD and showed sharp exclusion limits between molecular weights of 30 and 45 kD, suggesting a limiting pore diameter in the range of 3\u20134.5 nm which resembles the pore dimensions determined by high\u2010resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and AFM (Messner et al., 2010; Pavkov\u2010Keller et al., 2011). Moreover, of great relevance in these studies was the observation that the peptidoglycan layer does not limit the passage of molecules capable of penetrating the S\u2010layer. This information on the structure and function of different S\u2010layers of Bacillaceae makes it unlikely that their S\u2010layers have the potential to function as an effective barrier against lysogenic enzymes (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987b). Most important a great variety of permeability studies on S\u2010layers from Bacillaceae demonstrated that the surface and pore areas of the protein meshwork have a very low tendency for unspecific adsorption of (macro)molecules (Sleytr et al., 1986; S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987c, 1988; S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1993; S\u00e1ra et al., 1993; S\u00e1ra et al., 1996a). This characteristic of S\u2010layers is seen essential for maintaining an unhindered exchange of nutrients and metabolites between the cell and its environment. In this context, it is also important to note that the S\u2010layer in Gram\u2010positive Bacteria masks the net negative charge of the peptidoglycan layer which significantly determines interactions between living cells and its environment. The information available even allows the assumption that the S\u2010layer surface and the pore areas have excellent antifouling properties (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987b; Picher et al., 2013). With S\u2010layer carrying Lactobacillus strains, it could be demonstrated that variations in cell surface hydrophobicity and cell adhesion to surfaces may vary upon changes in pH and ionic strength of the environment (Vadillo\u2010Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2004).",

Affinity experiments strongly suggested the presence of a specific recognition mechanism between the amylase molecules and S\u2010layer protein domains either exposed on the outermost surface or inside the pores (Egelseer et al., 1995). For further comparative studies, the closely related S\u2010layer\u2010carrying (S+) strain G. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 which is completely covered by the S\u2010layer protein SbsC and the S\u2010layer\u2010deficient (S\u2212) variant thereof was selected as model system (Egelseer et al., 1996). On the genetic level, the S+ and the S\u2212 strain showed similarity values of 100%, except that in the S\u2212 variant, expression of the sbsC gene was found to be inhibited by the insertion of the bacterial insertion sequence (IS) element ISBst12 (Egelseer et al., 2000). On starch medium, both strains of G. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 secreted two smaller amylases and one HMMA into the culture fluid (Egelseer et al., 1996), but only the latter also remained cell\u2010associated. Using heterologously produced N\u2010 or C\u2010terminally truncated SbsC forms and the native HMMA for affinity studies, it turned out that the N\u2010terminal part of SbsC must comprise the binding region for the exoenzyme (Jarosch et al., 2001). After elucidation of the hmma gene sequence, the full\u2010length rHMMA, N\u2010 or C\u2010terminal rHMMA truncations, as well as C\u2010terminal rHMMA fragments were heterologously produced (Ferner\u2010Ortner\u2010Bleckmann et al., 2009).

On the basis of all available data, a specific binding region for each of the three cell wall components (rSbsC, SCWP, and peptidoglycan) could be identified in the C\u2010terminal part of the rHMMA, representing the smallest regions necessary for interaction (Ferner\u2010Ortner\u2010Bleckmann et al., 2009).",

A unique ecological role could be demonstrated for the cyanobacterial S\u2010layer of Synechococcus strain GL24. This bacterium was found to induce mineralization of fine\u2010grain gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) and calcite (CaCO3) in a fresh water lake (Thompson & Ferris, 1990). The S\u2010layer has a hexagonal monomer arrangement and provides regularly spaced, chemically identical nucleation sites for mineral growth (Schultze\u2010Lam et al., 1992; Schultze\u2010Lam & Beveridge, 1994a; Smarda et al., 2002). Mineral formation begins within the large holes of the array when Ca2+ binds to negatively charged sites on the S\u2010layer protein and is joined by SO42\u2212, initiating the formation of a mineral aggregate. Eventually, the S\u2010layer becomes encrusted with mineral and is shed so that cells have a patchy appearance with respect to the location of mineralized portions of their surface. Shedding of S\u2010layer material could be a common process of Bacteria to get rid of mineral depositions on their cell surface thereby maintaining basic vital processes such as growth and division as well as nutrient transport. The natural pH value of the lake (c. pH 7.9) promotes the formation of gypsum, but in the course of seasonal warming, further alkalization in the close microenvironment of each photosynthesizing cell pushes the solid mineral field toward the formation of stable calcite crystals in which the sulfate is replaced by carbonate. Although the involvement of cyanobacteria in the formation of calcium carbonate has been well established, microbial involvement in the formation of other carbonate minerals has not been extensively studied. In an experimental system, it could be demonstrated that Synechococcus mediates a similar sulfate\u2010to\u2010carbonate transformation when Sr2+ is the major divalent cation present, forming celestite and strontianite which were considered to be formed by abiogenic mechanisms such as evaporation (Schultze\u2010Lam & Beveridge, 1994b). Due to the difficulty of examining the process of calcite nucleation on natural matrices such as Synechococcus S\u2010layers, a very recent review focused on studies of nucleation at carboxyl\u2010terminated alkane thiol SAM surfaces on noble metal substrates. To some extent, these films provide a mimic of two key features of the Synechococcus S\u2010layer because they are rich in carboxyl groups that can bind Ca2+, and they present an ordered array of such functional groups (De Yoreo et al., 2013). The ability to form fine\u2010grain mineral sediments may be much more common among planktonic prokaryotes endowed with S\u2010layers than can be imagined currently (Klingl et al., 2011). Because prokaryotes exist since approximately 3.5 billion years, they could have had a major impact on global crust development.",

The S\u2010layer of Bacillus sphaericus JG\u2010A12, an isolate from a uranium mining waste pile in Germany, was shown to bind high amounts of toxic metals such as U, Cu, Pd(II), Pt(II), and Au(III) (Pollmann et al., 2006). Furthermore, Vel\u00e1squez and coworkers determined the tolerance of different Colombian B. sphaericus native strains to different heavy metals and came to the conclusion that their S\u2010layer proteins might have the ability to entrap metallic ions, either on living or dead cells (Vel\u00e1squez & Dussan, 2009). In 2010, a recombinant bioremediation agent of high efficiency and low cost was developed by inserting a hexa\u2010histidine peptide into a permissive site of the S\u2010layer protein RsaA of the harmless, Gram\u2010negative bacterium C. crescentus in order to remove cadmium from contaminated water samples (Patel et al., 2010). To summarize, these special capabilities of the bacterial cells and their S\u2010layers are highly interesting for the clean\u2010up of contaminated waste waters, for the recovery of precious metals from wastes of the electronic industry, as well as for the production of metal nanoclusters.",

S\u2010layer ultrafiltration membranes (SUMs) were produced by depositing S\u2010layer fragments as a coherent layer on microfiltration membranes. The mechanical and chemical stability of their composite structure is subsequently obtained by inter\u2010 and intramolecular cross\u2010linking. The chemical and thermal resistance of these membranes was shown to be comparable to polyamide membranes. The uniformity of functional groups on both the surface and within the pore area of the S\u2010layer lattice could be used for very accurate chemical modifications in the subnanometer range.",

The flux of SUMs ranges from 150 to 250 L m\u22122 h\u22121 when measured at 0.2 MPa with water (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1988). Surface properties and molecular sieving as well as antifouling characteristics of SUMs were tuned by chemical modifications involving activation of carboxyl groups with carbodiimides and subsequently converting them with differently sized and/or charged nucleophiles (K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1993; Weigert & S\u00e1ra, 1995; Sleytr et al., 2001). In this way, depending on the specific separation processes, SUMs can be prepared with different net charges, hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface properties and separation characteristics. Most important for separation processes, in comparison with conventional ultrafiltration membranes produced by amorphous polymers, SUMs revealed an extremely low unspecific protein adsorption (membrane fouling) in buffer solutions. Because of their high stability under shear forces, SUMs have also a broad application potential as a matrix for immobilizing functional molecules (e.g. ligands, enzymes, antibodies and antigens; Weiner et al., 1994a, b; Sleytr et al., 2001, 2002; S\u00e1ra et al., 2006a, b; Egelseer et al., 2010; Sleytr et al., 2011).

For immobilization of foreign, functional molecules such as enzymes, ligands, antigens, or antibodies, free carboxylic acid groups in the S\u2010layer protein were activated with water\u2010soluble carbodiimide which could then react with free amino groups of the macromolecules leading to stable peptide bonds between the S\u2010layer matrix and the immobilized protein (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1989; Sleytr et al., 1993b; Weiner et al., 1994a; K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1995b; Breitwieser et al., 1996; K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1996).

The activity of smaller enzymes retained upon immobilization strongly depended on the molecular size of the enzyme, the morphological properties of the S\u2010layer lattice as well as the applied immobilization procedure (K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1995a). For enzymes such as \u03b2\u2010glucosidase with a molecular size slightly above the pore size in the S\u2010layer lattice, an activity loss could be prevented by introducing spacer molecules which increased the distance between the immobilized enzyme and the S\u2010layer lattice (K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1995b).",

Significant advantages for enzyme immobilization by the S\u2010layer self\u2010assembly system over processes based on random immobilization of sole enzymes include the requirement of only a simple, one\u2010step incubation process for site\u2010directed immobilization without preceding surface activation of the support. Moreover, the provision of a cushion for the enzyme through the S\u2010layer moiety of the fusion protein prevents denaturation and consequently loss of enzyme activity upon immobilization. In a recent study, for the first time, self\u2010assembling biocatalysts, consisting of S\u2010layer lattices exhibiting surface exposed active multimeric extremozymes, were produced (Fig. 5; Ferner\u2010Ortner\u2010Bleckmann et al., 2013). The challenging step forward was to use enzymes of extremophiles which are active only in the multimeric state. For proof of concept, the tetrameric enzyme xylose isomerase and the trimeric enzyme carbonic anhydrase were selected and fused via a peptide linker to the C\u2010terminal end of the S\u2010layer protein SbpA of L. sphaericus CCM 2177. The study demonstrated that the outstanding robustness and high stability of multimeric extremozymes could be combined with the unique lattice forming capability and periodicity of bacterial S\u2010layers, thereby providing a matrix for a most accurate spatial presentation of the multimeric enzymes (Ferner\u2010Ortner\u2010Bleckmann et al., 2013).",

This was exemplified by two S\u2010layer/allergen fusion proteins, rSbpA/Bet v1 and rSbsC/Bet v1, carrying Bet v 1 at the C\u2010terminus (Breitwieser et al., 2002; Ilk et al., 2002). Immunological studies showed that both fusion proteins displayed strongly reduced IgE binding capacity compared with free rBet v 1 and promoted the induction of allergen\u2010specific Th0/1 cells and regulatory T cells (Bohle et al., 2004; Gerstmayr et al., 2007, 2009). For first studies, expression of the S\u2010layer/allergen fusion proteins was carried out in the Gram\u2010negative expression host E. coli which had to be followed by a very material and time consuming purification procedure to remove the associated endotoxin. In a more recent study, Bacillus subtilis 1012, a Gram\u2010positive, nonpathogenic organism with naturally high secretory capacity, was chosen as host for expression of the pyrogen\u2010free recombinant S\u2010layer/allergen fusion protein rSbpA/Bet v 1 (Ilk et al., 2011b). Structural and immunological investigations of the obtained fusion protein revealed that rSbpA/Bet v 1 was endotoxin\u2010free and showed excellent recrystallization properties and immune reactivity. To conclude, for the first time, a pyrogen\u2010free recombinant S\u2010layer/allergen fusion protein required for vaccine development was produced using a Gram\u2010positive expression system based on B. subtilis 1012 (Ilk et al., 2011b).",

In vitro cell culture studies showed that S\u2010layer coated emulsomes can be taken up by human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) without any significant cytotoxicity. S\u2010layer coating led to a change in the zeta potential of the emulsomes from positive to negative, thus protecting the cell from oxidative stress and cell membrane damage. By combining the high drug loading capacity of emulsomes with recombinant S\u2010layer technology, new applications for these emulsomes in nanomedicine, especially for drug delivery and targeting, can be envisaged (\u00dccisik et al., 2013a, b).",

The immune response to ToxC was sufficient to protect mice against tetanus toxin challenge and could be tested for the development of new live veterinary vaccines (Mesnage et al., 1999c). In a very recent study, the protective effect of EA1 against anthrax was investigated (Uchida et al., 2012). For that purpose, mice were intranasally immunized with recombinant EA1, followed by a lethal challenge of B. anthracis spores. It could be demonstrated that immunization with EA1 greatly reduced the number of bacteria in infected organs and protected the mice from lethal infection, thus suggesting that EA1 is a novel candidate for an anthrax vaccine.",

In a subsequent study, C. difficile S\u2010layer proteins were tested as a vaccine component in a series of immunization and challenge experiments with hamsters. However, none of the regimes tested conferred complete protection of animals and antibody stimulation was variable and generally modest or poor (Ni Eidhin et al., 2008). In a recent, novel approach, the C. difficile protease Cwp84, found to be associated with the S\u2010layer proteins, was evaluated as a vaccine antigen. Hamster immunization studies demonstrated that Cwp84 is an attractive component for inclusion in a vaccine to reduce C. difficile intestinal colonization in humans, which in turn may diminish the risk of C. difficile infection (Pechine et al., 2011).",

Electrostatic interaction has been figured out to exist between exposed carboxyl groups on the S\u2010layer lattice and zwitterionic or positively charged lipid head groups (K\u00fcpc\u00fc et al., 1995a; Hirn et al., 1999; Schuster et al., 1999) At least two to three contact points between the S\u2010layer protein and the attached lipid film have been identified (Fig. 6; Wetzer et al., 1998). Hence, < 5% of the lipid molecules of the adjacent monolayer are anchored to these contact points (protein domains) on the S\u2010layer protein. The remaining \u2265 95% lipid molecules may diffuse freely within the membrane between the pillars consisting of anchored lipid molecules (Schuster, 2005; Schuster & Sleytr, 2005, 2006, 2009b). These nanopatterned lipid membranes are also referred to as \u2018semi\u2010fluid membranes\u2019 (Pum & Sleytr, 1994) because of its widely retained fluid behavior (Gy\u00f6rvary et al., 1999; Hirn et al., 1999). Most important, although peptide side groups of the S\u2010layer protein interpenetrate the phospholipid head group regions almost in its entire depth, no impact on the hydrophobic lipid alkyl chains has been observed (Schuster et al., 1998a, b; Weygand et al., 1999, 2000, 2002; Schuster et al., 2003a). To enhance the stability of the composite SsLMs, head groups of phospholipids have been covalently linked to the S\u2010layer lattice (Schrems et al., 2011a, b). Interestingly, it became evident that in nature, archaeal S\u2010layer proteins are targeted for post\u2010translational modifications such as the addition of a lipid (Kikuchi et al., 1999; Konrad & Eichler, 2002; Szabo & Pohlschroder, 2012; Abdul Halim et al., 2013). Hence, our approach to link lipids covalently to S\u2010layer proteins is a biomimetic one as lipid modifications of S\u2010layer glycoproteins are a general property of, for example, halophilic Archaea. Lipid modification of the S\u2010layer glycoproteins takes place on the external cell surface that is following protein translocation across the membrane (Konrad & Eichler, 2002; Abdul Halim et al., 2013; Kandiba et al., 2013).",

Moreover, the reservoir may be tailored using a mixture from full\u2010length and truncated S\u2010layer proteins (Schuster & Sleytr, 2009a) or by the self\u2010assembly of a thiolated SCWP layer on the gold electrode prior S\u2010layer protein recrystallization (Sleytr et al., 2000, 2006; Schuster & Sleytr, 2009b). A very important feature of supported lipid membranes is to preserve a high degree of mobility of the lipid molecules within the membrane (fluidity) and at the same time exhibiting sound condition of the overall membrane structure (longevity). Gy\u00f6rvary and coworkers compared the mobility of lipid molecules of SsLMs to silane\u2010 and dextran\u2010supported phospholipid mono\u2010 and bilayers, respectively. Most probably due to the repetitive, nanopatterned local interactions of the S\u2010layer lattice with the lipid head groups, the fluidity of lipids was highest in SsLMs (Gy\u00f6rvary et al., 1999). Moreover, the longevity of a tetraetherlipid monolayer sandwiched by an S\u2010layer lattice on each side revealed in comparison with other approaches (e.g. tethered membranes, polymer cushion), an exceptional long\u2010term robustness of approximately 1 week (Schuster, 2005; Schuster & Sleytr, 2005, 2006, 2009b).

S\u2010layers are now recognized as one of the most common envelope surface structures in Archaea and Bacteria. The widespread occurrence and the high physiological expense of S\u2010layers raise the question of what selection advantage S\u2010layer carrying organisms would have in their natural and frequently highly competitive habitats. In this context, it is interesting to remember that under optimal growth conditions for Bacteria in continuous laboratory cultures, S\u2010layer\u2010deficient mutants, or variants possessing S\u2010layers composed of (glyco)protein subunits with lower molecular mass, frequently outgrow wild\u2010type strains (Gruber & Sleytr, 1991; Messner & Sleytr, 1992; S\u00e1ra et al., 1996b; Sleytr & Beveridge, 1999; Egelseer et al., 2000). Moreover, if present, S\u2010layers are also part of a more complex supramolecular envelope structure and consequently in functional terms must not be considered as isolated protein lattice. Defined domains of S\u2010layer proteins have been identified as being involved in specific interactions with supporting cell envelope components. As S\u2010layers are highly porous structures, some components of the supporting envelope layers such as side chains of lipopolysaccharides (in Gram\u2010negative bacteria; Chart et al., 1984), or SCWPs (in Gram\u2010positive bacteria), may protrude through the protein meshwork. The latter may explain the phenomenon that in Bacillaceae, the expression of a different S\u2010layer protein on the cell surface is accompanied by a change in the chemical composition of the S\u2010layer\u2010anchoring SCWP (S\u00e1ra et al., 1996b). In functional terms, such complete cell surface modifications could prevent either attachment of specific phages or delay host immune reactions in case of pathogenic organisms.",

            "text": "A striking feature of many S\u2010layers of Bacteria and Archaea is their excellent antifouling property. This unique characteristic was first observed in electron micrographs of freeze\u2010etched preparations (Sleytr & Glauert, 1975; Sleytr, 1978; Sleytr & Messner, 1983; Pum et al., 1991) involving ultrafast (30 000 K s\u22121) vitrification of intact cells (Robards & Sleytr, 1985). Even when cells were harvested from complex environments or growth media containing a great variety of macromolecular components, the S\u2010layer lattices were never masked by adsorbed molecules (Fig. 1). In this context, it has to be remembered that not only in fast frozen preparations but also in electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations the individual S\u2010layer proteins show deviations from precise lattice positions so that high\u2010resolution studies require digital image processing to correct the spatial distortions (Crowther & Sleytr, 1977; Saxton & Baumeister, 1982; Saxton et al., 1984; Henderson et al., 1986; Gil et al., 2006; Pavkov\u2010Keller et al., 2011). Obviously, the different electron microscopical preparation techniques retain deviations from the ideal crystal structure created by thermal lattice vibrations. These specific S\u2010layer properties may additionally influence interactions with molecules in close proximity and consequently the observed antifouling properties. More detailed studies on molecular interactions and permeability using isolated S\u2010layers or S\u2010layer ultrafiltration membranes (see section \u2018S\u2010Layers as molecular sieves and antifouling coating\u2019 and \u2018Isoporous ultrafiltration membranes\u2019) confirmed that the surface of the lattice in Bacteria is charge neutral, preventing nonspecific binding of molecules and pore blocking. Moreover, in Bacillacaea, it was shown that S\u2010layer lattices mask the net negative charge of the peptidoglycan\u2010containing layer (S\u00e1ra & Sleytr, 1987a; Gruber & Sleytr, 1991; Weigert & S\u00e1ra, 1995). Data derived from antifouling zwitterionic polymer coatings on composite nanofiltration membranes can lead to the conclusion that likewise the ultra\u2010low fouling properties of S\u2010layers may be affected by their zwitterionic surface properties (Ji et al., 2012). In zwitterionic coatings developed for many applications that require biofouling resistance, ions alternate perfectly in the subnanometer scale between positive and negative charges preventing adsorption of naturally occurring molecules, particularly proteins. Final proof for this hypothesis will depend on structural information of S\u2010layer lattices at atomic resolution and detailed information on the impact of an S\u2010layer surface on the molecular organization of the adjacent water boundary structure. Most recently, the unique antifouling properties of S\u2010layers were successfully exploited for coating microfluidic channels in lab\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip devices (Picher et al., 2013; Rothbauer et al., 2013).",

Studies on friction flows of liquids at nanopatterned interfaces have shown that the slippage of fluids at channel boundaries is greatly increased using surfaces that are patterned on the nanometer scale (Cottin\u2010Bizonne et al., 2003).

It will be interesting to see whether S\u2010layer glycosylation even amplifies these important boundary conditions and surface properties. We presume that besides the more specific functions identified for S\u2010layers of different organisms (e.g. specific interactions with molecules and cell surfaces as observed in pathogens), these features may turn out to be one of the most general ones among bacterial and archaeal S\u2010layers.

In this context, it is of particular relevance to remember that in H. volcanii S\u2010layer lattices, two glycoprotein populations coexist regarding their association with the plasma membrane. The first presumably corresponds to S\u2010layer glycoprotein anchored to the membrane via the C\u2010terminal transmembrane domain, whereas the other glycoprotein population is lipid\u2010modified (most presumably by archaetidic acid) and associated with the membrane (Kandiba et al., 2013).

Some head groups of the lipid molecules within the membrane (gray) interact electrostatically with certain domains on the S\u2010layer lattice. A further (glyco)protein S\u2010layer lattice can be recrystallized on the outer leaflet of the lipid membrane (left). In analogy, some head groups of the lipid molecules within the membrane (gray) interact electrostatically with certain domains of the S\u2010layer proteins. The lipid molecules on the left side depict schematically phospholipids, whereas the lipid molecules on the right side indicate ether lipids.",
