The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission. Results: Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P < 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values < 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925. The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 have abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results. Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system especially eosinophils is helpful in the prediction of severe COVID-19 cases.",

According to whether the patients in the severe group were admitted to the ICU or not during the course of the disease, they were divided into 9 cases in the severe ICU group and 18 cases in the severe non-ICU group. The time is used as the abscissa, and the median values of the blood routine parameters of each group are plotted as the ordinate. The leucocyte and neutrophil counts in the severe ICU group were higher than those in the common group and the severe non-ICU group on admission, and remained at a high level; these parameters in common and severe non-ICU groups showed a slight increasing trend during hospitalization ( Fig. 2A and B) . Lymphocyte count in the severe ICU group remained low, while this parameter in the severe non-ICU group showed a progressive rise, reaching the level of this parameter in common group on the fourteenth day (Fig. 2C) . Monocyte count in the severe ICU group was lower than that in the severe non-ICU group; the two groups showed different trends: the former decreased in number and remained low, while the latter like the common group showed an upward trend during hospitalization (Fig. 2D) . The number of eosinophils in the three groups decreased significantly on admission and showed an upward trend with the course of the disease; this number in the severe ICU group remained longer at low detection levels than those in the severe non-ICU group and the common group (Fig. 2E ). There was a downward trend of hemoglobin concentration in the three groups, with the most obvious in the severe ICU group (Fig. 2F ). Platelet count in the common group and the severe non-ICU group showed an upward trend, and that in the severe ICU group remained low (Fig. 2G ). The MLR in the common group was significantly lower than that in other two groups on admission, and it showed a downward trend after a slight increase in the initial treatment; the MLR in the severe non-ICU group and the severe ICU group showed a slight decline (Fig. 2H) . The NLR in the severe ICU group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups, and remained at a high level; the NLR in the severe non-ICU group was higher than that in the common group on admission and showed a gradual downward trend, which was consistent with that in the common group at the later stage; the NLR in common group was lower and kept a stable trend (Fig. 2I) . The PLR in the severe ICU group decreased rapidly after reaching its peak on the seventh day, and that in the other two groups showed a general downward trend (Fig. 2J ).",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a systemic multiple organ damage disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the lung as the main target organ. It can cause severe lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe cases which may lead to death [3] .The virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and enters the alveolar epithelial cells [5] , which induces the cells to release inflammatory factors and activate the abundant macrophages in the alveolar tissue; then macrophages releases the inducing factors and chemokines, which recruit a large number of mononuclear immune cells to aggregate and infiltrate the lung tissue; these further immune activation leads to a storm of inflammation and tissue damage [6] . Xu et al. also reported that the pathological anatomy results of death cases with COVID-19 showed that inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells, mainly lymphocytes, was dominant in the interstitial lung [7] . The above studies indicate that the significant decrease in the number of lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 may be related to the redistribution and the increased consumption of lymphocytes and defective hematopoiesis [8] . Li et al. found that some death cases of COVID-19 have superimposed bacterial pneumonia [9] . Bacterial infection leads to significant increased leucocyte count and neutrophil count. Some patients with COVID-19 have abnormal blood coagulation function: prothrombin time is prolonged and D-dimer is elevated [10] ; thrombosis leads to increased platelet consumption and decreased platelet number. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to causes damage to the ACE2-receptor-rich kidney tissue [11] and increase of inflammatory factors, which can cause reduced erythrogenesis and increased destruction of RBC, leading to anemia. The above pathophysiological changes of COVID-19 are consistent with those shown in Table 1 . The parameters of peripheral blood cells in patients with COVID-19 were significantly abnormal. Among them, the decrease in the number of lymphocytes was the most obvious. Hemoglobin and platelets were also significantly lower than those in the healthy control group. Peripheral blood combined parameters including NLR, MLR and PLR of patients increased significantly. This shows that monitoring the changes in blood routine parameters has important clinical significance. Studies have shown that the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 are related to the body's immune status and excessive inflammatory response [7] . In this study, by comparing and analyzing the peripheral blood routine parameters of common group and severe group, it was found that the absolute value of lymphocytes in severe group was significantly lower than that of common group, while the count of inflammatory neutrophils of severe group was significantly higher than that of common group. These changes showed the degree of inflammation in the body was further intensified, triggering an inflammatory storm and leading to increased tissue and cell damage [12] . Low lymphocyte level and impaired immune cell function lead to the dysfunction of immune system, which makes patients with severe COVID-19 might be more sensitive to bacterial infection [13] . The blood cell parameter NLR reflects this situation, so we speculate that the NLR has certain value in judging the severity of COVID-19. In order to further understand the value of various parameters of peripheral blood routine in COVID-19, this study performed a diagnostic analysis of various parameters of common and severe COVID-19. The results showed that NLR, MLR, lymphocyte absolute value and PLR all had high diagnostic value. The area under ROC curve of NLR was the largest, followed by the AUC of MLR. NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and it was found that the area under the curve reached 0.925, with higher sensitivity and specificity. As the disease progresses, some severe patients with COVID-19 need to be treated in the ICU. In this study, the severe patients were divided into two groups according to whether they were transferred to ICU or not, and the parameters of blood routine were compared between the two groups when they were admitted to the hospital. The results showed that the absolute value of lymphocytes in the severe ICU group was significantly lower, while the count of neutrophils in the severe ICU group were significantly higher, which is consistent with the results of Qin et al. [14] . The blood routine combination parameter NLR was more significant than the other two combination parameters MLR and PLR. NLR is a widely used biomarker for assessing the severity of bacterial infection [15] . Bacterial infections maybe play an important role in the outcome of COVID-19. Therefore, it may be necessary to enhance the immunity of patients and improve anti-bacterial treatment, especially for severe and critical patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The Seventh Revised Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Interim Guidance pointed out that the progressive decline of lymphocytes can be used as an early warning indicator for severe and critical clinical conditions. In order to understand the role of various parameters of peripheral blood cells in the early clinical typing, this study tracked and analyzed these parameters on admission, day 3, day 5, day 7, day 10 and day 14 in the common group, the severe non-ICU group and the severe ICU group, and drew a curve with the median value. The results showed that the absolute values of lymphocytes and monocytes in the severe ICU group remained low, which may be related to the fact that patients in the severe ICU group were prone to sepsis, resulting in a low immune response state [16] , unable to make a normal immune response to infection and a low number of immune cells [17] . And those of the common and severe non-ICU groups showed a progressive rise. The NLR parameters were always running at a high level and were significantly higher than the other two groups. The patient were constantly in a state of excessive inflammation, and the inflammatory storm is closely related to the severity of the disease [6] , indicating that NLR can better reflect the progress of the disease course. The severe non-ICU group showed a progressive decline as the condition improved. The PLR in the severe ICU group fluctuated greatly, reaching a peak on the 7th day after admission, which is consistent with the report by Qu using PLR as a monitoring indicator of disease progression [18] .This study also found that the hemoglobin of all three groups showed a downward trend, especially in the severe ICU group. This indicates that this novel coronavirus may affect the red blood cell system. Normally, in the acute phase of the lung infection caused by virus, eosinophils accumulate in infected tissues to resist virus infection, resulting in a decrease in eosinophils in peripheral blood [19] . This study found that this phenomenon also exists in COVID-19. The eosinophils significantly decreased in all three groups on admission. The time for eosinophil to increase in common group and severe non-ICU group was earlier than that in severe ICU group. In the severe ICU group, eosinophil gradually increased after the seventh day of admission. We also found that patients who have delay to the start of increase of eosinophil counts were at increased risk of severe outcome of COVID-19 after age adjustment (odds ratio, 2.291). Persistent low eosinophils counts might be an ominous sign [20] . The above results suggest that the lower count and delay in increasing of eosinophils may be the signs of poor outcome of COVID-19. It can be seen that the dynamic observation of blood routine parameters has important clinical value for judging the disease progression and early warning of clinical type changes.",

The lower count and delay in increasing of eosinophils can also be the signs of poor outcome of COVID-19. Thus, dynamic monitoring of the parameters of peripheral blood routine has important reference value for judging the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.",
