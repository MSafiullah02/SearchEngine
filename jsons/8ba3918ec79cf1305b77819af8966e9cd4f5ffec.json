Our case patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, on HeartMate II (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) LVAD as destination therapy, hypertension, atrial flutter and ischemic stroke who presented with a four-day history of fever, cough and shortness of breath following recent two-month travel to Egypt. Initial physical examination revealed a body temperature of 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius), normal mean arterial pressure by Doppler, and oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Arterial blood gas revealed a PaO 2 of 46 mmHg despite delivery of 100% FiO 2 via non-rebreather ventilation. LVAD parameters were stable on presentation. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Figure 1a ). The patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, with tachypnea and accessory muscle use. Due to concern for developing respiratory muscle fatigue and impending respiratory failure, the decision was made to pursue intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

At the time of writing, the patient remains critically ill, however with clinical improvement. Recent evidence suggests that patients with cardiovascular comorbidities appear to be at increased risk of morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. (2) Notably, prior studies have shown that cellular immunity is compromised among long-term LVAD recipients. (3, 4) This \"functionally immunocompromised state\" may in part explain the patient's rapid clinical deterioration and prolonged critical illness following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Increased susceptibility to viral infections, particularly COVID-19, in the setting of LVAD has not been reported previously in the literature. Furthermore, this case highlights an important consideration for management of ARDS as the safety and efficacy of prone positioning in the presence of LVAD is currently unknown. Finally, we propose the establishment of a COVID-LVAD registry to further understand the impact of COVID-19 on this advanced heart failure population.",
