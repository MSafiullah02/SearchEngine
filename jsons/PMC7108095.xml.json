We designed the case selection as follows: the first inclusion criterion was to retrospectively select all RVI episodes (irrespective of the CARVs detected) with known vaccination statuses. The next step was to divide the CARV episodes into 2 groups according to the vaccination status at each RVI episode (vaccinated or unvaccinated, in each corresponding flu season). Following recommendations from the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines [24], we excluded the CARV episodes taking place outside the flu seasons (between June and November) from both groups. We considered December to May as recruitment periods, according to our local and national epidemiological data, since influenza viruses were circulating in our community. The third step was to exclude episodes that occurred before day 90 after a stem cell infusion from the unvaccinated group, since the vaccine was not given to any recipients during that period and the first recorded influenza vaccine was given at day 91 after transplant. For both cohorts, we also excluded RVI episodes when baseline disease relapses occurred before the CARV episode. For recipients with more than 1 RVI episode in the same flu season, we applied the following criteria: recipients with more than 1 episode of CARV RVI other than influenza during the same flu season were computed only once and classed as not having an influenza infection in that season. Recipients with more than 1 episode of RVI and whose vaccination status changed between 2 consecutive CARV RVI episodes in the same season were computed twice: once in the non-vaccinated group and once (after vaccination) in the vaccinated group. If a recipient developed 2 RVI episodes caused by 2 different influenza viruses (ie, influenza A H1/N1 and B) at different time intervals during the same flu season, both episodes were computed in the corresponding group. When a recipient developed 2 influenza virus RVI episodes in the same season and the same influenza virus was detected, only the first episode was computed. Finally, when a recipient developed 2 RVI episodes, 1 of them caused by the influenza virus, we only computed the influenza episode in that season.",

This agrees with prior epidemiological studies and enquiries, where the vaccination rate has ranged from 20\u201360% after allo-HSCT [29\u201331]. However, some factors merit consideration when interpreting the reported vaccination rate. We did not detect all vaccinated recipients in our prospective respiratory virus survey, since those who were vaccinated may have had lower incidences of CARV RVIs and a lower propensity to seek medical attention or testing. However, the lack of consensus across current guidelines [12\u201315] regarding the timing and conditions in which the influenza vaccine should be administered, in particular when immunosuppressant therapy is required to treat active/uncontrolled moderate-to-severe GvHD, is likely the most important contributor to this apparently low vaccination rate. In these scenarios, physicians may decide to defer vaccination. Thus, based on our findings, we currently recommend flu vaccination at 3 months post-transplant to all of our recipients, irrespective of their immunosuppression status.",

Although the number of cases was limited, we did not find statistical differences regarding vaccinated recipients with or without GvHD (36 % vs 31%, respectively, P = .9), corticosteroids (40% vs 31%, P = .7), immunosuppressants (36% vs 29%, P = .7), or hypogammaglubulinemia (50% vs 30%, P = .1). In fact, our multivariate analysis revealed that vaccination status was the main condition associated with a lower influenza RVI prevalence in recipients with at least 1 episode of a CARV RVI. This is an important finding, since we provide clinical evidence that seasonal influenza vaccines could be clinically beneficial in allo-HSCT recipients, even when a significant number of vaccinated recipients had GvHD (19%), used immunosuppressants (54%), or used corticosteroids (22%).",

These data suggest that, even in cases where the expected serological response could be suboptimal (allo-HSCT <6 mo, GvHD, immunosuppressant use, or corticosteroid use), the influenza vaccine could elicit a clinical benefit through a cellularly-mediated effect, reducing the influenza infection prevalence and/or its severity.",
