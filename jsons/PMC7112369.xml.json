Some of them have been shown to possess immune-potentiating activities. For example, \u03b2-glucans from Ganoderma lucidum, and Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) induce protective immune responses to prevent microbial invasion and eliminate malignant tumors (Brown and Gordon, 2001, Du et al., 2012). Presumably, these polysaccharides bind to different receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) on macrophages, dendritic cells and other monocytes, and then activate them to release pro-inflammatory factors, cytokines and chemokines which help the host to constitute an intensive immune response (Shao et al., 2004).",

After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant (80 \u03bcl) was added with distilled water (110 \u03bcl), 6 M NaOH (10 \u03bcl) and 0.75 M PMP (200 \u03bcl), into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then vortex for 1 min. For the monosaccharide standards (mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, xylose, galactose, arabinose), standard monosaccharide (0.055 M, 10 \u03bcl) was mixed with 6 M NaOH (10 \u03bcl), distilled water (180 \u03bcl) and 0.75 M PMP solution (200 \u03bcl) and then vortex for 1 min. Each mixture was allowed to react for 60 min at 70 \u00b0C and subsequently neutralized with 6 M HCl solution (10 \u03bcl). The solution was extracted with chloroform and the aqueous layer was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane for UPLC analysis.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a pure pectic polysaccharide from H. cordata with immunostimulating activities.

Several literatures had reported that pectic polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory effects, such as complement fixation (Inngjerdingen et al., 2005), promotion of the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and the stimulation of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines (Ye & Lim, 2010). The previous studies on immunomodulation of H. cordata concentrated on the water and ethanolic extracts (Lau et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2008), and the study of the H. cordata polysaccharide was mainly on the antioxidant activities (Tian et al., 2011). In our study, HCP-2 exhibited non-cytotoxicity at the range of 0.01\u201350 \u03bcg/ml on human PBMCs in vitro (data not shown), and elicited strong responses on IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. As regards to the innate immunity, HCP-2 showed proinflammatory effects by stimulating monocyte functions, e.g., the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, as well as the MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES. Upon the initiation of pathogen infection, the body requires a few days to develop and expand effector T and B cells. During this critical timeframe, innate immune responses play an important role in controlling the infection. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such as Toll-like receptors of monocytes (especially macrophages and dendritic cells) recognize invasive pathogens, and immediately activate the innate immune to launch the immune and inflammatory responses. Macrophages and dendritic cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2) to recruit natural killer cells, monocytes and other immune cells for further pathogen elimination, and these cytokines and chemokines also assist in the shape of adaptive immune.",

After incubated with LPS-RS, a potent antagonist of TLR-4 for 12 h, the production of IL-1\u03b2 caused by HCP-2 markedly decreased (Fig. 7), which implied that HCP-2 may launch a series of the immune responses through activation of TLR-4 on the cell membrane of dendritic cells and macrophages.",

Taken together, HCP-2 induced an enhancement of innate immune responses and these results may benefit the understanding of the immunomodulatory effect of HCP-2 and the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
