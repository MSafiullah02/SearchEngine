            "text": "Despite being first reported more than 20 years ago, 1 engraftment syndrome (ES) remains a variably defined complication following hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant (HPCT). 2-4 ES is typically characterized by the occurrence of a new noninfectious fever that coincides with neutrophil engraftment. The fever may be associated with a skin rash, diarrhea, pulmonary infiltrates, or hepatic dysfunction. Although most cases of ES are self-limiting, some can be prolonged and cause severe symptoms, necessitating the use of corticosteroids. The underlying pathophysiology associated with ES remains poorly understood. Based on the Lewis rat syngeneic and autologous HPCT model, 5 ES is generally believed to have arisen due to the interplay between pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 associated with hematopoietic recovery in a setting with a deficiency of T reg cells.",

Most common diagnosis was multiple myeloma (53, 71%), followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (17, 22%), and Hodgkin's disease (5, 7%). Forty-six (61%) patients received a bortezomib-containing regimen prior to transplant.

No statistical differences were found among these three groups in age, sex distribution, dose of CD34+ cells infused, underlying diagnosis, prior use of bortezomib, transplant preparative regimen, and dose of GM-CSF per kg body weight.

By far, ES was the commonest cause for new fever that occurred after Day +8, being responsible for 67% of all late-onset fevers. ES resulted in significantly longer PT-LOS when compared with those without fever (P = 0.0001; HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-7.2; Figure 1C ). The median PT-LOS in patients with ES was 16 days (95% CI 15-20), when compared with 13 days (95% CI 13-14) in those without fever (P = 0.004). In conclusion, ES occurs frequently after autologous HPCT. ES not only increases transplant-related morbidities but also resource utilization. Identification of biomarkers that can be used to help diagnose ES is highly desirable so that these patients do not have to undergo unnecessary investigations and additional antimicrobial therapy that consequently result in longer PT-LOS and higher transplant costs. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been found to be associated with ES. 6 However, CRP is highly nonspecific and is also elevated in sepsis, the very complication that requires aggressive antimicrobial therapy in this group of immunocompromised patients.",

Combination of DFO and DFP is well established as a treatment for severe iron overload in heart dysfunction. 1 More recently, the combination of DFO and DFX has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating iron overload in TDT patients nonresponder to standard treatment regimens. 2 Successful combination therapy with DFX and DFP has been reported previously, 3 as being effective in reducing iron overload and superior in improving cardiac T2*, compliance and patient satisfaction compared with the deferoxamine/deferiprone combination. 4 The use of combination therapy to address intolerance to monotherapy is not common practice, due to the expectations that patients will continue to exhibit similar or worse lack of tolerance. Some TDT patients do not tolerate either mono or combined therapy, resulting in worsening iron overload and in poor prognosis in term of life expectancy. The median adherence, calculated as the percentage of drug taken in respect to the one issued, was 90%. Median iron intake from blood transfusions was 9.9 mg/year.

In addition to longer PT-LOS, ES led to an increase of 202 intravenous antimicrobial days (averaging 7.2 days/ES patient). Furthermore, 47 additional chest X-ray examinations (averaging 1.7/ES patient), and three computer-assisted tomographic scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were carried out among the 28 patients who developed ES. The total expenditure incurred by ES in 27 of these 28 patients for whom billing records were available was $1 980 402 (averaging $9825/patient with ES/day).",
