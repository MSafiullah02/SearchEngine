YouTube includes a large number of videos on the pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options of several health problems [6\u20139]. YouTube videos related to Ebola were viewed millions of times during the 2014 outbreak [10]. During disease outbreaks, online platforms should be considered a \u201cdouble edged sword,\u201d which can lead to positive and negative consequences. While the dissemination of accurate YouTube-based information may contribute to controlling the outbreak, misleading information may cause panic in society and increase the spread of disease.

The following scoring system was used in this study:1 point: The video is of poor quality, poor flow, lacking most information, and therefore not useful for patients.2 points: The video is generally of poor quality, and although some information is given, it is of limited use for patients.3 points: The video is of moderate quality, and some important information is sufficiently discussed. In these videos, accurate and incorrect information are presented in a balanced manner. However, high-quality information is provided together with misleading information.4 points: The video is of good quality and good flow. The video is useful for patients, covering the most relevant information and presenting accurate information to a large extent, but it may include minor deficiencies.5 points: The video is of excellent quality and excellent flow and is very useful for patients. These videos include completely accurate information [16].",

            "text": "Of the total videos, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high quality, 21.7% (n = 10) were of moderate quality, and 36.9% (n = 17) were of low quality. Khatri et al. [19] evaluated YouTube videos on the novel coronavirus outbreak and reported that 67% of the videos in English were useful. During the Zika virus pandemic and the H1N1 influenza pandemic, 70.3% and 61.3% of the videos, respectively, were reported to be useful and informative [20, 21]. However, there are also studies reporting lower rates of high-quality/useful videos outside of the pandemic [13, 22]. In the current study, several factors may have played a role in detecting relatively lower rates of high-quality/useful videos compared with other pandemic studies. In other studies, the pandemic was evaluated as a whole, whereas in this study, there was particular focus on the relationship between the pandemic and rheumatic diseases. This may have affected the results. The current study sample was relatively small compared with other pandemic studies, and the assessment of videos is subjective, and different criteria may have been used in other evaluations.",

Low-quality videos were predominantly sourced by patients/independent users and news agencies. In a study of the Zika virus pandemic, Bora et al. [20] reported that the main sources of informative videos were universities and misleading videos were produced by independent users. In contrast to the current study results, news agencies were found to be a source of informative videos. Khatri et al.

[23] stated that videos produced by independent users were of lower quality than videos from healthcare professionals. This study reveals the importance of source when reviewing videos to obtain medical information from YouTube. Although there is inconsistency in respect of news agencies, academics/universities and healthcare professionals should be considered the source of high-quality information. In the current study, all the videos from academics/universities were of high quality, but the number of videos was very low. Therefore, universities, academics, and healthcare professionals should be supported and motivated to produce videos that provide accurate, useful, and unbiased medical information.",

Although the results of the current study do not support this concern, low-quality YouTube videos during the Zika virus and H1N1 influenza pandemics were found to attract more Internet users than high-quality videos [20, 21]. YouTube studies conducted on Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated that Internet users tended to view useful videos [15, 24]. Users diagnosed with chronic rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome may be better able to distinguish misleading information compared with general users during an acute pandemic, as they already have a basic knowledge of rheumatological diseases. Additionally, high reputation of academics, universities, and physicians may have led the patients to keep the videos presented by these sources in the foreground. Therefore, high-quality videos may be more viewed.",

Another reason for the high frequency is that this attractive topic was presented in almost all of the videos provided by news agencies. The first question in the mind of rheumatology patients after the outbreak of COVID-19 has been the condition of current drug treatments. Considering the potential effects of rheumatology drugs on the immune system, it can be understood why this issue has been frequently discussed in the videos.",
