This was clearly revealed by the X-ray crystal structure at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, which showed that the norovirus 3C-like protease had the chymotrypsin-like fold (12) . The crystal structure also suggested that Glu54, as the third member carboxylate that interacted with His30, was involved in the catalysis just like typical chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (12) . It is suggested that the mechanism of the proteolysis by the norovirus 3C-like protease was identical to that of chymotrypsin; that is, the thiol of Cys139 attacks against a carbonyl carbon of the substrate, followed by protonation of the imidazole ring of His30 by the proton released from the thiol of Cys139. A negatively charged carboxylate of Glu54 interacts with and stabilizes the imidazole ring of His30. However, we had concluded that Glu54 was not essential for the activity because the Glu54-to-Ala mutant protease retained protease activity comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (11) . Independently, Zeitler et al. (13) resolved the crystal structure of Norwalk virus 3C-like protease at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution and insisted that Glu54 was a necessary component for the proteolysis. These controversial conclusions may have arisen from the difference in the methods used to assay the protease activity. Namely, we observed the cleavage of fusion proteins including the protease moiety expressed in Escherichia coli cells (11) , while Zeitler et al. (13) used a fluorogenic peptide substrate to assess the activity.

The Gln54 residue would provide a pair of electrons that is able to orient the imidazole ring of His30. In contrast, the E54N,C139S mutant showed no proteolytic activity.

There is room for argument with regard to the state of the SH group of Cys139 in norovirus 3C-like proteases, but even if the Cys SH is not deprotonated and the thiol is a nucleophile, a proton will be readily withdrawn by His30 upon a nucleophilic attack to a carbonyl carbon of the substrate.

Since the 2C/3A junction was rapidly cleaved when the ORF1 polyproteins were produced in mammalian cells (5), we chose the peptide including the 2C/3A junction for the in vitro assay. The wild-type GST-2TK-Pro protein cleaved the 2C/3A peptide effectively, and the k cat value of the cleavage by the wild-type protease was 0.63 s \u00c01 with the K m value of 0.53 mM ( Table 2 ). The GST protein derived from the pGEX-2TK vector had no proteolytic activity (data not shown).

Among these five Glu54 single mutant proteases, the E54D and E54Q mutant proteases had the highest protease activity, being 20-25% activity of the wild-type protease (Table 3 ). This suggests that the capability of forming a hydrogen bond with His30 is important for the activity. However, we were unable to determine the kinetic constants for these five mutants, even the E54D and E54Q mutants, because the rate of the proteolysis was already saturated at the lowest substrate concentration (5 mM) that was tested and because the activity of mutant proteases tended to be lowered in the higher concentration of the substrate (data not shown).

CONCLUSION The Glu54 residue is not essential for the proteolysis by norovirus 3C-like proteases, but clearly required for the effective proteolysis as indicated by the in vitro assays of the proteolysis. Although the mechanism of the proteolysis remains unclear and further in vitro analyses would be required, there is an intriguing possibility that norovirus 3C-like proteases adopt the papain-like mechanism involving a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, despite the fact that they are related structurally to chymotrypsinlike serine proteases. It is also noteworthy that the 3B/ 3C cleavage appeared to precede the 3A/3B cleavage in the proteolysis, as judged by the cleavage events by the E54I, E54L and E54P mutant fusion proteins. If the cleavage at both the 3A/3B and 3B/3C sites occurs in trans (intermolecularly), these two sites are thought to be equivalent against the attack of the 3C-like protease moiety. However, this idea should be denied by the results of the E54I, E54L and E54P mutants. Although these three mutant proteases are active at least in the precursor form, only the GST-3aB intermediate and the 3C-like protease were produced. This indicates that the 3B/3C cleavage event occurs in the manner different from the 3A/3B cleavage event, suggesting the cis (intramolecular) event at the 3B/3C site. Released E54I, E54L and E54P mutant 3C-like proteases were inactive probably because the side chain at position 54 sterically hindered the further proteolytic reaction. These results led us to assume that the spatial location of position 54 might vary depending on the 3B/3C cleavage event.
