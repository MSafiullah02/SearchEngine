Today, the international backbone financial infrastructures operate pretty well, but in the infrastructure towards clients, two issues are utmost critical for the banks: Drive By Download and Phishing; both are related to steeling identity and money via e-banking. This is one of the results achieved by the EU project Parsifal (Protection and Trust in Financial Infrastructure (Parsifal-Team, 2010), for compositing a research agenda for the cyber security of the financial industry.",

The financial sector was very early aware on information risks and provided according business continuity plans. First we describe the financial service and market infrastructure (section 2), then about the regulation and standards (section 3) and we elude on technical risks (section 4). As in every new trans-disciplinary topic, a glossary and an ontology (how the terms relate to each other) accepted for all parties has to be developed (section 5). Some aspects of actual status and trends of the financial infrastructure are presented in section 6. The Parsifal project's findings and its recommendation (section 7) give an introduction in the pending research challenges as it is in 2010, including the view of the experts and their priority.",

Put extremely simply, the US as of 2006 favoured strong strict central controls in the spirit of the original 1988 accords, the EU was more inclined to a distributed system managed collectively with a committee able to approve some exceptions.

It gives banks a power to review their risk management system. 3. The pillar aims to promote greater stability in the financial system by allowing market discipline to operate by requiring lenders to publicly provide details of their risk management activities, risk rating processes and risk distributions. Market discipline supplements regulation as sharing of information facilitates assessment of the bank by others including investors, analysts, customers, other banks and rating agencies. It leads to good corporate governance. When marketplace participants have a sufficient understanding of a bank's activities and the controls it has in place to manage its exposures, they are better able to distinguish between banking organizations so that they can reward those that manage their risks prudently and penalize those that do not.",

These services will be regulated by the member state in their \"home state\" (whereas currently under ISD, a service is regulated by the member state in which the service takes place). 2. Client categorisation: MiFID requires firms to categorise clients as \"eligible counterparties\", professional clients or retail clients (these have increasing levels of protection). Clear procedures must be in place to categorise clients and assess their suitability for each type of investment product. That said, the appropriateness of any investment advice or suggested financial transaction must still be verified before being given. 3. Client order handling: MiFID has requirements relating to the information that needs to be captured when accepting client orders, ensuring that a firm is acting in a client's best interests and as to how orders from different clients may be aggregated. 4. Pre-trade transparency: MiFID will require that operators of continuous order-matching systems must make aggregated order information on \"liquid shares\" available at the five best price levels on the buy and sell side; for quote-driven markets, the best bids and offers of market makers must be made available 5. Post-trade transparency: MiFID will require firms to publish the price, volume and time of all trades in listed shares, even if executed outside of a regulated market, unless certain requirements are met to allow for deferred publication. 6. Best execution: MiFID will require that firms take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result in the execution of an order for a client. The best possible result is not limited to execution price but also includes cost, speed, likelihood of execution and likelihood of settlement and any other factors deemed relevant. 7. Systematic Internaliser: a Systematic Internaliser is a firm that executes orders from its clients against its own book or against orders from other clients. MiFID will treat Systematic Internalisers as mini-exchanges hence, for example, they will be subject to pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements.",

Within a national state this has no legal obstacles, internationally, there are rules partly prohibiting a swap over. 4. Another major concern is operations with human interactions: First the human interactions are not scalable. Extra work force needs time to build and cannot be increased by factors within hours. Second, diseases such as bird's flue, SARS and new virus combinations may lower the operational workforce within hour to days, e.g. in two days the workforce could shrink by 80%. To counter fight such scenario, isolation of people, home working places, additional hygienic measures are foreseen, as well as reassigning displaceable work to other sites, where the disease is not active. 5.

Input data can be real time security events, historical attack data, logs, and other sources of information that concern other Semantic Room participants.

The current trend is probably closer to the first option, which has proven by the financial turmoil 2008/2009. Finance top managers are likely to act on two factors: first the consequences which may result from threat scenarios especially when compliance is not met, and second what they can actually do when such a scenario occurs. With respect to infrastructures these factors play in opposite directions: the more IT will take over services, the fewer financiers can act on infrastructure and will therefore not feel in command. This latter trend is very hard to reverse and deserves a more detailed analysis, respectively, the causality of unfortunate incidents and how business or management attitudes may trigger or facilitate these incidents and identifies lessons from it.

The final result was a set of eight recommendations for research. The next step was to prioritize these recommendations. The second workshop was used to present the recommendations to the stakeholders and ask them about their priorities. Using an online survey (via web and email), a wider group of stakeholders was contacted to include their priorities and recommendations.",

Vice versa the business failure have tradition and occur periodically form 1929 to 2009 again and again. Obviously the infrastructure risks were easier to handle and sector handled those better than their business. However, the ICT has a very unpredictable side, and this needs attention. From the Parsifal project stakeholder group we know what the future focus should be (table 1). We observe from the eight main challenges that there are many challenges related to identity management (1, 3, 4, 5) , two are related to business continuity management BCM and are rated as the most important one (7, 8) and the last two (cloud computing risks stemming from new technologies and trust indicators enabling clients to estimate trust-level for inter-acting with banks when connected with different infrastructures (home, office, public wireless etc.).",
