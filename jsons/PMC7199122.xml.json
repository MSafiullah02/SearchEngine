The WHO has declared COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to be a public health emergency of international concern.[1] Until effective therapeutics and vaccines become available, minimising the spread of COVID-19 is a pressing global challenge. Approximately 80% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic or present only with minor symptoms, whereas 15% become moderately to severely ill with cough and shortness of breath, and 5% require intensive care. Elderly people with underlying diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease and malignancies, are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Behavioural measures, such as coughing etiquette, hand washing, social distancing and reducing physical contact, are recommended to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, the effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed.",

First, smoking reduces CD4+ T-cells (helper T-cells), which promote antibody production in B-cells and activate killer T-cells to attack pathogens. Second, nicotine, a major component in tobacco products, which promotes the secretion of catecholamines and corticosteroids, could impair immune function and suppress the body\u2019s ability to combat infections.[5,6] Third, nicotine also reportedly inhibits the production of interleukin-22, which helps suppress lung inflammation and repair damaged cells.[7] Thus, in COVID-19, as well as in other infectious diseases, the risk of infection and increased disease severity could be higher in smokers. However, although there are reports of age, sex and underlying diseases being factors driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease deterioration, few studies have focused on the association with cigarette smoking.",

However, emerging data appear to indicate an increased risk of infection, morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with a history of smoking. According to the WHO, the mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 in China is higher among men (4.7%) than women (2.8%), which might reflect the large sex difference in smoking habits in China (52.1% in men and 2.7% in women).[8,9] In Western countries, where infection transmission has recently soared, smoking tends to be higher among men, although the sex difference is not as great as in China. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported that COVID-19 deaths were more frequent among men; a higher smoking rate in men might be attributable to the higher mortality.[10]",

Cigarette smoking decreases lung function, and evidently poses a general risk factor for severe respiratory infections, thus there is an apparent association between cigarette smoking and COVID-19 severity. The detailed mechanism by which COVID-19 becomes more severe in patients with a history of cigarette smoking warrants further investigation. There is also a need for more evidence on the effect of second-hand smoke on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, according to published COVID-19 research reports, even at this stage, it might be well assumed that smokers are likely to be at serious risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function as early as 1 month. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as part of public health measures to limit the global impact of COVID-19.",
