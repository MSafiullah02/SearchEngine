This is in contrast to the prevalence of enteric CCoV, which is frequently found in dogs younger than 1 year of age [10]. This may reflect different patterns of transmission of the two viruses. The seroprevalence of CRCoV was increasing after the age of 1 year for all studies and then reached a plateau between the ages of 2 and approximately 8 years. This is probably a consequence of the greater probability of exposure to the virus with increasing contact with other dogs. It is not certain how long CRCoV antibody levels in dogs remain stable after infection. One study showed a twofold decrease in antibody titers in 6 of 14 dogs tested and a fourfold decrease in 4 dogs in less than 1 year [21]. Because these were naturally occurring infections, it is not known if the antibody response measured reflected primary or repeated infections. The viral dose encountered by dogs would also influence the level and duration of the antibody response.",

CRCoV is frequently detected in dogs with clinical respiratory signs and may contribute to the CIRD complex. Increased awareness of the existence of CRCoV and the development of routinely available diagnostic tests should enhance our knowledge of the presence of CRCoV in canine populations with and without respiratory disease. It is recommended to use PCR methods or serology on paired serum samples to diagnose CRCoV infections, because the sensitivity of virus isolation is low. Identification of causative agents during outbreaks of respiratory disease in canine populations ought to be performed more frequently. This would help to determine the importance of individual viruses and bacteria, not only in the investigated population but in the CIRD complex as a whole. The etiology of CIRD is multifactorial and is likely to change continuously, because some pathogens are controlled by vaccination, although other infectious agents emerge to take their place.",

Group 1 contains enteric CCoV, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E). Group 3 contains the avian coronaviruses infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV).
