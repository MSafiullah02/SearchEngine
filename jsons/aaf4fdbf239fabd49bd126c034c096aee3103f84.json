Symptom-free intervals must also exist if the problem is intermittent in nature.

Predisposing factors such as allergy, trauma, dental infection, nasal anatomy, and systemic diseases (e.g., vasculitis, granulomatous disease, or immunodeficient states) contribute to the frequency and severity of symptoms. The most common virus implicated in acute rhinosinusitis is human rhinovirus, followed by coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus. Once the virus attaches to epithelial cells, there is an upregulation of inflammatory pathways resulting in the production of histamine, bradykinin, and various cytokines. A downstream effect of this inflammation is the suppression of macrophage and lymphocyte function, which creates a milieu susceptible to bacterial infection and overgrowth [4, 5] .",

This group reported a concordance rate of 93.8% for aerobic culture and 87.4% for anaerobic culture [17] . Further support for the validity of EMMC was demonstrated by two meta-analyses, the first in 2005 by Dubin et al., that revealed accuracy of 82% per isolate when compared with maxillary sinus aspirates [18] . Benninger and colleagues then described a sensitivity of 80.9% and specificity of 90.5%, a positive predictive value of 82.6%, a negative predictive value of 89.4%, and an overall accuracy of 87% of EMMC [19] .",

Only an ESR more than 20 mm/h in females and more than 10 mm/h in males, as well as a CRP more than 10 mg/l, were significantly associated with the correct diagnosis [20] .

In the Caldwell view, the X-ray beam is oriented directly through the forehead and is used to evaluate the frontal sinus. In one report, the sensitivity and specificity are somewhat modest at 76% and 79%, respectively [23] . When evaluating the efficacy of using a single Waters' view for diagnosing acute maxillary versus frontal rhinosinusitis, the accuracy has been shown to be even worse. When evaluating the maxillary sinus, a single Waters' view has a false-negative rate of 32% and a mean negative predictive value of 76.9%; and the sensitivity for evaluating the frontal sinus is only 14.6% when compared to CT. Radiologists in this study also could not commit to a diagnosis when evaluating the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, indicating that this modality is not adequate for the evaluation of these sinuses [24, 25] . Figures 3.2 and 3 .3 are plain X-rays of Caldwell and Waters views demonstrating mucosal thickening. These images reveal how the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis from X-ray can be difficult. Structural overlapping can lead to the impression of edematous mucosa, a hypoplastic sinus can be misinterpreted as pathological opacification, and infection can be difficult to distinguish from tumor and polyp.",

First, interpretation and standardization in the literature are difficult as there is no true \"gold standard\" with which to compare the various modalities. This problem has been extensively discussed in regard to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), as there has been poor correlation between symptoms and findings on CT imaging. For example, Hwang et al. found that 35% of patients with symptoms of CRS had negative CT imaging [32] . In 2002, Stankiewicz and Chow sought to determine the relationship between symptoms (as defined by the 1997 Rhinology task force), nasal endoscopy, and CT scan [33] . They found that neither endoscopy nor CT scanning correlated with the symptoms-based criteria for CRS, as more than 50% and 68% of patients who met the criteria for CRS had negative CT scans and normal endoscopic examinations. However, they did find that if purulence, polyps, or polypoid congested mucosa were present on endoscopy, sinus disease was usually present on the CT scan and that a negative endoscopic exam was a relatively good predictor of a negative CT scan [33] .",

We also believe that, given the poor sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging, there is little role for this modality in the diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis. Endoscopic evaluation on the other hand, if available, should be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis and should be considered before imaging.
