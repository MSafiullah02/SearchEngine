The wrap yarns and Tetoron \u00ae elastic yarns are then combined with different structures in order to form elastic knits. The elastic knits are then evaluated for their functions in terms of their antibacterial properties, far infrared radiation rate, and anion counts, as well as comfort in terms of settling time, wicking performance, water vapor permeability, softness, and air permeability, in order to examine the influences of jersey structure, stripe structures and mesh structures. The test results indicate that the combination of five green charcoal filaments and a mesh structure provides the elastic knits with the maximum functions and comfort, due to a high content of functional fibers per unit area. The optimal FIR emissivity reaches 0.89, maximum anion amount is 673\u00b121.4, and the highest permeability is 63.9\u00b12.6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s. As a result, the proposed elastic knits have an adjustable fabric structure that is feasible to meet any requirements and thus has a broad application range.",

Many developers have addressed these demands by making improvements with their design concepts for textiles, with having comfort, functions, and fashion as important indicators. Wearing textiles on a long term basis causes perspiration that discomforts wearers as the perspiration between the human body and garments causes moisture, humidity, and cold feelings. The perspirationsoaked textiles in turn become sticky on the skin, and thus hamper the movement of the body, and make people subject to cold illnesses. The fast-drying and moisture-wicking performance of the textiles leads to keeping skin dry skin and also pleasant wearing comfort. Related studies on moisture management yarns and fabrics have been conducted in response to these demands [1] [2] [3] .",

Textiles with antibacterial properties are thus important. There is a great variety of antibacterial agents, and the antibacterial yarns in this study that contain ZnO as the antibacterial agent. The Zn ions can damage the cell walls of the bacteria and prevent the respiration of the bacteria that leads to their death, and thereby attaining antibacterial efficacy. Therefore, ZnO [7, 8] has a higher application value when it is used in antibacterial fibers, fabrics, films, and coating, as well as biomedical materials [9] .",

Specifically, rays with wavelengths of 4.0 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm benefit the human body to the greatest extent, and are thus called fertility light in Japan. Far infrared rays in this particular range closely pertain to the growth of organisms, and accelerate the vibration of water molecules in the organisms to reach a resonance. Water molecules are thus activated, which expedites the metabolism of cells that allows for efficient nutrient transmission and waste disposal, as well as facilitates their gestation of cells. People use normal radioactive far infrared rays to attain thermal retention, and these infrared rays that are between 22 and 26 o C can keep the human body warm via three measures in terms of radioactive heat transfer, osmotic force, and resonance absorption.",

The yarns are then made into composite knitted fabrics using a circular knitting machine, and woven fabrics. The knitted fabrics and woven fabrics are tested in terms of different properties, thereby examining the influence of the content of metal hybrid yarns. Both previous studies indicated that the wrapping number of the yarns was linked to wicking behavior, drying capacity, and antibacterial properties [19, 20] . Unlike the previous studies, this study uses a rotary twisting machine to combine varying functional yarns into composite yarns. A rotary twisting machine can wrap and twist the composite yarns, providing them higher strengths. The composite yarns are made into three elastic knitted fabrics with a jersey, stripe, or mesh structure [21, 22] in order to have durability, high temperature resistance, softness, and air permeable features. The knitted fabrics are tested for functions (i.e. antibacterial, far infrared emissivity, and anion release) and comfort (i.e. wicking property, water vapor transmission rate, softness, and air permeability). The elastic knitted fabrics can be adjusted according to the practical needs, and thus have greater synergic effects and a variety of applications.",

In addition, these yarns are blended yarns that are composed of rayon/cotton fibers of 20/80, and thus they have antibacterial properties and elasticity that contribute to the comfort of the elastic knits. The major part is cotton fibers that have moisture-wicking performance. Perspiration can thus be conducted to the surface of the knits, and thereby obtaining moisture management. Moreover, the commercially available antibacterial materials are made of organic antibacterial agents, inorganic antibacterial agents, and biological antibacterial agents, while the inorganic antibacterial agent is used in this study [24] . Among the antibacterial principles of contact reaction, photocatalytic reaction, and injure DNA of microorganism, such as bacteria, the contact reaction principle applies to this study. Cells consist of phospholipid and have negative charges. When a small amount of Zn ions have contact with cell membranes, they can firmly adhere to cell membranes via the coulombian force due to the opposites attract theory. The breath of cell membranes is thus interfered with, and thereby jeopardizing some of their physiological functions and only leaving their vital force to a certain extent. However, the increasingly concentrated Zn ions penetrate cell membranes, and enter the interior of enchylema, and eventually react with -SH groups that suppress the activity of endoenzyme. The cell albumen is then solidified and stops nutrient transmission that in turn causes the death of the bacteria. This study uses this type of antibacterial agent as it reacts with perspiration and releases Zn ions, and thereby killing bacteria in order to obtain the antibacterial efficacy.",

Atoms at a stable status receive an energy provided by a heat source or the exposure to electromagnetic waves, and the electrons are thus stimulated and then migrate from an orbit of i=k to i=L. The electrons are then stabilized and are transferred in the orbits in a reverse sequence. During this process, electrons release energy. For some materials, the energy is released in the forms of FIR rays, which in turn cause heat and attain heat insulation. The FIR emissivity with their corresponding elastic knits is 0.87 for JK, 0.85 for MK, and 0.83 for SK. The FIR emissivity depends on the content of green charcoal yarns, and JK has the maximum content of green charcoal yarns per unit area, followed by MK, and eventually SK. However, more green charcoal yarns mean a higher cost of raw materials. The standard deviation of all elastic knits is 0.01, indicating a high manufacturing stability [19, 25] .",

            "text": "The settling time of elastic knits are ranked as JK, MK, and SK. The settling time is dependent on the content of the moisture management yarns (i.e., polyester yarns with a cross section). JK has the maximum content of moisture management yarns, followed by MK and then SK. As a result, JK has the shortest setting time, which is ascribed to the maximum content of these yarns. Similarly, JK also has the best vertical and transverse wicking performance, followed by MK, and eventually SK. These results are ascribed to the content of the moisture management yarns. More moisture management yarns have a positive influence on the vertical and transverse wicking performance. The results are in conformity with the findings in the previous study, where the woven fabrics showed the same trend. Namely, more multifunctional hybrid yarns improved the vertical and transverse wicking performance of the woven fabrics [19, 20] . In contrast, SK has the maximum water vapor permeability, followed by MK, and then JK. Because SK has a higher knit density, its structure is fluffier with a large size of pores. These characterizations are conducive for water vapor permeability. JK has the lowest air permeability as it has the maximum amount of yarns, which in turn is disadvantageous for the efficient moisture management. As a result, the water vapor permeability of JK is the poorest.",

This study examines the effect of knitting structures on the softness. The knits are stiff when having a high bending rigidity. Namely, the softness is poor. The thickness of knits is highly correlated with their softness. The fabrics become stiff as a result of the increasing thickness. For knits, a long loop length and a greater stitch both contribute to a higher softness. In particular, the softness along the course direction of SK is the lowest, as indicated in Figure 5 . This result is ascribed to the high thickness of SK. The stiffness of SK is increased as a result of a high thickness. However, regardless of the knit types of being SK, MK, or JK, the softness along the wale direction is about 6.0 cm, which is attributed to the consistent density of wale loops ( Table 3 ). The softness of knits is in relation to the comfort of wearers, and a low softness thus decreases the comfort.",

This manufacturing technique can replace some not eco-friendly manufacturing for products that are made with coating. In addition, the manufacturing allows for the combination of diverse functional yarns, and thereby attaining environmentally protective purposes and multiple functions of the elastic knits. The proposed elastic knits are suitable for their application to healthcare clothing that activates cells of the wearers. Moreover, they are flexible and comfortable and are free from disadvantages caused by the accumulated perspiration. The resulting healthcare clothing thus have antibacterial efficacy and does not generate odor due to the presence of residual bacteria. ",
