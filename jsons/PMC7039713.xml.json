            "text": "To characterize the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the dose-concentration response relationship of lansoprazole, we developed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that integrates information on the drug's physiochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, logP, pKa, and pH-deependent solubility), human anatomy and physiology. This PBPK model was developed based on available literature data and used prospectively in sensitivity analyses which showed that peak plasma concentrations is approximately 2 h and shifts later at higher gastric pH. Based on this preliminary analysis, blood will be drawn at 2 and 5 h post open-label genotype-tailored dosing. Using population PK-PD techniques, we will compute the area under the curve of all participants. We will perform an efficacy analysis to develop a pediatric population PK/PD model, which will establish a relationship between dosing conventions and plasma concentrations of lansoprazole by metabolizer phenotype. Plasma concentrations will also be compared to change in GERD symptoms. This model will be developed and qualified in three steps as outlined below.A.Exploratory analysis of PK and GERD symptom score dataAn exploratory analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between lansoprazole PK and GERD scores, to identify potential outliers, and to explore the impact of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and changes in GERD symptoms.B.Development of a population pharmacokinetic (pop-PK) modelA non-linear mixed effects modeling approach will be performed in NONMEM (v7.2 or higher) to determine the structural model that adequately describes the PK of lansoprazole and allows for the estimation of respective model parameters. Once an appropriate structural model has been selected, the variance structure of the model will be informed using pooled data from the intensive and sparse sampling periods of this study. The significance of covariates, particularly of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19, will be assessed using an automated stepwise covariate model building method. This method involves a forward selection and backward elimination of covariates in which one model for each relevant parameter-covariate relationship is prepared and tested in a univariate manner. Statistical criterion such as a p-value <.01 (objective function value (OFV); \u0394OFV of 6.64 for 1 degree of freedom assuming a chi-squared distribution) for the forward selection and a p-value <.001 (\u0394OFV of 10.83 for 1 degree of freedom assuming a chi-squared distribution) for the backward elimination will be used to indicate relations that are of interest for inclusion. The drop in OFV will be used to rank the covariate with the most important parameter-covariate relationship. The model with the largest drop in OFV will be used to include the covariate with the largest parameter-covariate relationship into the model. Goodness-of-fit and appropriateness of the final model from the SCM will be assessed by diagnostic plots, physiological meaningfulness of the obtained parameter estimates, visual predictive checks, and non-parametric bootstraps.C.Development of a population PK/PD model: Various empirical population PK/PD models have been reported for other PPIs in adults but none in children [48,49]. A population PK/PD model for the efficacy of lansoprazole in children will be established by linking the pop-PK model developed in (b) to an appropriate PD model. In order to identify an appropriate PD model, Emax, sigmoidal Emax and indirect response will be explored and the best model selected based on standard goodness-of-fit plots, reduction in OFV and visual predictive checks [50]. In addition, age-dependent changes in synthesis rates of proton pumps as well as circadian rhythms related to gastric acid secretions and food effects will be considered during model development [14].\n",

Numerous studies in adults have shown that CYP2C19 variants markedly influence the PK and PD of PPI [30,32,34,[53], [54], [55], [56]]. Patients needing acid-suppression who are EM or UM have higher treatment failure rates compared to NM when given conventional dosing [32,55,57]. H. pylori cure rates are significantly higher among PM compared to EM [31,58] and higher doses of PPI are required to eradicate H. pylori in EM [58,59]. Recent studies in children have also demonstrated the importance of CYP2C19 variants [[60], [61], [62]]. The clearance of pantoprazole was estimated in pediatric patients from birth to 16 years and was 60% lower in PMs compared to EMs [63]. Our group compared drug levels following a single dose of conventionally dosed lansoprazole with CYP2C19 genotype/metabolizer phenotype in 56 children with GERD and found a direct relationship between CYP2C19 diplotype and lansoprazole concentration [64]. We also recently found that EM children on conventional PPI dosing and undergoing esophageal pH probe testing had inadequate acid blockade compared to NM + PM. In addition, our group recently assessed all children who failed PPI therapy and subsequently underwent surgical gastric fundoplication who also had available endoscopic tissue samples for DNA genotyping. The children who failed PPI and required fundoplication were significantly more likely to have the EM phenotype compared to controls [4]. Significantly fewer children failing PPI and needing fundoplication had the PM phenotype compared to controls. Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that EM and UM children are being underdosed on conventional PPI dosing and will benefit from a higher (genotype-tailored) dose of PPI to achieve optimal anti-secretory response.",

Our group showed that PPI use at conventional doses for 6 months in asthmatic children without significant GERD at baseline was associated with significantly greater sinusitis, strep throat and URI [29]. In a subsequent genetic sub-study, we showed that participants with IM or PM had significantly higher lansoprazole levels compared to NM and were significantly more likely to suffer respiratory adverse events related to URI and strep/sore throat [64]. These same PM participants developed worse asthma controlled (triggered by URI) compared to NM after 4 months on conventional PPI dosing [71]. Conventional dosing of PPI in these IM and PM patients is likely to improve GERD symptoms at the cost of greater risk of URIs. Since URIs are the most common trigger for loss of asthma control in children, conventional dosing may not ultimately not help asthma control due to greater URIs. Instead, we propose that these IM or PM patients could be given a genotype-tailored dose providing normal serum concentrations and improved GERD symptoms with the risk of excess URI. We will collect nasal wash samples from participants with URIs to microbiologically confirm URI.",

CYP2C19*17 is a gain of function allele that increases drug clearance. Our prior PK data in children support the use of five distinct metabolizer phenotypes which warrant distinct dosing adjustments from the conventional two-tiered dosing. We have developed an evidenced-based dosing algorithm tailored to Extensive (EM), Ultra-rapid (UM), Intermediate (IM) and Poor metabolizers (PM) that is based on pediatric PK principles after analyzing the limited extant pediatric data.

Our study was designed with a two-step randomization to study both pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Participants will be randomized to: (1) open label conventional or genotype-tailored lansoprazole for PK analysis then (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole or placebo intervention. The part 2 randomization will not be stratified based on results of the part 1 randomization because we felt the impact on change in ACQ at 6 months would be minimal, though it is theoretically possible. To characterize the effect of PPI on asthma, we also made specific choices to safely and specifically measure efficacy. Lansoprazole has been approved by the FDA down to age 12 months for the indications GERD, duodenal ulcers, H. pylori eradication, benign gastric ulcer, NSAID-associated gastric ulcer, eosinophilic esophagitis, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. It has been used in >10,000 patients in phase II and III clinical trials involving varying doses and durations and have been found to be well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. Rarely (~1% of cases) patients have reported diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea with use of lansoprazole. The current FDA label for lansoprazole states that PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk for C. difficile associated diarrhea. Long term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increase risk of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine, and hypomagnesemia rarely. To include only \u2018mild\u2019 GERD, we chose to exclude children at enrollment with a GSAS >80. Previous studies in our patient population have shown that children without diagnosed GERD had a GSAS score ranging from 0 to 276 with a mean (SD) = 18.6 (29.5) [45]. This threshold was chosen as it was 2 SD above the mean GSAS for a group of children without reported GERD at baseline [29]. We selected the ACQ as our primary outcome because: (1) it is a sensitive measure of asthma control, (2) it is validated for children and adults in Spanish and English, and (3) its simplicity.",
