As shown in Fig. 1A, mice immunized with the S-CT24 peptide demonstrated very strong reactivity against the S-CT24 peptide (2.064 \u00b1 0.162), suggesting that the S-CT24 peptide induced a high antibody response. In contrast, mice immunized with the S-CT17 peptide and whole PEDV antigen showed no reactivity against the S-CT24 peptide (0.044 \u00b1 0.007 and 0.050 \u00b1 0.008, respectively). When the antisera were reacted with whole PEDV antigen mice immunized with whole virus antigen showed high antibody reactivity (0.642 \u00b1 0.056) while mice immunized with the S-CT24 peptide showed moderate reactivity (0.113 \u00b1 0.011). However, mice immunized with the S-CT17 peptide still did not exhibit any antibody reactivity (0.050 \u00b1 0.009) (Fig. 1B). In Fig. 1C, an ELISA using the S-CT17 peptide as coating antigen revealed that the S-CT17 peptide failed to induce detectable antibody response in mice unlike that of the S-CT24 peptide. In addition, sera from mice immunized with the S-CT24 peptide did not show any antibody reactivity with the S-CT17 peptide, indicating that there was no antibody cross-reactivity with the S-CT17 peptide. Another observation is the similarity in the antibody profiles of the S-CT24 antisera and 2C10 mAb. The 2C10 mAb strongly reacted with the S-CT24 peptide (1.085 \u00b1 0.042) while showing moderate reactivity against whole PEDV antigen (0.167 \u00b1 0.013) and very low reactivity towards the S-CT17 peptide (0.049 \u00b1 0.002), comparable with the reactivities of antiS-CT24 antibodies against the same antigens. From these results, it is interesting to note that although the S-CT24 peptide is only 24 amino acids long, it can induce a high antibody response in mice. The S-CT24 peptide varies from the S-CT17 peptide only by the insertion of seven amino acids (GPRLQPY). These findings suggest that the GPRLQPY motif found within the C-terminal region of the spike protein is highly antigenic and capable of inducing an antibody response that has measurable reactivity against PEDV.",

Fig. 2\nshows the result of FRNT with KPEDV-9 in the presence of anti-PEDV polyclonal antisera, antiS-CT24 antisera, and 2C10 mAb at various dilutions. KPEDV-9 showed an infectivity titer of 25 \u00b1 3.3 ffu per well when mixed with diluted normal mouse serum (1:400). When mixed with antiS-CT24 antisera or 2C10 mAb, the infectivity of KPEDV-9 was decreased by more than 50% under similar conditions (10 \u00b1 1.6 ffu per well or 60% reduction and 6 \u00b1 2.5 ffu per well or 76% reduction, respectively). Interestingly, the polyclonal antisera from mice immunized with KPEDV-9 only showed a 40% reduction in virus infectivity (15 \u00b1 1.9 ffu per well), comparably lower than that of the antiS-CT24 antisera and 2C10 mAb under similar conditions. These observations imply that antibodies generated by the S-CT24 peptide have neutralizing activities against PEDV comparable to that of the 2C10 mAb. It is important to note that lower dilution (1:100) of the antisera reduced the number of foci (<3 ffu per well). However, the number of foci in the virus control was also reduced drastically (<15 per well) (data not shown), suggesting that other components in the serum may already affect the infectivity of the virus.",

            "text": "Several studies have identified the spike protein as the primary surface glycoprotein involved in virus attachment and entry of coronaviruses (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The amino-terminal half (S1) is involved in virus attachment with host cellular receptors (Delmas and Laude, 1990, Cavanagh, 1995), while the carboxy-terminal half (S2) undergoes conformational changes after S1 attachment to facilitate fusion of the virus envelope with the host membrane and allowing entry of the viral genome into the host (Yoo et al., 1991). Because of the important role of the spike protein in initiating viral entry, development of vaccines that aims to prevent virus entry must be directed against this protein (Duarte and Laude, 1994). In the case of PEDV, recombinant vaccines currently being studied have focused solely on the COE epitope (a.a. 422\u2013638), based on the findings of Chang et al. (2002) which identified this core neutralizing epitope by comparing the sequence homology of the PEDV spike protein with the CO-26K fragment of TGEV (Kang et al., 2006).",

Phages displaying this motif have been observed to block 2C10, a monoclonal antibody that exhibits neutralizing activities against PEDV in vitro. Although it is known that the carboxy-terminal endodomain is involved in the assembly of spike protein and progeny virions by interacting with the matrix protein (Godeke et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004), it is still unclear what role this domain has in viral entry, and how antibodies that recognize this domain reduce virus infectivity in Vero cells. However, an antigenic motif on the endodomain of a surface glycoprotein of viruses exists like the 746ERDRD750 motif on HIV gp41 (Broliden et al., 1992). The exact membrane topology and location of this motif is still controversial, and it has been suggested that the antibodies that antibodies against this motif on the gp41 glycoprotein cross reacts with an antigenically similar epitope on the ectodomain of p17 matrix protein (Buratti et al., 1997). Nonetheless, the antibodies that recognize such motif have neutralizing activities against the virus (Boucher et al., 1990).",

The antigenicity of the peptide which carried the GPRLQPY motif (S-CT24) induced high antibody production in mice while the other peptide which had the GPRLQPY motif removed (S-CT17) did not elicit detectable antibody response in mice. The antibodies induced by the S-CT24 peptide was shown to be specific for the GPRLQPY motif as it did not react to the S-CT17 peptide in ELISA. Antibody specificity may be evaluated using linear peptides of 10 amino acids in length and that certain antibodies only require about two to three residues for recognition (Das and Hari, 1994, Van Regenmortel, 1992). Hence, our findings clearly suggest that antibodies directed against the GPRLQPY motif on the C-terminal endodomain of the spike protein of PEDV are capable of neutralizing PEDV.",
