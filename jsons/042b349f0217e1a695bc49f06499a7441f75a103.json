These franchises were typically of seven years duration and heavily proscribed, particularly in terms of minimum service levels. An initial assessment (based on data for 1996/1997 to 1999/2000) indicated that this phase was welfare positive, at least for the central scenario (Pollitt and Smith, 2002, Table 6 ).

New Labour were committed to dealing with the railways as they found them and this meant in practice providing greater direction by replacing OPRAF with the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). Over this period, nine TOCs were re-franchised, with an emphasis, at least initially, on longer and more open contracts. However, this second phase was quickly overtaken by the events that were triggered by the Hatfield rail accident in October 2000 which resulted in the privatised track authority, Railtrack, being placed into administration and being eventually replaced some two years later by Network Rail, initially a hybrid organisation set up as a company limited by guarantee but classified by the Office for National Statistics as a public body in 2014. Cost increases were incurred for both infrastructure and operations (Smith, 2006) and, largely as a consequence, one franchise failed (Connex South Eastern -serving part of the London commuter market), whilst 13 were renegotiated in one form or another, although it should be noted that these were, in the main, franchises let during phase one.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1090, "end": 1103, "text": "(Smith, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Franchising"}, {"text": "As a result, Government took greater control of the rail system in the third phase of rail franchising that ran from around 2005 to 2012.

Over this period, 12 TOCs were refranchised, with in most cases a cap and collar risk-sharing scheme implemented to overcome concerns that post-Hatfield bidders would be excessively risk averse. These arrangements, which typically came into operation after four years of a franchise, involved TOCs sharing 50% of any fares revenue above 102% of the bid profile with the DfT (the cap). Conversely, DfT would make-up 50% of any revenue shortfalls between 96% and 98% of the bid profile and 80% of shortfalls below 96% (the collar). The outcome was that these arrangements seemed to encourage strategic behaviour, with bids backloaded in terms of premium payments and reliant on large revenue growth. As the key assessment criteria for a franchise bid was the difference between revenue and costs but the cap and collar incentive was based on revenue, there may have been incentives to overstate both revenue and costs at the bidding stage. There were also concerns that subsidy at the beginning of a franchise was being treated as cheap cash to finance Parent Group activity in other businesses and that, once the collar was invoked, the incentive to grow revenue was muted. The problems were symbolised by the successive failures of the TOC operating long distance services on the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh; GNER (in 2007), National Express East Coast (in 2009) (Preston, 2017, McCartney and Stittle, 2011) and most recently Virgin Trains East Coast (2018).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1622, "end": 1651, "text": "(Preston, 2017, McCartney and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1666, "text": "Stittle, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Franchising"}, {"text": "Given problems with the cap and collar regime, a fourth phase of franchising was introduced in 2012, with the introduction of the Subordinated Loan Facility (SLF), which is capital provided by the bidder's parent company, used to cover operator losses, protect the DfT against default and to guarantee premium payments. In addition, there was also a performance bond to cover the cost to the DfT of running services and re-letting a franchise if the operator defaults. These measures were designed to discourage the overoptimistic bidding that had characterised the third phases(HC796, 2012), although there was a problem in that the SLF was not known in advance. Moreover, the first application for the West Coast franchise (that provided long distance services on the West Coast Main Line between London and Glasgow) revealed errors in the calculation of the SLF. This led to the subsequent cancellation of the West Coast franchise, the suspension of the overall franchising programme and the instigation of the Laidlaw Enquiry (HC 809, 2012) and the Brown Review (Cm8526, 2013) (see also Jupe, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1091, "end": 1102, "text": "Jupe, 2013)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Franchising"}, {"text": "The fifth phase of franchising commenced in 2014, with the DfT taking what has been described as a 'horses for courses' approach -with the contract specifications customised to take into account the peculiarities of individual franchises (Preston, 2017) .

This methodology consists of a demand forecasting model to determine the extent to which changes can be associated with the privatisation policy package and to assess changes in consumer surplus and total revenue. Extrapolative five years moving average models are used to determine the counterfactual trends in fares, train kilometres, operating costs and capital costs. A series of demand forecasting models were tested, with the recommended model based on a simple negative exponential or semi-log time series formulation using annual data for the national system as follows: Table 3 . The estimated coefficients of equation 1, using data from 1979/80 to 2017/18 (39 observations), and some diagnostic statistics are given in Table 4 . All parameters are statistically significant (at the 5% level), the model explains almost 99% of variation in the data and autocorrelation (as measured by the Durbin-Watson statistic) does not appear to be a significant problem. However, analysis of the collinearity diagnostics indicated that multicollinearity is an issue in that the Variance Inflation Factors for two of the independent variables (TKM and GDP) are greater than 10. However, it was assumed that this pattern of multicollinearity will persist in the future and there were strong grounds, a priori, to include both of these explanatory variables. The dummy variables in the model indicate that privatisation suppressed demand between 1992/3 and 2005/6 by around 7.8% (1 -exp \u03b8) whilst the Hatfield accident suppressed demand between 2000/1 and 2006/6 by a further 5.5% (1 -exp \u03bc). The strike in 1982/3 (train drivers) was estimated to reduce demand by around 6.9% (1 -exp \u03c1). A feature of the negative exponential specification is that demand elasticities are directly proportional to the relevant policy variables. At the mean values in the data, the elasticity of demand with respect to RPKM was computed to be -0.59, with respect to TKM it was calculated to be 1.21 and with respect to GDP it was found to be 0.29. These values are broadly consistent with those of some other studies with similar formulations (e.g. Whelan et al., 2010) , although compared to other studies, albeit with different formulations, it appeared that he GDP elasticity is somewhat low and, by inference, the TKM elasticity is rather high (see, for example, Wardman, 2006) .

Most of the phases appear to be welfare enhancing, with the exception of the second phase which was dominated by the aftermath of Hatfield and the resultant plethora of management contracts. The latest phase of franchising appears to be particularly welfare enhancing.

Comparable data are not available for the fourth and fifth phases, but the trade press indicate two bids per franchise has become the norm, although there is now a more onerous pre-qualification phase and in some recent competitions there seems to have been only one serious bidder and sometimes, as for South Eastern, not even that. If we assume that the franchisor incurs costs equivalent to one bidder per round, then we estimate these transaction costs as \u00a3800 million in phase one, \u00a3234 million in phase two, \u00a3576 million in phase three and \u00a3350 million in phases four and five (up to mid-2019). This gives total costs of \u00a31.96 billion, based on some 58 franchise competitions (including one cancellation). This does not include the costs associated with dealing with the four franchise failures or the 26 renegotiations and direct awards. Moreover, it does not include the set-up (and shut down) costs of OPRAF, SRA and DfT Rail or the various reviews of franchising. For example, the Public Accounts Committee estimated that the West Coast franchise cancellation resulted in costs of over \u00a350 million. These transactions costs are therefore substantial, running into the billions, but it is unlikely that such costs completely cancel out the welfare benefits of franchising.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 337, "end": 352, "text": "(Preston, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welfare Assessment"}, {"text": "So far in this paper our analysis has been limited to the national rail system.

However, these franchises are very different in terms of the continuity of management, with the East Coast franchise having five changeovers and South West only one, with the East Coast being effectively in public ownership and control from 2009 to 2015 and again from 2018 onwards.

Table 6 indicates that both TOCs underwent similar trends in terms of passenger kms travelled over the first period that the East Coast franchise was nationalised. However, there were marked differences in trends in terms of subsidy per passenger km (or, given these are negative, premium payments per passenger km). Over the period 2009-15, the premium paid by East Coast fluctuated around four pence per passenger kilometre, whilst for South West Trains (SWT) this increased from one pence to six pence per passenger kilometre. For East Coast, mean train loads and receipts per passenger km were also broadly constant over this period, whilst for SWT they were both increasing. This suggest that over this period SWT was more commercially minded than East Coast. Additional analysis of PPM and Cancelled and Significantly Late trains (CaSLs) showed that although SWT generally had better performance than East Coast, the gap narrowed between 2009 and 2015, despite the experiment with virtual integration by SWT between 2012 and 2015 (Alsaedi and Preston, 2019) . It was also found that the complaints per 100,000 passenger journeys decreased over the period for East Coast (albeit from relatively high levels), whilst they increased for SWT. Further, SWT seemed to have a much greater failure rate in meeting the 20 working days response target (Bickel, 2019) . This was also reflected by customer satisfaction as recorded in the National Rail Passenger Survey. 13 For East Coast, satisfaction increased between spring 2011 and spring 2015 from 87% to 94%. Over the same period, customer satisfaction decreased for SWT from 85% to 80%.This suggests that the East Coast franchise may have had a greater social focus over this period. Overall, it is evident that Cowie's notion of consumer sovereignty appears more applicable to East Coast than SWT during this period (Cowie, 2014) .

Furthermore, several franchises appear in financial difficulties.

Arriva and Stagecoach have been disqualified from recent competitions, partly related to disputes over pension contributions, whilst some other mechanisms are being disputed.

In this sense, it is reactive rather than proactive. However, we have long argued that franchising should distinguish between the more commercial and more social franchises.

If a franchising model is adopted, further tweaks might be made in terms of stress testing and risk sharing. For longer distance, commercial services, there may be an argument for these to be taken into national ownership, at least as a temporary measure as investments in electrification, new rolling stock and high-speed services are implemented. This might also involve some unbundling of the longer distance services from the South Eastern, South Western and Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink services.
