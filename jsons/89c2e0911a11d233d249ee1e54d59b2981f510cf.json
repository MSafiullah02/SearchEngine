L'enzyme membranaire ACE2 (enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine 2) sert de r\u00e9cepteur au SRAS COV2, permettant ainsi son entr\u00e9e dans les cellules. Ainsi, la crainte qu'un traitement pr\u00e9existant par IEC ou ARB pourrait augmenter le risque de d\u00e9velopper un syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00e9v\u00e8re en cas d'infection au COVID-19 a \u00e9merg\u00e9. L'ACE2 est une enzyme (carboxypeptidase) qui contribue \u00e0 l'inactivation de l'angiotensine II et, par cons\u00e9quent, s'oppose physiologiquement aux effets de l'angiotensine II. Les IEC n'inhibent pas l'ACE2. Bien qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 in vitro que les ARB r\u00e9gulent positivement l'expression membranaire/l'activit\u00e9 tissulaire de l'ACE2, les \u00e9tudes chez l'Homme ne sont pas concordantes. De plus, \u00e0 ce jour, il n'y a pas de donn\u00e9es pour soutenir l'hypoth\u00e8se qu'un traitement par IEC ou ARB pourrait faciliter l'entr\u00e9e cellulaire du SRAS COV2 en augmentant l'expression membranaire et l'activit\u00e9 tissulaire d'ACE2. Enfin, certaines \u00e9tudes soutiennent l'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l'augmentation de l'expression membranaire d'ACE2, l'administration d'ARB ou l'administration d'ACE 2 soluble circulante pourrait conf\u00e9rer des effets protecteurs potentiels sur la survenue de l\u00e9sions tissulaires inflammatoires s\u00e9v\u00e8res en cas d'infection par le COVID-19. Des essais th\u00e9rapeutiques sont en cours. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, sur la base des preuves actuellement disponibles et comme le pr\u00e9conisent de nombreuses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes, les IEC ou ARB ne doivent pas \u00eatre interrompus en raison d'une infection par le COVID-19 en dehors des situations o\u00f9 la situation h\u00e9modynamique est pr\u00e9caire avec alors un ajustement au cas par cas pr\u00e9conis\u00e9.",

            "text": "With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.",

            "text": "In human physiology, peptides are degraded by a limited number of non-specific extracellular enzymes known as peptidases or proteases. These are membrane proteins, the active sites of which face the extracellular space. Endopeptidases cut within the peptide chain, while exopeptidases release C-or Nterminal amino acids. Angiotensin-converting enzymes are exopeptidases (carboxypeptidases), relatively specific to the amino acids surrounding the cut site, although these may be common to several peptides. It is therefore important to be aware that a given peptidase is not as such specific to a given peptide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme (carboxypeptidase) mainly located in the membrane, circulating forms being created by enzyme splicing of the membrane anchor; it is homologous to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (formerly simply known as ACE but now better denoted ACE1) first described in 2000 (3, 4) . ACE2 downregulates the renin-angiotensin system and acts as a deactivator of angiotensin II (also known as angiotensin-(1-8), an active peptide causing vasoconstriction, pro-fibrosis, pro-inflammation action, stimulating aldosterone secretion by binding to the AT1 receptor), converting it into angiotensin-(1-7), an active peptide with opposite properties to angiotensin II (5) . Several animal studies showed that angiotensin-(1-7), by binding to the Mas receptor, induced vasodilatation and showed anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory properties (6) (Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "Angiotensin II is also deactivated by an aminopeptidase which converts angiotensin II into angiotensin III, which induces vasodilatation and increases natriuresis and bradykinin by preferential binding to AT2 receptors with 30-fold greater affinity than for AT1 receptors (7, 8) . ACE2 also converts angiotensin 1 (also known as angiotensin-(1-10)) into angiotensin-(1-9), of unknown action, which is further converted into angiotensin-(1-7) by ACE1. The RAAS can thus be divided into an \"activator\" system comprising the classical and historical angiotensin II/ACE1/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, and an \"inhibitor\" system comprising the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway, the latter able both to deactivate angiotensin II and counter its effects. The pharmacology of the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway, in contrast to the angiotensin II/ACE1/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, has been little explored, but some in-vitro studies showed beneficial cardiovascular impact when activated, possibly involving GMPc- (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) elevation. ACE2 has also been reported to interact with the angiotensin-1 receptor AT1R, targeted by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). ARBs counter AT1Rmediated effects of angiotensin II, thus stimulating angiotensin II liberation; in response to this increase in angiotensin II, they thus increase ACE2 expression (13) . ACE2 seems to be expressed by the cells of various organs, including heart, kidney, vessels, digestive tract, testicles, ENT region and lung (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Precise identification of the SARS COV2 spike glycoproteins and their ACE2 binding site shows the latter to be identical to that of SARS COV (21) , despite the two viruses being distinct and showing no more than 80% homology.",

The exact roles, however, are complex and may be deleterious in the contamination phase, as ACE2 acts as a receptor to COVID-19 (and severity may correlate with membrane expression and tissue activity) (28, 29) while being beneficial in the inflammatory lesion phase (5, 30) . Many questions thus remain at present unanswered. To our knowledge, there are no pharmacologic ACE2 activators or inhibitors available to date in humans. Some groups suggested using circulating soluble ACE2 to capture as many viruses as possible in plasma, restricting their fixation on cell-membrane ACE2 and thus limiting cell infection. In-vitro studies showed that genetically engineered recombinant soluble ACE2 could be a useful therapeutic option (20, 31) . Moreover, soluble ACE2 might favor the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway over the angiotensin II/ACE/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, preventing or treating severe inflammatory tissue lesions. (14) Human recombinant soluble ACE2 is an FDA-approved treatment since 2013, with a 2017 phase-II trial in acute respiratory distress syndrome (32) , which would allow rapid transfer to COVID-19. A dedicated clinical trial is to be launched soon (NCT04287686).",

Thus the positive or negative impact of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 in humans remains unknown and is complex (44) , possibly even depending on clinical stage: negative in the contamination phase but beneficial in the tissue inflammation phase (45, 46) . Studies of this question are forthcoming (NCT04330300). Early data extracted from a retrospective study performed in China with potential confounders factors exhibited reassuring results with a possible beneficial effect on mortality of ACEis/ARBs.(47) Some authors suggest that ARBs but not ACEis may provide benefit in COVID-19 infection by preventing onset of severe tissue lesions (28, 48) ; two clinical trials of losartan (ARB) in COVID-19, with or without hospital admission, are due to be launched (NCT04312009 and NCT04311177).",

There remains the difficult and unanswered question of long-course ACEi/ARB therapy in case of COVID-19 infection, especially when severe. An individual and personalized attitude seems essential, considering clinical presentation and severity (hemodynamic, respiratory and renal failure, blood pressure, etc.), and the indications for ACEi or ARB (non-complicated hypertension, heart failure with impaired LVEF, etc.).",

It now seems clear that ACE2 is the key point for SARS COV2 cell-entry, and it therefore represents a reasonable pharmacological target. Reducing ACE2 membrane activity and tissue expression, especially in the lung, to prevent infection or reduce severity in patients not or not yet experiencing inflammatory lesions may represent a valuable option. To prevent onset of severe inflammatory tissue lesions, especially in the lung, on the other hand, the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway should be favored to the angiotensin II/ACE/AT1R/aldosterone pathway in order to increase ACE2 membrane expression and/or tissue activity as pharmacological and therapeutic target (e.g., by ARBs). Circulating soluble ACE2 is also a therapeutic option that is actually evaluated. All these questions are currently unresolved and are being scrupulously investigated in ongoing trials.
