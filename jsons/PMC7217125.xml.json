The localizing CT augmented by the edge enhancement revealed additional features that are typical of C-19AP, including vascular enlargement in peripheral distribution, air-bronchograms, and the reverse halo sign (Fig. 2). Conspicuous interlobular and intralobular septal thickening was also present, especially prominent peripherally (Fig. 2A). These findings were typical of C-19AP. Less than an hour after the study completion, an NMP recognized the incidental C-19AP findings and immediately informed the facility's administrator who activated the infection control measures (Fig. 3). The NMP next telephoned the patient but had to leave a message, asking the patient to immediately return the call. After the decontamination of the imaging room, it was closed for 2 hours. Anyone who had contact with the PUI was decontaminated according to the institutional policy.",

She had dyspnea of several days duration that started to improve a few days before the bone scan. When she arrived at our registration desk, she continued to experience an occasional dry cough and generalized mild weakness. The medical office associate at the registration desk asked the screening questions provided by our hospital administration, which at that time included (1) travel to specific countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19, (2) upper respiratory illness in the past 14 days, and (3) a fever. Contemporaneous institutional policy required rescheduling and isolation only if a patient answered affirmatively to all three questions.

It is common at our facility to apply edge enhancement that significantly improved image quality (Figs. 2B\u2013D). Knowledge of typical CT features of C-19AP2,11,12 by NMPs is essential in timely recognition of PUIs. In most states, PUIs must be reported to the Departments of Health.
