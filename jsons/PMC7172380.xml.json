The cyclophilin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression at baseline and at different time points after siRNA transfection was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific for each CYPA, B, C, and D. After these optimization experiments, siRNA stock solutions of 20 \u03bcmol/L were diluted in 50 \u03bcL Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) for a final concentration of 60 nmol/L for CYPA and CYPD siRNA, and 100 nmol/L for CYPC.

This confirmed that each siRNA selectively decreased only targeted cyclophilin mRNA (by approximately 80%), whereas the other cyclophilin (CYPA, CYPC, or CYPD) mRNA expression was comparable with the control (scramble siRNA).

Alisporivir treatment of HBV-transfected HuH-7 cells also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of secreted and intracellular HBV DNA. The most profound reduction was observed after 72 hours of treatment with alisporivir at 5 \u03bcg/mL (58% and 73%, respectively) and 20 \u03bcg/mL (64% and 58%, respectively) (Figure 1\nC and D). Overall, the alisporivir antiviral activity was greater in transiently transfected HuH-7 cells in comparison with stably transfected HepG2215 cells (P = .038 for secreted HBV DNA and P < .001 for cytoplasmic HBV DNA). As stated earlier, alisporivir at 5 \u03bcg/mL reduced intracellular HBV-DNA levels by 73% and 58% in HuH-7 and HepG2215 cells, respectively, after 72 hours of treatment (Figure 1\nB and D). This difference was even more apparent at earlier time points. After 24 hours, the intracellular HBV-DNA reduction in HepG2215 cells and HuH-7 cells was 16% and 64%, respectively (Figure 1\nB and D). Importantly, the Southern blot analysis of intracellular DNA supports the quantitative real-time PCR results outlined earlier because alisporivir reduced intracellular HBV DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1\nE).",

The secreted HBV DNA was reduced by 50% in these cells in comparison with normal HuH-7 cells (Figure 4\nA), and adding alisporivir had only a marginal effect. Intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA was affected even more in this cell line with a 90% reduction (Figure 4\nB). Secreted HBsAg also was reduced significantly (90%) whereas intracellular HBsAg accumulated in these cells (Figure 4\nC and D). Interestingly, treatment of the CYPA KD cells with alisporivir (20 \u03bcg/mL) profoundly decreased intracellular HBsAg levels. In CYPC-silenced cells, secreted and intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA were reduced by 61% and 93%, respectively, compared with negative controls (Figure 5\nA and B) and HBsAg levels were reduced by 30% (Figure 5\nC). The result of silencing CYPD was similar to silencing CYPC-as secreted and intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA and sHBsAg, which were reduced by 62%, 96%, and 30%, respectively (Figure 5\nD\u2013F). CYPA silencing with siRNA resulted in a greater reduction in secreted HBV DNA and sHBsAg compared with siRNA silencing of CYPC or CYPD. As stated earlier, at 72 hours treatment, the silencing of CYPA reduced secreted HBV DNA by 80% (Figure 3\nA) compared with 60% in CYPC or CYPD-silenced cells (Figure 5\nA and D). At the same time point, sHBsAg was reduced by 65% (Figure 3\nC) compared with 30% in CYPC or CYPD silenced cells (Figures 5\nC and F, respectively). Interestingly, adding alisporivir to CYPC and CYPD-silenced cells further reduced the 3 viral parameters measured (Figure 5). This increased effect in the presence of alisporivir was seen only when the levels of secreted and intracellular DNA as well as sHBsAg were still increased in the cyclophilin-silenced cells such as at 24 hours for intracellular nucleocapsid-associated DNA and 48 and 72 hours for sHBsAg. This additional effect of alisporivir, however, disappeared when the levels of secreted and intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA became very low in cyclophilin-silenced cells.",

            "text": "HBV is the smallest human DNA virus with a unique genomic organization and replication mechanism.23 Viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes with 3 subsets of HBV-RNA transcripts: pregenomic RNA, envelope preS/S RNAs, and HBx mRNA, encoding all structural and nonstructural viral proteins. Characteristic of HBV infection are the spheric and filamentous subviral particles composed exclusively of viral envelope proteins and host-derived lipids, which are produced 103- to 106-fold in excess to full virions and secreted from hepatocytes.23 By using 3 different in vitro HBV models: stably transfected (HepG2215), transiently transfected (HuH-7), and HBV-infected (HepaRG) cells, the present study shows that cellular cyclophilins have a major role in the HBV life cycle in hepatocytes. Blocking cyclophilins\u2019 enzymatic activity with small molecules, alisporivir or NIM811, or the selective silencing of individual cyclophilins with siRNA, markedly reduced HBV-DNA replication, as well as HBsAg production and secretion from cells. CYPA is one of the most abundant cytosolic proteins (approximately 0.1% of cell proteins)2 and the present study shows the major utilization of cyclophilin A both in HBV replication and in HBV envelope protein secretion from hepatocytes. The experiments using HuH-7 cells with stable CYPA KD, and the findings that ALV enhanced HBV DNA and HBsAg reduction in CYPC and CYPD-silenced cells show that CYPA is important for the formation of intracellular, nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA and viral secretion, as well as for HBsAg secretion from cells. The quantitation of intracellular CYPA showed a greater amount in HuH-7 than in HepG2215 cells, which is the likely explanation for the much greater effect of alisporivir on HBsAg secretion from HuH-7 compared with HepG2215 cells. Importantly, cyclophilin inhibitors, such as alisporivir and NIM811, block all cellular cyclophilins and in HepG2215 cells there was a dose-dependent reduction in HBV DNA. The data thus suggest that, in this model, the antiviral effect was primarily a result of alisporivir and NIM811 targeting other cyclophilins (eg, CYPD and/or CYPC), leading to the observed HBV-DNA reduction in these cells.",

            "text": "The results from the present study together with previously published data indicate that the mechanisms by which alisporivir and NIM811 impact HBV replication and HBsAg production are likely to involve interference at multiple sites of the HBV life cycle. First, the finding that cyclophilin inhibition reduces intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA in the cytoplasm suggests an antiviral effect on the production of new virions and a reduction in the recirculation of HBV nucleocapsids from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which is a key mechanism to replenish the viral template. We found a marked reduction of intracellular HBV DNA in cells with stable CYPA KD, along with intracellular HBsAg accumulation. Previous studies have shown the intracellular interaction between CYPA and HBsAg and their close association during secretion from liver cells.24 Thus, cyclophilin inhibitors will disrupt the CYPA/HBsAg complex and reduce envelope protein secretion. Second, Hepatitis B x Antigen (HBxAg), which is essential for HBV replication, associates with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and by regulating cytosolic calcium and signaling it drives HBV replication.25, 26, 27 NIM811 was shown to block cytosolic calcium signaling and the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a result of its inhibition of CYPD.28 Therefore, blocking CYPD interferes with HBxAg regulation of calcium and will impact HBV replication negatively. Third, CYPA is an important co-factor for lipids and apolipoprotein B (apoB) trafficking and NIM811 was shown to decrease apoB secretion, as well as the egress of HCV particles from JFH1\u2013HCV\u2013infected cells.13 Because cellular lipids are part of the HBV envelope proteins, the impact of cyclophilin inhibition on apoB secretion is likely to interfere with the intracellular formation and secretion of lipoproteins part of HBV viral and subviral particles. Fourth, recent findings have shown that the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, a membrane bile acid transporter expressed in the liver, is a functional receptor for HBV and hepatitis Delta virus, via pre-S1 binding.29, 30 Moreover, cyclosporin A and nonimmunosuppressive analogues, such as alisporivir, recently were shown to inhibit HBV entry into cells by blocking the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, which is a cyclophilin-independent mechanism.31, 32\n",

HBsAg is the hallmark of HBV infection and HBsAg loss, with or without seroconversion to antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, is the ideal treatment end point, is associated with improved long-term outcome,33, 34, 35 shows markedly enhanced antiviral T-cell reactivity,36 and it allows therapy to be stopped with a minimal risk of relapse. Although the nucleos(t)ide polymerase antivirals are potent inhibitors of HBV replication and result in a profound reduction of circulating HBV, they have little effect on HBsAg transcription/subviral particle production. HBsAg loss has been reported to occur in 2%\u20138% of HBeAg-positive patients and in 0%\u20135% of HBeAg-negative patients after 3\u20135 years of continuous treatment.33, 37 The clinical implication of the present study is that it provides in vitro evidence supporting a new therapeutic approach in chronic hepatitis B with a combination of a direct antiviral agent (such as the HBV-DNA polymerase inhibitors) with a host-targeting antiviral (such as alisporivir), which is likely to increase the rate of HBsAg clearance. Alisporivir is a host-targeting antiviral agent currently in development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Analyses of the clinical database, involving more than 2000 patients, show that alisporivir is well tolerated and has a markedly better safety profile when given as interferon-free treatment than with interferon-containing treatment.38 A combination treatment with an HBV nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitor plus alisporivir could be beneficial because of the interference at multiple sites of the HBV life cycle, especially the additional effects in reducing HBsAg production and secretion, plus blocking HBV entry into noninfected hepatocytes. In the present study, the combination of alisporivir plus telbivudine showed greater impact on HBsAg and supports the potential utility of this combination, which deserves to be tested in clinical studies.",
