On returning home to Singapore, Taiwan, Toronto, and Vietnam, they transmitted the pathogen causing the disease, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to local residents. Global spread of this hitherto unknown pathogen led WHO to issue travel advisories and some national health authorities to quarantine travelers from affected areas. As subsequent infections were largely nosocomial, hospital infection-control procedures were increasingly enforced. Absent knowledge of the onset of infectiousness, local authorities also quarantined community contacts.",

Isolating people with symptoms that may herald disease, especially if they might have been exposed to someone since diagnosed, would be more efficient. Impact is proportional to the product of efficiency and efficacy, which must exceed 1-1/\u211c0 for control, where \u211c0 is the average number of sufficiently intimate contacts for transmission while infectious. Consequently, infected people must be highly infectious or infectious long before becoming ill for quarantine to be a better strategy than simply encouraging those with early symptoms to seek care and ensuring their proper disposition.",

In Singapore and Beijing, 38 and 13 contacts per probable case were restricted, respectively (Tan, 2005; Pang et al., 2003).

We chose A values of 2, 2, and 3 (i.e., assumed the variance of \u03b2E and \u03b2P exceed that of \u03b2R), so the B values are 0.0242, 0.1522, and 0.5823.

The potential impact of quarantine has been so regularly confused with its actual contribution to SARS\u2019 control that one wonders if this longtime staple of public health (McNeill, 1977; Rosner, 1995) has been rigorously evaluated before. Day et al. (2006) refine Fraser et al.'s (2004) conditions for quarantine to be effective: the number of asymptomatic infections and fraction preventable\u2014essentially the number of pre-symptomatic infections\u2014must be large and the probability of infected individuals being quarantined high. Short of everyone staying home after a household member becomes ill, the last condition will be difficult to meet for respiratory diseases.",

If patients could be infectious before developing symptoms, quarantine must be considered. But identifying people whose contacts were sufficiently intimate for infection is extremely difficult, especially given uncertainty about the mode of transmission. The gain in efficiency\u2014by ensuring instead that people with early signs and symptoms seek medical care, clinicians diagnose, and infection-control personnel isolate them effectively\u2014may more than compensate for any loss of efficacy due to infections during the prodrome. Modeling can help to determine this distribution and, conditional on that essential information, to evaluate the relative impact of various possible public health interventions.",
