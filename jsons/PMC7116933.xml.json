Many studies have utilized MWs to inactivate microorganisms in liquids [5], solids [6], and food [7]. Only a few studies on airborne microbes have been conducted [8,9].\u00b7 Hamid et al. reported preliminary results of MW on airborne fungi, yeast and bacteria in food processing plants [10]. Zhang et al. utilized microwave assisted nanofibrous air filter to disinfect airborne E. coli cells and B. subtilis endospores [11]. These results indicate that MW irradiation is a promise technology for airborne microbial inactivation. Microbial inactivation through MW irradiation results from the denaturation of enzymes, proteins, and membranes, and disruption of cellular metabolic activities [12]. However, intracellular substances are released when cells in bioaerosol are damaged or destroyed [13]. The released intracellular substances and small membrane fragments may penetrate tissue sites (alveolar membrane and capillary wall) that are ordinarily not penetrable by bacteria.",

They are widely distributed in the outer cell-wall membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and other microorganisms [14]. A few previous studies observed the associated waterborne endotoxins release during inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria [15] and intestinal epithelium [16]. These results suggest that the embeded endotoxins can be released into environments after the death of bacteria or cells. Airborne endotoxins are present in the air in two main forms. The first corresponds to pure LPS molecules (free endotoxins). The second form corresponds to LPSs associated with other cell wall components or an intact bacterial cell (bound endotoxins) [17]. Chronic exposure to endotoxins can induce and exacerbate airway symptoms [18], such as asthma, coughing, and respiratory diseases (e.g. toxic pneumonitis, airway obstructions) [19,20]. However, endotoxins release from airborne bacteria under MW irradiation has not been reported.",

Only a few studies have been conducted on the degradation of waterborne endotoxins [21,22]. Conventional oxidative processes employing free chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, and ozone have been ineffective in waterborne endotoxin degradation [22]. Some AOPs (O3/H2O2 and UV/H2O2) were able to effectively oxidize the waterborne endotoxins, which were induced by the hydroxyl radicals [21]. However, the application of AOP technologies is complicated by the extinction of active radicals and inefficient mass transfer process in air.

Total endotoxins comprise free and bound endotoxins. The total endotoxin concentration was detected following sample pretreatment through ultrasonic extraction (800 W, 20 kHz, 10 min) [25], which directly increases endotoxin concentration by breaking up cells and allowing LPS release. The free, bound, and total endotoxin concentrations of samples before and after MW irradiation were measured. Each measurement for airborne endotoxins was repeated thrice, and the average value was taken as the final data.",

A control experiment without MW irradiation showed no antibacterial effect (Support information, Fig. S4), indicating that MW has a role in inactivation. MW irradiation exhibited a rapid reduction of airborne E. coli, and the highest removal efficiency (E, calculated by Eq. (2)) could reached 4.1-log reduction in 20 s (Fig. 1A). Previous studies on MW application in waterborne microbe disinfection showed that several minutes were often required to achieve satisfactory inactivation performance [31,32]. In this study, the fast inactivation performance under short exposure time compared with previous reports on waterborne cases, which adds to the data on the potential suitability of MW as an anti-bioaerosol technology. Increasing the irradiation time (Fig. 1A) and input energy density (Fig. 1B) of MW can promote the inactivation of airborne bacteria. The experimental data in Fig. 1 demonstrated a linear decrease in survival logarithmic E. coli concentrations with irradiation time. These results suggested that the inactivation reactions of airborne E. coli. followed the first-order kinetics. Such microbial inactivation rate laws or kinetic models were often reported in previous studies [33].",

Green fluorescence, which is emitted by AO dye (Fig. 2A and B), represents intact cells. The intensity of green fluorescence decreased (Fig. 2E) after MW irradiation because a great proportion of E. coli cells were inactivated by MW irradiation. However, the intensity of orange fluorescence (Fig. 2C and D), which represents injuried cells, significantly increased (Fig. 2F). This result indicated that MW exposure significantly increased the proportion of cells with ruptured membranes. Similar finding was observed by Wu et al. [8] that the microwave-irradiated P. fluorescens cells apparently had damaged membrane envelope as observed in the SEM images. Previous researches showed that MW can alter enzymatic activities by disrupting weak bonds in active protein forms [38], and produce reactive oxygen species (such as \u2022OH) [37], which was used to damage membrane envelope. The SEM images of E. coli cells before and after MW irradiation (Fig. 3\n) confirmed that the cells were damaged and ruptured after MW irradiation. Given that E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium, which possess a thinner membrane layer than Gram-positive bacterium, its cell membrane is easily damaged. The results obtained in this study provided evidence that airborne bacterial cells are lysed during MW irradiation, suggesting that cell membrane damage is a crucial mechanism of bacterial inactivation through MW irradiation. Similar results were reported by Woo et al [39]. It was found that untreated E. coli cells had a smooth surface, while most of the microwave-radiated cells exhibited severe destruction. The surfaces of the microwave-heated cells were damaged and had become rough and swollen.",

Although ultrasonic extraction technique was used to break up cells and release free LPS into the reaction medium in this study, the LAL method would underestimate the actual amount of endotoxins in air samples. Because the free LPS can agglutinate and form structures with higher molecular weight in aqueous solutions [42], which can not be detected by LAL assay. Rylander et al. reported that the toxicity of inhaled endotoxin is high when the endotoxins are bound [43].

The results showed that MW irradiation at 40 \u00b0C could not degrade airborne endotoxins, because the energy of a MW photon is about 10\u22125 eV (2.45 GHz), which is much lower than the covalent bonds energy of C\u2014C (3.82 eV) and C\u2014H (4.51 eV). However, MW irradiation at 100 \u00b0C and sole thermal heating conditions presented remarkable and similar degradation performance. This result suggested that thermal effect was likely to be the dominant mechanism for airborne endotoxins degradation. The present study proved that MW irradiation likely degrades endotoxins by exerting thermal effects, which is an effective alternative method for airborne endotoxins removal.",

These processes suffer from the limitations of harsh conditions with excess of chlorine used in the process and unsatisfactory results. In this study, microwave assisted heating demonstrated a rapid and effective degradation of airborne endotoxins.

Generally, when endotoxins degradation is a first-order reaction, its kinetics are expressed as follows:(3)\u222bc0cdcc=\u222b0t\u2212kdt\n(4)lnc=lnc0\u2212ktwhere k is a reaction constant, t is reaction time, c and c\n0 is the endotoxin concentration at time of t and 0, respectively.

This result indicated that the endotoxin degradation followed a first-order reaction, which has a rate law in which the sum of the exponents is equal to 1. Recall that an integrated rate law gives the relationship between endotoxin concentration and time. Eq. (4) predicts that the concentration of airborne endotoxin will decrease in a smooth exponential curve over time. Knowing the rate constant for the decay of airborne endotoxin enables engineers to design reactors to achieve the desired inactivation efficiency. The degradation rate constants for airborne endotoxin was calcluated as 0.008 s\u22121. This result implies that the rate of bioaerosol inactivation is very high, whereas the endotoxin degradation rate is much slower. Some other literatures reported the degradation of endotoxins in water phase using AOPs (O3/H2O2 and UV/H2O2) [21] and photocatalysis [33] technologies. Longer exposure time (several minutes or hours) compared with this study were often used to degrade the low concentrations of endotoxins (less than 0.5 EU/l) [21,33].",

Airborne bacterial cells are lysed during MW irradiation. Cell lysis significantly increases the proportion of cells with ruptured membranes. MW irradiation sharply decreased bound endotoxin concentration from 230 EU/m3 to 68 EU/m3 and increased free endotoxin concentration from 21 EU/m3 to 122 EU/m3 because endotoxins are released from bacterial cells into the atmosphere. MW irradiation likely degrades endotoxins by exerting thermal effects and can achieve an endotoxin removal efficiency of as high as 35%. The analysis of the kinetics and thermodynamics of endotoxin removal showed that endotoxin degradation follows a first-order reaction and requires the activation energy of 26.3 kJ/mol. The results of this study mainly focus a particular Gram-negative bacteria of E. coli. And further investigations about the airborne endotoxins associated with other microbes still need to be conducted.",
