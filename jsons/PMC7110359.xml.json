Then, a likelihood model was fitted to this initial tree and the parameters were re\u2010estimated in order to obtain the optimal tree; the procedure was repeated until the likelihood values remained constant. The estimated parameters from the data sets included the Ts/Tv, the pyrimidine/purine transition ratio, the proportion of invariant sites and the \u03b1 shape parameter of the \u03b3 distribution (with eight categories). A final neighbor\u2010joining tree was constructed using the estimated model parameters and the HKY85 evolution model. The trees generated with several evolution models were compared and the reliability of the phylogenetic trees obtained was evaluated by running 1000 replicates in the bootstrap test [23].

            "text": "The theoretical concept of quasispecies was first described by Eigen [6] and Eigen et al. [26], and has been demonstrated to be suitable for describing the behaviour of the RNA virus at the molecular level. The quasispecies structure of some RNA viruses has remarkable biological implications because, during viral replication, dynamic mutants with considerable adaptability are continuously generated. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is one of the most dramatic examples of viral quasispecies, but similar observations have been made for many virus populations [27]. In coronaviruses, the genomic complexity and the quasispecies nature have been well documented mainly for the murine hepatitis virus, the study model of the genus [28]. Some studies have demonstrated that FCoVs can also consist of a complex of heterogeneous variants in vivo and in vitro [[13], [29]]. The main purpose of this study was to understand the heterogeneity of FCoVs in vivo analysing the genomic complexity of strains from both healthy and sick cats. The quasispecies composition of FCoVs was evaluated in SSCP analysis by testing PCR fragments from the N and ORF7b regions. The SSCP assay has been shown to be a reliable tool for evaluating the heterogeneity of RNA viruses; for each lane, the number of bands visible after electrophoresis of the amplicons is proportional to the number of viral subpopulations included in a given sample. We also analysed the viral tissue distribution in the sick cats. In cat 419, the virus was seen in the following organs: kidneys, spleen, brain cortex and large intestine, while in cat 420, we detected the viruses in all the organs analysed except the brain cortex and the lungs; in cat 453, the viruses were distributed in the pericardium, lungs and liver (Table 1). Cats with FIP demonstrated more variability in their SSCP patterns than healthy ones. Our anamnestic data supported the hypothesis that cat 419 and cat 420 became infected by contact with carrier cats and the same viral strain evolved differently within the diseased animals acquiring more genetic complexity. Our results showed that quasispecies composition differs between organs in the same cat and the heterogeneity of the FCoV genome was correlated with the seriousness of the clinical forms and the lesions of the organs. In fact, the highest variability in SSCP patterns was observed in cat 420 affected by systemic FIP and this was more obvious in its seriously degenerated liver and lymph nodes. The viral tissue distributions as well the genomic complexity were consistent with the seriousness of the disease, as proven by a higher distribution of the viruses in cat 420. These results confirm the biological relevance of the quasispecies; the high mutation rate of coronaviruses contributes to their rapid evolution with the selection of new variants [30]. In some cases the new variants can escape from the immune system and are more advantageous giving rise to more serious lesions such as those observed in the liver of cat 420. Higher variability was observed in the sick cats with acute disease, but, in contrast, more homogeneity was observed in the healthy cats with persistent infection. The two genomic regions analysed in this study showed different levels of variation. The N region demonstrated a stronger heterogeneity as compared to ORF7b, as has previously been described by other authors [13]. The limited presence of quasispecies was seen in the ORF7b region and the SSCP patterns were similar for most samples examined. In contrast, higher variability was seen in the N region both in the same cat and between different cats (t=\u22123.0866; P=0.006; Table 2).",

The graphs showed a linear correlation for transitions and transversions over the entire range of divergence. On the other hand, to visualise noise in each data set sequence, we performed a likelihood mapping analysis using the TREE PUZZLE program. 20.2 and 14.4% of the random quartets for the N and the ORF7b region, respectively, fell in the centre of the triangle which represents a star\u2010like phylogeny (Fig. 2); this implies that the alignments gave a completely resolved phylogeny only in certain parts of the tree. Most of the dots in both alignments (76.6% for N and 80% for ORF7b) were equally distributed in the three corners of the triangle representing well\u2010resolved phylogeny.",

This is in contrast with other reports which revealed a strict correlation between different biotypes from the same geographic background [4]. In fact, in our study, the virulent strains 420 and FIPV\u2010791146 were shown to be closely related despite their different geographical origin. This theory is confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the ORF7b sequences. In fact, in spite of different geographic origins, virulent strains 419, 420 and 453 belong to the same cluster supported by a high statistical value. Furthermore, the percentage of similarity between different biotypes from the same area was shown to be lower than those of the same biotype from different areas.",
