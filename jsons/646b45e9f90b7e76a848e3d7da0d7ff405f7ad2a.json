Chemokines constitute a group of bioactive peptides that regulate leukocyte migration and also contribute to activation of these cells. Chemokines are essential mediators of inflammation and important for control of viral infections. The profile of chemokine expression contributes to shaping the immune response during viral infection, whereas viral subversion of the chemokine system allows the virus to evade antiviral activities of the host. In this review, we discuss the role of chemokines in host-defense against virus infections, and we also look deeper into the virus-cell interactions that trigger chemokine expression as well as the cellular signaling cascades involved.

This induction occurs within a few hours of the infection, and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 has a number of antiviral functions [1] . First, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 directly induces antiviral activities in the uninfected, neighboring cells. This prevents viral spread by increasing the resistance of uninfected cells toward the virus. Second, IFNs can activate natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxity toward virus-infected cells [2, 3] . Third, there is accumulating evidence that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 contributes to driving the adaptive-immune response in the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) direction via stimulation of IFN-\u2425 expression [4, 5] .",

Macrophages participate in the antiviral response through production of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines [8] as well as by working as an antigen-presenting cell (APC). It is also possible that macro-phages contribute to antiviral defense via phagocytosis of extracellular virus and infected apoptotic cells [7] . Dendritic cells (DCs) also participate in the antiviral response through several mechanisms [9] . First, DCs are probably the main APC, thus playing a pivotal role in development and maturation of the specific immune response. Second, this cell type participates in coordinating the inflammatory response, through production of cytokines and chemokines (see below). In particular, cells of the DC lineage have recently been shown to represent the main source of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 during viral infections [10, 11] .",

First, in the tissue, chemokines can bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix or on the surface of cells. As the chemokines retain their chemotactic activity during this binding, they establish a concentration gradient contributing to the attraction of leukocytes [18] . Second, chemokines can bind to the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), expressed on erythrocytes and endothelial cells. DARC can bind CC as well as CXC chemokines and may function as a sink, clearing chemokines from the circulation [18] . A third chemokine-binding protein is D6, which binds CC chemokines but not C, CXC, or CX 3 C chemokines [24] . The function of this receptor, which is expressed on many cell types within and without the hemopoietic system, remains to be understood in detail.",

Although most of this work has been done in vitro, a substantial body of information about chemokine expression in vivo is now available. Table 1 summarizes the data on chemokine expression during viral infection in humans as well as in experimental animals. From the available data, it appears that expression of CC chemokines dominates over the expression of CXC chemokines during viral infections. Among the CC chemokines, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u2423 and CCL5/ regulated upon activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) seem to be almost invariably associated with viral infections, with some interesting exceptions. For instance, during an intranasal influenza virus infection in mice, only CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and CXCL10/IFN-\u2425inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10) were detected in the lungs at various time-points post-infection, whereas other chemokines including CCL3 and CCL5 were not expressed [36] . By comparison, RSV-infected mice display high levels of expression of numerous chemokines in the lungs, including CCL3 and CCL5 [38] . This observation in mice correlates very well with the results of a comparative study in pediatric patients infected with RSV and influenza virus [45] . Although serum levels of CCL5 were very high in RSV-infected children, this was not the case in influenza virus-infected patients. This difference in chemokine response to these two viruses may be explained by the ability of influenza virus to inhibit various activities of the immune response, in particular the production and activity of IFNs [46] .",

Given the strong activity of this receptor as mediator of T cell recruitment, expression of the non-ELR CXC chemokines may be central for mounting an efficient antiviral response. This idea is supported by the finding of a statistically significant association between intrahepatic expression of CXCL9 and the inflammatory activity of chronic hepatitis C [35] .

Moreover, although the virus was rapidly cleared from the lungs, CCL5 protein was present up to 1 month after the infection.

Conversely, lack of CCR1 does not affect the ability to clear RSV infections, despite high production of the CCR1 ligand CCL3 [53] . Also, mice deficient in CCL3 exhibit delayed viral clearance when infected with influenza virus, PVM, or MCMV [32, 52, 56] . In an impressive series of studies, Biron and colleagues [32, 33, 61] described the leukocyte-cytokine/ chemokine interactions responsible for the antiviral activity of CCL3 in the liver. They identified IFN-\u2423/\u2424 as the main inducer of CCL3 expression, which in turn, triggered recruitment of NK cells. This cell type subsequently produced IFN-\u2425, which was then responsible for induction of expression of CXCL9, a chemokine mediating chemotaxis toward T cells [32, 33, 61] . Collectively, the studies discussed above indicate that CCR1 and its ligands are necessary to raise a sufficient immune response against many viruses. In other viral infections, however, CCL3 has been found not to be important for viral clearance. For instance, lack of CCL3 does not affect viral titers after intraperitoneal Coxsackie B3 virus infection, intranasal RSV infection, and ocular HSV-1 infection [38, 56, 57] .

From Table 1 and the discussion in the text, it is apparent that among the chemokines produced during viral infection, notably, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed. Among these, CCL5 is the most studied with respect to molecular mechanisms governing virus-induced chemokine expression. Therefore, the discussion below focuses mainly on CCL5, but we will provide information on other chemokines when available. First, we review the basic principles in virus-cell interactions and virus-activated cellular signal transduction, and subsequently, we discuss the literature on molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of chemokine expression during virus infection.",

Third, overload of viral proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as virus-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress triggers release of calcium from the organelles, which activate kinase cascades, ultimately leading to expression of proinflammatory genes (ref. [69] ; and T. H. Mogensen et al., J. Immunol. in press). Finally, some viral proteins have the capacity to specifically activate certain signal-transduction pathways in infected cells [70] . Although it may not seem beneficial for the virus to deliberately activate signal transduction that promotes antiviral defense, the virus may profit from this by stimulating chemokine expression and hence promote recruitment of new cells to infect, which may subsequently relocate and hence support viral spread in the body [71] . Additionally, some viruses harbor sequences in their gene promoters that are recognized by transcription factors, specifically activated by viral proteins [72] . In the literature, each of the above mechanisms has been reported to activate signaltransduction pathways necessary for cytokine and chemokine production [73] . To illustrate the above principles, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein gp350 induces expression of CXCL8 and CCL3 in human neutrophils [74] . This viral glycoprotein uses the cellular surface protein CD21 as receptor and triggers intracellular signaling [75] . Although neutrophils are not the main target for EBV, this finding does demonstrate that gp350 is capable of inducing chemokine expression. Another EBV protein, latent membrane protein 1, which is produced in certain stages of EBV latency and is required for transformation of infected cells, is also able to induce expression of certain chemokines [76] .",

Like NF-B, the two IRFs require post-translational modification to become activated. Following infection, IRF-3 and IRF-7 are serine/threonine-phosphosphorylated by a kinase, VAK, allowing the proteins to adapt a conformation compatible with homoor heterodimerization. The dimers migrate to the nucleus and activate transcription. There is evidence that IRF-3 and IRF-7 play important roles in virus-induced expression of the cytokine IFN-\u2423/\u2424 [79] as well as CCL5 [80] (see below).

Subsequently, this observation has been demonstrated also to apply to HSVinduced CCL5 expression (J. Melchjorsen and S. R. Paludan, J. Gen. Virol. in press). The ability of NF-B to act synergistically with IRFs in stimulation of promoter activation has long been appreciated [103] .

In fact, as for CCL5, these elements play important roles in regulation of CXCL10 expression during virus infection as well as in response to cytokines [104 -108] . Analysis of the CXCL10 promoter showed that infection with measles virus, NDV, and Sendai virus as well as treatment with dsRNA lead to activation of the wild-type promoter and that this activation is dependent on the region of the promoter encompassing the ISRE and the distal B site [106, 107] . As these findings were done before the identification of IRF-3 and IRF-7 as the main virus-activated IRFs, it was not demonstrated which IRF family member is responsible for the ISREdependent CXCL10 transcription. However, more recent work has indicated that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are involved, given the correlation between hantavirus-induced activation of these two transcription factors and expression of CXCL10 [105] . In the same study, cooperation between IRFs and NF-B was again reported, and this cooperation was found to be enhanced in magnitude and duration by cotreatment with IFN-\u2425.",

ATFs and Jun have previously been identified to promote expression of CCL5 in response to RSV infection as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [92, 111] .

The authors showed that overexpression of the N protein led to activation of the IRF-3 kinase, VAK, and subsequent phosphorylation of IRF-3. Moreover, the N protein associated with IRF-3 as well as VAK, thus indicating that IRF-3 or an IRF-3-containing protein complex is able to recognize the N protein and transduce this signal to VAK, which in turn, activates IRF-3. The ability of capsid proteins to activate IRF-3 appears not to be specific to papamyxoviruses, as the capsid protein of the flavivirus West Nile virus also induces expression of CCL5 [118] , thus strongly indicating activation of IRF-3. Moreover, HSV-1 has been shown to activate IRF-3 in different human cell lines through a mechanism dependent on viral entry but independent of de novo transcription of viral or cellular genes [119] , again pointing toward a mechanism involving viral capsid proteins.",

Even highly related viruses may use different mechanisms to activate IRF-3. Krug and associates [122] have compared the ability of influenza A and B viruses with respect to activation of IRF-3 and found that the ability of influenza A virus to activate IRF-3 is sensitive to UV treatment of the virus, whereas that of influenza B virus is not.

First, the RNA accumulates intracellularly and activates PKR, which in turn, activates the signal transduction leading to degradation of IB and activation of NF-B [67] . Second, dsRNA, in intracellular compartments or extracellularly after release from lysed cells, binds to TLR3 and thus activates NF-B [68] . Studies from this laboratory have shown that HSV infection of macrophages triggers expression of CCL5 and that this relies on PKR, NF-B, and viral-infected cell protein 0 (ref. [123] ; and J. Melchjorsen and S. R. Paludan, J. Gen. Virol., in press). Subsequent studies have identified the mechanism of NF-B activation by HSV to include mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent calcium release from this organelle (Mogensen et al., submitted). The laboratory of Dr. Muruve [90, 104] has studied the virus-cell interactions responsible for NF-B-dependent expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 during adenovirus infection. They found that activation of NF-B was mediated by the viral capsid and was dependent on viral entry. Together, these studies show that many different mechanisms contribute to activation of NF-B during viral infections, an essential factor in virus-induced chemokine expression.",

Virus can also activate p38 through dsRNA-independent mechanisms.

            "text": "Analysis of the CCL5 promoter reveals at least two additional transcription factor-binding sites potentially involved in regulation of chemokine expression during viral infection, although no direct evidence has been provided yet. First, the GAS element, known to be highly active in response to IFN-\u2425 [128] , may be activated by homodimers of STAT1 formed in response to IFN-\u2423/\u2424, which has been shown to stimulate expression of several chemokines [104] . Second, NF-AT is activated during infections with human T lymphotropic virus type 1 and Sendai virus and probably many more [129, 130] . The presence of a NF-AT-binding site in the CCL5 promoter therefore opens up the possibility that this transcription factor might also play a role in virus-induced CCL5 expression. At this point, it is appropriate to mention that in addition to direct virus-induced chemokine expression, cytokines expressed during the course of infection contribute substantially to stimulation of chemokine production, notably at later stages of infection after the initial virus-host interaction. Therefore, promoter elements not directly targeted by virus-activated transcription factors may still contribute to chemokine production during infection. One study by Matikainen et al. [97] showed that influenza A virus infection of human monocytes triggered expression of a number of chemokines, some of which (CCL2, CCL7, and CXCL10) were dependent on intermediary IFN-\u2423/\u2424 expression. Biron and colleagues [61] also found a role for IFN-\u2423/\u2424 in virus-induced chemokine expression in the MCMV model, where the authors demonstrated that expression of CCL3 in the liver was induced by type I IFN.",

More recently, chemokines have been ascribed multiple functions, most notably leukocyte activation. Given these properties, it is of little surprise that chemokines contribute significantly to the ability of the organism to mount a proinflammatory response and fight infections. The latter is underscored by the fact that many viruses encode proteins that antagonize chemokine function.",

Investigations of the molecular events that occur during the clinch between the virus and the host cell have revealed that a wealth of mechanisms is involved. These include interactions between viral glycoproteins and cellular surface receptors; accumulation of viral dsRNA, which is sensed by the cell by various mechanisms; cellular stress through protein overload of the endoplasmatic reticulum or production of reactive oxygen intermediated from the mitochondria; and intracellular accumulation of viral proteins that interact with cellular signal transduction.",

The available data seem to support the conclusion that Th1-promoting chemokine receptors and their ligands support viral clearance and in some cases, immunopathology. However, the great degree of redundancy in the chemokine system makes it difficult to predict the role of one specific chemokine or chemokine receptor during infection and hence, emphasizes the importance of thorough experimentation. With the present focus on chemokine receptor antagonists as potential treatment against HIV infections and chronic inflammatory diseases, it is important to fully understand the role of these receptors in defense against infections. Moreover, in-depth understanding of the chemokine system may in turn allow development of vaccines and immunostimulatory drugs as treatment against virus infections in immunocompromised hosts prone to opportunistic infections.
