Salvi et al. ( 1994 ) are the pioneers of gene transfer studies in Spirulina and concluded that identifi cation of a suitable restriction modifi cation system can accelerate the progress in this direction. Kaneko et al. ( 1996 ) sequenced the whole genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a unicellular cyanobacterium which was followed by whole genome sequencing over 40 strains of cyanobacteria. Some nitrogen-fi xing fi lamentous species, and some unicellular species, which are either nitrogen fi xing or non-nitrogen fi xing are to name among them. Only recently in 2010 , Fujisawa et al. fi rst sequenced the fi lamentous non-nitrogen-fi xing species viz, A. platensis .",

            "text": "Sequencing of whole genome opened up the way to use genes from higher plants as probes (Amao and Nakamura, 2006 ) to identify and clone cyanobacterial genes involved in photosynthesis. Subsequently, many cyanobacterial photosynthetic mutants were possible to create by genetic manipulations conducted by Ruengjitchatchawalya et al. ( 2002 ) and Cao et al. ( 1999 ) . They created some genetically engineered strains which can effi ciently produce organic substances. One advantage of cyanobacteria is that they use solar energy, CO 2 , H 2 O and inorganic substances as effi ciently as higher plants. This feature can be exploited for production of useful organic products with minimum expenditure of resources and energy. A few decades ago Kuhlemeier et al. ( 1981 ) reported some expression vectors for Anacystis nidulans R2. Later, Kurdrid et al. ( 2011 ) developed cyanobacterial host vector systems to analyze the expression and structure function relation of the genes. One major advantage of Spirulina is its simpler growth requirements than other bacteria and is nonpathogenic. Therefore, the mass culture of Spirulina sp. can be performed effi ciently (Vonshak, 1997 ) . Because of these characteristics, many attempts to express foreign genes in Spirulina sp. have been made. One enzyme called human carbonic anhydrase, responsible for inter conversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate to maintain acid-base balance in blood and other tissues and removing extra carbon dioxide out of tissues and another called Mn superoxide dismutase from E. coli were cloned and expressed by Cao et al. in cyanobacteria. In this chapter an effort has been made to summarise ongoing global research on the most effi cient conditions for expression of the valuable genes of Spirulina sp. in other organisms and also research on how genes from other organisms can be cloned and expressed in Spirulina . The problems in engineering Spirulina and its probable solution have also been discussed.",

It helps the body absorb essential nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb common forms of food. Spirulina favours growth of benefi cial microorganisms like Lactobacillus and Bifi dobacteria in human digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function while reducing harmful microorganisms like E. coli , Candida and yeast. Benefi cial microorganisms increase absorption and assimilation of nutrients from the foods we eat, and helps to protect against infection. It also acts as a natural cleanser by removing mercury and other lethal toxins ingested by the body. Spirulina also increases stamina and immunity levels in athletes, and its high protein content helps to build muscle mass.

Some molecules which may harm human system and are absorbed by the body through pollution, poor diet, injury, or stress may also be eliminated with the help of these micronutrients. By removing free radicals, the nutrients help the immune system fi ght cancer and cellular degeneration. In some experimental fi ndings, Spirulina sp. was found effective in regression of oral cancer in laboratory animals, and may pave way in cancer treatment. Spirulina sp. also can reduce low density lipoproteins (LDL) which are associated with severe cardiovascular disorders like atherosclerosis and strokes. LDL sticks to inner wall of the arteries and get hardened thus blocking the normal blood fl ow.

In general, the bacterial chromosome containing circular DNA sometimes contains uneven distribution of G and C bases on both strands; this can be detected by G-C skewing which help to locate ORFs and termination of DNA replication. In case of Spirulina , any such apparent shift was detected by this analysis unlike other cyanobacteria. Spirulina genome comprises 6630 potential protein coding genes, 49 RNA genes which consist of two sets of rRNA genes, 40 tRNA genes which code for tRNA, tmRNA, \u03b2 subunit of RNAse P and signal-recognition particle RNA. Among the protein coding genes 3/4 th are of known function but no functional characterisation was done for about 1500 genes. Most of these genes are responsible for general cyanobacterian metabolism but the most strikingly the biosynthesis genes for cyanotoxins such as alkaloid toxins (anatoxins and saxitoxins), non-ribosomal peptide toxins (microcystins), urea-derived toxins (cylindrospremopsin) and ribosomal depsipeptide toxins (microviridins) were absent in the genome, which logically explains the use of 5 Pigment such as chlorophyll is found in great abundance in Spirulina along with phycocyanin and porphyrin.",

The reason is that natural one is easily assimilated and contains cis isomer, which is lacking in synthetic beta-carotenes. Kerfeld et al. ( 2003 ) and Wilson et al.

Interestingly they found a product of ketolase viz, 3-hydroxyechinenone, to bind to an orange carotenoid protein during energy dissipation from phycoliposome in photosystem II. Therefore, it is possible that an unknown type of ketolase may be present in the genome. All known cyanobacterial genes involved in biosysnthesis of fatty acids, vitamin E, lipoic acid, glycerolipids, lipo-polysaccharides and polyhydroxy alkanoates were detected by them.

            "text": "The biggest limitation in engineering any benefi cial gene into Spirulina is lack of complete understanding of the restriction modifi cation system of this cyanbacterium, high polysaccharide content of genomic DNA and excessive methylation. Genomic DNA of some blue green alga obtained through cesium chloride gradient purifi cation and ultracentrifugation is poorly digested while using common restriction enzymes. But digestion with these enzymes along the whole length of genome at specifi c restriction sites as in other microbes cannot be assured due to interference of excessive DNA methylation and polysachharide content. One alternative strategy was proposed successfully by Promega Inc. which involves no restriction digestion of the genomic DNA. DNA is fi rst extracted by incubating the cyanobacterial cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with 10 mg mL \u22121 lysozyme (Sigma) in 50 mM EDTA followed by addition of nuclei lysis solution. Briefl y the procedure for genomic DNA library preparation involves sonication of g-DNA, blunting of the overhangs with exonuclease digestion, adding adenine nucleotide adapter at 3\u2032ends using DNA-Taq polymerase enzyme and fi nally ligation into the pGEM \u00ae-T Vector System. This method is called \"T-vector method\" where genomic DNA from Spirulina platensis , a typical fi lamentous cyanobacterium that is well known for the resistance of its DNA to restriction enzyme digestion has been used.",

            "text": "One of the crucial criteria in identifying suitable vector construction is its stability of exogenous DNA expression in microalgal expression systems. With the rapid advances of genome sequencing technologies, gene sequences of various microalgae was published and large-scale approaches have been developed to utilize the sequence information into functional information. Generally, function of any gene can be derived using various approaches, such as analysis of gene expression pattern by promoter activity assay, gene silencing, ectopic expression, structurefunction analysis, protein sub-cellular localization examination, and in vitro or in vivo biochemical assays (Kumar and Hirochika, 2001 ; Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003 ) . The conventional method for engineering an expression vector construct depends on the restriction digestion of a suitable DNA fragment followed by ligation. This method is time consuming and is dependent on availability of appropriate restriction sites. This is a signifi cant technical barrier for large-scale functional gene analysis studies. Recently, the Gateway cloning system has been developed to facilitate large-scale production of gene constructs, and it is able to achieve rapid cloning of one or more genes into multiple destination vectors using site-specifi c recombination. The recombination cloning system is based on a two-step process (Earley et al., 2006 ) . Firstly, the desired DNA fragment is cloned into a general donor vector by \"GATEWAY\" -BP reaction. Then, the DNA fragment fl anked by two site-specifi c recombination sites (attB1 and attB2) in the donor plasmid can be transferred precisely into a variety of expression vectors by site-specifi c recombination reactions. Once the DNA product is targeted into a donor vector, the transfer of the DNA constructs into an expression destination vector which becomes simple and requires no traditional restriction enzyme/ligase cloning. This Gateway technology have been widely used in the research community, and many Gatewaycompatible open reading frame clone collections and expression plasmids have been created for functional genomic analysis in many organisms.",

In some cases, transformation resulted in the successful and stable expression of transgenes from either the nucleus or the plastid, but in most cases, only transient expression was observed. So far lot of research has been performed to increase the lipid yield of microalgae through optimization of growth and induction conditions, such as temperature, light intensity and duration, salt concentration, and nutrient requirement, while genetic modifi cations of microalgae to alter quantity, quality or composition of lipid are reported less. The main reason is probably the lack of a generally applicable transformation protocol for microalgae. Since microalgae are such a diverse group of organisms, it cannot be guaranteed that a method that works for one species could be applied to another one. Some antibiotics routinely used in the transformation of plants, such as kanamycin and zeocin, have been successfully used as markers in cyanobacterial gene manipulation . Also, heterologous gene expression in microalgae demands for preferential codon usage and appropriate promoter sequences to modulate each expression. This can be achieved by getting information on completely annotated and sequenced microalgal genomes. Any protocol for the genetic transformation of a microalgal strain needs to be customized to meet its specifi c requirements and overcome corresponding limitations.",

(2005) described an effi cient protocol for the extraction and purifi cation of extrachromosomal DNA (exDNA) from Spirulina platensis strains, such as Sp-HO1, Sp-D, Sp-S, Sp-T etc. This method was commonly described as CTAB-Proteinase K method. The homology of several exDNAs, as well as between exDNA and chromosomal DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting. Partial sequences of exDNA from Sp-S were cloned and the primary and secondary structures, open reading frames (ORFs) of the cloned fragments, and function of proteins encoded by ORFs were analyzed through bioinformatics analyses. Briefl y the CTAB method includes traditional method of cell lysis while adding Proteinase K during crude DNA extraction and purifi cation by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol. In this way proteinase K helps removing protein contaminants and improves DNA quality. This method was successfully used to extract extrachromosomal DNA from more than ten strains of Spirulina . The results suggested that different strains of Spirulina contains exDNA of different size, e.g. strain HO1 exDNA has a length of 0.75 kb whereas strain D, J and Z has that of approximately 1.1 kb. Sp-S has two exDNA: shorter one is 1.8 kb long and longer one is 3.6 kb long. Same is the case for Sp-T. Although the longer one is double the length of shorter exDNAs in above two strains 2D gel electrophoresis revealed no new bands and confi rmed that they were two independent strains. However, these DNAs were not abundant and difficult to isolate and purify from total DNA. The results revealed that three methods viz. freeze-thaw extraction, DNA gel extraction kit and alkaline method, can be used for exDNA purifi cation. However, the freeze-thaw extraction method is the best one. It is with recovery effi ciency over 90 %. Molecular characteristics of exDNA in Spirulina through studies on the genetic stability, probable molecular conformation and restriction enzyme patterns of the exDNA, it was found that these DNAs were stable.",

            "text": "Phycobiliprotein is an important light-harvesting pigment-protein available in cyanobacteria ( Cyanophyceae ), red algae ( Rhodophyceae ), the hidden of algae ( Cryptophyceae ) and a few dinofl agellates ( Pyrrophyceae ). According to the different composition and absorption spectra, the phycobiliproteins are generally divided into three categories: the phycocyanin (phycocyanin, referred to as the PC, the absorption spectrum in the 610-640 Nm), the phycoerythrin (phycoerythrin, referred to as PE, absorption spectra in the 500 to 570) and allophycocyanin (allophycocyanin, referred to as the APC, absorption spectra in the 650-671 Nm). These proteins can be used as industrial raw materials or food additives. Phycobiliprotein is widely used in the food industry, chemical industry, medical diagnosis, and clinical medicine. In addition, many kinds of phycobiliproteins, fl uorescent, high quantum yield, easy combination of a number of proteins with biotin antibodies, phycobiliprotein acts as a fl uorescent probe. Phycobiliprotein can be isolated and purifi ed from Spirulina. Spirulina farming diffi culties, its outdoor large-scale cultivation of the lack of systematic and comprehensive study, and high farming costs are expensive. So, phycobilisome protein from Spirulina sp. is not only the high cost but also complex process. The genetic engineering methods for the production of phycobiliprotein has played an important role. Qin Song (2008) showed that the Spirulina maxima phycocyanin gene is 1119 bp having 99 % homology with Spirulina platensis phycocyanin gene. The \u03b2 subunit gene sequences in the alpha subunit gene sequences upstream connection between 111 bp fragment of the gene, \u03b2 subunit and \u03b1-subunit gene contained 519 bp and 489 bp, encoding 172 and 162 amino acid residues. Possible ribosome binding sites in the upstream of the gene sequence of the \u03b2 subunit 8-11 bp exists at Gaga the binding site and a prokaryote ribosome binding sites usually ggaa similar, but not identical. Spirulina maxima phycocyanin three chromophore binding sites are the \u03b1 subunit amino acids-Cys 84 and \u03b2 subunits of amino acids-Cys82 and Cys153. The third chromophore binding site Cys153 located in the carboxy terminus of the \u03b2-subunit, has proved that this binding site is due to the subunit 12 amino acid residues (146-157). The phycocyanin contains many hydrophobic amino acid residues which play an extremely important role in phycocyanin gathering process. Tiboni et al. ( 1984 ) cloned the genes for two subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from fi lamentous cyanobacterium , S. platensis into E coli . Those genes were found located very close having a total length of 4.6 kb. The amount of large subunit produced in the bacterial host represents at least 10 % of the total extracted protein. Sergio et al. ( 1994 ) identifi ed a 23 kDA gene known to code for a serine esterase from the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis . It was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli before functional characterization. DNA sequencing studies revealed the primary structure of the esterase which had partial similarity with the carboxyl-esterase (esterase II) encoded by estB of Pseudomonas fl uorescens. Notably, the highest degree of homology was found in a stretch of 11 identical or highly conserved amino acid residues corresponding to the GXSXG consensus motif found in the catalytic site of many other esterases, lipases and serine proteases.",

Mutant strains for specifi c genes have been developed by mutagenesis also. Complete genomic sequences of some strains have been obtained and some genomic sequence projects are under way. Condition of effi cient electroporation into Spirulina was studied by Toyomizu et al. ( 2001 b) . The plasmid pHSG399 was transferred into Spirulina using electroporation technique and suggested the best electroporation condition is 5.0 ms pulse duration with an electric fi eld of 4-8 kV per cm.

Despite of having very high nutritional value, this alga may also cause some side effects to some individuals including allergic reactions like rashes, hives, and diffi culty in breathing. Some commercial Spirulina supplements may contain toxic substances as additives. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary to purchase Spirulina only from authentic sources. People with the serious metabolic condition phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot metabolize phenylalanine, and therefore, should not consume Spirulina . Similarly, this is not advisable for people with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The Spirulina may also antagonise the effectiveness of certain medicines, such as prednisone, which are commonly used for treating asthma and other infl ammatory diseases.

Some researchers have investigated the effects of Spirulina on stem cell growth and proliferation and revealed that this cyanobacteria has the potential to stimulate endogenous stem cells leading to healing and regeneration. Sequencing studies on Spirulina genome have helped to decipher functional role of many genes which can be exploited to produce useful neutraceuticals. The lack of suitable restriction modifi cation system and expression vectors limits gene transfer into Spirulina ; however several alternate strategies are coming up and construction of complete genomic library will help to understand structure function relationship at genomic level leading to engineering Spirulina for medicinal purposes. Recently, Verseux et al. ( 2015 ) indicated the potential of Spirulina in International Space Research stations . Spirulina can adapt itself in unfavourable environmental conditions like high salt concentration, adverse temperature and pH of medium where not much bacterial species can survive. So, pure cultures of Spirulina can be maintained easily. Cultivation of Spirulina will also help to enable environmental purifi cation during its photosynthetic process.
