Hospitals have been forced to reorganized their units in response to prepare for an unforeseen healthcare emergency. In this context, our laboratory (Molecular and Genomic Diagnostics Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS) re-modulated its priorities by temporarily interrupting most of the molecular tests guaranteeing only those considered \"urgent\" and not postponable. In particular, this paper details changes regarding the execution of germline BRCA (gBRCA ) testing in our laboratory. A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset. The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists. These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/ Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology. Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.",

In fact, approximately 3% to 10% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) have a family history of pancreatic cancer and approximately 10% to 20% of PAs are due to a genetic cause [7, 8] . Additionally, PC has some of the highest heritability of any cancer; Scandinavian studies estimate that up to 57% of the individual variation in risk is due to genetic factors [9, 10] . However, although the involvement of high-risk genes explains only a small proportion of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families, PVs in BRCA2 have been found in only 1.2% to 3.2% of patients with PC in most studies, whereas BRCA1 PVs are found in even smaller percentages [11] [12] [13] .

As a result, gBRCA testing has become routine in the clinical management of ovarian and breast cancer patients [14, 15] . Additionally, more recently, PARPi is playing an increasingly important role in the care of patients with PA and PC; nowadays gBRCA testing is recommended for all patients with pancreatic or metastatic PC as well as patients with high Gleason grade PC [16, 17] .",
