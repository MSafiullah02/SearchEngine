In 16-day studies, rats were fed diets containing 0, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 ppm of theophylline or given 0, 12.5 (twice daily), 25 (once daily), 50 (once daily), 50 (twice daily), 100 (once daily), 200 (once daily), 200 (twice daily), and 400 (once daily) mg theophylline/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage. In 14-week studies, rats were fed diets containing 0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 ppm theophylline or given 0, 37.5, 75, and 150 mg/kg body weight theophylline in corn oil by gavage. In 2-year gavage studies, rats were given 0, 7.5, 25, and 75 mg/kg body weight in corn oil. In 16-day gavage studies, treatment-related periarteritis occurred in arteries of the pancreas and adjacent to the mesenteric lymph nodes of early death male and female rats given 400 mg/kg once daily. In the 14-week studies, treatment-related periarteritis occurred at similar sites and in male rats exposed to 75 and 150 mg/kg, and in all exposed female rats (gavage studies), in females exposed to 1000 ppm, and in both sexes exposed to 2000 and 4000 ppm (feeding studies). In the 2-year study, chronic periarteritis was signi\u00aecantly increased only in the males receiving 75 mg/kg of theophylline. The adventitia, media and intima of medium-and large-sized mesenteric arteries were involved. Similar to other vasodilator chemicals, the pathogenesis of theophylline-induced vascular lesions may be a consequence of hemodynamic changes induced in the vascular wall.",

Theophylline is used as a pharmaceutical agent having the following eects: it stimulates the heart and central nervous system, relaxes bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, and causes diuresis. The main pharmaceutical uses are as a bronchodilator in obstructive airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma, and for myocardial stimulation. The therapeutic doses of theophylline range from 3 to 6 mg/kg, yielding a serum level of 10 to 20 lg/ ml (Kodama et al. 1980) . Theophylline is an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a; Semmler et al. 1993 ) and therefore has therapeutic use in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a disease in which TNF-a has been shown to play a pathogenic role (Semmler et al. 1993; Di Francia et al. 1994) .",

Theophylline is a methylxanthine structurally similar to purines and purine bases (Cornish and Christman 1957; Grygiel and Birkett 1980) and was selected for study as a representative of the purine structural subclass, particularly because of its relationship to purines, such as caeine, 1-methyl-3-hydroxyguanine, and 3-hydroxy-1-methylxanthine. The last-mentioned two compounds have been shown to induce sarcomas in rats when injected subcutaneously (Clayson and Garner 1976) . The nomination was also based upon its widespread use in humans as a pharmaceutical agent, possible genotoxicity in vitro, and the lack of information on the potential toxicity and/or carcinogenicity under conditions of chronic oral usage.",

The oral route of administration was selected because it is the primary route of human exposure to this pharmaceutical agent. Male and female F344 rats were given theophylline (>99% pure) in feed or by gavage in corn oil for 16 days or 14 weeks, or by gavage in corn oil for 2 years. Dosed feed was initially selected as the route of administration for the 16-day acute toxicity studies because theophylline is only moderately soluble in water. Additional 16-day studies were conducted using corn oil gavage as the route of administration in order to mimic human therapeutic use. Gavage studies also compared the toxicity of equivalent doses of theophylline given once versus twice daily; the latter split-dosing regimen more closely simulates human therapeutic exposure to theophylline (normally four times per day). Based on the results of the 16-day studies, 14-week studies were designed and conducted using two oral routes of administration, dosed feed and corn oil gavage given once daily. Two-year (chronic) toxicity/carcinogenicity studies were conducted using the gavage route of exposure.",

No single drug appeared to be associated with the development of vasculitis, and oftentimes, vasculitis developed when drug combinations were being taken. Ampicillin and penicillin, taken in combination with other drugs were implicated in 20% of the cases investigated. Clinical symptoms included skin rash, malaise, eosinophilia or unexplained fever in variable combinations. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, heart, liver, and kidney were the most commonly involved organs.",

In the present studies, the incidence of the lesions was dose related, which further supports a pharmacological/toxic mode of action rather than hypersensitivity. The particular predisposition of eects in the medium-sized arteries the splanchnic vasculature (mesenteric and pancreatic vascular beds) in the rat may be related to the anatomic location of these vessels with lack of supporting tissue, and possibly, to the localization of particular receptors to the drug in the vascular wall (Greaves 1990; Joseph et al. 1996; Kerns 1996; Kerns et al. 1989; Nordborg et al. 1985) .
