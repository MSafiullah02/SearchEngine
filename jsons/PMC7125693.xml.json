In man and mice it has been demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 also affect adaptive immunity, for example, by maturation of DC and promotion of a Th1-like immune response (Belardelli and Ferrantini, 2002, Biron, 2001). Production of IFN-\u03b1 can be induced by many viruses and bacteria, including components of these microorganisms such as glycoproteins, double stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) and DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-DNA). Such CpG-DNA is now recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can induce B-cell proliferation, NK cell activation and production of cytokines, including type I IFN (for review see Krieg, 2002, Yamamoto et al., 2002).",

            "text": "In the pig, only a limited number of studies on CpG-DNA have been conducted using either oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) that contain unmethylated CpG-dinucleotides (CpG-ODN) or plasmid DNA. It was found that the plasmid pcDNA3 induced IFN-\u03b1 in porcine PBMC (poPBMC) in vitro, when pre-incubated with lipofectin (Magnusson et al., 2001a), and also when administered in vivo into subcutaneous tissue chambers (Johansson et al., 2002). Methylation of the cytosine in the CpGs inhibited the IFN-\u03b1 inducing capacity of plasmid DNA in vitro (Magnusson et al., 2001a) and in vivo (Johansson et al., 2002). Other in vitro studies using ODN showed that the ability to induce IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in poPBMC was dependent on the presence of CpG (Kamstrup et al., 2001). However, both a CpG-ODN and the same ODN, but with the CpGs inverted to GpC, enhanced the ovalbumin-specific immune responses after intramuscular injection in pigs (Van der Stede et al., 2002). Therefore, the CpG may not be necessary for some immunostimulatory effects of ODN. In fact, the ability of certain ODNs to induce IFN-\u03b1 in human PBMC is retained or enhanced if the CpG is methylated or inverted to GpC (Magnusson et al., 2001b).",

The human PDC, also referred to as natural IFN producing cells (NIPC), appear at a low frequency but produce high levels of IFN-\u03b1 upon exposure to, for example, herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Cederblad and Alm, 1990, Siegal et al., 1999, Svensson et al., 1996) or CpG-ODN (Jarrossay et al., 2001, Krug et al., 2001a, Magnusson et al., 2001b). A corresponding cell type has been described in mice (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001) and in the pig, a small population of efficient IFN-\u03b1 producing cells (IPC) has been detected at stimulation of blood leukocytes by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Nowacki and Charley, 1993) or the herpes virus Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (ADV) (Artursson et al., 1992). After intradermal administration of ADV-infected cells, infrequent IPC were mainly localized to the regional lymph nodes (Artursson et al., 1995). The porcine blood IPC activated by TGEV were shown to resemble the human NIPC by their appearance as non-phagocytic, non-adherent non-B, non-T cells, of which some expressed CD4 and MHC class II molecules (Charley and Lavenant, 1990, Nowacki and Charley, 1993). Immunohistochemical analysis of TGEV-activated IPC in various lymphoid tissues revealed that these cells had a similar phenotype and that at least a subpopulation of splenic IPC expressed the myeloid marker SWC3 (Riffault et al., 1997, Riffault et al., 2001). Also, a small subpopulation of SWC3+ blood cells that express CD4 but not CD14 was shown to produce IFN-\u03b1 upon exposure to TGEV which further supports the existence of a porcine counterpart to the human/murine NIPC/PDC (Summerfield et al., 2003).",

Furthermore, the IFN-\u03b1 production was abolished after inversion of the CpGs to GpC in ODN A2. However, the IFN-\u03b1 inducing capacity was partly retained after inversion of the CpG to GpC in ODN H and ODN I which is in line with previous results using human PBMC (Magnusson et al., 2001b). It is in this context noteworthy that, after inversion of the CpGs to GpC, the ODN A2 retained its ability to enhance ovalbumin specific antibody production and cell proliferation when injected in pigs (Van der Stede et al., 2002), but not its protective effect at challenge with Listeria monocytogenes in mice (Klinman et al., 1999).

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the effect of lipofectin is protection of DNA/RNA from degradation by exonucleases (Thierry and Dritschilo, 1992) which also can be achieved by replacing phosphodiester nucleotides with nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate nucleotides (Agrawal et al., 1995, Pisetsky and Reich, 1999, Zhao et al., 1993). In the present study, CpG-ODNs with phosphorothioate nucleotides at their ends, i.e. ODNs 2216, D19 and MM1, were potent inducers of IFN-\u03b1 in poPBMC even without pre-incubation with lipofectin. However, the same ODNs synthesized with a complete phosphodiester backbone also induced IFN-\u03b1 without pre-incubation with lipofectin. One reason for this may be that these ODNs have flanking poly-G sequences that may form quaternary structures that enhance uptake, possibly by binding to scavenger receptors (Kimura et al., 1994, Lee et al., 2000, Pearson et al., 1993, Pisetsky, 1996). It was therefore tested if the addition of poly-G sequences could affect the IFN-\u03b1 inducing ability of ODN H. The addition of guanines at the 3\u2032 end of ODN H increased the IFN-\u03b1 induction and reduced the concentration of ODN needed but did not eliminate the need for lipofectin. Thus, the exact role of poly-G sequences or phosphorothioates in the activation of IFN-\u03b1 is still elusive. It is however notable that ODNs 2216, D19 and MM1, in contrast to ODN H with G-tails, all contain a 10-base long self-complementary nucleotide sequence that may form a \u201chair pin\u201d structure. Presence of such structures can increase the stability against nucleases and seems to be important for IFN-\u03b1 induction in human PDC (Cong et al., 2003), and could thus explain why ODNs 2216, D19 and MM1 induced IFN-\u03b1 production in poPBMC in the absence of lipofectin. However, poly-G sequences as such can also have direct immunostimulatory effects, for example, hexamers of guanines can induce IL-1, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 in human PBMC (Filion et al., 2003) and small modifications of a guanine can render the single nucleotide immunostimulatory (Lee et al., 2003). Interestingly, the induction of a protective Th1 type of immunity in a model of murine leishmaniasis, using phosphodiester CpG-ODNs, was dependent on poly-G sequences (Dalpke et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2000). The use of phosphodiester ODNs instead of phosphorothioate ODNs could be beneficial to avoid side effects such as long-lasting IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 production, that can be harmful or even break tolerance (Segal et al., 2000). The identification of phosphodiester ODNs that were potent inducers of IFN-\u03b1 production by poPBMC may therefore be valuable for future use as adjuvant components. Although a large variation was observed between individual pigs in the magnitude of IFN-\u03b1 production, the different IFN-\u03b1 inducers showed the same relative potency in each pig. Thus, it should be possible to predict the adjuvant activity of ODNs in pigs by comparing their IFN-\u03b1 inducing capacity in poPBMC cultures.",

In contrast, approximately 10-fold lower numbers of IPC were detected among ADV-induced poPBMC, which is in line with earlier studies using either TGEV (Nowacki and Charley, 1993) or ADV (Artursson et al., 1995) as inducer.

This precludes a clear assignment of porcine IPC as myeloid or lymphoid. The hematopoietic lineage origin of murine NIPC/PDC is also unclear (Bj\u00f6rck, 2002), whereas the human NIPC/PDC most likely are of lymphoid origin (Rissoan et al., 2002, Schotte et al., 2003). However, it has also been suggested that human NIPC/PDC can convert to myeloid-like cells (Comeau et al., 2002). The porcine IPC responding to CpG-DNA also expressed CD2, seemingly in contrast to results of early studies where depletion of CD2+ cells did not hamper the ability of poPBMC to produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to TGEV (Nowacki and Charley, 1993). The reason for this discrepancy is not known. The CD2 expression by porcine IPC is however in line with the expression of CD2 on human NIPC/PDC (Comeau et al., 2002). The CD2 molecule is expressed by many different cell types including porcine T- and NK-cells (Yang and Parkhouse, 1996), but also on porcine thymic dendritic cells (Salmon et al., 2000) and human monocytic precursors of dendritic cells (Di Pucchio et al., 2003). However, the porcine IPC activated by CpG-DNA are not likely monocytic DC because monocytes or monocyte-derived porcine DC did not produce IFN-\u03b1 upon treatment with CpG-DNA (Johansson et al., 2003), which is in line with the finding that human monocytes or monocyte-derived DC cannot produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to CpG-DNA (Kadowaki et al., 2001a, Krug et al., 2001b, Magnusson et al., 2001b).",

Double labelling for intracellular IFN-\u03b1 and various cell surface markers showed that the porcine IPC activated by immunostimulatory DNA exhibit many similarities to the human NIPC/PDC. It is thus likely that the porcine IPC that respond to the phosphorothioate CpG-ODN 2216 or lipofected plasmid DNA constitute the porcine counterpart to the NIPC/PDC earlier described in man and mice. Furthermore, phosphodiester CpG-ODNs were identified that efficiently induced IFN-\u03b1 production in poPBMC. More detailed analyses of the essential interferogenic DNA structures and the way they activate porcine NIPC/PDC may therefore result in more efficient vaccine adjuvants.",
