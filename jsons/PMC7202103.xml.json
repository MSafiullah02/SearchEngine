On the other hand, medical students are learners and are therefore not essential. Much of students\u2019 work must be repeated by licensed providers, creating a redundant patient care experience that increases possible exposures and transmissions, and wastes already limited personal protective equipment, including gowns and face masks. Even those of us in our final months of medical school realize our limitations\u2014we are not authorized to order medications or perform procedures independently. As even asymptomatic carriers can expose others to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), nonessential hospital personnel must be reduced to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and avoid straining our already burdened health care system.5",

            "text": "For students working in frontline settings, like the emergency department, there are also personal risks arising from exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For example, one of us (A.M.) was asked to see a patient for presumed syncope, only to realize 10 minutes into the interview that the patient had been experiencing 2 weeks of severe cough and chills; a COVID-19 test was ordered. Although A.M. was subsequently removed from that patient\u2019s care team per school policy, she was already potentially exposed. At one of K.K.\u2019s rotation sites, the first confirmed COVID-19 case originally presented with a chief concern of abdominal pain. Only after the patient was admitted and began coughing was the patient tested and found to be positive for COVID-19. Although exposures are often part of a provider\u2019s job, physicians, nurses, and other staff are hospital employees covered by policies like paid sick leave and comprehensive health insurance designed to protect them (and their families) in the event of severe illness. Conversely, unpaid students are not covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,6 and protections for medical students are not nationally standardized. Hospitals may cover students\u2019 immediate medical expenses incurred from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but this coverage does not extend to family members, spouses, and children who could be infected due to our exposure.",

But while these leaders beg the public to stay home and \u201cflatten the curve,\u201d institutional policies requiring medical student attendance in clinical settings seem to contradict this. Thus, we applaud the AAMC and LCME for concretely recommending that medical schools suspend student clinical duties temporarily to allow administrators time to restructure curricula, await the resurrection of adequate personal protective equipment supply chains, and anticipate results from preliminary studies of COVID-19. However, as it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic will resolve quickly,7 we ask our leaders in academic medicine to be thoughtful about timelines and strategies to safely reintegrate students into low-risk clinical settings, even if this means adjusting clinical schedules and requirements for graduation and residency applications.",

If this occurs, institutions should be judicious in balancing the need to alleviate workforce shortages with their ethical obligation to protect students and must offer students a minimum of payment and protections commensurate with the risk of filling these essential roles. Flexibility from our fellow students, administrators, and national leadership is critical in responding to this fluid situation.",

We again look to national leadership to offer reasonable alternatives and/or exemptions to reduce barriers that may prevent us from becoming licensed physicians at a time when we could be key in COVID-19 treatment and mitigation. Although some individual medical schools have graduated their final-year students early and given them the option to join the paid health care workforce,9 we hope that U.S. medical licensing and accreditation agencies will follow the lead of other countries, like Italy and Ireland10,11; offering expedited licensing processes for students matching into regions with the most severe outbreaks would provide those areas with an early influx of physicians.",

Though the suspension of clinical duties may be disappointing for students, continuing to rotate in high-risk medical settings at this point in a pandemic is not a worthy sacrifice. Serving as a physician in a pandemic, on the other hand, is worthy. In fact, caring for those in need is the calling that motivated many of us to go to medical school. We are not speaking out of self-preservation, but rather out of a commitment to public health and future service when we may have to step in for fellow physicians who require medical care or quarantine from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.12 We may even have to provide medical care for these colleagues ourselves.",
