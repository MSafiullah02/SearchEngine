The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and on February 11, the World Health Association defined the new coronavirus disease as COVID-19.1 Since then, the pandemic has spread to all continents except Antarctica. By mid-March 2020, there have been more than 200,000 cases reported worldwide. Whereas the time for reaching the first 100,000 cases took 12 weeks, only 12 days were needed to reach the next 100,000.1 In the United States, more than 10,000 cases and a total of 150 deaths from COVID-19 infection had been reported until March 21, 2020.2\n",

COVID-19 has a relatively low-resistance to disinfectants. As a result, a variety of regimens have been proven effective, ranging from 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, chlorine, and UV disinfection to a hot water bath at 56 \u00b0C(132.8 \u00b0F) for 30 minutes.4\n",

Symptoms have included burning, itching, and stinging. Such findings have been attributed to the use of PPE in 97.0% of 542 frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). The most commonly affected skin sites were the nasal bridge (83% due to the use of protective goggles but not the hygiene mask, cheeks, forehead, and hands.6 The prolonged contact with masks and goggles may cause a variety of cutaneous diseases ranging from contact and pressure urticaria or contact dermatitis to aggravation of pre-existing dermatides.4 A former study pointed out that more than 1/3 of health care workers complained of acne, facial itching, and even dermatitis from wearing a N95 mask.7\n",
