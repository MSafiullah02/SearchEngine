Fang Y et al reported a sensitivity of 98% for chest CT diagnosis of COVID-2019, while RT-PCR serves as the gold standard; its early sensitivity was only 71% [2]. The vast majority, 98%, show bilateral lung involvement. The typical chest CT findings of non-ICU patients are bilateral ground-glass opacity and sub-segmental consolidation, while the typical chest CT findings of ICU patients are bilateral multi-lobe and sub-segmental consolidation [3]. The affected lungs are mostly located in the peripheral zone. Other imaging features include linear opacities, \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d pattern, and the \u201creverse halo\u201d sign [4]. According to the COVID-2019 pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme of the People\u2019s Republic of China (trial version 5), imaging features can upgrade suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia to clinical diagnosis.",

This includes recurrent CT to determine the progression or absorption of lesions in the lung within a short period of time, especially for severe cases. Inflammatory absorption of the lungs on CT imaging is also one of the criteria for release from isolation and discharge in the guidelines from the first edition to the sixth edition. Actually, the number of CT scans ranges from 3 to 6 [5] within a short period of time. Even healthy people may get one CT or even two to ensure they do not have COVID-2019. Medical radiation exposure is therefore a concern, because the population is made of patients of all ages, including young individuals, infants, and puerperae, for whom the radiation dose is even a greater concern.",

We implemented a low-dose scanning protocol that reduced the patient\u2019s dose to 1/8 to 1/9 of the standard dose. In addition to all the abovementioned reduction dose strategy, we used energy spectrum tin-filtering technology (Sn100 low-dose protocol, Turbo Flash, SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers).",
