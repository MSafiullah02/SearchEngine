At the same time, concerns about privacy breaches in the context of big data usage are timely and relevant. The \"old\" debate over personal privacy and public security is not over. In a pandemic crisis, public safety is a top priority. This means that if a government pursues a legitimate use of certain information for the compelling public purpose, privacy rights may be at risk [1, 2, 3] . In particular, when personal information is crucial to control pandemic crisis such as COVID-19, \"implicit\" consent is more likely to be expected.",

For a face-to-face investigation, the main focus was to achieve specific research goals ensuring the personal privacy. However, in view of increasing social costs associated with prevention, treatment and compensation of serious infectious diseases, there was a growing demand for accurate information in pursuit of potentially disastrous public health risks. For an example, Gilbert Beebe suggested that gathering accurate information for public interest might be a higher priority over privacy issues [7] . The widespread flu epidemic in 2009 again provided additional support for this line of reasoning. In the course of using personal information for epidemiological investigations, individual's explicit consent was not always obtained. In the United States, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has established the privacy rules that set limits on the use and disclosure of any personal health information without the patient's approval [8] . At the same time, aggregating personal information for public health purpose was a somewhat different matter [9] .",

Researchers including Montjoye of Imperial College London, UK, conducted experiments with published data from the United States, Turkey, etc., and found certain attributes accurately even by using deidentified data [29] . Their machine learning model could identify individuals with 99.98% accuracy from any anonymized data using only 15 demographic attributes (age, gender, marital status, etc.). Montjoye suggests that there is a need to shift the paradigm of de-identification: \"We need to de-identify, then move on. Anonymity is not a property of the data set, it depends on how the person who writes it uses it.\" In other words, what matters is not anonymizing the data set but designing and organizing the data set that matters most.",

Personal information collected under the consent of the individual may be used for overcoming this pandemic and achieving related research purposes.

For the proper use of personal information in the fight against infectious diseases, consent to personal information is essential, and de-identified personal information must be used.
