The safety of blood donations may thus be affected by donors' risk of exposure to HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis and other TTIs via a number of different routes. These primarily include infection early in life, antenatal, perinatal, and other close contact, sexual contact, and percutaneous exposure through high-risk sexual behaviors, and unsafe blood transfusion and injection practices, cosmetic treatments and rituals. Current or previous country of residence, and travel history also need to be considered as there are a number of transmissible agents that are restricted geographically and therefore are not a threat in every donor/donation.",

In countries with developed health care systems, screening is largely automated using highly sensitive and specific assays performed within highly controlled systems.

However, many transfusion services follow a strategy that requires any screen reactive donation (initial reactive) to be retested (often in duplicate) using the same assay. If still reactive (repeat reactive) the donation is considered to be unsuitable for use and discarded, but if negative on repeat testing the donation is considered to be screen negative and released for clinical use.
