However, many patients treated with oseltamivir developed adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity, gastritis, and neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Mexican patients treated with oseltamivir and whether these ADRs are associated with SNPs of the genes involved in the metabolism, transport, and interactions of oseltamivir. This study recruited 310 Mexican patients with acute respiratory diseases and treated them with oseltamivir (75 mg/day for 5 days) because they were suspected to have influenza A/H1N1 virus infection. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviews. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probes. The association was assessed under genetic models with contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Out of 310 patients, only 38 (12.25%) presented ADRs to oseltamivir: hypersensitivity (1.9%), gastritis (10%), and depression and anxiety (0.9%). The polymorphism ABCB1-rs1045642 was associated with adverse drug reactions under the recessive model (P = 0.017); allele C was associated with no adverse drug reactions, while allele T was associated with adverse drug reactions. The polymorphisms SLC15A1-rs2297322, ABCB1-rs2032582, and CES1-rs2307243 were not consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and no other associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms. In conclusion, the polymorphism rs1045642 in the transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene is a potential predictive biomarker of ADRs in oseltamivir treatment.",

In the last century, there have been four significant worldwide outbreaks of influenza A with high mortality rates for humans [4] . To treat influenza, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of oseltamivir, which is a controversial [5, 6] antiviral agent that selectively inhibits the neuraminidases of both the influenza A and B viruses [7] . Viral neuraminidase promotes the release of progeny viruses from infected cells by cleaving the terminal sialic acid residues from carbohydrate moieties on the surfaces of host cells and influenza virus envelopes [8] . Oseltamivir was the best option for treatment and chemoprophylaxis during the influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic (influenza A/H1N1-pdm2009) outbreak because it could be administered to patients as young as 1-year old [9] . However, patients treated with oseltamivir have developed adverse reactions such as vertigo, dizziness, sickness, insomnia, headache, behavioural alterations, and numbness [10] . The U.S. FDA reported that oseltamivir's adverse effects on the central nervous system include delirium, hallucinations, confusion, abnormal behaviour, convulsions, and encephalitis [11] (http://www.fda.gov/ Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPa tientsandProviders/ucm107840.htm). Moreover, oseltamivir treatment has been associated with abnormal behaviour and death in patients from Japan and the United Kingdom [12] [13] [14] . However, the pharmaceutical industry has reported no adverse events [15] . In Mexico, oseltamivir phosphate was the only pro-drug that was distributed and prescribed for influenza treatment during the influenza A/H1N1-pdm2009 pandemic [16] , and no information is available for adverse reactions in the Mexican population.",

It was assumed that the incidence of ADRs in our study population was 13%. Considering a confidence level of 95%, a significance level of 5%, and a minimum power of 80%, a sample size of 245 subjects would be sufficient. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was estimated for all genetic polymorphisms by comparing their genotype frequencies. The associations were assessed using \u03c7 2 and exact Fisher tests in genetic models (codominant, dominant, overdominant, and recessive) and were validated by logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The P values were twotailed and adjusted by Bonferroni correction (Pc). Next, to exclude spurious association the Benjamini-Hochberg test was used for multiple test correction [32] . Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD, D\u2032) analysis between polymorphisms and haplotype reconstruction were performed. The associations between haplotypes and ADRs were determined by the Exact Fisher test. The HWE and haplotype reconstructions were performed using SNPstats software (https://www.snpstats.net/start.htm). The association analysis was conducted with SPSS software V.25 (IBM Corp., NY, USA). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Table 1 depicts the basic characteristics of the group of 310 patients who were suspected to have a pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 infection. Of the samples, 56% were from females, and 44% were from males. No significant differences were found between the ages of the female and male patients. The proportions of hospitalised female and male patients were similar (42% and 44%, respectively), and only five patients died (two females and three males). The patients' common clinical features (>70% of patients) were fever, cough, and the sudden onset of symptoms and headache. The majority of patients presented rhinorrhoea, prostration, shaking chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and odynophagia ( Table 2) . Of the total group, 130 (42%) tested positive for influenza A/H1N1, 11 (3.5%) were positive for seasonal influenza, and 169 (54.5%) were negative for influenza. The aetiological agent for patients with negative samples remained unknown. All patients were treated with Fig. 1 Transport, metabolism, and interactions of oseltamivir. The pro-drug oseltamivir phosphate is taken up by the peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) and is effluxed by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) before its activation by carboxylesterase 1 to oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate inhibits the release of progeny viruses from infected cells by blocking the viral neuraminidase but also inhibits the activity of human sialidase 2. The SNPs evaluated in this study are depicted in each protein. Pept1 peptide transporter 1 (encoded by SLC15A1 gene), P-gp P-glycoprotein 1 (encoded by ABCB1 gene), HA hemagglutinin, NA neuroaminidase. oseltamivir at 75 mg/kg/day for at least 5 days, and the signs and symptoms that were provoked by oseltamivir were recorded. Only 38 patients presented ADRs to oseltamivir (Table 3) , although some cases counted more than one adverse event in a given subject. Serious effects such as depression and anxiety were observed in three (0.9%) patients, but no seizures or hallucination effects were reported (Table 3) .

Table 4 depicts the genotypes. A \u03c7 2 analysis was performed to establish whether the identified variants explain the ADRs observed in the Mexican population. Only rs1045642 of ABCB1 gene (C3435T) was found to be significantly associated with ADRs (P = 0.031) under the codominant model (Table 4 ). Then, the polymorphism ABCB1-rs1045642 was subjected to logistic regression analysis for each ADR observed, and a trend of association was found between this SNP and gastritis (P = 0.057) under the codominant model, but it was significantly associated under the recessive model. Allele C is a protective factor (OR: 0.395, P = 0.017), and allele T had an increased risk of gastritis (OR: 2.532, Table 5 ).",

The prevention of those effects requires an understanding of how genetic polymorphisms affect oseltamivir's interaction with neuraminidases, metabolism, and transport. There was no record of its side effects in Mexico, despite its extensive use for influenza treatment. This study identified that only three patients (0.96%) presented side effects to oseltamivir treatment that were associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) such as anxiety and depression. In contrast, during the 2009 influenza pandemic period in the USA and Japan, onl\u1ef9 0.002% of patients presented NPAE [10] . That percentage is less than two orders of magnitude of the results of our study. P-glycoprotein and PepT1 are transporters that facilitate oseltamivir bioavailability. Both are expressed in the luminal membrane of the intestine and in brain capillaries [10, 17, 18, 33] . Oseltamivir phosphate but not oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for P-glycoprotein [17] . Genetic variants of the ABCB1 gene, which encodes human P-glycoprotein, have been identified, and some of those variants modify the transport rate of anticancer and anti-cholesterol drugs [22, 34] . The rs1045642 and rs2032582ABCB1 gene variants, which are the most extensively studied, have been associated with differences in expression and function [31, 32, 35, 36] . The frequency of the rs1045642 allele in the present population was not significantly different from its frequency in several European populations [35] . However, African populations have exhibited an elevated presence of the mutated allele (i.e. 73-83%) [36] .",

PepT1 also plays an important role in the transport of oseltamivir [18] . SLC15A1, the gene that encodes PepT1, presents several allelic forms. In particular, the rs2297322 polymorphism significantly reduces the transport capacity of PepT1 [45] . The objective of this study was to evaluate whether this polymorphism is associated with the adverse effects caused by treatment with oseltamivir. However, the data demonstrate that the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the SLC15A1 gene were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and analysis of this mutation was therefore omitted from this paper. In addition to bioavailability alterations, oseltamivir adverse effects have also been associated with deficiencies in its metabolism. CES1, the main enzyme responsible for oseltamivir metabolism [46] , presents genetic polymorphisms that change the conformation of the protein, which results in enzymes with slow or no activity. In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the allelic variant rs71647871 presents a decreased oseltamivir metabolism [19] . As Table 4 demonstrates, the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the CES1 rs71647871 polymorphism in our Mexican population were <1%, similar to the frequencies reported in Americans [47] . Other genetic studies have revealed mutation frequencies in CES1 of 3.7% in white populations, 4.3% in black populations, 2.0% in Hispanic populations, and 0% in Asian populations [47] . Shi et al. suggested that this mutation could explain~4% of the variability in the activation of oseltamivir [19] . While the rs2233385 NEU2 polymorphism has not been reported in European and African Americans, our results establish that the allelic frequency of this variant in the Mexican population was 7.4%, which is very similar to the frequency observed in Asian populations (9.2%) [29] . However, no association with oseltamivir side effects was found. Additional factors, such as oseltamivir's interactions with other drugs and alterations of inflammatory cytokines, could influence the activity of receptors and enzymes. These factors might contribute to an increase in the accumulation of oseltamivir, thus increasing the occurrence of adverse effects in humans. The limitations of this study were that it analysed a small number of samples and observed a low number of adverse effects. For these reasons, it is necessary to validate our results in a larger number of samples to suggest to the polymorphism in the transporter as a potential predictive biomarker of ADRs in oseltamivir treatment.",
