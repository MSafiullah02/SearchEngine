After completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, DNA microarray technologies developed very quickly and have since evolved into robust and reliable genomics-research tools. The systematic multivariate analysis of genome-wide expression data sets allows evaluation of correlations between gene expression patterns and the state and progression of disease, making possible patient-specific treatment based on a patient's individual genetic profile, an area that is known as \"pharmacogenomics\" or \"personalized medicine\" (Fig. 1 ) (1, 2 ) . Detailed information about a patient's genotype or gene expression profile can be used to stratify disease state, choose appropriate medication, adjust drug dosage according to a patient's requirements, or initiate preventive treatment. Personalized medicine has the ultimate goal of successfully implementing the 5 Rs: \"right patient/target, right diagnosis, right treatment, right drug/target, and right dose/time\" (3 ) . This goal can be achieved, however, only by combining genomic knowledge with traditional clinical approaches, the patient's personal medical and family history, and relevant clinical data, such as imaging and in vitro diagnostics results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "2 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1162, "text": "(3 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 721, "end": 728, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Gene expression analysis is still not routinely applied in personalized medicine, although gene expression profiling has generated numerous hypotheses relating to tumorigenesis and has provided both potentially prognostic and predictive signatures. Owing to posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation, proteins are more heterogeneous than the genes encoding them, and this heterogeneity often does not correlate with protein production. Posttranslational modifications extend the function of proteins in terms of recognition, signal transduction, and proteolysis. These processes regulate cell differentiation and/or proliferation. Proteins are also differentially produced in diseases. Many drugs used for treating disease are therefore directed against protein targets, such as protein kinases, cytokines, receptors, or their substrates, that have been shown to play a role in disease development (4 ) . Proteomics analyses therefore provide a more direct way of generating relevant data sets to improve our understanding of diseases at the level of the individual patient. The analysis of protein panels or even entire signaling networks can contribute to increasing the insights into disease development and progression on the molecular level, which in turn can enable the disease diagnosis at the individual level and the adjustment of therapies to the requirements of individual patients. Such detailed analyses require high-throughput multiplexed proteomics techniques capable of screening a multitude of parameters from minimal amounts of sample materials.

FPPM assays involve the immobilization of capture molecules (peptides, proteins, or antibodies) on a solid surface in rows and columns (microarray format) to capture the corresponding analytes present in complex samples (serum, plasma, or cell culture supernatant).

Planar microarray-based systems are perfectly suited to generate high-density protein microarrays that screen for a large number of analytes in a single experiment. Bead-based array systems provide an interesting alternative to planar microarrays, especially when the number of parameters to be analyzed is comparably low. Such bead-based assay systems are flexible, robust, and more advanced with respect to automation and enable scientists to screen thousands of samples within a short time (10, 11 ) . Many commercial FPPM products are now available, including assays for cytokines and chemokines, cancer biomarkers, and molecules involved in signaling pathways (Tables 1 and 2 ). The other assay format, the reversed-phase protein microarray (RPPM), consists of a multitude of different samples, such as tissue or cell lysates, that are immobilized as spots in rows on a solid support. Each microspot contains the entire proteome of a tissue or cell. Highly specific antibodies are used to simultaneously screen these spots for the presence or absence of distinct target proteins. This approach allows the identification of sets of proteins produced in large collections of tissue or cell samples (Figs. 2 and 3) (11, 12 ) . Typically, the molecules of interest, such as transcription factors or signaling molecules, are generally present only in low quantities. The low abundances of such molecules therefore require high-sensitivity de-tection methods, such as tyramide signal amplification or planar waveguide technology (13, 14 ) .

Fig. 3 summarizes the work flow of biomarker discovery with protein microarrays and the anticipated application of protein microarray-based assays for personalized medicine. Protein microarrays have recently demonstrated their huge potential in the field of biomarker discovery. RPPMs have been used to identify biomarker candidates in cancer patients that show changes in concentration that correlate with the state and progression of disease (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Sandwich immunoassays have proved to be an excellent method for accurately quantifying biomarker candidates. Multiplexing can easily be achieved with bead-based technologies. Highthroughput multiplexed immunoassays are perfectly suited for screening cancer biomarkers in a large cohort of clinical samples (21, 22 ) and provide insights into the details of the production of plasma or tissue proteins, thereby furnishing detailed information about a patient's physiological and pathologic condition. The use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools allows the identification of biomarker patterns that can then be used for diagnostic purposes. Data sets generated with multiplexed immunoassays can be integrated into multivariate diagnostic models with such algorithms as K-nearest neighbor and logistic regression. Such analyses can markedly improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnostics compared with what was previously possible with single-parameter analysis (23) (24) (25) (MIP-1\u2423), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, and tenascin C] and used it to distinguish plasma samples from patients with ovarian cancer from samples from patients with benign conditions. The screening of 176 patients and 187 controls revealed that the 11-plex achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as high as 90% (24, 25 ) . In contrast, a single parameter, CA-125, currently achieves a diagnostic sensitivity of \u03fd60% in early stages of the disease (23 ). These candidate biomarker panels require further validation with larger patient cohorts, however, before they can reliably be used in routine clinical diagnostics. The increasing list of biomarker candidates shows that protein microarrays have a huge potential to contribute to the development of individualized medical therapies. The knowledge generated with such protein microarrays not only will help clinicians adapt therapies to individual patient requirements but also will help minimize the risk of adverse effects caused by an incorrectly chosen drug or drug dose.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 465, "end": 469, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 470, "end": 474, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 803, "end": 807, "text": "(21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 808, "end": 812, "text": "22 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1493, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1498, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "(24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "25 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 21, "end": 27, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Protein Microarrays and Personalized Medicine"}, {"text": "Protein microarrays enable massively parallel quantification of biomarker candidates from large numbers of clinical samples in a very short time.

Combining the current antibody arrays with a direct sample-labeling strategy allows the analysis of only a limited number of parameters. Despite all the efforts made in recombinant antibody technology and classic antibody generation, high-quality antibodies directed against every single protein of interest are still not available (27, 28 ) . Nevertheless, high-throughput techniques for protein analysis have been used to generate whole-proteome arrays consisting of thousands of recombinant proteins (29 -32 ) . High-density protein microarrays are a data-driven approach that enables the identification of new autoantibodies that are specific for a variety of diseases (7, 33 ) . Hudson et al. used a protein microarray containing 5005 human proteins to identify autoantibody sets capable of recognizing 94 antigens in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer (30 ) . Four of these antigens were further confirmed with immunoblot and tissue microarray analyses. The researchers found that lamin A/C, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1), and Ral-binding protein 1 were produced in larger quantities in cancer tissue than in control tissues.

Nevertheless, the knowledge-driven approach is still the major strategy when screening for such analytes as acute-phase proteins, signaling molecules, and autoantibodies (36 -38 ) . Cytokines and chemokines, which regulate a variety of cell activities, including cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, and therefore play an important role in inflammatory diseases and different cancers (39 -41 ) , are the major proteins used in such studies (42, 43 (45 ) . Lysates prepared from large-core needle biopsies of invasive breast carcinomas were an-alyzed with bead-based immunoassays with the overall aim of evaluating the production of 54 preselected proteins. The results revealed that the profiles of 5 proteins in the tumor (fibroblast growth factor 2, Fas, Fas ligand, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, and RANTES) differed considerably between the patient groups with and without axillary lymph node metastasis.

Protein microarrays have proved to be an excellent approach for biomarker-validation studies. Over the last few years, different automation concepts have been developed for protein arrays. One of the most advanced formats is the bead-based systems, for which different companies have developed automated systems (62 ) . In addition, planar protein microarrays have been adapted to the 96-well microtiter plate format, which allows microarrays to be processed with standard pipetting robots or multichannel pipettes (22, 57, 63 ) . Several diagnostics companies have developed other protein technology platforms, such as the Randox Evidence biochip system and the IMPACT professional diagnostics platform (Roche Diagnostics) (64 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 343, "end": 347, "text": "(58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "59 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "(60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 525, "end": 529, "text": "61 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 799, "end": 804, "text": "(61 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1124, "text": "(62 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1326, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1330, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "63 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1536, "text": "(64 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein Microarrays for Biomarker Validation"}, {"text": "The major challenge in biomarker validation is the availability of high-quality capture molecules, e.g., antibodies (22 ) .
