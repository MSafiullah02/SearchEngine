Far from surgical procedures, young surgeons have changed their daily practice to respond to the emerging needs of the patients.

This finding is probably explained by the feeling of inability to provide competent medical care in a brand new subject never been learned in medical school that they finished many years ago [26, 27] . Hence, in France, a collaborative and helping crisis cell has been set up for every resident in need. Under the leadership of a national residents' union, this cell connects physicians in training with psychiatry residents 24 hours a day, in all regions of the country, in order to address their anxiety and to give them all the needed support.",

We used a non-validated questionnaire to assess stress and psychological impact of the crisis; other questionnaires like the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) which is a frequently used and well-standardized measure of recent emotional distress [6] , could have been used. Also, a pilot-test of the survey instrument among HCW was recommended to assess its validity. However, owing to time constraints, this was not done. Further assessments of this questionnaire in other populations could improve its reliability. The survey duration was voluntarily reduced knowing the current workload of physicians. Our study was timed after the announcement of an extension of the duration of the ongoing semester of this academic year which could be a confusion bias of stress. Indeed, in France, residency is divided into semesters within different departments (in May and November). Usually residents can experience an added level of stress approaching this department change, but a prolongation also can be confusing.",

The association includes all French junior and senior residents. All urologists in training, members of the association, were eligible to participate in the study. The survey sought to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID19 situation and was reachable via Google Form\u00a9. After the approval of the AFUF board, on the 27th of March 2020, the survey's link was e-mailed to the 495 members of the association. A reminder email was sent every day as it was decided that the survey would be closed 3 days later. Our 17-item survey included demographic questions: gender, age, level of training (PGY 1-5, junior urologist or researcher), and geographic region. Additional survey items were: past medical history, history of smoking or psychiatric medications and the responder's judgment if the institution is providing him the necessary protection equipment. The majority of the questions in this section were close-ended.",
