[3] [4] [5] [6] Myocardial injury, due to underlying ischemia, acute thrombotic occlusion, or myocarditis, is reported in 7-28% of hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients and is associated with higher mortality. [7] [8] [9] [10] Early reports indicate that in COVID-19 patients with ST-elevation on electrocardiography (ECG), emergent angiography has revealed a variety of findings including classic obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), non-obstructive CAD, angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries, and/or left ventricular dysfunction due to myocarditis or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. 11, 12 In an attempt to protect health care providers, some institutions and opinion leaders have advocated for thrombolytic therapy as initial mode of reperfusion. 13, 14 However, as the incidence of these STEMI mimics in COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients and their association with mortality is unknown, risks of fibrinolytic therapy may outweigh potential benefit. As this is a rapidly evolving pandemic with a paucity of data to drive clinical decisions and protect healthcare workers, The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Figure 1 ).

The rapidity with which this collaboration has occurred, both in the design of the protocol and data form, central IRB approval, and in site recruitment is attributable to both official and non-official social media resources (Figure 4 ). In the non-official social media platform, discussions within and eventually between a 93-member CAIC cardiologist WhatsApp group from Canada, and 49member SCAI Emerging Leader Mentorship current and former Fellow group representing most of the United States was instrumental in linking like-minded individuals resulting in refining the registry protocol as well as publishing ongoing guidance in approaching COVID-19 positive or PUI patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. 16, 17 The registry protocol was supported by executive leadership representing CAIC and SCAI who launched official webpages to announce the registry that was then widely reported. 18, 19 Concomitantly, a number of reports on Twitter (#CardioTwitter) of presumed STEMI COVID-19 positive patients whose subsequent angiograms showed non-obstructive CAD were tagged to individuals involved in the NACMI registry. These events led to a unified steering committee, strong multilateral society support from CAIC, SCAI, and ACC, engaged frontline interventional cardiologists, and over 100 enrolled sites, at the time of preparation of this manuscriptall of which occurred within the span of 14 days. The existing network will serve as a platform for rapid knowledge translation with a concerted effort to answer important questions in the midst of an epidemic.",

These implications are amplified by the current supply shortage of PPE. Furthermore, depending on the type of specimen collected, false negative rates of up to 30% has been reported in detecting COVID 19 26 . Therefore, the registry will include both COVID-19 positive patients and PUI with ST elevation. Comparison of PUI subsequently confirmed positive to those subsequently confirmed negative will provide a unique insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism of STEMI from COVID-19, including myocarditis and prothrombotic states. Comparison of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients enrolled in NACMI to propensity matched non-COVID STEMI controls for 1 year prior will provide critical information regarding etiology, treatment strategies and clinical outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic. As testing for COVID-19 becomes more rapid, this decision-making process is expected to evolve. Additionally, it has been reported that overall STEMI volumes have decreased in the COVID-19 era, without a clear understanding of the reasons. 27, 28 It may be that patients are delaying their presentation to the hospital, potentially leading to need for mechanical circulatory support in the acute setting, mechanical complications of STEMI, sudden death or an increased heart failure population. Additionally, if patients are presenting later in their clinical course, NACMI registry data will allow practitioners to improve care models to improve time to treatment in this unique era.",

This brings into question role of selection bias and whether our multi-center database reflects real-world experience. However, given that over 100 sites have responded with interest and they vary in geography, prevalence of COVID 19, and systems of health care delivery in United States and Canada, we believe we will get a meaningful look at the presentation and management of ST segment elevation in this patient population. We recognize that management of COVID 19 confirmed or suspected patients presenting with ST segment elevation is not static and will change over time due to many factors including availability of PPE, intensive care unit beds, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f community access to testing, better understanding of disease process, and different phases of enforcing and/or easing of social restrictions. We plan to better appreciate these temporal trends by subsequent analyses of crisis and containment phase. Finally, one may assume that a more accurate comparator to our proposed historical cohort would be a contemporaneous cohort of all patients presenting with STEMI during this pandemic (including those not suspected of having COVID 19). However, it was considered not feasible for many sites to capture all patients with STEMI. Furthermore, the current approach to patients presenting with STEMI is highly variable with some centers treating all patients presenting with STEMI as PUI irrespective of screening results while other centers have instituted no change to their STEMI protocols if patients screen negative for COVID 19.",

These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown.
