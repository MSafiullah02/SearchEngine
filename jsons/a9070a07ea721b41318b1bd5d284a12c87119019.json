            "text": "Dear Editor, Astroviruses (AstVs) (family Astroviridae) are positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses that infect a large diversity of mammalian and avian species. 1 In humans, eight serotypes have been described worldwide, accounting for 2%-9% of all acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis cases in children. 2 AstVs have been detected from over 80 non-human host species, including a large diversity of bat species in Asia, Europe and Africa, 3 and recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that the long-term evolution of AstVs is determined by frequent crossspecies transmission events. 4,5 During the past decade, numerous AstVs with potential zoonotic transmission have been described, highlighting the need for improved knowledge on their biology to prevent future health threats. 2 Bats are recognized as a major reservoir of infectious agents. Madagascar shelters over 46 bat species, of which nearly 80% are endemic, occupying different types of day roosts, including natural and synanthropic sites. Recent investigations have shown that the compositions of Malagasy bat species assemblages are correlated with factors associated with the diversity and transmission of infectious agents, such as paramyxoviruses and Leptospira. 6,7 The detection of new Betacoronaviruses in endemic Malagasy fruit bats also underlined the urgent need to better understand bat-associated infectious agents, and thus assess the potential for spillover to human populations in this major biodiversity hotspot. 8 Herein, Malagasy bats were sampled for the detection of AstVs in the context of a multilevel research program examining the systematics and biogeography of these animals and their associated infectious agents. Bats were trapped at two locations (Ambohitantely and Anjohibe) using mist nets, harp traps and butterfly nets. In Anjohibe, several different species were trapped in a large cave network, whereas in Ambohitantely, two species were sampled at different sites: Myotis goudoti in a cave roost and Mormopterus jugularis in a public school. Rectal and buccal swabs were obtained using sterile rayon-tipped applicators (Puritan, Guilford, ME, USA). Pooled swabs from each individual bat (one rectal+one buccal swab) were placed in the same tube containing 1.5 mL of brain heart infusion medium (Conda, Madrid, Spain) supplemented with penicillin G (1000 units/mL), streptomycin (1 mg/mL), kanamycin (0.5 mg/mL), gentamicin",

This detection rate was consistent with rates reported in other studies using the same PCR assay. 9,10 Six of the nine bat species tested positive (Supplementary Table S1), with significant variation between species (\u03c7 2 = 63.3, Po0.001). A difference in the mean detection rates between the Ambohitantely (1.96% \u00b1 3.81%) and the Anjohibe (30.7% \u00b1 8.02%) sites was also observed (\u03c7 2 = 23.2, Po0.001). This result may be affected by a sampling bias between the two sites (51 bats sampled in Ambohitantely versus 127 in Anjohibe) or may reflect species-and site-related variation in AstV infection. Repeated sampling of the same bat populations would be needed to examine potential seasonal variations in virus transmission between hosts and locations.",

For instance, the two viruses detected in Rousettus madagascariensis were more genetically related to AstVs found in Miniopterus griveaudi and in Triaenops menamena than to each other. The close proximity of bat roosting sites in the Anjohibe cave network may favor virus transmission between species and, more broadly, the infection of a large diversity of hosts sharing these habitats. The sequence detected in Myotis goudoti at Ambohitantely was closely related to one of the two sequences detected in the same species at Anjohibe, further suggesting that AstVs may easily spread within bat populations. Low levels of host restriction and limited phylogenetic clustering between viruses detected at distant locations have also been reported in other studies in Asia, Europe and Africa, 3 although the ecological drivers of AstV epidemiology and evolution remain to be determined. 4 This report suggests that Malagasy bats may act as reservoirs of a large diversity of AstVs. Further epidemiological work is necessary to identify hosts and ecological factors involved in AstV infection among bats. Additional sequencing may also provide important information on the origin and evolutionary history of these viruses. AstVs are important agents of acute gastroenteritis among children o24 months of age on Madagascar, where simultaneous circulation of multiple genotypes has been reported. 15 Comprehensive source-attributed case-control studies will be necessary to assess the risk of zoonotic transmission of bat-origin AstVs.",
