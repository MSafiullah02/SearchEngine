People no longer rely on television and print media alone for obtaining news, but increasingly make use of social media and news apps. The variety of information sources that we have today has contributed to the spread of alternative facts [1]. With over 1.8 billion active users per month in 2016 [2], Facebook accounted for 20% of total traffic to reliable websites and up to 50% of all the traffic to fake news sites [3]. Twitter comes second to Facebook, with over 400 million active users per month [2]. Posts on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter spread rapidly due to how they attempt to grab the readers\u2019 attention as quickly as possible, with little substantive information provided, and thus create a breeding ground for the dissemination of fake news [4].",

Social media continues to contribute to the increasing distribution of user-generated information; this includes hoaxes, false claims, fabricated news and conspiracy theories, with primary sources being social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter [6]. This means that any person who is in possession of a device, which can connect to the internet, is potentially a consumer or distributor of fake news. While social media platforms and search engines do not encourage people to believe the information being circulated, they are complicit in people\u2019s propensity to believe the information they come across on these platforms, without determining their validity [6]. The spread of fake news can cause a multitude of damages to the subject; varying from reputational damage of an individual, to having an effect on the perceived value of a company [7].",

This work was performed by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). The paper is presented as follows. The next section provides background information on fake news, its importance in the day-to-day lives of social media users and how information literacy and critical thinking can be used to identify fake news. Thereafter, the SLR research approach is discussed. Following this, the findings of the review are reported, first in terms of descriptive statistics and the in terms of a thematic analysis of the identified studies. The paper ends with the Conclusion and recommendations.",

            "text": "Although fake news has received increased attention recently, the term has been used by scholars for many years [4]. Fake news emerged from the tradition of yellow journalism of the 1890s, which can be described as a reliance on the familiar aspects of sensationalism\u2014crime news, scandal and gossip, divorces and sex, and stress upon the reporting of disasters, sports sensationalism as well as possibly satirical news [5]. The emergence of online news in the early 2000s raised concerns, among them being that people who share similar ideologies may form \u201cecho chambers\u201d where they can filter out alternative ideas [2]. This emergence came about as news media transformed from one that was dominated by newspapers printed by authentic and trusted journalists to one where online news from an untrusted source is believed by many [5]. The term later grew to describe \u201csatirical news shows\u201d, \u201cparody news shows\u201d or \u201cfake-news comedy shows\u201d where a television show, or segment on a television show was dedicated to political satire [4]. Some of these include popular television shows such as The Daily Show (now with Trevor Noah), Saturday Night Live\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend Update\u201d segment, and other similar shows such as Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert [4]. News stories in these shows were labelled \u201cfake\u201d not because of their content, but for parodying network news for the use of sarcasm, and using comedy as a tool to engage real public issues [4]. The term \u201cFake News\u201d further became prominent during the course of the 2016 US presidential elections, as members of the opposing parties would post incorrect news headlines in order to sway the decision of voters [6].",

There are many definitions for the phrase, however, a concise description of the term can be found in Paskin [4] who states that certain news articles originating from either social media or mainstream (online or offline) platforms, that are not factual, but are presented as such and are not satirical, are considered fake news. In some instances, editorials, reports, and expos\u00e9s may be knowingly disseminating information with intent to deceive for the purposes of monetary or political benefit [4].",

The immediate assumption is that in the digital age, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter should be able to curate information, or do some form of fact-checking when posts are uploaded onto their platforms [12], but that leans closely to infringing on freedom of speech. While different authors agree that there need to be measures in place for the minimisation of fake news being spread [12, 13], where that accountability lies differs between the authors. Metaxas and Mustafaraj [13] aimed to develop algorithms or plug-ins that can assist in trust and postulated that consumers should be able to identify misinformation, thus making an informed decision on whether to share that information or not. Lazer et al. [12] on the other hand, believe the onus should be on the platform owners to put restrictions on the kind of data distributed. Considering that the work by Metaxas and Mustafaraj [13] was done seven years ago, one can conclude that the use of fact-checking algorithms/plug-ins has not been successful in curbing the propulsion of fake news.",

Also, [8] and [2] mention how a story on the Pope supporting Trump in his presidential campaign, was widely shared (more than a million times) on Facebook in 2016. These articles also point out how in the information age, fact-checking has become relatively easy, but people are more likely to trust their intuition on news stories they consume, rather than checking the reliability of a story. The use of paid trolls and Russian bots to populate social media feeds with misinformation in an effort to swing the US presidential election in Donald Trump\u2019s favour, is highlighted [16]. The creation of fake news, with the use of alarmist headlines (\u201cclick bait\u201d), generates huge traffic into the original websites, which drives up advertising revenue [2]. This means content creators are compelled to create fake news, to drive ad revenue on their websites - even though they may not be believe in the fake news themselves [2].",

Teaching students the importance of information literacy skills is key, not only for identifying fake news but also for navigating life aspects that require managing and scrutinising information, as discussed by [1, 17], and [9]. Courtney [17] highlights how journalism students, above students from other disciplines, may need to have some form of information literacy incorporated into their syllabi to increase their awareness of fake news stories, creating a narrative of being objective and reliable news creators. Courtney assessed different universities that teach journalism and media-related studies, and established that students generally lack awareness on how useful library services are in offering services related to information literacy. Courtney [17] and Rose-Wiles [9] discuss how the use of library resources should be normalised to students. With millennials and generation Z having social media as their first point of contact, Rose-Wiles [9] urges universities, colleges and other academic research institutes to promote the use of more library resources than those from the internet, to encourage students to lean on reliable sources. Overall, this may prove difficult, therefore Rose-Wiles [9] proposes that by teaching information literacy skills and critical thinking, students can use these skills to apply in any situation or information source.",

            "text": "Only three of the articles had critical thinking as a main theme. Bronstein et al. [19] discuss how certain dogmatic and religious beliefs create a tendency in individuals to belief any information given, without them having a need to interrogate the information further and then deciding ion its veracity. The article further elaborates how these individuals are also more likely to engage in conspiracy theories, and tend to rationalise absurd events. Bronstein et al.\u2019s [19] study conclude that dogmatism and religious fundamentalism highly correlate with a belief in fake news. Their study [19] suggests the use of interventions that aim to increase open-minded thinking, and also increase analytical thinking as a way to help religious, curb belief in fake news. Howlett [20] describes critical thinking as evidence-based practice, which is taking the theories of the skills and concepts of critical thinking and converting those for use in everyday applications. Jackson [21] explains how the internet purposely prides itself in being a platform for \u201cunreviewed content\u201d, due to the idea that people may not see said content again, therefore it needs to be attention-grabbing for this moment, and not necessarily accurate. Jackson [21] expands that social media affected critical thinking in how it changed the view on published information, what is now seen as old forms of information media. This then presents a challenge to critical thinking in that a large portion of information found on the internet is not only unreliable, it may also be false. Jackson [21] posits that one of the biggest dangers to critical thinking may be that people have a sense of perceived power for being able to find the others they seek with a simple web search. People are no longer interested in evaluation the credibility of the information they receive and share, and thus leading to the propagation of fake news [21].",
