Recently, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have been demonstrated to be specialized in the production of high levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to a wide variety of viruses both in humans and mice (2\u20136). However, virtually any virus-infected cell can produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as recently exemplified for conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (7, 8). Indeed, the relative contribution of pDCs, cDCs or other cell types for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in vivo during viral infection is controversial (8\u201311). In order to activate pDCs at the right place when developing vaccination strategies aimed at harnessing the antiviral functions of these cells, it will also be important to assess the respective contribution of pDCs from various organs to overall IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in infected animals.",

A developmental, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of mouse pDCs has been described (13). One could therefore wonder whether the ability of murine pDCs to produce IL-12 could reflect the existence of a pDC subset specialized in the production of this cytokine that is absent in the human. Alternatively, each individual mouse pDC could be endowed with the ability to produce IL-12 and this may reflect an intrinsic difference in the signaling pathways triggered in human and murine pDCs by orthologous receptors.",

The second was to address whether pDC activation in response to a viral infection in vivo differs between different anatomical sites of viral replication. The third aim was to investigate whether production of multiple innate cytokines could occur simultaneously in vivo in pDCs at the single-cell level or whether these functions reflect the existence of distinct pDC subsets specialized in the production of different cytokines. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was chosen as a model because it is one of the best characterized systems to study innate and adaptive immune responses to infection in vivo (14). We have already reported a major contribution of pDCs for early IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IL-12 production in response to MCMV infection in vivo (10, 15) which has since been confirmed independently by others (16). However, other studies have documented the ability of cDCs to produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 upon infection with MCMV in vitro (8, 17). This observation, together with the lack of reagent which allow for the depletion of pDCs with sufficient specificity and efficiency in infected animals (18), led to the questioning of the relevance of pDCs in viral infection and to the proposal that cDCs or other infected cells significantly contribute to the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during MCMV infection in vivo (11).",

These studies are the first to demonstrate by direct ex vivo staining of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 that pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of these cytokines during MCMV infection of immunocompetent animals in three different mouse strains and with two different virus strains. Moreover, we show that pDC activation for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production is organ specific, with a major contribution of the spleen to the systemic production of the cytokines which contrasts with the lack of response observed in other major sites of viral replication. We also demonstrate for the first time that pDCs are the major source of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 early after viral infection, in contrast to the hypotheses proposing a predominant role of NK cells (14) or macrophages (19) for this function. A significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 in response to MCMV infection, although TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12. This suggests that the capacity of murine pDCs to produce both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IL-12 in response to MCMV exists within each cell and does not reflect the existence of different pDC subsets. Altogether, these results bring novel important insights on the local functions of pDCs in the host during viral infection.",

The three major splenic DC subsets, CD8\u03b1+ and CD8\u03b1\u2212 cDCs and pDCs, were sorted to >87% purity, with no or only very low-level cross-contamination between the subsets studied (data not shown). No signal for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was detected in samples from uninfected animals or in the absence of reverse transcription (data not shown), attesting to the lack of any DNA contamination in the RNA samples. At the highest concentration of cDNA used, Ifna/b mRNA could be detected in all DC subsets isolated from infected mice, with a stronger signal in pDCs (Fig. 1A). Serial dilutions of the cDNA clearly demonstrated that the amount of Ifna/b mRNA in pDCs was much higher than in the other subsets, with a signal still detectable at a 1:25 dilution in pDCs only. These results thus suggest that the three DC subsets examined express Ifna/b mRNA early after MCMV infection, but that this expression is much stronger in pDCs than in cDCs.",

No signal was detected in cells isolated from uninfected mice with any of the Ifna/b ProbSets (data not shown) and with many of the ProbSets directed against other innate cytokine genes, with the exception of Il1b, Il18, Ifng and Tnfa (Fig. 1C). In agreement with our RT\u2013PCR analysis, a strong signal was observed specifically in pDCs from infected animals for all the ProbeSets corresponding to Ifnb or Ifna genes. Expression of many of the genes encoding IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was also readily detectable in CD8\u03b1+ cDCs from infected animals, although with a 12- to 50-fold lower expression than in activated pDCs. No significant expression of Ifna/b could be detected in CD8\u03b1\u2212 cDCs (Fig. 1B), in B lymphocytes or in NK cells (data not shown). The expression of mRNA encoding LT-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p40 also appeared higher in pDCs from infected animals than in any of the other leukocyte populations examined, although expression of Tnfa and Il12b were also strong in cDCs. In contrast, the expression of Il1b, Il15 and Il18 mRNA was higher in cDCs than in pDCs. Finally, no significant expression of the mRNA encoding IFN-\u03b3 could be detected in pDCs while a strong and reproducible induction of this gene was observed in NK cells from infected animals. Altogether, these data show that, in response to MCMV infection, pDCs express much higher levels of all the Ifna/b genes examined and of Lta than cDCs, B lymphocytes and NK cells, while cDCs express higher levels of mRNA for IL-1\u03b2, IL-15 and IL-18 and NK cells higher levels of mRNA for IFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Since discrepancies have been repeatedly reported between the expression of mRNA and proteins, we next examined expression of certain cytokines by intracellular staining on freshly isolated splenic leukocytes of untreated versus MCMV-infected mice. Cytokine expression was assessed at 0, 24, 30, 36 and 44 h after MCMV infection of different strains of mice, based on previously reported kinetics measurement of serum cytokine levels (23). Serum peak production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-12p70 and TNF-\u03b1 was confirmed to occur between 30 and 36 h post-infection as measured by ELISA in C57BL/6 and 129S2 mice (Fig. 2A). Of note, the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response was faster, higher and sustained for longer in 129S2 as compared to C57BL/6 animals. The higher responses of the former animals are likely due to an enhanced intrinsic toll-like receptor reactivity of their pDCs (20) and to their stronger stimulation as a consequence of increased viral replication (NZ and MD unpublished data). To determine which cell types contribute to the production of the cytokines, intracellular flow cytometry was performed for detection of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 in total splenocytes isolated from untreated or MCMV-infected 129S2 mice (Fig. 2B). For all the three cytokines, the kinetics of detection of positive cells was consistent with that of serum levels (Fig. 2). A population positive for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was clearly detectable at 30 and 36 h. Nearly all these cells stained the strongest with the 120G8 antibody, a pattern specific to pDCs (18). Neither cDCs (CD11chigh; Fig. 2C and Table 1) nor granulocytes (GR1highCD11bhigh; Table 1), macrophages (GR1lowCD11b+; Table 1), B lymphocytes (CD19+), T cells (CD3+CD5+), NK cells (NKp46high) or IKDCs (NKp46+B220+) (data not shown) expressed detectable levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at the times of detection of maximal serum titers of the cytokines. Of note, most of the few cells expressing low to intermediate levels of 120G8 and marked with the anti-IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 antibodies were actually stained non-specifically since they also bound the isotype control antibody (Fig. 2D) and were present in similar number in uninfected mice. The induction of 120G8 on cells other than pDCs after MCMV infection is the reflect of a strong cellular activation, in part mediated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (18). Thus, some of the cells that express low to intermediate levels of 120G8 may have altered membrane properties as a consequence of their strong activation, which make them stickier to a number of molecules, including antibodies, independently of their expression of the targeted antigen or of Fc receptors. In any case, the 120G8high cells marked with the anti-IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 antibodies were stained specifically for the cytokines since they did not bind the isotype control antibody and were not present in uninfected animals. The 120G8high cells all expressed Siglec-H, a pDC-specific marker recently discovered (24, 25), in both uninfected and MCMV-infected mice, and the overwhelming majority of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2+ splenic leukocytes stained for Siglec-H, attesting to the fact that they are pDCs (Fig. 2E). At the peak of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production, about 18% of splenic pDCs produced detectable level of these cytokines (Table 2). Thus, these data clearly establish that pDCs are the only splenic leukocytes producing detectable levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during infection of 129S2 animals by the Smith strain of MCMV.",

Therefore, the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 by pDCs was measured by flow cytometry in the blood, the bone marrow (BM), the liver, the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and the lung of 36 h-MCMV-infected BALB/c (Fig. 5A) and C57BL/6 (Fig. 5B) mice. In BALB/c mice, a population of pDCs (120Ghigh cells) was clearly detectable in all the organs analyzed, although with major differences in the frequency of these cells among total leukocytes. While about 11% of pDCs stained strongly for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the spleen, no IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2+ pDCs could be detected in the blood, the liver, the MLN or the lung. In contrast, a small but reproducible fraction (\u223c1%) of BM pDCs stained strongly for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Similar results were obtained in 129S2 mice (data not shown). In C57BL/6 mice, only splenic pDCs were found to produce detectable levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data show a strong compartmentalization of pDC responses to MCMV infection in vivo and a major contribution of splenic pDCs to the systemic release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2.",

Therefore, immunohistofluorescence analyses for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression were performed on spleen sections from 36 h-MCMV-infected 129S2 (Fig. 6) and BALB/c (data not shown) mice. As previously reported (30, 31), infected spleens displayed dramatic changes in their structure due to local redistribution of cells and to infiltration of leukocytes from other tissues (Fig. 6A and B). Before infection, pDCs (120G8high) were observed in all the compartments of the spleen with a higher frequency in the red pulp while cDCs (CD11chigh) were found in the marginal zone of the spleen (Fig. 6C, top panels). No specific staining for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was observed in uninfected spleen sections (Fig. 6C, top row), as compared to isotype control signal (Fig. 6C, second row). After MCMV infection, pDCs became even more readily detectable as they migrated to the marginal zone (31) where they constituted clusters of cells strongly stained with 120G8 (Fig. 6C, two bottom rows). A strong, specific, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signal was detected in aggregated pDCs within some of the clusters of 120G8high cells (Fig. 6C, third row, see magnified inset). Additional, weaker, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 staining was observed in individual, 120G8\u2212/low cells, which was more difficult to discriminate from background but could suggest some minor contribution of other cell types to the production of the cytokines in the spleen. Thus, these data confirm that pDCs are the major producers of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the spleen early after MCMV infection.",

Mouse pDCs have been suggested to encompass different subsets of cells endowed with differential abilities for the secretion of pro-inflammatory versus IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 cytokines (13). Human pDCs are unable to produce significant amounts of IL-12 (2, 12), in contrast to mouse pDCs (10). In light of these observations, we next sought to determine whether the ability of the global pDC population to simultaneously produce multiple cytokines during MCMV infection resulted from the functional specialization of distinct pDC subsets or whether it reflected the ability of each pDC to mount multiple cytokine responses. To address this question, intracellular stainings were performed for simultaneous detection of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 in individual pDCs from 129S2 (Fig. 7), BALB/c and C57BL/6 (data not shown)-infected mice. All possible patterns of co-expression of the three cytokines analyzed were observed. A significant proportion of pDCs produced all the three cytokines simultaneously, about 25% of cytokine+ pDCs at 30 h (Fig. 7B) and 8% at 36 h (Fig. 7C). Remarkably, very few pDCs produced TNF-\u03b1 without producing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. A large proportion of pDCs produced only IL-12p40 at 36 h after infection, consistent with the delayed kinetics of appearance of this cytokine in the serum. The stronger co-expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and the delayed kinetics of IL-12p40 expression, in pDCs during MCMV infection suggests that each pDC is endowed with the ability to produce all the three cytokines analyzed but that differential molecular switches may regulate the expression of each of these cytokines as already suggested in previous studies (32, 33). This interpretation is also supported by the observations reported by others (34, 35) that nude CpG DNA activates cDCs specifically for IL-12p40 production but pDCs also for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, while liposome-encapsulated CpG DNA can induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in cDCs, due to re-routing of the oligonucleotides to different endosomes with a high retention time.",

This conclusion is supported by a set of different, complementary approaches, which allow the examination of cytokine production in a qualitative and quantitative manner ex vivo and in vivo in various cell subsets or in whole tissues. While previous studies have shown that cDCs can produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vitro upon infection with MCMV at high molecular infection ratio (8, 17), no other IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 producing cells than pDCs could be detected in infected animals by flow cytometry or immunohistofluorescence. We cannot completely exclude some participation of cDCs or other infected cells to the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in infected animals, which may not be detectable with our techniques. However, it should be noted that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by infected cells has been shown independent of MyD88 (8), while MyD88-deficient animals show a dramatic decrease in systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production (16, 32, 36). Even in 129S2 mice, which produce much higher levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 than C57BL/6 mice in response to MCMV infection, no significant contribution of cDCs to the production of these cytokines is observed at any of the time points tested (0, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h). Indeed, the percent of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2+ cDCs is always <0.1 in 129S2 mice, even at 30 and 36 h when over 10% of the pDCs are expressing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Moreover, since at 36 h post-infection in C57BL/6 mice, the percent of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2+ pDCs is 3.2 \u00b1 1.3%, the percentage of cDCs producing IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in 129S2 mice is much lower than the percentage of pDCs producing the cytokines in C57BL/6 animals. Thus, the potential contribution of cells other than pDCs to systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production during MCMV infection in vivo is very limited in all the three strains of mice examined. Our data also demonstrate for the first time that pDCs significantly contribute to TNF-\u03b1 production and confirm their involvement in IL-12 production, early after MCMV infection.",

However, whether compartmental differences exist in the ability of pDCs to produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vivo during viral infection has not been documented. Therefore, we compared pDC activation for cytokine production in various organs known to be major targets of MCMV replication, the lung, the liver and the BM, as well as in the blood and the MLN. Strikingly, our data show that an important fraction of pDCs producing high levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is detected only in the spleen, while a much weaker production can be seen in the BM of BALB/c or 129/S2 mice, and no cells positive for the cytokines were observed in the lung, liver, blood or MLN. Therefore, our data document a compartmentalization of pDC responses to MCMV infection and demonstrate that high local viral replication is not sufficient to trigger IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in these cells, with the major contribution of spleen pDCs to the systemic production of the cytokines contrasting strongly with the lack of detectable production in the lung or in the liver. The failure of lung pDCs to respond to MCMV infection could in part be explained by their reported lack of expression of TLR9 (21). In contrast, pDCs isolated from blood (37) or liver (29) have been shown able to respond to TLR9 triggering in vitro, such that the mechanisms for their lack of responses to MCMV infection in vivo are unknown and will require further investigations.",

            "text": "To analyze the ability of individual pDCs to produce multiple cytokines, we developed a protocol for simultaneous intracellular detection of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 by flow cytometry. A significant proportion of pDCs was shown to produce the three cytokines at the same time, although all patterns of co-expression of the cytokines were observed. Thus, no simple, discrete, subpopulations of pDCs specialized in the production of particular arrays of cytokines could be observed. Thus, the variations in individual pDC responses more likely occur as a result of quantitative changes in their differentiation status or activation kinetics as opposed to qualitative differences in their lineage origin. It should be noted that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 appeared more strongly co-expressed together than with IL-12, suggesting the existence of differential molecular mechanisms of control of the expression of these cytokines as compared to IL-12 as suggested in previous reports (32, 33). Indeed, it has been shown that the IRF-7/MyD88-dependent pathway necessary for pDC IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production is activated in early endosomes (34, 35), while pDC IL-12 production may occur downstream of the IRF5/TRAF-6/MyD88 pathway which is triggered in late endosomes (38). In this regard, it is interesting to notice that human pDCs, which produce both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 but not IL-12 (12) in response to TLR7/9 triggering, express much lower levels of IRF-5 that their murine counterparts or than cDCs (SHR and MD, unpublished data). Thus, MCMV DNA might activate TLR9 in mouse pDCs simultaneously in early endosomes for IRF7-dependent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production and in late endosome for IRF5-dependent IL-12 production.",
