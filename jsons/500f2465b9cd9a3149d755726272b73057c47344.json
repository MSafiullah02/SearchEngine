Johnston et al. reported that viral infections were associated with 80-85% of asthma exacerbations in children (Johnston et al., 1995) . Picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses) accounted for about 65% of these virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Also in adult asthma patients, respiratory virus infections are associated with the majority of exacerbations (Nicholson et al., 1993) . Corne et al. observed that HRV infections usually lead to more severe symptoms and longer duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease in asthmatics than in otherwise healthy individuals (Corne et al., 2002) . However, the exact mechanism by which HRV cause exacerbations of asthma is unclear. One postulated mechanism is that the HRV-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) receptor is up-regulated in asthma patients, therefore increasing their susceptibility to HRV infection (Manolitsas et al., 1994; Yamaya et al., 1999) . Another mechanism is suggested by the increased susceptibility to HRV infection of bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients (Wark et al., 2005) . The authors suggest that this indicates an abnormal innate immune response by these cells to infection by HRV, resulting in increased viral RNA expression and virus release from cells from asthmatics than from cells from healthy controls. The role of post-infectious immune responses was suggested by studies in patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma; those who had a high IFN-\u2425-IL-5 ratio (Th1 helper response) tended to have less severe symptoms after an HRV challenge, and shed less virus in the sputum, compared to those who had a low IFN-\u2425-IL-5 ratio (Th2-helper response) . The magnitude of the cytokine response (IL-8) in either the sputum or in the upper respiratory tract (nasal secretion), correlated with increased airway hyper-responsiveness Grunberg et al., 1997b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 69, "text": "Johnston et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 165, "end": 188, "text": "(Johnston et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 430, "end": 454, "text": "(Nicholson et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 649, "end": 669, "text": "(Corne et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 953, "end": 978, "text": "(Manolitsas et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 979, "end": 999, "text": "Yamaya et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1155, "text": "(Wark et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1938, "text": "Grunberg et al., 1997b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "These data suggest that differences in the immune response may be associated with differences in viral replication and severity of illness.

URT symptoms that were scored were defined as runny, stuffy or itchy nose, sneezing, watery/sore eyes, sore throat, hoarse voice and headache. LRT symptoms that were scored included coughing, wheezing, difficult breathing and shortness of breath during effort (Johnston et al., 1995) . Patients in the asthma group recorded peak flow each morning and afternoon (peak flow score), using their peak flow instrument (Mini Wright meter; Clement Clarke International London, UK) three times in succession, and recording the highest value. The median baseline score for a subject was the mean of the peak flow score in five consecutive time points around the baseline (week 8). Subjects were asked to contact the investigators if the URT symptoms score totaled 4 or more, and/or if the LRT symptoms score exceeded 5, resulting in a home visit within 48 h. Followup visits were performed at days 3-4, days 5-6, after 2 weeks and after 8 weeks (baseline). The duration of URT and LRT symptoms was determined by the number of days with a URT or LRT symptoms score of 1 above the individual baseline score, respectively. The severity of the URT and LRT symptoms was defined as the maximum of URT and LRT symptoms scores, respectively. During each visit a nasal wash (NW) was collected from each nostril as described previously (Grunberg et al., 1997b) . Briefly, 10 ml of sterile saline was instilled in each nostril and collected in the same tube. The tube was mixed thoroughly and immediately placed on wet ice.
