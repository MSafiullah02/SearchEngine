This variation results from various viral, host, and environmental factors. The identification of host genetic factors influencing inter-individual variation in susceptibility to several pathogenic viruses has tremendously increased our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways required for immunity. Next-generation sequencing of whole exomes represents a powerful tool in biomedical research. In this chapter, we briefly introduce whole-exome sequencing in the context of genetic approaches to identify host susceptibility genes to viral infections. We then describe general aspects of the workflow for whole-exome sequence analysis together with the tools and online resources that can be used to identify and annotate variant calls, and then prioritize them for their potential association to phenotypes of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A characteristic feature of human infections, including virus infections, is that just a proportion of exposed individuals develop clinical disease. Even during the 1918 influenza pandemic, the more recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic, only a proportion of individuals succumbed to infection [1, 2] . On the contrary, widespread pathogens that are innocuous for the most of the population, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), can be fatal only to a very few [3] . It is now well established that host genetic variation is an important component of the varied onset, severity, and outcome of infectious disease. Such data have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of virus infections shedding light into antiviral mechanisms required for host defense. Several different, yet complementary approaches to the identification of genetic variation important in infectious disease progression have been taken. By far the most common approach has been to look for association in candidate genes using case-control studies. These studies have highlighted a few common, high-penetrance (see Table 1 for the definition of the terms) human genetic variants associated with infection and disease resistance due to virus receptor polymorphism. A homozygous 32 base-pair deletion in the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5 \u039432) gene provides near complete protection against HIV-1 infection [4] , whereas homozygous individuals with nonsense mutations in the fucosyltransferase 2, or FUT2, gene are almost completely protected from experimental and natural infections with norovirus [5] . In a second approach, genome-wide linkage analyses paired with candidate-gene approaches have led to the identification of rare large-effect genetic variants in susceptibility to infection against pathogens segregating in families. An excellent example is the dissection of the genetic architecture of childhood herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a rare life-threatening complication of primary infection with HSV-1 [6] . A body of elegant studies have revealed that children with mutations in the TLR3-UNC93B-TRIF-TBK1-TRAF3-IRF3 pathway are particularly susceptible to HSE [7] , due to impaired CNS-intrinsic TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb immunity to HSV-1 [8] .

GWAS applied to other viral infections have confirmed a major role for HLA genes in host susceptibility against HIV, Dengue and hepatitis B viruses and identified several new risk loci [19] [20] [21] .

A recent report counted that out of about 300 primary immuno-deficiencies characterized at the single gene level, close to 1/3 have been identified by NGS in the past 5 years [27] . WES discoveries have provided fresh insights into the mechanisms that control the development, function, and regulation of immune cells during response to infection (recently reviewed in [26, 28] ). Notably, they have highlighted (1) pathways that are required for general protection against infection, generally involving genetic block in the T/B-lymphocyte differentiation program or result in absence of specific immune cells, and (2) pathways that are required for response to narrow groups of pathogens, somewhat reminiscent of infection-specific risk loci mapped by GWAS. An example of the latter was the discovery of compound heterozygous mutations in IRF7 in a child suffering from life-threatening influenza [29] . Each parent was heterozygous for a single mutated allele, indicating autosomal-recessive segregation for the IRF7-deficiency. Detailed biochemical analysis indicated that both alleles were loss-of-function mutations, consistent with the mode of inheritance. Mechanistically, IRF7-deficiency was linked to both, lack of IFN-\u03b1 production in the patient's plamocytoid cells challenged with influenza virus and lack of intrinsic anti-viral immunity in patientspecific fibroblasts or pulmonary epithelial cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).

Yet this portion houses 85% of the known disease causing variants [34, 35] . An individual exome typically harbors thousands of variants, compared to a reference genome, which are predicted to lead to nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, alterations of conserved splice site residues, or small insertions or deletions. As presented below, various methods exist to identify which variants deleteriously affect the function of individual proteins. However, each genome is thought to harbor about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants with about 20 genes completely inactivated [36, 37] .

The flagstat command from SAMtools [47] or DepthOfCoverage from GATK [48, 62] provides the calculation of the fraction of reads that successfully mapped to the reference, with number and percentages of the read mapped and unmapped.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 862, "end": 865, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Metrics"}, {"text": "Following these treatment steps of the read, variant analysis consists of three independent steps: variant calling, annotation, and prioritization.

Besides annotating functional effects of variants with respect to genes, ANNOVAR has many additional functionalities, such as integrating information from up to 4000 different databases and external resources to annotate the variants [67] . For SNPs, these include (1) calculating their predicted functional importance scores using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) [68] and PolyPhen2 (Polymorphisms Phenotyping v2) [69] and (2) reporting their conservation levels by PhyloP (Phylogenetic P-values) [70, 71] and GERP\u00fe\u00fe (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) [72] .

The more information gathered both on (1) the phenotype and (2) the gene in which the variant resides, the greater the likelihood to accurately assess the functional significance of a variant. Segregation of the variant with disease status is another key criterion for variant prioritization. This requires appropriate WES control data obtained with the same method from healthy subjects, ideally of the same ethnic origin as the patients. In case of complete penetrance, the candidate disease-causing variants found in patients cannot be present in unaffected subjects. In case of incomplete penetrance, the situation is more complex because these hypothetical disease-causing variants can also be present in asymptomatic subjects, including unaffected subjects of the same pedigree. 2. At the gene level, it is reasonable to first review variants found in genes that participate in its related pathways. This is also true when a phenotypically similar disease exists, and related pathways are known. The HGPS (Human Gene Connectome) ranks genes by their biological distance to core genes (known to be associated with phenotype), and provides the distances and all possible biological connections between all pairs of human genes based on protein-protein interaction prediction [74, 84] . Genes can be mapped online to KEGG (Kyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways [85] or REAC-TOME pathways [86] . It is useful to find information about candidate genes-knockout phenotypes. For this, the Mouse Genome Informatics database enables queries for human-mouse disease and MPO (Mammalian Phenotype Ontology) connections using gene symbols as an input [87] . Expression of candidate gene in the tissues or organs of interest is an important criterion for prioritization. GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) profiles [88] , the ExA (Expression Atlas [89] , and the BioGPS gene annotation portals [90] are excellent resources for this purpose. Knowledge about protein structure, function, and interactions also can help rank candidate genes. The Uni-protKB (Uniprot knowledgebase) collects information from several databases including curated protein sequences and structures with links to annotations of genomic variants [91] . The STRING database and associated search tools [92] are powerful resources for identifying interacting partners of a candidate gene's product or for identifying interactions between the products of a set of genes that bear functional variants.

A deep knowledge of the clinical and cellular phenotype, theprevalence of the trait in the general population together with an understanding of the familial segregation are essential in the prioritization of gene variants. For example, a recessively inherited disease variant is likely homozygous whereas a dominant disease variant is heterozygous. In general, a dominant allele should be absent in a variant database based on healthy controls or exceedingly rare to allow for reduced penetrance. However, there can be exceptions to these rules. For instance, recessive disease variants can be compound heterozygous. In a cohort, the search for either identical variants or additional rare variants in the same gene can further strengthen the evidence for causality. Variants found in a gene in which other variants have already been associated with a certain phenotype are more likely to be associated with the same phenotype, although this is not always the case.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
