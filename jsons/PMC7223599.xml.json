The long-term health benefits of reducing weight have been well studied [3]. Remission of diabetes mellitus (DM) is often cited as an indication for bariatric surgery, with multiple studies indicating promising use of bariatric surgery for this purpose [4, 5]. Nevertheless, there may be some concerns about the safety of bariatric surgery in diabetic patients since DM has been associated with increased perioperative complications including anastomotic leak as well as mortality [6, 7]. This does not seem to be a consistent finding as some studies have failed to demonstrate that increased risk [8, 9]. Furthermore, there is paucity of literature on the differences in perioperative outcomes in diabetics who require insulin therapy compared with those who do not. Our aim was to evaluate perioperative outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), the two most common bariatric procedures. We hypothesize that patients with DM will have a higher perioperative complication rate especially those requiring preoperative insulin therapy.",

The goal was to evaluate outcomes in IDDM. We hypothesized that these patients will have a higher complication rate as diabetic patients on insulin tend to have a longer duration of disease and, hence, higher rates of end organ damage. Our study found a higher 30-day perioperative morbidity in patients with diabetes compared with non-diabetics undergoing LSG or LRYGB. This was demonstrated independently in the NIDDM and IDDM groups. Patients with IDDM showed higher rates and higher adjusted odds for serious adverse events, readmission, length of stay, renal events, cardiac events, and surgical site infection for both LSG and LRYGB when compared with those of the NIDDM and NDM groups. As for mortality, IDDM and NIDDM patients had higher 30-day mortality when undergoing LSG but not LRYGB. This is, to our knowledge, the largest study comparing differences in perioperative complications between NIDDM and IDDM patients in bariatric surgery patients.",

However, their study did not show an increased risk of postoperative complications in NDDM patients [11]. Similar to our findings, Steele et al. demonstrated in their study on 22,288 bariatric cases an increased risk of cardiac, infectious, and renal complications in diabetic patients although patients were not stratified based on insulin requirement status [12].

For patients with obesity and DM, the comorbidities can be numerous and life-altering. The use of bariatric surgery for weight loss and reduction in obesity-related DM over a short period of time has been proven [14\u201316]. Several studies have shown data supporting the use of bariatric surgery for remission of DM [17, 18]. More recent studies clarified that bariatric surgery benefits specifically those patients with type 2 DM with more preoperative beta cell function [19], both when measured in terms of serum insulin levels and as preoperative insulin requirements [20]. However, the benefits appear to be mitigated in the obese with type 1 diabetes [21], who almost universally require daily insulin supplementation.",

It is unclear whether this was due to any physiological events perioperatively or simply due to worse disease manifesting as uncontrolled perioperative glucose levels. Leonetti et al. investigated the effects of specific preoperative diets in patients before bariatric surgery [23]. Although results were inconclusive, positive or negative results could help answer whether perioperative glucose control has more to do with the perioperative adverse outcomes or another physiological mechanism is at play in diabetic patients. Nonetheless, bariatric surgery should continue to be offered to those with DM, but with a heightened awareness of potential perioperative complications as indicated by our study. Preoperative optimization of diabetes status may be of benefit to these patients to prevent adverse outcomes.",

The MBSAQIP database does not record data on perioperative blood glucose control which limits our ability to adjust for diabetic control, number of diabetic medications, or amount of insulin used. It may be possible that poor perioperative glucose control contributed to worse outcomes in IDDM. However, if this was the mechanism by which the perioperative risks are increased it would be helpful to identify and evaluate in future studies since this is an opportunity to intervene and prevent complications associated with DM. Moreover, patients who were not offered surgery due to poor preoperative glucose control were not included in the analysis as they never received surgery. This creates a selection bias in the study and may underestimate the perioperative risk involved. Furthermore, the database only includes 30-day postoperative data. Therefore, no long-term conclusion regarding complications or remission of diabetes can be drawn.",
