Immunization with live smallpox pustules invariably triggered days of fever and nausea, at the end of which the patient was either immune or dead. Catherine the Great set an example for the citizens of Russia when she had herself inoculated in 1768 by the renowned expert in uariolafion, Dr. Thonias Dimsdale. \"My objective was, through my example, to save from death, the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, frightened of it, were left in danger.\"'2 As would many subsequent leaders, including President George W. Bush, Catherine the Great sought to inspire her people to endure the risk and pain of inmilation. Catherine's example not only persuaded her citizens to seek uuriolationclinics were established in Moscow, St. Petenburg, and in the provinces, including even Sikriabut through Voltaire's enthusiastic endorsement of her leadership, word about the benefits of uuriokation traveled throughout western Europe.\" At around the same time the earliest settlers in the New World learned of uariolution through different means. Cotton Mather's slave Onesiinus brought knowledge of this method of in~nunization from Africa. But Mather's attempts to promote it among the colonists failed for two principle reasons: 1) fears of contaniination from the vuriolu; 2) resistance to tampering with nature b y thwarting smallp~x.'~ The discomfort of the process also probably played a part; John Adams attributed his toothlessness in 'old age to the trauma of the smallpox inoculation he endured in 1764. 15 Today's immunization descends directly from the technique pioneered by Dr. Edward Jenner in 1796. 16 Observing that farmhands (usually milk maids) did not contract smallpox from exposure to a much milder form of ortho pox virus now known as cow pox, Dr. Jenner devised : I less toxic alternative to variolation. He infected his patients with pustules from cowpox, which protected against smallpox without the risks of using the real thing. He coined the term vaccine-from the Latin uuce, meaning cow. In 1881, Louis Pasteur took the term one step further, and coined \"vaccination\" to describe all immunizing injections.\"",

Elements of a potential solution are described below in the form of a National Biopreparedness Program, as a natural extension of the lessons learned from the identified shortcomings of the National Smallpox Vaccination Program. The proposed National Biopreparedness Program will require both the creation of a human infrastructure and an information infrastructure to ensure verifiable preparedness in every community throughout the country. Immediate creation of high priority and representative test sites (e.g., National Capital Region, combination of urban and rural counties in the East, suburban and urban counties in western regions, a Midwestern state) is needed to scope the necessary human infrastructure, validate the essential biodefense information infrastructure components, and to evaluate the synergistic impacts a robust biopreparedness program and infrastructure may have on participating communities, their citizens, and all levels of government. The components should be developed as self-replicating, interoperable toolset elements that enable rapid national distribution of standardized, yet locally customizable, community infrastructures.",
