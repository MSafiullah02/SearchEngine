Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication [2]. Regarding elective surgery, a study showed that at the hospital level, complications and mortality were not correlated, but FTR and mortality were correlated [3]. Therefore, the focus should not be on improvising operative techniques to prevent complications but on more efficient rescuing from the complications. Thus, FTR is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric [4] and is considered an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals [5]; this metric indicates the ability of a hospital to identify and successfully manage complications [6].",

Nevertheless, whether FTR in trauma care contributes to variations in mortality across centers [7] remains debatable, as there are some concerns regarding the use of FTR as a quality measure of trauma care [11]. First, severe trauma patients die in the hours immediately after injury, although all patients after elective surgery ideally survive. Outcomes after trauma complications may be less modifiable. FTR might play a relatively minor role in trauma patients compared with those after elective surgery. Moreover, with rapid progress in endovascular interventions and intensive care, surgeries for trauma have reduced. Conceivably, complications and FTR should be important in trauma patients regardless of FTR playing a minor or major role. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the association between a complication rate and FTR and a hospital performance level of trauma care in hospitals.",

These variables were chosen based on clinical relevance and a previous study [7]. Next, the predicted probability of death for each patient at each hospital was summed to obtain a predicted mortality rate for each hospital [Pc(E)]. In addition, we also calculated an observed in-hospital mortality rate [Pc(O)] at each hospital. To yield a standardized mortality rate at each hospital, the overall mortality rate was multiplied by observed to expected [Pc(O)/Pc(E)] mortality ratio. Finally, hospitals were divided into three by the quartile of standardized mortality rate.",

However, we assessed the timing of the complications based on the type and nature of complications. Some complications like internal diseases might have caused the trauma. Second, complications may have been under-reported leading to underestimation or misclassification. Considering the difference in the correlation coefficient in all hospitals and specifically those that contributed to the study, it is plausible for some hospitals to have misdiagnosed or misregistered complications to JTDB. This was corroborated by the authors of a previous study who reported on the inadequate registration of complications [7]. However, another study found no meaningful differences between a registry and a chart review [18]. Thus, fair and accurate reporting of complications is essential for estimating hospital performance. Third, the impact of small hospitals is not known because we excluded hospitals that contributed little to JTDB. Fourth, we did not extract data related to treatments after complications. Fifth, we did not have the data on the type of care provided in different hospitals. We could not specify the type of care administered (unit, team, hospital characteristics, etc.) and as such could not help addressing the much needed better understanding of what made one hospital really better than another. In addition, we could not show which factors lead to better outcomes. Therefore, it might be difficult to identify what we could change at their own institution to improve outcomes. However, we know the importance of prevention of and rescue from complications.",

Among trauma patients who survived for > 48 h, some patients suffered from complications, while others did not; the proportion of patients with complications is the \u201ccomplication rate,\u201d which is one of the outcome indicators. Those who suffered from complications were more likely to die than those who did not suffer from complications, i.e., the rate of \u201cfailure-to-rescue (FTR),\u201d which is another outcome indicator, is naturally more than the rate of \u201cnon-precedented deaths.\u201d Overall in-hospital mortality comprises these components. However, unlike reports of elective surgery, it has been controversial whether complication rate or FTR explains more variations in in-hospital mortality. In addition, FTR in trauma complication studies includes not only patients who have undergone surgery but also those who have not undergone surgery; this is inconsistent with studies on elective surgery. We investigated this research question in the present study",
