            "text": "Analyses of nucleotide sequences can provide a range of valuable insights into evolutionary relationships and timescales, allowing various biological questions to be addressed. The problem of inferring phylogenies and evolutionary divergence times is a statistical one, such that inferences are dependent on reliable models of the evolutionary process (Felsenstein 1983). Bayesian methods provide a powerful framework for estimating phylogenetic trees and evolutionary rates and timescales using parameter-rich models (Huelsenbeck et al. 2001; Yang and Rannala 2012). Model-based phylogenetic inference in a Bayesian framework has several desirable properties: It is possible to include detailed descriptions of molecular evolution (Dutheil et al. 2012; Heath et al. 2012); many of the model assumptions are explicit (Sullivan and Joyce 2005); large parameter spaces can be explored efficiently (Nylander et al. 2004; Drummond et al. 2006); and uncertainty is naturally incorporated in the estimates. As a consequence, the number and complexity of evolutionary models for Bayesian inference has grown rapidly, prompting considerable interest in methods of model selection (Xie et al. 2011; Baele et al. 2013).",

This can be problematic in phylogenetic inference when all the available models are poor descriptions of the process that generated the data (Gatesy 2007). Traditional methods of model selection do not allow the rejection, or falsification, of every model in the set of candidates being considered.

A different approach to model selection is to evaluate the adequacy, or plausibility (following Brown 2014a), of the model.

One method of evaluating the adequacy of a model is to use posterior predictive checks (Gelman et al. 2014). Among the first of such methods in phylogenetics was the use of posterior predictive simulations, proposed by Bollback (2002). The first step in this approach is to conduct a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the empirical data. The second step is to use simulation to generate data sets with the same size as the empirical data, using the values of model parameters sampled from the posterior distribution obtained in the first step. The data generated via these posterior predictive simulations are considered to represent hypothetical alternative or future data sets, but generated by the model used for inference.",

This comparison must be done using a test statistic that quantifies the discrepancies between the posterior predictive data and the empirical data (Gelman and Meng 1996).

            "text": "Molecular clocks have become an established tool in evolutionary biology, allowing the study of molecular evolutionary rates and divergence times between organisms (Kumar 2005; Ho 2014). Molecular clock models describe the pattern of evolutionary rates among lineages, relying on external temporal information (e.g., fossil data) to calibrate estimates of absolute rates and times. The primary differences among the various clock models include the number of distinct substitution rates across the tree and the degree to which rates are treated as a heritable trait (Thorne et al. 1998; Drummond et al. 2006; Drummond and Suchard 2010; for a review see Ho and Duch\u00eane 2014). For example, the strict clock assumes that the rate is the same for all branches, whereas some relaxed clock models allow each branch to have a different rate. We refer to models that assume a large number of rates as being more parameter rich than models with a small number of rates (Ho and Duch\u00eane 2014). Although molecular clock models are used routinely, the methods of assessing their efficacy are restricted to estimating and comparing their statistical fit. For example, a common means of model selection is to compare marginal likelihoods in a Bayesian framework (Baele et al. 2013). However, model selection can only evaluate the relative statistical fit of the models, such that it can lead to false confidence in the estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate.",

For each of these samples, we multiply the branch-specific rates and times to produce phylogenetic trees in which the branch lengths are measured in substitutions per site (subs/site), known as phylograms. To assess model adequacy, we randomly select 100 samples from the posterior, excluding the burn-in. From these samples, posterior predictive data sets are generated by simulation along the phylograms and using the estimates of the parameters in the nucleotide substitution model. The third step in our approach is to use a clock-free method to estimate a phylogram from each of the posterior predictive data sets and from the empirical data set.

To do this, we compared the values used to generate the data with those estimated using each of three clock models: Strict clock, random local clocks (Drummond and Suchard 2010), and the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (Drummond et al. 2006). We regarded the branch-specific rates as accurate when the rate used for the simulation was contained within the 95% credible interval. We found that rate estimates were frequently inaccurate under five circumstances: Clock model underparameterization; rate autocorrelation among branches (Kishino et al. 2001); uncorrelated beta-distributed rate variation among lineages; misleading node-age priors (i.e., node calibrations that differ considerably from the true node ages); and when data were generated under a strict clock but analyzed with an underparameterized substitution model (fig. 2a). When analyses were performed using the correct or an overparameterized clock model, more than 75% of branch rates were accurately estimated, such that the true value was contained within the 95% credible interval (fig. 2a). In most simulation schemes, the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock had high accuracy, at the expense of a small increase in the uncertainty compared with the other models (fig. 2b). These results are broadly similar to those of Drummond et al. (2006), who also found that underparameterization of the clock model resulted in low accuracy in rate estimates, whereas overparameterization had a negligible effect on accuracy.\n",

When the assumed model was underparameterized, A was \u22640.92. The uncertainty obtained using posterior predictive branch lengths was sensitive to the rate variance in the simulations. For this reason, estimates from data generated according to a strict clock or an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock had lower uncertainty than estimates from data generated under local clocks, regardless of the model used for analysis (fig. 3b). Estimates made using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock had a larger variance in three analysis schemes: When data were generated with autocorrelated rates across branches; when data were generated with beta-distributed rates across branches; and when there was a misleading prior for the node ages. For analyses with substitution model underparameterization, our method incorrectly provided greater support for the more complex clock model, indicating that rate variation among lineages was overestimated (fig. 3).\n",

However, we evaluated the posterior predictive P values for all branches in these empirical data sets and found that at least two-thirds of the incorrect estimates correspond to relatively short terminal branches (supplementary information, Supplementary Material online).",

Low values for this metric indicate small differences between the posterior predictive and the empirical branch lengths. Although scores for this metric varied considerably between data sets, they were closely associated with the A indices for the different models for each data set individually. For example, in every empirical data set, the lowest branch length deviation was achieved by the model with the highest A index (indicative of higher performance). Importantly, the branch length deviation was not directly comparable with the A index between data sets. This is probably because the posterior predictive branch lengths have different amounts of uncertainty. In particular, the A index will tend to be low if the posterior predictive branch length estimates are similar to the empirical value but have low uncertainty. This would create a scenario with a small branch length deviation but also a low A index. This appears to be the case for the coronaviruses, for which all the clock models appear inadequate according to the A index, but with the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock having a small branch length deviation.",

Although traditional model selection can be used to evaluate the relative statistical fit of a set of candidates, model adequacy provides information about the absolute performance of the model, such that even the best-fitting model can be a poor predictor of the data (Gelman et al. 2014). There have been important developments in model adequacy methods and test statistics in the context of substitution models (Ripplinger and Sullivan 2010; Brown 2014b; Lewis et al. 2014) and estimates of gene trees (Reid et al. 2014). Here we have described a method that can be used for assessment of molecular clock models, and which should be used in combination with approaches for evaluating the adequacy of substitution models. The results of our analyses suggest that our method is able detect whether estimates of branch-specific rates and times are consistent with the expected number of substitutions along each branch. For example, in the coronavirus data set analyzed here, the best-fitting clock model was a poor predictor of the data, as was the substitution model. Our index is sensitive to underparameterization of clock models and has the benefit of being computationally efficient. In addition, our metric of uncertainty in posterior predictive branch lengths is sensitive to some cases of misspecification of clock models and node-age priors, but not to substitution model misspecification, as shown for our analyses of the coronavirus data set.",

A possible explanation is that our simulations of the local clock represented an extreme scenario in which the rates of the local clocks differed by an order of magnitude. Previous studies based on simulations and empirical data demonstrated that this model can be effective when the rate differences are smaller (Drummond and Suchard 2010; Dornburg et al. 2012).",

This is consistent with the results of previous studies of posterior predictive simulations, which have suggested that the proposed threshold for a test statistic using simulations is conservative for empirical data (Bollback 2002; Ripplinger and Sullivan 2010; Brown 2014b). It is difficult to suggest a specific threshold for our index to determine whether a model is inadequate. However, the interpretation is straightforward: A low A index indicates that a large proportion of branch rates and times are inconsistent with the expected number of substitutions along the branches. Under ideal conditions, an A index of 0.95 or higher means that the clock model accurately describes the true pattern of rate variation. However, our method allows the user to inspect the particular branches with inconsistent estimates, which can be useful for identifying regions of the tree that cause the clock model to be inadequate. Measuring the effect size of differences in the branch length estimates of the posterior predictive and empirical data can also be useful for quantifying potential errors in the estimates of node times and branch-specific rates.",

This was demonstrated for molecular clock models by Wertheim et al. (2009). Although our results show a bias when the model is underparameterized, we did not detect high uncertainty with increasing model complexity. This probably occurs because the models used here are not severely overparameterized. This is consistent with the fact that Bayesian analyses are robust to mild overparameterization because estimates are integrated over the uncertainty in additional parameters (Huelsenbeck and Rannala 2004; Lemmon and Moriarty 2004).",

Although our simulations with misleading node calibrations were done using a strict clock, our method identified this scenario as clock model inadequacy when the models for estimation were the strict or random local clocks (fig. 3a). In the case of the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock, our method identified a misleading node-age prior as causing an increase in uncertainty (fig. 3b). This highlights the critical importance of selecting and using time calibrations appropriately, and we refer the reader to the comprehensive reviews of this topic (Benton and Donoghue 2007; Ho and Phillips 2009). Another component of the analysis that can have an impact on the adequacy of the clock model is the tree prior, which can influence the estimates of branch lengths.

Overconfidence in incorrect branch lengths in terms of substitutions can cause bias in divergence-time estimates (Cutler 2000). However, this form of model inadequacy is incorrectly identified by the methods we used for estimation as a form of rate variation among lineages. For our data generated using a strict clock and an underparameterized substitution model, the A index rejected the strict clock and supported the overparameterized uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock. On the other hand, the multinomial test statistic was sensitive to substitution model underparameterization, and to some forms of rate variation among lineages. The sensitivity of the multinomial likelihood to rate variation among lineages might explain why the substitution model was rejected for the coronavirus data set when using a clock model, but not when using a clock-free method. Due to this sensitivity and the substantial impact of substitution model misspecification, we recommend the use of a clock-free method to assess the substitution model before performing analyses using a clock model. Our results suggest that it is only advisable to perform a clock model analysis when an adequate substitution model is available. Other methods for substitution model assessment that are less conservative than the multinomial likelihood represent an interesting area for further research.",

In the analyses of the SIV data, our index of clock model adequacy was 0.78, similar to that of killer whales, for which the substitution model appeared adequate. We recommend caution when interpreting estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales when the substitution model is inadequate. This typically suggests that the substitution process is not being modeled correctly, which can affect inferences of branch lengths regardless of whether a clock model is used or not. For this reason, the A index of 0.78 for the SIV data set might be overconfident compared with the same index obtained for the killer whale data. Previous research has also suggested that there are processes in the evolution of SIV that are not accounted for by current evolutionary models (Wertheim and Worobey 2009).",

Examining the estimates of specific branch lengths can indicate whether many of the node-age estimates are reliable, or whether important branches provide unreliable estimates. We recommend this practice when the substitution model has been deemed adequate and when a substantial proportion of the branch lengths are consistent with the clock model (i.e., when the A index is high). We note that the mitochondrial genomes of killer whales have the lowest A index of any data set when analyzed using a random local clock. This might occur because the model identified an average of 0\u20133 rate changes along the tree (0.79 rate changes; table 1). Although rate variation is likely to be higher in this data set, it might not be sufficiently high for the model to detect it.",

The clock model with the highest performance had an A index of 0.70, which might be considered sufficient to interpret the divergence-time estimates for at least some portions of the tree. Again, the fact that the substitution model is inadequate precludes further interpretation of the estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales. This is a surprising result for a mitochondrial data set with several internal-node calibrations. A potential solution is to assess substitution-model adequacy for individual genes and to conduct the molecular clock analysis using only those genes for which an adequate substitution model is available.

In this study, we have presented a method of evaluating clock model adequacy, using a simple test statistic that can be computed efficiently. Assessment of clock model adequacy is an important complement to traditional methods of model selection for two primary reasons: It allows the researcher to reject all the available models if they are inadequate; and, as implemented in this study, it can be used to identify the branches with length estimates that are implausible under the assumed model. The results of our analyses of empirical data underscore the importance of evaluating the adequacy of the substitution and clock models. In some cases, several models might be adequate, particularly when they are overparameterized. In this respect, methods for traditional model selection are important tools because they can be used to select a single best-fitting model from a set of adequate models. Further research into methods, test statistics, and software for evaluating model adequacy is needed, both to improve the existing models and to identify data sets that will consistently provide unreliable estimates.",

One calibration was placed in one of the two nodes descending from the root selected at random, with an age prior of 0.1 times its true age (i.e., younger than the truth). The other calibration was placed on the most recent node in the other clade descending from the root, with an age of 0.9 of the root age (i.e., older than the truth). For this scenario, we only used trees with more than one descendant in each of the two oldest clades.

We calibrated the age of the root using a normal distribution with mean of 0.7 and a standard deviation of 5% of the mean, as used in the original study. The best-fitting substitution model for this data set was HKY+\u0393. Finally, we analyzed a data set of several genera of marine turtles, which comprised 24 sequences of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes (Duchene et al. 2012), and we selected the GTR+\u0393 substitution model. Following the scheme in the original study, we used calibrations at four internal nodes. The pure-birth process was used to generate the tree prior in the analyses of the killer whales and the marine turtles.",
