            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) named the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease Coronavirus and have stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with multiple possible transmission routes, including fecal-oral, and is characterized by a high infectivity [1, 2] . The outcomes of perinatal COVID-19 in infants are still under debate. Differently to some reassuring data about neonatal outcomes [3] , other reports have discussed adverse effects on newborns, such as fetal and respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function and even death [4] . Concern is rising on the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be vertically transmitted [5] , even if current evidence is inconclusive. IgM virus-specific antibodies have recently been detected in neonatal blood sera samples, obtained from one mother who tested positive for COVID-19 [6] . However, as SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in amniotic fluid, cord blood or breastmilk [7] at RT-PCR assays, this may exclude two possible vertical transmission pathways, i.e. intrauterine infection and breastfeeding. Vertical transmission can also occur during vaginal delivery, through neonatal contact with fluids of both the vagina and the rectum, as is already well known for pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus [8] and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) [9] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the vaginal fluid of women with severe COVID-19 has been excluded [10] . However, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the stools of one out of three non-pregnant positive COVID-19 patients [2] . The first potential vertical transmission, occurring during vaginal delivery in a COVID-19 positive pregnant woman with rectal and stool maternal positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2, has recently been reported [11] . This case suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the neonatal nasopharynx during vaginal delivery, potentially triggering neonatal infection. Current recommendations for pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 suggest that delivery mode should be determined primarily by obstetric indication and the mode of birth should not be influenced by the presence of COVID-19, unless the woman's respiratory condition demands urgent intervention for birth complications [12, 13] .",

However, the heavy workloads laboratories currently have to deal with for the diagnosis of COVID-19 worldwide makes the hypothesis of further scaling up for anorectal screening in all women programmed for vaginal birth and potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers, an unlikely proposition. Currently, there is no strong evidence in support of elective Caesarean section (CS) either in these patients if anorectal swab results are not available. We propose some preventive measures to be taken in an effort to reduce the potential risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during vaginal birth in women. This advice is not intended to replace that proposed by international associations, such as the WHO, RCOG and ACOG, and should rather be considered additional information provided in the light of the most recent evidence on the consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy and during vaginal birth.",

It has been estimated that IgG can be detected in positive patients' serum 14 days after symptom onset [17] and reported that SARS CoV-2 IgG can be passively transferred across the placenta from mother to fetus [18] . Among women who had a recent appearance of COVID 19 symptoms, there may not have been enough time for the development and the transplacental passage of IgG antibodies.
