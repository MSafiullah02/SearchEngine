            "text": "\nZoonoses are diseases transmissible from animal to man. The term was invented by Rudolf Virchow during his study of trichinellosis in 1855. In general, zoonoses are not transmissible by contact from the patient to other people, although there are notable exceptions with haemorrhagic fevers Lassa, Machupo, Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, or SARS, plague etc. The term used earlier for diseases transmissible from animals to man was \u201canthropo-zoonoses\u201d. By analogy, a term \u201czoo-anthroponoses\u201d was used for diseases transmissible the other way, from man to animals; however the number of the latter is limited (e.g., influenza, tuberculosis). Regrettably, many epidemiologists started to use these both terms in a reverse order (zooanthroponoses as diseases transmissible from animals to man), or promiscuously. The WHO therefore suggested using \u201czoonoses\u201d as the official term, and that the two previous terms should no longer be used. According to an expert commission of WHO/FAO the definition of zoonoses reads as follows: \u201cZoonoses are diseases and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man\u201d (WHO Tech Rep Ser 169, 1959). This definition was confirmed also by the third and fourth report of this Commission (WHO Tech Rep Ser 378, 1967; WHO Tech Rep Ser 682, 1982).",

However (and luckily), only a limited number of zoonoses can cause extensive outbreaks \u2013 e.g., salmonellosis, Q fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, chikungunya, RVF and American equine encephalomyelitides. Other zoonoses attract public (and media) attention due to their high lethality, sometimes associated with a high contagiosity for attending medical personnel (haemorrhagic fevers).",

The first group of zoonoses forms, e.g., vesicular stomatitis, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, glanders, listeriosis, erysipeloid or ringworm caused by Trichophyton verrucosum and Microsporum canis. These diseases are transmissible usually percutaneously, aerogenically, alimentarily or per conjunctiva, and often present typical occupational diseases in farmers, butchers and veterinary doctors. The second group form classic diseases with natural focality in the sense of J. N. Pavlovsky, e.g. tick-borne encephalitis and other arboviroses, tularaemia, plague or scrub typhus, where man acquires the infectious agent after entering a natural focus, commonly by the attack of an haematophagous vector. However, there does not exist a clear distinction between these two groups of zoonoses, and a number of zoonoses exhibit both urban and sylvatic patterns of circulation \u2013 yellow fever, American trypanosomiasis, plague.",

The most important feature is that the sapronotic agent replicates actively in these abiotic substrata \u2013 it is not the mere persistence of the microbe in the environment, nor secondary contamination of environmental objects with the agent from animal sources. The source of infection is therefore not an animal or man. Sapronotic agents are capable of reproduction both in abiotic environment (saprophytic phase) and in the organisms of homoiothermous vertebrates including man (parasitic phase). They show a \u201cdual life\u201d: saprophytic and parasitic (pathogenic). In particular, many human mycoses belong to sapronoses, especially visceral ones, like coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, emmonsiosis, cryptococcosis, and also some bacterial (legionellosis) and protozoan (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, naegleriosis) diseases, but no viral, rickettsial or chlamydial diseases (because obligate intracellular parasites are unable to reproduce extracelullarly).",
