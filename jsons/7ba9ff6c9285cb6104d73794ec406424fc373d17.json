Artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods can be useful to predict the parameters, risks, and effects of such an epidemic. Such predictions can be helpful to control and prevent the spread of such diseases. The main challenges of applying AI is the small volume of data and the uncertain nature. Here, we propose a shallow Long short-term memory (LSTM) based neural network to predict the risk category of a country. We have used a Bayesian optimization framework to optimized and automatically design country-specific networks. We have combined the trend data and weather data together for the prediction. The results show that the proposed pipeline outperforms against state-of-the-art methods for 170 countries data and can be a useful tool\u00c2\u0203for such risk categorization. The tool can be used to predict long-duration outbreak of such an epidemic such that we can take preventive steps earlier.",

            "text": "T HE novel corona-virus (COVID-19) is one of the most contagious diseases to have hit our blue planet in the past decades [1] . In little over four months since the virus was first spotted in mainland China, it has spread to more than 170 countries, infected more than 549,136 people, and taken more than 24,863 lives as on last week of march, 2020. As governments and health organizations scramble to contain the spread of corona-virus, they need all the help they can get, including from artificial intelligence (AI). Though current AI technologies are far from replicating human intelligence, they are proving to be very helpful in tracking the outbreak, diagnosing patients, disinfecting areas, and speeding up the process of finding a cure for COVID- 19 . It is noted that the country like Italy, Germany, Spain, etc. suffers due to underestimating the speed of the outbreak and unable to predict the effects on the country. Last few years, AI methods successfully applied in various predictive tasks such as stock value [2] , sales [3] , weather [4] , etc. and also predicting epidemic spread [5] . In this paper, we have proposed an AI-guided method to predict long-term country-specific risk. The primary challenges of such methods are: Small dataset: Majority of the machine learning (ML) algorithms demand a large volume of data for training. It is noted that the COVID-19 dataset is less than 90 days long and it is difficult to design accurate AI methods to train such small volume data. Uncertain data: The virus is very new to the researchers and majority of the parameters that can be used to predict the outbreak and risk factors are unknown. It is observed that the VOLUME 4, 2016 1 arXiv:2004.00959v1 [q-bio.PE] 31 Mar 2020 trend is also different in different countries. Hence, a generic AI tool may not be suitable for tracking all trends. It is also noted state-of-the-art deep neural networks fail because of the uncertainty in the data. This observation encourages us to design shallow and country data specific optimized neural networks.",

These are discussed below: (A) AI based epidemic researches: Real-time epidemicforecasting attracts several researchers due to the emerging applicability of the method. Jia et al. [6] proposed a neural network for predicting the outbreak of hand-footmouth diseases. Hamer et al. [7] use ML algorithms to predict spatio-temporal epidemic spareness of pathological diseases. AI tools for predicting outbreak in cardiovascular diseases [8] , [9] , Influenza [10] , and epidemic Diarrhea [11] is also proposed. A nice review of the AI application on such a prediction is reported in [12] . A collective learning based approach [13] is proposed to identify individual risk. In the last few years, machine learning analysis is used to predict epidemiological characteristics of the Ebola virus(EBOV) outbreak in West Africa [14] and such analysis is also used in [15] to assess the risk of Nipah virus. Plowright et al. [16] proposed a surveillance method to monitor Nipah virus in India. Recently, Seetah et al. [17] proposed a method for predicting future Rift Valley fever virus outbreaks. The majority of the algorithms use a combined decision-making application using statistical and machine learning methods to predict future growth based on past incident data. (B) Researches on COVID-19: The recent COVID-19 outbreak attracts many researchers to help and find a way to recover. Rao et al. [18] proposed methods to detect COVID-19 patients using a mobile phone. Yan et al. [19] built a predictive model to identify early detection of high-risk patients before they transmitted from mild to critically ill. In recent days, numerous research articles published on epidemic prediction of the corona-virus pandemic [20] - [29] . Researchers focused to designed new paradigm based on AI-driven tools [30] , [31] combining ML algorithms and different modality of data. An improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methodology is proposed in [32] . The algorithm is based on an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to estimate confirmed cases in the next ten days. Li et al. [33] developed a regression model to calculate the exponential growth of COVID-19 infection based on the total number of daily diagnoses cases outside China. Analysts obtained projections from 10 familiar machine learning and statistical ecological niche models in [34] against the examining of large-scale climatology variation.",

The method is also applicable in health to predict the health condition of a person on the last diagnosis data [40] . The method uses a feature attention mechanisms to predict future health risks. Other health areas such as antibiotic resistance outbreaks [41] and influenza outbreaks [42] , [43] are also used multivariate regression models. Different algorithms such as deep neural network [44] , [45] , \u00c2\u0203long short-term memory model (LSTM) [46] , and gated recurrent Unit(GRU)-based model [47] are successfully applied in various forecasting. The methods rely on specific less estimation error and running time on artificial network suitable data sets with characteristics of multivariate, sequential and time-series. Gap bridge by our method: The main challenge of predicting the long term risk of a country is solved by combining different weather data with the daily case data, choosing a feature selector, designing dynamic shallow recurrent neural network (RNN) which is optimized for an individual country, and combining fuzzy rule. It is noted in [31] that custom network for each sample can be a suitable solution for the data which inspired us to design an optimized network for each country. The problem of insufficient data is solved by choosing an optimized shallow network and the problem of predicting local trends is solved by optimizing the neural networks for individual countries. This introduces a new way to predict an epidemic outbreak and correlate with the risk of a country.",

We have used 10 days ahead to predict such risk classes. The accuracy is calculated in a state-of-the-VOLUME 4, 2016 art manner using a manual ground truth extracted from the trend data. Figure 10 shown the confusion matrix of the classification accuracy over 170 countries. It is observed that the method produce relatively lower accuracy of predicting MR class due to the incorrect trend rate prediction. We have achieved 78% average accuracy over all the country-specific dataset.",

We also propose to use the country-specific optimized network for accurate prediction and noted that this is suitable when we have a small and uncertain dataset. Combining the overall optimized LSTMs, we also note that rather deep neural networks, the majority of the cases a small neural network perform well in the data. The method can be useful to predict the longduration risk of an epidemic like COVID-19.",
