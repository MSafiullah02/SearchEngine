To date, the codon usage patterns in many organisms have been interpreted for diverse reasons. For instance, there have been some different influence factors proposed by researchers: the abundance of isoacceptor tRNA[1,2], amino acid composition[3], mRNA secondary structure[4], the efficiency of translation initiation[5], GC content[6], gene length[7,8], protein structure[9] and so on. Although there is still no final verdict on the formation mechanism, codon bias has been widely used to estimate and compare the expression level of endogenous genes, change the efficiency of expression of exogenous genes[10-12], identify horizontal transfer genes from other organism[13], judge the relationship of evolution[14], and confirm the coding sequences.",

Since then, extensive studies on codon usage bias have been performed in other organisms such as S. cerevisiae[1,15,16], Drosophila[17] and C. elegans[18]; and the results of this research have supported the dominant theory above. One long accepted principle of this theory is that highly expressed gene must show high codon usage bias. However, with the development of high throughput technology for gene sequencing and expression level detection, doubts over this theory have increased gradually[1,19-26].",

A survey of the literature indicated that in some prokaryotes, many indices exhibit a positive correlation with the gene expression level, such as CAI (Codon Adaptation Index)[27], CBI (Codon Bias Index)[28], and Fop (Frequency of optimal Codons)[1]. However, in some eukaryotes, especially for higher eukaryotes, the correlation between codon bias and expression level is extremely weak[1,29]. Therefore the balance between translational selection and mutational bias has been used to account for the codon bias observed in these organisms. These paradoxical results remind us there must be a more complicated mechanism for forming codon bias in different species beyond what this correlation suggests.",
