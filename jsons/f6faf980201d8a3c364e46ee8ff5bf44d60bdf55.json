A distinctive coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, has been determined to be accountable for the ongoing COVID-19 [1] . The SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 in human is proposed to be originated in bats and pangolins [2] . The first incidence of the transmission from animal to humans has been known to have occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late 2019 [3] [4] [5] . Since then, COVID-19 continues to emerge all over the world through the person-to-person transmission of viral droplets. The victims encountered by the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to develop a wide range of clinical symptoms that include dry cough, sore throat, fever, body pain, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fatigue [4, 5] . In the severe stage, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to cause pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, encephalopathy and multi-organ dysfunctions, thereby leading to death [4] [5] [6] . In general, coronaviruses have been known to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect the central nervous system (CNS) [7] . A growing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2.

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of positive-strand RNA viruses of the genus Betacoronavirus and it shares genetic similarity with two viral strains that appear to have originated in bats [2, 18] . The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recognized as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 [19] . Thus, cells that express ACE2 are vulnerable to the infection and are considered as the main target of the SARS-CoV-2 [20, 21] . The ACE2 gene is highly expressed in the respiratory tract and thus the lungs are the major hotspot of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its pathogenic events [22] . However, SARS-CoV2 infection appears to takes place also in the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, brain and other organs that are known to express the ACE2 [19, 20, 23] . Individuals with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders have been recognised to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection leading to the development of COVID-19 [1, 6, 24] . The abnormal expression and functions of the ACE2 have been linked to diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders [4, 20, 25] . Moreover, recent findings suggest that the density of the ACE2 on the cells increases upon ageing and its expression is found to be higher in men than women since SARS-CoV-2 appears to affect men than women in many countries [26] . While SARS-CoV-2 infection develops various symptoms in the host, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a pathological hallmark of COVID- 19 [27] . In many cases, pneumonia appears to be the major clinical consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to prominent proinflammatory process in the alveoli of the lungs [2, 26, 27 ]. Many reports from in vivo and in vitro studies and histopathological findings on the post-mortem human J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lungs suggest that SARS-CoVs causes apoptosis in alveolar cells and degeneration of small blood vessels of the lungs [1, 6, [26] [27] [28] . In the intensive conditions, respiratory arrest has been a major cause of COVID-19 associated death [2, 5, 26] . In addition, the available clinical data suggests that a significant portion of COVID-19 patients have hypertension and cardiovascular disease [6, 21, 24, 29] . The medications that are used to manage the symptoms of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders in association with diabetes have been known to induce the expression of ACE-2 [20, 22, 23] . Thus, it has been correlated that individuals with hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders are at high risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19 [24, 29] .",

Considering the fact, the SARS-CoV-2 infection might impair the brain function at the level of impaired synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and abnormal neurogenesis, gliosis leading to cognitive impairment and dementia similar to that of other neuro-invasive viruses including herpes simplex virus, poliovirus and HIV [40] .

Structurally, BoNTs consist of a heavy and a light polypeptide chains of about 100 and 50 kDa in size respectively, coupled by a disulfide bridge [11, 12] . The heavy chain of BoNTs binds to its receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cholinergic neurons and enters into the cytoplasm of the neurons as receptor-mediated endocytosis, where the disulphide bond between two polypeptide chains of the BoNTs disassociates and gains their activated form [11, 12] .",

BoNTs-mediated blockades of the ACh release and subsequent arrest in the cholinergic signalling at the synaptic junctions have been regarded to induce dreadful muscle paralysis and death [11, 12] . BoNTs are known to induce symptoms like dryness of the mouth and eyes, urinary retention, fluctuations of the blood pressure, abnormal heart rate, fatigue and dyspnoea [13, 14, 45, 12, 11] . The lungs are the primary target organ when BoNTs are inhaled as it induces acute pneumonitis and paralysis of breathing muscle leading to respiratory arrest [11] [12] [13] 45] .

Meanwhile, cardiac arrest resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 associated heart failure has also been linked to mortality in individuals with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID- 19 [24] . Besides, SARS-CoV-2 appears to enter the brain and elicit the neuropathogenicity in various brain regions that controls body temperature, reparation and heart beat [10] . Studies on the neuropathological studies derived from both patients and experimental animals have strongly indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can also induce neuropathological outcomes as like other neuro-invasive viruses [8, 10, 34, 42, 48] . Owing to the aforementioned fact, Li YC and co-workers have recently reported that patients with COVID-19 exhibit many neurologic signs and further indicated that the brainstem is highly vulnerable in subjects with COVID19 [10] . Moreover, the CT and MRI based findings revealed that the thalamus, medial temporal lobes and subinsular region are affected and development of encephalopathy is apparently evident in the brain of a subject with COVID-19 [49] . Considering the fact, it can be expected that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are at high risk of the onset of neurological, motor, cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, in addition to aiming the druggable strategies at peripheral and systemic levels, the brain represents one of the major therapeutic targets to manage the symptoms and to evade COVID-19 related mortalities. Though inhibition of the expression and functions of the ACE2 gene using inhibitors may be of help in prevention, it would not yield an ultimate cure for positive cases with COVID-19 [50] . Apart from the vaccination based prevention of COVID-19 in the unaffected population, a number of medical measures may be considered in order to manage and provide effectual defence against COVID-19, as follows 1) reduction of the viral load by pharmacological, genetic interference-based interventions or therapies to boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in positive cases, followed by 2) assigning antiinflammatory regimes to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 mediated chronic proinflammatory responses, 3) supplementation of cytoprotective agents and 4) implementation of neurotrophic support to sustain the neuroplasticity. While many drugs can individually J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f meet any one of the aforementioned strategies, identification of a single drug or establishment of a strategy with multipurpose therapeutic potentials might be highly appropriate for the moment.",

Moreover, therapeutic BoNT has been known to avert the irregular heart rhythm even after open heart surgery [55] . Therapeutic BoNT injection has been reported to improve blood circulation and oxygen supply thereby improving the survival rate of subjects with ischemic conditions [12, [56] [57] [58] .

While the prediction of the clinical outcome of the proposed drugs and therapies are the major focus, the underlying mode of action and possible adverse effects associated with such therapeutic approaches may not be excluded. For example, the hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a treatment regime for COVID-19 along with azithromycin [65] . However, there exist some considerable remarks that the antiviral mechanism of action of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2 or their probable effects to reduce the pathological events of COVID-19 remains unknown. Besides, the use of both drugs has been reported to be associated with some fatal side effects [66, 67] . While the transplantation of different types of stem cells has been proposed to improve the outcome of COVID-19 [68] , the use of stem cells has been known to be associated with the risk of developing tumor growth and metastasis [69] . However, there has been some mounting optimism generated on the implementation of the aforementioned drugs and cell-based therapeutics against COVID-",

Adding to that, therapeutic BoNT, regarded as a magic bullet appears to have a proven curative effect against many explicated symptoms of COVID-19 including the respiratory failure, cardiac defects and neurological deficits. Importantly, therapeutic BoNT has the capacity to migrate from intramuscular injection site to the brain and other organs [71] . Therapeutic BoNT is relatively safe and the beneficial effect of a single therapeutic dose of BoNT appears to be long lasting [79] . The therapeutic forms of BoNT are available under the brand names like BOTOX\u00ae or OnabotulinumtoxinA, Dysport, Bocouture and Jeuveau in all countries.",

Taken together, a mild dose of BoNT can be repurposed to combat the pathological stigma associated with multiple organ defects resulting from COVID-19. However, side effects that could arise from the use of BoNTmay not be completely ignored. Given that, stringent implementation of safety measures and the therapeutic regime of BoNT against the refractory disease like COVID-19 need J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to be envisioned. For the optimization of therapeutic dose and clinical procedure for the BoNT based therapy, administration paradigms, diagnostics measures and expected outcomes in different subjects with COVID-19 need to be outlined and designated in accordance with established experimental data, preclinical studies and human clinical trials under the regulation and guidelines of the global drug authorities, scientific bodies and health care associations. The human body and physiology have the tremendous ability for spontaneous recovery against many viral infections by a given time frame. Hence, a significant proportion of individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2 have recovered from the dreadful COVID-19 that would shed insight into the underlying mechanism of the disease and signify the possibilities for drug discovery. However, there is an urgent and unmet therapeutic need for the individuals with COVID-19 who are at a critical stage to diminish the mortality rate, for which identification and perspectives on the candidate drugs and approaches including the therapeutic BoNT have become highly important. Future experiments directed towards COVID-19 are needed however to validate the proposed therapeutic effect of drugs like BoNT.",
