The mean age of patients was 41 years-old. 30% of them had history of underlying diseases (hypertension or diabetes). We observed that mean SPO2% was 85.6% and 95.9% before and after positioning, respectively, and administrating this position show remarkable change in SPO2%. Also, the feeling of dyspnea decreased to 40% of cases and all patients were discharged from the hospital. Mean hospitalization duration for these patients was 4.8 days and no deaths occurred (Table 1) . Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.",

We suggest prone positioning. Some benefits have been stated for this position including: improved ventilationperfusion matching, recruitment of lung dependent regions, optimized chest wall mechanics, and enhanced drainage of tracheobronchial secretions.[3] Besides these declared benefits, there were not any consistent results about the effects of this position in ARDS cases. So Beitler et al. worked on a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials and finally reported that Prone positioning significantly reduces mortality from ARDS in patients with low tidal volume.[4]",
