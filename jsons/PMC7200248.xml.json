Research into videoconference pain treatment interventions is emerging but study numbers are low. Despite some promising studies, three systematic reviews evaluating the delivery of adult pain interventions via various eHealth modalities have been unable to unequivocally demonstrate the benefit of videoconferencing due to the low number of studies using this technology.9,14,15 Pediatric literature related to videoconferencing is increasing. A systematic review of technology-based family interventions for a variety of pediatric chronic illnesses identified 23 relevant studies of which the overwhelming majority (87%) featured a hybrid design. Although three studies investigated technology-based interventions for chronic pain or headache, none of these used videoconferencing. The mixed results and varying intervention targets for different chronic diseases made it hard for the authors to draw summative conclusions and they recommended further research evaluating both clinical and economic outcomes, and the identification of the \u201cactive ingredients\u201d of the interventions.11",

We developed a program that included a combination of group face-to-face sessions and individual videoconference into the home that we called Hybrid-PIPP. We reasoned that this would provide better outcomes than treatment delivered via individual face-to-face sessions (Standard Care) because the group therapy environment would provide positive peer modelling opportunities, reinforcement, and social support. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Hybrid-PIPP compared to Standard Care. The feasibility study was designed to a) test the integrity of the study protocol including the eligibility criteria; recruitment and consent process; data collection methods; randomization process; and acceptability of the intervention, and b) inform sample size calculation and selection of primary outcomes for the randomized controlled trial. Exploratory pre-and post-intervention outcome measures are reported; however, as this was a feasibility study there was no hypothesis established for statistical significance of treatment efficacy.",

The study protocol was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR 12614000489695) http://www.anzctr.org.au. A non-blinded matched pair randomized controlled model with parallel assignment was used. A matched pair design was chosen to reduce allocation bias by minimizing the differences between the treatment streams that may occur with a non-matched randomization, particularly with small sample sizes and heterogeneous participants.16 At the point of entry of each participant to the study, the streams represent the best possible balance related to functional disability.16 As this was a feasibility study, it was not powered to show statistical differences. Following consultation between the clinicians (two of whom had experience in delivering group interdisciplinary pain programs to adults totalling over 30 years), it was determined that three cycles of Hybrid-PIPP groups (with 4 to 8 families in each group) would be used to test the protocol. Because Hybrid-PIPP participants were matched to Standard Care, the intended participant numbers would therefore be between 24 and 48, dependent upon how many participants were randomized to the Hybrid-PIPP groups in each cycle.",

The intervention was informed by several sources5,19,20 and used an interdisciplinary cognitive behavioural pain management model, delivered within a neuroscience psycho-educational framework. The primary themes were the promotion of self-efficacy and increased engagement in functional activities despite pain; independence from medical and social care; and return to normal adolescent activity including school. The treatment model explored how pain can be amplified by thoughts and feelings; physiological responses (fight or flight); and maladaptive behavioural responses to pain. A contemporary pain neuroscience platform was used to describe the perpetuating factors of pain and provide the rationale for engaging in cognitive behavioural pain management strategies including \u201cbalanced thinking\u201d, goal setting, activity management, physical conditioning, communication skills training, sleep health, relaxation and mindfulness, and graded exposure to challenging activities. Participants were encouraged to: identify their own activity/pain patterns; set goals; identify core daily exercises based on treatment goals; plan and prioritize activities; and schedule their days (including avoiding long periods of rest or activity). Parents received the same information as the adolescents in addition to skills training to promote reinforcement of pain management strategies at home. Parents and adolescents were also asked to identify avoidant behaviours and develop a plan to address them using a graded hierarchy. These concepts were presented in age-appropriate terms, using metaphors and analogies to support learning. A file with handouts and worksheets was provided for both adolescents and parents. Families also had support from a school liaison teacher. Clinicians met at least weekly to discuss the participant\u2019s progress and provide interdisciplinary support to each other, with one clinician being allocated as a case manager for each participant.",

This required considerable administrative and clinician time to coordinate appointments between the 3 practitioners, made more complex by attempts to book sessions with all three clinicians in 1 day to reduce the travel burden on the participants. Despite this flexibility there was frequent poor attendance in this stream including both non-attendance of booked appointments, and poor uptake of offered sessions. Only 63% of the recommended sessions were attended by the families completing the Standard Care stream (that had flexible scheduling policy), compared to 94% in the Hybrid-PIPP stream (that had a rigid scheduling policy) see Table 5. Further inefficiencies in the Standard Care stream included the inability to leverage clinician time (such as by seeing more than one participant at once in a group), and time required to facilitate data collection.

In addition, the positive group effects seen in the workshop could not be developed further in the individual videoconference sessions. This significantly limited the potential benefits of peer problem solving and support for both the adolescents and their parents.
