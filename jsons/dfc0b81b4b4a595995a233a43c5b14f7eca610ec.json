Online testing offers a potential solution to this problem, even for fields like developmental psychology where in-person testing is paramount. Indeed, many child development laboratories are going online for the first time, a shift that is being facilitated by resources such as the Parent and Researcher Collaborative (https://childrenhelpingscience.com), a single, crowd-sourced platform where researchers from different labs can post their studies for families to participate in. And as more and more cognitive scientists are conducting their research online, we find ourselves wondering who is (and isn't) participating in this research.",

As excited as we are about the promises of online testing (e.g., in fields like developmental psychology where data collection is typically slow and expensive), we are also concerned about how the demographics of online participants may shift during COVID-19. In particular, we worry that online testing may reduce the diversity of participants--especially those from low-income and minority households-whose participation in scientific research has been essential in understanding all sorts of phenomena, from language proficiency [4] and spatial reasoning [5] to academic achievement [6] and brain development [7] .",

            "text": "At first glance, such a concern may seem unwarranted. After all, studies conducted online seem to be more diverse than studies conducted in laboratories [3, [8] [9] . In fact, with respect to household income, some estimates suggest a greater number of lower-income workers on MTurk than expected given the general population of workers [10] . Following this point, the monetary compensation associated with these studies could very well increase the diversity of participants, especially given that Turkers participate in numerous online experiments to supplement their income [10, 11] . So why are we worried about less diverse online samples during an economic downturn? J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Participation in online studies requires internet access, a staple among many, though not all, households. In the U.S., there is a well-known 'digital divide', in which Americans in rural and poor communities are less likely to have internet in their homes than urban and more affluent communities [12] . The Federal Communications Commission estimates that more than 21 million Americans do not have broadband connection with download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second, and nearly half of all households making less than $30,000 per year have no connection whatsoever. Moreover, Black and Hispanic Americans lag behind their White counterparts in internet adoption even when controlling for income. Nevertheless, in normal times, individuals without home internet access might be able to get online in public places such as schools, libraries, coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and even parking lots.",

Accordingly, it is possible that participants in online studies may now consist of those who can afford to weather the economic storm and/or have the time to participate in research studies given new demands on family care while working from home.

In this vein, we also encourage journals to require authors to report the characteristics of their study samples. For example, the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) enacted a sociocultural policy across all of its journals earlier this year, in January 2020. We recommend that other journals follow suit. Although the simple reporting of demographics J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f will not itself increase diversity within samples, it nevertheless ensures transparency and promotes future reproducibility.",
