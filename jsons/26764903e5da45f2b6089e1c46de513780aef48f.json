Moreover, training the staff is crucial to prevent exposure during any endoscopic procedure. 2 Although endoscopic procedures are rarely required for COVID-19-infected patients, it is prudent to consider all patients as potentially infected, especially in hospitals highly involved in the outbreak.",
