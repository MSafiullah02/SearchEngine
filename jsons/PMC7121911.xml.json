A virus causing a similar cytopathic effect in cultured cells was recovered from infants with respiratory illness shortly after, and studies of human antibodies in the serum of infants and children indicated that infection was common early in life [1, 2]. Now it is known that RSV is the most common viral agent of serious pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide. In most areas of the world, RSV is the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants less than 1 year of age. RSV causes severe disease in young infants, but disease is not restricted to the early life period. The virus can cause severe lower respiratory tract illness in large numbers of elderly subjects and also in subjects who are severely immunocompromised such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [3\u20137].",

Decreased levels of T cell memory in the elderly and specifically in patients with (COPD) may contribute to the increased susceptibility to RSV infection in these populations [21].

Serological methods are helpful in epidemiology and vaccine studies, but serologies are not often used for diagnosis in clinical settings. Because of the transfer of maternal RSV-specific antibodies across the placenta, and the high prevalence of early infection, it is unusual to find infants who are RSV seronegative. In older children and adults, a fourfold rise in serum antibodies is often used as evidence of RSV infection, but asymptomatic infections in which viral shedding is low in titer often are not accompanied by serum antibody rises. Serological tests in infants are even less sensitive, because young infants may not exhibit a large or durable rise in antibodies. Neutralizing antibody tests are considered the best functional marker of infection, but sensitivity is much higher in antigen binding assays using individually purified RSV F or G proteins [22].",

The virus is more thermolabile than most, and thus samples should be transported on wet ice to the diagnostic laboratory and processed rapidly. Prolonged times of transport to remote reference laboratories reduce the effectiveness of isolation. After inoculation onto susceptible cell culture substrates, highly trained staff can recognize cytopathology in the cell monolayers by visual inspection and conventional bright-field microscopy after about 3\u20137 days of incubation. Detection may be more efficient when using shell vial cultures and immunofluorescence [23].

Therefore, rapid diagnostic methods were developed for the detection of viral proteins or RNA in respiratory secretions. RSV antigen tests mostly rely on direct immunofluorescent assays (DFA) on exfoliated cells in secretions or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Nucleic acid detection assays based on RT-PCR are now widely available for RSV, often in a multiplexed panel for detection of multiple respiratory virus pathogens. These tests are typically more sensitive than any of the virus isolation or protein-based detection assays discussed above. Enhanced sensitivity is especially helpful when testing adults, who often shed virus in very low titers. Positive RT-PCR tests need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario, since the tests can remain positive for prolonged periods of time after infection, well beyond the period during which infectious virus can be isolated. Since children may experience symptomatic respiratory infections every few weeks during the winter, caution must be used in interpretation of positive PCR tests, especially when multiple viruses are detected simultaneously in a sample. Some instances of multiple PCR test positivity likely represent residual RNA from a previous virus infection and a second RNA type representing live virus from the active current infection.",

This in vitro effect is the origin of the virus name, although it is not clear that RSV causes syncytia in vivo.

The functions of these genes are not fully defined, but involve interactions with the host response machinery, especially interferons. The presence of these host response-modifying genes may explain in part why RSV appears to cause severe disease more commonly than MPV. Many of the gene sequences exhibit some clear global sequence relatedness; however, the extent of the relatedness of many of the sequences of corresponding proteins is relatively low. Based on sequence homology, it is not expected that there is a significant amount of immunologic cross-reactivity in responses to the two viruses.",

Since the virus is enveloped, chemicals that disrupt lipid bilayers (detergents) inactivate the virus, leading to the strong recommendations for healthcare provider hand washing following patient contact. The genome is a single strand of RNA, which forms a helical complex with the nucleoprotein (N). The final nucleocapsid structure likely is formed by the complete set of replication proteins, which also include the phosphoprotein (P) and the large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). It is suspected that the M protein helps the particle to form by bridging the nucleocapsid and the lipid envelope with its incorporated surface proteins. The surface of the particle incorporates three integral membrane surface glycoproteins, the highly glycosylated RSV G protein suspected to be the attachment protein, the fusion protein F, and the small hydrophobic protein (SH). RSV F (a Type I integral membrane protein) and RSV G (a Type II integral membrane protein) form oligomers on the surface of the particles, which appear like small spikes with globular heads when seen in electron microscopic (EM) images by negative stain. The morphology of particles in EM images or in fluorescent microscopy images labeled by conjugated antibodies suggests that the virion particles are filamentous. However, spherical particles, filaments, and more pleomorphic forms have been observed; therefore, it is uncertain what the morphology of infectious particles in vivo during natural infection is.",

This membrane insertion event accomplishes a fusion of the viral and host membranes, allowing delivery of the nucleocapsid to the cytoplasm where viral replication occurs. This event is termed \u201cfusion from without\u201d when the particle enters a cell.

Some adult infections are asymptomatic, and most are limited symptoms related to infection of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold [28, 36, 38]. Since otherwise healthy adults all possess measurable RSV serum antibodies and RSV-specific T cells, it is clear that prior exposure and induction of immune responses may not prevent infection. However, disease severity is usually reduced after one or several infections early in life, thus immune effectors such as serum neutralizing antibodies do prevent severe disease during reinfections. Unlike influenza virus, RSV does not exhibit a progressive antigenic drift. Although RSV antigenic diversity is observed in field strains, diversity of the antigenic proteins is not required for RSV to cause reinfection [39\u201341]. Most experts believe that serum neutralizing antibodies protect against severe lower respiratory tract disease but do not result in sterilizing immunity against infection at the respiratory mucosa. Thus, healthy adults show signs and symptoms of the common cold in about half of cases of natural or experimental infections, even though they have experienced numerous previous RSV infections [39].",

Antigenic dimorphism for RSV had been noted in an early study [42] and subsequently was delineated using MAbs, which identified extensive differences in the G protein and less extensive differences in F and other proteins [43]. The two subgroups exhibit a three- to fourfold reciprocal difference in neutralization by polyclonal convalescent serum. Analysis of glycoprotein-specific responses in experimental rodent models or human infants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified F and G glycoproteins showed that the F proteins are 50 % related antigenically and the G proteins are 1\u20137 % related [44]. Consistent with this level of antigenic relatedness, F protein expressed by a vector immunization was equally protective in small animals against challenge with the homologous or heterologous subgroup virus, whereas the G protein was 13-fold less effective against the heterologous subgroup virus [45]. Thus, the F protein is responsible for most of the observed cross-subgroup neutralization and protection. In some communities a pattern of infection with viruses of alternating subgroups has been described, but this is not a universal phenomenon. RSV subgroup B virus is more difficult to isolate and propagate in culture, so subgroup B viruses are less commonly associated with severe disease in some studies. However, clearly viruses of both subgroups can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization [46\u201350].",

First, the highest point of resistance in the airways is the bronchioles, and the resistance of airways is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fourth power (resistance ~ 1/radius4, from Poiseuille\u2019s law). The bronchioles of infants are narrow, and inflammation and secretion in the bronchioles leads to turbulent airflow, and further reduction of the airway lumen size. These physical factors lead to the clinical signs of wheezing (a sign of outflow obstruction) and air retention. Increased respiratory rate can compensate to some extent for respiratory compromise, but prolonged tachypnea can lead to fatigue and eventual respiratory failure. Also, during primary infection infants do not possess active immunity to infection, which allow this efficient virus to replicate in the airway to titers as high as 107 infectious particles per mL of secretion. Mothers pass RSV antibodies to infants across the placenta during the third trimester, but premature infants do not obtain maternal antibodies prior to 32 weeks\u2019 gestation. Also, the airways of premature infants are smaller than those of term infants. Another factor leading to respiratory difficulty is dehydration. Obstruction of the nasal passages with thick secretions can impede the feeding of infants, who are obligate nose breathers.",

Infants with congenital severe combined immunodeficiency are at special risk [57, 70], but any acquired immunosuppressive condition such as cancer or transplantation puts patients at risk, especially when T cell function is compromised [68, 71, 72]. RSV infection can cause severe lung disease in recipients of lung transplants, sometimes with a long-term outcome of obliterative bronchiolitis [73\u201375]. Children with HIV infection shed RSV for extended periods, but disease is not especially severe in HIV-infected children prior to onset of AIDS [76\u201378]. Interestingly, although most immunocompromised subjects appear to be at risk because of T cell problems, infants with phagocytic cell defects including those with interferon-\u03b3 receptor deficiency or chronic granulomatous disease also are at risk of severe RSV disease.",

Theoretically, transmission in inpatient healthcare settings should be preventable through strict compliance with infection control practices, especially hand washing and contact precautions, which are universally recommended for RSV patients. A high level of compliance with precautions is difficult to achieve in busy care settings but is needed to prevent transmission by healthcare providers. The use of the prophylactic monoclonal antibody palivizumab has been studied to interrupt an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit setting [89], but currently palivizumab use is not recommended for this purpose.",

Even though the same high proportion of both male and female infants become infected, males have a higher incidence of RSV lower respiratory tract disease than girls [30, 32, 105\u2013108].

In some cases, infected subjects may inoculate contacts at short distance by coughing via large-particle droplets. However, the virus is not spread efficiently by small-particle aerosols [110, 111]. The nasal and conjunctival mucus membranes are probably the most common portals of entry [112]. RSV is one of the most infectious viruses spread by contact, and transmission is very efficient even among subjects who possess partial immunity due to prior infection. Spread among family members and day-care contacts is especially common. The infectious doses for humans are probably only a few infectious particles per mL of respiratory secretions, but infants routinely shed at least a millionfold higher concentration of virus during the peak of illness. The incubation period is not known definitely but is about 3\u20136 days and likely varies according to the intensity of exposure and the amount of virus in the inoculum. The period of viral shedding is many days; infants can shed infectious virus for weeks [98, 99]. RSV can survive on hard surfaces for greater than 24 h.",

Virus replication initiates in the nasopharynx and rapidly can reach concentrations of over a million particles per mL in the upper airway in children. Adults, who are partially immune, typically shed much lower amounts of virus.

RSV replicates in the cells at the luminal surface of the respiratory epithelium and virus both enters and is shed from the apical surface of infected epithelial cells [119, 120].

It is unusual to observe frank bacterial pneumonia or sepsis as a complication of RSV infection, in contrast to some other respiratory viruses like influenza. Although some clinicians may empirically use antibiotics during infant pneumonia, there is no evidence that antibiotic therapy alters the course of RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Antimicrobial therapy should not be used in most cases of RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia because of the lack of benefit and risk of selection of antibiotic-resistant colonizing organisms. Nevertheless, there is some suggestion that bacterial-viral interactions may affect the overall rate of disease in the population. It is interesting that annual RSV and influenza virus epidemics correlate directly with the time of peak incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in many population studies [124]. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine showed a vaccine-attributable reduction in rates of childhood viral pneumonia requiring hospitalization, caused by any of seven respiratory viruses, including RSV [125].",

Most experts agree that high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies are associated with relative protection against severe lower respiratory tract disease in otherwise healthy subjects. This idea is supported strongly by the observation that prophylaxis of high-risk infants with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody prevents about half of hospitalizations in that group of patients. Many population studies suggest that infants born with high levels of transplacental RSV-neutralizing maternal antibodies develop milder illness or illness at an older age than infants with low maternal antibody levels [15]. Most infants and children in whom maternal antibodies have declined to a low level make their own serum and secretory antibodies to both the F and G surface glycoproteins in response to RSV infection [126]. Antibody responses in neonates are particularly low in quality and magnitude due to immunologic immaturity and the suppressive effect of passively acquired maternal antibodies [126, 127]. Antibody-mediated immune suppression by passive antibodies primarily affects humoral rather than cell-mediated immunity [128, 129]. High levels of serum antibodies do not appear to provide solid immunity against disease in the upper respiratory tract. Mucosal secretory IgA appears to contribute to local protection against reinfection in the airway, although potent protective IgA responses are likely relatively short lived. In human infants, the decrease in virus shedding in nasal secretions was associated with the appearance of RSV-specific IgA antibodies [130].",

There is often profuse rhinorrhea, and the upper tract disease is very often complicated by otitis media. Symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement occur in about a third of primary cases [28]. The principal diagnoses are bronchiolitis (manifested by tachypnea and wheezing) and pneumonia. These entities are probably not discrete processes but more likely represent a continuum of disease involving increasing tissue distribution. The typical illness starts with nasal congestion, followed in a few days by cough. The infection is sometimes associated with fever, which is usually low grade. After several days of upper tract symptoms, infants may wheeze. Many infants suffer mild wheezing that resolves, but some cases progress with tachypnea, diffuse inspiratory crackles, and expiratory wheezes. Most children recover in 1\u20132 weeks with supportive care and observation. If expiratory obstruction becomes severe, however, hyper-expansion of the chest occurs due to air retention, and the compliant nature of the infant chest wall leads to intercostal and subcostal retractions during tachypnea. With prolonged tachypnea, fatigue may occur with poor oxygenation and CO2 retention (measured by pulse oximeter or arterial blood gas measurement), markers of respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation is used in this setting to manage the respiratory failure.",

These events thankfully are usually self-limited and rarely cause neurologic damage. Apneic events are an indication for hospitalization and careful medical supervision with respiratory monitoring. Because of the association with apnea, some have considered whether RSV is associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although RSV has been detected in the lung tissues of some cases of SIDS, there is no statistically significant association between RSV and SIDS. The reported cases likely reflect a temporal association caused by the high prevalence of RSV in this age group, the prolonged pattern of shedding, and the simultaneous peak incidence of both RSV infection and SIDS in winter months [132].",

Certainly measureable pulmonary function abnormalities are common after RSV lower respiratory tract disease, and these findings may persist for a decade or more [133]. Recurrent wheezing is common during subsequent viral infections after severe RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia, with an incidence of 10\u201350 % [134]. A large case-control study of 200 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis or pneumonia in which RSV was the most common cause found that 7 years later there was a strong predisposition in these subjects toward decreased pulmonary function, recurrent cough, wheezing, and bronchitis [135]. Seminal prospective studies by Martinez et al. involved measurement of pulmonary function in infants at birth and then found a strong correlation between prior lower pulmonary function and the development of wheezing during RSV infection [136]. This correlation persisted in children during the first 3 years of life [136]. Even some individuals who do not typically exhibit recurrent wheezing have postexercise or pharmacologically induced bronchial reactivity [137], which may be responsive in part to bronchodilators [134].",

The guanosine (ribonucleic acid) analog ribavirin is a nucleoside inhibitor that inhibits viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. The drug has in vitro antiviral activity against RSV, and aerosolized ribavirin therapy has been associated with a small but statistically significant increase in oxygen saturation during the acute infection in several small studies. Decreases in mechanical ventilation and duration of RSV-associated hospitalization have not been proven (reviewed in [143]). Ribavirin was approved in 1986 in the USA for treatment of RSV infection [144]. Clinically, the drug usually is administered as a small-particle aerosol using a tent, mask, or mechanical ventilator, delivered for 6\u201318 h daily for a period of 3\u20137 days. The drug now is not recommended for routine use because follow-up studies have not shown a major benefit. The drug may be considered for use in select patients with documented, potentially life-threatening RSV infection. Over a dozen other experimental small molecule inhibitors of RSV fusion to cells have been described and tested in preclinical studies for inhibition of RSV, but none have progressed in development to date. A third approach employs short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), taking advantage of an ancient host cell regulatory system. Single-stranded and double-stranded RNA molecules that exhibit RSV-specific small interfering RNAs have been developed for treatment, which cause RNA interference activity against RSV, destroying the corresponding RSV RNA. These novel compounds have shown promising results in preclinical studies [145] and have been tested in small clinical trials. Human immune globulin with a high titer of RSV antibodies and the RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab have been tested as therapy of acute RSV disease, but they were not effective for treatment of established disease.",

These agents are not usually recommended for routine care of first-time wheezing associated with RSV bronchiolitis. Short-term improvements in oxygenation and clinical scores can be achieved by these therapies, but it has not been established that their use results in improvements in duration or severity of illness or disease outcomes. Studies in this area have been conflicting, but systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials of nebulized beta-agonist therapy for treatment of bronchiolitis suggest that they offer little benefit [148, 149]. Alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation results may decrease interstitial and mucosal edema [150], and use of nebulized epinephrine (with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity) has been studied with conflicting results [151, 152]. Alpha-agonist stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system is expected to reduce capillary leakage by constricting precapillary arterioles, reducing hydrostatic pressure and consequently bronchial mucosal edema [150]. Racemic epinephrine treatment relieves some respiratory distress but does not affect length of stay [153]. The usefulness of such agents in the management of RSV bronchiolitis is not clear.",

In the hospital setting, careful adherence to infection control practices is important for the protection of high-risk patients from RSV infection. Careful hand washing may reduce transmission in family and day-care settings. Pharmacologic intervention is indicated to prevent hospitalization for the highest risk infants, however. Passive RSV immunoprophylaxis with antibodies has proven a costly but relatively effective intervention. Parenteral infusion of RSV-neutralizing antibodies into experimental animals was shown early on to confer substantial resistance in the respiratory tract to a subsequent RSV virus challenge [154]. Significant reductions in RSV-associated hospitalizations and disease severity in high-risk human infants were first accomplished with prophylactic administration of human immunoglobulin with high RSV-neutralizing activity given by the intravenous route (RSV-IVIG; FDA licensed in 1996) [155, 156]. Monthly intravenous infusions during the RSV season reduced the frequency of pediatric hospitalization and duration of stay by approximately 55 % and decreased the number of days spent in intensive care by 97 %. The use of RSV-IVIG was superseded by the use of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that was developed subsequently that could be given by intramuscular route, and production of the former has been discontinued. Several MAbs were developed for immunoprophylaxis against RSV. The most successful of these was based on murine MAb 1129 [157], which is specific to the F protein and efficiently neutralizes viruses of both RSV subgroups A and B. This MAb was humanized by recombinant methods by transferring its variable regions onto a human IgG1 backbone, resulting in a recombinant antibody now named palivizumab [158]. This MAb is 50\u2013100-fold more effective for in vitro neutralization on a per weight basis than was RSV-IVIG, and thus the total amount of immunoglobulin administered could be reduced to an amount that could be given IM. Palivizumab (trade name Synagis) was licensed in 1998 for RSV prophylaxis of high-risk infants, following studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy [159\u2013162]. Palivizumab is administered monthly through the RSV season and has been widely used in high-risk patients with prematurity, chronic lung disease, and hemodynamically significant heart disease [163]. More potent derivatives of this recombinant antibody have now been developed [164]; however, the lead candidate from these affinity maturation efforts exhibited increased side effects in a large efficacy study.",

Vaccine development for RSV has proven exceptionally difficult, however. First, young infants are a difficult population to immunize. Obstacles to immunization at this early age include immunologic immaturity and immunosuppression by maternal antibodies, as already noted [165]. Also, severe adverse events occurred in early RSV vaccine trials. A formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine candidate (FI-RSV) was developed and evaluated in infants and children in the 1960s [166, 167]. This vaccine suspension was made by mixing concentrated, inactivated virus with alum adjuvant and was delivered by the intramuscular (IM) route. This inoculation did not protect against infection or disease, but rather during subsequent natural infection vaccinees experienced more frequent and severe disease. Most FI-RSV vaccinees (80 %) required hospitalization during subsequent natural infection, compared to 5 % in the control group. Autopsies of two fatalities showed evidence of RSV replication and pulmonary inflammation [167]. This event put a chilling effect on RSV vaccine development efforts. Therefore, RSV protein vaccines have been problematic for use in infants given their possible potential for disease enhancement, together with the poor immunogenicity in this population.",

One experimental subunit vaccine consisted of purified F protein (PFP) isolated from RSV-infected cell culture. This purified protein vaccine candidate was evaluated in adults, in older children with and without underlying medical diseases, and in the elderly [168]. The PFP vaccine candidate was well tolerated and moderately immunogenic in these settings. A large multicenter study in children 1\u201312 years of age with cystic fibrosis did not provide evidence of significant protection against RSV infection [169]. PFP also has been evaluated for maternal immunization in the third trimester of pregnancy. In the single study to date, the increase in antibody titers was only minimal [170].

Currently, there is little to offer for therapy except for supportive care. Prophylaxis of high-risk infant with a MAb prevents some hospitalizations but is expensive and is not always effective. There are no licensed vaccines. Given the disaster of early FI-RSV trials, it is not clear that a non-replicating vaccine can be proven safe enough in preclinical models to absolutely assure that enhanced disease will not occur. On the other hand, the explosion of new technologies for generation of recombinant RSV strains, the determination of pre- and post-fusion antigen structures, and new tools for the detailed study of the molecular and genetic basis of human immune responses suggest that much progress will be made in the RSV research field in the coming years.",

Epidemiologic studies have since confirmed that MPV is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. MPV causes many hospitalizations annually in young children and presumably deaths in developing nations. Children with comorbid conditions including prematurity, immune compromise, and chronic cardiopulmonary disease are at higher risk for severe disease. However, the majority of MPV-associated hospitalizations occur in otherwise healthy infants and children. Conversely, while MPV is associated with severe lower respiratory infection in adults at rates similar to those of influenza virus and RSV, almost all of the MPV infections in this population are in patients with comorbidities. MPV causes predictable annual outbreaks with late winter-early spring predominance in temperate regions. Substantial progress has been made in defining the biology, pathogenesis, and immunology of the virus. Small animal and nonhuman primate models of MPV have been developed and used to elucidate mechanisms of immunopathogenesis and test candidate vaccines. A variety of vaccine approaches against MPV are under study, including recombinant subunit, vectored, and live-attenuated vaccines. Human and murine monoclonal antibodies have been generated that exhibit potent in vivo efficacy in rodent models. A subset of integrins with a binding site for a natural ligand that contains an Arg-Gly-Glu (RGD) motif (RGD-binding integrins) has been identified as receptors that mediate MPV attachment and entry via an RGD motif in the MPV fusion protein. Remarkable scientific progress has been made during the decade since the discovery of MPV.",

Electron microscopy of infected cells revealed pleomorphic enveloped particles with surface projections suggesting protein spikes, while biochemical experiments showed that the virus contained a lipid envelope and did not hemagglutinate avian or mammalian red blood cells. Elegant randomly primed RT-PCR experiments yielded multiple fragments of genome, which sequence analysis identified as related to avian metapneumovirus (AMPV).",

The original isolation of MPV in tertiary monkey kidney cells was possible because the investigator had access to a monkey kidney cell source that was free of the endogenous simian foamy virus (A.D.M.E. Osterhaus, personal communication). Primary monkey kidney cells commercially available in the USA all contain SFV, and even the addition of anti-SFV antisera cannot prevent the growth of this endogenous virus prior to the slow emergence of MPV. Further, the fusion protein of MPV requires cleavage by exogenous trypsin for robust in vitro growth. Trypsin is added by most clinical virology laboratories only to cultures of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for the isolation of influenza virus; however, MDCK cells are very poorly permissive for MPV even in the presence of trypsin. Finally, primary isolation of MPV often requires one or more passages prior to visible CPE and few laboratories routinely follow this procedure. Unlike RSV, MPV is not particularly labile to freeze-thaw cycles [183] and thus can be retrospectively isolated from PCR-positive specimens. Fluorescent antibody staining of patient specimens or shell vial cultures can facilitate more rapid identification [184\u2013187].",

A number of sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assays have been described [188\u2013195]. Many early assays were based on limited sequence data and subsequently were found to be suboptimal for detecting multiple diverse strains [195]. Both individual and multiplexed RT-PCR assays offer more sensitive detection of MPV than culture; however, multiplex assays sometimes balance decreased sensitivity for a single agent with the convenience of detecting multiple viruses simultaneously [196]. Another limitation of molecular detection for all viruses is the ability to detect low levels of viral nucleic acid in the absence of infectious virus. It has become common to detect more than one virus in a single specimen, and the interpretation of these data is far from clear. Community respiratory viral infections are frequent in childhood, and the likelihood of detecting viral genome prior to the onset of illness or for prolonged periods after illness resolution complicates the assignment of causation to one of several co-detected viruses.",

However, subsequent experiments using hamsters, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques found that the A and B groups were 64\u201399 % related antigenically [219]. Infected animals developed neutralizing antibodies that were highly effective against heterologous virus, and previously infected primates were protected against challenge with heterologous virus. Cynomolgus macaques infected with A or B subgroup viruses or with candidate vaccines exhibited only a 6\u201316-fold difference in neutralizing titer against homologous and heterologous viruses [220, 221].

Serosurveys testing large sample collections in Canada, China, Croatia, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Thailand, the USA, and Uruguay show that 95\u2013100 % of children have antibodies against MPV by the age of 5 years [222\u2013231]. In many of these studies, 50\u201375 % of children are seropositive by age 2 years, suggesting that most acquire primary MPV infection early. Most identify a decrease in serum MPV antibody titer from birth to 6\u201312 months, presumably due to the expected decline of maternally derived antibodies. Studies in Japan and India that compared MPV and RSV titers in the same cohort found that after the expected nadir during early infancy, RSV titers began increasing at an earlier age than MPV [232, 233]. This finding is interesting in light of epidemiologic data suggesting that primary MPV infection peaks between 6 and 12 months of life compared with the peak of RSV at 2\u20133 months (discussed below). Longitudinal studies in adults and children have documented reinfection by a fourfold rise in serum antibody titer [222, 230, 231, 234\u2013237].",

A 2-years multicenter study of inpatient and outpatient Japanese children with ARI identified MPV in 57/637 (8.9 %) [239].

A prospective study in Rochester, NY, enrolled four cohorts during four winters: healthy adults >65, high-risk adults >65 with comorbidities, healthy adults 19\u201340 years old, and adults hospitalized for acute cardiopulmonary illness [246, 247]. Overall, MPV infection was detected in 8.5 % of ARI in the cohort. The rate of MPV infection was highest in young adults at 13 %, though many of these were asymptomatic and detected only serologically. Of note, this group had a mean age of 33, was predominantly female, and had daily exposure to children. Of the hospitalized patients, the incidence of MPV annually ranged from 4.4 to 13.2 %. More than 85 % of the hospitalized MPV-infected subjects had underlying conditions, chiefly cardiopulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus. There were six deaths in this study, all with comorbidities; one had concomitant bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, the incidence of MPV infection was similar to the annual average infection rate for RSV (5.5 %) and influenza A (2.4 %) in these cohorts during the same study period.",

Notably, MPV-infected subjects were significantly older than influenza-infected subjects (mean 76 vs. 60 years) and had higher rates of chronic cardiopulmonary disease (78 % vs. 52 %). The overall population-based rates of hospitalization for the three viruses were similar, at 1/1,000 for MPV, 1.5/1,000 RSV, and 1.2/1,000 for influenza. However, for subjects \u226565 years, hospitalization rates were much higher for MPV and RSV at 2.2/1,000 for MPV and 2.5/1,000 for RSV compared to 1.2/1,000 for influenza, likely reflecting the use of influenza vaccine for older adults. A prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia in Canada found MPV in 4 % of hospitalized cases during an 18-month period, all with underlying conditions [249]. A Dutch group detected MPV in 2 % of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from intensive care unit patients. All were >50 years old with comorbid conditions and 83 % died [250]. Similarly, a retrospective study in North Ireland found MPV in only 0.8 % of residual respiratory specimens from adults, but 33 % of these died [251]. Together, these data show that MPV is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, primarily older adults or those with underlying comorbid conditions.",

Early protection against reinfection following primary infection was confirmed in macaques; however, when challenged 12 weeks later, virus replication was detectable despite the presence of serum antibodies [220]. Eleven months later, antibody levels had waned still further, and all macaques challenged with heterologous virus and two of three animals reinfected with homologous virus had no evidence of protection [220]. A prospective study in humans noted that baseline MPV antibodies were lower in patients who subsequently became infected versus those who did not become infected [321].

There are no licensed antivirals for MPV. Reports of pharmacologic treatment of MPV are limited to severely ill or immunocompromised patients. Ribavirin, an antiviral agent used in severe RSV infection, reduced inflammation and viral replication in mice with MPV infection [333]. Commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), ribavirin, and NMSO3 (a sulfated sialyl lipid) effectively inhibited MPV in vitro [334, 335]. Ribavirin, with and without IVIG, has been used in immunocompromised adults [336]. Bonney and colleagues [337] reported successful treatment of an immunocompromised child with MPV using IV ribavirin and IVIG. Subsequently, oral ribavirin and inhaled ribavirin with IVIG have been used [275, 338]. However, no randomized, controlled trials have been conducted, and these data should be regarded as purely anecdotal.",

A recombinant parainfluenza virus encoding the MPV F protein demonstrated protection against MPV [339], and soluble F protein vaccines reduced viral titers in cotton rats and hamsters [207, 208]. Reverse genetics technology has been developed for MPV and has been used to produce recombinant strains for vaccine development [197, 340].

Abundant evidence shows that MPV is a significant cause of acute respiratory disease, especially in the very young, older adults, and persons with underlying conditions. As with all mucosal viruses, the short incubation period of MPV combined with the transient nature of mucosal IgA means that reinfection is possible throughout life. However, serum IgG appears to offer protection against severe lower respiratory involvement, and thus a vaccine would likely ameliorate the most severe cases. The best candidate vaccine is not yet clear. Further, MPV has as yet unidentified mechanisms to subvert host immunity. Elucidation of these pathways might help guide vaccine development and uncover novel host targets for immunomodulation.",
