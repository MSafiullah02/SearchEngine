Although legionellosis is traditionally associated with two distinct illnesses (Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever), a wide spectrum of illness ranging from mild cough to pneumonia was observed at both nursing homes. Therefore, for the casecontrol study, a case definition was developed that could account for the spectrum of illness observed. Cases of Legionella infection were defined as residents present in the nursing home at the time of the outbreak who met any one of the following criteria: (1) a fourfold rise in Legionella serum antibodies to a titer 21:128; (2) a positive urine Legionella antigen test; (3) at least one respiratory symptom or sign and a single serologic convalescent titre 21:256; (4) three or more symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection; or (5) two or more symptoms or signs and an infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Although Legionella species are widely distributed in the environment, and outbreaks of legionellosis have been well described,3-8B20 only one previous outbreak in a nursing home has been reported.' Although it is possible that the outbreaks in these two nursing homes represent very unusual events, we believe that it is more likely that Legionella infection in nursing homes is frequently unrecognized: the discovery of a Legionella outbreak in nursing home A led investigators at nursing home B to consider the diagnosis of legionellosis. One of the reasons why legionellosis in nursing homes may be unrecognized is that its clinical features are nonspecific. Respiratory tract illness indistinguishable from that caused by a virus was the most common clinical presentation of L. sainthelensi infection in these two outbreaks. The clinical features of our cases resembled those reported previously for patients with infection caused by L. ~aintheleizsi,'~~'~ with illnesses ranging from persistent cough, to acute bronchitis, to pneumonia. The incidence of documented pneumonia (14%) in these two outbreaks was less than that in the single previously reported nursing home outbreak of legionellosis, in which nearly a third of symptomatic individuals had pneumonia.' However, neither the respiratory illness that predominated in our outbreaks nor Legionefla pneumonia have clinical features that permit the distinction of etiology. This investigation shows that legionellosis should be considered in outbreaks of undiagnosed respiratory infection in nursing homes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Standard definitions of either community-acquired or nosocomial infections are often not applicable to most longterm care facilities.2' These standard definitions often make use of laboratory tests and radiology facilities that are usually not readily available in nursing homes.

Because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate respiratory or serological specimens from nursing home resident^:^.^^ a broad spectrum urinary ELISA\" was used, allowing for a prompt, convenient, and accurate method of detecting legionellosis* 18.24 The exact mode of transmission of infection with Legionella has long been debat~d.~' There is evidence to support both aspiration and inhalation of contaminated water as modes of transmission of i n f e c t i~n .~?~~ Potable water, water from cooling towers, and aerosols from other devices have been identified as sources of i n f e~t i o n .~*~' *~~*~~ In our investigation we were unable to identify sources of contaminated aerosols such as cooling towers. Measurements of distances to potential sources of aerosolization were not significant in the multivariable analysis. Residents of long-term care facilities commonly have underlying conditions (such as stroke) that predispose to aspiration.2Y In these two facilities, as in many nursing homes, very few residents had formal evaluations for swallowing difficulties. However, the most common reason for placement on a pureed diet in the two nursing homes was the perception by nursing and medical staff of swallowing difficulties. That surrogate markers for aspiration were significant in both the univariate analysis (stroke, having fluids or semifluids mixed with medication, a pureed diet) and the multivariable analysis (pureed diet) provides supporting evidence for aspiration as the mode of transmission of infection in these outbreaks.

However virologic and serologic investigations did not detect other infectious agents in these residents.
