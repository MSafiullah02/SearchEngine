            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus first isolated in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (Guan et al., 2020). The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from COVID-19. Virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and the United States and epicenters in large urban cities. Most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 April 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at \u223c4%. The extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. Rapid implementation and deployment of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return.",

The M and E proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the S protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. Interactions between the M glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. The small structural E protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed.

In some circumstances, the S protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [HA], HIV-1 [gp160], and Ebola [glycoprotein, GP]). This class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments, followed by further processing of S2 to yield a smaller S2\u2032 protein. Cleavage also may occur during viral egress. The S1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), whereas the carboxyl terminal S2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. The structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5\u00c5 using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the SARS-CoV S protein (Figure 1B; Wrapp et al., 2020). Both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the RBD.",

This technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus (NCT03076385 and NCT03345043) and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including ZIKV. Developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in collaboration with Moderna, mRNA-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mRNA expressing a prefusion-stabilized S protein. The design of the S protein antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class I fusion proteins of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses (Pallesen et al., 2017). These studies identified stabilizing proline substitutions in the central helix of S2 that reduced the fusion activity and allowed high-level expression of trimeric S in an antigenically native prefusion context. The structure of the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 has been solved (Figure 1B). A phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1273 (NCT04283461) was initiated in March of 2020 as an open-label, dose-ranging study in 45 subjects who were administered the vaccine in two doses 29 days apart. Subjects will be followed for 12 months following the second dose for safety, with immunogenicity as a secondary objective.",

(2) Do some of the assays commonly used in vitro to measure neutralization (e.g., pseudotyped viruses) faithfully predict protective activity in vivo? (3) What is the role of non-neutralizing anti-S antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells? Could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via Fc-\u03b3-receptor interactions? (4) What is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination? (5) Are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames (ORFs) important for immunity, especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly? And (6) how important are CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection?

Pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389), likely because mouse ACE2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020). Transgenic mice that express human ACE2 (hACE2-Tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing.

            "text": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing Fc-\u03b3 or complement receptors. ADE of DENV infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of DENV or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal DENV-immune IgG. ADE is an obstacle for DENV-vaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by DENV-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine Dengvaxia. Through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (Vennema et al., 1990). In cell culture experiments, SARS-CoV entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-S antibodies through both Fc-\u03b3-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Jaume et al., 2011, Wan et al., 2020). Extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ADE assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo. This may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ADE assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. The inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many in vitro assays, reduces enhancement in an IgG subclass-dependent manner. ADE has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of DENV infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral T cells. Coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. Is the infection of Fc-\u03b3-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to COVID-19 disease severity? Studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. For DENV, the most compelling evidence for a role of ADE in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans.",

Enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a Th2-directed T cell response (Ruckwardt et al., 2019). Immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. While preclinical studies of multiple SARS-CoV vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar Th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (Bolles et al., 2011). The structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. Based on recent progress in RSV vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion S epitopes together with a Th1 T cell response may be key features of a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

            "text": "The development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. This traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. Although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. Against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. However, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. Studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. In this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.",
