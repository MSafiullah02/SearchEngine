Currently, most hematopoietic transplants are performed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies [1] . Hematopoietic cells for transplantation can be collected from various sources including bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood. Autologous transplants utilize the patient's own cells, whereas allogeneic transplants utilize cells obtained from a different individual. Syngeneic transplants are between genetically identical twins. Conditioning therapy given prior to hematopoietic transplantation can be myeloablative or non-myeloablative (i.e., reduced intensity) and produces significant neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] \u2264500 cells/mm 3 ), which is the most common predisposing factor for the development of bacterial and fungal infections during the pre-engraftment phase. Neutropenia is more prolonged in recipients of myeloablative allogeneic transplants than in recipients of non-myeloablative or autologous transplants. Thus, the frequency and severity of infection in allogeneic transplant recipients are greater than in other transplant subgroups [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Some patients with hematologic malignancies may have normal or even elevated ANCs but may be at increased risk for infection due to defects in neutrophil function (qualitative neutropenia). These defects include significant reduction in phagocytosis, decreased bac-tericidal and fungicidal activity, decreased production of superoxide anions, and defects in granulocyte locomotion. Myeloablative conditioning regimens also inflict substantial damage to mucosal barriers causing mucositis of the mouth and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased risk of infections arising from these sites [7, 8] . Early recognition and aggressive management of infection is critical for the overall survival of hematopoietic transplant recipients, and delays in the administration of appropriate anti-infective therapy are associated with poorer outcomes [9] . Unfortunately, signs and symptoms commonly associated with infection may be blunted in these highly immunosuppressed patients. Often the only manifestation of infection during an episode of neutropenia is fever. This condition is commonly referred to as \"febrile neutropenia.\" The widely accepted definition of febrile neutropenia is an oral temperature of \u226538.3 \u00b0C, or two consecutive readings of >38 \u00b0C during a 2 h period, and an absolute neutrophil count of <500/mm 3 [10] . It has been estimated that approximately 80% of allogeneic transplant recipients and a smaller but substantial proportion of allogeneic transplant recipients will develop febrile neutropenia. It is important to keep in mind that some neutropenic patients, especially those receiving corticosteroids, may not mount an adequate inflammatory response and may be afebrile or even hypothermic while developing or harboring a significant infection. A high index of suspicion and close monitoring during periods of increased risk is essential in such patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 245, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1235, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1243, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1247, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1251, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1853, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1856, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2100, "end": 2103, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2577, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2582, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The administration of prompt, broad-spectrum, empiric, antimicrobial therapy has become the standard of care for most febrile neutropenic patients including transplant recipients [10] .

A specific causative pathogen, most often bacterial or fungal, is identified in only 20-25% of febrile neutropenic episodes, referred to as episodes of microbiologically documented infection [14] . An additional 20-25% of patients will have an identifiable site of infection (e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis, enterocolitis) but will have negative cultures ( Fig. 9.1 ). This may be due to various reasons such as the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis which may render cultures negative or substantially delay the time to positivity or a blunted inflammatory response which can result in paucity of specimens (e.g., sputum) to culture. These episodes are referred to as clinically documented infections. Approximately 40-50% of febrile neutropenic patients have neither clinical evidence of infection nor positive microbiological documentation of one, which are referred to as episodes of unexplained fever. The majority of these episode are probably caused by undetected infections as most of them respond to empiric antimicrobial therapy. A small proportion of patients with fever and neutropenia have noninfectious causes of fever such as drug fever or tumor fever. This is not surprising since fever is induced by cytokine release which is not limited to infections. All febrile neutropenic patients should undergo a thorough evaluation to detect infection before the possibility of a noninfectious etiology is entertained. Most microbiologically documented infections are monomicrobial (i.e., caused by one organism) with Gram-positive bacteria being predominant [10, 15] . However, polymicrobial infections are being documented with increasing frequency at many transplant centers and may account for up to 25% of bacterial infections [16] . Recent data show that ~10-15% of bacteremias in neutropenic patients are polymicrobial [17] . Infections involving deep tissue sites such as pneumonia, enterocolitis, and perirectal infections are often polymicrobial [16, 18] . Most polymicrobial infections are caused by multiple bacterial species although bacterial and fungal, bacterial and viral, or fungal and viral infections may be present at the same time. These infections are generally associated with greater morbidity and mortality than monomicrobial infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 404, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1775, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1779, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1948, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2042, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2172, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2176, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 571, "text": "Fig. 9.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Types of Febrile Episodes"}, {"text": "The most common sites of infection documented in neutropenic hematopoietic transplant recipients are listed in Table 9 .1.

Less frequent but clinically important sites include the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, and the end organs such as the spleen and liver. The frequency of bloodstream infection (BSI) varies from center to center and also on the type of transplant, generally being more frequent in allogeneic transplant recipients [19, 20] . Recent data indicate that the incidence of at least one episode of BSI is around 21% with an attributable mortality of ~3% [21] . Approximately 25% of patients with profound neutropenia lasting >10-12 days will develop lung infiltrates. These often do not respond to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and establishing a specific diagnosis in such patients remains a significant challenge [22] . Data regarding other sites of infection are not as robust as those describing BSIs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 450, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 921, "end": 925, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1193, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 118, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Sites of Infection"}, {"text": "unexplained fever 45 -50% clinically documented infections 20 -25% (predominantly respiratory and SSIs) microbiologically documented infections 20-25% (predominantly bacterial and fungal) non infectious causes of fever <5% (predominantly drug and tumor fever) Most microbiologically documented infections arise from the patient's endogenous microflora, with only a small proportion being acquired from exogenous sources and/or environmental exposure. It is therefore often possible to anticipate the potential etiology of an infection and provide appropriate empiric coverage based on the site where the infection originated. For example, most infections with a cutaneous origin are caused by Staphylococcus species and other organisms that colonize the skin (Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Candida spp.) [23] . Patients with severe oral mucositis and/or poor periodontal status are more likely to have infections caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS) and Stomatococcus mucilaginosus [24] [25] [26] . In patients with significant lower intestinal mucositis, enterococcal and Gram-negative bacillary infections occur more often. Bacterial infections generally occur during the initial stages of a neutropenic episode, while fungal infections arise more frequently in patients with prolonged (\u22657 days) neutropenia. The widespread use of long-term central venous catheters in transplant recipients has had an impact on the frequency and spectrum of infection. The ability of certain organisms (notably coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp.) to produce and get embedded in biofilm, and the poor penetration of many antimicrobial agents into biofilm, makes catheter-related infections difficult to eradicate without removal of the offending catheter [27] . Consequently many transplant centers perform routine weekly blood cultures from central venous catheters in an attempt to detect colonization/infection early [28, 29] . This practice, however, has not been shown to accurately predict the development of CLABSI and may lead to unnecessary interventions [30] . The most common organisms isolated from CLABSI are CoNS. Other organisms include S. aureus, Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Candida spp. Despite the widespread use of catheters, the infection rate seldom exceeds 15% or more than two episodes per 1000 catheter days [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 815, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1005, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1804, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1969, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1973, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2113, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2507, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sites of Infection"}, {"text": "Several recent epidemiologic surveys conducted in pediatric and adult hematopoietic transplant recipients have documented the predominance of Gram-positive organisms over Gram-negative bacilli [32] [33] [34] . Some of the reasons for this predominance include (1) the widespread use of central venous catheters, (2) the frequent use of intensive chemotherapeutic regimens that produce significant oral mucositis, and (3) the use of antibacterial prophylaxis (generally with a fluoroquinolone) directed primarily against enteric Gram-negative bacilli. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis has in fact been show to increase the frequency of Grampositive infections especially with organisms such as VGS that are often resistant to them [35] . The proportion of Gram-positive infections has been reported to be as high as 70-80% at some centers. Many reports, however, include data only on BSI caused by single organisms (monomicrobial BSI) and either exclude or provide very little details regarding infections at other sites and on polymicrobial infections [36] . These reports provide an overestimate of Gram-positive infections since the majority of bacteremias, particularly CLABSI, are indeed caused by Gram-positive organisms that inhabit the skin. As mentioned previously, BSIs account for only 20-25% of microbiologically documented infections. Infections at most other sites such as lungs, intestinal tract, urinary tract, and biliary tract have a predominance of Gram-negative pathogens. Additionally, ~60-80% of polymicrobial infections have a Gram-negative component, and ~30-35% are caused exclusively by multiple Gram-negative species [16, 18] . Therefore, when all sites of infection, not just BSI and monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial infections are pooled together, the apparent predominance of Gram-positive organisms seems less striking, with Gram-negative organisms being isolated almost as frequently [37] . Indeed, some institutions are beginning to report a resurgence in the frequency of Gram-negative pathogens even in patients with BSI [32] . The main reason for this appears to be the discontinuation of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at some institutions since this practice has resulted in the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant and even multidrug-resistant organisms [32] . For reasons that remain unclear anaerobes are seldom isolated from neutropenic patients, although it is customary to provide anaerobic coverage especially for infections arising from or involving the intestinal tract.

These organisms are of low virulence and seldom cause life-threatening infections even in severely neutropenic patients. CLABSI are the most common infections caused by CoNS. These can often be treated with antimicrobial agents alone, although catheter removal may be required if the infection recurs [38] . The one exception is S. lugdunensis, which more closely resembles S. aureus in virulence [39] [40] [41] . Many experts recommend that these organisms should not be considered to be harmless commensals and infections caused by them should be managed like those caused by S. aureus. Other Gram-positive organisms that colonize the human skin and cause infections in neutropenic patients include Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Micrococcus spp. Like CoNS, these organisms cause CLABSI most often, although serious infections such as endophthalmitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, and pneumonia develop occasionally. As mentioned, S. aureus are more virulent than other staphylococci and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Patients with S. aureus bacteremia should be evaluated with infections such as endocarditis and deep-seated abscesses [42] . Unlike CoNS catheter removal is almost always necessary in S. aureus CLABSI [43] . Of concern are the increasing rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus (MRSA) isolates worldwide. Although MRSA rates as low as 10% are still reported occasionally, many institutions are reporting MRSA rates in the range of 55-60%, making them more common than methicillin-susceptible isolates. Some MRSA isolates have developed tolerance (MBC \u226532 times the MIC) or reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (referred to as the MIC creep), thereby reducing the therapeutic impact of this agent, which until recently has been considered to be the agent of choice for the treatment of Gram-positive infections in neutropenic patients [44, 45] . Alternative agents are being recommended for infections caused by such organisms [46] . Alpha-hemolytic streptococci or VGS are major components of the human oral microflora. Patients particularly prone to VGS infections are recipients of high-intensity chemotherapy with agents such as cytosine arabinoside which induces severe mucosal damage and facilitates translocation of these organisms into the bloodstream. Other predisposing factors include the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and the use of antacids and histamine type-2 (H2) antagonists. Although not recommended by most authorities, vancomycin-based prophylaxis in the peri-transplant period has been used by some, in order to reduce the frequency of VGS bacteremia [47] . This practice requires close monitoring of patients for the development of resistant organisms such as VRE and/or staphylococcal isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin. It should only be considered in institutions where the frequency of infections caused by VGS is very high. Also of concern is the possibility that this practice might lead to the development of reduced susceptibility to other agents (daptomycin, dalbavancin). Some investigators believe that mucositis, which generally occurs at the nadir of neutropenia, is the primary predisposing factor for the development of infection in this setting, and have coined the phrase \"febrile mucositis.\" Additionally, periodontal inflammation including gingivitis, periodontitis increases the possibility of VGS bacteremia [24, 48] . The most common manifestation of VGS infection is bacteremia. Approximately 5-10% of patients may develop disseminated infection, the so-called streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in which the mortality rate is in the range of 40-50% despite appropriate therapy [49] . Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius are the species isolated most often from patients with VGS bacteremia. Of increasing concern are reports that up to 20-60% of VGS isolates are non-susceptible or overtly resistant to penicillin [50] . All isolates are currently susceptible to vancomycin, although occasional tolerance to this agent has been described [45] . They are also susceptible to newer-generation quinolones such as moxifloxacin and agents such as linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, and dalbavancin, although clinical experience with these agents is limited [51] [52] [53] . The use of antibiotic combinations may be warranted, especially against organisms with high MICs or tolerance to vancomycin. The enterococci reside mainly in the lower intestinal tract. They are seldom primary pathogens but are isolated most often following prolonged therapy with broad-spectrum agents such as the carbapenems. The most common manifestations include BSI and urinary tract infections. Enterococci are also often isolated from polymicrobial infections such as neutropenic enterocolitis and perirectal infections. The increased and prolonged use of vancomycin in neutropenic patients was in part responsible for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) globally, and currently, 15-20% of all enterococcal isolates in the United States are VRE. Fecal colonization with VRE in hematopoietic transplant recipients is not uncommon, and approximately 15-40% of colonized patients will develop BSI or other serious infections [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Consequently, some experts recommend the preemptive use of agents with activity against VRE when patients with fecal colonization develop febrile neutropenia. Fecal decolonization has been attempted, but most attempts have been unsuccessful. Therefore, antimicrobial stewardship and infection control measures to limit the emergence and spread of VRE are extremely important.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 550, "end": 554, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 555, "end": 559, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 560, "end": 564, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1418, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2063, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2151, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2797, "end": 2801, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3606, "end": 3610, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3611, "end": 3614, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3878, "end": 3882, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 4130, "end": 4134, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 4254, "end": 4258, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4468, "end": 4472, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 4473, "end": 4477, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 4478, "end": 4482, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 5434, "end": 5438, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 5439, "end": 5443, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 5444, "end": 5448, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 5449, "end": 5453, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 5454, "end": 5458, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gram-Positive Organisms"}, {"text": "The gastrointestinal tract serves as an important source of infection in neutropenic patients, with the predominant pathogens being enteric Gram-negative bacilli. The use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in high-risk neutropenic patients including hematopoietic transplant recipients led to a decline in the frequency and, to some extent, the morbidity and mortality associated with documented Gram-negative infections. This practice also led to the emergence of resistance among Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative species [59] [60] [61] . Therefore, many institutions are re-evaluating this practice, and some institutions have even discontinued fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in neutropenic patients [32] . Many institutions conduct surveillance studies in high-risk patients looking for fecal colonization with VRE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other resistant organisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), since positive surveillance cultures often predict the development of infections during subsequent episodes of neutropenia [55, 62, 63] . This information is useful in picking appropriate empiric regimens when colonized patients develop febrile neutropenia, as well as in antimicrobial stewardship efforts if surveillance cultures are negative. ESBL-producing organisms are being reported with increasing frequency [64] . Carbapenemaseproducing Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase, KPC; New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, NDM-1; non-metallo-beta-lactamase producers) have emerged over the past few years and are spreading across the globe [65, 66] . Gram-negative infections are usually associated with greater morbidity and mortality than Gram-positive infections. Many epidemiological studies have shown that E. coli, Klebsiella species (K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca), and P. aeruginosa remain the three primary Gram-negative pathogens in neutropenic patients causing 45-60% of such infections [36, 37] . Other Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia spp.) are less common, although institutional differences do exist [67, 68] . Nationwide outbreaks of Serratia marcescens bacteremia due to contaminated prefilled heparin and saline syringes have been reported [69, 70] . Despite the overall decline in the frequency of Gram-negative infections, the proportion of infections caused by non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) such as P. aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonads, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter species has increased [67, 71] . Collectively, NFGNB now cause ~40% of all Gram-negative infections, a proportion that has steadily increased over the past two decades. P. aeruginosa is the most important and most frequently isolated NFGNB and causes between 15% and 20% of Gram-negative infections [72] . Bacteremia and pneumonia are the two most common manifestations, although infections at various other sites are not uncommon. It is also the most common Gramnegative organism isolated from polymicrobial infections [16] . These organisms develop resistance to antimicrobial agents using multiple mechanisms and often acquire resistance to several classes of agents (multidrug resistance, MDR) and are difficult to treat and eradicate. Combination therapy is often necessary. Prolonged use of fluoroquinolones and carbapenems has been identified as risk factor for the development of resistance [73] [74] [75] . Consequently, many antimicrobial stewardship efforts focus on curtailing or minimizing the use of these agents. Colonization/infection with S. maltophilia is also being reported more often especially in patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic transplant recipients [76, 77] . The shift from trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (which has potent activity against S. maltophilia) to fluoroquinolones (which do not) as the preferred agents for antimicrobial prophylaxis in neutropenic patients may account for this increase. These organisms are almost always multidrug resistant, and as is the case with P. aeruginosa, combination therapy (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole + minocycline or tigecycline) is frequently necessary [77, 78] .
