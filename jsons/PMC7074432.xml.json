However, lack of control group hindered the estimation of true effect size. Again, in vitro testing did not show efficacy of ribavirin against SARS-CoV. Ribavirin is known for its side effects (hemolytic anemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia). Many subsequent studies questioned the efficacy of ribavirin. Many patients on ribavirin and corticosteroid combination even showed an increase in viral load following the treatment. Thus, its use declined over a period.[8] Other important nucleoside analogs are favipiravir and galidesivir, but these are not evaluated till now in 2019-nCoV.",

Among protease inhibitors, lopinavir was the most inhibitor and saquinavir was the least powerful inhibitor of CoV protease.[13] In molecular dynamic studies, flap closing was observed when these inhibitors bound to the SARS-CoV 3CL (pro).[14] Hong Kong University researchers demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV action of lopinavir at concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml in vitro against the HKU-39849 isolate.[15] Ritonavir boosting along with lopinavir is used in the management of HIV.[16] A clinical study at the same Hong Kong University suggests that even after adjustment for LDH level (possible confounder), a significant association was seen between lopinavir/ritonavir use and better outcome.[15] As per the current guidelines, lopinavir + ritonavir is the recommended protease inhibitor for the treatment of 2019-nCoV (weak recommendation).[17]",

Cytotoxicity was evaluated in vero E6 cells, which was followed by infection of the cells with 2019-nCoV clinical isolates, and the test drug was evaluated at different doses. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based quantification was done to get the viral yield, which was later confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (nucleocapsid protein visualization). Both chloroquine and remdesivir inhibited virus infection at micromolar level (0.77\u20131.13 \u03bcM) and with high selectivity.[33]",

Chloroquine even showed efficacy as a potent antiviral against SARS-CoV infection and spread.[35] Pretreatment with chloroquine renders vero E6 cells refractory to SARS CoV infection. Moreover, in the postinfection period, treatment with chloroquine prevents the spread of SARS-CoV infection.[35] Chloroquine increases endosomal pH and thus makes the environment unfavorable for the virus/cell fusion. Chloroquine also affects the glycosylation process of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2, receptor for binding of viral spike protein, which is essential for interaction with the host).[35] Being nonexpensive and easily available agent, chloroquine may prove as a promising candidate.",

Thus, AAK1 represents an important target. Richardson et al., 2020 evaluated 378 ligands, of which 47 were already approved for use in other conditions. Among these ligands, six inhibited AAK1 with high affinity. Considering the side effect profile, they found janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib to be the most important agent. In addition to AAK1, baricitinib also binds to another endocytosis regulator protein (cyclin G-associated kinase). Thus, the authors suggest that baricitinib can be evaluated in the in vitro conditions as well as in the clinical trial settings for 2019-nCoV.[37]",
