            "text": "The universe we occupy and time itself came into existence around 13 billion years ago, as proposed by the big bang theory.18 The universe is composed of galaxies. The galaxies (eg, the Milky Way) have several solar systems. Our solar system is composed of the sun and the revolving planets, of which the earth is one. The diameter of the Milky Way is 100,000 light years (a light year is the distance [6 trillion miles] that light, speeding at 186,300 miles/s, travels in 1 year [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/html/home.html]). The planet earth appeared approximately 4.55 billion years ago. However, only in 1543 ad did Nicolas Copernicus place the sun and not the planet earth as the center of the solar system. This created a period of theological and psychological turmoil to many at the time, given that now the earth and human life were no longer at the epicenter of all universal events. Thus, the Ptolemaic system gave way to the Copernican system.18 Early man (homo habilis) appeared around 2.5 million years ago, with modern man (homo sapiens) beginning migratory patterns around 60,000 years ago. With Africa as the start, migration proceeded to Australia (50,000 years ago), the Middle East (45,000 years ago), Asia (40,000 years ago), Europe (35,000 years ago), and the Americas (15,000 years ago).19 Globalization had an early start. The societal evolution from hunter/gatherers, to farmers/domestication, to industrial revolution, and now to technological/informational/service has been a dynamic event. More than 105 billion people have lived on the planet, with more than 6.5 billion occupying the planet at the present time. The annual growth rate is 1.14%, or more than 70 million. By 2020 the world population will reach 7.5 billion and by 2050, 9.3 billion. This comes about with a declining birth rate from 2.2% in 1963 to 1.3% in 1999. This growth is concentrated in Asia and Africa.20 We live in 268 nations, dependent areas, territories, and miscellaneous areas (191 in the United Nations). This population occupies 29% of the planet (total surface 510.072 million square kilometers), the rest being covered with water.21\n",

            "text": "It is clear that environmental changes have had a major impact on the planet, especially with the onset of the Industrial Age in the 19th century. Global warming is real. Greenhouse-gas emissions (GGEs) are composed of natural gases (eg, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) and human-made gases, especially carbon dioxide (eg, aerosols, fossil fuel combustion, and industrial processes).22 Over the past 20 years more than 75% of carbon dioxide emissions have come from burning fossil fuels. These GGEs are found in the earth atmosphere and allow sunlight free access to the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Some of this sunlight is reflected back to space as infrared radiation (heat). GGEs absorb and trap this sunlight. This upsets the balance of heat emitted by the sun and reflected back, thus causing a rise in global temperature. It is estimated that global temperature may rise in the range of 1.9\u00b0C to 11.5\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century.23 Recent information from Greenland reveals that the ice sheet discharge accelerated from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year over the past decade.24 Additionally, the displacement of ozone by these gases, which reflect the harmful ultraviolet sunlight, can have potential harmful effects on health, particularly with its effect on DNA.",

As early as 1989, Leaf25 warned of the consequences of global climate change. These included rising temperatures with subsequent heat stress, as witnessed recently in France. Ultraviolet light (200-400 nm) is divided into 3 categories: A, B, C. DNA and the aromatic amino acids absorb all 3: A>B>C. Skin cancers, cataracts, and depression of immune systems are directly related to these ultraviolet effects. Leaf25 further cites the 1989 World Commission on Environment and Development of the United Nations: When the century began, neither human numbers nor technology had the power radically to alter planetary systems. As the century closes, not only do vastly increased human numbers and their activities have that power, but major, unintended changes are occurring in the atmosphere, in soils, in waters, among plants and animals, and in the relationships among all of these. The rate of change is outstripping the ability of scientific disciplines and our capabilities to assess and advise. It is frustrating the attempts of political and economic institutions, which evolved in a different, more fragmented world, to adapt and cope.\n",

Indirect effects occur with vector-borne diseases, and crop production.

The warm, less salty water grows cool and more salty, sinking to form an exiting deep sea river, with the Great Conveyer Belt pushing the warmer water north again. With global warming the northern component is threatened, thereby decreasing the \u201cbelt\u201d and making it colder in the northern hemispheres, particularly in North America and Europe.27 The dire health effects now seen will be compounded by the global economic/political struggles that will emerge relating to the cost and competition for these diminishing fossil fuel resources.

The major climates include altitude, dry heat, cold, tropical, maritime (terrain with direct access to water), and temperate. The terrain or location is important as well. The majority of voluntary efforts are in areas hovering around the equator or in warmer climates, since these are the areas most affected by environmental fluctuations and changes. The equator is tragically the epicenter of the poverty belt. Working in a tropical climate demands attention to seasonal changes (eg, rainy seasons and hurricane seasons). Working in high altitude or cold climates must allow for acclimatization and avoidance of winter seasons. Maritime areas are of concern, especially insofar as water-borne diseases are concerned. Hot weather, dry or tropical, requires insight into the seasonal variations of native or local healthcare activity and the incidence of communicable diseases. Adjustment to terrain is extremely important, insofar as access to the site, or mobility within the site or the area served. Air, sea/river/lake, ground transportation of people, equipment, supplies are logistical considerations that must be addressed. Tragically, many injuries and deaths of volunteers occur during local travel accidents. Attention to climate, terrain, and access are, therefore, vital concerns.",

Yet it is the individual people who make it inhabitable and livable.

Some, such as Karl Marx, feel that this evolution is predetermined and does not regress to a previous stage.29 The stages include the tribal stage, which is a collective ownership stage, and the products of labor are collected and distributed in an equal manner. Many African countries were divided along arbitrary political and geographic lines, without consideration of the various tribes involved. Nigeria is a prime example of many tribes, where the primary allegiance is to the tribe and not the country. The colonial powers took advantage of this, in favoring certain powers to their own selfish purposes and agenda. Dire consequences have arisen, as witnessed in the genocide activity in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Sudan. The next stage is the feudal society or the monarchy stage, where everything, including land and production, is owned by the monarch. Theocratic societal systems fit in here, where the dominant religious group controls the society. The Italian Papal states and the more recent Muslim regimes, such as Iran, are notable examples. The capitalist stage is marked by private ownership\u2014individuals, government, or corporate. Socialism and communism are a blend of the stages, where both production and ownership are shared. So, in summary, the stages or systems are composed of the method of production\u2014slave, tribal, feudal, capitalist, and the ownership\u2014private or collective.29\n",

Taken as a single country, the United States has the largest economy (more than one third of the GWP), having grown to a gross domestic product (GDP) of $10,948.6 billion in 2005, compared with $7903 billion in 1998.30 The United States spends 14.9% of this GDP on domestic health care, having doubled since 197031, 32 (Fig 1). The 24% of the population living on less than $1 per day has not changed dramatically. Surprisingly U.S. health care is ranked 37th in the world, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) analysis.33 This report makes a convincing argument that, in addition to the delivery of high quality services, health systems must also protect its citizens from the financial burden of disease and illnesses, and meet their expectations in terms of dignified care.33 One would think it would rank first by any set of criteria used for analysis. The recent meeting of the G8 targeted foreign aid at 0.7% of GDP. This is a continuation of the Monterrey Consensus.34, 35, 36 Through 2003 $27 billion, or 0.1% of the target 0.7%, has been reached; $18 billion of this aid is for technical assistance. U.S. foreign aid is primarily administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (http://www.usaid.gov/). The Global Health Council (GHC) (www.globalhealth.org), the major global health lobby agency in Washington, DC, tracks U.S. global health policy and funding.",

Associated areas of education, nationality, language, religion, culture, and ethnicity are also related to demographic study. It is worth noting that the crude world population continues to rise, despite a decreased percentage of growth. Most all (99%) of the global population increase (the difference between numbers of births and number of deaths) occurs in the emerging economics of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The demographic transition model helps to explain the transition from high birth and death rates to low births and death rates.38 There are 3 stages. Stage \u0399 occurred before the Industrial Revolution when agriculture required more farm workers. More children were required to work the farms, and the death rate was higher in children. Here, birth and death rates remained stable, Stage \u0399\u0399 saw improvements in sanitation and health care in the mid-18th century. Death rates decreased, but stable birth rates saw increased populations. Emerging economics or less developed countries remain in this stage, thus forming the disproportionate global population growth. Stage \u0399\u0399\u0399 in the late 20th century saw stable birth and death rates in developed countries. This world population growth is placed in perspective25 (Fig 2).\n",

An epidemiological discussion that encompasses demographics has been outlined by Gaziano.51 The basic facts are that CVD accounted for 10% of all deaths at the dawn of the 20th century, and at the dusk of the 20th century economics accounts for 50% of deaths in developed countries and 25% of deaths in emerging economics. The pattern shows a dramatic increase in CVD in emerging countries as the 21st century progresses. Parallel economic, social, and demographic changes follow along with this transition concept. The economic changes include industrialization, globalization, and urbanization. Social changes are primarily diet and activity changes. Demographic transition, alluded to earlier, changes not only the balance of birth and death rates, but rising age rates, with subsequent emergence of more chronic diseases.",

The driving force for this diminution in size has been economics and technology, especially in the areas of communication and transportation. The 4th wave of transition from hunters/gathers to agrarian to industrial, and now technology, has transformed the world and its human population into this phenomenon of globalization. Globalization involves all aspects of SPEED. Its major effect has been in the social, political, and, especially, economic areas. It involves 2 basic processes. The first is movement and the second is integration. Movement, simply put, is shrinking the time element for the transfer of ideas, information, technology, skills, money, people, and product/goods.30 This has been achieved primarily by the computer/Internet and the advanced forms of physical transportation\u2014air, sea, and land. The second process or phenomenon is the integration of the elements of transfer into a global or universal structure. With the English language, with more than 1 million words, emerging as the universal language, and the ready Internet mechanisms for translation into any language, this integration will become increasingly streamlined, efficient, fluid, and rapid.",

Fostering this belief is a world economic outlook study that examined 42 countries representing 90% of the world population.58 Output per capita per country rose but distribution among countries became more uneven as the 20th century progressed. Perhaps a better tool to assess this objectively is the Human Development Index (HDI).

The federal government began increased financial support for medical research, mental health, the Veterans Administration, and community hospital construction (Hill-Burton Program). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) expanded from intramural efforts in Bethesda, Maryland, to extramural funding. Pharmaceutical funding also increased. Private insurance and managed care received another partner, the federal government, with the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. It has been managed care and the federal/state programs that have contributed to the slower acceleration of healthcare costs. In the United States today, the major healthcare concerns remain the slower but still increasing costs of health care, access to adequate care by uninsured working patients, quality assurance/outcomes, and to a lesser degree providing access and care to the poor income bracket of American society.30, 61\n",

The ongoing debate between the neo-Malthusians who believe the growing world population is unsustainable, and the Technocentrists who believe that emerging technologies can and will support a rising world population, continues to evoke a sustained emotional response. (Thomas Malthus [1766-1834]\u2014\u201cPolitical economist who warned of the potential of unchecked population growth to outstrip growth of the means of subsistence. The solution lay in \u2018moral restraint,\u2019 for instance by postponement of marriage, which would reduce the birth rate. These fears abated during the course of the19th century but arose again in the middle of the 20th century when rates of population growth in the poorer regions of the world started to accelerate. In testimony to his enduring influence the leaders of the international family planning movement that arose in response to this population growth were often characterized as neo-Malthusians.\u201d62) The Darwinian evolution theories as advanced by Herbert Spencer (originator of phrase \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d) espoused natural selection.20 The new school of social Darwinists have advanced the competitive survival of the fittest to include collaboration or an inclusiveness of all members of society.20 Such is the nature of most Americans (ie, the constant struggle to achieve balance between selfishness, self-reliance, rugged individualism, justice, and altruism, humanitarianism, compassion, forgiveness). All of these were outlined in profound depth by Ralph Waldo Emerson in his Essay on Self-Reliance63: \u201cDo that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.\u201d The roots of the Judeo-Christian ethic continue to run deep in American society.13 Our European colleagues also share this goal or desire for inclusiveness. Yet it requires that the medical profession retain or regain its \u201cmoral compass.\u201d This involves public trust. Once again, trust becomes a recurring theme. To retain or regain societal trust includes the ethic of professionalism. The British Royal College of Physicians has outlined the commitments to integrity, compassion, altruism, continuous improvement, excellence, and working within a cooperative team atmosphere.64 These values form a moral contract between the medical profession and society.",

            "text": "The noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, the developing force for the MDGs, has been a strong advocate for alleviating extreme poverty. Using clinical economies, he advocates continued initiatives to address the root causes of poverty (ie, polluted water, poor soil, and lack of basic health care).7 He maintains the key to escaping poverty is increased assistance to allow basic infrastructure and human capital to be put in place. He emphasizes the use of simple technology in many initiatives (eg, mosquito nets for malaria prevention).66 Yet once poverty is at least controlled or alleviated, staying out of poverty becomes the major issue. This involves finding a job or source of income. Globalization has helped in this area, particularly with global corporate initiatives to outsource for cheaper labor. However, this may only aggravate the Ricardo theory of the \u201ciron law of wages.\u201d (David Ricardo (1772-1823)\u2014Economist Iron Law of Wages, 1817 [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/ricardo.htm] www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/ricardo-wages.html.) This means wages can be kept at a basic minimum, since workers are infinitely available, replaceable, and interchangeable. Witness the odyssey of the tennis shoe industry from country to country as the unskilled labor force changes. Again, the theory of Malthus comes to haunt us, in that he theorizes that human misery is inescapable because populations reproduce themselves exponentially.",

Clearly the Ghana model is not practical or cost-effective. Current thinking is evolving to a more collaborative and interactive approach.71 The development of the horizontal approach and streaming concept is a more disease-specific approach.72 This allows both sides of the healthcare team to prioritize their efforts and share the advantages of individualized care, triage, and population/cohort dynamics. The curative practitioner looking at the horizontal model now places his individual patient in perspective, where all aspects are considered. The public health or preventive medicine practitioner also sees how the population or cohort fits into the streaming process so all components of the healthcare system are used in a coordinated, caring, and cost-effective manner. Even in the United States, the traditional departmental systems of medical schools and medical centers are evolving into a more efficient problem-, disease-, or systems-based education, training, clinical practice, and research/development mode73 (Fig 6). Working together this fluid approach engages and prioritizes the resources available to act in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Thus the pyramidal system as traditionally practiced is becoming obsolete, particularly in emerging economies.72\n",

There are many categories83 (Table 10). In some countries, such as Haiti, foreign NGOs account for more than 70% of the total healthcare delivery. Emerging economies are slowly developing NGO efforts. India and China are notable examples (www.indianngos.com/; www.fupin.org.cn/hhh/hhh.htm). As the economies grow more efforts will be seen that complement the generosity of the developed nations. In total, in 1995 the nonprofit sector in 22 of the developed countries generated and spent more than $1.1 trillion per year, far exceeding the multilateral and bilateral efforts.82 In recent years, more attention from the multilateral, bilateral, NGO, and individual elements is being focused on the efficacy of the myriad of global humanitarian healthcare initiatives. The quantity of money spent is being challenged by accountability or getting the best value for the diminishing financial and human resources. Many governmental grants are now being administered by large NGOs. The direct government or UN aid directly to countries is being carefully scrutinized and monitored. At the frontline level, many smaller NGOs are facing increased challenge and frustration acquiring financial support or free donated product.

It is in this area that the United States has earned an international reputation for volunteer humanitarian healthcare initiatives. The Presbyterian hospitals and Maryknoll mission clinics in South Korea are typical examples of that effort. Americans have continued this effort, particularly in the area of non-faith-based initiatives. Although rooted in the ethical aspects of religion, humanism is at the central core of volunteerism, and works in concert with faith-based groups. This is in stark contrast to the Machiavelli approach92: \u2026 for a man who strives after goodness in all his acts is sure to come to win, since there are so many men who are not good.

For many years religious- and non-religious-based medical missionaries have traveled to developing countries to deliver basic medical care.

Additionally, the corporate world has been involved. In many countries with foreign-based operations, clinics and hospitals were established to care for native workers (eg, Firestone Tire Corporation Hospital in Liberia to care for rubber plantation workers). The military, especially in the United States, has a long tradition of providing immediate, short-term care to noncombatants in foreign countries both in times of war and in times of peace, especially natural disasters.

Upscale programs are where surgeons go to advance themselves (eg, surgeons coming to the United States for observational visits, or a cardiac surgeon visiting Leipzig, Germany, to witness advanced robotic cardiac surgical procedures). A lateral program is usually an academic affiliation with a foreign program that involves clinical, educational, and research efforts. The upgrade program is a place that is in need of economic relief, for example, equipment and supplies, or for demonstration of new or advanced procedures and specialized care. The rejuvenate program is where surgery has ceased for political, economic, and social reasons and wants to get reestablished. The de novo program is starting or introducing a center that is new and needs a total effort. These last 3 programs are the usual areas for voluntary humanitarian activity. It must be stressed that most missions are short term (<2 weeks) and deal with mostly elective cases. Emergency or urgent cases are not often seen, unless it is a mass-casualty, disaster-type mission. The volunteer opportunities usually are with NGOs.

The developing world is desperately short of radiologists and functioning imaging equipment.108 Added to this is a lack of infrastructure for repair/replacement, or preventive biomedical maintenance. Biomedical engineers are a rare commodity, and therefore there is a total reliance on lucrative foreign corporate contracts for repair and maintenance. Basic local training in low-cost, portable ultrasonic equipment would be a tremendous advance in diagnostic capability (the Acuson Cyprus ECHO machine is a prime example of diagnosing congenital heart defects at the local, ambulatory level). The etiological, anatomic/regional, pathophysiological/subsystem approach to differential diagnosis and categorization may be useful (Table 14).

Disease-specific missions, especially for surgical specialties, is of great value (eg, plastic surgery/ears/nose/throat groups performing cleft lip surgery, ophthalmology with cataract surgery, orthopedics with basic congenital deformities and osteomyelitis, gynecology with vaginal fistulas, and urology with urethral strictures). Most of the emergency and urgent surgery in developing countries and emerging economies is performed at the first referral level (I) or district/rural health (II) facilities. For women, the leading causes of maternal death (>500,000/yr) are related to bleeding, infection, unsafe abortion, eclampsia, or obstructed labor.

As an example, China, the 3rd largest country in the world, with a culture dating back over 7000 years and the largest population at more than 1.3 billion, does not have a national based graduate medical education program or system. Excluding 10% to 20% of 5-year medical school graduates after high school who do not pursue a medical career, the majority of students seek employment at predominantly government hospitals, controlled and managed by local medical schools or health bureaus. Each hospital designs and runs its own residency program in a pyramidal system that harkens back to the older European system. Recently, many of the larger urban medical centers have established organized residency programs. A model standardized 6-year cardiothoracic residency program has been initiated recently at Shanghai Chest Hospital under the auspices of the World Heart Foundation. Patterned after the U.S. system, it has been modified for China. The major challenge has been restructuring the faculty to accept a horizontal, time-limited training system with graduated degrees of resident responsibility and accountability. This is a challenging area and a viable opportunity for volunteer faculty, especially semiretired and retired surgeons (www.world-heart.org).",

            "text": "Preparation for working in an international area is sometimes difficult, complex, and challenging. Most current American trained surgeons, as mentioned, are not adequately prepared for international surgery. Several initiatives have been advanced to alleviate this program. Historically, Seymour Schwartz, MD, from Rochester, New York, published a text on tropical surgery, which demonstrated operative techniques for problems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Recently, Kamel and Lumley120 published a comprehensive text on tropical surgery. Several surgical training programs have developed a rural surgery curriculum that better serves the needs of the rural or somewhat isolated areas. This is good preparation for foreign activities as well. Already, more surgical training programs in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand are offering rural/international surgery training, as well as sponsoring and developing collaboration with emerging countries. The 2-fold goal is to allow residents an opportunity both to learn and to serve. They learn surgical techniques that are appropriate abroad as well as provide service in needed areas. Ozgediz and colleagues121 have beautifully described a program developed between the surgery departments of the University of California at San Francisco and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. A pilot, voluntary 6-week clinical rotation is in evolution there. The major hurdles or obstacles in developing such a relationship are: a clear and concise memorandum and business plan; issues relating to visa, licensure, credentialing, housing, lodging; mentoring and supervision of resident cases; use of vacation time versus allowed elective time for credit; credentialing and academic appointments of the host country; recognition of credit for resident cases performed in the host country; financial support of residents by the donor program; and loss of resident workers from the donor program. Several recent on-site experiences illustrate the benefits derived for both the donor and host. Karamichalis and Moller98 describe an experience of donor staff and residents providing clinical care and education in Mexico. This exemplifies the concept of coordinated missions where all participants learn from the experience. The future will see more U.S.-based residents seeking experience, exposure, volunteerism, and training in foreign programs that not only have available pathology but local staff with varying degrees of experience.",

In the operating room the volunteer surgeon either observes, 2nd assists, 1st assists, or performs the operation. That is an important area to reflect on, because it changes within a given project or varies from project to project. Also for the surgeon, education/training is accomplished at varying levels: mentor, coach, manager, or instructor level. The instructor level is very objective, short-term, and achievable (ie, teaching a specific technique or procedure). At the manager level, a systems process is introduced where team and structure are introduced. At the coaching level the integration of team and structure is brought into a systems analysis. The mentor level is the personalized, subjective aspect of teaching/advising. It is the level where both individuals and systems are looked at from a social/philosophical perspective that gives insight/suggestions on a long-term basis, grounded in trust, respect, admiration, congeniality, and concern. It is here that the human factor plays its greatest role. Loop,148 in a classic treatise on mentoring, exploits the notion of the surgeon\u2019s professional life as involving education, achievement, and payback. Payback is the area where mentoring has its greatest effect.

Certainly not the major focus, R/D is an important element as emerging countries grow and develop. From the voluntary humanitarian perspective, ethical principles become a major concern. At the onset, ethical principles regarding clinical and education/training initiatives carry over into R/D. C. Rollins Hanlon, MD,149 has nicely summarized the 6 major principles that should govern health care (Table 23). The ACS has carried these major principles over to the development of a \u201cCode of Professional Conduct.\u201d150 Both these elements also apply to global humanitarian efforts. There are 2 areas that volunteers must be aware of. The first involves dealings with corporate or business individuals, especially in foreign countries where local practice is at variance with the U.S. standards. Recent codes in this area have been developed by Adva Med for the United States and should be applied internationally.151 The second area is in research involving clinical subjects. Suffice it to say, clinical studies involving human subjects outside the United States should abide by all the ethical standards established by the international community.152, 153 The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has developed guidelines for developing countries.153 Additionally, on-site training of clinical researchers is tremendously valuable and is sorely needed. As an example, although India has more than 250,000 practicing physicians for more than 1 billion people, less than 200 investigators have been trained to carry out efficient, safe, and effective clinical research.154 Proceeding in a phased way is a common sense approach. Case reports, limited then expanded retrospective studies, technical reports, and prospective studies using accepted statistical methods, and abiding by investigational review board standards and approval is the usual approach or sequence for young academic or investigational physicians. This includes ethics review, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, and informed consent. The revised Declaration of Helsinki in 2000 has defined this on the international level.155 This revision declares that any treatment being tested in clinical trials should be compared with the best universal standard and not a placebo.",

The military medical mission is to preserve the fighting force by assuring and maintaining the individual soldier, seaman, or airman to be fit to fight and deployable worldwide. The military is the most suitable and qualified to handle emergency and disaster situations. In addition to its combat mission is the peacetime mission to provide care and services to active duty personnel, active duty dependents, retirees, and retired dependents. Whether in wartime, peacetime, or manmade or natural emergencies/disasters, the military health team has provided assistance when directed. The humanitarian aspect of the military healthcare mission is well recognized, but not widely known in the civilian sector. Inspired by such individuals as Dominique Jean Larrey, Napoleon\u2019s surgeon, humanity on the battlefield has been extended to treat all battlefield wounded with excellent care, regardless of their status (ie, military or civilian). There are countless examples of medical humanitarian efforts associated with both wartime and peacetime missions.176\n",

The lethality of war wounds has decreased progressively from 42% in the Revolutionary War, 33% in the Civil War, 30% in World War II, 24% in Vietnam, and now 10% in Iraq/Afghanistan. More than 66% of injuries in Iraq are secondary to improvised explosive devices, shrapnel, or explosions and 16% are secondary to gunshot wounds. Protective body armor, advanced care at the site of injury, rapid evacuation, and advances in multiple trauma care have contributed to the decreased lethality of injury. Lessons learned in the military have permeated civilian practice and certainly volunteer efforts. The specialized units of World War II, the aggressive approach to vascular wounds in Korea, and the understanding of adult respiratory syndrome (Da Nang Lung) in Vietnam are but a few of the military surgical contributions. The forward surgical team (FST) concept in Iraq has already shown its effectiveness.97 The FST is composed of 10 officers and 10 enlisted personnel: 3 trauma surgeons, 1 orthopedic surgeon, 2 nurse anesthetists (certified registered nurse anesthetists), 3 clinical nurses, and 1 operations officer. The team is designed to perform 30 operations over 72 hours. This exhausts their equipment/supply capability. The design and concept has practical application in clinical scenarios.",

These are part of the newly recognized complex emergency situations.186 These are acute situations that occur in natural or manmade events or disasters and affect large populations over large or small geographical areas. In addition to the acute event, the sequelae of communicable diseases, climatic changes, migration, refuges, and food shortages compound the situation over varying periods of time. The tsunami catastrophe in Southeast Asia and the Pakistani earthquake are present examples of complex emergencies. It should be stressed that it is the combination of communicable diseases, along with malnutrition, that account for the majority of deaths in these complex emergencies. Again the preventive measures take precedence. These include site planning, clean, potable water, sanitation, nutrition, immunization, vector control, personal protection (shelter, nets), personal hygiene, health education, and disease treatment.187\n",

Other states have adopted charitable foundations, including volunteer initiatives (eg, the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance [http://www.massmed.org/]).
