Both organisations provide patients with expert and evidence-based information that relates to their oral, orthodontic and overall health. The campaign was launched after the recent statement released by the General Dental Council recommending that for all dental interventions patients should have a face-to-face consultation with a trained clinician at the beginning of treatment. This is of paramount importance as patients need to make informed decisions about their treatment, and the only way to do so, is for the patients to see a trained clinician in person to discuss the treatment (and indeed alternatives) in detail (including risks and complications) so that they are fully informed of what to expect from the outset.",

He continued: 'For me, one of the issues with \"DIY Braces\" is that it offers just one narrow solution when there may be a more appropriate one for the patient. The value of informed choice cannot be over-estimated. ' This is a huge step that should, hopefully, raise awareness of the dangers of direct to consumer orthodontics to the general public.",

            "text": "Sir, I enjoyed the paper entitled Experience of listening to music on patient anxiety during minor oral surgery procedures: a pilot study by Gupta and Ahmed 1 and feel that music can be an invaluable tool in calming patients during procedures. Using music as medicine is a safe and non-pharmacological method \uf03c \uf037 of managing anxiety during complex dental procedures and the potential for research in this area is wide. Regarding the study, I pose a question to the authors: I was interested to read that almost half of the participants (48%) reported that music made communication easier and wonder if they could elaborate on this? In my experience, when patients wear headphones and listen to music for distraction and relaxation, communication is negatively affected to some degree in terms of gaining the patient's attention and I wondered how the authors overcame this challenge. Additionally, it is no secret that dentistry can be a stressful career, now more than ever due to the coronavirus. Stress is believed to be one of the major factors that negatively affect our health, contributing to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pain and burn out to name but a few. 2 The calming and stress reducing effects of listening to music have been widely studied and this simple and cost-effective method of relaxation is something easily accessible to all members of the dental team. Well-being is always an important consideration and fundamental to happiness and good mental health. There are so many benefits linked to the simple pleasure of listening to our favourite music and I would encourage my colleagues and peers to think about capitalising on these benefits. Our study only investigated the effect on the patient of music via headphones, not on the dentist. We would agree that dentistry is a stressful profession, but stress is generally hard to measure and includes so many variables outside clinical factors. At our teaching and training centre in Birmingham, we do not play music as this can lead to distraction for our students, trainees and staff. Moreover, playing music in a hospital or clinic does require a licence. As our project suggests patients are welcome to bring their own music using their smart phone and play various tracks using their own headphones.",

Whilst this is possible for a Tier 3 Oral Surgery service, these patients usually also present with multiple restorable carious teeth which ideally should be restored prior to listing them for the GA, which we unfortunately are not commissioned to provide under this service. The treatment plan usually ends up advising that their GDP refer them for restorations under IV sedation in a Community Dental Practice (Tier 1) service and be made dentally fit before they get re-referred back to us, solely for the extractions. If this is not possible, the only other option is every single carious tooth will have to be extracted in the same course of treatment under GA, which usually adds up to a significant number for a relatively young adult. This problem is compounded by the common presentation that these patients are usually dental needle phobic, who almost certainly will not tolerate needle plus drilling under single drug IV sedation alone. In some areas they may be able to be referred to a Special Care service, but these are very limited, and the patients may not fulfil the referral criteria. The behavioural decision as to whether these patients 'will not tolerate needle' or 'cannot tolerate needle' becomes so fine that it may be up to the discretion of the clinician on the day.

While most consumers are unaware of the potential harm to their teeth of these items, the same approaches employed to reduce unhealthy food intakes (eg sugar, fat, etc), could also help to reduce TSL. 2,3 Front of pack food labelling (FOPL) has long been used to help consumers to make informed purchases, although policies are not consistent between different regions and countries. FOPL commonly include types and/or relative amounts of fats, starch, salt, protein and fibre. 4 It is important for manufacturers to also include acidity of foods and drinks in the labelling.
