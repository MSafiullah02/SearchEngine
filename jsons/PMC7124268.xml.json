The mechanisms leading to the presence of sHLA-I and sHLA-II in serum are not completely understood. It is possible that they are both shed from the membrane of damaged or lysed cells and secreted from activated immune cells. In fact, the serum levels of sHLA-I and sHLA-II increase during acute rejection episodes following organ transplant 3, 4, 5, 6and acute graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation 6, 7, as well as during phenomena involving immune activation, like infectious 6, 8and autoimmune diseases [9]. Furthermore, it has been reported that sHLA-I and sHLA-II may play an immunomodulatory role, mainly by downregulating activated immune cells [10].",

            "text": "Autoimmunity certainly plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Supports to this assessment come from genetic, histologic, and immunologic observations. In particular, there are evidences that the DR2 haplotype DRB1\u22171501-DQA1\u22170102-DQB1\u22170602, is commonly associated to MS in Caucasian subjects [11]. Moreover, both perivascular cuffing around CNS venules and infiltrating T lymphocytes, plasmacells, and mononuclear cells are found in acute MS lesions [12]. Finally, T lymphocytes and autoantibodies reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) and other myelin proteins such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), proteolipid protein (PLP), or myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) can be isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, although autoreactive MBP-specific T cells and autoantibodies to MBP are also detected in the blood and CSF of normal donors [24]. Thus, autoantigen presentation by specific HLA molecules to autoreactive T lymphocytes appears as a key factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, abnormalities in serum concentrations of sHLA-I and sHLA-II are expected in MS patients. Moreover, because the detectability of sHLA-I molecules in the CSF has been demonstrated [25], it could be of interest to investigate the presence and the biologic behavior of sHLA-I and sHLA-II molecules in the CSF of MS patients. However, to the best of our present knowledge, no information exists on the level of sHLA-I and sHLA-II in serum and CSF of MS patients. The aim of this study was to quantitate the concentrations of sHLA-I and sHLA-II molecules in the sera and CSF of MS patients and to compare their levels with those observed in normal control subjects and in patients affected by other neurologic diseases (OND).",

Recently, cross-reactivity of MBP specific CD4+ T-cell clones with structural antigens of human Coronavirus 229E have been described [31], thus supporting the hypothesis that exogenous factors (i.e., viral antigens) in genetically predisposed individuals might induce autoimmunity by antigen-mimicking. In particular, autoantigen presentation and HLA restriction phenomena could be primarily involved in predisposing a genetic background to MS development. The elevated rate of concordance of MS manifestation in monozygotic twins (25%) [32]and the frequent association between MS and the DR2 haplotype DRB1\u22171501-DQA1\u22170102-DQB1\u22170602 [11]furtherly underline the pathogenetic role of the HLA haplotype in MS.

In this view, the increased sHLA-I serum levels might be merely the consequence of the inflammatory status and might be due to either shedding from dead cells or secretion from activated cells. However, the decrease of serum sHLA-II levels is difficult to be simply interpreted as a secondary manifestation because a concordant increase of both sHLA-I and sHLA-II concentrations was detected in the serum of all infectious or inflammatory diseases studied until now [6].",

The existence in MS patients of a significant correlation between serum and CSF sHLA-I concentrations and the fact that the HI-I was below the HI-I upper normal limit support the hypothesis that in these patients sHLA-I concentrations found in the CSF come from blood through the BBB. Interestingly, significantly lower sHLA-I concentrations were detected in the CSF of MS patients with a relapse than in those with stable disease, thus indicating that intra-CNS variations of sHLA-I concentrations can be associated with different clinical phases of the disease.",

Thus, the presence of sHLA-II in the CSF of MS patients appears as a disease-related phenomenon. The fact that the highest sHLA-II concentrations were found in the CSF of MS patients with relapse perhaps relates the release of these molecules with phenomena (and phases) of local immune activation. Unfortunately, the limited volume of CSF available from each patient does not allow the purification of sufficient amounts of sHLA-II to test their effect on activated T lymphocytes. Because in MS patients no correlation was found between CSF and serum sHLA-II levels, it is likely that CSF sHLA-II molecules are produced within the CNS. They could be shed from HLA class II positive cells (microglia cells) dying in the CNS or they could be secreted by activated immune cells. It must be considered that simple clinical observation does not give us reliable information on the activity of the disease and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast enhancement with gadolinium often shows an active disorder with disruption of the BBB also during the apparently stable clinical phase of the disease. In fact, serial MRI with gadolinium is almost tenfold more sensitive than clinical examination to detect an ongoing disease activity [36]and therefore future efforts should be directed to correlate the amount of serum and CSF sHLA-I and sHLA-II, together with that of other soluble mediators of inflammation, to the MRI signs of disease activity. At the moment, therefore, it is not possible to affirm whether the absence of significant amounts of sHLA-II in CSF of about half of MS patients studied is related to different phases of the disease or is the expression of different forms of MS.",
