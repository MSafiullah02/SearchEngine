In addition, the stressor is associated with difficulty in falling asleep, restless sleep, early morning awakening, lack of energy, dizziness, generalized anxiety, irritability, sadness, demoralization; significant impairment in social or occupational functioning; and feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life [9].",

Exemplifications of such a distress are: (1) 16 of the 100 nurses at the Pohang Medical Center in North Gyeongsang Province resigned due to overwork among the COVID-19 epidemic [26]; (2) >3,000 medical health workers in (Wuhan) Hubei Province were infected with COVID-19 at a very early stage (before and in January of 2020).

Lowering job demands and workload [31], while increasing job control and reward might help to protect medical health workers. Individual interventions adequate for medical staff in the current situation, where they wear medical protective equipment which cannot be removed during work time, are still unknown. Story sharing [32] would be important as well as reinforcing the positive assets of persons [33]. Simple, easy, practical methods are needed. Electronic devices, such as mobile phones and computers, may help.",

First, a cross-sectional design was applied although a longitudinal approach might help verifying whether allostatic overload develops (exhaustion may ensue after some time) and whether psychiatric disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, might occur with the COVID-19 progression. Second, psychological assessment was based on an online survey and on self-report tools. The use of clinical interviews is encouraged in future studies to draw a more comprehensive assessment of the problem. Third, it is not possible to assess the participation rate since it is unclear how many subjects received the link for the survey.",
