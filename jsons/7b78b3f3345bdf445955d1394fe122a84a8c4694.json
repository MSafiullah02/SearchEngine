            "text": "Before I decided to write an Editorial in an Orthopaedic Journal about a non-orthopaedic disease I thought about the Pro's and Con's. I am not an expert in epidemiology or virology, but as the pandemic is heavily affecting all parts of life in every place in the world, I finally decided to write about the changes that occurred in my professional but also in my personal life due to the disease. This Editorial is not written in the standard, scientific fashion with multiple references, but tries to document the huge impact the pandemic has on day to day living. I am sure that regardless of where you live most of you experienced something similar, under more or less dramatic circumstances. I hope it finds you all in good health and after a while we can go back to our working routine as Orthopaedic Surgeons. However, I am sure that as long as no vaccine and/or treatment has been found, tested, and produced in a sufficient number, we will have a high chance of second and third waves. Therefore, there will be a lot of restrictions and changes affecting our routine all throughout this and probably next year, too. However, finally when we will have overcome the pandemic we will look back and hopefully take the right measures as societies for future events.",

My Hospital is normally solely an Orthopaedic Hospital specialising in elective surgeries (arthroplasty, spine, sports med.,\u2026). It is located in Bavaria, the state in Germany with the highest number of Covid-19 patients of all German states. The situation in Germany differs at that time from the situation in other EU countries, like Italy, Spain or France. Although Germany has the third highest number of Covid-19 positive patients in the EU, we still have a relatively low number of deaths (around 1.5 %) compared to the other countries (8-10%). This is more or less demonstrating that a lot of tests have been performed compared to the other countries and that in the beginning more young people were affected. The percentage might change within the next weeks as now also a lot of older patients in nursing homes are tested positive. The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU is still increasing every day, however, we still have enough ICU capacity left and scenarios like in other countries have not happened in Germany so far. However, it is still far too early for giving an all-clear. Therefore, most of us still watch the daily numbers of new infections, doubling time, and patients in ICU and hope that the curve is flattening further.",

Emergency control, for example, appointed a medical leader in every county in order to coordinate patient flow, beds, protective material and ventilators. All free beds, and in particular all free ICU beds need to be reported online, every day, at a predefined time. Based on those numbers the patient flow is optimized and the collaboration between counties and states organised. This also allows to move patients from one Hospital group to another, something that would be impossible outside of a crisis. However, only with all these regulations, areas with higher patient numbers can be relieved and units in lesser affected areas of the country can actually support the system.",

This is nothing to get depressed about, it is just a fact. As an Orthopaedic surgeon we can deliver very substantial pain reduction and gain of function, our duty is to improve quality of life not to save lives. So now, in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis, our role as a surgeon has been cut back to a minimum, only trauma cases, infections and acute pain exacerbation that doesn't respond to pain medication are left for us to treat. In my Hospital that is less than 15% of my cases.",
