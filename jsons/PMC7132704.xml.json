It is consistent with previous studies who revealed poor student nurses' knowledge regarding infection control practices.17, 21 Several factors contributed to the nurses' lack of knowledge in some topics; one of these was dissatisfaction with the content of the infection control educational courses during their studies.23 Other factors included a shortage of well-designed infection control programs that targeted health care workers during their clinical practices.24\n",

These findings confirmed that nurses in Jordan were not strictly complying with activities that protect them from the transmission of infectious diseases. Our finding is consistent with the Al-Rawajfah et al17 study that revealed nurses in Jordan have low compliance to infection control practices. The researchers revealed that the lack of resources is a major barrier for compliance with infection prevention guidelines among Jordanian nurses. Other barriers from the literature that could not be measured in our study include heavy workload11 and lack of safety climate.25 Also, the Nmadu et al study26 reported that lack of supplies and organizational structure were significant barriers to nurses' compliance with isolation precautions.",

However, there was no significant difference in compliance between them. The results of this study support findings from a previous study by Aloush,11 who reported no significant improvement in nurses' compliance with infection control guidelines after an educational program. Aloush found that nurse to patient ratio and lower unit capacity are significant predictors of nurses' compliance, and concluded that education would not improve nurses' compliance unless their workload was lowered. Barikani and Afaghi10 also stated that having good knowledge and a positive attitude are not enough to influence nurses' compliance to isolation precautions; providing appropriate supplies and a manageable workload were highly recommended in the study.",

This study was conducted mainly in governmental hospitals that are characterized by high workload and high demand on equipment and supplies. Therefore, it is expected that shortages in these supplies are a major barrier for nurses in trying to follow isolation precautions. This finding highlights the urgent need for the Ministry of Health to support those hospitals with isolation supplies to protect both patients and health care workers. In addition, this finding highlights a significant defect in the policies that are supposed to organize and facilitate nurses' isolation practices, and supports the reports of previous studies that denoted the impact of policies on nurses' compliance. Giard et al27 reported that organizational structure had a positive effect on nurses' isolation practice, and McCoy et al28 highlighted institutional healthy climate as a significant predictor for compliance among nurses.",

However, one limitation of the study is that because there is no well-established tool to measure knowledge and practice in relation to isolation precaution, our developed questionnaire needs to be further tested and developed. Another limitation that we have failed to measure other factors that could influence nurses' compliance with isolation precautions. Finally, this study included only Jordanian nurses, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to other settings and other populations.

The Jordanian Ministry of Health and other private and university hospitals should implement more health education programs on infection control and isolation as a part of its disaster plan in case of an infectious disease outbreak. Furthermore, they should consider other strategies, such as implementing more supervision and monitoring of infection control practices, adapting the guidelines into nurses' routine practices, and providing more isolation structures, supplies, and reminders about isolation precautions.",
