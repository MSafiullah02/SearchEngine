In patients who meet the criteria for transplant listing, the current allocation system is designed to direct the next available donor liver to the sickest patient on the list to reduce wait-list mortality. Liver allocationwas originally based on overall wait times, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, and ABO blood type compatibility [1]. However, this allocation scheme had limitations in that longer waiting times on the transplant list did not correspond with increased patient mortality and the CTP scoredid not adequately represent the general transplant population [1]. The CTP score is based on three laboratory values (prothrombin time, bilirubin, albumin) and two subjective clinical variables (ascites and encephalopathy). Despite the CTP scoring model initially being utilized as part of an organ allocation system, it has never been validated for estimating survival in patients with chronic liver disease [1]. The CTP score is rather reflective of complications of portal hypertension, and its lack of objectivity limited its application to transplant organ allocation [2].",

The MELD scorehas subsequently been validated as a severity of liver disease scoring system and predictive mortalitytool independent of etiology or occurrence of portal hypertensive complications [1, 2]. Baseline MELD scores have been shown to be significantly associated with wait-list mortality [4]. Since its approval in 2002, the MELD score helps determine liver allocation for patients awaiting transplantation by providing 3-month predictive mortality [5] and has become the most commonly utilized liver organ allocation tool worldwide. Sicker patients are represented by a higher MELD score and therefore are assigned a higher priority on transplant waiting lists. The main advantage of the MELD score is that it is objective in that it is based on three laboratory values (serum INR, bilirubin, and creatinine). It is not a perfect system in that it doesn\u2019t always reflect the urgency in patients with relatively low physiologic MELD score but who have clear indications for liver transplantation (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatopulmonary syndrome, metabolic disorders) [6]. These patients are usually granted MELD exception points that would help them to be competitive for transplants depending on their region of residence. More recently, the MELD-Na has been introduced to provide a more accurate assessment of wait-list mortality and to take into account the complications of portal hypertension [7].",

This raises new challenges and questions in today\u2019s practice. This chapter aims to outline current evidence for transplantation of patients with high MELD scores, discuss transplant futility, address simultaneous multi-organ transplantation, discuss surgical techniques for complications of cirrhosis at the time of transplantation, discuss postoperative management, and outline the role of living-related transplantation in today\u2019s environment.",

Wait-list mortalityis directly proportional to the MELD score, where a MELD score of <9 is associated with an approximate mortality of 2% and a MELD score \u2265 40 is associated with a wait-list mortality of 71% [1]. In general, for the patients with MELD scores \u226415, the risks of LT likely outweigh the benefit. In low MELD patients, the risk of mortality from LT is greater than remaining on the transplant wait-list [8]. These patients are therefore allocated to the bottom of the list and, depending on the program, often not listed until their MELD score increases. Application of the MELD score has reduced the number of patients awaiting LT and lowered peri-transplant mortality [6]. The MELD score has not been able to improve the shortage of available organs. Organ distribution is based on medical urgency, rather than expected posttransplant outcomes. Patients with MELD scores >35 are typically admitted to the ICU, potentially on dialysis, receive hemodynamic or respiratory support [9], and are potential candidates for urgent LT. In such situations, it may seem that sick patients would not benefit from operative intervention. However, based on a 5-year time frame, the higher the MELD score, the greater the benefit of LT [10]. Survival benefit posttransplantation is seen in MELD scores >40 because this population has the greatest risk of mortality while awaiting LT [11].",

It was believed that organ allocation to this higher risk population was futile and not beneficial for individual patient outcomes or for appropriate resource utilization. Currently, the pretransplant MELD score has not been able to reliably predict posttransplant outcomes [12, 13]. As patients linger on waiting lists, MELD scores continue to increase. It is common to see patients with MELD scores >40 awaiting LT. Low-MELD-score patients may also spend a prolonged amount of time on wait-lists, deteriorate, and become part of the sickest quartile of individuals awaiting LT. Interest lies in assessing which critically ill patients with high MELD scores derive the most benefit from LT. In patients with MELD scores >40, are there additional factors not captured by the MELD score that can predict successful or futile transplantation outcomes? In order to reduce wait times, in 2013, the United Sates adopted the Share 35 policy, which mandated that there would be an increase in regional sharing of organs to patients with MELD scores \u226535 [14].",

The 90-day and 3-year survival were 84 and 62.5%, respectively, despite the fact that 88% of patients received vasopressors, 56% received renal replacement therapy, and 87% were mechanically ventilated prior to transplantation [15]. The same study found that patients >60 years of age had a significantly higher 90-day mortality (27% vs 13%) [15]. A multivariate analysis of 8070 transplant patients aged \u226560 identified that recipient albumin levels <2.5 mg/dL, serum creatine \u22651.6 mg/dL, hospitalization at the time of organ offer, ventilator dependence, presence of diabetes, and recent hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity were independent predictors of poor patient survival [16]. In this study, the strongest prognostic factor was a recipient and donor age combination equal to or greater than 120 years [16]. Asrani et al. [17] retrospectively reviewed non-HCV cirrhotic LT recipients and identified that patients who had a survival of <50% at 5 years were above 60 years old with median MELD scores of 40. These patients also had multiple medical comorbidities and were on life support at the time of LT. Age > 60 in patients with elevated MELD scores has consistently been shown to be associated with worse posttransplantation survival compared to those patients with MELD scores >40 and age < 60.",

[21] retrospectively reviewed a nationwide transplant database and found that the overall mortality was statistically higher in patients with MELD scores \u226540, compared to patients with a MELD score < 30 (30 versus 26%). Despite the significant difference in mortality, the MELD >40 group had a lower mortality rate than initially predicted, which was thought to be secondary to younger age of recipients, lower prevalence of diabetes, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), HCV, Epstein-Barr virus, TIPS, or prior upper abdominal surgery [21]. This group utilized greater hospital resources (longer pretransplant hospitalization, ICU admission, required mechanical ventilation, and longer hospital length of stay) [21]. Within the same study, MELD patients with a score of >40 and recipient age > 60, BMI > 30, pretransplant hospitalization, or use of extended criteria donors predicted LT futility. The risk of mortality increased by 95%, and graft failure was 60% higher when compared to patients with a MELD <30. Despite the significantly increased risk, there is a perceived benefit to transplanting such sick patients because they have expected survival of >50% at 5 years (64% graft and 69% patient survival) [21]. In recipients with satisfactory graft function, MELD scores >30 are significantly associated with prolonged ICU stay (defined as \u22653 days) which is associated with poor patient and graft survival at 3, 12, and 60 months [22]. However, good LT outcomes can be seen in patients with MELD scores \u226540, where overall 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival of 89, 79, 75, and 69% can be seen when futile deaths are excluded [20]. There is a definite subgroup of patients in this high-risk category in whom LT becomes futile despite optimal management. Michard et al. performed a single-center retrospective review and identified that in patients awaiting LT with MELD scores >40, those admitted to the ICU had elevated lactate (>5 mmol/L) or developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and had a poor 3-year survival rate of 29% [23]. In this subpopulation, LT is clearly not beneficial. A comparison of several studies with high MELD scores and associated variables predicting poor patient survival is summarized in Table 14.1.",

Furthermore, the quality of the donor organ has not impacted recipient survival in recipients with MELD scores >30 [28]. The complexity of organ allocation systems in individual countries can further complicate organ allocation. In 2013, the Share 35 policy was implemented in order to enhance distribution of organs in the United States for patients with MELD scores \u226535 [29]. Since its implementation, there has been a 36% reduction of organoffers accepted for patients with MELD scores \u226535, while there was no change in organ acceptance for MELD scores <35 [29]. The most common reasons for declining an organ offer were \u201cpatient transplanted, transplant in progress, or other offer being considered,\u201d indicating that programs had several offers to choose from and were selectively choosing donors that were deemed to be more optimal [29].",

In imminent futility, a performed action may have prolonged an individual\u2019s life, however, only for the very short term. For example, a patient with ESLD undergoes LT, and a few days or weeks later pass without being discharged from hospital. The intent of the transplant was to extend the patient\u2019s life by years, and the result was below this expectation. In this situation there is a subjective perceived benefit; the patient\u2019s life was prolonged; however, the patient may or may not have believed that the short extension of life was of benefit to them. Lethal condition futility is an extension of imminent demise where the expectation is that a patient will pass away in the near term regardless of receiving or undergoing an intervention; however, the short extension on life is deemed appropriate. For example, biliary stent placement in patients with advanced incurable biliary tree tumors does not reduce mortality but provides symptom reduction thus enhancing remaining quality of life. A controversial definition of futility is qualitative futility, because it requires the scientific assessment of the probability of success for a given treatment [32].",

Asrani et al. [17], on the other hand, defined futility as any adult recipient with a >50% mortality at 5 years posttransplant. Rana et al.

For example, should a patient with a MELD score > 40, age > 60 with extensive cardiac risk factors undergoing dialysis, be delisted in order to optimize organ reallocation to another individual? Would family consent be required? What body of governance would make such a decision, and would this be considered too paternalistic of an approach?

Multidisciplinary conferences, where decisions regarding high-risk cases are reviewed, play an important role in assessing not only the recipient but also the potential donor.

After reperfusion of transplanted liver, the increased venous return will exert the volume and pressure to the right heart against high pulmonary resistance resulting in right heart failure and likely death. All the potential liver transplant patients are screened with transthoracic echocardiogram where right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) is estimated based on the tricuspid jets. If the RVSP is found to be elevated, these patients undergo further testing with a right heart catherization. It is important to distinguish between primary pulmonary hypertension and volume overload which can commonly occur in patients with cirrhosis. In centers that use Swann-Ganz catheters routinely in LT, this simple measurement can identify undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension prior to starting the operation, allowing the transplant team to abort the case if the pulmonary pressure is found to be too high (>35 mm Hg).",

A cited benefit of SLKT is immune protection of the renal allograft with lower rates of acute and chronic rejection compared to sequential kidney transplant [55]. The potential drawback of SLKT is that liver recipients receive a donor kidney when their native kidney might in fact recover, resulting in a lost organ for a patient waiting for kidney-only transplantation [53]. The ultimate goal in selecting patients for SLKT is to identify which ESLD transplant candidates will develop or have irreversible kidney damage at the time of transplantation and therefore will ultimately benefit from a single operation. The difficulty lies in that there is no reliable method to identify which liver transplant candidates with concurrent kidney injury will recover renal function or eventually require a renal transplant post LT [52]. Currently, there is no universal policy for SLKT. In 2015, Puri and Eason summarized the evolution of recommendations and guidelines for SLKT outlined below [56] [Table 14.2].",

The rate of CHLTs being performed in the United States is rapidly increasing. A retrospective review of the UNOS database between 1987 and 2010 identified 97 reported cases of CHLTs [60]. The two most common primary cardiac diagnoses were amyloidosis (26.8%) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (14.4%), while the two most common primary liver diagnoses were amyloidosis (27.8%) and cardiac cirrhosis (17.5%) [60]. Other common indications for CHLT are for patients with heart and liver failure secondary to hemochromatosis and familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients with ESLD who have severe heart disease and are unfit for liver-alone transplantation [61]. Beal et al. summarized the following number of CHLTs performed at high-volume centers within the United States: Mayo clinic (n = 33), Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (n = 31), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (n = 14), University of Chicago Medical Center (n = 13), Methodist Hospital (n = 13), and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (n = 9), with the remaining centers performing \u22647 CHLT each [59].",

An interesting observation was that patients who received CHLT had lower rates of acute rejection compared to patients undergoing isolated heart transplantation [60]. A retrospective study from Mayo Clinic demonstrated that the incidence of T-cell-mediated rejection was 31.8% in CHLT recipients compared to 84.8% in isolated heart transplant recipients with similar overall incidence of antibody-mediated rejection [62]. Cannon et al. note that the average MELD score at time the time of CHLT was 13.8; however, the wait-list mortality for these patients would have been higher compared to patients with isolated hepatic failure with similar MELD scores [60]. Between January 1997 and February 2004, there were 110 patients wait-listed for CHLT within the United States; 33 patients (30%) underwent CHLT, 30 patients (27%) died, 11 patients (10%) were still wait-listed, and 34 patients received single-organ, sequential organ transplant or were awaiting transplant of the second organ [59]. A large single-center case series from the University of Bologna reported on 14 patients with combined heart and liver failure where 13 patients underwent CHLT and 1 underwent combined heart-liver-kidney transplantation. The 1-month, 1-year, and 5-year survival rates were 93, 93, and 82%, respectively, while graft free rejection at 1, 5, and 10 years for the heart was 100, 91, 36, and 100% and 91 and 86% for the liver [61].",

Double lung transplant is most often performed during CLLT instead of single lung transplant. The most common indication for CLLT is cystic fibrosis with pulmonary and liver involvement. Other indications include POPH with ESLD, hepatopulmonary fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with advanced lung and liver involvement, and sarcoidosis [64]. As with CHLT, there is a postulated immunological benefit for combined transplant, where LT is immune protective [65, 66]. There are no standardized recommendations available for CLLT, and candidacy is evaluated at each center with a multidisciplinary board committee review [64]. Potential CLLT candidates need to be placed on individual organ wait-lists. Prior to 2005, the United States and the Euro transplant region donated lungs based on patient waiting time [67]. In May 2005, the lung allocation score (LAS) was introduced, which is comprised of several patient clinical and laboratory parameters, and in the United States the LAS has replaced waiting time for determining priority of donor lungs [67]. Other European countries have followed suit over the years.",

During technically challenging cases, surgical bleedingcan be magnified by the inability of the recipient liver to produce coagulation factors and platelets for necessary clot formation. A majority of cirrhotic patients will exhibit some form of thrombocytopenia, which is secondary to increased platelet activation, consumption, and splenic sequestration of platelets associated with portal hypertension [84]. Although total number of platelets are reduced, it has been shown that in the remaining platelets, there is increased activity secondary to increased levels of von Willebrand factor and decreased levels of ADAMTS 13 [85]. All the coagulation factors are synthesized by the liver, the only exception being factor 8. In cirrhotic patients the levels of vitamin K-dependent factors fall by 25\u201370% [86].",

This is followed by removal of the recipient liver, interposition and anastomosis of the donor IVC, and liver graft to the recipient suprahepatic and infrahepatic IVC. Suprahepatic and infrahepatic IVC reconstruction is performed with 3-0 or 4-0 Prolene sutures in a running fashion. Prior to completion of the infrahepatic caval anastomosis, the donor portal vein is flushed with a preservation solution in order to rid the liver of accumulated toxins that may contribute to reperfusion syndrome. Once flushing is complete, the donor portal vein is reconstructed to the recipient portal vein in an end-to-end fashion with 6-0 Prolene sutures. Typically, a shorter portal vein reconstruction is preferred over a longer donor/recipient portal vein reconstruction with the hope of reducing kinking or development of postoperative portal vein thrombosis.",

If only two hepatic veins are used, then the right hepatic vein is ligated. The piggyback technique with partial IVC occlusion provides a theoretical advantage of maintaining venous blood flow from the infrahepatic IVC to the heart. Maintaining cardiac preload is believed to stabilize hemodynamic stability and therefore avoids large intraoperative fluid infusions and potential need for vasopressors. Additional suggested advantages of partial caval occlusion include shorter anhepatic phase and possible decreased incidence of renal injury [97]. Moreno-Gonzalez et al. retrospectively identified that the piggyback technique was associated with longer operative times but also with less intraoperative hemodynamic instability, RBC transfusions, pressors, and fluid administration [98]. Graft outflow obstruction and increased incidence of bleeding from the caval anastomosis are recognized potential complications of the piggyback technique [97]. Caval obstruction associated with the piggyback technique is thought to be secondary to a large donor graft causing compression or an inadequate graft size that can result in twisting of the caval anastomosis, ultimately leading to hepatic venous outflow obstruction [99].",

No clotting factors are produced, and the concentration of tissue plasminogen activator increases, which contributes to fibrinolysis [100]. The accumulation of citrate leads to increased binding of ionized calcium, and calcium is an important cofactor for proper hemostasis [101]. Pooled systemic blood below the IVC clamp becomes cold and hyperkalemic as lactic acid, toxic metabolites, cytokines, and free radicals accumulate and cannot be removed [102]. When the IVC and portal vein clamps are removed, circulation is restored, and the donor liver receives the systemic blood and forwards it toward the recipient heart while the portal vein provides a fresh inflow of blood.",

Mild PRS occurs when the decrease in blood pressure and or heart rate is <30% of the anhepatic blood pressure levels, lasts for \u22645 minutes, and is responsive to a 1 g intravenous bolus of calcium chloride and or intravenous boluses of epinephrine (\u2264100ug) without requiring continuous infusion of vasopressor agents [102]. Severe PRS is defined as the presence of persistent hypotension >30% of the anhepatic level, asystole, significant arrhythmias, and requirement of intraoperative or postoperative vasopressor support [102]. Severe PRS is additionally defined as prolonged (>30 minutes) or recurrent fibrinolysis requiring treatment with antifibrinolytics. The three main categories that contribute to the development of PRS are donor/organ related, recipient related, and procedure related [103]. Prolonged warm ischemia time typically >90 minutes is a procedure related factor that can contribute to the increased risk of developing PRS.",

Especially in the current climate of limited organs, surgical revascularization with donor and recipient hepatic artery reconstruction is optimal. Scarinci et al. have reported that when revascularization is performed within the first week of LT, graft salvage approaches 81% [132].

Two of seven cases were successfully managed medically with diuretics, while five of seven cases required operative cavoplasty [138]. In patients with high-pressure gradients or hepatic vein stenosis at the anastomotic site, hepatic venoplasty alone has been used as the initial management strategy followed by hepatic vein stenting if symptoms or elevated pressure gradient persist [135]. Other centers have successfully performed venoplasty with stenting as a primary option rather than venoplasty alone [137, 139, 140]. Endovascular management forHVOO is preferred over surgical repair because of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical repair [139].

Biliary complications are the most common complications post-LT, and duct ischemia is closely related to hepatic arterial complications. The biliary system is supplied only by the hepatic arterial system, and arterial anastomotic complications may lead to secondary biliary complications. Common biliary complications include strictures, leaks, stones, bile debris, and ischemia. Bile leaks and strictures occur in 2\u201325% of cases and comprise the majority of postoperative complications [142]. In a large American data set of 12,803 liver transplants, the incidence of bile duct complications was significantly higher in donation after cardiac death (DCD) recipients (23%) compared to neurologic death donor (NDD) recipients (19%) [143]. Within the same database, DCD recipients required more frequent diagnostic/therapeutic procedures (18.8% vs 14.4%), surgical revision of biliary anastomosis (4.1% vs 2.8%), and re-transplantation (9.1% vs 3.8%) when compared to NDD recipients [143]. A large meta-analysis also identified that biliary complications were significantly increased in DCD recipients compared to NDD recipients (26% versus 16%) [144]. Overall incidence of ischemic cholangiopathy was 16% in DCD recipients compared to 3% in NDD recipients [144].",

Patients may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and abdominal/shoulder pain and may develop peritonitis with or without superimposed infection. Elevated bilirubin is usually present along with elevations in lab values (GGT/ALP). Diagnosis can be made with ultrasound, with CT scan, or with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) [144]. Several management options are available. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with or without stent placement is typically utilized. Radiographically guided percutaneous drainage can be effectively used in addition to ERCP to drain a biloma. ERCP has the advantage that it is simultaneously both diagnostic and therapeutic. If the bile duct is reconstructed in an end-to-end fashion, ERCP is technically feasible. When a hepaticojejunostomy has been performed; ERCP is more challenging, requiring a skilled endoscopist, and not always technically possible. If ERCP cannot be performed, or is unable to reach the area of concern, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and drainage are required. If ERCP is unable to adequately stent or reach a leak at the biliary anastomosis, PTC can be additionally performed to control the leak. If a large biliary anastomotic defect or biliary necrosis is present early in the postoperative period, surgical revision with a redo end-to-end anastomosis, choledochojejunostomy, or hepaticojejunostomy is required. The biliary defect may be too large or degree of the biliary necrosis too significant to preserve enough bile duct length for a redo end-to-end anastomosis. Bile duct strictures mostly develop at the anastomotic site; however, non-anastomotic strictures may develop and are alternatively known as ischemic type strictures [145]. Non-anastomotic strictures can be caused by microangiopathic factors (prolonged cold/warm ischemia, hemodynamic instability) or secondary to HAT [145]. Extraction of the native recipient liver results in loss of arterial collateral circulation, and the newly implanted donor liver will not have arterial collateral circulation to supply the biliary system. Therefore, its blood supply is dependent on the hepatic arterial anastomosis. It takes approximately 2 weeks for collaterals to start to form. When blood flow is reduced to the biliary system, ischemic strictures may develop anywhere along the bile duct. Ischemic bile duct strictures are typically longer than anastomotic biliary strictures, are present in multiple locations, and are usually found at the hepatic hilum; however, they may be present throughout the intrahepatic biliary system [142].",

The SOFT score is composed of two components. There is the pre-allocation score to predict survival outcomes following LT (P-SOFT) and a SOFT score that is used to predict survival posttransplantation [34]. The SOFT score has additional variables with allotted points that can be added or subtracted from the P-SOFT score. The SOFT score can be used by the physician as an adjunct in deciding whether to accept a liver organ by estimating the 3-month postoperative mortality rate compared to a MELD estimated 3-month wait-list mortality rate. The SOFT score is the most accurate predictor of 3-month recipient survival and is also accurate for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-LT survival [34]. It was determined by the authors that the SOFT score was most accurate based on area under the curve analysis. Furthermore, the SOFT score can be used to improve donor-recipient matching [34].",

The higher the MELD score, the lower the mortality risk for deceased donor transplant recipients compared to wait-list candidates, as mortality was more likely to occur while awaiting LT, rather than from risk of mortality at 1 year posttransplantation [11]. Alternatively, deceased donor transplant recipients with MELD scores <15 had a higher risk of post-LT mortality at 1 year compared to candidates (with MELD <15) awaiting transplantation. In this analysis, the quality of donor organ was not accounted for. When high MELD score patients receive high-risk or optimal organ donors, there is a survival benefit regardless of the DRI [10]; however, in patients with low MELD scores that received high DRI organs, there is an overall decrease in posttransplant survival [26].",

The importance of optimal donor-recipient matching has heightened. Recent data has revealed that 20-year survival for post-LT recipients is significantly influenced by the DRI (\u22641.4 and >1.4) and donor age independently (<30 vs \u226530) [152]. It has been suggested that the ideal liver transplant recipient is a young woman with acute liver failure or cholestatic liver disease/autoimmune hepatitis, who has as BMI < 25, normal kidney function, and no dyslipidemia, while the optimal donor organ is <30 years old with an ET-DRI of <1.2 [152]. This optimal match is a rarity in today\u2019s clinical practice, and identifying donors that provide the best match for the sickest first or high MELD priority allocation system is paramount. An ideal match between donor and recipient would ensure that recipient survival and graft survival were optimized, where the probability of death on wait-lists, posttransplant survival, overall cost-effectiveness, and global survival benefit are all accounted for [151]. The question arises, should or shouldn\u2019t a liver be accepted for a particular patient while being cognizant of not just the immediate survival benefit of the particular recipient but also of the factors previously mentioned?",

Historically, there was an increased risk of death related to bleeding complications secondary to portal hypertension; however, improvements in prophylactic management of esophageal varices have reduced patient morbidity and mortality [161].

TIPS has shown to have a 98% technical success rate for PVT treatment pretransplant, with 92% patency rates until transplant or follow-up, without requiring post TIPS anticoagulation [165]. TIPS can also reduce complications of portal hypertension via portal bypass resulting in improved flow. However, there is high risk of hepatic encephalopathy (27% and 32% at 1 and 3 years) [165]. In a large series of nonmalignant PVT, TIPS resulted in complete recanalization in 57% of patients, 30% reduction in thrombus load, and 13% showed no improvement with an overall technical success rate of 100% [166]. It is important to note that the type of stent (bare versus covered) can impact TIPS dysfunction and the surgeon should be aware of which type of stents are available at their institution. Bare stents have been associated with increased TIPS dysfunction at 1 and 2 years (38% and 85%) compared to covered stents (21% and 29%) [166]. Thornberg et al. have also reported that portal venous recanalization TIPS is technically simpler and easier to perform via trans-splenic access compared to transhepatic access [165].

The benefit of LT was seen in MELD scores >13 regardless of presence or absence of PVT [169]. Doenecke et al. [170] retrospectively reviewed 170 liver transplant patients and identified that a MELD score < 15, and presence of PVT was associated with significantly higher perioperative mortality (33%) compared to patients with a patent portal vein (5%). Furthermore, 1-year survival was significantly lower in patients with MELD <15 and PVT compared to patients with a patent portal vein (57% versus 89%). In patients with MELD scores >15, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between a patent portal vein or presence of PVT. An important observation from these studies is that patients with PVT and MELD scores <13 should not be transplanted. A watchful approach is most beneficial along with medical management of the PVT until MELD score increases to at least >13, which would then provide a survival benefit. If PVT patients with MELD scores <13 are diagnosed with porto-pulmonary hypertension or hepatopulmonary syndrome, they may receive additional MELD score points and be considered for earlier LT.",

Portal vein stenosis management is dependent on whether the stenosis is deemed to be clinically significant or not. In asymptomatic patients with normal hepatic function, periodic observation with ultrasound has been described. However, in patients where portal venous stenosis is potentially contributing to worsening, portal hypertension intervention is required [179]. Interventional percutaneous portal vein dilatation with or without stent placement can be performed. Funaki et al. [180] and Shibata et al. [181] describe treatment of portal venous stenosis with balloon dilatation and stent insertion if pre- and post-portal vein dilatation pressure gradient is >5 mmHg or >3 mm Hg. Funaki et al. have had high success with interventional venoplasty and have eliminated the need for surgical revision, portacaval shunting or re-transplantation [180]. Management of PVT post-LT may differ between various institutions. Experience with percutaneous vein thrombolysis is limited, and few case reports have been published. For significant postoperative PVT that is not amendable to anticoagulation, portal vein angioplasty (with or without stent placement) remains as a first-line option, followed by TIPS, or re-transplantation, as a last resort.",

Total hepatic flow ranges between 800 and 1200 mL/min [184]. The hepatic inflow is supplied both by the hepatic artery and portal vein. Twenty-five percent of the total hepatic flow comes from the hepatic artery, which provides 30\u201350% of hepatic oxygen requirements [185]. Seventy-five percent of the total hepatic flow is provided by the portal vein, which provides 50\u201370% of hepatic nutritional requirements [186]. Interplay between the portal and hepatic inflow has significant impact on hepatic regeneration [187]. This is especially true after orthotopic LT and even more so for LDLT. Forty percent of the hepatic blood is within large vessels, while 60% is held within the hepatic sinusoids. Hepatic sinusoids are very compliant and can accommodate a large volume of blood so that portal venous flow can be increased or decreased without disruption to the portal venous pressure in healthy livers [185]. Significant differences can be seen in portal venous blood flow between non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients especially if extensive portal hypertension or PVT is present. Cirrhotic-induced vascular changes impact intraoperative decision-making on whether to perform standard donor to recipient vascular anastomosis versus a modified restoration of physiologic or nonphysiologic inflow. The goal is to provide optimal blood flow and tissue perfusion that are required for the metabolic activity of the liver [185].",

The high-resistance arterial system ends at hepatic sinusoids and transitions to the portal venous system via sinusoidal capillaries [190]. Under normal conditions, the portal venous system is a low-pressure, low-resistance system. It is affected by venous drainage from visceral organs, regulated by splanchnic arteriole constriction and intrahepatic vascular resistance. The hepatic artery and portal vein flows in healthy individuals are typically proportional; however, in patients with cirrhosis, it is observed that the portal vein and hepatic artery flows are inversely related to each other [191].",

When portal vein inflow increases, it causes the adenosine to be washed away with a resultant decrease in hepatic artery flow mediated by hepatic artery vasoconstriction [189]. When portal perfusion decreases via impeded or diverted portal inflow, the liver triggers adenosine to locally accumulate. Adenosine induces hepatic artery vasodilatation and increases hepatic artery blood flow in order to compensate for the reduced portal venous flow. In addition to adenosine, local nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and a gaseous mediator known as H2S have been found to change in concentration depending on the portal venous pressure [189]. The ability of the hepatic artery to vasodilate in response to changes in portal pressure is an intrinsic autoregulatory mechanism of the liver that is known as the hepatic artery buffer response (HABR) [184]. Initial clamping of the splenic artery has shown to cause an increase in hepatic artery velocity followed by a quick and maintained decreased portal venous velocity [192]. Subsequent clamping of the splenic vein induces a significantly quick and maintained decrease in the portal venous flow, with an eventual increase in hepatic arterial flow [192]. The increase in hepatic arterial blood flow is able to compensate for up to a 25\u201360% reduction in portal flow [189]. The goal of the HABR is to maintain adequate oxygen supply to tissues and minimize the impact of portal venous flow changes on hepatic clearance [184].",

Normal portal vein waveform normally shows gentle undulations with hepatopetal flow [194]. The normal waveform within the hepatic veins is triphasic with two hepatofugal phases related to the atrial and ventricular diastole. Cirrhotic changes in the liver can cause a large reduction in the visualization of hepatic veins that alters the normal waveform. The normal triphasic wave form can be replaced with a monophasic pattern that indicates high portal pressures [194]. Hepatic artery flows can be indirectly measured by the pulsatility index or estimations of the resistive index on doppler ultrasound which approximates the hepatic artery flow [191]. Portal inflow becomes partially reversed, and this is known at hepatofugal flow. Hepatofugal flow of the main portal vein is a known marker of portal hypertension, and it has been identified that a threshold velocity of 11 cm/s in the right portal vein and left portal vein velocity of <8 cm/s are associated with the development of main portal vein hepatofugal flow [195].",

Due to the increased hepatic vascular resistance, the intrahepatic endothelial cells produce less nitric oxide resulting in portal hypertension (mean intraluminal portal pressure > 12 mm Hg). In response, the extrahepatic mesenteric vascular beds cause progressive vasodilation of splanchnic vasculature secondary to increased release of nitric oxide. At baseline, the HABR in cirrhotic patients is continuously active; however, hepatic artery flow changes are blunted in response to sudden changes in portal venous flow [191, 196]. In a cirrhotic patient prior to LT, portal flow is approximately 1 L/min [188, 197]. The porto-splanchnic system attempts to redistribute the increased portal inflow; however, because of cirrhosis-induced fibrosis and increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, the liver is unable to accommodate for the increased incoming portal inflow. Preexisting and/or newly formed venous collaterals receive redistribution of hepatofugal portal flow. This leads to varices and further subsequent vascular remodeling with an overall reduction in portal venous blood flow, increased hepatic venous resistance, systemic hyperdynamic circulation, and increased cardiac output [198]. To compensate for increased intrahepatic resistance, the HABR increases hepatic arterial flow by a reduction in hepatic arterial resistance.",

However, optimal flows for the hepatic artery and portal vein are still unknown without strong quality evidence. Prior to LT, in the cirrhotic liver, portal flow is approximately 1\u20132 L/min [188, 197]. Mean hepatic artery flow has a range from 268 to 584 ml/min, with a resultant cardiac output of 10 L/ min. Spitzer et al. found that for full donor implanted grafts, a minimum hepatic artery flow of 250 ml/min is required for improved patient survival; however, flows of >400 ml/min are optimal [201].",

            "text": "Intraoperatively, different presentations of altered hepatic flow may present, namely, portal vein enlargement and splenomegaly, without significant collateral formation or reduced portal vein size with massive collateralization [185]. In the setting of a large portal vein without significant collateralization, improving portal venous and hepatic flow can be achieved with either splenectomy or splenic artery ligation [185]. Alternatively, if the portal vein is smaller than expected with large collateralization, spontaneous splenorenal shunting is likely to have occurred. Some authors report that ligation of major collaterals when portal venous flow is <1 L/min may help with preventing portal hypoperfusion [185]. Ligating large collateral coronary veins greater than 1 cm is thought to increase PV flow by 55\u2013140%, depending on the size of the varix [202]. Common veins to ligate are the coronary vein, inferior mesenteric vein, gastroepiploic vein, splenorenal shunt, and retroperitoneal varices. Large splenorenal shunts can be embolized via percutaneous methods or via intraoperative ligation of the left renal vein. The main causes of decreased portal flow are unrecognized portal mesenteric/splenic vein thrombosis, inadequate portal vein thromboendvenectomy, or large portosystemic collaterals [188]. Once a new liver graft has been transplanted, a lower portal resistance within the new graft allows for improved portal flow, which has been measured to increase to 1.8\u20132.8 L/min after implantation. Minimum portal vein flow should be >1 L as portal vein flow >1 L mL/min is associated with improved graft survival at 30, 60, and 365 days post-LT in the deceased donor transplantation [188, 197, 201].",

However, arterial steal syndrome, celiac artery stenosis, or hypoperfusion secondary to under-resuscitation can contribute to decreased hepatic artery flows. Additionally, mechanical ventilation, hypercarbia, positive end expiratory pressure, hypotension, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia are other intraoperative factors that may reduce hepatic artery flow [203]. In patients who develop hepatic artery strictures, there are significantly lower intraoperative arterial and portal vein flows compared to patients who do not develop hepatic arterial strictures [204]. Low hepatic artery RI after deceased donor LT can be attributed to surgical edema, hepatic artery stenosis, severe aorto-celiac atherosclerotic disease, arteriovenous or arterial biliary fistula formation, hepatic vein, or portal vein thrombosis [199]. The hepatic artery is the sole blood supply to the bile duct. This is supported by evidence that lower measured hepatic flows have been associated with higher rates of biliary complications after LT [205]. Therefore, ensuring proper hepatic artery flow is imperative to obtaining optimal biliary anastomotic outcomes.",

TIPS placement as a bridge to LT may result in technical difficulties during the transplant with the shunt extending into the portal vein, hepatic vein, or right atrium; however, TIPS has not shown to have any significant negative impact on graft or patient survival [208]. Even in the setting of cirrhosis complicated by nonmalignant PVT, TIPS is technically feasible and is not associated with increased procedure related complications, stent occlusion, or mortality [166]. TIPS can be used to maintain and improve patency of the portal venous system and reduce the re-occurrence of PVT. It has also been used to decrease the effect of mesosystemic collaterals and shunting of blood away from the liver [166, 209].",

            "text": "Patients with portal hypertension and advanced cirrhosis have increased resistance to portal inflow and develop portosystemic shunts; as a result, blood flow is shunted away from the portal vein and liver via the mesosystemic collaterals, otherwise known as hepatofugal flow [210]. Splenorenal shunts form between the splenic and renal veins and are an example of such spontaneous mesosystemic collateral development. Portal steal syndrome develops after LT when the mesosystemic collaterals persist and continually divert flow away from the newly implanted graft [211]. After full-sized cadaveric orthotopic LT, hepatofugal flow usually resolves, portal vein flow becomes hepatopedal and results in a decreased intrahepatic resistance [210]. However, hepatofugal flow may only slightly decrease or persist post-LT, especially in the setting of partial graft transplantation, and contribute to the development of portal steal syndrome [212]. Hyperdynamic spontaneous portosystemic shunts are present in up to 19% of portal hypertensive patients awaiting LT [210]. The higher the flow from the splenic vein into the renal vein the greater likelihood of significant blood flow diverted away from the liver [209]. When a portosystemic shunt persists post-LT, it may reduce portal inflow/portal venous pressure and impact early hepatic regeneration and harm the new graft [212, 213]. This especially applies in small-for-size grafts after LDLT [211]. Risk factors for recipient portal steal phenomenon include portal hypertension with large varices and natural shunts, chronic liver failure, macrosteatosis, low liver donor mass, donation after cardiac death with prolonged warm ischemia time and receiving a LDLT [210].",

Lee et al. describe their technique of left renal vein (LRV) ligation in 44 patients with large splenorenal shunt for portal steal syndrome during partial graft LDLT [211]. At the time of LT, intraoperative portal flow assessment of the ligated portal vein was performed when LRV was unclamped and subsequently clamped. If a large difference in portal vein flow was observed during LRV clamping, then ligation of the LRV was performed prior to hepatic arterial construction.

Although LRV ligation has been shown to be safe and effective for dealing with portal vein steal syndrome, definitive consensus indications cannot be made based on size of splenorenal shunts or threshold portal vein flows. Larger multicenter prospective studies are required.",

Currently, live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) comprises <5% of all liver transplants performed in the United States [217]. In an attempt to reduce LT wait times and increase the organ pool, LDLT was introduced as an alternative to cadaveric transplantation. LDLT was initially performed within the pediatric population; however, currently LDLT has been implemented for adult LT in high-volume centers. The left hepatic lobe has traditionally been used in the pediatric population for an appropriate donor to recipient size match, accounting for the smaller-sized pediatric population. In adults, left lobe implantation was initially utilized; however, initial results were poor due to small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) and early graft dysfunction. In the late 1990s, adult right hepatic lobe LDLT was increasingly utilized in order to circumvent SFSS [218]. Recent studies have shown that left hepatic lobe donation is associated with favorable recipient and donor outcomes compared to right hepatic lobe LDLT [217]. Despite this, right LDLT remains the most commonly utilized lobe in adult LDLT due to the ability of the right lobe to provide consistently more reliable hepatic mass [219].",

Minor donor complications are reported to occur in approximately 27% of donors, with the most common complications being biliary leaks (9%), bacterial infections (12%), and incisional hernias (6%) [221]. Several studies have shown that donor outcomes with left lobe LDLT is associated with lower complication rates, lower rates of serious complications, and identical 1-, 5-, 10-year recipient survival compared to right lobe LDLT [222\u2013224].

The most pronounced hemodynamic changes are an increase in portal perfusion rate and cardiac output of the recipient secondary to the effects of cirrhosis [226]. Typically, a whole transplanted liver has a large vascular bed of hepatic sinusoids to accommodate for the increased portal flow and cardiac output [218]. The liver compensates for the increased portal vein flow and cardiac output by activating the HABR, which reduces hepatic artery inflow. The live partial donor graft must manage the hyperdynamic portal circulation secondary to high portal flow immediately after LT. With LDLT it is believed that within minutes of reperfusion, portal hyperperfusion can cause shear stress to hepatocytes, sinusoidal congestion, and hemorrhagic necrosis of peri-sinusoidal hepatocytes [227, 228].",

Doppler studies have shown that hepatic artery vasoconstriction in response to portal hyperperfusion and an exaggerated HABR produce a high resistive index with poor arterial perfusion [199]. Additionally, excessive portal flow can lead to oxidative stress thereby activating the inflammatory cascade leading to further hepatocyte damage [230]. The major concern is for graft dysfunction and secondary biliary complications. The symptoms of SFSS manifest as a pattern of liver dysfunction with associated portal hypertension, diminished arterial inflow, delayed synthetic function, and prolonged cholestasis. In advanced cases of SFSS, patients can clinically decompensate with the development of sepsis, encephalopathy, and death [231]. SFSS is typically thought to occur when the donor graft to recipient weight ratio (GRWR) is <0.8% during the first postoperative week after excluding other causes of graft dysfunction [232]. However, studies have identified that GRWR of 0.6 in LDLT is safe [233, 234]. Others have shown that GRWR of 0.6% and 0.85% is safe in Child Pugh Class A recipients, while Child Pugh Class B and C recipients require GRWR >0.85% for appropriate outcomes [235]. The International Liver Transplantation Society Living Donor Liver Transplant Recipient Guidelines state that the safety limit for minimum GRWR can be less than 0.8% in the setting of improved center experience and patient selection; however, most centers consider GRWR of 0.8% as the lower limit [219].",

Portal venous pressure has been considered the most important hemodynamic factor influencing the functional status of the liver and graft regeneration post-LT [199]. It has been demonstrated that portal venous pressure < 15 mm Hg results in improved 2-year survival compared to patients with portal venous pressures >15 mmHg [236]. Wu et al. have demonstrated that high portal venous flow was well-tolerated by right LDLT recipients postoperatively if initial portal pressure was <23 mm Hg and the postreperfusion portal venous pressure was <15 mm Hg [213]. Furthermore, when initial portal venous pressure is \u226523 mmHg, and after reperfusion \u226515 mmHg, patients developed significantly more ascites compared to patients with lower portal venous pressures [213]. Optimal portal venous flows and hepatic arterial inflow remain a topic of debate, dependent on right or left LDLT and the true impact of HABR [185, 188]. It has been shown that portal venous flows <180 ml/min/100 g of liver weight (LW) leads to lower survival [237] and experimental models have supported that optimal outcomes occur with portal venous flows <260 ml/min/100 g LW [238]. It is believed that in order to avoid SFSS, portal venous flows of <260 mL min per 100 g LW are recommended [239] and graft inflow modulation techniques should be employed if the portal venous flow is >250 ml/min/100 g LW [240].",

Splenic artery ligation [242] is usually the first step in portal flow modulation; however, splenectomy [243], portacaval, mesocaval, and splenorenal shunts are alternative options. Splenic artery ligation reduces portal vein flow by 30% [240] by reducing resistance of the distal hepatic artery and subsequently reducing flow in the splenic circulation. The net effect of splenic artery ligation/embolization results in promotion of liver regeneration and overcoming the effects of portal hypertension and portal hyperperfusion [244]. If elevated portal pressures are identified postoperatively, splenic artery embolization can be performed via interventional radiological methods. Splenectomy is potentially life-threatening, and if splenic artery ligation is technically feasible, it should be a primary management option. Portocaval shunts are believed to be beneficial when lower portal venous flows of 190/mL/min/100 g LW are present compared to higher flows of 401 mL/min/100 g [245].",

However, LDLT has been demonstrated to have similar postoperative complication rates and survival outcomes compared to DDLT [146, 247]. An adult-to-adult LDLT cohort multicenter retrospective study reported a 13.2% graft failure rate in 385 ALDLT recipients in the first 90 days [248]. The group identified that older recipient age and length of cold ischemia were significant predictors of graft failure, while individual center experience greater than 20 ALDLT was associated with lower risk of graft failure. Also, recipient MELD score was not a significant predictor of graft failure, but this sub analysis was limited to a small percentage (4%) of patients with MELD scores >30. [248]. The same group reported a 90-day and 1-year recipient survival of 94% and 89%, respectively. This was a seminal paper, as this was the first multicenter study of donor and recipient LDLT outcomes. A follow-up study identified that adjusted long-term mortality risk between LDLT and DDT was similar (for recipient gender, age, diagnosis, dialysis, MELD, and donor age) [249].",

High MELD patients awaiting LT have a high wait-list mortality and, as discussed previously, demonstrate significant benefit from transplantation. If deceased donor organ is not available for sick/high MELD patients, consideration should be made to utilize LDLT. However, ethical issues arise regarding the benefit risk ratio for donors undergoing a significant life-transforming event for a potentially futile recipient transplant outcome. In 2006, at the Vancouver Forum on the Care of the Live Organ Donor LDLT was deemed appropriatefor acutely ill and sick transplant candidates [250]. However, LDLT in patients with MELD scores >25 remains controversial. It has been shown that in patients with MELD scores >20 undergoing LDLT, preoperative renal dysfunction, severe hypoalbuminemia, and massive intraoperative RBC transfusion are independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. In recipients with two or more risk factors, 3-month survival was 25% [251].",

Feng summarizes the findings of several authors from both Eastern and Western transplant centers that have demonstrated good survival in patients with elevated MELD scores undergoing LDLT [253]. Selzner et al. in a large series compared outcomes in patients with MELD scores <25 and >25 in 271 consecutive adult-to-adult right lobe LDLT [246]. They demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the overall complication rate within 3 months of LT between MELD <25 and MELD >25 recipients (51% versus 45%, p = 0.28). Graft survival between MELD <25 and MELD >25 was not significantly different at 1 year (92% vs 83%), 3 years (86% versus 80%) and 5 years (78% versus 80%), and patient survival was similar between groups at 1 year (92% versus 83%), 3 years (86% versus 83%), and 5 years (82% versus 83%) [246]. Kaido et al. have also shown that overall recipient patient survival did differ between patients with MELD scores <25 and \u226525 who underwent LDLT [254]. Liu et al. found that LDLT for patients with acute on chronic HBV with mean MELD scores of 36 had similar patient survival compared to elective LDLT in patients with mean MELD scores of 17.8 with a median follow-up of 23 months (88% versus 84%) [255]. In 2013, Chok et al. displayed similar 1- and 5-year LDLT recipient survival for MELD \u226525 (95.9% and 93.2%) compared to MELD <25 (96.9% and 95.3%) [256].",
