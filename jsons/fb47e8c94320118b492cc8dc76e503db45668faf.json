Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures. Testing the hypothesis: A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Implications of hypothesis: If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit. Conclusions: In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.",

Under normal conditions, pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PPR) on resident innate immune cells sense viral RNA molecules that trigger anti-viral, interferon (IFN) expression which prevents replication and promotes the removal of infected cells [5] . However, genomic studies conducted on the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) demonstrate that the virus encodes for proteins that serve as innate immune antagonists by suppressing the expression of IFN and promoting evasion of viral RNA from host defense mechanisms, independent of pro-inflammatory cytokine release [5] . As a result, early in infection, innate toll-like receptor (TLR) and PRR signaling pathways continue to potentiate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (i.e., TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IP10 or CXCL10, etc.) while viral replication remains unchecked. Hence, it has been theorized, coronaviruses pathogenesis involves the delayed release of IFN and an accumulation of monocyte/macrophages together with an inappropriate T-cell response [6] . Adding support to this etiology, severe cases of COVID-19 appear to present with dysregulated T-cell counts and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels [7] .",

Subsequently, clinical studies are now confirming similar responses in COVID-19 patients. In a study published in the Lancet, COVID-19 patients exhibit increased plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN\u03b3, CXCL10, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 [9] .

            "text": "It has been proposed this hyperinflammatory response triggers a violent attack on the body that potentiates cytokine storm development [10] . Studies demonstrate that viral infections, through both the result of viralinduced cellular toxicity and the immune response itself, drive the production of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules that are recognized by innate TLRs. For example, Imai et al. have demonstrated that oxidized phospholipids, generated by reactive oxygen species following exposure to inactivated influenza virus, lead to TLR4-mediated alveolar macrophage cytokine release and acute lung injury (ALI) in mouse models [11] . Importantly, they also found that inactivated influenza virus causes oxidative stress and TLR4 mobilization in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [11] . In addition, viral infections have been shown to induce TLR4mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the release of the DAMP molecules S100 calcium-binding protein A9 and high mobility group box 1; proteins normally sequestered inside the cell [12, 13] . Functionally, blocking TLR4 protects from and TLR\u2212/\u2212 mice are highly resistant to influenza-induced lethality [11, 14] . It is also important to note, that TLR4 signaling may contribute to fibrosis, further complicating management of COVID-19 [15] . These observations suggest that DAMP-mediated TLR signaling is an important therapeutic target in COVID-19, to reduce feed-back loops potentially critical for cytokine storm development. Interestingly, T-cells infected with SARS-CoV exhibit elevated expression of TLR4, 7, and 9, further demonstrating that this is a critical target for coronavirus intervention [16] .",

This is reflected in the ability of LMWF5A to inhibit the release of a key set of cytokines and chemokines associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in ex vivo human PBMC models activated through innate pattern recognition pathways. For example, LMWF5A reduces TNF\u03b1 release by human PBMC stimulated using LPS as an agonist for TLR4 signaling ( Fig. 1 ) [19] . LPS-stimulation mimics the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and DAMP signaling seen in the end stage of disease where excessive viral loads and tissue damage trigger excessive induction of the immune response. Subsequent unpublished findings show that this response extends to a reduction of CXCL10, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-12 as well. Thus, demonstrates that LMWF5A treatment appears to target the release of a pattern of cytokines observed in COVID-19 and other viral cytokine storms.",

Alveolar macrophages are the predominant tissue resident immune cells found in the lung and are likely to be involved in both the early anti-viral response and trophic end-stages of tissue damage and recovery. In addition, pleiotropic monocytes, invading across the capillary-epithelial bed, will differentiate into proinflammatory M1 macrophages upon arrival and may contribute to the excessive immune response in the lung [26] . Moreover, macrophages that develop into an inflammatory M1 lineage become a potent source of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, CXCL10), furthering inflammation [26, 27] . Of note, the balance of macrophage polarization between the microbial/IFN\u03b3-induced M1 phenotypes and the antiinflammatory M2 could dictate the amplitude of classical activation versus neutrophil efferocytosis and immune resolution, respectively, during pulmonary insult [28] .",

Animal models demonstrate that T-cells facilitate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, and the arrival of neutrophils in the lung [29] . As observed with macrophage polarization, this may result from an imbalance in inflammatory and regulatory subsets. For example, the ratio of pro-inflammatory Th17 to T regulatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of patients has been found to be predictive of 28-day mortality with ARDS [30] . In support of this evidence, activated and proliferating pro-inflammatory T-cells have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from ARDS patients [31] . Moreover, lymphocyte counts have been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19 with patients who die exhibiting significant leukopenia [32] . These cells represent a potentially [19] underappreciated source of both IFN\u03b3 and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, and contributors of disease progression in COVID-19. Once in the lung, INF\u03b3 priming of T-cells will provide for intense, superantigenlike signaling that may exacerbate autocrine and paracrine cytokine activity.

LMWF5A was found to reduce TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 release from CD3/28-stimulated PBMC and influenza HA antigen-presented human T-cell clones [17] . This activity was attributed, in part, to an identified diketopiperazine molecule formed by the cleavage and cyclization of the two N-terminal amino acids of human serum albumin, DA-DKP, present in LMWF5A. Treatment of these cells with DA-DKP resulted in significant reductions of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 release from antigen presented T-cells clones [18] . Interestingly, this effect appears to be specific to memory (CD45RO+) but not na\u00efve (CD45RA+) phenotypes (unpublished findings). These findings demonstrated that LMWF5A can reduce cytokine release during an adaptive immune response triggered by the presentation of antigen or activation of T-cells. Therefore, with respect to COVID-19, LMWF5A may shift the overall inflammatory response away from the hypercytokine production observed as the disease transitions to ARDS without impacting the body's ability to fight the primary viral infection.",

A source of endogenous AhR ligands are tryptophan metabolites, and one of the active ingredients in LMWF5A is nacetyl-tryptophan, suggesting that AhR activation contributes to the immunomodulatory action of LMWF5A. The effect on AhR activity was confirmed using an AhR antagonist (CH223191) in the THP-1 model described above. When an AhR antagonist was added to these macrophage-like cultures, the IL-6 response was partially attenuated, demonstrating that the AhR activation plays a partial role in the reducing of cytokine observed in this model. However, AhR antagonism had no significant effect on CXCL10 inhibition, indicating other pathways are involved in LMWF5A activity as well [21] . Another target pathway for activity was identified based on the fact that endogenous PPAR ligands are comprised of fatty acids and their derivatives, and LMWF5A contains the fatty acid, caprylate. Furthermore, 15-delta prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a resolving prostaglandin known to be a natural ligand for PPAR\u03b3, is upregulated by LMWF5A (to be discussed more below). To establish the contribution of PPAR in our models, DNA-binding and pathway specific antagonism was evaluated. Preliminary findings suggest that human PBMC treated with LMWF5A exhibited increased PPAR DNA binding and the addition of the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 to these cultures results in the attenuation of the LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 inhibition. Together, these data indicate that both AhR and PPAR transcriptional pathways play a role in the anti-inflammatory responses observed by LMWF5A.",

            "text": "A large body of evidence suggests that AhR and PPAR signaling plays a pivotal role in immunosuppression and the direction of regulatory immune cell phenotypes. To illustrate, AhR has been shown to suppress NF-\u03baB activity by: increasing DNA binding of the NF-\u03baB subunit p50 (p50)/p50 NF-\u03baB homodimer to competitively inhibit the active p50/ NF-\u03baB subunit p65 (RelA) heterodimer [42] , sequestering co-regulators (RelA, NF-\u03baB subunit RelB) to prevent translocation into the nucleus [43] and direct trans-repression in the presence of STAT1 [44] . AhR also promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-10, IL-21) and the differentiation of T-cells to regulatory phenotypes through cross-talk with the transcription factors proto-oncogene c-Maf and STAT3 [45, 46] . As with AhR, PPAR has been shown to suppress NF-\u03baB activity by: binding to DNA and directly interacting with the RelA and p50 subunits of NF-\u03baB, inducing the expression of inhibitor NF-\u03baB protein, sequestering coactivators required for NF-\u03baB such as CREB-binding protein, and releasing the repressor B-cell lymphoma 6 protein which redirects its activity towards NF-\u03baB-mediated promoters [47] . This activity decreases the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathway, including TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 [47, 48] . More importantly, the PPAR\u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone, is protective of endotoxin induced ARDS in rat models with marked reductions in nitric oxide and oxidative damage observed [49] . Based on these results, we suspect that activation of these pathways could help suppress the release of key cytokines, such as IL-6, during COVID-19, provide additional control over proinflammatory signaling pathways, and potentially rebalance inflammatory immune cells to regulatory and immunotolerant phenotypes that appear to be missing in critical stages of ARDS.",

In our LPS-stimulated PBMC investigations, we found that unlike the steroid dexamethasone, which reduces cytokine and prostaglandin release, LMWF5A inhibits TNF\u03b1 release while potentiating the production of pro-resolving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 15d-PGJ2 in these cultures (Fig. 2) [20] . On the other hand, treatment with ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, strongly attenuates prostaglandin release but does not result in a significant reduction in TNF\u03b1 release. Consequently, LMWF5A offers a distinctive immunomodulatory profile to other hallmark antiinflammatory drugs. Western blot analysis shows that LMWF5A accomplishes this by upregulating prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2) expression [20] . A similar PGE2 response is observed in macrophage-like cell culture models using PMAdifferentiated U937 monocytic cells stimulated with LPS, suggesting that while LMWF5A can suppress proinflammatory cytokines, healing and resolution phase mediators are still produced and possibly enhanced by treatment.",

Hangai et al. found that PGE2 release from necrotic macrophages may represent a mechanism to suppress DAMP-induced inflammation and that inhibition of COX-2 results in elevated serum TNF\u03b1 levels in liver necrotic models [50] . Interestingly, studies have also shown that PGE2 in the wound site is sufficient to drive the reverse migration of neutrophils as well as promote the apoptosis of neutrophils and efferocytosis critical for the resolution phase of the inflammatory process [51] . The authors further hypothesized that this activity is temporally important, in part, to allow neutrophils to perform critical functions, then provide timely resolution. While it is certain that DAMP signaling has evolved to help achieve homeostasis after insult or injury, excessive and/or sustained responses can exacerbate disease. As a result, compensatory mechanisms exist within the biologic milieu and it appears that LMWF5A may help drive lipidmediated feed-back loops of immunosuppression.",

For example, in some coronavirus studies, it has been shown that the virus manipulates prostaglandin release from infected cells during different phases of infection. Fang et al. showed that SARS-CoV achieves this is by membrane protein-induced down regulation of NF-\u03baB, with a resulting reduction in COX-2 expression [52] . The authors suggest that this is a protective measure by the virus to evade the immune response in the early stages of infection. In addition, the host response with these molecules also appears to dictate disease progression. To illustrate, in mouse studies, age-related differences in PGD2 release result in defective migration of dendritic cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activity into the lung [53] . Furthermore, it has also been found that anti-inflammatory PGD2 signaling, through D-prostanoid receptor 1, reduces inflammasome-induced IL-1\u03b2 release and mortality in coronavirus-infected mice [54] . Finally, influenza studies have established that 15d-PGJ2 treatment protects mice against lethal influenza infection through a PPAR\u03b3dependent mechanism with a marked reduction in viral load and lung inflammation observed [55] . It has been theorized that bioactive lipids, such as arachidonic acid, may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds, thus, together with the findings above, prostaglandins could provide a therapeutic advantage for ARDS secondary to viral infections such as COVID-19 [56] .",

Altogether, these data on the molecular mechanisms and more general functional effects of LMWF5A demonstrate how this biologic may prove useful for the treatment of lung vasogenic edema by enhancing the alveolar-epithelial barrier via altering GTPase activity, promoting cortical f-actin rearrangement, and stabilizing the microtubule network.",

Briefly, this trial is designed to enroll up to ten (10) patients, randomized 1:1 to nebulized LMWF5A plus standard of care (SOC) for ARDS (active arm, n = 5) or SOC for ARDS (control arm, n = 5). The primary trial objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nebulized LMWF5A in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection. The secondary trial objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nebulized Ampion versus control in improving the clinical course and outcomes of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection including mortality, ventilator free days and PaO2/FiO2 ratio.",
