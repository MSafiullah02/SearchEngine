Activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is a trigger that may initiate an inflammatory cascade and leads to the upregulation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [15]. NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of these cytokines by directly binding to the consensus sequences in their enhancer/promoter regions [5, 6, 8]. In addition, activation of NF-\u03baB can be induced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins, radiation and other stimulating agents. Importantly, the activation of NF-\u03baB is observed in alveolar macrophages from patients with ARDS [18], indicating the implication of NF-\u03baB pathway in the development and progression of ALI and ARDS. Therefore, determining whether pharmacologic inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibits the development and progression of ALI may provide a novel more effective therapeutic option for treatment of this disease.",

The rectal temperature of rats was significantly decreased 1 h after LPS administration compared with control group. In contrast, no significant differences among all groups at 8 h were observed. These results indicate that rectal temperature could fully recover within 8 h after the onset of LPS-induced ALI. Immediate intratracheal instillation of NF-\u03baB siRNA had minimal effect on the changes induced by LPS (Fig. 3). LPS administration significantly reduced white blood cell counts at each time point. At 1 h after LPS administration, immediately intratracheal instillation of NF-\u03baB siRNA did not efficiently increase white blood cell counts. In contrast, at 8 h after LPS administration, it significantly increased white blood cell counts. There were no significant differences in white blood cell counts between LPS + DEPC group and LPS+ scramble group at each time point (Fig. 4). Compared with control group, the lung wet/dry weight ratio was obviously enhanced after LPS administration at each time point. Rats with NF-\u03baB siRNA instillation had a reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio. No significant differences in the lung wet/dry weight ratio were observed between LPS + DEPC group and LPS+ scramble group at each time point (Fig. 5). The above results showed that NF-\u03baB siRNA obviously increased white blood cell counts at 8 h and reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio in LPS-induced ALI rats.\n\n\n",

Sepsis serves as a leading predisposing factor of ALI and may be the direct result of the LPS on the outer membrane of various gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, LPS can be used to establish ALI animal models through intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection and intratracheal instillation [6]. At the present time, clinical trials with the use of pharmacologic options abound and include but are not limited to the following [16]: 1, Anti-endotoxin and anti-cytokine therapy; 2, Anti-adhesion molecule therapy; 3, Alveolar surfactant replacement therapy; 4, treatment with glucocorticoids which attenuate fibrosis, among others. Despite numerous options, glucocorticoids are among the few that have attained clinical usage. However, their disappointing efficacy in the acute phase of ALI and increased risk of infection leaves much to be desired. In the present study, we undertook the challenge of identifying a novel strategy that was both effective in the early stages of ALI and devoid of side effects by using RNA interference.",

The key of RNA interference (RNAi) lies in delivery and stable expression of siRNA and has been used to cure disorders of the eyes, lungs and central nervous systems [1, 2, 4, 20, 21]. Bitko et. al for the first time demonstrated that intranasal instillation of siRNA free of transfection reagents exerted a robustly anti-inflammatory effect on individual as well as joint infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV), and that when properly designed; direct siRNA administration turns out to be feasible in the treatment of lung diseases. Moreover, this method displays many advantages [1]. First, direct siRNA administration through the respiratory system is relatively simple, noninvasive, and compatible with an inhaler or mist based therapy. Second, the exclusion of a virus-based carrier in this method reduces the potential risk of carrier side effect. Therefore, we employed intratracheal instillation of siRNA to curb the NF-\u03baB pathway activation. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, we were able to effectively target and significantly decrease NF-kB levels in our preclinical model. By using the highly specific siRNA approach, we were able to decrease the detectable levels of NF-kB after LPS administration in rat lungs at 1 and 8 h intervals. These results show that specific siRNA targeting of NF-kB can be accomplished and thus help establish and validate our preclinical model.",

Our data demonstrate that upon ALI induction followed by siRNA, the level of lung injury can be significantly altered (Fig. 1). In addition to decreasing lung injury, NF-kB knockdown also resulted in a remarkable decline in lung wet/dry weight ratio (Fig. 5). Multiple attempts have been made through the years to suppress ALI by blocking NF-\u03baB pathway, including stabilization of I\u03baB\u03b1 [8, 9, 11, 12], inhibition of binding between activated NF-\u03baB dimers and target genes via decoy oligonucleotides [3], and transcriptional inhibition of key components of the NF-\u03baB pathway via antisense technology [17]. Recently, drugs such as butyrate [14] and pitavastatin [19] were found to be effective in preventing the initiation of ALI by interacting with NF-\u03baB pathway. These attempts, however, have limited clinical merit primarily because they cannot specifically block the NF-\u03baB pathway without impairing other cellular activities, leading to known and unknown side effects. Furthermore, the necessary pretreatment is also a bottleneck in clinical practice. In contrast, the high specificity of siRNA without the need of pretreatment in our study makes it a more ideal strategy compared with other methods. Taken together, our data represent a novel and highly effective way to specifically target NF-kB, reduce lung injury while minimizing detrimental and unwanted side effects.",
