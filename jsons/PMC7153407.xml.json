Medical science, especially the contemporary Western version, is highly dependent on classification systems or disease nosology, and a number of classifications systems are utilized to categorize health conditions. From a practical standpoint, epidemiologists, medical practitioners, and healthcare administrators must be able to place health conditions into appropriate categories for a variety of reasons, and the relevant system depends on the intended purposes. For example, the system used to classify physical illness differs from that used to classify mental illness.",

The use of modern diagnostic techniques and sophisticated biomedical testing equipment has complicated the classification of disease as ever finer distinctions can be made between various syndromes. Part of the problem stems from controversy over exactly how \u201cdisease\u201d should be defined. The reality is that disease syndromes are not necessarily clear-cut and mutually exclusive, diagnostic tests are far from precise, and conventional standards for defining diseases tend to shift in accordance with new research findings, new treatment modalities, and even nonclinical developments. These problems\u2014and the concomitant criticisms\u2014are exacerbated when attempts are made at classifying disabilities or mental disorders. The systems that have been developed, therefore, although widely used, are not without their critics. Although less than perfect, these existing classification systems provide the framework within which medical science operates.",

The form and organization of the system are similar to WHO\u2019s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) especially in many of its subcategories; the overall structure, however, is informed by a theory of \u201cplanes of experience\u201d in the development of illness and disability. This gives rise to four main categories: disease/disorder, impairment, disability, and handicap. The WHO manual describes these planes of experience as follows:Something abnormal occurs within the individual; this may be present at birth or acquired later. A chain of causal circumstances, the \u201cetiology,\u201d gives rise to changes in the structure or functioning of the body, the \u201cpathology.\u201d These features are reflective of the medical model of disease.Someone becomes aware of such an occurrence, and the pathological state is exteriorized. Most often the individual himself becomes aware of disease manifestations, usually referred to as \u201cclinical disease.\u201d In behavioral terms, the individual has become or been made aware that he is unhealthy.The performance or behavior of the individual may be altered as a result of this awareness, either consequentially or cognitively. Common activities may become restricted, and in this way the experience is objectified. Also relevant are psychological responses to the presence of disease. These experiences represent \u201cdisabilities,\u201d which reflect the consequences of impairments in terms of functional performance and activity by the individual.Either the awareness itself, or the altered behavior or performance to which this gives rise, may place the individual at a disadvantage relative to others, thus socializing the experience. This plane reflects the response of society to the individual\u2019s experience, or to the extent to which the condition is a \u201chandicap.\u201d\n",

Chronic diseases typically do not kill people, but those affected typically die from some complication (of diabetes, AIDS or cancer, for example).

Since virtually every death is accompanied by a death certificate, the information on cause of death is fairly complete. However, given today\u2019s morbidity patterns, it is increasingly difficult to specify the ultimate cause of death. With a preponderance of chronic diseases, it is often the case that death can and should be attributed to a factor other than the proximate cause of death. For example, patients with AIDS do not typically die as a direct result of AIDS but due to system failure caused by AIDS. Similarly, individuals affected by diabetes are often said to die from \u201ccomplications of diabetes.\u201d While the immediate cause of death may be kidney failure, it is useful to know that diabetes was the underlying cause. Similarly, obesity, while not an immediate cause of death, is increasingly being listed as a contributing factor. While the death certificate provides space for the recording of contributing conditions, the complexity of chronic disease may make it difficult to determine the exact cause of death.",

            "text": "While death certificates represent a significant source of data for mortality analysis, there are issues that require caution in their use. There is not universal agreement as to the determination of which factor is the immediate cause of death. There are, in fact, differences that exist from community to community with regard to the classification of contributing and proximate factors. There may also be a tendency, hopefully not widespread, to misrepresent the cause of death for various reasons. There may be reluctance, for example, to specify AIDS or some other sexually transmitted disease as a cause of death. Similarly, there may be reticence with regard to specifying alcohol- or drug-related conditions as the cause of death. The slippage with regard to accurate classification of cause of death is also exacerbated due to the trend toward employment of coroners who are not physicians. In fact, in some jurisdictions, the coroner may be an elected office. For these reasons, it is important to use mortality data with caution and certainly to consider the full variety of contributors to mortality.",
