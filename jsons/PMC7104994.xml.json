It is widely distributed in China, Tibetan Plateau, Bhutan, Nepal and north east regions of India at an altitude of 3500\u20135000 metres above sea level. In Chinese, it is called as Dong Chong Xia Cao which means \u201cwinter worm summer grass\u201d (Li et al., 2006a, Li et al., 2006b). Traditionally it is known as herbal Viagra. It is also called as caterpillar fungus as it parasitizes Lepidopteran larvae, deposits spores, grows through the insect and eventually mummify it. Following overwintering, the fungus ruptures the host body and forms the stroma (fruiting body) that are connected to the dead larva as shown in Fig. 1\n. At present, there are more than 680 species coming under the genus Cordyceps (Holliday, Cleaver, & Wasser, 2005) but usually Cordyceps refers precisely to the species C. sinensis (Holliday and Cleaver, 2008, Mizuno, 1999). Both dead larva and fruiting body have been used as a traditional medicine and health food for hundreds of years for \u201clung invigoration and kidney nourishment\u201d in China (Dong and Yao, 2007, Kuo et al., 1994). Many aspects pertaining to the research on CS is well reviewed (Halperin, 1999).",

In Chinese Pharmacopoeia it has been officially classified as a drug since 1964. Further, its usage has been increased due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 and recently claimed treatments against nervous system, cardiovascular diseases, tumors, aging, respiratory, renal, liver, hypo-sexuality and hyperlipidemia (Chen et al., 2006, Kuo et al., 2006, Wang and Shiao, 2000). CS is marketed as a dietary supplement under considerations by the FDA and hence, there is a great market demand for cordyceps increasing in many countries (Dong & Yao, 2007). In TCM, cordyceps has always been revered. The increase in its popularity has led to over-harvesting and subsequent scarcity of wild species (Holliday et al., 2004, Hsu et al., 2002). Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Management Authority of China has officially classified this fungus as an endangered species (CITES Management Authority of China, 2012). Further, researchers looked forward to cultivate this species on artificial medium and by mid-1990\u2019s, artificially cultivated CS are marketed all over the world (Holliday et al., 2004, Mizuno, 1999). Promising methods like bioreactor cultivating technology have been followed to cultivate isolated living strains from natural CS to meet human needs and to reduce the pressure on natural resources of the species (Dong & Yao, 2007). Cultured and fermented mycelial products with similar pharmacologically active components are now used in clinical practice (Zhu et al., 1998a, Zhu et al., 1998b).",

The value of 1 kg caterpillars was estimated at about 30,000\u201360,000 Nepali rupees in Nepal, and about Rs. 100,000 in India (Sharma, 2004). During the year 2011 the value of 1 kg of caterpillars increased from 350,000 to 450,000 Nepali rupees in Nepal.

Although this methodology harvests the mycelium with maximum bio-actives recovery and this can be well-known low price technique but disadvantage is, mycelia contains high content of grain matter than actual CS substance. Similarly Cleaver, Holliday, and Powers (2011) studied artificial cultivation of CS on substrate (Cleaver et al., 2011) and also reported a novel method for hybridizing different strains of CS for the purpose of obtaining strains having the medicinal, health stimulating properties comparable or improved relative to strains of CS grown in the wild (Cleaver, Holliday, & Powers, 2005). Solid fermentation conditions were optimized through single factor test to recover maximum polysaccharides where soybean meal and rice bran (1:2 w/w) as substrates and arrived at optimum amount of inoculation (20%), fermentation temperature (26 \u00b0C), water content of medium (60%), air relative humidity (60%) and fermentation time (7 days) (Wu, Chen, & Hao, 2009).",

            "text": "Polysaccharides are major contributors to the most of biological activities of CS. It is challenging to use these as markers for quality control because of structural complexity and macro molecular mass. Guan, Zhao, Feng, Hu, and Li (2011) attempted qualitative analysis and characterization of polysaccharides by a method called \u201cSaccharide mapping\u201d (Guan & Li, 2010) and reported a range of monomers that build a macromolecular mass of polysaccharide containing major (1\u21924)-\u03b2, (1\u21924)-\u03b1, (1\u21926)-\u03b1-glucosidic and 1\u21924-\u03b2-d-mannosidic linkages, etc. (Guan et al., 2011). Further, content of carbohydrates extracted by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) extraction in both natural and cultured CS compared and 10 monosaccharides (rhamnose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose, galactose, mannitol, fructose and sorbose) were determined by GC\u2013MS (Guan, Yang, & Li, 2010). Methylation, Smith degradation, acetolysis, NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 13C\u20131H 2D-COSY) and acid hydrolysis studies were conducted to determine the structural features of d-glucan (backbone composed of (1\u21924)-d-glucosyl residues and carried a single (1\u21926)-linked d-glucosyl residue), which exhibits immune stimulating properties (Yalin, Cuirong, & Yuanjiang, 2006) and in another study the structural analysis of a neutral (1\u21923), (1\u21924)-\u03b2-d-glucan was done by NMR and IR spectroscopic measurements (Yalin, Cuirong, & Yuanjiang, 2005). Mannitol (sugar alcohol) is another compound that found to have anti-oxidant activity extracted from natural (32.22 \u00b1 1.5 g/100 g of extract) and cultured mycelia (21.77 \u00b1 0.73 g/100 g of extract) of CS (Dong & Yao, 2007). A neutral mannoglucan (Man and Glc units in the molar ratio of 1:9) was characterized using chemical analysis and NMR and IR spectroscopy, and its structure reveals \u03b1-d-glucan backbone with (1\u21924) and (1\u21923)-linkages, and the side chains of \u03b1-d-(1\u21926)-Manp were attached to the back bone via O-6 of \u03b1-(1\u21923)-Glcp residues (Wu, Hu, Pan, Zhou, & Zhou, 2007b). From ascocarps of CS, by hot water extraction and ethanol fractionation galactomannan was purified from CS-I and its structure was elucidated using periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, methylation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, and 13C NMR spectrometry, revealed that it contains mannan core as (1\u21922)-\u03b1-linked-d-mannopyranosyl residues and galactosyl as branch contains (1\u21923), (1\u21925), and (1\u21926)-linked-d-galactofuranosyl, (1\u21924)-linked-d-galactopyranosyl residues (Toshio, Naoko, & Haruki, 1977) and in another study a minor protein containing galactomannan from 5% sodium carbonate extract of CS was found (Kiho, Tabata, & Ukai, 1986). Nie et al. (2011) studied the structural features of hydrophilic polysaccharide (CBHP) using methylation analysis and 2D NMR spectroscopy. According to them, the polysaccharide structure is composed mainly of glucose (95.19%) that constitutes backbone where Glcp units were linked through \u03b1-1,4 linkage (65.7%), followed by t-Glcp (20.7%), 1,2,3,6-Glcp (4.1%), 1,2,4,6-Glcp (3.0%), 1,3,6-Glcp (2.0%), 1,4,6-Glcp (1.6%), and 1,2-Manp (1.9%) and 1,3-Galp (1.0%) and the branching points are located at O-2 or O-6 of Glcp with \u03b1-terminal-d-Glcp as side chain. The trace amounts of 1,2-Manp and 1,3-Galp linkages are probably located randomly in the side chains (Nie et al., 2011).",

The nucleosides content differs among natural and cultured CS (Li et al., 2001c). Many other nucleosides have been found including uridine, several distinct structures of deoxyuridines, adenosine, 2\u2032-3\u2032-dideoxyadenosine, hydroxyethyladenosine, cordycepin triphosphate, guanidine, deoxyguanidine, which were not found anywhere else in nature. Adenosine and Cordycepin (3\u2032-deoxyadenosine) are pharmaceutically active components exhibits multiple pharmacological actions such as immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant etc. Cordycepin was originally extracted from Cordyceps militaris.\nChen and Chu (1996) characterized cordycepin and 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) in an extract of CS (Chen & Chu, 1996). In a quality assessment study of CS, Li et al., 2006a, Li et al., 2006b determined the presence of cordycepin in CS by analytical methods like capillary electrophoresis, HPLC and also reported it as an active principle (Li et al., 2006a, Li et al., 2006b). Moreover, it is required to make sure the presence of cordycepin for authenticity of genuine CS. Several other analytical methods and identification techniques studied like RP-HPLC (Shiao et al., 1994, Yu et al., 2006a, Yu et al., 2006b), HPLC\u2013ESI-MS (Huang, Guo, Liang, & Chen, 2004), and HPLC-DAD (Jiang, Liu, Li, & Jin, 2008) have been used for the determination of cordycepin. Other than adenosine and cordycepin few other nucleosides and nucleobases were reported in water extract of stroma and caterpillar of CS like cytosine, uracil, cytidine, hypoxanthine, uridine, thymine, adenine, inosine, guanosine and thymidine (Yuan, Zhao, Wang, Kuang, & Liu, 2008).",

            "text": "In addition to above main components, CS also contains proteins, peptides, polyamines, all essential amino acids and some uncommon cyclic dipeptides, including cyclo-[Gly-Pro], cyclo-[Leu-Pro], cyclo-[Val-Pro], cyclo-[Ala-Leu], cyclo-[Ala-Val], and cyclo-[Thr-Leu]. Some of these are found to show potent anti-tumor, antiviral, and antibiotic activities. Cyclic dipeptides like cyclo-(Leu-Pro) and cyclo-(Phe-Pro) found to exhibit antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties against growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts (Rhee, 2004). A study reveals the inhibitory action of cyclic dipeptides (produced by bacterium) against aflotoxin production (Yan et al., 2004). The content of protein in dead larvae (29.1%), fruiting body (30.4%) and in fermented mycelia (14.8%) varies. Amino acid profile lists three major principle amino acid (glutamic acid, aspartic acid and arginine) in the larvae-fruiting body (Hsu et al., 2002). Cordymin, a peptide purified from the medicinal mushroom of CS exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities (Qian, Pan, & Guo, 2012). Hypotensive and vasorelaxant activities were contributed by protein constituents of CS (Chiou, Chang, Chou, & Chen, 2000). For the first time an anti-bacterial protein (CSAP) from cultured mycelia was purified and characterized by chromatography and SDS\u2013PAGE. The CSAP exhibits anti-microbial activity (60%) against Gram-positive and Gram negative bacteria and improved temperature stability but did not show haemagglutinating activity (Zheng et al., 2006). A new cyclodipeptide named as a Cordycedipeptide A and modified dipeptides named as Cordyceamides A and B, were isolated from the culture liquid of CS and structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR techniques. It is found to show cytotoxic activities towards L-929, A375, and Hela cells (Jia et al., 2009, Jing et al., 2005).",

In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) cells proliferation, inflammatory cytokines production, and genes expression were evaluated after treatment with CS MeOH extract. It showed suppressory effect (92.6% at 200 mg/ml) on BALF cells proliferation with stimulated with LPS. Further, CS-19-22 among 15 sub fractions, showed better activities: (1) suppressed BALF cells proliferation (dose dependent), (2) reduced the IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 production in LPS activated BALF cell cultures, (3) enhanced production of IL-12 and IFN-g production in activated BALF cells (Kuo et al., 2001).",

CS improved survival and inhibited anti-ds DNA antibody production in lupus mice (NZB/NZW F1) and also improved the defective IL-2 production (Chen et al., 1993). Liu, Lu, and Ji (1992) suggested that CS could be utilized as an approach of biological responsive modifier therapy (BRMT) in the treatment of leukemia. Similarly another study reported that CS could augment the NK cell activity and improves the CD16 marker expression on lymphocytes and the binding capacity to K562 cells (Liu et al., 1992). Further, acid polysaccharide fraction (APSF), from an anamorph of CS has stimulating activity on macrophages where increased expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and iNOS, and reduced the expression of IL-10 of Ana-1 cells were observed (Chen, Yuan, Wang, Song, & Zhang, 2012). On the other hand CS extract was found to enhance the MHC class II antigen expression on HA22T/VGH cells of human hepatoma cell line HA22T/VGH. Immunostaining of monoclonal antibody (MAb) L243 against the HLA DR region of MHC class II antigens was analyzed using cytofluorimetry where CS extract down regulated the MHC class II antigen expression making immune surveillance of host more effective against tumor cells (Chiu et al., 1998).",

Immunosuppressant effect of CS was demonstrated wherein CS showed inhibition effect for immune reaction viz. phagocytic function of peripheral blood leucocytes, mitogenic response of spleen lymphocytes to Con A, and mixed lymphocyte culture and LPS-induced IL-1 release of macrophages (Zhu & Yu, 1990). In another study the inhibitory effect of a CS preparation (CS-1) on the immune response responsible for the organ transplant rejection has been studied. Moreover, CS-1 can prolong the survival of grafted heart without causing infection, and it did not exert detrimental effects on vital organ (Zhang & Xia, 1990).",

Basically water or alcohol extracts contain polar compounds that contribute to anti-cancer effects. Similar anti-cancer effect of warm water extract of dried CS was studied, where Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC), allogeneic to ICR mice, Meth A fibrosarcoma (Meth A), syngeneic to BALB/c mice were used as the target tumor cell lines and reported that antitumor effect of extract may be mediated through its immunomodulating action (Yoshida et al., 1989). Nakamura et al. (1999) investigated the effect of the water extract of CS (WECS) on liver metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma (B16) cells in mice. In both LLC and B16 experiments, water extract showed strong cytotoxic effect, not because of cordycepin but just because of other components (Nakamura et al., 1999) and further, it was reported that cordycepin exerts inhibitory effect on the growth of mouse melanoma and lung carcinoma cells by stimulating adenosine A3 receptors on tumor cells (Nakamura et al., 2006). In recent studies, water extract from dried fruiting bodies of cultured CS, is evaluated for its anti-cancer effect, where cordycepin which is a effective ingradient in water extract and found to show anti-cancer effect on B16\u2013BL6 cells, LLC cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells and human colon carcinoma (CW-2) cells by stimulating adenosine A3 receptor (A3-R) (Yoshikawa et al., 2011) and which is also followed by Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3\u03b2 activation and Cyclin D1 suppression by using radioligand binding assay (Yoshikawa et al., 2008).",

They discovered that this effect may come from significant increased production of 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid and 17-ketosteriod levels (Hobbs, 1995). Guan et al. (1992) conducted a trial on 51 patients with chronic renal failure, which is a life-threatening condition that often affects the elderly. When these patients were given the drug (CS at 3\u20135 g/day), it showed significant improvement in kidney function (Guan et al., 1992). Sometimes kidneys failure is often linked to problems occurring in other organs and systems such as hypertension, proteinuria and anemia. A study involving subjects suffering from above said ailments, were treated with CS. CS decreased blood pressure (15%) after one month, significantly reduced urinary protein and increased superoxide dismutase enzymes. The study further suggests that an increase in the free radical-scavenging capability of oxygen in the bloodstream, which would result in reduced oxidative cellular damage. Further, 57 patients with gentamicin-induced kidney damage were treated with 4.5 g of Cordyceps per day.

Cordycepin in hot water extract of Cordyceps sinensis shows inhibitory actions by stimulating adenosine receptors in turn activates protein kinase C pathway which can be activated through DAG, PLC and Ca2+. This signaling pathway stimulates steroidogenesis which results in progesterone production that brings about anti-tumor effect. On other hand cordycepin induces cytotoxic stress signal to mitochondria activating caspase 9, 3.7 cascade pathway via apoptosomes. This cascade caspases pathway brings about DNA fragmentation, plasma blebbling which is characteristic of apoptosis (Adapted from: Huang et al., 2000, Huang et al., 2001, Jen et al., 2011, Leu et al., 2011, Pao et al., 2012, Yoshikawa et al., 2011).
