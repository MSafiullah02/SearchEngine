For each participant in both groups, we collected demographic data that included age and gender. We specifically looked for lower airway infections and wheezing/asthma in the past, with at least one clinical event related office visit or prescription in the 12 months prior to surgery. All the data in regard to medical history and inclusion/exclusion criteria were based on an inquiry of their medical records at the hospital and at their primary pediatrician's office. Physical examination included height, weight, and BMI. The size of tonsils was graded from 1+ to 4+ following direct inspection of the oropharynx,14 at their day of surgery by the same physician.

Another limitation is the sample size, and although the statistical differences are significant we believe that studies with larger number of subjects will reassure the field that this is not a \u201cby chance\u201d finding, but a real biological phenomenon that is important in the pathophysiology of OSA in childhood. Since we did not include assessment of the adenoids in this study, it is also a limitation since children may suffer from OSA due to adenoid hypertrophy.
