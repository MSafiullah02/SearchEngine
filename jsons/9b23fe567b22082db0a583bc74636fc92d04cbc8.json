Anti-Allergy vaccination also offers great potential for successful commercial exploitation. This often relies on allergen-specific immunotherapy (STI) (Palma-Carlos et al. 2006) , where a patient is administered increasing quantities of allergen to augment their natural tolerance. STI, though often effective, is very time consuming and is not universally applicable. Recombinant hypo-allergenic allergens are also of interest, as they can target specific immune cells. New agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of allergic disease are legion: recombinant proteins, peptides, immunomodulatory therapy, and DNA vaccines, which are particularly promising tools. Several anti-allergy DNA vaccines are being developed: including optimised expression of allergen genes, CpG-enrichment of delivery vectors, and the targeting of hypoallergenic DNA vaccines. Vaccines against the common cold or anti-allergy vaccines lie close to so-called life-style vaccines. None of these vaccines necessarily saves lives but does reduce hugely important economic effects of disease morbidity. Life-style vaccines target dental caries and drug addiction, as well as genetic and civilisation diseases, such as obesity.",

Gardasil, the new human papillomavirus vaccine (Hung et al. 2008) , was licensed in 2006 with the goal of saving 4,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer. Cancer is the second greatest cause of death in the developed world after cardiovascular disease; yet most of the 250,000 deaths from cervical cancer occur in the Third World. Cancer treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. While treating primary tumours this way is largely successful, preventing the metastatic spread of disease is not. Cancer vaccines are attractive, both clinically and commercially, since they exploit immunity's ability to recognise and destroy tumours. Tumour cells express several mutated or differentially expressed antigens, enabling the immune system to discriminate between non-malignant and cancerous cells. Tumour antigens form the basis of both subunit and epitope-based vaccines. Host immune system responses to tumour-antigen cancer vaccines are often weak, necessitating the use of adjuvants.",

Vaccinology has, until relatively recently, been a primarily empirical science, relying on tried-and-tested -yet poorly understood -approaches to vaccine development. As a consequence of this, few effective vaccines were developed and deployed during the 150 years following Jenner: most targets remained inaccessible to science to the emerging science of vaccinology. The success of a vaccine can be measured by its strength, its specificity, the duration of the immune response, and its capacity to create immunological memory. A vaccine is a molecular or supramolecular agent which can elicit specific protective immunity and ultimately mitigate the effect of subsequent infection. Vaccination is the use of a vaccine, in whatever form, to produce active prophylactic immunity in a host organism.",

They can be delivered into the host in many ways: as naked DNA vaccines, using live viral or bacterial vectors, and via antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells.

Immunomics is a solution to this dilemma. It is a post-genomic systems biology approach to immunology that explores mechanistic aspects of the immune system (De Groot 2006) . It subsumes immunoinformatics and computational vaccinology, combining several fields, including genomics, proteomics, immunology and clinical medicine. To date, a key focus of immunomics has been the development of algorithms for the design and discovery of new vaccines. Here we outline currently available techniques and software for vaccine discovery as well as examples of how such algorithms can be applied.

MHC Class I and Class II molecules form complexes with different types of peptide. The Class I molecule binds a peptide of 8-15 amino acids in length within a single closed groove. The peptide is secured largely through interactions with anchoring residues at the N-and C-termini of the peptide, while the central region is more flexible (Rammensee et al. 1999) . Class II peptides vary in length from 12 to 25 amino acids and are bound by the protrusion of peptide side chains into cavities within the groove and through a series of hydrogen bonds formed between the main chain peptide atoms and the side chains atoms of the MHC molecule (Jardetzky et al. 1996) .

These include motif-based systems, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Donnes and Elofsson 2002; Liu et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2006) , Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Noguchi et al. 2002) , QSAR analysis (Doytchinova et al. 2005) , and structure-based approaches (Davies et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2003; Wan et al. 2004 ). MHC-binding motifs are a straightforward and easily comprehended method of epitope detection, yet produce many false-positive and many false-negative results. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are machine learning algorithms based on statistical theory that seeks to separate data into two distinct classes (in this case binders and non-binders). HMMs are statistical models where the system being modelled is assumed to be a Markov process with unknown parameters. In an HMM, the internal state is not visible directly, but variables influenced by the state are. HMMs aim to determine the hidden parameters from observable ones. An HMM profile can be used to determine those sequences with 'binder-like' qualities. QSAR analysis techniques have been used to refine the peptide interactions with the MHC Class I groove by incrementally improving and optimising the individual residue-to-residue interactions within the binding groove. This has led to the design of so-called superbinders that minimise the entropic disruption in the groove and are therefore able to stabilise even disfavoured residues within so-called anchor positions. Finally, molecular dynamics has been used to quantify the energetic interactions between the MHC molecule and peptide for both Class I and Class II by analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the MHC-peptide complex.",

Those cells, within the primary repertoire whose antibodies convey antigen recognition, are selected for clonal expansion, an iterative process of directed hypermutation and antigen-mediated selection. This facilitates the rapid maturation of antigen-specific antibodies with a high affinity for a specific epitope. A B cell appropriate to deal with a specific infection is selected and cloned to deal with the primary infection, and a population of the B cell is then maintained in the body to combat secondary infection.

All antibodies contain two antigen-binding sites, composed of complementary determining (CDR) loops. The three CDR loops of the heavy and light chains form the 'paratope', the protein surface which binds to the antigen. The molecular surface that makes specific contact with the residues of the paratope is termed an 'epitope'. A B cell epitope can be an entire molecule or a region of a larger structure.

Another problem with B cell epitopes relates to the fact that they are commonly divided into two groups: continuous epitopes and discontinuous epitopes. Continuous epitopes correspond to short peptide fragments of a few amino acid residues that can be shown to cross-react with antibodies raised against the intact protein. Since the residues involved in antibody binding represent a continuous segment of the primary sequence of the protein they are also referred to as 'linear' or 'sequential' epitopes. Studies have shown that this class of epitope often contains residues that are not implicated in antibody interaction, while some residues play a more important role than others in antibody binding. Discontinuous epitopes are composed of amino acid residues that are not sequential in the primary sequence of a protein antigen but brought into spatial proximity by the three-dimensional folding of the peptide chain (Greenbaum et al. 2007 ).",

It is partly for this reason that B Cell epitope has lagged far behind T Cell prediction in terms of accuracy but also because most of the data upon which predictions are based remain open to question due to the poorly understood recognition properties of crossreactive antibodies. One of the central problems with B cell epitope prediction is that the epitopes themselves are entirely context dependent. The surface of a protein is, by definition, a continuous landscape of potential epitopes that is without borders. Therefore both epitope and paratope are fuzzy recognition sites, forming not a single arrangement of specific amino acids but a series of alternative conformations. In this instance, a binary classification of binder and non-binder may simply not reflect the nature of the interaction. A factor also to be considered is that the average paratope consists of only a third of the residues within the CDR loops, suggesting the remaining two-thirds could potentially bind to an antigen with an entirely different protein surface.",

It is estimated that approximately 10% of epitopes on a globular protein antigen are truly continuous in nature. In spite of the this, the majority of research into B cell epitope prediction has focussed largely on linear peptides on the grounds that they are discrete sequences and easier to analyse.

More sophisticated machine learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks have also been applied but never with an accuracy exceeding 60%. More recently, structural analysis of known antigens has been used to determine the surface accessibility of residues as a measure of the probability that they are part of an epitope site. Despite these fundamental limitations, several B Cell epitope prediction programs are available including Discotope (Andersen et al. 2006) , 3DEX (Schreiber et al. 2005) and CEP (Kulkarni-Kale et al. 2005) . Both CEP and Discotope measure the surface accessibility of residues although neither has been developed to the point where they can identify coherent epitope regions rather than individual residues. A recent review of B cell epitope software (Ponomarenko and Bourne 2007) calculated the A ROC curves for the evaluated methods were about 0.6 (indicating 60% accuracy) for DiscoTope, ConSurf (which identifies functional regions in proteins), and PPI-PRED (protein-protein interface analysis) methods, while protein-protein docking methods were in the region of 65% accuracy, never exceeding 70%. The remaining prediction methods assessed were all close to random. In spite of this, the increasing number of available antigen-antibody structures combined with sophisticated techniques for structural analysis suggests a more methodical approach to the study interface will yield a better understanding of what surfaces can and cannot form stable epitopes. The proposed research will take several different approaches to this problem that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of antibody-antigen interactions.",

It begins with the prediction of subcellular localisation, followed by the calculation of probability of the protein being adhesion, the identification of TM domains, a comparison with the human proteome and then with that of the selected pathogen, after which the protein is assigned a putative function. The vaccine candidates are then filtered and ranked based upon these calculations. While it is generally accepted that determining ORFs is a relatively straightforward process, the algorithm used to define extracellular proteins from other proteins needs to be carefully selected. One of the most effective programs that can be used for this purpose is HensBC, a recursive algorithm for predicting the subcellular location of proteins. The program constructs a hierarchical ensemble of classifiers by applying a series of if-then rules. HensBC is able to assign proteins to one of four different types (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, or extracellular) with approximately 80% accuracy for Gram-negative bacterial proteins. The algorithm is non-specialised and can be applied to any genome. Any protein identified as being extracellular could be a potential vaccine candidate.",

Out of the 570 proteins that were identified, 350 could be successfully expressed in vitro and 85 of these were determined to be surface exposed. Seven identified proteins conferred immunity over a broad range of strains within the natural N. meningitidis population, demonstrating the viability of in silico analysis as an aid to finding candidates for the clinical development of a MenB vaccine. Another example of the successful application of reverse vaccinology is Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media in young children (Wizemann et al. 2001; Maione et al. 2005) . Mining of the genome identified 130 potential ORFs with significant homology to other bacterial surface proteins and virulence factors. 108 of 130 ORFs were successfully expressed and purified; six proteins were found to induce protective antibodies against pneumococcal challenge in a mouse sepsis model. All six of these candidates showed a high degree of cross-reactivity against the majority of capsular antigens expressed in vivo and which are believed to be immunogenic in humans.",

This generated 120 unique proteins sequences, 40 of which were shown to be positive for at least one of the sera. These were used to vaccinate mice, with only two of the antigens demonstrating significant protection. Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium associated with respiratory infections, cardiovascular and atherosclerotic disease. 141 ORFS were selected through in silico analysis (Montigiani et al. 2002) and 53 putative surface-exposed proteins identified. If reverse vaccinology is applied appropriately in vaccine design, it can save enormous amounts of money, time, and wasted labour.",

Viral delivery of genes has effectively targeted inter alia haemophilia, coronary heart disease, muscular dystrophy, arthritis, and cancer. Despite their immanent capacity to transfer genes into cells, concerns over safety, manufacturing, restricted targeting ability and plasmid size have limited deployment of effective and generic gene therapy approaches. This remains a key objective for vaccinology. Vectors for gene therapy and vaccines differ in their requirements, yet both must overcome issues of targeting, plasmid cargo, and adverse immunogenicity. For example, up to 10% of the vaccinia genome can be replaced by DNA coding for antigens from other pathogens. The resulting vector generates strong antibody and T cell responses, and is protective. Viruses commonly used as vectors include Poxviruses, Adeno, varicella, polio, and influenza. Bacterial vectors include both Mycobacterium bovis and Salmonella. Adding extra DNA coding for large molecule adjuvants greatly can exacerbate antibody or T cell responses.",

            "text": "Successful transfection is hampered by DNA degradation within and outside the cell, inadequate cell penetration, poor intracellular trafficking, and inefficient nuclear localisation. Gene delivery requires both vector escape from digestion in late endosomes and nuclear translocation. Caveolin-dependent endocytosis, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis do not transfer of material to the endo-lysosomal pathway. Some internalised material is released into the cytosol, through unknown mechanisms. However creating vectors with such desirable properties is difficult and their effectiveness may be compromised by their capacity to down-regulate other immune responses. The efficient and rational design of effective vaccine vectors is an area where informatic techniques could play a large role. Similar to, yet simpler than, viral vectors are so-called DNA vaccines; they are plasmids capable of expressing antigenic peptide within the host (Babiuk et al. 2000) . They are an attractive alternative to conventional vaccines, generating both a cellular and a humoral immune response, which are effective versus intracellular pathogens. The efficiency of a DNA vaccine has been successfully enhanced using codon optimisation (Babiuk et al. 2003) , CpG motif engineering (Uchijima et al. 1998) , (Klinman et al. 1997) , and the introduction of promoter sequences (Booth et al. 2007) , (Lee et al. 1997) . Codon optimisation has been most effective in enhancing protein expression efficiency. Codons optimal for Translation are those recognised by abundant tRNAs (Xu et al. 2001) . Within a phylogenetic group, codon frequency is highly correlated with gene expression levels. Immunogenicity depends upon effective translation and transcription of the antigen; it is possible to enhance this by selecting optimal codons for the vaccine.",

Adjuvants are defined as any chemical which is able to enhance an immune response when applied simultaneously with a vaccine and thus improve the efficacy of vaccination (Harish et al. 2006 ); Singh and O'Hagan 2002. It is possible that some adjuvants act as immune potentiators, triggering an early innate immune response that enhances the vaccine effectiveness by increasing the vaccine uptake. Adjuvants may also enhance vaccination by improving the depot effect, the co-localisation of the antigen, and immune potentiators by delaying the spread of the antigen from the site of infection so that absorption occurs over a prolonged period (Stills 2005) . Aluminium hydroxide or Alum is the only adjuvant currently licensed in humans. Aluminium-based adjuvants prolong antigen persistence due to the depot effect, as well as stimulating the production of IgG1 and IgE antibodies (Gupta 1998 ) and triggering the secretion of interleukin-4. There are also several small-molecule, drug-like adjuvants, such as imiquimod, resiquimod, and other imidazoquinolines (Singh and Srivastava 2003; Schijns 2003; Iellem et al. 2001 ). Other small molecules that have been investigated for adjuvant properties include Monophosphoryl-Lipid A, muramyl dipeptide, QS21, PLG, and Seppic ISA-51 (Schijns 2003) . In many cases, the adjuvant molecules have displayed toxic properties or showed poor adsorption making them unsuitable for use. Thus there is a great demand for new compounds that can be used as adjuvants.",

GPCRs are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins responsible for the transduction of a variety of endogenous extracellular signals into an intracellular response (Locati and Murphy 1999; Christopoulos and Kenakin 2002; Gether et al. 2002) . Activation of the chemokine receptors triggers an inflammatory response by inducing migration of the leukocytes from circulation to the site of injury or infection. The receptors play a pivotal role in angiogenesis, haematopoiesis, brain and heart development, and there is also evidence that CCR5 precipitates the entry of HIV-1 into CD4+ T cells by the binding of the viral envelope protein gp120 (Bissantz 2003; Deng et al. 1996) . There are 18 chemokine receptors and over 45 known chemokine ligands. The chemokines can be divided into the CC and CXC family, the former contains two cysteine residues adjacent within the protein sequence while in the latter they are separated by a single amino acid. CCR4 is a chemokine receptor expressed on Th2-type CD4+ T cells and has been linked to allergic inflammation diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. There are two chemokines which bind the CCR4 receptor exclusively, CCL22 and CCL17 (Feng et al. 1996) . Inhibition of the two ligands has been shown to reduce the migration of T cells to sites of inflammation, suggesting than any CCR4 antagonist could provide an effective treatment for allergic reactions, specifically in the treatment of asthma. Both anti-CCL17 and anti-CCL22 antibodies have been observed to have efficacy, the property that enables a molecule to impart a pharmacological response, in murine asthma models.",

The Tregs inhibit dendritic cell maturation and thus downregulate expression of the co-stimulatory molecule. A successful CCR4 antagonist would therefore be able to enhance human T cell proliferation in an in vitro immune response model by blocking the Treg proliferation. This suggests that an effective CCR4 antagonist would have the properties of an adjuvant. A combination of virtual screening and experimental validation has been used to identify several potential adjuvants capable of inhibiting the proliferation of Tregs. Small-molecule adjuvant discovery is amenable to techniques used routinely by the pharmaceutical industry. Three-dimensional virtual screening is a fast and effective way of identifying molecules by docking a succession of ligands into a defined binding site (Lieberam and Forster 1999) . A large database of small molecules can be screened quickly and efficiently in this way. Using 'targeted' libraries containing a specific subset of molecules is often more effective. It is possible to use 'privileged fragments' to construct combinatorial libraries, those which are expected to have increased probability of success. A pharmacophore is a specific three-dimensional map of biological properties common to all active confirmations of a set of ligands exhibiting a particular activity that can be used to discover new molecules with similar properties. Several small molecules that have been investigated for adjuvant properties in this way (Schellhammer and Rarey 2004) . More recently, molecules that selectively interfere with chemokine-mediated T Cell migration have shown the potential to act as adjuvants by down-regulating the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, limiting T Cell activation. Small-molecule chemokine receptor antagonists have been identified and shown to be effective at blocking chemokine function in vivo (Charoenvit et al. 2004b; Godessart 2005) , although to date no compound has reached a phase II clinical trial.",

Conversely, cancer and heart disease were responsible for only 12%. Compare that to the final 25 years of the seventeenth century, when average life expectancy was below 40. Principal causes of death were again infectious disease: smallpox, tuberculosis, malaria, yellow fever, and dysentery, which affected adult and children alike. Seemingly little had changed in the intervening 150 years. Today, the picture is very different, at least in developed countries. Infectious disease accounts for below 2% of deaths. Chronic disease now account for over 60% of deaths in the First World.",

Obviously, a few great epidemic diseasesprincipally the Black Death -have, on occasion, made not insignificant dents in this inexorable upward progression. Citizens of the Roman Empire enjoyed a mean life expectancy at birth of about 22 years. By the Middle Ages, this had, in Europe at least, increased to be about 33 years. By the middle of the nineteenth century general life expectancy had risen to roughly 43 years. In the early 1900s, mean life spans in more developed countries ranged from 35 to 55. Life expectancy has accelerated over the last hundred years or so and today over 40 countries have an average life expectancy exceeding 70 years. The average life span across the whole human population is somewhat lower, however; it is estimated at 64.8 years -63.2 years for men and 66.47 years for women.",

However, this so-called ageing is only comparative, and comparative to the past. In fact, around 27% of the global population are aged 14 or under; of this, 0.91 billion are male and 0.87 billion are female. Only an estimated 100 million children attend school. The gender imbalance also varies across the world. In Hennan province, the most populous region of China, the balance is skewed 118:100 in favour of boys, probably due to the elective abortion of female foetuses; the average in industrialised nations of the First World is 103-108:100.

Worldwide, only 7.4% of people are actually 65 and over, with a balance of men to women of 0.21-0.27 billion. However, when compared to centuries past, this shift is remarkable; one might almost call it a lurch, it has been so rapid. One way in which this shift manifests itself is in the vastly increased longevity of the individual, as well as an increasing proportion of the population reaching old age. This phenomenon is, in part, a by product of the First World's ever more comfortable, ever more urbanised post-industrial environment. Coupled to decades of better nutrition, medical advances in both treatment regimes and medicines will allow an everincreasing section of the population to exploit their own genetic predisposition to long life. In North America, it has been estimated that by the middle of the century, those living beyond the age 100 would number over 100,000. On this basis, some have predicted that the human life span will be routinely stretched to 120. However, the total global population of so-called super-centenarianthose living beyond 110 -is roughly 80; while only one in two billion will live beyond 116.",

The potential -albeit largely unrealised -is huge, but only if people are willing to take up the technology and use it appropriately. People's expectations of computational work are often largely unrealistic and highly tendentious. Some expect perfection, and are soon disappointed, rapidly becoming vehement critics. Others are highly critical from the start and are nearly impossible to reconcile with informatic methods. Neither appraisal is correct, however. Informatic methods do not replace, or even seek to replace, experimental work, only to help rationalise experiments, saving time and effort. They are slaves to the data used to generate them. They require a degree of intellectual effort equivalent in scale yet different in kind to that of so-called experimental science. The two disciplines -experimental and informatics -are thus complementary albeit distinct.",
