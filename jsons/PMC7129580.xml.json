Despite possible positivity for urinary pneumococcal antigen owing to asymptomatic carriage, some paediatricians still preferred using it as a screening tool, because Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common pneumonia pathogen in children <5 years old. For possible M. pneumoniae co-infection, we considered three situations as positive results (summarized in the Supplementary material, Data S1). Clinical laboratory data on admission and peak or nadir values during hospitalization were collected. White blood cell count >15 000/\u03bcL was defined as leucocytosis but a count of <5000/\u03bcL was defined as leucopenia. Platelet count >450 000/\u03bcL was defined as thrombocytosis and <150 000/\u03bcL as thrombocytopenia.

Seven (9.3%) of the 75 LRTI cases eventually developed respiratory failure and required intubation, with three cases (43%) having underlying diseases.

In multivariate analysis, underlying diseases, fever >7 days, leucopenia, antibiotic prescription and HAdV-7 infection were all independently associated with the risk of LRTI (see Supplementary material, Table S5). All 75 patients with LRTI had blood samples sent for bacterial culture and three samples yielded positive results (all coagulase-negative staphylococcus). Urine samples were collected for 38 cases. Bacterial cultures showed only one positive result, which was for Escherichia coli in the HAdV-7 group. Thirty-six cases were tested for M. pneumoniae co-infection, with most (63.9%) aged >3 years.

This might explain the underestimated rate of co-infection; however, our findings might reflect a community outbreak of HAdV, whereas most cases admitted to the hospital were due to more severe clinical presentations. Notably, none of our cases involved a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.
