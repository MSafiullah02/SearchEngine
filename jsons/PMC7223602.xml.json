            "text": "The man, who was a smoker and had diabetes mellitus, presented to emergency department with dyspnoea, cough, fever and left hemiparesis for 2 days. He was subsequently diagnosed with influenza A virus infection. Brain MRI revealed acute infarctions scattered in the right frontal lobes, basal ganglia and parietal lobes. He received oxygen via a nasal prolong at presentation. Five hours following admission, he required invasive mechanical ventilation due to progressive hypoxaemia. Following intubation, CT scan of his chest revealed focal centrilobular nodules with linear branching opacities and confluent nodular consolidation in the bilateral lungs and partially filled materials in the bilateral bronchial lumens. Therefore, he was admitted to the neurologic ICU, where he received clopidogrel and aspirin for management of cerebral infarction, as well as a single-dose of peramivir 600mg and broad-spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam). Despite this treatment, continuous bloody discharge through the endotracheal tube was seen. Hence, fiber optic bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day 2, that revealed diffuse tracheobronchitis with haemorrhagic and necrotic materials partially obstructing the trachea and both bronchi. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was identified from the bronchial washing sample, and tests for all other micro-organisms were negative. Biopsy of the right main bronchus revealed necrotising inflammation, which was considered life threatening in this patient. He therefore started receiving oseltamivir 75mg twice a day for extended therapy. However, the bloody discharge through the endotracheal tube continued. On day 6, he developed cardiac arrest due to airway obstruction. Spontaneous circulation returned after 6 cycles of CPR. Following recovery from the cardiac arrest, a CT scan revealed a large amount of materials in the endo-tracheobronchial lumen without changes in infiltration in the bilateral lungs. After the cardiac arrest, the mechanical ventilator showed low plateau pressure and high peak pressure. He died on day 10 due to progression to multiple organ failure after cardiac arrest.",
