In recent years new metal complexes have been identified as a very promising class of anticancer active compounds [6], [7], [8]. Metals bound to atoms such as N, O and S can form a chelate ring that binds the metal more tightly when compared to the non-chelate form. Large biological molecules (proteins, enzymes, DNA etc.) are electron-rich but metal ions are electron-deficient. Therefore, interactions occur between metal ions and many important biological molecules. This event has led to the use of metals or metal-containing agents to modulate biological systems [9]. Organometallic compounds have gained importance as enzyme inhibitors due to the capability of binding large biological molecules more strongly than metal-free organic compounds [10].",

The other property of metals is to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species [11]. The anticancer potential of metal containing agents, from main group elements to early transition metals, have been evaluated [12], [13], [14]. Especially organo-platinum compounds such as cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are metal-based drugs that are among the most active and widely used clinical drugs in cancer chemotherapy [15], [16], [17]. These platinum complexes react in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA which finally activates programmed cell death [18]. However, the clinical utility of these drugs is limited to a relatively narrow range of tumors (sarcomas, small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphomas and germ cell tumors) because of primary resistance and the development of resistance secondary to the initial treatment [19], [20]. Therefore, unconventional platinum complexes, that could be used in cisplatin-resistant tumors are made by different research groups [21], [22], [23], [24].",

[35], [40], [41], [42]. The chemical structures of the ligands are given in Scheme 1\n. All thiosemicarbazone derivatives synthesized were characterized by UV\u2013Vis, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS spectral data and elemental analysis.",

The thiosemicarbazones can exhibit thione-thiol tautomerism in solution because of the thioamide (NH\u2013CS) function. The \u03bd(SH) band at ca. The 2500\u20132600 cm\u22121 region is absent from the IR spectra of the ligands but the v(NH) band at 3115\u20133140 cm\u22121 and the strong band due to v(CS) at 783\u2013825 cm\u22121 are present, suggesting that in the solid phase the thiosemicarbazones remain as the thione form [45]. These bands are shifted to lower wavenumbers (13\u201366 cm\u22121) indicating the coordination of metal through thione/thiol sulfur in all complexes. This coordination is approved by the presence of two new bands at the 502\u2013521 and 400\u2013418 cm\u22121 region due to v(Pt\u2013N, Pd\u2013N and Pt\u2013S, Pd\u2013S), respectively [46]. The band due to v(C\u2013S\u2013C) of the thiophene ring remains unaltered in complexes (1a\u20135a and 1b\u20135b), indicating non-participation of the thiophene ring in coordination. The azomethine stretching vibrations \u03bd(CN), characteristic of a Schiff base are observed at 1582\u20131595 cm\u22121\n[7]. The negative shift (30\u201378 cm\u22121) of the CN band was observed in all complexes which exhibit the involvement of azomethine nitrogen upon complexation. On the other hand, the shift to higher wavenumbers of the v(N\u2013N) band, observed for the platinum and palladium complexes, have also been related to the electronic delocalization and occurred as a consequence of coordination through the azomethine nitrogen atom and deprotonation of thiosemicarbazones [47]. Finally, the ligands 1\u20135 coordinate to platinum(II) and palladium(II) as NS bidentate.",

The second step starts after the first step and continues until complete decomposition of the ligands and formation of MS [where, M = Pd(II) and Pt(II)]. The total weight loss of all complexes depends on the loss of the respective ligand, after one sulfur atom moving to the metal ion and residues conversion to the palladium sulfide and platinum sulfide.",

Unfortunately, none of the compounds tested were endowed with appreciable inhibitory activity at subtoxic concentrations except for compound 1b that showed the highest antiviral activity against HCMV (EC50: 2.9\u201315.3 \u03bcM). By comparison of the ganciclovir potency against HCMV we can conclude that 1b was 3-fold less active against HCMV AD-169 strain and almost equally potent against Davis strain as ganciclovir (EC50: 5.0 \u03bcM for AD-169 strain, EC50: 3.4 \u03bcM for Davis strain). However, it should be mentioned that this compound was also cytostatic at CC50 value of 13.3 \u03bcM in HEL cell cultures. Therefore, the observed anti-HCMV activity may well be due to an indirect cytostatic activity of the compounds rather than a specific antiviral activity. No specific antiviral effect was noted for any compounds evaluated against other viruses (data not given).",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, 4, \u2026 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105 cells/cm3) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically. Antiviral activity was expressed as the concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (EC50).",
