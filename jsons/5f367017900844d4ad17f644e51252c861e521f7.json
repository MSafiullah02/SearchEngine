Yet, the very conditions that make these regions challenging to study -9 extreme environmental conditions and low population density for various organisms -also make 10 them potentially untapped natural laboratories for examining eco-evolutionary relationships 11 between hosts and parasites. Adaptations and ecological patterns illustrated by desert parasite 12 communities can serve as exemplars within the extremes regarding the evolution of virulence, 13 breadth of host spectra, and lifecycle strategies. This review provides relevant examples for each 14 of these three topics using parasites from dryland regions in order to encourage future empirical 15 tests of hypotheses regarding parasite ecology and evolution within dryland ecosystems and 16 stimulate wider investigation into the parasitofauna of arid regions in general. As global climate 17 changes and anthropogenic disturbance increases, desertification is a growing problem which has 18 been labeled as a threat to global health. Thus, deserts not only provide useful natural 19 laboratories in which to study parasite transmission but understanding parasite transmission 20 within these habitats becomes increasingly important as larger, likely highly resource insecure, 21 populations are projected to live on the margins of desert regions in the future.",

Additionally, as a whole, drylands are home to approximately 50 35.5% of the world's population and hold a share of 65% of the planet's rangelands as well as 51 25% of its cultivated lands (Safriel et al. 2007 ). Thus, from both a habitat and a land use 52 perspective, drylands are critical areas for assessing the interface between humans and nature. 53 Drylands themselves consist of three major types of habitat ( Fig. 1) : forests within dry subhumid 54 areas (aridity index = 0.50-0.65), grasslands within semiarid areas (aridity index = 0.20-0.50), 55 and deserts within arid (aridity index = 0.05 -0.20) as well as hyper-arid (aridity index < 0.05) 56 areas, with deserts accounting for slightly over 17% of the Earth's surface (Safriel et al. 2007 ). 57 Despite the significant extent of drylands on earth, these areas are understudied (Trimble 58 and van Aarde 2012). This could be due to preconceived perceptions of arid environments and 59 that working in them can be logistically challenging, as precarious environmental conditions, 60 limited resources, and remote locations can make research in deserts difficult. Additionally, 61 deserts occupy well over 5 times the land area of developing nations as compared to 62 industrialized ones, possibly making them an afterthought to researchers in typical Western 63 industrialized countries (Safriel et al. 2007 ). Unfortunately, deserts might also have been 64 ecological afterthoughts in the past, with less motivation for studying desert communities than, 65 for example, temperate forest communities. Desert ecosystems have historically been considered 66 to be of little complexity given that their aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is low, 67 typically three times lower than temperate forest ecosystem ANPP (Webb et al. 1978, Hadley 68 and Szarek 1981, Garcia-Pichel and Belnap 1996); therefore, these communities might not be 69 given the full consideration by ecologists that they deserve.

            "text": "Two barriers to parasite transmission in deserts are immediately apparent: 1) low host 79 density (e.g. Munger et al. 1983 , Polis 1991 , Krecek et al. 1995 , and 2) harsh abiotic conditions 80 (e.g. Dobson 1989). Thus, the contact rate between infective stages and potential hosts becomes 81 increasingly small as: 1) low host density means that the likelihood of host to host or host to 82 vector decreases, and 2) survival of infective stages in the environment likewise decreases as 83 abiotic conditions become increasingly inhospitable. However, given these two sets of 84 conditions, deserts can act as a type of natural laboratory in which to gather test predictions 85 related to key aspects of parasite transmission. As reviewed by Dobson (1989) , transmission can 86 be considered a \"birth\" in the ecological sense as it represents parasite recruitment while 87 virulence can similarly be considered a source of mortality. The basic reproductive rate (R 0 ) of a 88 parasite, or any pathogen, represents its reproductive success and is directly influenced by the 89 rate of new infections, the mortality rate of infected hosts, and the mortality rate of infective 90 stages (Box 1). Thus, the means by which a parasite can increase its reproductive success are to: 91 1) increase transmission rate, 2) decrease host mortality rate, or 3) decrease the mortality rate of 92 infective stages. Given that host density is low in deserts and their harsh abiotic conditions make However, the availability of susceptible hosts can greatly modify optimal virulence levels in eco-107 evolutionary models. This is because as the number of susceptible hosts in the population 108 increases, parasite fitness increases due to increased infectiousness; however, the fitness cost of One approach to improve empirical support for virulence predictions is to take advantage breadth hypothesis postulates that this pattern is due, at least in part, to interspecific variation in 186 niche breadth; thus, a species that can exploit a variety of habitats and resources can attain a 187 broad distribution and high local density (Brown 1984 (Brown , 1995 . short, this monogenean uses seasonal host mating aggregations to increase its likelihood of 232 success (Tinsley 1990 ). The life cycle of P. americanus is unique among helminths in that the 233 larvae, which infect the host via its nares, migrate to the bladder where adults mature and start 234 producing offspring that are retained in utero until the next rainy season (Tinsley and Earle 235 1983). Indeed, P. americanus can release its entire annual reproductive output within a seven-236 hour period that corresponds to host spawning (Tinsley 1990 ). Male toads, which typically enter 237 multiple spawning assemblies, exhibit nearly 100% prevalence and a mean intensity of over 100 However, since small lizards that do not exclusively feed on termites can also host these 277 encysted juveniles (Jones 1995), upward incorporation seems a logical scenario in this case.

For example, only approximately two 29 investigations per million km 2 of desert have been published as compared to 25 publications per 30 million km 2 of temperate forest between 1984 and 2010 (Trimble and van Aarde 2012). Given 31 that free-living desert communities are understudied relative to those in other ecosystems, it 32 follows that their corresponding parasitofauna (sensu stricto = eukaryotic parasites) has been 33 understudied as well. This is unfortunate because the unique challenges that these organisms face 34 in arid habitats can provide greater understanding of eco-evolutionary relationships between 35 hosts and parasites in general. Most notably, parasite transmission within deserts faces the two 36 vital challenges of low host density and harsh abiotic conditions. Thus, corresponding 37 adaptations and ecological patterns illustrated by desert parasite communities can serve as 38 exemplars within the extremes regarding the evolution of virulence, breadth of host spectra, and 39 lifecycle strategies. Additionally, as global climate changes and anthropogenic disturbances 40 increase, desertification is a growing problem that has been labeled as a threat to global health 41 (Kuehn 2006, Patz et al. 2012). Thus, deserts not only provide useful natural laboratories in 42 which to study parasite transmission, understanding parasite transmission within these habitats 43 becomes increasingly important as larger, likely highly resource insecure, populations are 44 projected to live on the margins of desert regions in the future (Kuehn 2006, Safriel et al. 2007, 45 Patz et al. 2012).",

Thus, the availability of various wild reservoir 147 hosts are higher in areas where Leishmania species causing VL are distributed and likely 148 evolved. Additionally, growing levels of urbanization in some habitats have increased the 149 availability and/or proximity of reservoir hosts, especially synanthropic ones like dogs 150 (Wasserberg et al. 2003, Diniz 2008, Ahmad 2020, Salah et al. 2020). Unfortunately, broad 151 surveys of the effects of Leishmania spp. on its sylvatic reservoirs are limited. Dobson (1989) 152 suggested that CL had little obvious impact on sylvatic reservoirs but only provided a qualitative 153 assessment. A survey of VL effects on wildlife hosts indicates that they could serve as important 154 reservoirs of human VL infection (Souza et al. 2014) while proximity to domestic and wild 155 animals has been indicated as an risk factor for both CL and VL (Valero and Uriarte 2020). 156 Several surveys suggest that dogs are important reservoirs of leishmaniasis (Singh et al. 2010, 157 Dantas-Torres et al. 2012, Maia et al. 2015). However, domestic dogs are: 1) not necessarily the 158 host with which these parasites coevolved, 2) have population densities that are positively 159 correlated with human population densities, and 3) can be highly competent reservoir hosts when 160 they are asymptomatic (Laurenti et al. 2013); thus, virulence in domestic dogs might not be a 161 good proxy for virulence in sylvatic reservoirs. Yet, it is worth noting that understanding how 162 8 growing numbers of competent reservoirs, such as domestic dogs, might change the virulence of 163 endemic Leishmania spp. could be a key step toward protecting public health in the future. 164 Therefore, taking a comparative approach toward uncovering how virulence evolved in arid 165 versus non-arid environments could provide empirical tests of models developed at different 166 population densities for various parasites.",

Broad structural host specificity, or the ability to 171 achieve high relative abundance on or in multiple host species, acts as a key hedge against local 172 parasite extinction (Poulin et al. 2011). Indeed, exploiting several different host species at a 173 similar level of abundance allows parasites to resist perturbations to local host populations that 174 result in low numbers of hosts in a given area; however, the ability to switch hosts could also be 175 constrained by the level of phylogenetic relatedness within the potential host community 176 (Krasnov et al. 2004a,b). Learning how parasites evolve as generalists versus specialists and the 177 phenomenon of host switching can help elucidate the processes that underlie novel host-parasite 178 associations.

Indeed, a meta-analysis that analyzed the relationship between190 flea abundance and host specificity on small mammals across arid and semi-arid habitats found 191 that the host spectrum became broader as flea abundance increased (Krasnov et al. 2004a). This 192 was due to either to fleas increasing either the number of host species they exploited or the 193 average taxonomic distance among those host species. The authors then posited that these 194 generalist parasites achieve higher abundance because of greater resource availability (i.e. more 195 hosts to infest), greater resource stability (i.e. number of hosts is relatively constant regardless of 196 local perturbations), or a combination of both (Krasnov et al. 2004a). Additionally, in an 197 experimental test of two fleas infesting desert rodents, generalist fleas Xenopsylla ramesis reared 198 on taxonomically distant hosts exhibited less morphological asymmetry of leg length, meaning 199 that their left and right legs closely matched in length. However, specialist fleas Parapulex 200 chaephrenis, exhibited significantly higher leg asymmetry when reared on taxonomically distant 201 hosts (Warburton et al. 2017). Morphological asymmetry is a key marker of low developmental 202 stability or a decrease in the ability to produce a given phenotype in a given environment (Palmer 203 1994). These results indicate that generalist fleas have greater developmental stability than 204 specialist ones when reared on less-than-suitable hosts (Warburton et al. 2017).

Some parasites, such as nematodes and 211 trematodes, have evolved complex lifecycles that include immature stages outside the host.212These stages can take a sit-and-wait mode of transmission or a more active one. For example, the213 egg of Ascaris suum, a common geohelminth in temperate and tropical areas worldwide, can 214 remain infective in soil for many months awaiting ingestion by a host; however, this is only the 215 case when temperature and humidity are suitable (Roepsteroff et al. 2001). Many trematodes in 216 temperate and tropical areas, such as Echinostoma caproni, utilize free-living miracidal and 217 cercarial stages that actively seek out and penetrate a host (Fried and Graczyk 1997). However, 218 these stages require some type of environmental water (e.g. dew, water body) which is highly 219 ephemeral in arid regions. Thus, parasite transmission via extra-host stages is challenging in 220 deserts. However, two solutions have evolved that not only meet challenging abiotic conditions 221 but also provide a work around for low host density, namely: 1) tight synchronization between 222 parasite lifecycles and host phenology (e.g. seasonal host aggregation), and 2) utilizing 223 intermediate hosts as both a buffer to external environmental conditions and as a vector that can 224 increase host contact rate. 225 One of the most well-known examples of tight synchronization between the lifecycle of a 226 parasite species and the phenology of a host species, the monogenean trematode 227 Pseudodiplorchis americanus and the Spadefoot Toad (Scaphiopus couchii), occurs in the desert 228 of southeastern Arizona (USA). These toads spend the vast majority of their life in estivation and 229 are only active for approximately 8 weeks of the year, during the \"monsoons\" of June and July; 230 thus, although the transmission window of their only major parasite (P. americanus) is very 231",

Thus, even though the window of potential transmission totals less than 24 hours per year, 240 P.americanus has been able to exploit the toad's mating behavior to concentrate in one place,241 allowing for maximum likelihood of transmission. (Tinsely and Jackson 1988). Like most desert 242 fauna, the relationship between S. couchii and P.americanus represents an extreme; however, 243 little investigation into the triggers between parasite life cycle and host phenology exist beyond 244 it. Examining additional host-parasite relationships within drylands and other extreme 245 environments could help elucidate both proximate and ultimate drivers of this aspect of parasite 246 lifecycle evolution. 247 Another strategy to guard against harsh environmental conditions and low host density is 248 to include a motile vector into the lifecycle. Thus, the use of invertebrates as intermediate hosts 249 and vectors provides not only a stable environment in which immature parasite stages can 250 develop but also increase the likelihood of encountering a suitable definitive host. For instance, 251 high food web connectivity and complex arthropod faunas within deserts (Polis 1991) make 252 incorporating trophic transmission via invertebrate intermediates evolutionarily advantageous to 253 parasites in arid regions. Parker et al. (2003) detail two alternatives for the insertion of a new 254 12 host into a parasite lifecycle. Upward incorporation involves adding a new definitive host that is 255 usually a predator of the original definitive host while the original host typically becomes an 256 intermediate host allowing for the parasite to avoid mortality due this predation (Parker et al. 257 2003). Alternatively, a new intermediate host is added at a lower trophic level during downward 258 incorporation. Adding this intermediate host decreases the mortality of infective propagules in 259 the environment and increases the likelihood of transmission to the original definitive host 260 (Parker et al. 2003). 261 Although the conditions in which these alternatives might evolve are dissimilar, the final 262 products of the two -a parasite lifecycle utilizing both an intermediate and definitive host -are 263 typically indistinguishable. However, given the high potential mortality of infective propagules 264 in an extreme environment and the effects of low host density on parasite transmission, deserts 265 could provide empirical evidence to test the conditions of downward incorporation into parasite 266 lifecycle evolution. Likewise, given high food web connectivity within deserts (Polis 1991), they 267 can also be an ideal environment in which to investigate upward incorporation. Consider, for 268 example, the life cycle of nematodes belonging to superfamily Physalopteroidea that parasitize 269 various lizard species in Australia's Great Victoria Desert. Jones (1995) found that many small 270 lizard species that feed exclusively on termites, like geckos Diplodactylus conspicillatus, were 271 also host to encysted juvenile physalopteriodeans; however, the corresponding adults parasitize 272 larger lizards, such as those belonging to genus Varanus. This led Jones (1995) to posit that the 273 smaller lizards became paratenic hosts for these nematodes as they became prey for larger 274 lizards, evidence for upward incorporation. Whether small lizards were added to the lifecycle via 275 upward incorporation or the termites were added via downward incorporation remains less clear.",

            "text": "Infection, Deserts, and Climate Change 279 3.1. A history of anthropogenic effects 280 Traditionally, tropical areas, rather than desert ones, have been seen as critical sources of 281 infectious diseases (e.g. Sattenspiel 2000, Artsob et al. 2009, Hennessey et al. 2016) and 282 somewhat ironically, the challenges of arid regions may have caused them to play a role as 283 historical barriers to disease spread. Pathogens (sensu lato = prokaryotic and eukaryotic 284 parasites) that did not evolve in drylands are less likely to have transmission strategies that 285 overcome low host density and less likely to withstand its extreme environmental conditions. 286 The drylands of central Asia, including the Gobi desert, could have represented a natural barrier 287 that restricted overland spread of plague to Europe for centuries (Schmid et al. 2015). Increased 288 trading in the 1300s, particularly along maritime routes, and climatic conditions that favored 289 large-scale wildlife plague outbreaks in Asia likely facilitated the spread of plague to Europe 290 (Schmid et al. 2015). Similarly Rinderpest was unknown in sub-Saharan Africa until the late 291 1800s. Although outbreaks of the disease occurred in Egypt during the Napoleonic Wars, it did 292 not cross the Sahara, presumably because camels, the main method of overland desert travel, 293 were not susceptible to Rinderpest and the spread of the disease below the Sahara is linked with 294 the import of European cattle to horn of Africa in 1887 (Rowe 1994). 295 Anthropogenic effects can also introduce diseases to wildlife in dryland ecosystems with 296 potentially serious conservation consequences, notably via the transmission of livestock disease 297 to wildlife (Beauvais et al. 2019). For example, Saiga antelope are a species of high conservation 298 concern native the semi-arid deserts of Central Asia with populations in Kazakhstan comprising 299 14 the majority of total Saiga numbers (Milner-Gulland et al. 2001). Census numbers started 300 indicating a dramatic decline in Saiga populations beginning around 1998, although the exact 301 reasons for this decline were not immediately obvious (Milner-Gulland et al. 2001). Subsequent 302 years saw further loss of Sagia culminating in a mass die-off of populations in Kazakhstan in 303 2015 (Fereidouni et al. 2019). Further investigation suggested that a combination of 304 anthropogenic factors and changing environmental conditions were at the root of both the 305 longstanding decline in Saiga numbers and the mass mortality event. Key among the 306 anthropogenic influences were transmission of pathogens from domestic livestock to Saiga such 307 as Aphthoviruses responsible for hoof and mouth disease and gastrointestinal nematodes 308 Haemonchus sp., Nematodirus sp., and Marshallagia sp. (Milner-Gulland et al. 2001, Morgan et 309 al. 2006). Additionally, the mass mortality event in 2015 was caused by the bacterium 310 Pasteurella multocida. Although normally latent, this bacterium can become pathogenic in 311 response to environmental triggers, such as hotter than normal temperatures, that are consistent 312 with anthropogenic climate change in these locations (Fereidouni et al. 2019). 313 Similarly, reintroduction of threatened species to their historic range can be a source of 314 anthropogenically-spread wildlife disease (Mathews et al. 2006). Houbara Bustards released by a 315 captive breeding program in Saudi Arabia were the source of a chlamydiosis outbreak in wild 316 flocks (Bailey et al. 1996) and releases of desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizii, were implicated 317 in an of mycoplasmosis among wild tortises in Nevada, USA (Lederle et al. 1997). Thus, health-318 screening protocols, such as screening of marsupial dibblers (Parantechinus apicalis) for 319 gastrointestinal helminths and pathogenic bacteria before release in Western Australia, should be 320 a vital component of any wildlife reintroduction or translocation plan (Mathews et al. 2006).",

Additionally, global climate change and other anthropogenic activities are predicted to 327 promote desertification in multiple regions (Patz et al 2012, Xu et al. 2019). Both of these effects 328 could potentially shift the spatial distributions of various parasite zoonoses (Polley and 329 Thompson 2009) and human populations within drylands could become increasingly at risk for 330 emerging infectious diseases. This includes the emergence of Middle Eastern Respiratory 331 Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012, with bats and camels as intermediate sources of the disease 332 (Zumla et al. 2015) as well as papputaci fever in the Sahara Desert and Oroya fever in the 333 Atacama Desert of Peru, both of which are zoonotic diseases vectored by sandflies (Dobson 334 1989). 335 Desertification is widespread land degradation in dryland regions and occurs on every 336 continent except Antarctica (Adeel et al. 2005). It is a global problem accelerating partly due to 337 disturbance, such as increased drought brought on by climate change, and partly due to stress, 338 such as overuse of resources brought on by rapid increases in human populations (Whitefield and 339 Duval 2020). For example, a 0.3% decrease in rainfall per decade of the twentieth century driven consistent with increased desertification in those 341 areas (Safriel et al. 2007). Additionally, populations in dryland areas have been growing. For 342 example, on average, populations in drylands increased by 18.5% during the 1990s (Adeel et al. 343 2005). Indeed, approximately 10-20% of drylands are already degraded with total area affected 344 by desertification as 6-12 million km 2 and 1-6% of dryland inhabitants live in these areas (Adeel 345 et al. 2005). Food insecurity, less access to clean drinking water, and lower availability to proper 346 sanitation often leads to poor health in these dryland populations (Patz and Kovats 2002, Adeel 347 et al. 2005). Perhaps even more critically, desertification also decreases biodiversity in dryland 348 systems (Safriel et al. 2007, Whitfield and Duval 2020) and biodiversity loss is widely linked to 349 an increase in zootic pathogens (e.g. Mills 2006, Ostfeld 2009, Keesing et al. 2010). Therefore, a 350 potent cocktail of increasing populations living in degraded landscapes at high risk of resource 351 insecurity, poor health, and potential infection to novel pathogens follows with the spread of 352 desertification.",

Human mobility because critical in the spread of 360 global MERS-CoV cases between 2013-2015 with cases presenting in countries such as South 361 Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and the United States (Zumla et al. 2015). However, human 362 movement is not the only means by which infectious diseases originating in drylands can affect 363 other regions. Dust storms from desertified areas can regularly transmit pathogens to non-desert 364 areas (Griffin and Kellogg 2004). For example, incidence of Kawasaki disease, a syndrome 365 consisting of fever, vasculitis, and swollen lymph nodes (Burns et al. 1996), increases in areas 366 affected by dust storms. Japan, Hawaii (USA) and San Diego, California (USA) have all 367 exhibited a greater number of cases when tropospheric wind patterns carry dust from drylands in 368 central Asia and areas of central Chile also show increased incidence when tropospheric, 369 northerly wind patterns transport dust from the Atacama Desert (Jorquera et al. 2015). Although 370 the symptoms of Kawasaki disease and the recruitment of immunoglobulin A into tissues of 371 those diagnosed with it indicate an infection (Rowley et al. 2008), the etiological agent at work is 372 unknown (Uehara and Belay 2012, Jorquera et al. 2015), further underscoring the need for 373 increased knowledge regarding pathogens found in dryland areas. Likewise, Coccidioides 374 immitis, a pathogenic soil fungus causing respiratory distress, regularly re-emerges in the 375 southwestern United States with highest incidence when the substrate is dry in late summer and 376 early fall (Kirkland and Fierer 1996). In California (USA) outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis 377 frequently follow dust storms and these storms can spread the fungus to areas where it is not 378 endemic, such as the San Francisco Bay area (Kirkland and Fierer 1996). There is no practical 379 way of eliminating C. immitis from soil and as the frequency and severity of dust storms increase 380 with climate change (Griffin and Kellogg 2004, Xu et al. 2019), the number of individuals at risk 381 of coccidioidomycosis (Kirkland and Fierer 1996, Tong et al. 2017), along with a host of other 382 dust-borne infections (Griffin et al. 2007), also increases.",

However, the very conditions 387 that make these regions challenging to study -extreme environmental conditions and low 388 population density for various host organisms -also make them potentially untapped natural 389 laboratories for examining eco-evolutionary relationships between hosts and parasites. Thus, 390 desert parasite communities can serve as useful exemplars with which to examine subjects such 391 as the evolution of virulence, mechanisms for widening host spectra, and drivers of the 392 development of different lifecycle strategies. Additionally, desertification and climate change 393 make understanding parasite transmission within these habitats increasingly critical as larger, 394 likely highly resource insecure, populations are projected to live in dryland regions (Kuehn 2006, 395 Safriel et al. 2007, Patz et al. 2012). Thus, human populations within drylands could become 396 increasingly at risk for emerging infectious diseases even while we still know relatively little 397 about the biology of various parasites and pathogens that inhabit arid regions across the globe. 398 Hopefully highlighting this untapped potential will encourage future empirical tests of 399 hypotheses related to parasite ecology and evolution within dryland ecosystems and stimulate 400 wider investigation into the parasitofauna of arid regions in general. 401 Acknowledgements 402 The author thanks two anonymous reviewers along with V.O.

            "text": "survival of infective stages challenging, arid regions provide a unique opportunity to observe eco-evolutionary processes behind levels of virulence, breadth of host spectra, and timing of lifecycles enlisted by parasites to increase their chances of transmission.The evolution of virulence is a key question when considering infectious diseases and predicting conditions that favor various levels of parasite virulence regularly promotes ongoing discussion in this area (e.g. Ewald 1983, Gandon et al. 2001, Choo et al. 2003, Wild et al. 2009, Hite and Cressler 2018). Much of this discussion involves trade-offs between virulence and 101 transmission rate. Indeed, pathogens with high virulence tend to have higher transmission rates 102 in hosts than those with lower virulence (Kennedy et al. 2016). However, these highly virulent 103 pathogens tend to truncate the potential infectious period by killing their hosts more rapidly. Thus, many have postulated that intermediate virulence is an evolutionary optimum (e.g. Fenner 105 and Ratcliff 1965, MacKinnon and Read 1999, de Roode et al. 2005, Atkins et al. 2011).",
