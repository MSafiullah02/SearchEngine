            "text": "Nondomestic cats are among the most biologically imperiled taxa on earth, and numerous species are believed to be threatened with extinction in their natural environment. All 36 nondomestic felid species are included on Appendix I or II of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES1) (CITES 2003), and 16 species or subspecies are listed as endangered or threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 2003). Habitat loss due to human population growth and resource consumption is the main cause of endangerment, and direct killing for predator control is also a factor for some species. The fur trade and poaching for use in traditional Oriental medicine play a lesser role for most species (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Conservation of wild cats is dependent on preserving adequate habitats, populations, and genetic variation in spite of ever-mounting societal pressures. Captive populations of nondomestic felids are valuable as educational, scientific, and genetic resources that can be used to support conservation of wild cats. However, efforts to conserve and manage both captive and wild cat populations frequently are hindered by a poor understanding of felid reproductive biology and the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may influence reproductive success.",

Reproductive studies in cats typically involve investigation of gamete biology, embryology, endocrinology, and cryobiology. These studies use techniques such as electroejaculation for semen collection, artificial insemination (AI1), in vitro fertilization (IVF1) and embryo culture, embryo transfer (ET1), reproductive hormone analysis, and cryopreservation of sperm, oocytes, and embryos. In most cases, extrapolation of reproductive research techniques from domestic cats to nondomestic felids has been straightforward from a technical perspective (given similarities in basic cat anatomy), but efficacy has varied considerably due to pronounced species specificities.",

This situation creates major challenges for the various institutions that might be involved to coordinate oversight of the research projects. Uniformity of techniques and technology, which is a key requirement in this type of research, has generated the need to develop a strategy to transport and establish a temporary standardized laboratory at each collaborating institution or, in essence, to create a \"mobile laboratory\" approach to science. This mobile laboratory strategy is also applicable to other disciplines such as phylogenetics and nutritional and veterinary research, which may be conducted concurrently with reproductive studies and which serve to maximize the acquisition of knowledge from each individual anesthetic event.",

Due to space limitations in zoos, total population sizes for a species in a given region (e.g., North America) may number from a few up to several hundred individuals. Typically, each zoo exhibits one or two animals of a particular species and very rarely has more than four or five cat species in total. With few exceptions, individual zoos lack enough specimens of a given species to provide adequate sample sizes for intensive empirical research. Even when cat numbers at a given zoo are more robust, limitations regarding the frequency of anesthesia, surgery, and/or exogenous hormone treatment reduce opportunity for hands-on study. Under these circumstances, the ability to conduct research at multiple institutions using a mobile laboratory approach becomes invaluable.",

Movement of germ plasma as frozen spermatozoa and embryos is preferable to transporting easily stressed nondomestic animals over vast distances. With proven protocols in place for cryopreserving gametes and embryos and conducting artificial insemination or embryo transfer, it becomes feasible to augment natural breeding with assisted reproduction (Ballou 1992). However, the effective use of this technology as a management tool requires that the most genetically valuable individuals be accessible across holding institutions or countries. In US zoos, because SSP coordinators have played a key role in encouraging participation in these studies, significant progress has been made for some cat species in a relatively short time. A logical extension of using assisted reproduction within zoo collections is to establish routine genetic exchange between ex situ and in situ populations, primarily through the periodic infusion of genetic material (in the form of frozen spermatozoa) from wild cats into the captive population. This approach would support maintenance of adequate genetic variation without the need to remove more wild cats from nature for zoos (Wildt 2000).",

Specifically, at what point do these procedures represent traditional research, and when do they become service efforts (equivalent to clinical intervention at the population level)? It appears logical that applying an established technique with a primary goal of producing offspring or improving genetic management of a population should be considered a service activity. In contrast, experimental procedures performed with a primary goal of generating data to test a hypothesis and possibly improve technique efficiency should remain classified as research studies with continued IACUC oversight.",

Generally, these collaborations are initiated through the national universities (because most foreign zoos lack independent research programs), but all of the hands-on research with nondomestic cats still occurs in the zoos. Technology transfer and scientific training are key to expanding the scope of cat research, especially in creating a collaborative network of international scientists. Capacity building in reproductive sciences also influences developing strengths in other disciplines, such as population management. With a compatible worldwide network of trained researchers and managers, it becomes easier to establish global conservation programs for many cat species. The ability to conduct research in nontraditional settings liberates scientists from the laboratory confines, which, in turn, empowers population managers to begin applying these emerging tools between regions, whether in Cincinnati or at a small zoo in Brazil. With appropriate scientific expertise available in each country, building connections between captive and wild populations also becomes more realistic.",

In turn, the mobile laboratory approach developed for nondomestic cat research can benefit the management of laboratory cat colonies.

Most of these diseases involve single gene mutations and are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Clinical symptoms and disease progression in affected cats frequently are markedly similar to those factors in affected humans, and these disease models have proven invaluable for investigating the molecular basis of disease, pathogenesis, and the use of ameliorative or corrective therapy (Haskins and Giger 1997). For feline models of human genetic disease, the applied advantages of IVF, ET, and embryo cryopreservation for propagating, managing, and preserving populations are immense. With embryo cryopreservation, it is easier to move models between institutions or even countries, to maintain them indefinitely within liquid nitrogen tanks thereby reducing costs for colony maintenance and allowing financial resources to be redirected toward other aspects of model research. Scientists also gain greater control over experimental design, because they are able to schedule timing of pregnancies more precisely and to produce litters consisting entirely of individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the genetic defect.",

Because equipment requirements are minimal (Figure 2a), electroejaculation represents a basic component of many collaborative research studies conducted outside the laboratory, including under field conditions. Recovered semen may be evaluated for volume, presence or absence of sperm, and sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. These semen parameters may be compared among individuals and species to assess the basic reproductive physiology and reproductive status of different species or populations. For example, electroejaculation of cheetahs, lions, pumas, and jaguars has allowed comparison of basic seminal traits in captive individuals with traits of their free-living wild counterparts.",

Variation in sperm motility or viability among species may be indicative of specificities in physiology that may affect sperm processing methods.

However, the survey revealed that most of these males (~80%) had never reproduced in captivity, and the majority had very low sperm counts in their ejaculates.

In cats, AI typically is conducted using laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical technique that allows the sperm to be deposited in the cranial uterus near the oviducts while ensuring that the female has ovulated after hormone treatment. This technique has been used extensively in collaborative studies at multiple institutions, in part because minimal equipment is required (Figure 2b) and the surgery is minimally traumatic, reducing infection risk and recovery time. Insufflation of the abdominal cavity with room air using a bellows eliminates the need for a bulky mechanical insufflator and gas cylinder, and no evidence of increased infection risk has been reported (based on hundreds of laparoscopic procedures). Since this AI technique was developed in the domestic cat (Howard et al. 1992), it has been applied successfully to produce offspring in the following eight nondomestic cat species: tiger, cheetah, snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard, ocelot, tigrina, and leopard cat. Three species (leopard cat, ocelot, and cheetah) were produced after insemination with frozen-thawed spermatozoa (Wildt and Roth 1997). Developing AI protocols in each species involves conducting traditional research studies. However, as these techniques become well established, their use will become more prevalent in clinical situations as a service provided for propagation and population management.",

Currently, application of embryo cryopreservation and transfer as a management tool is being explored in cooperation with the Ocelot SSP. US zoos are attempting to establish a genetically defined ocelot population in captivity and are focusing on the ocelot subspecies (Leopardus pardalis mitis) native to southern Brazil. In collaborative studies in Brazilian zoos, ocelot embryos have been generated using mobile laboratory techniques and cryopreserved for later transport to the United States. To date, more than 80 embryos have been frozen, and this number represents 15 founders for the US population (Swanson 2003). Importation into the United States and transfer of these frozen embryos to produce viable kittens will assist the Ocelot SSP in addressing one of its most pressing conservation needs. As with other assisted reproductive techniques, the classification of cryopreservation procedures as primarily research or service oriented will change as the technology becomes more efficient and is applied routinely as a population management tool.",

For institutions in close proximity (i.e., driving distance) to an established laboratory, this situation does not present an undue burden.

Most airlines regulate the number, size, and weight of containers; however, in some countries (e.g., Brazil), the airlines consider only weight. Because of recent incidents of domestic and international terrorism, heightened airline security has resulted in stricter limitations on carry-on luggage and routine screening of checked baggage. As a consequence, transporting complex electronic equipment in checked baggage or carry-on luggage has become more challenging.",

In many developing countries, limited financial resources and other societal factors may represent nearly insurmountable barriers to conducting scientific research. Accordingly, it becomes critical that scientific trainees and collaborators have an irrepressible drive to learn and apply new skills in completing their research studies, especially when their North American or European colleagues may reside thousands of miles away. The importance of building trust with foreign colleagues cannot be overemphasized. The era of \"extractive\" science thankfully has passed. In the past, North American or European scientists traveled to foreign countries, collected their samples with little local involvement, and returned home to analyze and publish their data. In the 21st century, sensitivity and respect for different cultures, sharing of resources and data, and working collaboratively and collectively in establishing global scientific networks are of paramount importance, especially in the field of conservation.",

Depending on the situation, nondomestic felids can be anesthetized using injectable anesthetics alone, induced with an injectable anesthetic and maintained with inhalant anesthesia, or induced and maintained with inhalant anesthesia alone. With any anesthetic procedure, there is an inherent risk of fatality; however, mortalities are extremely rare in healthy domestic and nondomestic cats with proper anesthetic monitoring. A properly trained veterinarian must be available to initiate and monitor anesthetic procedures. If the attending veterinarian at a collaborating institution has limited or an unknown level of expertise, it is preferable to communicate with the attending veterinarians carefully and to involve a skilled veterinarian who has had considerable experience anesthetizing the species as part of the research or service team.",

For semen collection procedures in most felids, tiletamine-zolazepam (2-7 mg/kg body weight [BW1], depending on the species) has been the agent of choice in providing adequate relaxation and analgesia while maintaining laryngeal reflexes and smooth muscle tone. Exceptions exist for three species: the tiger, which may display grand mal seizures, resedation, and hind limb paresis after apparent anesthetic recovery; and the jaguarundi and puma, which typically do not reach an adequate plane of anesthesia with tiletamine-zolazepam alone (Swanson et al. 2003). In some species (e.g., serval and Pallas' cat), a combined regimen of ketamine (2-4 mg/kg BW) and medetomidine (0.02-0.04 mg/kg BW), with or without butorphanol (0.2-0.4 mg/kg BW), provides adequate anesthetic depth for electroejaculation, although supplementation with low amounts of isoflurane (0.5-1%) often is necessary. This regimen is rapidly reversible with atipamezole (0.2 mg/kg BW), which provides an added margin of safety and avoids the prolonged recovery that may occur with other anesthetics.",

For small-sized cats, inhalation anesthesia may be provided conveniently using a nonrebreathing system. This technique simplifies the equipment requirements and requires only a vaporizer, oxygen flow meter, regulator, and disposable gas scavenger canister (Figure 2e). Compressed oxygen cylinders are readily available in most cities and countries through gas supply companies and can be preordered for delivery to the collaborating institution.

In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS1) and/or the various state wildlife departments regulate research access to endemic wild cat populations. With captive populations in US zoos, scientific studies typically do not require approval or individual permits from federal or state authorities. Internationally, regulatory authorities may vary or even be nonexistent, yet it is the responsibility of the researcher to identify the relevant agencies and regulations. Note that violation of any foreign wildlife law is illegal under US federal statutes (the Lacey Act). Among national and international regulations, the Endangered Species Act and CITES are of primary relevance for cat research. Importation into the United States of any biological samples from cat species listed in Appendix I or II of CITES (i.e., all nondomestic cats) requires a CITES import permit (CITES I) and/or export permit from country of origin (CITES I and II). Processing the permit application and publishing the permit request in the Federal Registrar for public comment, as required, may delay issuing of the permit for several months. More specific information about CITES and USFWS regulations is available online (www.cites.org and www.fws.gov).",

Very few zoos receive funding from the US Public Heath Service, so there has been no regulatory requirement for most zoos to establish formal IACUCs. In some cases, informal review of proposals by the zoo veterinarian, research coordinator, and/or curatorial/keeper staff is considered adequate by the institution; however, the trend is for this process to become more formalized within the IACUC format. Because the nature of research with zoo animals may be quite different from research with laboratory or domestic species, zoo-based IACUCs may use different criteria in judging the appropriateness of proposed studies. Standardization of IACUC review procedures among zoos would ease the regulatory burden associated with cross-institutional collaboration, therefore the establishment of such a policy should be a priority for zoo research coordinators. In the absence of a standardized IACUC review process, zoos should consider accepting IACUC review findings from other established zoological institutions as valid appraisals without requiring additional review from their own in-house IACUCs.",

For example, as assisted reproductive technology becomes more refined, these techniques will be incorporated increasingly into population management programs as service tools to optimize genetic variation. Similarly, clinical intervention with wild populations may entail capturing or anesthetizing individual animals, but with the primary objective of performing a service for maintaining population health and not for conducting traditional empirical research. In these situations, it is unclear whether review and approval of the IACUC should be required before the procedures may be conducted.",

Key to this progress have been collaboration across institutions and countries and a common sense of mission focused on preserving endangered wildlife. If these efforts are to have a meaningful impact on the decline of felid populations, it is imperative to develop basic and applied reproductive sciences further and to incorporate the knowledge into genetic management programs for cats maintained in captivity. On a global scale and of more relevance to wild populations, this knowledge and technology must be accessible to our scientific colleagues in developing countries, which encompass the natural ranges and habitats of most endangered felid species. As advances in reproductive sciences evolve into functional management tools, their application becomes less focused on primary research and more oriented toward providing a management service. From a regulatory standpoint, a distinction should be made between conducting research studies in the traditional sense and using established methods for genetic or clinical intervention at the population level.",
