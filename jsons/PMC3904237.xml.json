            "text": "Inflammation is an essential host defence mechanism, required for protection against pathogenic micro-organisms and viruses. However, an excessive and non-resolving inflammatory response is damaging to the host. For example, in sepsis there is loss of homeostatic control over the inflammatory response mounted against an infectious agent, resulting in a pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulant state that can result in organ dysfunction and death. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is another example, and describes the life-threatening hypoxic complication of excessive pulmonary inflammation that can be triggered by a range of insults, including pneumonia and sepsis.1 Chronic, non-resolving inflammation also underpins a number of other pulmonary diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis are extra-pulmonary examples of this. Resolution of inflammation and restoration of normal tissue function are therefore critical events following the clearance of an infectious agent, to prevent the development of these \u2018complications\u2019 of excessive inflammation. This is now known to be an active process, termed catabasis,2 driven by the pro-resolution lipid mediators resolvin, protectin and lipoxin.3 Lipoxins (trihydroxy-tetraene-containing eicosanoids) are derived from the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid through sequential reactions involving lipoxygenase enzymes (including 15-lipoxygenase type 1 and 5-lipoxygenase in human mucosal tissues).4\u20135 Resolvins are derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and exist as two series (D and E). D-series resolvins are products of docosahexaenoic acid metabolism involving 15-lipoxygenase. E-series resolvins are synthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid involving aspirin-acetylated cyclo-oxygenase 2.6 Protectins are also omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives, generated from docosahexaenoic acid through a 15-lipoxygenase-mediated pathway.7 The pro-resolution effects of these mediators are exemplified by their role in pulmonary inflammation, the setting in which they are best studied. Resolvins, protectins and lipoxins all have a pro-resolution role in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation.8\u201311",

This highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus is more virulent in humans than the 1918 H1N1 virus, with a case-mortality rate of 60% compared with 2\u00b75%.13 In mice, H5N1 was more virulent (infection resulted in shorter survival time) than the H1N1 strain and disseminated to extra-pulmonary sites (brain and spleen) following intra-nasal inoculation. Global transcriptional responses to infection were analysed and showed that the different strains of influenza A virus caused different early responses in gene expression, and that many of the differentially regulated genes were components of the inflammatory response. H5N1 infection was associated with up-regulation of inflammasome genes [including caspase 1 and interleukin-1 (IL-1)], tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and protein kinase R, as well as other inflammation-related genes. Using a bioinformatics approach to analyse gene expression, the authors found that extra-pulmonary dissemination was associated with down-regulation of genes involved in mediating the pro-resolution effects of lipoxin on leucocyte recruitment and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. These included the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 2 gene, the product of which is activated by lipoxins and is an essential intracellular mediator of lipoxin\u2019s effects on inflammatory cell trafficking and cytokine induction.14 Therefore, loss of lipoxin\u2019s pro-resolution effects may be associated with greater influenza A virus virulence, suggesting a protective role for lipoxin in this infection, possibly related to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in this model. The highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus used in this study was less successful at spreading between human hosts compared with other influenza A virus strains, for example the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. A successful pathogen minimizes damage to its host to prolong the availability of its replicative niche and the high case-mortality seen with infection by this H5N1 strain indicates that it is not well adapted to humans. Reduction of lipoxin-mediated pro-resolution effects may contribute to the virus\u2019s poor adaptation to humans.",

The lipoxin-deficient mice were found to have higher serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, both of which are associated with the pathogenesis of murine cerebral malaria. Significantly, treatment with 15-epi-lipoxin A4 significantly prolonged survival in both wild-type and lipoxin-deficient mice, as well as reducing expression of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in the brain. The mortality rate did not differ significantly if lipoxin was administered on the day of infection or 3 days later. Lipoxin therefore appears to increase host survival in a mouse model of cerebral malaria by limiting inflammation, not by enhancing control of parasite levels.",

The authors then used a transgenic rabbit that over-expresses the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase, resulting in threefold to fourfold increased lipoxin production. In these transgenic animals, following the same procedure to establish periodontitis, none of the clinical, histological or radiographic features were found. In the wild-type animals, bone loss could be prevented by the administration of intravenous metronidazole, confirming that P. gingivalis infection was responsible for the features seen. Wild-type rabbits subject to periodontitis induction were then administered a topical lipoxin analogue and this protected the animals from gross soft tissue destruction, leucocyte accumulation and bone loss. Periodontitis is an infectious disease, though the tissue damage characteristic of the condition is thought to be driven by an aberrant host response to infection.26 In this set of experiments, Serhan et al. demonstrate that lipoxin has a role in curbing this excessive response and that this has a protective effect in vivo.",

BPI is an innate immune defence molecule that is active against Gram negative bacteria, through bactericidal effects on bacterial cell membranes, neutralization of lipopolysaccharide and as an opsonin. This was then confirmed in four other epithelial cell lines (OKF6, T84, Caco2 and pulmonary epithelial cells A549). Building on the known bactericidal effect of epithelium-derived BPI on Gram-negative bacteria, the authors sought to examine the effect of lipoxin on epithelial killing of Salmonella typhimurium. Epithelial cell culture was pre-exposed to lipoxin analogue and then incubated with S. typhimurium. This resulted in concentration-dependent increased bacterial killing compared with non-pre-treated cultures. This enhanced bactericidal activity could be significantly inhibited by the addition of anti-BPI, indicating that induction of BPI was largely responsible for this lipoxin-mediated enhanced killing of S. typhimurium. Interestingly, in a mouse model of (non-infectious) dextran sodium-sulphate-induced colitis, oral administration of lipoxin analogue reduced weight loss, passage of blood per rectum and mortality, affirming its role in gastrointestinal mucosal inflammatory conditions.28",

Resolvin D1 had a similar but smaller effect. Administration of resolvin (D1 or D5) was also associated with a significantly lower titre of viable bacteria in the blood and peritoneal exudate, as well as a lesser degree of hypothermia.

In addition, the combined administration of ciprofloxacin and resolvin D1 resulted in lower titres of viable bacteria in blood and peritoneal exudate, and enhanced macrophage phagocytic activity (not seen with either agent alone). The effect of reducing bacterial titres was still seen even when ciprofloxacin was administered at sub-optimal concentrations with a cocktail of resolvin D1, D5 and protectin D1. In Staphylococcus aureus skin infection, using mouse dorsal skin pouches, resolvins D1 and D5 plus protectin D1, when administered with vancomycin (at a sub-optimal concentration) into the pouch, enhanced the clearance of bacteria, resulting in lower viable bacterial titres in pouch exudate and reduced neutrophil infiltration.

As a consequence, these \u2018lost\u2019 neutrophils activated by the burn injury may accumulate and initiate tissue damage inappropriately in healthy tissues. By administering resolvin D2 to the burned rats, Kurihara et al. found that neutrophil chemotaxis was restored to almost normal. When burned rats received intravenous lipopolysaccharide 9 days after their burn injury, pre-treatment with intravenous resolvin D2 improved survival significantly. Similarly, resolvin D2 pre-treatment increased survival following caecal ligation after burns injury. A shorter duration of resolvin treatment that was insufficient to normalize neutrophil chemotaxis did not significantly improve survival in these two models of burns-related sepsis.

In the E. coli peritonitis-associated acute lung injury model, intraperitoneal administration of resolvin E1 also reduced bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts and IL-6 levels, increased neutrophil apoptosis and reduced the histological severity of pneumonia as well as lung myeloperoxidase content (where myeloperoxidase is used as a marker of neutrophil activity).

The pro-resolution, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial-enhancing effects of resolvins, protectin and possibly lipoxins make these appealing candidates for further study in humans. From a therapeutic perspective it is important to note that these pro-resolution mediators enjoy a substantial advantage over steroids for use in the treatment of infectious inflammation, or other systemic inflammatory states, as they are not immunosuppressive agents. \u2018Aspirin-triggered\u2019 lipoxins and resolvins share the pro-resolution effects of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1, respectively, and act by the same intracellular pathways.11,14 This effect is unique to aspirin, and is not shared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which do not trigger the biosynthesis of these mediators. Due to its ability to trigger the production of these pro-resolution mediators there may be a new role for aspirin in managing the inflammatory sequelae of infectious disease.",
