SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through close contact and through respiratory droplets [2] . Similar to many other viral particles, transmission is increased at lower temperatures. Viral-laden droplets are more effectively produced due to increased evaporation at lower relative humidity, allowing for viral particles to remain airborne for longer [10] . Once viral particles enter the respiratory tract, the virus attaches to pulmonary cells followed by endocytosis.",

Once the virus enters the host cell, the viral RNA is exposed. Open reading frames 1a and 1ab (ORF1a and ORF1ab) are translated, producing polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). These polyproteins are later cleaved to form structural proteins for the RNA replicasetranscriptase complex, which is responsible for the replication and transcription of viral RNA. Viral nucleocapsids are assembled and bud from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) . As viral nucleocapsids encase viral RNA to produce new coronavirus virions, they are exocytosed, completing the replication cycle. Viral replication is summarized in Figure 3 [11] [12] [13] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. It is one of seven human transmissible coronaviruses and is thought to have originated from the bat Coronavirus. The first human cases were documented in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and are thought to be a result of transmission through an intermediate host, likely the pangolin. Human-to-human disease transmission primarily occurs through respiratory droplets. Once in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 enters the pulmonary cells through endocytosis via the ACE-2 receptor. The mean incubation time is 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5-5.8 days), with 97.5% of those who develop symptoms doing so within 11.5 days (95% CI: 8.2-15.6 days). Symptoms may vary from mild to severe but are typical of other viral illnesses including Influenza. The basic reproduction number is reported to be between 2.13 and 4.82. Those most affected by COVID-19 are those of advanced age and those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions. Final mortality rates are currently unknown, as a large portion of cases have not yet resolved, but estimated case fatality is between 0.25% and 3.0%. Treatment options are limited to supportive care and management of ARDS in severe cases. Ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, camostat mesylate, and tocilizumab as potential therapies. Lopinavir and ritonavir do not appear to be effective. Currently, no vaccine is available, although efforts are in progress to developing a vaccine over the coming year. Caution should be used when using corticosteroids in non-ARDS COVID-19 patients, as no mortality benefit has been observed and viral clearance can be prolonged. The use of ACEis and ARBs should not be discontinued in efforts to prevent or reduce the",
