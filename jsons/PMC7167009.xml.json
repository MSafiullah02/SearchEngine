            "text": "Human beings are often exposed to and infected by micro\u2010organisms such as bacteria, moulds and viruses during day to day living. Accordingly, the use of antimicrobial agents is important to maintain a sanitary environment and avoid infection. Among various antimicrobial metals, silver has a wide antimicrobial spectrum and relatively high safety (TIC 1998). Concerns have been raised, however, regarding the bactericidal activity of silver nanoparticles that exhibit considerable antibacterial activity (Sondi and Salopek\u2010Sondi 2004; Chamakura et al. 2011; Ivanova et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2011; Schacht et al. 2012). A comprehensive review on the antimicrobial action and mechanism of silver nanoparticles has been reported by Rai et al. (2012). However, silver nanoparticles usually gather into large particles, leading to a decrease in antimicrobial activity. To decrease silver usage and cost and increase the stability of antimicrobial agents, it is necessary to load silver onto inorganic carriers. Recently, many environmentally friendly inorganic antibacterial materials containing silver have been developed, with some now in commercial use (Kawahara et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2001; He et al. 2004; Pape et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2008a,b; Kwakye\u2010Awuah et al. 2008; Lalueza et al. 2011). Therefore, the development of inorganic bactericides and disinfectants by loading silver onto various inorganic carriers is receiving extensive attention for application in domestic and industrial fields.",

            "text": "Mesoporous silicas, such as SBA\u201015, possessing high surface area, porous volume and adjustable pore size diameter, are ideal supports. Their remarkably high surface area favours the high dispersion of active components on the support surface, and the improved accessibility of active sites for reaction gases should have a favourable impact on catalytic activity (Sayari 1996; Tian et al. 2009). Furthermore, if antimicrobial metals could be confined in the mesopores of SBA\u201015, the elution amount of metals might be largely reduced. Because of its excellent properties as a catalytic support, SBA\u201015 is one of the most promising carriers for the development of high\u2010performance antimicrobial materials. Antimicrobial material using silver nanocrystals encapsulated in mesoporous silica MCM\u201041 has been prepared previously and was found to exhibit high antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria (Liong et al. 2009). Cai et al. (2006) prepared silver\u2010loaded SBA\u201015 material through a silver mirror reaction and used it as an effective bactericide against Staphylococcus. Up to now, reports on the interaction of silver\u2010loaded mesoporous silicas with bacteria are rare, and the antimicrobial mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, further work is needed to study the antimicrobial activity, antimicrobial mechanism and chemical durability of silver\u2010loaded mesoporous silica.",

These micro\u2010organisms could be completely inactivated within 30 min on the Ag/Al2O3 surface at room temperature in air. When Ag/Al2O3 was used in water, the elution of Ag+ from the catalyst into water was a problem. Although Ag\u2010Ce/AlPO4 could significantly decrease the elution of Ag+, the catalyst showed only moderate bactericidal activity. Therefore, to develop an excellent antibacterial material with high antimicrobial activity and chemical durability, silver\u2010loaded mesoporous silica SBA\u201015 (Ag/SBA\u201015) antimicrobial materials were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI)), impregnation (Ag/SBA\u201015(I)) and direct hydrothermal synthesis (Ag/SBA\u201015(DHS)). It was expected that the incipient wetness impregnation method would decrease the elution of Ag+ from the antimicrobial material into water by immobilizing Ag in the pores of SBA\u201015. Using E. coli as an indicator bacterium, the antimicrobial activities and mechanism of the Ag/SBA\u201015 materials were investigated by examining the diameter of the inhibition zone, bactericidal activity, effects of ROS and Ag+ and morphological changes during the process of cell death.",

As a result, the dark particles observed corresponded to Ag particles. The size of particles in the mesopores was about 2\u20135 nm. By contrast, most Ag particles were spread on the surfaces of Ag/SBA\u201015(I) and Ag/SBA\u201015(DHS) with sizes between 10\u201330 nm.",

The eluted Ag+ concentrations measured for various specimens after different periods in water with vigorous stirring are shown in Table 3. As shown from Table 3, the concentration of Ag+ eluted from Ag/SBA\u201015 (IWI) was only 0\u00b7039 mg l\u22121 within 120 min. However, after 120 min, the amounts of Ag+ eluted from Ag/SBA\u201015 (I) and (DHS) were 0\u00b7275 and 0\u00b7498 mg l\u22121, respectively. It is worth noting that the amount of Ag+ eluted from Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI) was much less than that from Ag/SBA\u201015(I) and (DHS), indicating that incipient wetness impregnation largely reduced the speed of silver elution and decreased the potential health risk to human beings. The maximum permissible concentration level of Ag+ in drinking water is 0\u00b709 mg l\u22121, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) (S\u00f6kmen et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2003). The obvious decrease in the release rate of Ag+ might be due to the slow diffusion in mesopores. Furthermore, at a concentration of 0\u00b75 mg l\u22121, Ag+ showed low bactericidal activity within 60 min (Fig. 3b), while the concentration of Ag+ eluted from all Ag/SBA\u201015 materials was less than 0\u00b75 mg l\u22121 within 120 min. These results clearly suggest that the toxicity of Ag+ in solution was not fully responsible for the inactivation of E. coli by Ag/SBA\u201015. Considering that Ag/SBA\u201015, as an oxidative catalyst (Tian et al. 2009), should have the capacity to transform O2 into ROS that might contain superoxide anions (\u02d9O2\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (\u02d9OH), we supposed that ROS catalytically formed by the catalyst might also contribute to the bactericidal effect of Ag/SBA\u201015 during the bactericidal process. The differences in bactericidal activities among Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI), (I) and (DHS) shown in Fig. 3(b) might be due to the different concentrations of Ag+ eluted and the different amounts of ROS that could diffuse and come into contact with E. coli. In the following experiments, ROS scavengers were added to clarify the effect of extracellular ROS on bactericidal activity.",

The effect of ROS scavengers on the bactericidal activity of 1 wt% Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI) is shown in Fig. 4. The bactericidal effect was weakened by the addition of catalase or methanol, compared with the control experiment without any ROS scavengers, at corresponding time intervals. When two scavengers (SOD and catalase) were introduced together, the bactericidal effect decreased further. These results suggest the formation of \u02d9O2\u2212, H2O2 and \u02d9OH on the Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI) surface and their contribution to the bactericidal effect. As previously reported, transition metals such as silver can catalyse H2O2, resulting in the formation of \u02d9OH (Inoue et al. 2002; Pape et al. 2004). Furthermore, to exclude the effect of Ag+ existing on the surface or in mesopores of catalysts as well as dissociated Ag+, bactericidal activity was examined in physiological saline. The bactericidal activity noticeably decreased in physiological saline compared with that in deionized water. The effect of physiological saline was higher than the toxicity of Ag+ alone (Fig. 3b), indicating that Ag+ on the surface or in the mesopores of the catalyst played a catalytic role because the redox process of Ag0/Ag+ usually contributes to the formation of ROS through Fenton\u2010like reactions. The growth curve of E. coli in water was the same as that in 0\u00b79% NaCl with no addition of Ag/SBA\u201015. Thus, the bactericidal effect of Ag/SBA\u201015 was a synergistic action of extracellular ROS and Ag+. Similar phenomena were found in the bactericidal processes of Ag/SBA\u201015(I) and (DHS) (not shown).",

On the basis of the TEM investigation and PI\u2010positive results, after treatment with Ag/SBA\u201015 (IWI), (I) and (DHS), the cell wall and cell membrane were destroyed, which might lead to a change in cell membrane permeability and leakage of intracellular substances. K+ exists universally in bacteria (Heefner 1982; Lu et al. 2003) and plays an important role in the regulation of polysome content and protein synthesis. The release of intracellular protein and nucleic acid is also an important indicator of cell membrane damage (Woo et al. 2000; Hong et al. 2004). Therefore, leakage of K+, nucleic acid and protein from E. coli cells was used to further examine the permeability and damage of the cell membrane. Table 3 shows the changes in K+, nucleic acid and protein concentrations in the presence of various 1 wt% Ag/SBA\u201015 samples, with SBA\u201015 as the control. In the case of the SBA\u201015 control, there was almost 0\u00b71 mg l\u22121 of K+ leakage from E. coli cells, and the amount of K+ had no observable increase for 60 min. In the presence of Ag/SBA\u201015, however, about 0\u00b72 mg l\u22121 of K+ leaked from the bacterial cells just 10 min after the addition of samples, which should be attributed to a notable change in the structure of the outer membrane. The K+ concentration increased with increasing time and reached relatively steady values after 60 min, when nearly 100% cell inactivation was achieved. Nucleic acid and its related compounds, such as pyrimidines and purines, were detected using a NanoDrop spectrometer. The leakage concentration of nucleic acid of cells treated with 1 wt% Ag/SBA\u201015 was 2\u20135 times higher than the 1\u00b71 ng \u03bcl\u22121 of the control suspension. Furthermore, the release of intracellular proteins was also found in suspension for injured cells. The amount of protein released into the treated cell suspension was much higher than that released into the control suspension. The presence of these intracellular contents in suspension indicated severe damage to cells at the membrane level. The cell wall and membrane damage was achieved through intracellular ROS induced by extracellular ROS with strongly oxidizing properties and Ag+.",

It is well known that Ag+ in high concentrations exhibits bactericidal activity (Feng et al. 2000; Matsumura et al. 2003), and Ag+ elution from Ag\u2010loaded materials cannot be avoided under the experimental conditions. Lalueza et al. (2011) reported that 1\u00b75 mg l\u22121 of silver nitrate did not show significant antimicrobial effects. Our results also showed that at a concentration of 0\u00b75 mg l\u22121, Ag+ showed low bactericidal activity. In this study, Ag+ concentration was lower than the 0\u00b75 mg l\u22121 eluted from each Ag/SBA\u201015 catalyst prepared with different methods, which indicated that the antimicrobial activity did not depend on the toxicity of silver ions only.",

            "text": "Experimental results indicated that silver loaded on SBA\u201015 also involved extracellular and intracellular ROS roles in the process of cell death. The addition of SOD, catalase and methanol proved the production of extracellular ROS. When Ag was dispersed as metal particles on some oxides, the Ag particle surface might have sufficient defects for dissociative chemisorption of oxygen (Bera et al. 1999, 2000). Therefore, it was believed that the redox cycle of Ag+/Ag0 maintained the catalytic process of extracellular ROS formation. Furthermore, Ag+ might be helpful for the production of extracellular ROS according to the Fenton\u2010like mechanism. Importantly, extracellular ROS induced intracellular ROS production and death of cells. Moreover, Ag+ also aided in the generation of intracellular ROS, which were produced through respiratory enzymes by Ag+ (Matsumura et al. 2003). This was proved by the appearance of DCF\u2010positive cells treated with 0\u00b75 mg l\u22121 Ag+ (Fig. 5). In all, the catalytically antimicrobial effect should be considered as a synergic action of extracellular ROS and Ag+. Intracellular ROS was the candidate mediator for the death of cells involved in the Ag/SBA\u201015 antimicrobial system.",

Bacteria were cytostatic when in contact with AgNP/Clay, implying that the motor function of the cytoskeletons was hampered (Su et al. 2009). Previous research also indicated that silver nanoparticles affected membrane receptor internalization and cellular signalling and protein expression (Jiang et al. 2008). Yamanaka et al. (2005) confirmed that silver ions could penetrate cells and affect ribosomal subunit proteins and some enzymes important for bacterial cells. Furthermore, owing to the membrane damage caused by silver nanoparticles, cells cannot effectively extrude Ag+ and restrict their effect (Hwang et al. 2008). According to the literature and production of intracellular ROS, some Ag/SBA\u201015 particles that contacted with cells might have disturbed normal physiological function of membrane proteins, such as channels or receptors, and consequently interfered with the proton pool in the membrane space or the electronic flow through the respiratory chain. Accumulated electrons could be transferred to oxygen to form intracellular ROS, leading to oxidative damage and membrane leakage in bacteria.",

The silver species strongly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the samples by catalysing the reaction of adsorbed O2 to form extracellular ROS, such as \u02d9O2\u2212, H2O2 and \u02d9OH. The antimicrobial effect was a synergistic action of extracellular ROS and toxicity of Ag+, which induced the production of intracellular ROS and death of cells. With strong oxidizing properties, ROS resulted in the destruction of the cell wall and cell membrane of E. coli, leading to leakage of intracellular components such as K+, nucleic acid and protein. Considering the low amount of Ag+ elution, the Ag/SBA\u201015(IWI) mesoporous material prepared by incipient wetness impregnation was the most promising antimicrobial technology application for drinking water treatment. Further work on the antimicrobial activities of these materials against Gram\u2010positive bacteria and fungus is still required.",
