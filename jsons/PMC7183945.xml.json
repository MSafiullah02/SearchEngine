Flexibility is paramount in these difficult times, with the burden placed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system demanding adjustments in resident and fellow scheduling, re-evaluation of trainee expectations and duties, and an appraisal of the residency graduation requirements.",

For current PGY-4 ESIR residents, the postponement of the Radiology Core examination to November 2020 poses a unique scheduling challenge. To maximize studying, many residents desire lighter rotations leading up to their Core exam. However, rotations in IR, the ICU, and IR-related rotations are time-intensive. Residency programs may consider rescheduling these rotations such that the resident has a less time-intensive rotation preceding their Core exam in November 2020. If a program decides to alter an ESIR resident's schedule, the number of IR and IR-related rotations required for ESIR should be unchanged. One option is to reschedule an ICU rotation or an IR-related rotation to May or June 2020, such that a lighter rotation is scheduled in the month preceding the Core exam.",

Additionally, the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is an important consideration and conservation of PPE is of great importance (2).

The scheduling disruptions, the impact on graduation requirements, the decreased confidence that may come with a reduced case volume, and the possible redeployment to a non-IR clinical service are all stressors that can lead to burn-out, fatigue, and loss of morale amongst IR trainees.
