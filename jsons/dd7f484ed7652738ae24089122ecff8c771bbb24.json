We should then develop work procedures that reduce the actual risks to low levels. The BVA COSHH Manual is a useful guide and suggests a framework on which we can base our individual assessment. The assessment requires us to identify and list all the hazards that occur in each work area. Some of these may have defined maximum exposure limits, which should be recorded. In addition, the way in which harm can be caused, and contingency plans in case of accidental exposure, should be noted. Much of this information can be extracted from the COSHH hazard data sheets supplied by the pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers. Grouping substances into broad categories makes this exercise less daunting than it might first appear. The next step is to devise methods to reduce the risks. It may be possible to discontinue the use of very dangerous substances by using less hazardous alternatives. Strict work protocols (standard operating procedures) may be devised to reduce exposure. These may include the use of mechanical aids (eg, scavenging of waste anaesthetic gases). If the exposure can be reduced, no further appropriate protective clothing or devices may be necessary.",

Descriptions of the equipment and physics of the technique appeared in the medical literature at that time (Ambrose 1973 , Hounsfield 1973 . The initial application of the technique was for the detection and accurate localisation of intracranial masses and was rapidly widely adopted for that purpose. Since that time it has also been used in other spheres of human medicine, for example the detection of orbital, thoracic and abdominal masses and for investigation of intervertebral disc disease.

Plain skull radiographs are rarely of value in the diagnosis of space occupying intracranial masses although Lawson and others (1984) have described radiographic changes including frequent hyperostosis of the skull in association with meningioma in cats. Hyperostosis of the skull in the dog in association with meningioma is less common (Braund and Ribas 1986) . Various contrast techniques were employed to assist in radiographic diagnosis such as sinus venography, cerebral arteriography and contrast ventriculography; these techniques have been reviewed by Barber and others (1987) , but all procedures suffer from being invasive, inaccurate, unreliable and sometimes inappropriate for the lesion suspected. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities associated with intracranial masses including tumours have been described (Bailey and Higgins 1986 ), but although the results are useful in the diagnosis of inflammatory or infectious disease, the changes associated with most neoplasms are rather non-specific. The withdrawal of CSF from dogs with raised intracranial pressure can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality (Kornegay and others 1983) . The application of CT scanning to small animals suspected of suffering from intracranial lesions was taken up rapidly by veterinary neurologists.",

In general, dogs with intracranial masses will show abnormalities of the neurological examination indicative of a brain lesion (some others will show seizures only, with no interictal abnormalities). Dogs which have signs that can be accounted for by a single intracranial lesion are usually best investigated, initially at least, by CT scanning. Dogs showing multifocal neurological involvement are most likely to have an infectious or inflammatory disease process, these cases may be better investigated initially by CSF analysis. However, withdrawal of CSF from an animal in which the intracranial pressure is increased can be hazardous (Kornegay and others 1983), and should be avoided unless the pressure can be reduced (eg, by mannitol, or oxygen administration). Some inflammatory diseases, in particular granulomatous meningoencephalitis, can be associated with abnormalities visible on CT scans.

In addition, information can sometimes be acquired relating to pressure changes within the ventricles. Increase in pressure is shown by the presence of periventricular oedema (Fig 19) . When increased pressure cannot be demonstrated but there is ventricular enlargement a diagnosis of ventriculomegaly can be made. Enlarged ventricles are defined by comparing the width of the lateral ventricles w i~ the internal width of the cranial cavity. Normal dogs were found to have a ventricle: cranial cavity ratio of less than 0.15, in a study on the Maltese dog (Simpson 1990) . Ventriculomegaly can be found in animals which have undergone cerebrocortical atrophy, such as those with post hypoxic laminar necrosis.

Also, on CT scans there is frequently poor definition of caudal fossa structures [Fig 4) common in this region due to 'beam hardening', which is due to a high level of beam attenuation during its passage through the large mass of adjacent dense bone. This leaves a relatively small number of high energy photons to be attenuated through the adjacent soft tissue (Crawley 1990) rendering the image unrepresentative of this second portion of tissue. This artefact is also commonly encountered in man and is one of the reasons that magnetic resonance scanning is preferred for imaging of infratentorial neural tissue in man (Smith 1987) .

Dogs were the only species to develop aggression, dementis, pica, megoesophagus and coma. In animals less than five years old seizures, lethargy and abdominal pain were more likely. In those over five years old, polydypsia and polyuria were more often found. In birds an increase in very liquid droppings was the commonest sign; regurgitation, lethargy and anorexia were also common. Parrots were also prone to bloody droppings and polydypsia.

Thoracic radiographs taken shortly after admission demonstrated multiple areas of patchy alveolar infiltrate superimposed over a marked bronchial pattern (Fig 3) . Although a serum chemistry profile was normal, the complete blood count indicated leucocytosis (17,800 WBC/yl), with an eosinophilia (3560/y1). Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia was suspected and a transtracheal aspirate was performed the following day. Cytology revealed large amounts of mucus, numerous eosinophils and both degenerate and non-degenerate neutrophils. A culture of the aspirate showed no bacterial or fungal growth. Faecal flotation and Baermann sedimentation were negative. Both Knott's and occult heartworm antigen (ELISA, Synbiotics) test were negative. A diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, caused by an unknown allergen was made and the dog was started on glucocorticoids (prednisone) at 10 mg orally twice a day. After two days, there was marked resolution of respiratory distress and the glucocorticoid dose was decreased to 5 mg twice a day for the next two days. The cough and laboured breathing resolved completely. Followup thoracic radiographs were not taken. After Lateral and dorsoventral radiographs of a four-yearold Jack Russell terrier with coughing and dyspnoea. There is diffuse and patchy alveolar infiltrate, accompanied by a prominent bronchial pattern. The bronchial infiltrate is partially obscured by the alveolar infiltrate gradual reduction over the next two weeks, glucocorticoids were discontinued. At 36 months after treatment there have been no recurrent episodes of respiratory distress.",

            "text": "The respiratory tract is in constant contact with the external environment and is vulnerable to massive antigenic stimulation. The lungs are well protected by a variety of immunological defence mechanisms preventing pulmonary injury by inhaled or aspirated agents (Felsburg 1986, Gorman and Halliwell 1989) . Hypersensitivity reactions (allergies) represent an exaggerated immune response resulting in host tissue injury. These reactions have been divided into four types based on the underlying immunological process (Felsburg 1986). Type 1 (immediate hypersensitivity) is probably the most common reaction involved in immune injury to pulmonary tissues, but types 2, 3 and 4 also appear to play varying roles (Wilkie 1982 , Felsburg 1986 , Noone 1986 , Bauer 1989 , Gorman and Halliwell 1989 , Halliwell and Gorman 1989 . The eosinophil is an integral component of disorders associated with hypersensitivity as well as certain parasitic diseases (Center and others 1990). Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia is characterised by pulmonary infiltrates with an associated peripheral and, or, pulmonary eosinophilia. It should be emphasised that pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia is not a specific disease, but rather a manifestation of several different hypersensitivity reactions. Commonly, a specific aetiology is not found. Hypersensitivity to respiratory tract parasites such as Aelurostrongylus, Paragonimus, Filaroides and Capillaria species can cause peripheral and, or, pulmonary eosinophilia, as well as pulmonary infiltrates. Migration of intestinal parasites such as Toxocara or Ancylostoma species through the respiratory tract may cause a similar reaction. These parasites are detected by faecal examinations, both standard flotation techniques and Baermann sedimentation. Examination of tracheal or bronchial secretions may be of even greater benefit, as ova or larvae may be concentrated in these secretions and more readily identified. No evidence of pulmonary or gastrointestinal parasitism was found in the dogs of this report.",

Subsequent inflammatory reaction is characterised by an unusually high number of eosinophils. In two previous M. MOON I reports of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia in dogs, four of 13 cases were diagnosed as having occult heartworm disease on the basis of necropsy or radiographic findings (Lord and others 1975, Grauer and Riedesel 1977) . Occult heartworm tests (ELISA) were negative in both dogs of this report and neither dog showed radiographic changes consistent with heartworm disease. Hypersensitivity reactions also have been reported with fungal and bacterial infections (Noone 1986). No evidence of these infections was found in the two dogs on the basis of culture, cytology and serology. In humans, certain drugs have been reported to cause pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia; however, in veterinary medicine, these reactions are poorly documented (Weg 1982). There was no history of drug administration in either dog of this study before the onset of clinical signs. Allergic bronchitis (affecting the airways primarily) and allergic pneumonitis (primarily affecting the lung parenchyma) are hypersensitivity reactions to inhaled allergens. Hypersensitivity apparently results from allergic reactions to moulds, actinomycetes and other proteins deposited in airways of sensitised individuals (Halliwell and Gorman 1989). In humans, such diseases as farmer's lung, a reaction to Microspora faeni found in decaying organic matter and mouldy hay, and pigeon breeder's disease, a reaction to pigeon serum proteins, have been identified (Wessels and others 1973, Wilkie 1982, Noone 1986, Halliwell and Gorman 1989). In animals, the allergen is usually not determined, but may be responsible for cases of pulmonary hypersensitivity where an aetiology such as lungworms or heartworms is not identified. This is most likely the case in the two dogs in this report.",

The dose is reduced slowly over several weeks, as long as clinical and radiographic signs do not recur. Some animals with pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia can be weaned off glucocorticoids completely, while others need maintenance therapy daily or every other day. If parasites are detected, appropriate anthelmintics are used in conjunction with the glucocorticoids. In cases of occult heartworm disease, glucocorticoids may be used for resolution of the hypersensitivity pneumonitis prior to adult heartworm therapy. One dog in this report required several weeks of glucocorticoid therapy but was weaned off therapy completely without recurrent episodes. The other dog required only a short course of therapy for resolution of clinical signs and had no recurrent episodes. A number of limb deformities can arise from the total or partial premature closure of growth plates. During skeletal maturation, correct forelimb function is dependent on synchronised lengthening of the radius and ulna. Any disturbance in the growth of one of these bones will profoundly affect the other and may lead to a variety of defects. The most commonly affected growth plate is that of the distal ulna (Ramadan and Vaughan 1978) . More rarely the distal radial growth plate is affected and this results in elbow subluxation, carpal varus and radial bowing (Clayton Jones and Vaughan 1970). A number of corrective surgical techniques may be utilised, depending on the age of the animal and the exact nature of the defect (Vaughan 1976). These include osteotomies, Kirschner apparatus for external fixation (Brinker and others 1983) and bone lengthening procedures (Prieur 1989 ). An alternative technique for treating elbow subluxation and maintaining bone length in cases of premature closure of the distal radial growth plate is to transect the radius and insert K-wires percutaneously into the radius and ulna. These are then connected using elastic bands to apply sufficient force to draw the proximal radial fragment up into articulation with the humerus (Mason and Baker 1978). This technique was selected for the treatment of a dog with 'short radius syndrome'.",

Subluxation in this case had corrected within two weeks but was not maintained when the elastic bands/Kwires were removed. As the subluxation had been present for some time, it is possible that the articular surfaces had become dysplastic, so that accurate, permanent reduction was not possible using the elastic bands/K-wires alone.

Clinical examination revealed a bright dog with a superficial lymphadenopathy. The main findings were dermatological and these included areas of alopecia, crusting lesions with purulent discharge involving the trunk, limbs, feet and chin. Skin scrapings revealed numerous demodex mites at all stages of development. Staphylococcus intermedius was recovered from a swab sent for bacteriological culture and sensitivity. Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture was negative for dermatophytes. Routine haematology and blood chemistry was unremarkable. A diagnosis of generalised demodectic mange with a secondary deep staphylococcal pyoderma was made and treatment commenced with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (Co-trimoxazole 480; Approved Prescriptions Services) half a tablet twice daily (28 mgikg). After one week, the bacterial infection was under control and weekly washes with amitraz (Taktic, SmithKline Beecham Animal Health) 0.05 per cent were instituted. The dog was examined weekly at the veterinary hospital before washes.",

Whole blood clotting time, a clotting profile (including prothombin time, kaolin cephalin clotting time and thrombin clotting time) and blood chemistry were normal. The main haematological finding was thrombocytopenia with low packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration and red blood cell count. Radiographs of the dog's chest and abdomen were unremarkable. A tentative diagnosis was made of drug induced thrombocytopenia and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole treatment was stopped.

Sulphamethoxazole is commonly combined with trimethoprim for use in man while in the dog sulphadiazine-trimethoprim combinations are more common. Neither the choice of sulphonamide to be u.sed with trimethoprim nor its pharmacokinetics are necessarily important (Barnett and Bushby 1970, Bushby 1980) . When tested against 269 strains of 26 species of bacteria of animal origin trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was found to be very effective (Barnett and Bushby 1970) . It would therefore appear that trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combinations are efficacious in animals but it should be noted that this combination does not have a product licence for use in the dog.

One dog also became thrombocytopenic but no details were given. Medleau and others (1990) reported six dogs of various breeds, but not dobermann pinschers, which developed skin eruptions when treated with either trimethoprim-sulphadiazine or trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole.

This raised the problem of what to do with litters at seven or eight weeks old. Experience had shown that if they were rehomed at this early age many would never be neutered. Large numbers of these litters could not and should not be kept in kennels until the traditional age for neutering, and many healthy puppies and kittens were being put down. The members at the RSPCA AGM in June 1990 were persuaded that these litters could be neutered and rehomed immediately.

Concern was heightened by the realisation that the demands made of individuals by the Association increased every year and the day was fast approaching when it would be impossible for any practice to release veterinary surgeons to the extent that these roles required. Practices could not be expected to bear this burden any longer. It was time to acknowledge once and for all that the major strength of the BSAVA is the energy it derives from its volunteer corps and its main asset is the time they put in; it was essential to do everything possible to increase their efficiency and save their time. So a major restructuring of the Administtation Office was undertaken and a clear three year plan instituted to equip it to lift much of this burden from the shoulders of the Executive. When I took over the chain of office, plans were already underway for the most important step in this process and in May, one of the highlights of my year was when the Association purchased Kingsley House. We moved in in October and as most of you know, the new Administration Office was formally opened by the Mayor of the Borough of Tewkesbury on December 6. But this major landmark in the Association's history is only stage 1 of a vital three year plan to improve the secretarial support for those who run the Association in their spare time. There is still much to do in terms of equipment, facilities and staff training before we can consider these objectives to have been realised. The Association now employs a permanent full time Administration Officer and seven full time permanent secretariesall part of this vital strategy.",

What this has meant in practice has been a redefinition of the roles of VN (Veterinary Nursing) Committee P&PR (Publicity and Public Relations) Committee and Scientific Committee and the creation of two new committees, a complete revision of the committee infrastructure to ensure that the Association's activities were performed as efficiently and competently as possible.

Certainly there has never been an infrastructure to accommodate this area of the Association's activities. This year the foundations have been laid for the formation of a Political Committee. The Officers have met 11 times this year, with advisers where necessary, with a full agenda and minutes to discuss the political issues of the day; major matters have been progressed to Advisory and Finance Committee and thence to Council, fully supported by discussion documents and recommendations. This structure has focused input and channelled decision making in a way that was not previously possible and enormously enhanced efficiency.

I quote from his retirement speech to the RCVS Council on February 6 when he said he rejoiced in the progress which the profession had made in that time. He had had a major guiding influence on the profession during this period and the professions excellent standing in Government, Europe and education is in part a reflection upon him. There have been some excellent summaries of his achievements presented in recent months and I do not feel able to surpass these today. You will all have seen brief summaries of his achievements in the RCVS newsletter which unfortunately didn't reveal one of his very few weaknesses, that of being a supporter of Brighton and Hove Albion or as it should be more aptly known: Brighton and Hove and Albion nil. It is not known to many that one of Alastair's very last duties in the college was to do one of his friendly spot checks on a practice in his home county of Ayrshire. Upon arrival he was fascinated by the news that the principal now kept a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, African grey parrot and a wallaby. He kept these in the courtyard at the back of his practice, and being an inquisitive man he naturally wanted to see these beasts. Whilst viewing the collection at the back of the courtyard, a young Australian assistant at the practice came back to be greeted by the horrific news that the Registrar of the Royal College was visiting the practice and was currently out in the courtyard looking at the Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, African grey parrot and wallaby The Australian graduate was aghast, and said, I really must meet this man who signed my certificate, how will I recognise him? The principal said, 'He's the one in the grey hair, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase'.",

A subject that does not naturally sit well with veterinary students but we were all impressed with his persuasive manner and ability to cover what at times can only be described as turgid information in such an erudite and entertaining manner. I recall after the completion of these lectures that I had wished that he would have given our animal husbandry lectures on nutrition. His ability as a lecturer and raconteur has been a great asset as heard so impressively on Thursday evening. In the RCVS he has provided stability over the past 25 years whilst other people have come and gone. I suppose I cannot help but think of Alastair as the kind wise man at the RCVS who in many ways can be likened to Sir Humphrey out of 'Yes, Prime Minister', but in his case the book and the series would be 'Yes, President'. He has had difficult times I am sure with some Presidents and Officers and will have had to draw upon his legal and great diplomatic training in dealing with them. In response to one President who described the effect of the EC on the veterinary profession as a mere storm in a tea cup his answer would have been, 'Well President that is one point of view, but I have prepared a paper on this matter that you may care to read and I would like to point out that the other registrars seem to agree with me'. In response to another President who stated that the postgraduate qualifications would have been the final nail in the coffin of the profession, he answered, 'but think how good it will be on the other side when they all go that way'. I, like so many, look forward to reading his memoirs. In relation to small animal practice, Alastair has been of enormous help, the development of veterinary nursing, specialisation, European matters, practice register, practice standardswhich are all very close to the heart of the Associationhave been greatly aided by his efforts and for this we are indeed very grateful to him. Alastair is not severing his links with the profession and will have a significant role in guiding us through the corridors of power in Europe. We know he will give the profession and this Association sound advice in this area and the Association looks forward to working with him over the forthcoming years. On that note Mr President I would like Alastair to come forward to receive his scroll from you.",

I have not missed a BSAVA Congress since then and we have been involved in dialogue on many interesting things over the years such as veterinary training and the creation of veterinary 'hospitals both of which we now take for granted but were in the one case embryonic and in the other nonexistent in those early days. Your Association, Mr President, has always been associated with the younger end of the profession, with vigorous endeavour and with exciting initiatives, and long may that spirit endure.

It is possible after all to get a veterinary degree without having a single thought in your head. Never mind, I know that in the next three years he will have ample opportunity to carry on thinking.

It would seem to me that it is almost like something that some may remember here and certainly the Editor of the Journal of Small Animal Practice will remember, when we went through a rather awkward phase called product endorsement. And I wouldn't like to see this Association come under one particular banner only. I am not doing this because I don't like the company involved. It is because I think the Association should spread its net and not be too entirely dependent. The other questions I would like answered please sir are if the BSAVA are so hard up and cannot afford to run the Journal out of their own funds, one might pose the question 'Why was Kinglsey House purchased?'. I know the answer but I think it is a good question to ask, if we are short of funds. I think it was a good purchase personally. If the BSAVA also is in need of Journal sponsorship, why didn't we ask five or six companies to provide a fifth or sixth of the money rather than going to one, I know it is a lot easier to get it from one. Finally, not to be flippant about it but I feel we have sold our independence for 30,000 shekels of silver.",

            "text": "Mr Price said, Roger thank you very much for your question. It is very unfortunate that the Editor of the Journal could not be with us to explain the full background to the scenario. Perhaps I can go into some detail. I hope no one in this room will forget the difficulties that the Journal was in two or three years ago, and I don't think we ought to pretend it wasn't in great difficulties at that time. It lost its Editor and its Chairman of the Board of Management and at that stage it took on a new Editor, a Chairman of Board of Management and a new publisher and from that really very shaky basis it has built itself back to the very substantial Journal which we all admire. In so doing it has incorporated a change in format, the binding-in of the news and much else that has made it not only a popular but highly prestigious Journal. These changes have been going on for two or three years and support was very generously offered two or three years ago to help the Journal get itself back on its feet again. This was most definitely not exclusive support. It was available to any of the good companies that support the Association to offer help. Many of them knew we were in trouble and I think we should be very grateful to Pedigree Petfoods. I think at that stage if the Treasurer had come to the AGM and said the Journal is in trouble and members' subscription would have to go up \u20ac10 or more to resurrect the Journal I think the AGM may just have turned that request down. I am extremely grateful to Pedigree Petfoods for the support they have given for the rebuilding of the Journal. Somewhere around August/ September each year the Editor and the Publisher meet with Pedigree Petfoods to see if the educational grant can be extended for another year. I think personally it is right that the Editor should be able to make that type of negotiation on the Association's behalf and he did so this year and he came back to the Officers and the Board of Management with a package which the Board of Management found acceptable. That package was taken to Advisory Committee which considered it very fully and agreed again in principal with the package. The concern in Advisory Committee was that although we had the American edition of Waltham international Focus before us we did not actually have the British edition and Advisory, I think quite wisely, felt it couldn't approve this deal with its support without having the first edition before it. So Advisory waited to see it. Having seen it, the Chairman of Education Committee is very happy with the way that it marries in with his-remit for providing the commissioned articles; the overview type of article that has been extremely difficult for Education Committee to commission. So there is a feeling that this is a publication of high scientific standing which actually compliments the Journal without having any in-house promotion whatsoever that would be detrimental to the Association. The state of play at the moment is that the Board of Management will be meeting quite soon and with the first edition before it. It will be able to consider whether it is appropri-ate to continue the arrangement that was drawn up with the Editor. That decision by the Board of Management will be taken to Advisory Committee and I am sure Advisory Committee will take full note of the comments that have been made this morning.",

No money had passed hands from the membership to the Journal, and that was the situation it found itself in and by saying \u20ac10.00 a head would be necessary to resurrect the Journal that really reflected what had happened in three previous years.

Since then many independent groups with specialist interests have in many ways overtaken the SSGs. Some of the SSGs have been moribund for years and it was felt that this aspect of the Association interest should be looked at again. An Affiliations Working Party was set up reporting to Education Committee and again this matter has been considered by Advisory and Finance, Council and the Constitution Subcommittee. The proposal is that the entire clause 16 relating to SSGs should be deleted and that SSGs will no longer exist.

Tony Bradley's input, has been quite remarkable since he joined the BSAVA in 1963. It's been outstanding and probably unique, rising through Secretary and Chairman of the North West Region, he was a member of Congress Committee for three years followed by P&PR committee for nine years, during which time he was Secretary, then Chairman of that committee as well as Editor of BSAVA News. He progressed from P&PR Committee to become the Association's Treasurer for three years before becoming a Presidential Officer.

It is indeed a difficult subject and the political spectrum appears to change on a weekly basis, but Mr Hilbery is indeed correct that there is some risk that we could lose some control of the Veterinary Nursing Scheme with the RCVS if things progress in their current manor and indeed there is going to be a meeting I believe next week of important Officers from the RCVS, from Veterinary Nursing Committee and the NCVQ themselves to determine exactly what the best plan will be. I am not privy to the deliberations of these people at this moment in time but all I can say is that I will keep the membership informed. Already there are alternative schemes of animal technician training being prepared at this time which will seem to be on a competitive basis with the VN Scheme but in this case with the full backing of Government and the full funding of Government and with proposed tax relief for employers to employ such trainees in terms of animal care technicians. But sadly the content and the aspirations are nowhere near the quality of the veterinary nurses. It is of great concern to us. All we can do is monitor the situation and we are putting in our advice as and when we can, and hope it is taken notice of. Mr J. Henwood said, Mr President, Officers and members I wish to raise the subject of value added tax on veterinary services and medicines in the UK. I am sure you will all realise that farmers, who incidentally have a strong Parliamentary lobby, are zero rated and so can reclaim all their input tax and obviously the tax which is imposed by large animal practices. The full burden of the tax falls on small animal practices and their clients, adding a further 17.5 per cent to the bill and it is the total bill which concerns our clients, Many of the companion animals that we treat are the only other living creature in that home besides the owner. They are an essential and greatly loved member of the family and by no stretch of the imagination can they keep being considered a luxury. I contend that the main reason that our services are so unfairly subject to the tax is that we have failed to oppose it. At my request, zero rating of VAT was discussed by the BVA Salaries and Appointments Committee. Afterwards I was informed that, and I quote, although information on the level of VAT in all the European states has not been extracted, first hand information was available on the situation in Italy, where veterinary surgeons are exempt from VAT? The disadvantages of being exempt were then listed. It was then stated that pressure to achieve zero rating of VAT in this country for veterinary surgeons may result in exemption status being suggested as a further step. The committee, although not wanting to see the VAT raised above 15 per cent, felt that the disadvantages of zero rating to the general practitioner prevented them from supporting your aim. What the committee should have known before discussing my request is the full detail of all member states. For instance, in five states, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Greece, their services are totally exempt from VAT, on their medicines the respective rates are 6 , 9, 6, 0 and 6 . In fact there is a tremendous variation between the VAT on services and medicines. I am advised from Brussels that in January 1992 all exemptions will cease and that exemption will no longer be an option, it will be up to each individual state to impose a rate of their own choice. It seems very likely that the rate on their services will be zero, the 17.5 per cent charged on both our services and our medicines is the third highest in Europe. The highest being Denmark with 22 per cent. Mr President Elect, there is an overwhelming case for the rates on our services and medicines to be changed to zero. You know from your experience with the Cambridge and Glasgow veterinary schools that public campaigns can work. A combined BSAVA/BVA poster in every waiting room, inviting clients to sign a petition and write to their MP would be a good start. It would show the public that we do care about costs and they would be 100 per cent behind us. I would like to ask the Officers of the BSAVA to investigate fully the feasibility of having our VAT zero rated and if favourable they launch a public campaign either in conjunction with the BVA or if necessary on our own. Mr Price said, John thank you very much, that raises many points. It is clearly vital that the profession as a whole speaks together and I am sure the new President will have it top of the agenda for the next Political Committee. We would then carry the matter forward to the BVA and speak together.",

He has worked extremely hard for the Association during the year. His quiet and charming manner backed by his sheer determination has enabled him to achieve the majority of the goals he set himself at the planning weekend just before his term of office. He has certainly brought the BSAVA into the '90s. He introduced new technology that you have heard about, to improve the speed and decision making within the Association but more importantly than that, he always demanded clearly defined and well presented arguments in order that we could make the right decision at the right time. In addition, he refused to become diverted by peripheral issues and channelled maximum effort into the important issues such as practice standards, discount neutering schemes and the successful development of the joint Kennel Club/BSAVA Scientific Committee just to mention a few. Colin was the first Cambridge veterinary graduate to take office as President and he has certainly done the job very well indeed. Colin and Valerie can look back at their hard work and achievements with deep satisfaction. Colin, it is a very great pleasure for me on behalf of the Association to present this as a small token of our appreciation for your service to the Association and particularly during your year as President. The President then presented Mr Price with a painting by Lawrie Williamson.",

Chapters on paw and pad disorders, dermatophytosis, cheyletiellosis, atopy, mast cell tumours, eosinophilic granuloma 'confusion', and genetic defects are comprehensive and well presented. The topic of food hypersensitivity in the cat often causes debate. In this text a three day fast is suggested as a means of 'test diet'many dermatologists would prefer a six to eight week trial period with an elimination diet. The debate continues! The section on cardiac and respiratory disorders is very useful. The chapter on the interaction with systemic disease provides plenty of 'food for thought' diagnostically. Coughing cats, sneezing cats, and cardiac abnormalities in kittens and adults, are all dealt with extremely well. Endocrine and metabolic disorders are tackled in a very practical way, for instance, in detailing the management of post thyroidectomy hypocal-caemia. The management of the feline diabetic, with all the anomalies peculiar to the cat in this situation, is also well covered. The discussion on therapeutics is excellent, particularly with regard to the use of megestrol acetate.

The use of real time grey scale B-mode diagnostic ultrasonography has been mushrooming in veterinary practice and the results of the technology have been in danger of misinterpretation by users who are not fully conversant with the methodology of ultrasound imaging. Thus there exists a need for a primer on the use of diagnostic ultrasound in examining our domestic animals. The publication is in softback form, reasonably priced and written for practitioners as well as researchers. The approach is realistic, starting with basic principles of ultrasound and then covering the organs and structures which can be successfully imaged in the various body cavities and other regions.

The direct and indirect pupillary light responses were poor. Cervical hyperaesthesia was present. Autonomic nervous system function was found to be abnormal on the basis of response to atropine; intrader-ma1 histamine and gastric motility studies.

An outline of the entire animal with a reference box to the scan area might have helped the less experienced to orientate and the use of either photographs or outline drawings of entire organs or topographical areas could offer additional reassurance in interpretation.

Following a change in legislation 12 years ago, duties could include the induction and monitoring of anaesthesia throughout all surgical procedures. The technician could also, Mr Gibson said, provide client education on matters such as vaccinations, dietary considerations and exercise. They provided a useful link between the hospital and public by visiting local schools on career option days and *pet awareness days', Career options for technicians had changed dramatically over the past few years, Mr Gibson said. This was attributed to two reasons. First, practice management had converted practices to business entities, he explained, with clients choosing the practice most suited to their needs. The technicians provided a vital role in client contact and often made the best hospital managers. Secondly, a four year veterinary technology degree was instituted two years ago which comprised a two year general technicians course followed by two years of specialised training in either anaesthesiology, radiology, general laboratory procedures or histopathology .",

The Control of Dogs Order 1930 required that dogs wear identity discs in pubIic places, a neglected provision which local authorities will soon be obliged to enforce under the new Environmental Health Act 1991.",

It is appreciated that many insurance policies exist, but none seems to cater for the requests directed to the funds. These are generally the results of extreme old age, long term illness, breakdown in personal relationships, suicide, fatal accidents and extreme hardship in an inflationary world. The welfare state does not encompass everyone and everything. In this age of intense economic pressures, who knows who may be next. The sudden death of the breadwinner may leave a widow or widower who is unable to work because of young children at home, or unable to find a job because of the increasing level of unemployment. One parent families may manage with pride, but have nothing extra to provide for replacement of large items such as a cooker or fridge or car. Support is often directed to the housebound, supplementing their state benefits by assistance with telephones, television sets, television licenses and supplies of coal, All requests are investigated carefully, thoughtfully and confidentially by an appointed VBF committee member, to enable the funds to be apportioned justly to those in need. During the past year E32,538 was distributed by the VBF to 50 beneficiaries in the form of regular grants, and E23,390 to 59 beneficiaries as special gifts.",

Veterinary TWO animals, a 4.5 month old German shepherd bitch and a seven month old collie dog, had clinical signs of tetanus. Each had the classical signs of exaggerated extensor muscle tone, pricked ears, riisus sardonicus and protrusion of the nictitating membrane. In addition, both dogs exhibited transient megoesophagus and hiatel hernia accompanied by gastro-oesophageal reflux and regurgitation. Radiography confirmed these findings. With intensive nursing, the tetanus resolved as did the gastro-oesophageal lesions. Normal radiographs were obtained after recovery. DIERINGER, T. N. & WOLF, A. M. (1991) Journal ofthe AmericanTWO young, related akitas (four-month-old female: three-month-old male) were presented with severe, non-erosive immune mediated polyarthritis. There was a cyclical febrile illness with marked joint pain. Seven other akitas have shown similar signs with the age of onset ranging from nine weeks to eight months. Concurrent aseptic meningitis was found in two cases. Fever ranged from 40.5 to 41.6OC and each episode lasted from 24 to 48 hours when they would resolve spontaneously. Episodes progressed in severity and in some dogs became refractory to treatment. Two dogs achieved complete remission with immunosuppressive drugs and two dogs gained partial remission. The condition may represent an 'overlap' syndrome, commonly described in man.DOUGHERTY, S. A., CENTER, S. A., SHAW, E. E. & URBE, H. A.",
