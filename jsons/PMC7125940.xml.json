AHSV is closely related to bluetongue virus, which causes bluetongue disease in ruminants. The orbiviruses are characterised by a genome composed of ten linear segments of dsRNA, with one copy of each of the ten segments packaged within each virus particle. The spherical, non-enveloped capsid of AHSV is approximately 70 nm in diameter, is composed of three concentric protein layers (Roy et al., 1994). The outer-capsid layer is formed by two major structural proteins, VP2 and VP5 (encoded by genome-segments 2 and 6 respectively), and is primarily involved in cell attachment and cell entry. VP2 is the most variable antigen of AHSV and is responsible for serotype definition (Burrage et al., 1993).",

The main target of VNAb is AHSV VP2 (Burrage et al., 1993) and several studies have mapped neutralising epitopes to the amino terminal half of the VP2 protein (Bentley et al., 2000, Martinez-Torrecuadrada and Casal, 1995, Martinez-Torrecuadrada et al., 2001).",

MVA vector vaccines for viral infections have proven to be effective against a wide range of viral diseases (Gilbert, 2013), such as Chikungunya (Garcia-Arriaza et al., 2014) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (Chen et al., 2005). Humoral and cellular immune responses elicited against a foreign MVA-encoded antigen are higher than those triggered with the vaccinia Western Reverse strain, in part due to the higher levels of expression of the foreign antigen by MVA (Ramirez et al., 2000). Moreover, MVA is able to elicit strong, specific responses under conditions of pre-existing immunity to the vector (Ramirez et al., 2000), as seen in previous studies using MVA in both prime and boost immunisations.",

However, MVA based vaccines are also able to elicit strong antibody responses (Draper et al., 2013). MVA has been used to develop a promising antibody-inducing vaccine against viral surface proteins, such as the haemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus (Kreijtz et al., 2009), or the spike glycoprotein of SARS (Chen et al., 2005). In vaccination studies for BTV, MVA has been very effective as a vaccine, inducing a robust VNAb response against the expressed VP2 protein (Calvo-Pinilla et al., 2009, Jabbar et al., 2013). Similarly, MVA expressing AHSV-VP2 has been shown to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Castillo-Olivares et al., 2011, Chiam et al., 2009).",

In that study, AHSV-specific interferon-\u03b3 secreting CD8+ T cells were also induced by vaccination with MVA-VP2, but their role in protection could not be evaluated at that time. Previously, Pretorius et al. (2012) demonstrated an increase of virus specific CD8+ T-cells in horses, in response to vaccination with live attenuated AHSV. Vaccination studies in mice using recombinant MVA expressing AHSV-4 NS1, administered in combination with MVA-VP2, also showed specific T-cell responses and a reduction in viraemia following heterologous challenge (de la Poza et al., 2013). In addition, a recombinant Canarypox expressing AHSV-VP2 and VP5 was able to induce VP2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, alongside VNAb. This suggests cell-mediated immunity could play a significant role in the overall level of protection against AHSV (El Garch et al., 2012). However, a clear demonstration of the protective effect of this effector mechanism of immunity, through adoptive transfer of CD8+ T-cells has not yet been reported.",

This suggests that the role of cell-mediated immune responses is less important than the antibody responses in the protection generated by MVA-VP2 vaccination. In addition, it can be argued that the marginal protection against AHSV shown by the recipients of splenocytes could be due to AHSV-VP2-specific B cells contained in the transferred cells. Additional adoptive transfer experiments using cell-sorted CD8+ lymphocytes from donors before challenge could help to elucidate the precise contribution of cell-mediated immunity following MVA-VP2 vaccination.",

In contrast, when passive transfer of antibodies from infected animals was performed, the protection was complete against virulent virus (Jeggo et al., 1984b). In the case of AHSV, the humoral nature of protection against the virus has been demonstrated by the passive transfer of a monoclonal neutralising antibody against VP2 protein in the neonatal mouse model (Burrage et al., 1993). Passive transfer of neutralising antibodies has also been described from AHSV vaccinated mares to foals via colostrum (Blackburn and Swanepoel, 1988, Crafford et al., 2013).",
