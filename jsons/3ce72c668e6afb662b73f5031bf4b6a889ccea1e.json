When formulated with Alhydrogel \u00ae , RBD219-N1 27 induced high-level neutralizing antibodies against both pseudotyped virus and a clinical (mouse-adapted) 28 isolate of SARS-CoV. Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel \u00ae were fully 29 protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to ~ 30% mortality in mice when 30 immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel \u00ae , and 100% mortality in negative controls. 31 An RBD219-N1 formulation Alhydrogel \u00ae was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and 32 AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular 33 infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-34 N1 to Alhydrogel \u00ae provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral 35 loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. As a result, this vaccine formulation is under 36 consideration for further development against SARS-CoV and other emerging and re-emerging beta-CoVs 37 such as SARS-CoV-2. 38 39",

            "text": "For the past two decades, several antigens have been identified and developed as SARS-CoV vaccine 49 candidates. Initially, whole inactivated virus (WIV) or modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing SARS 50 vaccines were developed [1] , however, eosinophilic immunopathology was observed in mice and non-51 human primates immunized with these viral-vectored vaccines [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Even though historically there have 52 been reports that alum adjuvanted vaccines could induces enhancement, such as in the 1960's with the 53 RSV vaccine or even with WIV and S proteins, [8] later, it was shown that alum-adjuvanted WIV elicited 54 less immunopathology than WIV alone [8] . suggesting that alum might reduce immune enhancement, a 55 process possibly linked to mixed Th1, Th17, and Th2 responses [7, 9] . Additional evidence emerged that 56 the virus N protein had a key but not exclusive role in immune enhancement [3, 7] . Based on these 57 studies, the recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV was used as a vaccine candidate [1] , but the full-length 58 S-protein also induced immunopathology, with epitopes outside of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) 59 of the S protein implicated in eliciting this phenomenon [10, 11] . Therefore, the RBD of the S protein 60 was selected as a substitute for the full-length S protein [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . 65 was shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies and highly protective immunity in the vaccinated animals, 66 while eliminating or significantly reducing eosinophilic immunopathology [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] ]. In our previous 67 studies [20] . we developed a production process for several tag-free yeast-expressed recombinant RBD 68 constructs. Such studies down-selected several candidates and ultimately identifying one, RBD219-N1 69 (residues 319-536), as a promising vaccine candidate, due to its ability to induce in immunized mice a 70 stronger anti-RBD-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibodies when adjuvanted with 71 aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel \u00ae ). The protein production process was transferred to the Pilot Alhydrogel \u00ae slurry was mixed for one hour to ensure the binding of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel \u00ae reached 112 an equilibrium state. The slurry was then centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes, and the supernatant 113 was collected while the Alhydrogel \u00ae pellet was resuspended with an equal volume of removed 114 supernatant. The RBD219-N1 protein content in the supernatant fraction and the pellet fraction were 115 then measured using a micro BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MS, USA). Similarly, the presence of 116 RBD219-N1 in the pellet and supernatant fractions was also evaluated using SDS-PAGE. Briefly, after the 117 slurry was centrifuged and separated into pellet and supernatant fractions, the Alhydrogel \u00ae pellet was 118 further resuspended with desorption buffer (100 mM sodium citrate, 92 mM dibasic sodium phosphate 119 at pH 8.9) and mixed for 1 hour. The desorbed RBD was then separated from Alhydrogel \u00ae by 120 centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes. Ten microliters of desorbed RBD from the pellet fraction and 121 free RBD in the supernatant fraction were loaded on 4-20% Tris glycine gels and stained by Coomassie Alhydrogel \u00ae dose range screening. Mice (6 per group) were i.m. immunized with Alhydrogel \u00ae formulated 157 RBD219-N1 at days 0 (10 or 20 \u00b5g RBD), 21 (10 \u00b5g RBD), and 42 (10 \u00b5g RBD). In group 1, a formulation of 158 0.2 mg/mL RBD in 5 mg/mL Alhydrogel \u00ae (2.5 mg/mL aluminum) with the dose of 20 \u00b5g/10 \u00b5g/10 \u00b5g of 159 RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was used for immunization, respectively. In group 2, the formulation 160 0.2 mg/mL RBD in 1.6 mg/mL Alhydrogel \u00ae (consisted of 0.8 mg/mL aluminum) was tested, more 161 specifically, a dosing regimen of 20 \u00b5g/10 \u00b5g/10 \u00b5g RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was used while 162 in group 3, 10 \u00b5g RBD were for all three immunizations. Alhydrogel \u00ae alone and pre-formulated SARS-S 163 protein (3 \u00b5g) were used in groups 4 and 5, respectively, as negative and positive controls. At day 52, 164 sera were collected to evaluate IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. At day 63, mice were i.n. challenged 165 with SARS-CoV (2x LD50 (~10 5 TCID50) SARS-CoV (MA-15)), and finally, on day 66 (day 3 post-challenge) 166 and day 70 (day 6 post-challenge), lungs from 3 mice were collected for histopathology and viral titration. In this pilot study, we compared safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the various yeast-expressed 209 RBD-and S vaccines [8] using a lethal mouse model of SARS--CoV infection. Figure 2a shows that mice 210 immunized with RBD-219N1 had the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies compared to mice 211 immunized with alum-adjuvanted RBD193-N1, wt-RBD219 and the S protein vaccines. Importantly, 212 endpoint evaluation for mortality has shown that a 100% survival rate was found for mice immunized 213 with alum-adjuvanted RBD219-N1, while mice immunized with alum-adjuvanted wt-RBD219 and 214 RBD193-N1 vaccines showed 88% survival and those immunized with alum-adjuvanted S protein showed 215 only 67% survival. All mice in the TBS control group died within 6 days post-challenge ( Figure 2B ). 216 Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD219-N1, similar to wt-RBD219 and RBD193-N1, consistently 217 showed less than 10% weight loss throughout the study period, while mice immunized with other alum-218 formulated vaccines including the S protein showed a maximum of 15-20% weight loss ( Figure 2C ). This 219 was accompanied by more than a 3-log reduction of infectious viral loads within the lungs when 220 compared to mice vaccinated with TBS/Alhydrogel \u00ae (Figures 2D and 2E) . None of the mice given 221 TBS/Alhydrogel \u00ae produced detectable neutralizing antibodies, whereas their geometric means of lung 222 virus titers were 10 9.9 and 10 8.9 TCID50/g on days 1 and 2 post-challenge, respectively. With these results, 223 RBD219-N1 was chosen for further development. Table 1) . Taken together, these results suggest that RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel \u00ae was 238 potentially both effective and safe, and therefore alum was chosen as the optimal adjuvant and further 239 studied for the dose-ranging study. The RBD of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV, which is responsible for the attachment of the receptor ACE2 271 and initiates the process for cell binding and entry, has been proven as a promising vaccine candidate 272 [25] . It has been expressed as a recombinant protein with a hexahistidine tag, a GST protein or Fc Finally, in the Alhydrogel \u00ae dose-ranging study, we observed that a higher concentration of Alhydrogel \u00ae 327 was required to trigger a fully protective immune response with attenuated eosinophils infiltration, while 328 S protein induced a higher degree of eosinophilic cellular infiltration, which is consistent with the 329 previous finding [8] . Table 1A further summarized the comparison of eosinophilic immunopathology   330 induced by different SARS-CoV vaccines, including the S protein, virus-like particle (VLP) expressing spike 331 protein and the inactivated whole virus vaccines. The results indicated that the vaccine using VLP 332 expressing S protein triggered worse eosinophilic infiltration than the inactivated whole virus vaccines, 333 and S protein showed the least eosinophil infiltration among them either with or without formulated 334 with alum. Our studies find that the RBD can elicit far less immunopathology than even the S protein. 335 Similar to what was seen for the whole virus vaccine against SARS, lung eosinophil infiltration was 336 observed in mice immunized with MERS gamma irradiation-inactivated whole virus vaccine after 337 challenge with MERS-CoV (Table 1B) [34]. These findings further suggested that Alhydrogel \u00ae formulated 338 RBD219-N1 was a safer SARS-CoV vaccine than the ones listed in Table 1A . 339 Collectively, all the preclinical data suggested that SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 formulated with alum is a 503  504  505  506  507  508  509  510  511  512  513  514  515  516  517  518  519  520  521  522  523  524  525  526  527  528  529  530   TABLE   531 ",

However, an additional tag on a recombinant protein-based vaccine should be276    avoided because it can potentially trigger an undesired immune response. In our previous studies [20, 277 21], we have expressed and purified several tag-free recombinant RBD constructs in yeast using a 278 scalable process and discovered that the yeast-expressed RBD219-N1 induced a stronger RBD-specific 279 antibody response and a high level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice when formulated with 280 Alhydrogel \u00ae , and thus, a very promising vaccine candidate. In this study, we conducted for the first time281    an efficacy study in which we screened several different yeast-expressed RBD proteins and compared 282 them to the S protein as a positive control. RBD219-N1 formulated with Alhydrogel \u00ae triggered higher 283 neutralizing titers than the other Alhydrogel \u00ae -formulated RBD constructs or the S protein; the RBD219-284 N1 formulated with Alhydrogel \u00ae immunized mice were fully protected with 100% survival rate. The 285 RBD219-N1 construct was further selected for adjuvant screening and adjuvant dose-ranging studies.286 287 Before testing different adjuvants, we investigated the immunization routes (s.c. and i.m) for RBD219-N1 288 adsorbed to Alhydrogel \u00ae by evaluating the IgG antibody responses (Supplementary Figure. 1A), 289 neutralizing antibody titer against SARS pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV infections (Supplementary 290 Figures. 1B and 1C). It was found that both immunization routes were able to induce high titers of specific 291 IgG and neutralizing antibodies against infections of SARS pseudovirus in ACE2/293T cells 292 (Supplementary Figure.1B) and live SARS-CoV in Vero cells (Supplementary Figure.1C). Although the 293 antibody responses induced through the s.c. route were significantly higher than those through the i.m. 294 route, the i.m. route was selected for subsequent adjuvant optimization because i.m. injection of the 295 vaccines containing adjuvants has less chance to induce adverse local effects than s.c. injection[26] and 296 the majority of the clinically used vaccines are administered via the i.m. route [27]. 297 298 The superiority of the RBD219-N1 vaccine antigen to the S protein was reflected both in terms of eliciting 299 neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity, and that the alum-adjuvanted RBD219-N1 resulted in 300 little to no cellular or eosinophilic immunopathology compared to either the S-protein or an M59-like 301 adjuvant-formulated RBD219-N1 vaccine. With regards to the former observation, it was previously 302 shown that removal of immune-enhancing epitopes located outside the S-protein RBD domain may result 303 in an immunogen, which is less likely to induce immunopathology [11, 28]. This finding led to the initial 304 selection of the RBD as a vaccine antigen [29]. With regards to adjuvant selection, alum prevented or 305 reduced immune enhancement, a finding that confirms a previous observation for doubly inactivated 306 virus, viral-like particle vaccines and S protein[8]. For example, Tseng et al. reported that mice immunized 307 with alum-formulated virus-like-particle and inactivated virus vaccines showed less immunopathology 308 than the non-adjuvanted vaccines. Such findings provided the basis for suggesting that eosinophilic 309 immunopathology may occur through mechanisms other than Th2 immunity [30, 31]. 310 311 To understand the mechanisms of potential immunopathology linked to SARS vaccines, it's been shown 312 that high levels of eosinophilic immunopathology were observed with modified vaccinia virus Ankara-313 based vaccine platform vaccines,[2-7] and this vaccine platform was found to induce both Th1 (IFN-314 gamma, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, 315 TGF-beta) upon infection, causing severe infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes into 316 the lung. These pieces of evidence suggest that Th2 is not the sole factor but rather a mixed Th1 and Th2 317 response is responsible for the immunopathology. Additionally, it was found that IL-6 was shown to have 318 a prominent role in SARS-CoV-induced immune enhancement [7] in experimental animals, as well as in 319 lung pathology in SARS patients [32]. The prominent role of IL-6 in host Th17 immune responses suggest 320 that this pathway might also comprise a component of coronavirus vaccine immune enhancement[",
