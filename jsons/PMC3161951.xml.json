Influenza virus (along with Coxsackie B, adenovirus, echovirus and cytomegalovirus) has long been a recognized cause of myocarditis. Myocarditis can manifest in varying severity, ranging from a mild rise in myocardial enzymes to presenting with profound cardiogenic shock. Previous studies investigating influenza pandemics have confirmed multiple organ involvement on autopsy, including myocarditis and pericarditis. A pandemic caused by the H1N1 type influenza virus has been a topic of great interest of late. Treatment with osteltamivir shortened the period of infection. To date, only one study has explored the association of myocarditis in H1N1 infection in children. This highlighted that there should be a high index of suspicion for myocarditis in children with H1N1 influenza A infection. It emphasized the importance of early detection and aggressive management. Timely intervention with circulatory support was said to perhaps decrease morbidity and mortality, with potential for a favorable cardiac prognosis [1].",

Her C reactive protein (CRP) level was raised, with a mildly raised white cell count. A chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed consolidation and collapse of the left lower lobe. Arterial blood gas levels taken at the time were consistent with a severe type 1 respiratory failure. As a result of her severe hypoxia, she was electively intubated and ventilated. In view of her deteriorating status, her baby was delivered by emergency Caesarean section with no immediate post-operative complications.

Many obstetric health care workers often lack knowledge regarding the safety and importance of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Misinformed or inadequately informed health care workers may represent a barrier to influenza vaccine coverage of pregnant women. This lack of knowledge among the health care workforce takes on added importance in the setting of the H1N1 2009 swine-origin influenza pandemic [22]. Inactivated influenza vaccine can be safely and effectively administered during any trimester of pregnancy. No study to date has demonstrated an increased risk of either maternal complications or adverse fetal outcomes associated with inactivated influenza vaccination. Moreover, no scientific evidence exists that thimerosal-containing vaccines are a cause of adverse events among children born to women who received influenza vaccine during pregnancy [23]. Maternal influenza immunization is a highly cost-effective intervention at disease rates and severity that correspond to both seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics. These findings justify ongoing efforts to optimize influenza vaccination during pregnancy from an economic perspective [24].",
