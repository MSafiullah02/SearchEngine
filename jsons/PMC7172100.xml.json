The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) defines FN as a temperature \u226538\u00b0C with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500 cells/microlitre (less than 0.5 x 109/L). This neutrophil cut-off was chosen because the risk of overwhelming sepsis increases as the ANC drops below 0.5 x 109/L. Several guidelines propose more complex definitions, for example a single fever of \u226538.3\u00b0C; a temperature of \u226538\u00b0C for more than one hour; or two episodes of fever of more than 38\u00b0C within a 12 h period. The ANC cut-off can also vary between 1.0 x 109/L and 0.1 x 109/L. Prolonged FN is neutropenia with co-existent fever lasting for more than five days, which increases the risk of invasive fungal infections.",

The emergence of antibiotic resistance makes FN particularly challenging.

Equally, febrile and systemically unwell cancer patients with a normal ANC should also be treated for serious infection because of possible qualitative immunosuppression.

Anaemia and thrombocytopenia can be corrected with transfusion, but neutropenia in particular poses a significant danger to the patient. Neutrophils form the body's major defence against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infection. Neutrophils phagocytose microbes and eradicate them via several methods, including production of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogen-containing vacuole; fusion of neutrophil granules containing various antimicrobial mediators to the vacuole; and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Neutrophils also assist in generating fevers by releasing endogenous pyrogens in response to infection, but in the absence of neutrophils, epithelial cells can release cytokines which cause fever.",
