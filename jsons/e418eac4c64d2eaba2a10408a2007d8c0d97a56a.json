The potential reasons could be related to our inclusion criteria, i.e. all critically ill children with acute respiratory disease. It is worth noting that 2009, the year with the emergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza, was excluded from our analysis due to missing data, which provided better analyses and comparison of respiratory virus activities for the nonpandemic years. When comparing the clinical management of the different respiratory viruses, the risk of intubation for admissions with parainfluenza virus was significantly higher than the admissions with RSV and Rhinovirus/enterovirus. There have been only a few studies looking at the impact of parainfluenza virus infection in the critically ill children (23, 24) . Given that the severity of illness did not differ significantly among the three viruses at the time of the PICU admission, specific pathogenicity of each virus such as the higher likelihood of laryngotracheitis with parainfluenza virus infections might have led to the higher rate of endotracheal intubation. There was a significant increase in the number of invasive ventilation days with Rhinovirus/ enterovirus versus RSV.

Differentiation between Rhinovirus and enterovirus is performed only by request from the clinicians. Thus a positive Rhinovirus/enterovirus result includes a broad range of viruses, which generally causes mild upper respiratory infections in healthy populations. A retrospective cohort study which includes all patients admitted to PICUs with respiratory illness and Rhinovirus/ enterovirus at three urban centres reported a mortality rate of 2.1% (11/519) which was similar to our findings of 3.3% (18) .

Our ability to identify mixed virus infection was limited before the use of molecular diagnostic tests in November 2005, and some cases with a predominant virus detected by DFA from their nasopharyngeal swabs might not have molecular diagnostic tests performed prior to March 2009 if no throat swabs or lower respiratory samples were submitted for testing. Another limitation is that PRISM III only represented the initial assessment at PICU admission. The higher rate of antibiotic use in admissions with multiple viruses might suggest that more of these patients presented to the PICU with a more severe clinical picture; nonetheless, the exact antibiotic indications could not be obtained from our database. A recently performed systematic review concluded that there was no difference in clinical disease severity between single infection and coinfections of respiratory viruses; however, in their subgroup analysis, the authors found a higher mortality in preschool children with viral co-infection as compared to other age groups (6) . A small cohort study reported that infants with severe bronchiolitis due to co-infections had higher odds to be admitted to the PICU than did those with a single virus; as in our study, the most dominant combination of the viruses was RSV and Rhinovirus (26) . A single centre-study investigating the effect of viral coinfection in a two-year retrospective study, in which the diagnostic panel did not include Rhinovirus/enterovirus, reported that the most common co-infections were with adenovirus and RSV and found a significantly higher severity in patients with viral co-infections (7) .

To minimise this potential bias, antibiotic usage was used as a proxy, but some of the antibiotics would have been started just as empiric treatment.
