This study evaluated the efficacy of mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant (Cryocide20) for inactivation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) on various environmental surfaces. MRSA and VRE were applied to hard and soft surfaces (glass, steel, tile, carpet, and cotton fabric), allowed to dry, and exposed to a uniform mist application of the disinfectant solution. After 1 hr of contact time, the residual disinfectant was neutralized, and the bacteria were recovered and enumerated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. Reduction of both test bacteria was observed on most of the hard and soft surfaces tested. Log 10 reduction of the organisms tended to be higher on steel, tile, and carpet than glass or cotton. Overall, these results suggest that mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.",

            "text": "Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ) has many of the characteristics desired in a surface disinfectant (e.g., broad efficacy against different organisms, compatible with many surfaces). However, it is poorly stable in solution. When stabilized with carbonate and maintained at a high pH (>8.5), chlorine dioxide is present primarily as chlorite, a more stable form. (22) Although chlorite has nearly the same oxidative capacity as chlorine dioxide, the germicidal potential of chlorite is not well known. If stabilized chlorine dioxide is acidified, however, ClO 2 gas will be regenerated. This is an important consideration for application, since chlorite is a respiratory irritant but has no established exposure limit, while ClO 2 has an occupational exposure limit of 0.1 ppm. Stabilized chlorine dioxide products that have been activated are reported to be efficient bactericides, with previous studies showing as little as 0.75 mg/L of available chlorine dioxide capable of at least a log 10 reduction = 4 for vegetative bacteria. (23) (24) Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are another promising surface disinfectant. QACs are a class of surface active agents that have varying degrees of antimicrobial activity. QACs may have good germicidal properties against bacteria, fungi, and lipophilic viruses at levels as low as 10 to 50 mg/L and may inhibit bacterial growth at lower levels. (25, 26) However, some QACs can be inhibited by environmental factors, such as protein load and water hardness, although as a class, twin chain QACs are considered to have a high tolerance for such inhibiting factors. (25) In addition to the choice of disinfectants in terms of their effectiveness against various microorganisms and compatibility with various environmental surfaces, method of application is another important factor in surface disinfection. There are two methods commonly used to evaluate the efficacy of disinfectants on hard surfaces: (1) the (AOAC) use-dilution method and (2) the germicidal spray products test. (27) Unfortunately, neither of these standardized methods is adequate to replicate delivery of disinfectants by mist-or fog-based applications. In this study, a novel mist-chamber method was developed for the evaluation of fine-mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and QAC-based disinfectant (Cryocide20; R.P. Adam Ltd., Selkirk, Scotland) for disinfection of MRSA and VRE on various environmental surfaces.",

A Devilbiss model DV151 atomizer (Sunrise Medical HHG, Inc., Somerset, Pa.), driven by house air, was used for delivery of the Cryocide20 disinfectant (or sterile deionized water for controls) to the test chamber from the tapered terminus of the chamber. The atomizer provided a conical dispersion pattern and had a forward spray distance FIGURE 1. Disinfection chamber.

(24, 28) Previous surface disinfection studies have typically been concerned with the efficacy of disinfectants to inactivate microorganisms on glass and stainless steel carrier surfaces, consistent with the standard AOAC International methods. (27) However, glass and stainless steel may not adequately represent the range of surfaces in the real world that may require disinfection. In this study, disinfection of MRSA and VRE was evaluated on a range of hard (glass, stainless steel, and floor tiles) and soft surfaces (carpet and cotton fabric). No significant difference was found in the level of disinfection observed between different surface types (p > 0.05). Surface type differences were potentially occluded by the variability between inter-trial results for particular surfaces. The log 10 reduction factor for MRSA was generally greater than or equal to that of VRE, regardless of surface type. However, only the log 10 reduction difference on carpet was significant (p = 0.004).",

(27) Cryocide20 can be easily applied by several application methods, including fine mist-and fog-based applications. These application strategies have shown to be an efficient means for delivery of disinfectants to a broad range of environmental surfaces. (29) Unfortunately, current disinfectant testing methods do not allow adequate evaluation of the efficacy of the disinfectants when delivered by these methods. (27) In the use-dilution method, the entire carrier surface is immersed in excess disinfectant, whereas in the germicidal spray test the carrier surface is applied in a coarse spray.
