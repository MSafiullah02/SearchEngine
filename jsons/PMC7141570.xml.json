            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN; EC 3.4.11.2) is a membrane\u2010bound zinc metallopeptidase involved in the extracellular metabolism of biologically active peptides. APN is expressed in many tissues, with highest levels in intestinal and kidney brush border membranes [1], but also found in lower quantity in brain, lung, blood vessels, and primary culture of fibroblasts [2]. Furthermore, APN has been shown to be identical to human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13 [3], and has been reported to act as a major receptor for transmissible gastroenteritis virus [4] and for human coronavirus 229E [5]. APN exhibits a broad specificity for peptides with an N\u2010terminal neutral or basic amino acid, and has been shown to be involved in enkephalins and nociceptin catabolism in the central nervous system [6, 7] and to participate in the enzymatic cascade of the renin\u2010angiotensin system in brain and peripheral organs by cleaving angiotensin III [8]. All these findings make this enzyme an interesting target for possible therapeutic applications [9]. The knowledge of the precise distribution of APN is therefore crucial to investigate its physiological role. Few studies on the localization of APN have been done exclusively by using antibodies. In brain APN has been reported to be essentially located on blood vessels [10, 11, 12], a distribution which is hardly reconcilable with its peptide metabolizing role. Radioactive inhibitors have the advantage over antibodies to label the active site quantitatively in all tissues and species, and to reveal even low levels of a biological target [13]. However, it is essential to verify that the labeled inhibitor has a good affinity and is specific for the enzyme, as zinc metallopeptidases have many active site features in common [14]. Another advantage of radioactive inhibitors is that their in vivo distribution can easily be followed after different routes of administration [15], an important factor, considering the potential clinical applications of such molecules.",

In this study we have characterized the binding of its radioiodinated form, [125I]RB 129, using either rat brain membranes or recombinant APN expressed in COS\u20107 cells. The binding was tissue concentration dependent, reversible and saturable. Saturation analysis indicated that [125I]RB 129 binds with high affinity to a homogeneous population of non\u2010interacting sites in rat brain membranes and COS\u20107 cells transfected with APN wild\u2010type. Thus, Scatchard plots were linear, and Hill plots had slopes which were not significantly different from unity. From rat brain homogenates [125I]RB 129 bound to a single class of binding sites with a K\nd value of 3.4 nM and a B\nmax of 722 fmol/mg of protein. Specific binding was high, being almost 95% at the K\nd value. In binding studies using recombinant APN expressed in COS\u20107 cells [125I]RB 129 had a K\nd of 0.9 nM and again a high specific binding (\u223c92% at the K\nd value). Recently, E350 has been characterized as a critical residue involved in the N\u2010terminal amine binding site of APN [19]. The mutation E350A led to a non\u2010measurable specific binding. This result was expected, as E350 is essential to stabilize aminophosphinic inhibitors in the S1 subsite, and the binding data are in good agreement with the enzymatic assay demonstrating that this mutated APN shows an activity at least 10 000\u2010fold lower than that of the wild\u2010type APN [19]. This reinforces the argument that E350, found highly conserved in zinc metallopeptidase by sequence comparison, interacts with the amino group of substrates and inhibitors and participates to the exopeptidase specificity of aminopeptidases.",

These more than 10\u2010 and 15\u2010fold lower affinities of both inhibitors observed in binding studies are very likely due to the lower selectivity of RB 38A and Phe\u2010thiol inhibitors for APN as compared to the aminophosphinic inhibitors in regard to the various other aminopeptidases present in rat brain membranes. This is strongly supported by the results obtained with the recombinant APN expressed in COS\u20107 cells, which could be considered as a partially purified enzyme preparation. Thus, Phe\u2010thiol inhibitor inhibited the [125I]RB 129 binding on COS\u20107 cell membranes transfected with APN with K\ni value of 7.7 nM which parallels that found in enzymatic assay (K\ni=12.1 nM).",

            "text": "The iodinated APN inhibitor [125I]RB 129 was synthesized (i) to determine the level of membrane\u2010bound APN in different brain regions after various pharmacological treatments [25, 26, 27, 28]; (ii) to perform a localization of the enzyme in the central nervous system and at the periphery of different species. The use of such an inhibitor for autoradiography has advantages over enzymatic assay which is very imprecise or immunological methods for which quantitation could be hampered by differences in the tertiary structure and epitope presentation of the enzyme in various tissues, as shown in the case of angiotensin converting enzyme [29, 30]. Furthermore, although the primary sequences of APN from different species are highly conserved [4, 31, 32, 33, 34], it cannot be excluded that the enzyme appears to be differentially glycosylated not only in different species but also in different tissues of the same species, as already observed for neprilysin, another zinc metallopeptidase (NEP) [35], which might affect its recognition. Moreover, the use of 125I needs only short exposure times to obtain autoradiograms, and due to its high specific activity offers the possibility of a precise visualization of the enzyme in various tissues. As a preliminary experiment, we have visualized APN in the rat intestine with [125I]RB 129 and found a distribution at the level of the brush border in good agreement with previous studies reporting immunolabeling of APN in intestinal membranes, where its physiological function appears to be the hydrolysis of dietary peptides [36, 37].",

Furthermore, this radiolabeled compound could be modified to generate new dual inhibitors of NEP and APN, which both are involved in enkephalin degradation, offering the possibility to follow its bioavailability after different routes of administration, an important factor considering the potential clinical application of such molecules (review in [9]). In vivo displacement could also be performed to study the physiological modulation of enkephalin pathways by others neuromodulators.\n",
