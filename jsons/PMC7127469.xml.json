The NRTIs have emerged as important therapeutic agents for the development of anti-HIV drugs [1], [2], [3], [4]. The NRTIs after intracellular phosphorylation to their active triphosphate form by cellular kinases [5], act as competitive inhibitors with respect to the dNTP substrates. These molecules when incorporated by HIV-1 RT in the growing template/primer, cause chain termination [6], [7] since they lack 3\u2032-OH group, which is necessary for chain elongation and thus, they inhibit HIV-1 RT [8], [9]. Despite their tremendous utility, nucleoside analogues may cause serious cellular toxicity by interacting with human DNA polymerase \u03b3 [10], present in mitochondria, which results in mitochondrial dysfunctions. Thus NRTIs, show many side effects [11], [12], [13]. In addition to this, four more significant obstacles currently limiting the clinical application of nucleoside analogues are oral absorption, cellular uptake, short half-life and viral resistance [14]. So, there is a need for new nucleoside mimics and their prodrugs to overcome the limitations. We have already reported several nucleosidic [15], [16] and non-nucleosidic molecules [17] with significant antiviral activities.",

Thus, this molecule being a dideoxynucleoside is expected to act as NRTI against HIV-1 RT enzyme.

During conversion of 1\u20132, the elimination of C3\u2032-mesyloxy group was effected through intramolecular displacement by attack of carbonyl group of thymidine at C2, which resulted in formation of 2,3\u2032-anhydronucleoside intermediate. This result was well in accordance with the literature data. It is suggested that under this condition, phthalimide ion is introduced into the \u2018down\u2019 (ribo) configuration [19]. The 3\u2032-phthalimide derivative 2 was treated with methanolic methylamine, which through methanolysis and aminolysis resulted in formation of compound 3\n[20]. Reaction of 3 with formic acid and aqueous formaldehyde (40%) yielded 4. In this reaction, formaldehyde used was the source of methyl groups, while formic acid supplied the hydrogens involved in the reduction. This treatment also removed the DMT group from compound 3. As expected, the UV absorption spectra of all intermediates were similar to that of thymidine, while dissimilar R\nf values showed that all these changes took place in the sugar moiety and not in the aglycon part [19].",

However, the prodrug 6 showed good activity against VSV with SI value equal to 8. The enhanced reactivity of free amino acid ester prodrug may be attributed to its electronic activation by the positively charged amino terminus at physiological pH, which derives support from the fact that l-amino acid esters enhance nucleoside absorption via human peptide transporters (hPEPT1) of active transport system [28], [29]. Furthermore, since bone marrow progenitor cells lack this active transport system for amino acid, prodrug 6 is expected to show reduced toxicity at bone marrow level. Therefore, compound 6 has potential to be developed as an effective antiviral agent against VSV.",

However, this molecule showed almost no anti-HIV activity and rather proved cytotoxic. This might be expected because of introduction of dimethylamino group at 3\u2032-C of ribose moiety, which did not show any interaction with HIV RT during molecular docking experiments. The lead molecule 4 was designed because of its similarity with AZT, but it completely failed in fulfilling the objectives.

This molecule showed some striking differences with AZT \u2013 the approved anti-HIV drug as shown in Table 2\n. The physiochemical studies suggested that both the molecules \u2013 AZT and DMAT, followed Lipinski\u2032s rule of five but they have marked differences in their molecular volume, total polar surface area (TPSA) and log \nP values. Similarly, the docking experiment also showed quite different patterns of their interaction with HIV-1 RT (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n). Although DMAT formed one more H-bond with HIV-1 RT than AZT, the crucial interactions as shown by AZT were missing in the case of DMAT. The azido function on AZT formed three H-bonds \u2013 one with Arg72 and two with Asp113 (the amino acid constituting the dNTP-binding site), whereas the dimethylamino function on DMAT formed no H-bonds at all. Similarly, the H-bond formed by phosphate moiety of AZT (and TTP as well) with Val111 was missing in the case of DMAT. However, the aglycan part in both the molecules formed two H-bonds with Arg72 through oxo group and \u201cO\u201d atom in the sugar ring. The stability of DMATTP\u2013RT complex was also less than that of AZTTP\u2013RT or TTP\u2013RT complexes as is evident from their minimization energies. A comparative account of interaction of TTP, AZTTP and DMATTP and stability of their respective complexes with HIV-1 RT has been shown in Table 3\n. Thus, the physiochemical and docking studies suggested the possible reasons for inactivity of the lead molecule and its prodrugs.",
