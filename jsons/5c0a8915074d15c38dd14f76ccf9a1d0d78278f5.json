            "text": "The book Electron Probe Microanalysis in Biology summarizes the methods of X-ray microanalysis and their applications in biological sciences. The introductory chapter by D. A. Erasmus is followed by the chapter by J. C. Russ on the physical basis of electron excitation of X-rays and subsequent analysis. Properties of the older wavelength-dispersive system and the new energy-dispersive method are explained and advantages and disadvantages are compared. The author does not describe the technical construction of the systems, but th~s is certainly not a shortcoming of this chapter. The third extensive chapter by J. A. Chandler summarizes information concerning the application of X-ray microanalysis in transmission electron microscope to the study of ultrathin biological specimens, including data up to 1977. The author summarizes data concerning the frequency of 17 specimen preparation methods used, frequency of analyzed 17 elements in the specimens and types of analyzed animal and plant specimens and types of tissues. A very extensive bibliography concluding the chapter includes 270 references yielding information about the type of the used analyser, description of preparation of specimens, the kind of analyzed elements and type of biological objects. In the fourth chapter A. J. Morgan, T. W. Davies and D. A. Erasmus describe and compare methods used for preparation of biological specimens for microanalysis. A table summarizes literature concerning losses of the analyzed elements (in %) in tissues when utilizing different fixation methods, washing procedures, dehydration and embedding of objects. The fifth chapter by T. C. Appleton is also very interesting. It describes methods of ultramicrotomy and its use in X-ray microanalysis of biological objects. In the sixth chapter I. D. Bowen and T. A. Ryder summarize the application of X-ray micro. analysis to histoehcmistry and evaluate precipitation and staining techniques of mieroanalysis of endogenous substances, techniques of mieroanalysis of exogenous substances and methods for detecting enzymatieally released reaction products. In the last seventh chapter the authors H. O. Garland, J. A. Brown and I. W. Henderson describe X-ray analysis as applied to the study of renal tubular fluid samples.",

Although this book can and obviously will serve as a monograph on the given problematies, it is --judging mainly from the literature references --predominantly an original work. The intention of the author is characterized by the subtitle. While the occurrence of reserve compounds is a relevant character already applied to lower plants, it does not hold for the Tracheophyta. Professor Czaja tried to fill this gap. His book has three parts based on authors' previous publications. The methods of investigation of starch grains and their classification are briefly dealt with in the first part. The results of investigations on the occurrence of starch in the seeds and in vegetative organs (the root and the stem) in plants belonging to individual genera arc presented in the second part of the book, often continuing immediately the data of Hegnauer's Chemotaxonomy. In the third part, the author discusses his results in connection with the systematics of vascular plants in general and with regard to the occurrence of starch in particular taxons.",

However, next publications in this field must respect especially the following two points of view: The book is focused on basic problems and general principles of pollination ecology and in comparison with the preceding edition which appeared in 1971 it is considerably revised. The introductory chapters briefly survey the history and technical aspects of pollination research, draw comparison with spore dispersal in lower plants and outline the main ecological features of pollination in gymnosperms. The greater part of the book is devoted to various aspects of pollen transfer in angiosperms. This part begins with a description of the structure and function of angiosperm flower and with examination of some aspects of reproductive barriers operating against hybridization. This is followed by the discussion of problems of pollen transfer by abiotie vectors. The fairly large matter of complicated interactions of plants with biotic vectors is divided into 5 chapters entitled Principles, Primary attractants, Secondary attractants, Structural blossom classes and Animals as pollinators. The next five chapters examine some evolutionary, taxonomical and applied aspects of pollination ecology such as the developments to abiotie vectors, autogamy, apomixis and to vegetative propagation, development of flowers in relation to the mode of pollination, relation of pollination ecology to speeiation and to bioeenoses, etc. To illustrate the general principles of pollination ecology some case histories are described in detail.

Everyone working at or interested in any branch of virus research must go through this book in order to get a quick information of the recent virological progress. More than 500 new chemical compounds are introduced each year. Of these a crude estimate indicates one or two dozen might be mutagenie. In order to identify them it is necessary to develop simple and effective screening methods. The 5th volume in the Plenum Press series on chemical mutagens presents the following methods for detecting mutagenicity: 1) Analysis of body fluids including alkylation of macromolecules (Legator et al.) ; 2) Use of yeasts as an assay system for industrial mutagens (Loprieno); 3) Heritable translocation test in mice (Generoso et al.) ; 4) Detection of mutational damage in fern populations (Klekowski); 5) Analysis of chromosome aberrations in mammahan germ ceils (Brewen, Preston); 6) Mammalian spot test in mice (Fahrig); 7) Chick embryos for detecting environmental mutagens (Bloom); 8) Specific locus mutations in mice (Ehling) and 9) Induction of sperm shape abnormalities in mice and humans (Wyrobek, Bruce). All chapters contain procedures for mutational analysis, testing protocols, strain and races recommended for testing and advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods. The volume is appendixed by the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The aim of this law is \"to regulate commerce and protect human health and the environment by requiring testing and necessary use restrictions on certain chemical substances\".

The Proceedings concern three major areas in research of the recombinant DNA molecules --Scientific Developments and Practical Applications, The View of Industry, International Cooperation. The first part including 23 contributions, deals thoroughly with experimental results obtained in the leading world laboratories studying the process of genetic engineering at the most important levels (structural and functional characterizations of different vectors and their recombinant derivatives, their replication and expression in hosts of prokaryotie or eukaryotic origin, improvement of E. coli transformation method, cloning of specific fragments of eukaryotio genomes), and with individual projects presently carried out and using this approach (structure and molecular organization of individual genes --ovalbumin, immunoglobulin, ribosomal RNA, nitrogen fixation etc.), which illustrate where basic research in this area stood in 1978 and what are the potential practical applications to the benefit of man and his life. The second part, with four comprehensive surveys, covers the present state of the possible uses of the recombined DNA molecules in the production of different biopreparations, thus documenting the unprecedented interest of various industries both in research results themselves and in industry participation in research activities (production of enzymes important for the industrial section, polypeptide hormones, antibiotics etc.).",

            "text": "Another concise textbook in plant science has been added to the welcome series edited by the Institute of Biology, London. The author was rather successful in keeping himself at the edge between plant physiology and ecology, since although the physiological approach is fundamental in plant ecology, it is still difficult enough to reach an appropriate proportion in information taken from so many branches of sciences which are to be considered in environmental problems.The selection of topics for different chapters is in general up to date, paying attention e.g. to the physiological background of ecosystem approach, to competition mechanisms, and exp]:aining the niche conception, lqevertheless, the textbook deals in some cases more with the problem of ecology itself (e.g. the chapter on atmosphere and soil) than with the physiological basis of the interaction between plants and environment. Still, the booklet yields an authoritative insight into the present knowledge on a very \"sensitive\" boarderline between environmental science and plant physiology, which undoubtedly forms the utmost background of ecology. The endeavour of the authors and the editor is to be highly appreciated. This is a very comprehensive textbook, simply, authoritatively and clearly defining the feld of ecology, yielding (1) the principles of terrestrial, freshwater and marine animal and plant ecology, (2) bringing a stimulating review of methods used in applied ecological analyses, and (3) a wise chapter on the problems of different kinds of ecological stress and (4) discussing basic ideas of selected ecological cycles and pathways of matter. In addition, an extensive appendix with conversion factors of units encountered in ecological research (26 pp.) and a really authoritative glossary of terms frequently used in ecology (89 pp.) are included. I like the book very much. It is clear, excellently written, especially from the didactic point of view. The applied approach seems to be very positive even (or especially) for those interested in more theoretical problems of ecology. Being intentionally restricted to the selected problems, facts, ideas and research tools, de Santo's textbook f,,lfille excellently its task.JIRINA SLAV~KOV~. (P#'a~)",
