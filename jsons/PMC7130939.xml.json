It is one of the smallest countries in the world with a land area of 697.1 km2, 193 km of coastline and a population of 4.185 million.1 It is very densely populated. Singapore has been independent from Malaya for 40 years. It is an urban, developed republic with a president and a parliament. The ethnic distribution is made up of Chinese (76.2%), Malay (13.8%), Indian (8.3%), Eurasian and other races (1.7%).2, 3 It typifies a multicultural and multiracial society. In 2003, 7.7% of the population was aged at least 65 years. With developed standards of healthcare such as an average life expectancy of 78.4 years and infant mortality rate of 2 per 1000 births, at an affordable 3% of the gross domestic product for the last three decades, Singaporeans are getting good value healthcare for their money.1, 3, 4\n",

Medical care is increasingly sophisticated, diseases are detected earlier and investigative procedures have multiplied and become more costly. The Singapore model of healthcare financing has attracted much interest with favourable comments. It exemplifies an evolving public-private partnership.5 In the 1980s, the Singapore government re-examined from first principles the role of the state in healthcare financing and provision and concluded that the British style National Health System (NHS) was not a viable option. The model in use is primarily based on the philosophy of individual responsibility, backed by government subsidies and the principle of co-payment.6 It comprises:1.Tax funding: where government subsidy is substantial in areas such as preventive care, public health, outpatient and public hospital services;2.The \u201c3M\u201d (i.e. Medisave, Medishield and Medifund).3, 4, 6\n(a)\nMedisave. This is a national medical savings scheme, introduced in 1984, which helps individuals put aside part of their income into an account to meet their future personal or immediate family's hospitalisation, ambulatory surgery and certain outpatient expenses.(b)\nMedishield. This was introduced in 1990. It is a low cost catastrophic illness insurance scheme, designed to assist with medical expenses resulting from major or prolonged illnesses, for which the Medisave account would not be sufficient. Medishield operates on a co-payment and deductibles system to avoid problems with pre-paid insurance. Premiums for Medishield can be paid with funds from the individual's Medisave account.(c)\nMedifund. This endowment fund, set up in 1993, assists financially needy Singaporeans with their medical expenses. It represents a safety net for those who are unable to afford the already heavily subsidised charges, despite Medisave and Medishield. This fund was established with an initial capital of SGD 200 million. Capital injections are made when budget surpluses are available.\n3.\nOther health insurance. This can be personal or through the employer. It is very popular with professionals in certain companies, but does not represent the answer to national health funding.4.\nFee for service. This practice is mainly in the private sector, which is beyond the reach of many and thus cannot function on its own. As the economy improves, this group and sector expands with it.\n",

The air-conditioning units were turned off. Nebulisation for patients were stopped and only metered dose inhaler with spacer were allowed. This aimed to reduce the chance of aerosolisation of droplets.15 Once such a patient had been sent to the ED, the ambulance crew had to thoroughly clean the ambulance. Contaminated but reusable patient care equipment was placed in biohazard bags for cleaning and disinfection.

One of these is a tertiary women and children's hospital. The largest and oldest is Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a 1700-bed tertiary referral centre with 33 disciplines. The ED at SGH has an annual attendance of 120 000. All EDs in Singapore use a common national triage system known as the Patient Acuity Category (PAC) Scale. There are four priorities, P1\u2013P4 in this system. Triage in all EDs are done entirely by trained nurses. Some of these EDs, including SGH, have 24-h consultant cover. The rest of the doctors working in the EDs are made up of emergency medicine trainees (or residents), surgical, medical and family medicine trainees, as well as general medical officers. Direct admission is possible to many disciplines, but for some consultation must be made with the on call specialist doctors. At three of these hospitals, there are neurosurgical and cardiothoracic specialists available round the clock. SGH also houses the Burns Intensive Care Unit and Burns Centre for the whole island. Paramedics can bypass other hospitals and send specific cases directly to the most appropriate hospital rather than the nearest hospital. As Singapore is small and transport distances are similar to most hospitals, issues relating to delays based on bypass decisions are uncommon.",

Five years later, structured academic postgraduate training programmes were introduced. In 1990, a specialist training committee for EM was appointed to oversee the development of advanced training locally. Several areas of subspecialisation were identified, i.e. Emergency Cardiac Care, Emergency Prehospital Care, Emergency Paediatrics, Emergency Toxicology, Emergency Trauma Care, Disaster Medicine and Observation Medicine. EM trainees had to do three years of Basic Training (similar to the USA Residency Programme), after which they are eligible to take the MRCS (Accident and Emergency Medicine and Surgery) from the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh (RCSEd).18 Locally, there is also now the Masters in Medicine (EM) which is taken together with the MRCS examination, held in Singapore once a year, in collaboration with the RCSEd. Following these examinations the candidates have to go through another 2 years as Advanced Specialist Trainees. At the end of this there is a formal structured exit interview with the Academy of Medicine, Singapore. Once this exit interview is cleared trainees are eligible to get onto the Specialist Register in Singapore. Currently there are 50 registered emergency physicians in Singapore. There is also a Singapore Society of Emergency Medicine (SEMS). The speciality is gaining popularity and the achievements in EM in Singapore can help provide a model for the future development of EM in other similar environments.",
