A parametrized waveform replacing the GR phasing coefficients \u03c6 a with \u03c6 a (1 + \u03b4\u03c6 a ) (a = k, kl) is employed for the test [8]. By construction, the deformation parameters \u03b4\u03c6 a are identically equal to zero in GR, while in a modified theory of gravity one or more of these parameters can deviate from zero.

This restricted suite of tests can still be expected to detect a deviation away from GR by finding statistically significant offsets away from zero in one or more of the PN deformation parameters [6, 8] .",

            "text": "It is, however, incorrect to use the results from the singleparameter tests to constrain a specific modified theory of gravity, for two reasons. Firstly, any deviation from GR inferred for a particular PN coefficient cannot be attributed uniquely to a breakdown of GR at that PN order. This is because the waveform is largely degenerate in the PN coefficients. Consequently, deviation at a particular PN order can be captured by deformation of the coefficient at a different PN order. Hence a deviation in one or more of the PN coefficients in a set of tests does not necessarily give any fundamental insight into the true nature of the underlying theory of gravity. Secondly, if the single-parameter tests are all consistent with GR, the widths of the posterior distributions of the PN coefficients cannot be used to constrain the parameter space of modified theories of gravity. This is due to the expectation from effective field theoretic arguments, that deviations from GR, in a specific modified theory of gravity, show up starting from a certain PN order (see, for instance, [18, 19] ). Therefore, to map the PN deformation parameters to the free parameters of a specific modified theory of gravity it is necessary to perform the most general multiparameter test. In other words, single-parameter tests would lead to an underestimation of the errors and hence yield bounds that are more stringent than what one might infer with multiparameter tests.",

Such tests are crucial to set reliable constraints on the parameter space of modified theories of gravity. Specifically, we demonstrate that multiband observations of a subclass of stellar-mass BBHs by LISA and CE would provide a unique opportunity to carry out the multiparameter test of PN theory. Combining the low-frequency sensitivity of LISA with the high-frequency sensitivity of CE helps in lifting the large degeneracies that prevent the use of multiparameter tests in either of these observatories. To demonstrate the advantage of multiparameter tests using multibanding we simulate a stellar-mass population of BBHs that obey the mass-, rate-and redshiftdistribution inferred from the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo. In a companion paper [23] , we will discuss intermediate-mass BBHs as another important class of sources for multiband, multiparameter test of GR, although the bounds from stellar-mass BBHs are far better than their intermediate-mass counterparts [23] .",

The primary black hole masses are assumed to follow a power-law distribution with the powerlaw index \u03b1 = 1.6 (i.e., p(m 1 ) \u221d m \u2212\u03b1 1 ) in the mass range [5, 100]M while secondary masses are uniform in the same mass range [34] . We assume the binary components to possess spins which are aligned or anti-aligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector. This assumption is consistent with the fact that none of the BBHs detected during the first and second observing runs of LIGO/Virgo showed evidence for spins misaligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum. The Kerr parameter of the companion black holes are drawn from two different distributions: (1) a uniform distribution in the range [0, 1] and (2) a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1. 3G detectors will be able to observe stellar-mass BBH mergers up to the epoch of the formation of first stars. The question, is what fraction of events detected by CE will have LISA counterparts. This joint population will be limited by the SNR in the LISA band. In Fig. 1 we plot the SNR distribution in LISA for this population. As expected, only a small subset of the population will have an SNR greater than 4. Such events will have an SNR of at least 2000 in CE, facilitating a very accurate measurement of the binary parameters, which in turn helps in digging the signals out of the LISA background noise. (See the Supplement for a discussion on the detectability of stellarmass BBH signals in LISA with an SNR threshold as low as 4.) We find that among the hundreds of thousands of stellar-mass BBH merger that would be observable by CE in one year, \u223c200 would cross this threshold and permit multiband, multiparameter tests of GR. These \u223c200 BBHs would spend roughly 4.5 days to 7 weeks outside the LISA band before entering the CE band and eventually merge.",

[37, 42] we also add a prior matrix \u0393 p to the Fisher information matrix, \u0393 (0) , in order to account for certain properties of the signals that we assume. Specifically, we assume that the priors on the spin magnitudes and the phase of coalescence as \u0393 p \u03c7 1 \u03c7 1 = \u0393 p \u03c7 2 \u03c7 2 = (0.5) \u22122 and \u0393 p \u03c6 c \u03c6 c = (\u03c0) \u22122 , respectively and all other elements of the prior matrix are set to zero. The Gaussian prior on spin magnitudes is a good approximation to the low-component spins of the BBHs reported in Ref. [2]. The prior on \u03c6 c is somewhat adhoc, but helps the Fisher matrix to be better conditioned. We have verified that this choice of prior does not alter our conclusions reported in this paper. We now invert the resulting Fisher matrix given by \u0393 \u03b1\u03b2 = \u0393 0 \u03b1\u03b2 + \u0393 p \u03b1\u03b2 to deduce the error bars.

As we increase the number of PN coefficients that are simultaneously tested, starting from the Newtonian order, the 1\u03c3 upper bounds on them are presented in the figure. For instance, the filled circles are the bounds where only one PN deformation parameter is estimated at a time, whereas the octagons denote the bounds when all the eight parameters are simultaneously estimated. In the eight parameter case, all the parameters are measured with an accuracy \u223c20%, of which the first three may be measured with an accuracy better than 1%, whereas the first two PN coefficients may yield bounds \u223c0.1%. Hence multiband observations of stellar-mass BBHs would permit us to test modified theories of gravity, which predict deviations at orders below 3PN to a precision less than \u223c 1%.",

The bounds on 0PN and 1PN deformation coefficient from 2-parameter estimation case are \u223c0.01%. The inclusion of the 1.5PN deformation coefficient results in a sudden worsening of the bounds by an order of magnitude. This may be understood by noting that 1.5PN is the order at which spins first appear in the phasing formula. Adding a deformation parameter at that order, that is completely degenerate with spins, adversely affects the overall parameter estimation, which gets reflected in the bounds on the first two PN coefficients. The gradual worsening of the bounds as we go to even higher multiparameter tests is simply due to the increasing degeneracy brought in by each of the additional PN deformation parameters. It can be seen that even in the era of 3G detectors we cannot obtain meaningful constraints with multiparameter tests. As is evident from the figure, for golden binaries in CE-binaries that have the smallest error for the multiparameter tests-the errors on \u03b4\u03c6 a , are \u223c100% only for a = 1, . . . , 4; if we vary more than four parameters at a time then the errors on PN coefficients with a 0 are larger than 100%. In a year's time CE will observe a handful of such golden binaries and the joint error that one can obtain by combining golden binaries will still not be significantly smaller. Consequently, ground-based detectors alone cannot break the degeneracy among different PN coefficients. The same is true with LISA observations of supermassive BBHs. Even with a golden supermassive BBH we can perform the multiparameter test with only five parameters and LISA is not likely to observe more than a handful of such binaries over a 5 year period.",

From our systematic study of a representative set of systems, we have also found that even for the best case scenario, observations of supermassive BBHs in the LISA band or stellar-or intermediate-mass BBHs in the CE band would not be able to place constraints as good as the one reported here. Hence multibanding would, perhaps, be the only way to carry out this test which in turn is necessary to make meaningful constraints on the parameter space of modified theories of gravity. As LIGO and Virgo detect several more BBHs in the future observing runs, the merger rate and the mass distribution would be more tightly constrained which is likely to further tighten the bounds derived here making this test an excellent science case for multiband observations. acknowledge the Swarnajayanti grant DST/SJF/PSA-01/2017-18 DST-India.

This contracted volume of the search space decreases the number of templates by a factor of 10 29 compared to a blind search [43] .

This may be thought of as tests of alternatives to GR where up to a particular PN order, the predictions of both GR and its alternative match but beyond that they deviate. This may be naturally motivated from an effective field theoretic perspective where the deviations may appear when the binary dynamics proceeds beyond a certain scale of velocity or field strength [18, 19] . Figure 4 shows the results for multiparameter tests starting from 3.5PN through 0PN order. For instance a three parameter test, would correspond to the case where only the last three PN deformation coefficients (3.5PN, 3PN log and 3PN) are simultaneously estimated and so on. The most significant result here is for the 7-parameter test for which it is found that the last seven PN parameters can be bounded with 10% using the population we simulated earlier. This means, if we assume that the leading Newtonian coefficient is not modified, the simultaneous constraints on the remaining seven are of the order of a few percent. Since a modification to the Newtonian phasing would be at odds with the extremely stringent bounds on them from binary pulsar observations [47] , this is the most general test we wish to carry out from this perspective. Fig. 4 also shows the best bounds that CE and LISA alone could yield from their golden binaries.

Any Fisher matrix obtained from an event corresponding a particular multi-parameter test, that does not meet this criterion is dropped from our analysis and is not used to obtain the combined multiband multiparameter bounds. Shown are combined 1\u03c3 bounds on various PN coefficients starting from 3.5PN through 0PN in the inspiral phase of the signal while measuring many of them together at a time. Different types of markers symbolize how many PN coefficients were constrained simultaneously. For example, ' ' represents 'one PN coefficient at a time', '\u2228' represents 'two PN coefficients at a time', and so on. The filled diamonds and pentagons are bounds obtained with CE and LISA, respectively, on the last four and five PN coefficients from their respective golden binaries. The total masses of the CE and LISA golden binaries are 200 M and 6.6 \u00d7 10 5 M , both binaries are 1 Gpc away and have component spins \u03c7 1 = 0.6, \u03c7 2 = 0.5. The figure represents results for the BBH population having Gaussian spin distribution (we get similar estimates for a uniform spin distribution).",
