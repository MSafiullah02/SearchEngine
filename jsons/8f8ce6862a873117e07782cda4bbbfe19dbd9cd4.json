We assessed and formulated strength-opportunity (SO), weakness-opportunity (WO), strength-threat (ST), and weakness-threat (WT) strategies for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted an in-depth analysis and identified the highest-priority policies. These are: reshaping the emergency system (SO1); adding health emergency departments to universities and other institutions (WO2); adjusting the economic structure and strengthening international and domestic linkages (ST2); and strengthening public intervention in responding to public health emergencies (WT1).",

            "text": "In 2003, the SARS epidemic had a huge impact on China's economy and society, especially the lives of ordinary people. At the time of the SARS outbreak, there were no specialized health emergency agencies, established plans, systems, mechanisms, or applicable legal framework. Faced with severe challenges, the Chinese government responded by developing a health emergency system based on a \"one plan, three systems\" strategy, and continued to strengthen basic health services [9] . \"One plan\" refers to the emergency plan, and \"three systems\" refers to establishing and improving (1) emergency response systems, (2) mechanisms, and (3) legal systems. In the face of the rapidly advancing COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese health emergency system can play a role in the guiding, coordination, prevention, and control of this epidemic (Table 1) . In 2005, a health emergency management system based on \"unified leadership, comprehensive coordination, classified management, hierarchical responsibility, and territorial management\" was established [13] In 2006, established a rapid response mechanism for disease prevention and control, and a national and provincial or regional emergency response mechanism for public health emergencies; In 2016, a joint prevention and control mechanism was established, and health emergency coordination mechanisms at different levels in adjacent areas were established [14] Emergency Multisectoral cooperation is complex. China has a centralized and unified administrative leadership system. In response to major public health emergencies, the administrative execution of each department is robust. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, China has launched a joint prevention and control mechanism, which has played an important role in defining each department's response. The Department of Trade needs to increase the supervision of key trading places, especially places involved in the trade of poultry and wild animals, such as farmers' markets, bazaars, and supermarkets. The Department of Transport needs to implement traffic control measures in key places such as stations, airports, wharfs, and closed public transport, and to ensure that necessary measures, such as ventilation, disinfection, and temperature monitoring, are observed once a suspected case of COVID-19 is identified. The Human Resources and Social Security departments need to strengthen their handling of labor relations during the epidemic period, protect employees' wages and benefits, and make arrangements for employees to take paid leave. On this leave, according to a type of subsidy standard, each person will be given a subsidy of 29 or 43 U.S. dollars per day [18] . The Education Department requested that schools establish a current ledger for teachers and students, and has postponed the start of the spring semester, which was maybe scheduled to start in April or May 2020. The national government has allocated 4.4 billion yuan to the COVID-19 prevention and control subsidy fund to support various agencies performing epidemic prevention and control related work; an additional 500 million yuan has been allocated to Hubei Province, and the Finance Department and the Medical Insurance Department have identified further costs associated with the investigation and outpatient medical treatment of the COVID-19 epidemic. Policies to cover the medical expenses of patients diagnosed in other places should also be put in place. In the event of a major illness, health insurance covers some medical expenses in accordance with regulations; the personal burden will be subsidized by the finances. The required funds are paid in advance by the medical provider, and the central government reimburses the medical provider at 60% of the actual expenses incurred [19] .",

Through these efforts, the resumption of work and production has reached 40%, but the demand for protective clothing, masks, and other materials remains high.

Some people are \"playing boldly\" and being defiant in the face of the epidemic, refusing to wear masks, and laughing at those who do. Some people take their children into crowded places and travel long distances without protection. Some departments are not sensitive to the epidemic situation, are afraid of trouble, and do not implement the requirements of occupational exposure protection or fever screening, as well as other prevention and control requirements. Others believe that epidemic prevention is a matter for the health and disease control departments, and their response to the \"joint prevention and joint control\" movement is slow. These phenomena reveal that there are still loopholes and shortcomings in the public health system, and that health literacy and disease prevention knowledge in the general population requires strengthening.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent CoV from an independent evolutionary branch [23, 24] . It belongs to the same beta coronavirus genus as the original SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is genetically distinct from these two related viruses, with a nucleic acid homology of <80%. The virus that is currently known to be the most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a Yunnan chrysanthemum bat and shares a nucleic acid homology of 96% [25] . Therefore, the chrysanthemum bat may be the original source of SARS-CoV-2, although the direct source of the current epidemic has not been found. Chinese researchers have been quick to respond to the epidemic by initiating new research on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, clinical outcomes, and laboratory and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, carrying out research and development of diagnostic tests and candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Multiple studies published in the world's top journals, including a series of articles that were published in the Lancet less than 2 months after the start of the epidemic [26] [27] [28] [29] to promote identification of the source of infection, the duration and mechanisms of human transmission, and clinical knowledge about the diseases, show the need for more in-depth research on COVID-19.",
