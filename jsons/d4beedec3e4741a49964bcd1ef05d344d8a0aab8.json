            "text": "To the Editor: Airway management is clinically challenging. Along with a proper environment and the use of personal protection equipment, several modules have been proposed to enhance safety during advanced airway management for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection. 1, 2 The process of intubation is a high-risk period for aerosol-based transmission, especially when clinicians are in close proximity to the patient's airway. 3, 4 We therefore developed a novel, low-cost, easy-to-make protection tent to provide a protective barrier between clinicians and the patient, containing possible aerosol during intubation.",

We used 2 L-shaped, solid-iron frames as a skeleton, set along both sides of the patient's head and upper chest. The frames were covered with a transparent, plastic film, which was made of polyvinyl chloride, as a tent. Scissors were used to cut the film to create holes as necessary, allowing physicians and nurses to put their hands through the holes and perform procedures.",

The film is disposable, and the frame is reusable after being sanitized with 70% ethyl alcohol or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. 5 Second, compared with rigid hoods or chambers, the tent provides a more flexible and expansible space and thus allows clinicians to operate various types of intubation equipment, such as video laryngoscopes (Figure, B) .",
