Protected areas are often delimited by soft and porous frontiers such as rivers or roads, and consequently, animal movements between protected areas and their periphery occur in both directions (Ferguson & Hanks, 2010). The interfaces between protected areas and surrounding communal lands are thus hotspots of potential interactions between people, their livestock and wildlife, often typified by human\u2013wildlife conflicts including threat to human life (Packer, Ikanda, Kissui, & Kushnir, 2005), livestock depredation by carnivores (Kolowski & Holekamp, 2006), crop destruction by wild herbivores (Hoare, 1999), competition for shared resources (Mishra, Van Wieren, Ketner, Heitkonig, & Prins, 2004), hunting or illegal poaching (Nicholls, 2015) and disease transmission (Jones et al., 2008). Encroachment of human activities into wildlife habitats may have enhanced pathogen transfer between wildlife and domestic animals (Daszak, Cunningham, & Hyatt, 2000) and may have caused the emergence of several recent zoonoses (e.g., Ebola (Maron, 2014), MERS coronavirus (Azhar et al., 2014)). These interface areas raise significant public health and conservation issues globally (Woodroffe, Thirgood, & Rabinowitz, 2005).",

The use of space by cattle in African rangelands is likely to reflect a trade\u2010off for cattle herders between potential benefits (i.e., access to resources such as water and grazing) and potential costs, including risks of predation by wild carnivores (Kuiper et al., 2015), disease transmission from wild reservoirs (de Garine\u2010Wichatitsky et al., 2013) and fines or confiscation of livestock illegally grazing inside protected areas. These potential costs may thus influence husbandry decisions, such as to when and for how long livestock are allowed to graze within protected areas (Alexander & McNutt, 2010). These decisions are likely to influence the different disease hubs, from wild to domestic hosts or inversely, through direct interactions, the environment and/or vectors evolving in wild or anthropized areas. Further, the presence of large carnivores is likely to affect habitat use by herbivores (Valeix et al., 2009) and may indirectly influence where interactions and consequently disease transmission between sympatric hosts occur (Proffitt, White, & Garrott, 2010).",

We assessed the seasonal dynamics of the risk of FMD infection in a cattle population (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) living at the periphery of a protected area in Zimbabwe. FMD is a contagious disease caused by a virus characterized by complex transmission processes (Haydon, Woolhouse, & Kitching, 1997). Here, we explored the influence on FMD virus transmission to cattle of (1) the frequency at which cattle use the protected areas, (2) interspecific contacts between cattle and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) which is assumed to be the main reservoir of FMD (Thomson, Vosloo, & Bastos, 2003) and (3) intraspecific interactions among individuals from different cattle herds. At this interface, domestic cattle and African buffalo are at risk of predation by the African lion (Panthera leo). We eventually explored the potential modulating influence of lions\u2019 presence on interspecific interactions or on cattle incursion inside the protected area and thus the risk of disease transmission.",

The edge of the national park is unfenced and thus permeable to movements of wild and domestic animals. HNP and surrounding protected areas host a large diversity of wild herbivore species (Chamaille\u2010Jammes, Valeix, Bourgarel, Murindagomo, & Fritz, 2009) and are characterized by a relatively high abundance of large carnivores (e.g., 3.5 lion/100 km\u00b2 (Loveridge, Hemson, Davidson, & Macdonald, 2010)). The mosaic of land use at the periphery of HNP is composed of Forestry Commission areas (Sikumi Forest), which are protected areas designated for sustainable use of natural resources, and communal areas. Activities in communal lands consist of subsistence farming with small\u2010scale livestock production. At night, cattle herds are usually confined to enclosures located close to owners\u2019 houses. During the day, they are generally driven by a herder to grazing areas and water points. Entering national parks is forbidden throughout the year in Zimbabwe (Lindsey, Romanach, Tambling, Chartier, & Groom, 2011). However, the use of natural resources within the Forestry Commission area is more flexible, with permission granted to local communities for limited collection of deadwood and to a certain extent a tolerance for grazing within 3 km of the boundary.",

Overall, the vegetation is characterized by a woodland\u2013bushland semi\u2010arid savanna (Rogers, 1993). NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) extracted from Landsat images (Landsat\u20107 2012/04/29, i.e., end of rainy season) was 13% in the buffer, whereas it was 5% in the first 3 km of communal lands, suggesting higher vegetation productivity and biomass in the buffer (Figure 1b, Google earth picture Cnes/Spot image 2012). Furthermore, the vegetation is less fragmented and less overgrazed in the buffer than in communal lands. Available surface water for animals is scattered over the landscape (Figure 1a), but water point density is three times higher in the buffer (0.25 water points per km\u00b2) than in the adjacent communal lands (0.08 water point per km\u00b2; including pans and boreholes). The mean annual rainfall is ~600 mm, with three seasons commonly distinguished: the rainy season (mid\u2010November\u2013March), the cold dry season (April\u2013July) and the hot dry season (August\u2013mid\u2010November).

The cattle population in this area is estimated at 4,850 heads (see Appendix in (Miguel et al., 2013) for more statistics). Three of four villages were selected for their proximity to the protected area (see Chezhou, Sialwindi and Mabale in Figure 1a). In each cattle herd, the serological survey was conducted on 10 randomly chosen ear\u2010tagged adults (males and females). Ten animals represent almost 80% of a herd in this agrosystem (see (Miguel et al., 2013), for more statistics). The 110 cattle were blood sampled every 4 months when possible during the 16\u2010month study period. ELISA commercial test (PrioCHECK\u00ae FMDV NS) was applied on each sample to detect FMD antibodies. The ELISA commercial test detects the antibodies produced following natural viral replication, irrespective of the virus serotype, but does not detect vaccine antibodies (Moonen, van der Linde, Chenard, & Dekker, 2004). The specificity and sensitivity of the test are estimated to be 98.1% and 97.2%, respectively (Brocchi et al., 2006). We assumed that a transition from seronegative to seropositive status between two sampling sessions reflected the occurrence of a natural infection event between the two sessions.",

The dependent variable was binary: the serological status of an individual (cattle) either changed or remained unchanged during a time interval. The statistical models used were generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with binomial error structures. In this analysis, the elementary statistical unit was defined by an individual cattle and a time interval over which serological status transition could be documented for that cattle. Because the same individual could produce more than one pair of successive serological records, and because individuals were aggregated in herds, a herd random effect was included to account for pseudoreplication. Finally, because not all cattle were sampled at each of the five sampling sessions and consequently the time between two sampling sessions varied from 4 to 8 months, a complementary log\u2013log link function was used and the log of the length of the time interval was included as an offset in the models (Fortin, Bedard, DeBlois, & Meunier, 2008). Goodness of fit was assessed with the Pearson overdispersion test (Bolker et al., 2009). Model selection was performed using Akaike information criterion (Bolker et al., 2009; Burnham & Anderson, 2002).

GPS were scheduled to acquire one position per hour during the day from 06:00 to 18:00. Seasonal home ranges were determined using the movement\u2010based kernel density estimation method (Benhamou & Cornelis, 2010) (Cumming & Cornelis, 2012), allowing the visualization of seasonal cattle distribution in the landscape.

Three GPS UHF collars were fitted to three adult females in this buffalo herd. The spatial overlap between the collared buffalo was high with a mean of 81.6% (range: 79\u201384%), suggesting that the three collared individuals were reasonably representative of the movements of the main buffalo herd frequenting the study area but not necessarily of smaller splinter groups or resident bachelor herds. GPS positions were taken on an hourly basis 24 hrs a day. A potentially infective contact was considered to occur whenever a cattle's position was recorded within 300 m of a buffalo's position and 15 days after the buffalo's position had been recorded. The chosen time window corresponds to the conservative assumption that the virus can survive in the environment for 15 days under the semi\u2010arid climatic conditions characteristic of the study area (Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2010; Miguel et al., 2013). The spatial window was chosen by considering that the collared buffalo represented the herd, that GPS precision was imperfect, and that the collared individuals may have moved during the hour between two consecutive positions. An analysis of the sensitivity of contact frequency to the size of the spatio\u2010temporal window used for defining contact is presented in (Miguel et al., 2013). Contact rates were computed as the number of contacts relative to the number of cattle\u2013buffalo position pairs to make unbiased contact rate comparisons and take into account the seasonal variation in GPS acquisition rates and number of GPS collars deployed. Because these rates were extremely low, they were multiplied by 108. The resulting index is hereafter referred to as the \u2018cattle\u2013buffalo contact index\u2019.",

Based on interviews, seasonal networks of cattle herd contacts at water points were described. In these undirected networks, each node represents a cattle herd and ties connect herds using the same water points during the same season. A node\u2010level connectivity index, the degree, was computed for each herd and each season. The degree is the number of ties of a node with all the other nodes (i.e., the number of herds which are in contact with a focal herd through shared water points). Two network\u2010level indexes, the connectivity and the density, were also computed. The connectivity measures the social cohesion of a group at a general level. A network is said \u201cconnected\u201d (connectivity equalling 1) if there is at least one path between every pair of nodes in the network.

This contrasts strongly with the pattern of lion incursion. Lion incursion index showed no clear seasonal variation but large short\u2010term variation (Figure 3c). This pattern resulted in an autocorrelogram with positive autocorrelation persisting only over a few days implying that current lion incursion frequency could inform future lion incursion frequency over a couple of days only (Figure 3f).

Nevertheless, our results showed a pronounced seasonality in FMD incidence peaking during the rainy season and coinciding with the period when cattle most frequently entered the protected forestry land. In this pathoecosystem, our study of incidence (and reversion see (Miguel et al., 2013) for more details) patterns demonstrate that the FMD antibodies are not lifelong and that an individual can be infected several times during the year. The social network analyses on cattle owner herding strategies showed that network connectivity and density were higher in the rainy season, but these variables were not the most influential to explain the incidence of FMD in cattle. We cannot rule out that our sample sizes were not large enough but so far intraspecific interactions do not appear to be the main drivers of the FMD dynamics in cattle at wild/domestic interface. The seasonal dynamics of FMD can neither be explained by the contacts between cattle and buffalo. Indeed, contacts between cattle and buffalo occurred mainly at the end of the hot dry season (i.e., November) in the vicinity of water points when surface\u2010water availability strongly constrains herbivore distribution (Redfern, Grant, Biggs, & Getz, 2003), compared to later in the rainy season when buffalo are more evenly distributed over the landscape. Additionally, these interspecific contacts, potentially resulting in infection, were also limited because the seasonal fluctuations of buffer incursion frequency by cattle and buffalo were asynchronous. Cattle frequently used the buffer zone from the second half of the hot dry season, throughout the rainy season and until the beginning of the cold dry season, while buffalo frequently used the buffer zone mainly during the cold dry season but avoided it over most of the rainy season. Such asynchronous patterns could partially result from spatial avoidance behaviours by buffalo triggered by perturbations associated with the presence of cattle herders in the protected area. Spatial separation between cattle and buffalo has previously been assessed in the W regional park in West Africa through the analysis of animal localization data collected during two aerial surveys in 2002 and 2003 (Hibert et al., 2010). This previous study detected, although in only one of the two study years, spatial separation between cattle and buffalo could result from buffalo avoiding cattle. However, in the present as well as in this former study, other drivers, such as resource distribution within the protected area and the communal area, are probably at least as important in determining seasonal pattern of cattle and buffalo incursion frequency in the different landscape compartments.",

            "text": "The time\u2010lag between cattle\u2013buffalo contacts (i.e., hot dry season) and the peak of FMD incidence (i.e., rainy season) is not likely to be accounted for by long seroconversion time. Indeed, FMD antibodies are produced shortly after infection (Grubman & Baxt, 2004) and no significant lag between infection and serological conversion was expected (i.e., no longer than 14 days). There are three alternative and non\u2010exclusive interpretations for this lag. The first is that virus survival in the environment is high enough for cattle to become infected when they use areas where buffalo have been present some time before (i.e., longer than the 15 days used for the temporal window that defines direct or delayed contacts). The second is that wild ungulate species other than buffalo, such as impala (Aepyceros melampus), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), could play a role as secondary reservoirs of the FMD (Thomson et al., 2003) or function as bridge populations that generate epidemiological links between buffalo and cattle populations (Caron, Cappelle, Cumming, de Garine\u2010Wichatitsky, & Gaidet, 2015). Under such scenarios, the frequent cattle incursions during the rainy season in areas used previously or concomitantly by reservoir and/or bridge population(s) could explain the peak of FMD incidence in cattle population during that season. Unfortunately, our study was not designed to be able to assess the role of other herbivore populations in the epidemiology of FMD. Nevertheless, these other herbivore species were present in the study interface and could have potentially played a role in disease transmission. Thirdly, the study did not allow us to assess the role of small unmonitored buffalo groups (such as bachelor herds) (Caron, Cornelis, Foggin, Hofmeyr, & de Garine\u2010Wichatitsky, 2016) or single adult animals (van Schalkwyk et al., 2016) that could also play a significant role in FMD dynamics.",

            "text": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that predators could modulate the likelihood of encounters between livestock and wild herbivores, and ultimately influence pathogen transmission between them. We did not detect any significant and reasonable relationship at short term between cattle and lion. However, lions and cattle are frequently using the same area. More interestingly, the analysis of incursion frequency time series revealed that lions made frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, suggesting a potential attraction effect of buffalo on lions. If this is the case, it is noteworthy that lions use the buffer not only shortly after buffalo had used it (3 days), but also after longer time\u2010lags (up to 40 days). The buffalo autocorrelogram showed weak but significant positive autocorrelation persisting over 40 days. Conversely, buffalo, which are the main prey for lions in the Hwange ecosystem (Davidson et al., 2013), did not use the buffer zone when it had been occupied by lions a few weeks before, which could suggest an avoidance of lions by buffalo but at a temporal scale that is not traditionally considered. Such results (even if the value of the correlations are not very high) pave the way for future research to test the scenario whereby lions and buffalo are engaged in a \u201cpredator\u2013prey space game\u201d at the landscape scale as revealed in other species (Johnson, de Roode, & Fenton, 2015), and encourage for the investigation of several temporal scales. Under such scenario, lions might play a role of natural barrier between sympatric species by reducing the spatio\u2010temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the buffer zone, and consequently the likelihood of direct or indirect contacts, which will ultimately influence FMD transmission (Proffitt et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Our results showed that cattle entered the buffer of the protected area almost exclusively during the rainy season in this part of the Hwange system as it was observed in similar ecosystem in Zimbabwe (Kuiper et al., 2015). This pattern is informative at three levels. First, the rainy season coincides not only with the season when resources (grazing and water) are the most abundant and allow access to a larger home range but also with the ploughing and the crop growing and harvesting period in communal areas. The amount of agricultural work required and the necessity to keep cattle herds out of growing fields encourage unmanned cattle herds to graze away from communal lands and hence more into the buffer zone (Murwira, 2013). After harvest, cattle are fed on crop residues in fields during the early dry season which constrains cattle movements to areas closer to villages and further from protected areas as it was described in (Kuiper et al., 2015). Second, we might have expected the resource availability (vegetation and surface water) in protected areas to be attractive for cattle owners during the dry season. At this time, surface water is scarce and grass is rare or trampled in the vicinity of homesteads and driving cattle inside the protected areas would be an opportunity (Prins, 1996; Zengeya, Murwira, & de Garine\u2010Wichatitsky, 2011). However, the buffer was not used by cattle during the dry season. This suggests that cattle owners decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land, maybe to avoid the risks of infection, not only from FMD virus but also tick diseases which are a burden for farmers, and/or predation in the protected area. It has been shown that cattle are more frequently killed by lions during the wet season than during the dry season. Indeed, \u201cseasonal use of protected areas during growing season increases vulnerability of cattle to lion depredation\u201d (Kuiper et al., 2015). The optimized strategy for cattle herders at the wildlife/livestock interface might be to decrease the likelihood of livestock depredation by avoiding the use of protected areas when the constraints in communal lands are acceptable (i.e., when the crop period is finished). Considering that the risk of being fined for entering the protected area is the same throughout the year, we assume that this effect could not explain the seasonal variation of the cattle buffer use. Third, conversely to the intuitive idea that the dry season is a risky period for disease transmission, as it was shown in similar ecosystems with a lesser predation pressure (Caron et al., 2013; Miguel et al., 2013; Zvidzai, Murwira, Caron, & de Garine\u2010Wichatitsky, 2013), our study shows that the rainy season is the key season for foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease transmission and potential exposure to predation.",

The risk of pathogen spillover between sympatric host populations is restricted to limited areas at specific seasons and predators could mitigate interspecific disease transmission. A better picture of the pathoecosystem would require an understanding of how cattle owners take their herding decisions and according to which clues and perceived risks: disease, predation or risk of fines? The integration between biological and social sciences is therefore necessary to better understand and manage the risk of disease transmission at complex human/livestock/wildlife interfaces which are hotpots in the context of emerging infectious diseases (Woolhouse & Gowtage\u2010Sequeria, 2005). Recently, Iverson and collaborators showed interesting results on the integration of community\u2010based/participatory surveillance to delineate disease outbreak and predict transmission risk (Iverson, Forbes, Simard, Soos, & Gilchrist, 2016).",
