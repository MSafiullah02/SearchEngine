The virus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract, targeting type-2 pneumocytes and, to a lesser extent, bronchiolar epithelium (Atanasova et al., 2008). Although PRCV infection is typically sub-clinical or mild under experimental conditions, it can contribute to naturally occurring respiratory disease, when combined with other viruses or bacteria (Brockmeier et al., 2002).",

Based on previous experiments, the dose of LTA from S. aureus (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was 200 \u03bcg/kg bodyweight, which, in contrast to a 20 \u03bcg/kg dose, results in moderate to severe inflammatory cell infiltration (see Appendix A, Supplementary material, Table 1). In both doses there was no extensive cytokine production. The cytokine concentrations were higher than controls, but comparable with previous data using LPS alone and lower than in PRCV\u2013LPS-inoculated animals (Van Reeth et al., 2000, Van Gucht et al., 2006).

Pure LTA appears to be a less potent cytokine-inducer than LPS and the ability of LTA to induce higher concentrations of cytokines has been attributed to its synergistic interactions with other bacterial components such as muramyl dipeptide (Yang et al., 2001), peptidoglycan or host macromolecules such as glycosphingolipids (Meron-Sudai et al., 2008).",

Our finding that up to 81% of the total BALF cells were neutrophils in LTA-inoculated pigs indicates that this bacterial component may be highly effective in activating pulmonary neutrophil infiltration in this species. A similar rapid influx of neutrophils into the milk of cows occurs following inoculation of 10\u2013100 \u03bcg LTA into the mammary gland (Rainard et al., 2008). In this study the neutrophil influx was accompanied by increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of chemokines like CXCL-2 and IL-8. In the current study, the finding that the total BALF cell count and neutrophil percentages in the PRCV\u2013LTA pigs were slightly, though not significantly, lower than in LTA-inoculated animals during the first 8 h PI may possibly have been due to their more rapid and effective destruction in the dually-inoculated pigs (Medan et al., 2002, Fuchs et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2008).",

            "text": "We did not investigate the possible role of histamine in the pathogenesis of disease in our experimental model. In addition to mast cells, neutrophils can produce histamine during mycoplasma infection in mice (Xu et al., 2006). Histamine can interact with LPS in the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and of prostaglandin I2 and E2 by human endothelial cells (Tan et al., 2007) and can also increase the sensitivity of these cells to the effects of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through inducing the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4 (Talreja et al., 2004), IL-8 and IL-6 (Li et al., 2001). Furthermore, histamine-mediated respiratory disease closely resembles the pattern of clinical signs observed in our study (White et al., 1987, White, 1990).",

Leaving aside this speculation as to a possible role for histamine in our infection model, we can conclude that the severity of the induced disease was not linked to the effect of TNF-\u03b1, but most likely reflected an integrated, concerted interaction between the examined cytokines and possibly other (so far unidentified) mediators.",
