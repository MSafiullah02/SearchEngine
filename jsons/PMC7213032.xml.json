            "text": "In early December 2019, several unexplained cases of febrile illness with upper and lower respiratory symptoms including pneumonia were reported from Wuhan, China.[1] The epidemic has since spread to much of the world, having been labelled as a pandemic with over 1.3 million confirmed cases and 74,000 deaths worldwide (as on April 07, 2020). The agent responsible for this outbreak has been confirmed to be a novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV).[2] Similar coronaviruses have been reported to be responsible for symptoms resembling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndromes (MERS) in 2003.[34] Much of the pathophysiology of manifestations of 2019-nCOV infection has been attributed to interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, ubiquitously distributed across many human tissues including the nervous and musculoskeletal systems.[56] A report from Wuhan in China described fever in over two-thirds, dry cough in half and anorexia in over a third of the 214 hospitalized patients of 2019-nCoV infection.[7] Coronaviruses can however cause multiple systemic infections in animals.[89] The brunt of the 2019-nCov disease is borne by the respiratory system but reports of the epidemic from China distinctly bring out nervous and musculoskeletal symptoms and signs in a fair proportion.[710111213] This, added to the scale of the pandemic, invariably means that the neurological practice is likely to be severely impacted as a result of 2019-nCov infection. An overwhelming of intensive care units and of intensive care health workers as well as efforts to contain the pandemic have obligated of neurologists from curtailing routine health care facility visits of their patients, thereby disrupting their continuity of care to even redeployment in other departments to make up for the shortage of intensivists. Neurologists should therefore be apprised appropriately of 2019-nCov infection for the benefit of the patient community as well as their own professional advantage. Here, we review aspects of 2019-nCov that might be relevant to neurological practice.",

Some recent reports have emphasized hypospmia as a presenting manifestation of COVID-19 infection.[710111213] Overall, neurological manifestations were observed in 36% of the large series of 214 hospitalized patients from Wuhan, China.[7]",

Although 2019 nCoV infection can occur in any age group, people over 50 years are most often affected with the majority of hospitalized cases being over 60 years of age. Stroke along with other cardiovascular conditions were identified as premorbid conditions predisposing to 2019 nCoV infection.[111218] Moreover, 2019 nCoV-infected individuals with premorbid cerebrovascular disease are predisposed to more severe illness, requiring admission to the intensive care unit.[1219] Conversely, we did not find any evidence to suggest that 2019 nCoV illness modifies the manifestations, course and outcome of pre-existing neurological conditions.",

Also pertinent to consider is the temporary worsening during fever, of neurological status in individuals with multiple sclerosis with residual deficits or progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis may be warned of these phenomena, known as pseudo-relapses, and should perhaps be reassured that the neurological worsening would resolve as fever lessers. Another concern expressed by experts is the potential worsening of fatigue and muscular weakness because of myalgias and muscle necrosis associated with 2019 nCoV infection.",

Personal communication to one of the authors from neurologists in China confirms that, apart from rare seizures, there was no apparent worsening of seizure control in people with epilepsy during the Wuhan epidemic (Ding Ding, personal communication). The occurrence of febrile seizures in association with related viruses, Cov-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 has been previously reported.[22] One redeeming aspect of the 2019-nCoV infection is that does not seem to considerably affect the paediatric population. In both Wuhan, China and Italy, about or less than one percent in published reports were in the paediatric age group.[714] Hence, the occurrence of febrile seizures might not be a concerning aspect of 2019-nCoV infection. Of potential concern though is the worsening of seizure control with fever and systemic illness in certain types of epilepsies, or due to drug interactions, stress or simply due to the unavailability of anti-seizure medications. People with epilepsy are required to be counselled on all the above aspects.",

Professionals in neurological care including clinicians, neuropsychologists, neurophysiotherapists and neurophysiology technicians may have to deliver care under demanding circumstances with limited resources that are vital to their effective functioning. The dire shortage of personal protective equipment is one such example. Neurologists should certainly comply with administrative directives to halt routine outpatient care, yet at the same time, be involved in the continuity of care of their patients. This will require innovative methods of care provision. Tele-medicine is a great option and in hospitals in western countries, where it has already been operational, is providing a crucial alternative to face-to-face consultations. However, tele-medicine facilities are rather underdeveloped in our country. That being said, this is a great opportunity for policy-makers to accelerate the pace of development of tele-medicine in India. In the interim, neurologists should consider carefully offering telephonic consultations and in these consultations emphasize continuity of care for people with chronic neurological disorders. Needless to add, neurologists should be committed to promote health and should heed and promote all public health recommendations for the containment of 2019 nCoV. It is also possible that neurologists might have to be redeployed to other departments for providing patient care, should the 2019 nCoV infection epidemic acquire unprecedented scale.",
