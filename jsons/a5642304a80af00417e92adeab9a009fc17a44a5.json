Mucor circinelloides was isolated from yogurt samples and presumed to cause illness in >200 consumers Strongyloides stercoralis may lead to serious, life-threatening hyperinfection syndrome in patients with marked cellular immune defects following allogeneic allograft transplantation, albeit, this remains a rare complication in patients undergoing transplantation even in the endemic regions m These strains of human coronavirus may cause potentially serious lower respiratory tract disease in the immunocompromised host n L. donovani and L. infantum may lead to serious visceral leishmaniasis in patients with profound cellular immune defects; L. donovani is seen in Africa and Asia o These novel outbreak stains of coronavirus have been observed to cause serious illness in immunosuppressed patients and those with diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, or end-stage kidney disease p L. infantum is seen in Africa, Europe, Mediterranean, Central and South America q Systemic extrapulmonary infection including viral encephalitis along with viral pneumonitis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients has been noted to cause devastating and life-threatening illness r The incidence of campylobacter disease in AIDS patients is 40-fold higher than in the general population; patients with humoral and cellular immune defects are considered susceptible; it is important to recognize the serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, and reactive arthritis may follow acute infection episode in a small group of patients s VZV is rarely associated with systemic dissemination in patients with humoral immune defects or even those with mixed immune dysfunctions The emergence and global spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus has made empiric use of anti-staphylococcal penicillin's obsolete c Catheter-related bloodstream infection, extensive healthcare environment exposure and hospital-acquired pathogens, persistent mucositis, orointestinal or cutaneous hyper-acute and acute GVHD, and accelerated iatrogenic immune suppression including need for high-dose corticosteroids are salient factors that promote invasive bacterial infections during this period. Pretransplant colonization due to VRE, MRSA, or MDR GNB including MRD Pseudomonas, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and some food-borne fungi such as Fusarium spp., especially in transplant unit located in certain geographic areas, are thought to promote infections due to these pathogens d Hyposplenism after HSCT is a late complication and commonly attributed to late-onset acute GVHD, most frequently noted in patients with chronic GVHD. It is however important to recognize that a number of allogeneic HSCT recipients without clinical diagnosis of GVHD may have functional hyposplenism and are at risk for severe, systemic infection due to encapsulated bacteria e Indwelling prosthetic devices including intravascular access catheters; surgical drains; implanted prosthesis such as heart valves, joints, biliary, bronchial, urinary tract stents; and other various implantable surgical devices promote infections due to CoNS and Candida spp. that commonly colonizes the skin and genitourinary and orointestinal tracts f Listeria bacteremia and meningitis are rare complications in patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for PCP. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is 30-fold higher in HSCT recipients compared with persons without HSCT. As expected, patients undergoing allograft stem cell transplant are at a significant higher risk compared with those undergoing autologous HSCT (70 vs. 16 per 100 000 patients per year). In HSCT recipients Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen associated with bacterial meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus mitis; listeriosis may be rarely seen g Increasing frequency of multidrug-resistant strains to fluorinated quinolones and regional high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing GNB including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has seriously curtailed treatment options for such infections. Enterobacteriaceae include Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella spp., Shigella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter h CNS nocardiosis is difficult to distinguish from brain toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, aspergillosis and other neurotropic clear (hyaline) and black mold infections, and CNS lymphoma i Nonfermentative gram-negatives include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii, other Acinetobacter spp., Alcaligenes and Achromobacter spp., and emerging cases of Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Inherent or acquired drug resistance is a major concern in selection of effective empiric therapy for pathogens in this group, which may either lack the drug target site or produce extended-spectrum hydrolyzing enzymes aginst a variety of commonly used antimicrobials; these bacteria may also exhibit phenotypes with reduced expression of outer membrane porins and/or heightened expression of efflux pumps among other mechanisms for antimicrobial drug resistance j Orointestinal mucositis increases the risk of CDAD and so does exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials and possibly antineoplastic chemotherapy-induced alteration in hosts' intestinal protective anaerobic microbiota It is standard to provide prophylaxis for HSV and VZV during preparatory conditioning regimen and continue during the early post-HSCT period. Prophylaxis may have to be extended in patients with acute GVHD, cancer recurrence, patients undergoing high-risk transplantation procedure, and those with primary or secondary allograft compromise s HHV-6 high-grade viremia by DNA analysis has been associated with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, although viral interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis is not an uncommon disease attributed to HHV6 infection following allogeneic HSCT. HHV6 may also present as limbic encephalitis with subcortical temporal lobe seizure activity presenting as memory loss and insomnia. Febrile partial or complete myelosuppression and/or skin rash should alert the physicians regarding HHV6 as a potential treatable cause of secondary stem cell allograft loss. Viral gastroduodenitis, colitis, and pericarditis are other clinical manifestations attributed to HHV6 infection in this vulnerable population. An association with post-HSCT HHV6 viremia with delayed monocyte and platelet engraftment, increased platelet transfusion requirements, risk for high-grade GVHD, and allcause mortality needs further evaluation t Early CMV low-grade viremia was observed by the use of ultrasensitive nucleic assays, within 3-4 weeks after high-risk allogeneic stem cell graft transplantation u The incidence of adenovirus disease ranges from 3% to as high as 47% in high-risk pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. Patients undergoing T-cell-depleted stem cell grafts and those with acute graft-versus-host disease are also at increased risk for severe life-threatening adenovirus disseminated disease, which is a well-recognized complication in patients with persistent peripheral blood lymphocyte counts of <300 cells/mm 3 . Infection involves respiratory (viral pneumonitis), gastrointestinal (colitis, including hemorrhagic colitis) tracts, and hepatitis;patients may present with posttransplant hemorrhagic cystitis. Adenovirus dissemination represents severity of underlying immune defect and is seen in 10-20% of patients with end-organ viral disease, except in patients with adenovirus cystitis, where disseminated adenoviral disease is seldom observed John Cunningham virus (JCV)-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an uncommon disease in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In a report from Israel, 20 of 40 patients (24%) with JCV reactivation had persistent viremia after receiving myeloablative and nonmyeloablative pretransplant conditioning. PML was diagnosed in two patients with persistent JCV viremia, 96 and 127 days after HSCT. Advanced age was a significant predictor of JCV reactivation; 70% of these allogeneic HSCT recipients with persistent viral reactivation had died. Identifying high-risk patients with persistent JCV reactivation, especially those with incremental levels of viremia, may benefit from reduced drug-induced immune suppression for prevention of JCV leukoencephalopathy. PML continues to remain a devastating, albeit rare posttransplant infectious complication. Artesunate, an antimalarial drug that showed potent ex vivo activity against HHV-6, however, clinical response to artesunate in HSCT recipients with JCV-PML, has not been encouraging ac Candidemia is seen in patients with severe pre-engraftment neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 cell/microliter) that extends longer than 5 days. The increase in non-albicans Candida spp. is mainly due to C. glabrata, although patients following HSCT are also at risk for C. krusei infection. Emergence of echinocandin resistance among clinical C. glabrata isolates is concerning. For patients with C. parapsilosis infection, it is recommended to use antifungal drugs other than echinocandin class. The emergence of MDR Candida auris infections in transplant population makes selection of empiric anti-yeast therapy more challenging ad Genetic susceptibility for IA include mutations in Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN among other well recognized risk factors such as high-risk allogeneic HSCT, CMV and respiratory virus infection, and positive Aspergillus PCR. It was recently noted that presence of three of the aforementioned factors generated a 57% probability for developing IA. In patients with no risk factors, the probability of IA was 2%, compared to ~80% in patients with four or more such risk factors ae CMV reactivation after stem cell allograft transplantation increases the risk for IFD during the late transplant period. Unlike the risk factors for early IFD such as AML (HR 3), HLA antigen-mismatched donor graft (HR 3.4); HSCT recipients with lymphoma (HR 8.5), CMV reactivation (HR 5.5), and severe neutropenia (HR 3.5) are considered prominent risk factors for late-onset IFD. Patients with pretransplant IgG responses against Aspergillus proteins indicating significant fungal colonization or ongoing subclinical Aspergillus infections before preparatory conditioning regimen has commenced needs further clinical validation. Evaluation of 5589 HSCT recipients at a comprehensive cancer center between 1985 and 1999 showed increased incidence of IA after 1992 and remained high during that decade. The authors also reported increasing frequency of non-Aspergillus molds such as Fusarium spp. and mucormycosis in the late 1990s. These non-Aspergillus molds were prominent in patients undergoing multiple transplants. Most cases of mucormycosis were seen during the late transplant period, especially in patients with chronic GVHD. In patients undergoing nonmyeloablative HSCT, presence of severe acute GVHD, chronic extensive GVHD, and CMV infection are prominent risk factors for IFD af Invasive aspergillosis is a complication seen in patients with delayed (>2 weeks) recovery of peripheral blood granulocyte count. Patients receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroids are also at an increased risk. Aspergillus fumigatus remains the most prevalent mold to cause invasive human disease, including in patients undergoing HSCT. Infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. are occasionally seen in hematopoietic stem cell allograft recipients and commonly present during the period(s) of severe and prolonged neutropenia ag Routine blood cultures have low sensitivity for diagnosis of fungemia. Carbohydrate biomarker (1, 3)-\u03b2-d-glucan has emerged as a useful laboratory test for the diagnosis of invasive yeast and mold disease. Furthermore, it may be used to monitor response to systemic antifungal therapy and infection relapse ah Post-HSCT recovery of antigen-specific T lymphocyte-mediated immune response against CMV and Candida albicans is regarded as critical during the early and the late transplant period. Most patients develop antigen-specific T-cell response early in the transplant period which is derived from clones of both donor and recipient stem cell origin. Reconstitution of immune response via antigen-specific T lymphocytes of recipient origin is weakened in patients with GVHD. Incidence of IC during the 1st year after nonmyeloablative (5%) and myeloablative transplant conditioning is lower than that for IA (14%). Echinocandin nonsusceptible Candida spp. infection has been recently recognized as an emerging challenge in providing care for these highly vulnerable patients ai PCP is a serious OI in transplant patients with severe cellular immune defect(s). Routine anti-PCP prophylaxis breakthrough infections are rare; although in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine, atypical upper lung PCP may occasionally occur aj Invasive zygomycosis or mucormycosis may occur disproportionally more frequently in patients on voriconazole prophylaxis and those with sinuorbital invasive mold disease. In transplant patients, the overall prevalence is less than 8% among all invasive fungal infections ak Nearly half of the patients with disseminated fusariosis have evidence of fungemia, and close to 80% may exhibit multiple (>10-15) papular skin lesions with a necrotic center that is indistinguishable from ecthyma gangrenosum due to Staphylococcus aureus or disseminated Pseudomonas spp. infection al Dematiaceous or melanin pigmented molds are associated with chronic localized infections and prevalent in certain geographic regions. In transplant patients, disseminated infections may occur; neurotropism is an important feature of these infections, and treatment with older antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B and early generation triazole-based compounds was associated with high rates of treatment failure am The cumulative incidence of CNS infection following HSCT is <1% within first 30 days, 2% within 3 months, and 5% after 5 years following transplantation. Significantly high risk of CNS infection 5 years after CBT (8%) vs. matched related HSCT (2%) is important to note for the purpose of risk stratification. CNS fungal (35%) and viral (32%) infections are prominent, whereas toxoplasmosis and bacterial infection are seen in just over 10% of the patients. Aspergillosis is common (67%) followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (17%). CNS infection in transplant population is associated with high mortality (59%), and low (20%) 5-year overall survival In patients with extensive T-cell immune defects, Strongyloides stercoralis may cause accelerated autoinfection. Hyperinfection pulmonary syndrome in such patients is almost always fatal. Screening serology tests for the presence of strongyloidiasis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after allogeneic HSCT may be falsely negative; and stool ova and parasite examination, in the absence of accelerated autoinfection during the pretransplant, is also riddled with low sensitivity aq American trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi needs to be assessed in patients planned to undergo allograft transplant procedure from endemic regions ar Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of certain species of sand flies and presents as cutaneous (common) and visceral (uncommon and severe) disease; pretransplant evaluation should include serologic testing for prior exposure to these parasites in appropriate patients with high risk for prior exposure Other than suppurative necrosis of the lung, ischemic necrosis, i.e. pulmonary infarction, should also be considered. Tissue invasive mold lung disease may also have comparable radiographic presentation Fig. 1.2 CT scan of lungs without intravenous contrast showing treein-bud appearance due to pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease mostly involving the right lung demonstrating multiple areas of centrilobular nodules with a linear branching pattern. Endobronchial tuberculosis may present with such a radiographic finding, wherein patients with acutely developed tree-in-bud infiltrates bacterial or viral (CMV) etiology may also be entertained. It is important to note that bronchiectasis is the prominent radiographic presentation of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in patients undergoing transplantation. Rarely carcinomatous endarteritis due to breast or gastric cancer; bronchovascular interstitial infiltration due to lymphoma, leukemia, and sarcoidosis may have similar presentation. Scedosporium lung disease and pulmonary fusariosis may occassionally have nodular peribrochovascular distribution at an additional risk for infections that are often seen in asplenic patients or those with functional hyposplenism. Patients with chronic GVHD are not only at an increased risk for systemic fungal disease like invasive aspergillosis or herpes virus reactivation herald by CMV viremia; additionally, encapsulated bacteria such as outlined in Table 1 .1 may also be included in the risk profile during evaluation of such patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 243, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 18276, "end": 18284, "text": "Fig. 1.2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 19536, "end": 19543, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Amar Safdar"}, {"text": "Patients receiving treatment for acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have heightened risk for invasive aspergillosis and infections due to other filamentous molds.

Table 1 .3 illustrates the salient features of infection risk and their association with the type of stem cell graft, pretransplant conditioning preparatory regimens, and drugs commonly used in the prevention of GVHD. Cord blood stem cells are regarded as a major breakthrough for source that yields a steady supply of hematopoietic stem cells, especially among patients with difficult to find, immunologically (HLA-matched) compatible hematopoietic stem cell graft [18] . Cord blood stem cells have a limited number of nucleated cells that are adequate for children. In adults Fig. 1.4 CT scan of lungs without intravenous contrast showing bilateral nodular zygomycosis in a patient following allogeneic HSCT while receiving voriconazole prophylaxis. The right lung nodule with a central cavity cannot be radiographically excluded from other causes of nodular pneumonia such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Fusarium spp., and other mold lung disease. Among bacteria, Nocardia spp. is a concern in allograft transplant recipients with such radiographic presentation. Primary lung lymphoma may have similar presentation. Rarely, patients with relapse acute leukemia in the post HSCT period may present with atypical pulmonary infiltrates with dense consolidation involving both lower lobes in a patient with GVHD, who developed infection due to dematiaceous mold following allogeneic HSCT. In the differential diagnosis, necrotizing bacterial, clear (hyaline) and black (melanin pigmented) mold infections should also be considered along with multifocal pulmonary nocardiosis due to larger body surface area, transplantation with less than optimum number of stem cells complicate posttransplant period with issues such as inadequate and delayed neutrophil engraftment and peripheral blood cell count recovery, precarious graft stability, and, similar to recipients of T-cell-depleted grafts, a higher risk for infections associated with severe and prolonged neutropenia or those observed during GVHD (Tables 1.1 and 1.2) . Various strategies are being explored to assuage this limitation including transplantation with cord blood grafts from more than one donor and ex vivo expansion of a single donor cord blood graft to increase the yield of nucleated cells [21] . In a review of 100 cord blood transplants at a comprehensive cancer center in Houston, Texas, the infection incidence rate ratio, which was total infection episodes per days at risk (survival after CBT) \u00d7 100, was 2.4 times higher in adult patients compared with children [22] .

However, it may take a year or longer to achieve normal functional DC cell population after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Plasmacytoid DCs are important for regulation and maintenance of immune tolerance and defense against viruses. The myeloid DCs serve as APCs that are pivotal in eliciting pathogen-directed cellular adaptive immune response Recovery of NK cells in most patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT occurs usually 45 days after transplantation. These innate immune effector cells can directly lyse virus-infected cells and provide antineoplastic immune surveillance. NK cells are an important, readily available, albeit transient source of IFN\u03b3 and GM-CSF. The chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-8, and RANTES play a critical role in adaptive immune modulation.

following allogeneic HSCT; RSV is notable RTVI in this regard. The 80 days of median duration of viral shedding may extend to just under a year in some allogeneic transplant recipients. This potential for pronged viral shedding warrants heightened awareness and strict adherence to appropriate precautions to prevent nosocomial RSV transmission to other vulnerable hospitalized patients. In the pediatric HSCT recipients, RSV infection within 60 days after transplant, patients given systemic corticosteroids within a week prior to the onset of RSV infection and the need for assisted mechanical ventilation were significant predictors for subsequent complications and death w The BK virus was first isolated in 1971; after primary childhood infection, persistent BKV infection occurs within renal tubular cells and the urothelium. Viral reactivation in the recipients of kidney and allogeneic HSCT usually presents as allograft nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis, respectively. Presently, reduction in drug-induced immune suppression, when possible, and supportive care are the only viable treatment option; direct antiviral drug against BKV remains elusive x EBV influence over B-cell malignant clones may act through different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and possibly variance in genetic mechanisms that eventually determined viral latency during early EBV infection and EBV-host interaction y The incidence of hMPV infection was similar to the incidence of RSV or parainfluenza virus UTRIs in patients undergoing HSCT. hMPV infections are notable for low risk of progression to the LRT.

interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection; treatment with isoniazid is considered gold standard and should be administered for a minimum of 6 months prior to the transplantation procedure, with the aim to prevent active tuberculosis infection during the post-transplant period. Such infections tend to be more serious and, due to potential drug toxicity and drug-drug interaction, often difficult to treat after allograft transplantation l M. kansasii leads to clinical disease indistinguishable from M. tuberculosis infection; risk for infection relapse, drug resistance, and infection recalcitrance are reason for longer duration of therapy m In a recent study from South Korea, in 7342 SOT and 1266 HSCT recipients, 22 patients developed NTM after a median 2 years following transplantation. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex was the most common pathogen isolated; nodular bronchiectasis (~80%) was common presentation. A near 70% response to antimicrobial therapy in this group was encouraging. However, disseminated NTM including MAC disease in severely immunosuppressed patients following high-risk allogeneic HSCT may occasionally present as salvage therapy-refractroy recalcitrant bacteremia with high fatality Risk of CMV infection is highest in CMV-seronegative recipients in whom allograft is given from a CMV-seropositive donor. Ganciclovir prophylaxis effectively prevents CMV disease in high-risk patients during the first 100 days after allogeneic HSCT Late CMV disease is associated with high mortality rate nearing 45% and seen 170 median days after HSCT. It is important to recognize that close to 40% of patients that respond to the initial episode of late posttransplant CMV infection will develop a second CMV episode within a median of 11-12 weeks. Three months after HSCT, patients with positive CMV-pp65 antigenemia; post-engraftment severe lymphopenia of less than 100 lymphocytes/mm 3 , especially those with helper T-cell lymphocytopenia of less than 50 cells/mm 3 ; presence of GVHD; and those with undetectable CMV-specific T-cell responses are at higher risk for late CMV end-organ disease. Furthermore, after 100 days following transplantation, presence of CMV viremia or pp65 antigenemia and severe lymphopenia endorsed by less than 300 lymphocytes/mm 3 is considered strong predictors for late CMV disease and death p Most frequently detected viruses in symptomatic HSCT or SOT recipients with URTI are picornaviruses (~40%), such as rhinovirus and enterovirus, whereas coronavirus and influenza are isolated in nearly 20% of such patients, each. Influenza URTIs similar to RSV and unlike parainfluenza virus infections have the potential for progression to the lower respiratory tract. Viral pneumonitis is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is important to recognize that hosts' immune response to influenza infection garners a high IFNgamma state resulting in a transient increased susceptibility for secondary bacterial infections like pneumococcus, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas spp. The resulting superimposed bacterial pneumonia may precipitate life-threatening sepsis and respiratory failure. Furthermore, RTVIs are recognized as fostering enhanced susceptibility for invasive fungal lung disease during early and late transplant periods q Serologic evaluation of the donor and recipient for latent CMV infection is the cornerstone during pretransplant assessment. Dissonance between D+ and R-CMV serology is the most important complicating factors during early and late posttransplant period.
