Inability to hold the mouthpiece because of missing teeth poses a contraindication to scuba diving. Dental concerns in divers include temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and muscle pain from holding the regulator (\u2018diver\u2019s mouth syndrome\u2019), barotrauma and barodontalgia (from the effects of pressure changes), and the management of prostheses. Many divers experience TMJ and/or facial muscle pain or headache from the continuous jaw clenching. Mouthpieces are usually made of neoprene or silicone rubber and are held in place by bite tabs that fit into the dentition at the canine and premolar area. The average dive lasts 30\u201360 minutes and requires constant jaw muscle effort.
