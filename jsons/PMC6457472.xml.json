In many agent-based epidemic models, the concepts of networks are used to represent contacts among individuals (Bian 2004; Bian & Liebner 2007). Each individual can have attributes, such as infection status and spatial locations, whereas each link can also have a set of attributes, such as the duration of the contact and the infection rate. Based on human interaction networks, epidemiologists can use agent-based epidemic models to simulate disease transmission and design different control scenarios.",

These models predict that interactions at homes and workplaces could cause local transmission followed by a long distance transmission to an area-wide epidemic (Eubank et al. 2004).

Spatial locations, one attribute of each agent, are treated as spatial stamps of the transmission process in the individual-centric agent-based modeling (Zhong & Bian 2016). Such representations suffer from a number of drawbacks regarding transmission and control design. First, the importance of locations in understanding disease transmission and control has been missing. For example, antiviral \u201cring chemoprophylaxis\u201d strategies aim to geographically targeted containment via applying a certain distance threshold (e.g., 5 km) by means of prophylaxis to attempt to prevent spread to unaffected regions (Lee et al. 2010). In fact, infectious disease transmission is the mixing patterns of geographical mobility and social interactions that are much more complicated than a simple distance threshold. Second, the design of control strategies based on individual-based networks (e.g., vaccinate the individual with a large number of contacts) is challenging because it is infeasible to keep track of all social contacts of infections (Cohen, Havlin, & Ben-Avraham 2003; G\u00f3mez-Gardenes, Echenique, & Moreno 2006; Holme 2004), but the information to estimate population flows among locations based on intra- and inter-community travelers is widely available in the existing census data and travel survey reports (Mao & Bian 2010). Thus, location-based human interaction network models are required to easily represent explicitly spatial dynamics of the disease transmission and design control strategies to target certain critical locations first rather than prioritizing individuals.",

Following the natural history of the influenza, each individual can take one of four statuses: susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered (SEIR) at a given time (Anderson & May 1992). All individuals in our model are initially considered as susceptible to influenza. After contact with an infection, susceptible individuals have a probability of infection. Those newly infected change their statuses from susceptible to exposed. Exposed individuals may progressively develop their infectious statuses, which further enable them to transmit the influenza viruses to susceptible contacts.

The basic idea of vaccination strategies is first to rank the importance of individuals according to their network measures (e.g., degree, betweenness) and then target the individuals from the highest network measures to lowest. The random-based strategy treats all of individuals the same and randomly identifies a certain number of individuals for vaccination. The degree-based strategy prioritizes individuals who have the most contacts within the network for vaccination. The betweenness-based strategy ranks the importance of individuals according to their betweenness centrality that can capture the extent to which a particular node lies on those shortest paths that pass through the nodes (Freeman 1978).",

Degree-based vaccination strategy tends to show the most effectiveness with different network structures (Pastor-Satorras & Vespignani 2002; Zanette & Kuperman 2002), especially when community structure is not strong such as a scale-free network (Albert, Jeong, & Barab\u00e1si 2000).

The simulation will stop when there are no new infections for six consecutive days (length of exposed period + length of infectious period).

Based on the strategy rationale, we considered the locations where the first infection visited as the original case cluster. The original case cluster and all of the rest locations which have the population flows to the original case clusters were used to determine the first level local containment scale. The second level geo-social local containment scale was determined by all of the locations in the first level local containment area and the locations which have the population flows to the locations in the first level local containment area, so were the third, the forth, and the fifth level local geo-social containment scales. Though the location network was dynamic over time in a day, the strategy design was based on the total population flows among different locations within one day for a practice purpose. It is more practical to design vaccination strategy at a daily basis instead of at an hourly basis. In order to understand the impact of the spatially heterogeneous population distribution and mobility on the design of vaccination strategies, we randomly pick the first infection 10 times with varying total number of individuals in the first level local containment area (i.e., 1000, 5000, and 10000). The larger number of individuals within the first level local containment scale is caused by the high local population density which potentially leads to more complicated population interaction and mobility to larger geographical regions.",

Parallel algorithms are developed to deal with the most computation intensive tasks: 1) the calculation of the betweenness centrality and 2) the simulation of influenza epidemics. For the former, it is widely understood that the definitions of betweenness centrality in very large networks have inherently high computational complexity. The parallel algorithm is adapted from the Brande\u2019s algorithm (Brandes 2001), and the actual running time is about 30 hours using 40 computing nodes, each with 8 cores and 16 GB of RAM memory. For the latter, the parallel algorithm is developed following the SEIR rules as discussed earlier, and the running time ranges from 10 to 60 hours for a given first infection and vaccination strategy using the same computing nodes. The parallel design does not only reduce the running time but also improve the scalability of this methodology framework, which are essential for analyzing extremely large network data.",

Fig. 2 illustrates that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of infections. The random-based vaccination strategy generates the largest number of infections, followed by the degree-based and betweenness-based vaccination strategies. The latter two vaccination strategies produce the similar control efficacy in which betweenness-based ones lead to a relatively faster decreasing number of infections. The explanation of such patterns is illustrated in the Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows that an increasing number of vaccines can produce a decreasing number of local containment failure rates. In other words, betweenness-based vaccination strategies can contain disease outbreak at the local geo-social scales more successfully than the other two vaccination strategies. One reason is that betweenness-based vaccination strategies target high risk individuals who lie on the bridge among different communities, so they can control epidemics more effective through preventing epidemic outbreak from the local geo-social containment areas to outside areas.",

They both display consistent patterns: the initial infections occurring in the higher population density areas can lead to higher number of infections (Fig. 4) because they increase the local containment failure rates with the same number of vaccines (Fig. 5). For example, the disease transmission caused by the first infection from locations with a medium population density can areas be confined locally at a very high percentage (i.e., 80 %) with less than 100,000 infections using 350,000 vaccines (Fig. 4b and 5b), whereas the same amount of vaccines can only successfully contain the disease outbreak from high population density locations less than 20 percent with more than 300,000 infections. Such patterns imply that we need more vaccine available in order to contain disease outbreak from critical locations with high human interaction density and large numbers of population flows from infected locations to others. Thus, it is essential to place sensors in the hubs of the locations to allow highly efficient outbreak detection.",

For example, the random-based control scenario with more than 150,000 vaccines can successfully contain the disease outbreak in a high population density area (Fig. 4 a), but it generates less than 600,000 infections (Fig. 4 b) and more than 600,000 infections (Fig. 4 c and d). From the both (c) and (d) of the Fig. 4, Fig. 5, we can tell that there is no obvious difference in terms of containment efficacy when the local containment areas are larger than certain scales in both (c) and (d). One explanation is that a certain number of vaccines have its threshold of susceptible population pool. The number of local control failure increases after the susceptible population pool goes beyond the threshold with the increasing local geo-social containment areas. When the disease outbreak occurs outside of the containment areas in the most simulation runs, the number of total infections finally reach similar amounts. We also notice that it is unlikely to confine the disease outbreaks caused by the first infection from high population density areas, if the local geo-social containment areas are set too large (Fig. 5c and 5d). When the first infection is from low population density areas, the likelihood to contain disease outbreaks within a large local geo-social containment areas is still very high (Fig. 5c and 5d). Thus, we can reach the conclusion that an appropriate geo-social scale for the local containment and the population density where the first infection resides are two keys for prevention strategies to achieve their maximum control effectiveness.",

To achieve this goal, we built a large-scale two-layer location-based social network model including an innovative location-based network to design vaccination strategies and an individual-based spatially explicit disease model to evaluate the efficacy of the above vaccination strategies. We implemented the network model in parallel algorithms to take advantage of a high performance platform of CPU to tackle the challenge of extremely intensive computation with millions of nodes and edges. The simulation results suggested that geo-social interaction patterns can be used to design effective vaccination strategies to contain epidemic outbreaks at the source. Increasing extents of local geo-social containment areas lead to decreasing control effectiveness because it becomes challenging to confine the spread of influenza within local containment areas. Especially when the local containment scale is larger than the upper limit, there is little difference in terms of spatial effectiveness. Vaccination designs should consider spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement in an urban area. It is possible to confine disease outbreaks for early infections in the low population areas, even if local geo-social containment areas have been set too large. It is unlikely to confine disease outbreaks for early infections in the high population areas if local geo-social containment areas are set too large. This study highlighted the importance of identifying the population density for the early infections and an appropriate geo-social scale for local containment in order to achieve maximum control effectiveness with a limited number of vaccines.",

The identified geo-social interaction patterns and their effectiveness in designing vaccination strategies provide valuable insights for helping meet the above challenges. They can help identify critical individuals, locations, and clusters of locations for disease control purposes. Traditional prevention strategies, including ring vaccination and contact tracing, can only capture one aspect of infectious disease transmission (i.e., spatial, or social) and both of which have significant limitations. \u201cContact tracing\u201d strategies require the identification of people who may have had contact with infectious individuals (Germann et al. 2006), which is difficult to implement in real situations considering the limited resources and time before the disease outbreak. \u201cRing vaccination\u201d with a simple distance threshold (e.g., 5km) (Lee et al. 2010) is easy to implement, but it may fail to capture the most likely and complicated disease transmission processes. Many research have demonstrated that ring vaccination alone might not lead to containment of disease outbreak with a high R\n0 at the source (Kucharski et al. 2016; Wells et al. 2015), but a combined intervention of contact tracing and ring vaccination might contribute increase the ability to contain outbreaks of emerging infectious disease threats (Kretzschmar, Van den Hof, Wallinga, & Van Wijngaarden 2004; Longini Jr et al. 2005; Merler et al. 2016; Diao and Wang, 2014; Diao and Wang, 2016). The proposed geo-social interaction patterns cannot only address the inherent challenges of contact tracing to identify contacts with infections, but also capture the mixed interactions of the social and spatial relationships among individuals that determine infectious disease transmission (Luo & MacEachren 2014).",

It shows great promise to build location-based social networks with large-scale social media data to provide real-time estimation and prevention strategy design in a timely manner. Second, the location-based social network framework is built on population interaction and movement patterns in a normal situation, but people may adjust their behaviors accordingly during an epidemic outbreak. Thus, human preventive behaviors caused by inter-personal influence (Mao & Yang 2012) and mass media could be incorporated to refine the framework. Third, this research focuses on the impact of vaccination strategies on geo-social interactions patterns, but has not evaluated such impact of other prevention strategies such as travel restrictions and case isolation. Forth, this research also has implications for the control of other location-based spreading pheonmena, such as invasive species (Diao & Wang 2016, Diao & Wang 2018), and HIV transmission (Luo et.al 2018).",
