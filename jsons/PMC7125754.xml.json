This compound showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro with IC50 of 42.79 \u00b1 4.97 \u03bcM in a competitive mode. Molecular modeling strongly suggested that the residue Q189 plays a key role in the binding between quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside and SARS-CoV 3CLpro. To confirm this binding model, site-directed mutagenesis of the 3CLpro protease was performed. Comparative studies between SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A using CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectra, and enzyme activity assays were conducted to determine the mechanistic effects of the Q189A mutation on enzyme\u2013inhibitor interaction. The results indicated that while SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A retained the same level of biological activity as its wild-type counterpart, the inhibitory potency of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside on SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A was decreased due to a reduction in binding affinity. To further explore the mode of binding interaction between the natural product and SARS-CoV 3CLpro, and discover more potent inhibitors, we systematically designed, with the aid of structural information from molecular modeling, and synthesized eight quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside derivatives (2a\u2013h). We then tested their inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The results showed that removing the hydroxy groups on the quercetin moiety (2f\u2013h) substantially decreased inhibitory activity; acetoxylation of the sugar moiety (2a) was unfavorable for the inhibitory activity of the compound; and introduction of a large sugar substituent on 7-hydroxy of quercetin (2e) did not adversely affect the ability of the inhibitor to functionally disrupt the SARS-CoV 3CLpro protease activity. All the experimental results were in good agreement with the molecular binding model. Thus, this work not only demonstrates quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside and its derivatives as a new class of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, but also clarifies the mode of binding interaction between the flavonoids and SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The elucidation of a legible pharmacophore of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors lays the foundation for future rational drug design.",

            "text": "A bioflavanoid, quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside (1), was discovered by virtual screening as a potent binder to the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The predicted binding free energy, inhibitory constant, and the predicted Log \nP are \u22129.24 kcal/mol, 1.70 \u00d7 10\u22127, and 0.43, respectively. Figure 1\nshows the details of the specific interactions between quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside and the enzyme active site. Clearly, the molecule forms hydrophobic interactions with residues Leu141, Asn142, Met165, and Glu166 of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the inhibitor forms six hydrogen bonds with residues in the vicinity of the catalytic binding pocket (Fig. 1). The N atom of main chain of Glu166 forms two hydrogen bonds with quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside with distances of 2.88 and 3.28 \u00c5, respectively, while the O\u03b51 and N\u03b52 atoms of the Gln189 side chain form four hydrogen bonds with distances of 2.62, 2.69, 3.44, and 3.68 \u00c5, respectively. This binding model points to Gln189 as a crucial residue providing the key interaction elements for the binding of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Logically then, substitution of the polar Gln189 residue to an aliphatic alanine residue would reduce the number of hydrogen bond interaction sites and thus significantly weaken the binding affinity. From the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro,12 it is shown that Gln189 lies in the long loop region (residues 185\u2013200), separated from the active sites of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the Q189A mutation was not expected to adversely affect the catalytic capability of the enzyme but rather lead to a significant drop in its binding affinity to quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside. Thus, this mutational model provides a good index for assessing the correctness of our proposed docking released binding mechanism. In addition, it can be observed from Figure 1B that there is ample spatial capacity within the binding pocket of the enzyme around the 7-hydroxy group of quercetin, suggesting that this site can accommodate significant structural modification with larger chemical moieties around 7-hydroxy of quercetin (2e).",

Thus, the CD spectra demonstrated that the secondary structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A is similar to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.14 The evidence from CD analysis excludes the possibility of structural misfolding resulting from the mutagenesis of Gln189.

For kinetic analysis on the Biacore3000 instrument, various concentrations of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside were injected for 120 min at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min to allow for interaction with SARS-CoV 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A immobilized on the sensor chip surface. The binding curves of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside with SARS-CoV 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A are shown in Figure 4\n. For the SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig. 4A), quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside results in a significant and dose-dependent increase in SPR response units (RU) and presents characteristic fast-binding and slow-dissociation curves. The concentration series of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside are fitted by the 1:1 Langmuir binding model in the Biacore3000 evaluation software for binding affinity determination. The dissociation constant (K\nD) between quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside and SARS-CoV 3CLpro was determined as 38.41 \u00b1 2.06 \u03bcM. This result is consistent with our molecular modeling prediction that Q189A mutation would lead to a significant drop in binding affinity.

Biological evaluation of inhibitory activities of these analogues (Table 1) provides the basis to formulate the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) The key elements observed are: (1) removing the hydroxy groups of the quercetin moiety (2f\u2013h) substantially decreases the inhibitory activity of the derivatives, (2) acetoxylation of sugar moiety (2a) abolishes inhibitory functions, (3) introduction of a large sugar substituent on 7-hydroxy of quercetin (2e) can be tolerated, and (4) replacement of the galactose moiety with other sugars, such as fucose (2b), arabinose (2c), and glucose (2d), had no evident effect on inhibitor potency. These observations were in good agreement with the molecular binding model.",

Both molecular modeling and G189A mutation revealed that Gln189 plays a key role in the binding of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Furthermore, comparative studies of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV 3CLpro Q189A employing CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectra, and enzyme activity assay revealed no evidence that secondary structure and biological activity of the protease are affected by the mutation. Eight new derivatives of the quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside containing systematic chemical variations to binding elements were rationally designed under the guidance of molecular modeling and successfully synthesized. The bioassay data obtained from these new compounds demonstrate that the four hydroxy groups of the quercetin moiety are key determinants of the bioactivity of this type of inhibitors, that the spatial dimensions of the binding pocket in the vicinity of the sugar moiety and 7-hydroxy site of quercetin can accommodate large structural modifications, and that the hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety should be unprotected to allow compound\u2013target interaction by hydrogen bonding. Our data provide new insights into the essential interactions of quercetin-3-\u03b2-galactoside with the binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, thus leading to a legible pharmacophore of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that will aid future inhibitor design.",

After the initial orientation and scoring evaluation, grid-based rigid body minimization was carried out for the ligand to locate the nearest local energy minimum within the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding site. The top-3000 molecules obtained from the DOCK search were selected for further analyses.
