Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Methods All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. Results Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications.

Studies had demonstrated that several candidate genes (GPX7, GSTT1, and SNX19) directly influence critical biological processes and functions including proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Approximately, 90% of the causal variants in T1DM are noncoding with esti-mated~60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers and many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer associated RNA after immune stimulation [42] . In a study to explore the cellular and molecular changes in islets of pancreas and \u03b2 cells in response to immunological stressors (proinflammatory cytokines), it was reported that epigenetic modification (methylation of insulin DNA) may be a mechanism by which insulin gene expression is affected during the progression of T1DM in nonobese diabetic mice [43] .

Environmental factors in corroboration with genetic factors triggers also trigger autoimmunity leading to subsequent progression into T1DM, as supported by the fact that individuals living with the highest-risk HLA haplotypes are not observed to develop T1DM [29] . However, the extreme exposures to environmental conditions triggers in the first few years of life may also be critical as suggested by evidences from the early age of the onset of islet autoantibodies actions in childhood-onset of T1DM. However, the variability of age at the disease onset may complicate the study of its effects on environmental exposures. Viral infection is another mechanism implicated in the occurrence of diabetes, however, there is no direct evidence reported as a particular strain of virus being link to cause T1DM [46] . Interestingly, it has been documented that exposure during fetal life to rubella has been shown to increase the incidence of T1DM and other autoimmune disorders [37] . Data from epidemiological studies have strongly suggested the involvement of coxsackievirus B (an enterovirus) in T1DM development as evident from the presence of RNA or proteins from such enteroviruses in pancreas and some other neighboring tissues from T1DM patients. Enteroviruses infect the \u03b2 cells and activate innate immunity and inflammation in the early phase of T1DM. Although as an antiviral protein, virus-induced interferon alpha acts as initiators towards autoimmunity directed against pancreatic \u03b2 cells and this can be deleterious. Moreover, enteroviruses can interact effectively with adaptive immune system by successive or through persistent infections [47] . Host genes, such as IFIH1 which encode melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), influence susceptibility of individuals to T1DM. Reports have shown that an upward activity of the IFIH1 protein activities may promote T1DM development. Once viral infection occurs, MDA5 proteins provoke the proliferation of mediators of the innate antiviral immune response, thus acting as a cytoplasmic sensor to viruses, more especially coxsackieviruses B [48, 49] . In a study to explore the relationship between autoimmunity, insulitis, viral infection, \u03b2 cell function and survival in T1DM, islets from six recent-onset T1DM patients were studied. Enterovirus was found to be able to infect \u03b2 cells in T1DM patients, which is associated with inflammation and functional impairment [50] . Viruses may also induce an autoimmune response by using mechanisms like molecular mimicry, a phenomenon involving the sharing of antigenic properties between \u03b2 cells and environmental agents. Thus immune responses are directed against autoantigens which resemble the actual viruses' antigens and results in their cellular destruction [37] . P2-C protein of Coxsackie B4 virus, for example, is significantly similar in their amino acid sequence to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) enzyme which is found in \u03b2 cells of endocrine pancreas [37] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1255, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1933, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2389, "end": 2393, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2397, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2717, "end": 2721, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3058, "end": 3062, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3262, "end": 3266, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Environmental factors"}, {"text": "Among the environmental associations, the importance of diet is still a matter of debate. For example, a study documented that at early age administration of dairy products consumption and that of high milk during early childhood increase the levels of antibodies in cow's milk and that high IgA antibodies in cow's milk formula increase the risk of T1DM independently [50] . It was documented that a peculiar part of the albumin from cow's milk, called the ABBOS, which contain 17 peptides, can function as a self-reactive epitope because of its resemblance to another p69 protein found in at surface of pancreatic \u03b2 cells [51] . Moreover, the ingestion of plants based nutrient elements provided the notion of a link between T1DM and earlier exposures of cereals into the diet [52] and gluten [53] . Inadequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids has also been studied in association with T1DM [54] . Nitrate administration from water intake [55] and toxic doses of nitrosamine compounds may also result in diabetes via generation of some free radicals but it is unclear if dietary nitrate, nitrite, or nitrosamine exposure on human T1D could act in the same manner [56] . Many perinatal risk factors which are seen in childhood diabetes are also linked with T1DM [57] like maternalchild blood group incompatibility, pre-eclampsia, neonatal infections and respiratory distress, maternal age, gestational age, birth weight and order [58] [59] [60] [61] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 779, "end": 783, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 795, "end": 799, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 890, "end": 894, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 938, "end": 942, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1166, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1432, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1437, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1442, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1447, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Environmental factors"}, {"text": "Recent data indicate that altered gut microbiomes have also implications in the pathogenesis of T1DM as evident by the differences in the gut microbiome profile of T1DM versus healthy controls [33] .

However, in children who are destined for autoimmunity usually develop a microbiome with less diversity and stability. Therefore, autoimmune microbiome identified with T1D may be specifically different from that existing in healthy children [62] . It has been known that dietary exposure is the regulator of the immunity and self-tolerance by changing gut microbiome [63] .

Disorders associated with routine immune mechanisms may result in autoimmunity that could lead to T1DM. Organ-specific autoimmune disease could cause an autoimmune response against host pancreatic \u03b2 cells. T1DM is similarly complicated often times with other autoimmune diseases and presence of anti-islet autoantibodies precede the clinical onset of disease. The occurrence of anti-islet autoantibodies (islet cell antibodies, ICA) in patients diagnosed with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome was first analyzed in 1974 [65] . Later, researchers reported target autoantigens against ICA, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and more recently against zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) [66] [67] [68] . Individuals exhibiting positivity for single autoantibody most often revert to negative, however, reversion is not common in people with multiple autoantibodies [69] . The risk of development of T1DM in children with HLA risk genotypes or with their relatives who have been diagnosed with T1DM, is said to occur in two or more islet autoantibodies at 75% within 10 years [70] , where the risk increases with the increasing numbers of autoantibodies [70, 71] . The concurrent expression of two or up to three autoantibodies acts as the markers of progression into clinical T1DM [72] . Recently, a study into TEDDY (the environmental determinants of diabetes in the young) funded by the National Institutes of Health, look into individuals who had already established two or more autoantibodies. Krischer et al. suggested that the risk of progression from multiple autoantibodies disorders to T1DM was not seen different among those with or even without a family history of the disease. They also indicated that this was higher in female gender, when a few high-risk HLA-DR and HLA-DQ subtypes are present while their study indicated an inverse relationship to the age of first appearance of positive autoantibodies in the family [73] . The presence of islet autoantibodies illicit immune response on B-and T-cell to the antigens present on \u03b2-cell leading to their loss and function. This eventually leads to initiation of glucose intolerance, a stage prior to onset of diabetes clinical symptoms. \u03b2 cell destruction in T1DM occurs most probably via programmed cell death (apoptosis). Autoreactive T lymphocytes induce inflammatory reactions with the expression of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, INF-\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) within the islet that activates the caspase cascade. Moreover, other researchers suggested that apoptosis is induced directly from the contact of autoreactive T lymphocytes with \u03b2 cells through the Fas/Fas ligand interaction or perforating system [74, 75] . Chronic inflammation within the islets occurs involving T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells prior to the onset of T1DM that evolves over many months or years with asymptomatic and euglycemic patients. Clinical manifestation of the disease or symptomatic high glucose level (hyperglycemia) occurs after an extended latency period, which is reflected by the destruction of a large number of functioning \u03b2 cells [76] . It has been reported that mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene resulting from recessive Mendelian disorder autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1) and APS-1 patients develop multiorgan autoimmune diseases are included in T1DM.
