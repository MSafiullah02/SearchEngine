            "text": "The rapid spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the related pneumonia COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 increases with age. While it is 0% for children younger than 10 years, it increases up to 1% in the sixth decade of life and exceeds 20% in the ninth decade (Onder et al., 2020). However, it was obvious already at a very early stage of the pandemic that healthcare workers are affected in 29% of the cases, which is disproportionately high (Wang et al., 2020). Inevitably, healthcare workers are in close contact with infected patients. Transmission of the virus seems to occur mainly by respiratory droplets (Lu et al., 2020, van Doremalen et al., 2020). There is a high viral load in the nasal cavity of infected patients, which especially puts those specialties at risk for a SARS-CoV-2 infection that are located around this region (van Doremalen et al., 2020). Besides ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons and dentists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons especially have to be aware of the new challenges that the risk of virus transmission between patients and medical staff, and vice versa, imply (Peng et al., 2020). During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the specialty must organize patient treatment in such a way that infection transmission is reduced to a minimum, while all relevant treatment options are at hand to provide adequate patient care. Also, there must be preparation for situations in which a shortage of disposability of medical staff might occur or anesthesiologic capacity might be reduced for oral and maxillofacial surgery patients due to a focus on critically ill COVID-19 patients. Concepts have to be developed that take into account the possible need for triaging patients according to the degree of urgency of treatment in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Currently, specific guidelines and recommendations are just evolving. It is not surprising that at this stage, with limited clinical evidence, even conflicting points of view concerning the most adequate handling of some scenarios have to be discussed. Therefore, the aim of the present narrative-style review is to collect and to discuss aspects of approaching the management of inpatients and outpatients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For certain time intervals, healthcare might have to focus on critically ill COVID-19 patients. Scarcity of resources can require postponement of elective surgery in order to reduce the pressure on the healthcare system. It is important to have a clear and well-communicated concept for prioritizing procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery (Table 1\n). Although it might be easy to distinguish between elective and emergency procedures, the boundaries between interventions of intermediate and urgent priority might be blurred sometimes. Therefore, respective guidelines might differ between institutions or might be dependent on individual characteristics of an institution. If a conservative therapy is equivalent to surgery, it should be preferred in times of limited capacity for surgery.",

A relevant overlap can be expected between oral and maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology, on the one hand, and oral and maxillofacial surgery and general dentistry on the other hand. Agreements should be reached early. Situations should be avoided/prevented that require having to make decisions under pressure. Definitely, it makes sense to assign procedures such as removal of teeth and related complications such as bleeding, treatment of localized abscesses in the oral cavity, repair of oro-antral fistulae, treatment of pulpitis, etc., to general dentistry. On the other hand, oral and maxillofacial surgery should focus on malignancies, deep head and neck infections, or open and comminuted fractures. Well-defined fields of action will allow using limited resources effectively.",

When performing a clinical examination wearing a surgical mask, the use of goggles and gloves is recommended. Antiseptic mouth rinse is believed to reduce the viral load in the oral cavity.

In times of limited resources, oral and maxillofacial surgery must focus on treatment of malignancies, traumatology, deep head and neck infection, severe hemorrhage, or severe temporomandibular joint pathologies that can be approached only by surgery. General dentistry must take care of removal of teeth and related complications such as bleeding, treatment of localized abscesses in the oral cavity, treatment of pulpitis, repair of oro-antral fistulae, or craniomandibular disorders that cannot be approached by surgery.

Healthcare workers have to spend a certain percentage of their working time on continuing education and transfer of their own knowledge within their institution and in between institutions. In order not to neglect the aspect of social distancing at the same time, it is important to foster concepts of technology-enhanced learning, which also includes e-learning. This approach has been developed to allow the reduction of face-to-face scenarios to a minimum while the intensity of the learning experience is kept at a high level (Nkenke et al., 2012a, Nkenke et al., 2012b). In the field of e-learning, webinars are rising in relevance significantly. They allow dissemination of new information in an interactive way, even at short notice, to a large audience. Webinars also have been proved to be well accepted in medical education (Knipfer et al., 2019, Wagner et al., 2019). This technology will be most important during the peak of the pandemic to keep everybody up-to-date without taking risks for infection as a consequence of unnecessary institutional meetings and conferences, for example, would pose (Merchant and Lurie, 2020).",

In addition, fecal\u2013oral routes are discussed similarly to the former SARS epidemic (Drosten et al., 2003). Although COVID-19 does not include eye symptoms, it has been shown that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to respiratory and fecal\u2013oral routes, but that eye exposure may provide an additional route for the virus to enter the body (To et al., 2020). The transmission routes seem to include a direct one (cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation) as well as a contact transmission (oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes) (Lu et al., 2020). It also has been stated that SARS-CoV-2 may be airborne through aerosols produced during various procedures (Wax and Christian, 2020). In the context of transmission, it should be mentioned that an otorhinolaryngologist was the first doctor to die from COVID-19. Therefore, it must be stressed that, especially, specialties such as otorhinolaryngology, general dentistry, and oral and maxillofacial surgery have to have adequate infrastructures and personal protection equipment in their inpatient and outpatient settings. The aim is to protect patients as well as doctors from unnecessary infection while seeking or providing healthcare during the pandemic (Chan et al., 2020b). An early report on hospitalized patients revealed that hospital-acquired transmission accounted for 41.3% of these patients (Wang et al., 2020). Definitely, a hospital environment with inadequate viral transmission protection can be a relevant route for the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, each and every measure should be taken to decrease the risk of disease transmission. These measures can even include adapting the composition of mouth rinses. SARS-CoV-2 seems to be sensitive to oxidation. As a consequence, it has been recommended that 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone iodine should be used in addition to the more commonly used mouth rinses (Peng et al., 2020).",

The latter corresponds with the fact that less than half of infected cancer patients are undergoing active treatments for cancer (Yu et al., 2020). Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of visits of cancer patients to inpatient and outpatient units must be reduced, weighing the risk of recurrence against the risk of infection.

The practice of triage helps to reduce unnecessary exposure to and contamination with the virus in inpatient and outpatient environments.
