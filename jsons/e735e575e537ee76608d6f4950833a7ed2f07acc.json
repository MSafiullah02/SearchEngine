Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases.

DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens (Ags) or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules. Having emerged as a result of the parasite-host coevolution, viruses as vehicles for delivery and expression of Ag-encoding sequences may also function as immune adjuvants, enhancing immune responses to the transgeneexpressed Ags. Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for the development of virus-based vaccines and their effective clinical use. Human adenovirus (Ad) emerged as one of the top candidate viral vectors for vaccine development owing primarily to its relatively low pathogenicity, genetic safety, and the lack of host genome integration step in its replication cycle. Other attractive features of Ad for vaccine application include its strong immune-adjuvant properties, highly efficient infection of various cell types, and vast transgene incorporation/cloning capacity. Although this chapter primarily focuses on the use of human Ad for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, application of other viral vectors for vaccine development will also be briefly discussed. We will present vaccines first according to delivery systems/viral vector types and then with regard to their clinical applications, i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic. This will lead to detailed description of Ad as a vaccine vector, its taxonomy (serotype diversity), as well as the genomic and molecular structures. Ad biological properties related to its potential role as a vaccine vector will be highlighted along with advantages and potential hurdles for vaccine development. Along these lines, we will discuss in detail the \"Ag capsid incorporation\" strategy aimed at generating robust humoral Ag-specific immune responses while circumventing vector-specific preexisting immunity. Substantial attention will be devoted to Ad vectors carrying \"arming\" transgenes with immunostimulatory functions as a vaccine adjuvant strategy and illustrate its use for the development of therapeutic vaccines against cancer. Retargeting of Ad vectors to specific cell surface receptors (de-targeting from natural Ad5 receptor \"coxsackie/adenovirus receptor\") will be discussed along with the underlying molecular technologies as a means of augmenting Ad infectivity for cancer cells and improving its gene transfer efficiency. We will also describe vaccination strategies involving combinations of Ad vectors with other (non-Ad) vaccine systems as well as the prime/boost strategy of immunization and commonly used immunocompetent animal models for immunotherapy studies and preclinical evaluation of adenoviral vaccines.

The term \"vaccine\" comes from the Latin word vaccinus, translated as \"pertaining to cows,\" which reflects the history of the discovery. Although by the beginning of the twentieth century vaccination had already been widely used for prevention of other infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, rabies, and plague, that had nothing to do with cows, the original term remained.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 261, "text": "(Jenner 1904)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Traditional concept of vaccination applies to induction of protective immunity against a given pathogen in a host achieved through intentional exposure to the natural or surrogate pathogen or Ags derived from such pathogens. The source of Ags can vary from well-defined recombinant proteins to natural proteins isolated from the pathogen or the whole pathogen. The first-generation vaccines included \"live\" or \"attenuated\" vaccines, prepared from pathogenic viruses, such as yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella, or bacteria, such as Salmonella enterica enterica, with reduced virulence. Treatment of virulent strains with temperature or chemicals allows for the generation of \"inactivated\" or \"killed\" vaccines. Those include influenza, cholera, polio, hepatitis A, and rabies vaccines as well as \"toxoids,\" formaldehyde-inactivated toxins naturally produced by some pathogens and represented by diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. While pathogens/toxins in such vaccines are no longer infectious/toxic, i.e., biologically safe, their immunogenic properties are retained.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Advances in basic knowledge in immunology along with the development of recombinant DNA technology in the past 50 years prompted extensive efforts in vaccine development and led to second-generation vaccines, including recombinant vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology substantially expanded the repertoire of vaccine types, which may differ with regard to the form of immunological target (immunogen) and route of delivery. Recombinant vaccines comprise several distinct classes: (1) \"subunit\" vaccines that are typically obtained by genetic cloning and expression of immunogenic proteins or their individual subunits/domains using various expression systems, such as bacterial, yeast, or mammalian; (2) \"conjugate\" vaccines, a special type of \"subunit\" vaccines using Ags or toxoids conjugated to polysaccharides, enhancing their immunogenicity, such as Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine; (3) DNA or \"naked\" DNA vaccines; and (4) viral-vectored vaccines. In the latter instances, foreign Ags are expressed in the host cells upon the delivery of recombinant DNA molecules coding for such Ags, such as West Nile virus experimental vaccine (Alarcon et al. 1999) . In contrast to \"naked\" DNA vaccines, also known as \"third-generation vaccines,\" virus-based vaccines use recombinant viral vectors as natural vehicles to deliver foreign Ag-encoding sequences. The term \"vectored vaccine\" is generally used for live recombinant viruses or bacteria representing a natural carrier or \"vector\" capable of incorporating transgenes from a pathogen and expressing it in the host without itself causing illness. Viral vectors provide a substantially more efficient Ag delivery method, known as \"transduction,\" as compared to \"naked\" DNA. Besides, naked DNA-based vaccines were found to be unable to induce strong cellular immune responses in humans. By contrast, Ags delivered in the context of viral vectors are more immunogenic than the same Ags delivered as proteins or the Ag-encoding naked DNA. This is primarily due to the ability of mammalian innate immune system to recognize viruses as danger signals through Toll-like receptors, leading to the generation/integration of innate and adaptive immune responses for a more pronounced immune efficacy against the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1142, "end": 1163, "text": "(Alarcon et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Most virus-based vaccines contain Ag-coding sequences, replacing genes required for viral replication, and thus are replication deficient. Recently, vaccine design expanded towards replication-competent viral vectors. The advantage of replicative viruses as vectors is the dramatic (~10,000-fold) amplification of transgene and its expression because of excessive viral DNA replication. This enhances immunization efficiency and allows decreased vaccine dosing. The disadvantages include cell lysis, which typically occurs upon infection as the ultimate step in viral life cycle and may reduce the duration of transgene expression and vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, development of vaccines based on replication-competent viral vectors requires adequate animal models that should not only be immunocompetent but also fully permissive for replication of a given virus, which may not be available or cost permissive.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "An important benefit of using virus-based vaccines is the ability to modulate the efficiency and cell-type specificity of an Ag-encoding transgene delivery. This can be achieved through alteration of natural tropism of viral vectors, making possible an efficient and specific transduction of specific cell population/cell type, such as cancer or Ag-presenting cells (APCs). Various strategies for transductional retargeting of viral vectors have been developed in the recent years. A large variety of viral vector systems, each with its advantages and disadvantages, have been used for vaccine development.

Preexisting immunity (PEI), particularly Ag-specific antibodies (Abs) against many human viruses typically found in patients, significantly compromises clinical efficacy of the corresponding viral vectors when used for vaccine or gene therapy applications. Many strategies have been developed to circumvent PEI to virusbased vectors, some of which will be described in other sections. Low immunogenicity of some Ags may require a more complex regimen of vaccination involving a \"prime-boost\" approach that may combine two different vaccine types for repeated delivery of the same Ag: a DNA vaccine followed by a viral vaccine or vice versa. Many contemporary vaccines are designed using a polyvalent approach allowing immunization against more than one Ag, serological variant (serotype) of a given pathogen, or even several different pathogens simultaneously. Optimal vaccination protocols are developed by considering various factors, such as dose, route of administration, type of priming and boosting vectors, number of boost immunizations, and their timing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Conventional prophylactic, i.e., preventive, vaccines against infectious diseases have been highly effective at eliminating or drastically reducing incidence of many life-threatening diseases, such as smallpox and poliomyelitis. These vaccines are administered to the host prior to an encounter with pathogenic infectious agents, such as viruses or bacteria. A single exception is the rabies vaccine, developed by Pasteur more than 100 years ago, which is administered only after exposure to the virus. However, the application of therapeutic vaccines has recently been on the rise owing to significant technological developments and comprehensive understanding of the immune system. Unlike prophylactic vaccines that achieve their diseasepreventive effect by generating humoral immune responses, therapeutic vaccines often function through robust T-cell responses against key viral Ags. The contribution of humoral responses to the therapeutic efficacy of a vaccine depends on the target pathogen or disease. Therapeutic vaccines have been developed or under development for various indications, including persistent infections, such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, malaria, as well as noninfectious chronic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, gastric ulcers, prion-caused mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Immunologic control of persistent viral infections, such as HPV, HBV, and HCV causing a long-term damage to the host or the infected organ, has become the primary goal of therapeutic vaccine efforts.

While HPV, HBV, and HCV can be eliminated by the immune system after acute infection or sometimes in chronic phase, persistent HIV infection has proved more challenging. Although there are various contributing factors, the integration of HIV DNA into the genome of the virus-targeted immune T cells appears to play a determining role (Finzi et al. 1999) . Unlike prophylactic vaccines where the induction of effector immune responses against pathogens is the primary requirement for vaccine efficacy, therapeutic vaccines against chronic infections and cancer are required to overcome two major obstacles to achieve efficacy: (1) induction of effector immune responses in a host that may have developed tolerance to the pathogen or cancer Ags and (2) overcoming various immune evasion mechanisms employed by the chronic infection and progressing cancer. Furthermore, therapeutic vaccines are administered to patients with suppressed immunity due to prior chemo-and/or radiation therapy treatments and in already developed disease background.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 656, "end": 675, "text": "(Finzi et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus-Based Recombinant Vaccines"}, {"text": "Vaccine development has gone a long way to achieving success in controlling or fully eradicating a number of fatal infectious diseases.

AAV2 is the most commonly used serotype for transgene delivery. Although, the majority of the human population is seropositive for AAV, no significant adverse events during either pretrial efficacy studies or clinical trials involving AAV were observed (Maguire et al. 2009; Bainbridge et al. 2008) . The wild-type (wt) AAV integrates into a specific region of the human chromosome 19 (between q13.3 and q13.4) upon host cell infection (Kotin et al. 1992) , whereas this ability for site-specific integration is lost in rAAV, possibly due to deletion of the viral rep gene. Although the integrating gene delivery systems allow for a more stable transgene expression than the episomal ones, integration of foreign DNA in the cellular chromosomal DNA is associated with the risk of insertional mutagenesis. This, in turn, may cause malignant cell transformation (Romano 2012) . Therapeutic transgenes and internal promoters, regulating transgene expression in rAAV-based vectors, replace the viral rep and cap genes ( Fig. 8 .1) (Bartel et al. 2012) . Although AAV vectors are less immunogenic than adenoviral vectors, low transduction efficiency for certain tissues, inability for targeted delivery to specific cell types, relatively low transgene-carrying capacity (~4 kb), and dependence on a helper virus for propagation limit utility of these vectors for human clinical applications. However, several clinical trials with AAV have been performed. For example, a clinical trial in advanced cancer patients conducted in China evaluated the safety of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated by the coculture with dendritic cells (DCs) transduced with rAAV encoding carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA). This study demonstrated that infusion of CEA-specific CTL was well tolerated and showed no severe adverse reactions in cancer patients (Di et al. 2012) .

The Ad E1B gene product triggers proliferation of the infected cells (essential for Ad replication function) by inducing degradation of tumor suppressor p53 and the resulting block in p53-dependent apoptosis along with the activation of cell cycle signaling. The E1B mutation would, therefore, make an Ad unable to productively replicate in normal cells carrying a functional p53.

Owing to processing of the capsid-incorporated Ags through the exogenous pathways native to the Ad capsid proteins, the Ags could accrue their immunostimulatory potential. A strong humoral response against the incorporated Ags, similar to the one induced against the Ad capsid proteins, could result from the adjuvant function of the Ad vector. The \"Ag capsid incorporation\" strategy has also been applied to the human rhinovirus as a vector for vaccination against HIV. A chimeric human rhinovirus HIV was shown to stimulate immunity against HIV-1 (Smith et al. 1994 ). In addition, combinatorial libraries of human rhinovirus capsid-incorporated HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 (gp41) epitopes were shown to induce Abs with activity that can mimic the NAb effect (Arnold et al. 2009 ).

Since NAbs against bovine Ad3 (BAd3) have not been reported in humans, BAd3 have been evaluated for vaccine applications. In a mouse model, a single immunization of BAd3 encoding the HA Ag of H5N1 influenza induced greater levels of Ag-specific cellular immunity than the corresponding Ad5 vector, and this property was not compromised by Ad5 PEI (Singh et al. 2008) . Importantly, mice with Ad5 PEI that received a prime-boost regimen of BAd3-Ad5 vectors encoding HA were fully protected from lethal flu virus challenge. In contrast, mice treated by a homologous Ad5-Ad5 prime-boost regimen were not protected. Consequently, Ads of nonhuman species may induce strong responses and provide immune protection comparable or superior to those of Ad5, while retaining protective potential in the presence of Ad5 PEI. The use of alternative serotype Ads thus allows for improved induction of immune responses to vector re-administration in host that have Ad5 PEI (Abbink et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; McCoy et al. 2007) .

With respect to Ad immune response, humans have evolved under continuous exposure of their populations to human Ad species, as opposed to Ad species infecting nonhuman hosts. Consequently, it is possible that the human system of innate immunity reacts to the capsid proteins of nonhuman Ad species in a different way. It is also plausible that the human immune system induces a more robust innate response when challenged with different xenotype or rare serotype Ads than upon exposure to Ad serotypes native to humans (hAd2/5). Recently it has been demonstrated that the innate immune response to capsid proteins of alternative serotype Ads has not only been substantially more robust as compared to Ad5 but in some cases can cause toxicity in animal models (Abbink et al. 2007; Appledorn et al. 2008; Hartman et al. 2008; Hensley et al. 2007) .

Study of replicating Ad vaccines is difficult because the host/animal model system must support Ad replication if the vaccines are to be evaluated under conditions recapitulating their intended use in humans (Deal et al. 2013 ). Mice do not support human Ad replication. However, Syrian hamsters (Thomas et al. 2006a) , cotton rats, dogs, pigs, monkeys, and chimpanzees partially support replication of some human Ad vectors.

While many diseases have been controlled or essentially eradicated owing to vaccination, the goal to generate community immunity for a wide variety of diseases remains elusive due to a number of problems associated with current vaccines . A substantial amount of time and research efforts are directed towards determining which strains of influenza (flu) to include in the flu vaccine each year. In most years the vaccine matches quite closely to the current disease-causing strains of flu, while sometimes, despite all of the research efforts, the vaccine is not a good match and fails to provide adequate protection (Duda 2014) . Since fewer flu B cases have been identified as compared to flu A cases, there are two strains of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, and one strain of influenza B used in the current flu vaccine. The H3N2 strain of influenza A used in the vaccine is a good match to the H3N2 strain causing the majority of flu illnesses in the United States. During the 2012/2013 flu season, there have been two illness-causing influenza B strains. One of those strains was well matched by the flu vaccine, but the other was not. Therefore, patients who were vaccinated with this season's flu vaccine are likely to be well protected, while those who happened to contract the other strain of flu B that was not part of the vaccine may not have a good protection. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the flu vaccine has been about 61 % effective at protecting people from flu during the 2013-2014 mid-season for all age groups (CDC 2014). This number represents quite an impressive success rate for a vaccine. However, considering the emergence of new seasonal strains, the battle against flu should continue by changing the vaccine strain composition. In this regard, the development of a universal vaccine, capable of providing a broader spectrum of protection against the disease, would greatly benefit the community and is a task of highest priority. Traditional inactivated or live attenuated vaccines are fairly effective in protecting the population against seasonal flu by targeting a viral Ag, hemagglutinin (HA). However, in case of a pandemic caused by a new strain of influenza with high mortality rate in humans, such as H5N1, it is difficult to produce adequate amounts of an effective vaccine in a timely manner using the conventional egg-based production system because: (1) it takes at least 4 months to produce the first vaccine after the identification of a new potential strain (Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006) ;", "cite_spans": [{"start": 890, "end": 901, "text": "(Duda 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2829, "text": "(Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prophylactic Vaccines Against Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza"}, {"text": "(2) H5N1 viruses are extremely lethal to personnel, requiring biosafety level 3 containment facilities for the vaccine production; and (3) H5N1 viruses do not replicate well in chicken embryos, resulting in low yield of the virus for vaccine development ). In addition, the supply of eggs for vaccine production might be compromised during an H5N1 pandemic due to high mortality of the affected chickens. Overall, both inactivated and live attenuated H5N1 vaccines are only mildly immunogenic in humans, requiring high doses of Ag, multiple cycles of vaccination, and/or the use of adjuvants, further complicating the process (Adams and Sandrock 2010; Rockman and Brown 2010; Clayville 2011) . Furthermore, the live attenuated influenza vaccine is only approved for healthy people of ages 2 through 49 and excludes high-risk populations. Generally, the licensed platforms for manufacturing of the existing seasonal influenza vaccines are not ideal for an H5N1 pandemic scenario as experienced in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (Haaheim et al. 2009 ). Therefore, it is urgent to explore alternative vaccine strategies for pandemic influenza, capable of preventing or controlling H5N1 infection in a timely manner. Numerous vaccine types with egg-independent production technologies, such as mammalian cell-based vaccines, recombinant protein-based vaccines, virus-like particle-based vaccines, DNA vaccines, bacterial-vectored vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines, have been comprehensively studied as alternative options (Haaheim et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2010; Horimoto and Kawaoka 2009) . Included in the list of possible alternative strategies are recombinant Ad vector H5N1 vaccines, which are promising candidates capable of inducing a rapid and long-term cross-protective immunity against frequently evolving H5N1 viruses (Tutykhina et al. 2011; Tang et al. 2009; Vemula and Mittal 2010; Toro and Tang 2009; Lambe 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 651, "text": "(Adams and Sandrock 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 652, "end": 675, "text": "Rockman and Brown 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 676, "end": 691, "text": "Clayville 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1049, "text": "(Haaheim et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1545, "text": "(Haaheim et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1564, "text": "Singh et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1591, "text": "Horimoto and Kawaoka 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1854, "text": "(Tutykhina et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1872, "text": "Tang et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1896, "text": "Vemula and Mittal 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF311"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1916, "text": "Toro and Tang 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1928, "text": "Lambe 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prophylactic Vaccines Against Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza"}, {"text": "Comprehensive studies have shown that Ad vector-based vaccines induce humoral and cellular immune responses superior to those of recombinant protein vaccines, plasmid-based DNA vaccines, and other recombinant vector systems currently available (Abbink et al. 2007; Naslund et al. 2007; Barefoot et al. 2008) .

For example, parenteral administration is associated with diminished vaccine efficacy due to the presence of preexisting anti-Ad immunity. In marked contrast, vaccination via alternative routes was shown to overcome PEI against Ad5-based vectors (Van Kampen et al. 2005; Song et al. 2010; Holman et al. 2009; Appledorn et al. 2011; Xiang et al. 2003; Pandey et al. 2012) .

Current treatment options involve combinations (or \"cocktails\") of at least three different kinds of antiretroviral agents; however, the results are far from being satisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective prevention and treatment options for AIDS. In this context, development of effective vaccines has been the main focus of the governments, academic institutions, and the industry worldwide. There has been a rapid increase in preventive candidate vaccines against HIV utilizing various strategies, including DNA, protein, and viral vector-based vaccines (Gamble and Matthews 2010) . Initial efforts were focused on the development of traditional (first-generation) vaccines using inactivated or attenuated HIV virions. However, the advancements in molecular engineering and genebased vector development have led to the emergence of viral vector-based vaccines, eliciting robust immune responses against HIV (Casimiro et al. 2003) . The generation of humoral as well as cellular immunity, particularly involving CTL with long-lasting memory, is the desired features of HIV vaccines. The role and the importance of NAbs as well as CTL responses in preventing and controlling HIV infection have already been demonstrated (Sha et al. 2004 ). Among all viralvectored vaccine candidates (Table 8 .1), replication-defective Ad5 is the most widely used due to its proven efficacy in producing high titers of Ag-specific Abs and strong CTL responses, as well as high safety of intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) administration (McElrath and Haynes 2010; McElrath et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 372, "text": "Duerr et al. 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 961, "end": 987, "text": "(Gamble and Matthews 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1336, "text": "(Casimiro et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1641, "text": "(Sha et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1956, "text": "(McElrath and Haynes 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 1957, "end": 1978, "text": "McElrath et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1688, "end": 1696, "text": "(Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Prophylactic Vaccines Against Human Immunodeficiency Virus"}, {"text": "There have been several clinical trials using Ad5 vector-based vaccines against HIV.

However, Ad emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer only decades later, after the groundbreaking developments in recombinant DNA technology. Several clinical studies using Ad vectors for cancer therapy have been conducted in the past decade. Some of those led to the clinical development of Ad vector-based products for treatment of various cancers, such as Advexin \u00ae and Gendicine \u00ae encoding wt tumor suppressor p53 under control of cytomegalovirus or Rous Sarcoma Virus promoters, respectively (Raty et al. 2008) . Remarkably, in 2003 Gendicine \u00ae was approved in China as the first gene therapy medicine in the world (Toth et al. 2010 ). Onyx-015, an Ad2/Ad5 hybrid oncolytic virus replicating selectively in p53-defective cancers, became the first engineered replication-selective virus to be used in humans (Liu et al. 2008b) . In 2005 a similar virus (H101) in combination with chemotherapy was approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory nasopharyngeal (head and neck) cancer (Liu and Kirn 2008) . The current use of human Ad as a vector for cancer therapy applications can be divided into six major categories: (1) suicide gene therapy also known as genedirected enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), (2) suppressor replacement gene therapy, (3) RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene therapy, (4) anti-angiogenic therapy, (5) oncolytic virotherapy, and (6) cancer immunotherapy. Briefly, the GDEPT approach utilizes the concept of foreign (bacterial or viral) enzymemediated intracellular conversion of nontoxic compounds (prodrugs), compatible with systemic administration, into cytotoxic metabolites capable of blocking DNA replication or transcription/protein synthesis in target (cancer) cells upon vectormediated delivery of the foreign enzyme-encoding transgenes (\"suicide\" genes). Due to inability of cellular enzymes to use such prodrugs as substrates, the cytotoxic effect is achieved specifically in target (cancer) cells expressing the delivered therapeutic transgenes.

Immunotherapy relies on preformed effector mechanisms and is well suited for the treatment of established tumors. In this context, cancer vaccines based on whole tumor cells, DCs pulsed with tumor-associated Ags (TAAs), or TAA-based subunit vaccines with immune adjuvants have recently emerged as important modalities to combat cancer.

Thus, replicative Ad vectors, especially oncolytic vectors \"armed\" with transgenes encoding immunomodulatory factors, play an important role as adjuvant components of therapeutic cancer vaccines. It should be noted, however, that expressing TAAs in the context of highly potent oncolytic Ads may not be always an optimal vaccination strategy because of potentially short duration of transgene expression in the CRAd-infected cells due to the rapidly developing cytopathic effect leading to oncolytic cell destruction. Furthermore, attempts have been made to augment the immunotherapeutic potential of oncolytic Ads by vector incorporation of heat shock proteins as transgenes. Since heat shock proteins act as chaperones facilitating protein folding and translocation, their overexpression in cancer cells augments adaptive antitumor T-cell immunity by stimulating the processing and presentation of TAAs to T cells via APCs (Wang et al. 2001 (Wang et al. , 2006 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1426, "end": 1443, "text": "(Wang et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1463, "text": "(Wang et al. , 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF318"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Oncolytic Adenovirus-Based Cancer Vaccines"}, {"text": "Ad-based vaccines can be used in conjunction with APCs, particularly with DCs.

Ad vectors have been extensively used to transduce and modify DCs, either for effective TAA delivery and presentation to effector T cells or for their activation, i.e., induction of DC-mediated Ag-specific immune responses. Upon activation DCs migrate to the draining lymph nodes (LNs) and simultaneously upregulate costimulatory molecules and cytokines to prime both T helpers (Th) and CTLs in paracortical areas of LNs ( Fig. 8.4) . DCs thus provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity. A number of studies have demonstrated that ex vivo transduction of DCs with Ad vectors encoding TAAs and their expression in DCs results in induction of antitumor immunity upon DC inoculation back in tumorbearing animals (Xia et al. 2006) . Immune activation of DCs can be induced by delivering immunostimulatory factors or by genetic modification of the Ad5 capsid fiber protein (Worgall et al. 2004) , for instance, with CD40 ligand, which binds to CD40 receptor, highly expressed on DCs (Fig. 8.4) .

For in vivo vaccination, retargeted Ad-vectored vaccines with genetically modified fiber and/or complexed with adapter is injected intradermally into the patient to target DCs in their natural environment.

An example of such contemporary cancer vaccine-based therapy is the recently FDA-approved first ever vaccine for therapy of cancer called sipuleucel-T also known under commercial name of Provenge \u00ae (Dendreon, Inc.). Although formulation of this vaccine does not involve Ad-based gene delivery, it is important to mention here with regard to the underlying approach the clinical outcomes and historical significance of the treatment approval. This cell-based vaccine is created by isolating APCs from individual patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and culturing them with a fusion protein called PA2024, consisting of PAP prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP; an Ag that is expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells but not on non-prostate tissues), linked to cytokine GM-CSF (PAP-GM-CSF). APCs cultured in the presence of PAP-GM-CSF display increased amounts of costimulatory molecules on their surface and constitute the active component of sipuleucel-T. These activated APCs are eventually infused back into the APC donor patient for treatment. In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, sipuleucel-T increased the overall survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients by 4 months, however failed to induce tumor regression. Although the exact therapeutic mechanism remains elusive, the treatment appears to favor older patients. On the downside, the underlying personalized approach makes the treatment laborious, technically complex, and extremely expensive (Small et al. 2006; Gulley and Drake 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1697, "end": 1716, "text": "(Small et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1739, "text": "Gulley and Drake 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IL-2 interleukin-2,"}, {"text": "While there are some obstacles that have been identified in the use of Ads as cancer vaccine carriers, extensive knowledge of Ad biology has enabled researchers to develop methods to effectively overcome these obstacles.

In the past 20 years, recombinant Ad vectors expressing a variety of Ags have been constructed and tested for immunization in various settings. However, Ad infection induces pathogenic inflammatory responses in immunocompetent hosts, including humans, even if the viral vector does not replicate, as early Ad gene expression alone is responsible for the pathogenic reaction. The inflammation consists of an early phase, in which TNF-\u03b1 plays a major role and a late phase consisting of an extensive T-cell response (Ginsberg 1996; Imler 1995) . In addition, PEI to Ads is a major impediment for vectors derived from common human serotypes, such as 5 or 2. Preexisting NAbs against these serotypes can be found in up to 90 % of human adults depending on age and geographic region (Chen et al. 2010) . Preexisting NAbs limit Ad-delivered transgene expression, thereby reducing the immune efficacy of the vaccine to the target Ag. A series of approaches have been entertained to circumvent the negative impact of preexisting NAbs, which include genetic modifications of Ad vectors or the use of those isolated from different species, such as chimpanzees (Fitzgerald et al. 2003) . Another strategy to avoid vector PEI is to genetically alter the natural tropism of the vector to improve its selective targeting to CD40 receptor on DCs in situ, thus making generation of autologous DCs more efficient and inexpensive (Hangalapura et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 767, "end": 782, "text": "(Ginsberg 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 783, "end": 794, "text": "Imler 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1049, "text": "(Chen et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1427, "text": "(Fitzgerald et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1690, "text": "(Hangalapura et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Remarks"}, {"text": "One of the important features of Ad-based vectors is the induction of strong CD8 + T-and B-cell responses.

The noninvasive mucosal vaccination of Ad vectors minimizes systemic inflammation, because preexisting Ad5 immunity does not interfere appreciably with the potency of an Ad-vectored nasal vaccine. Nasal administration of Ad vectors encoding Ags derived from selected pathogens not only provides a painless and practical means of immunization but also generates rapid and sustained protection against the pathogens.

These strategies of developing virus chimerism address the most relevant drawbacks to clinical implementation of virus-based therapies, including those that have been identified very recently such as blood coagulation factor-mediated liver tropism of Ads (Waddington et al. 2008; Kalyuzhniy et al. 2008) . Safety and increased therapeutic efficiency in clinical settings have already been demonstrated by several chimeric Ads (Koski et al. 2010; Pesonen et al. 2010) . All these new insights and developments led to a high number of possible combinatorial treatment modalities and delivery schemes. This calls for careful preclinical evaluation in relevant ex vivo human models and transitional in vivo tumor models, before clinical translation. To bring optimized combinations of retargeted Ad configurations and adjuvants in optimized heterologous prime-boost schedules to the clinic will be a major effort both in terms of time and cost (de Gruijl and van de Ven 2012). We consider that the most promising approaches to Ad-based immune response are (1) incorporation of heterologous Ag into Ad capsid, (2) a DC-targeted Ad vaccines, and (3) an oncolytic Ads armed with both Ag and immunomodulatory transgenes. Therefore, it is reasonable to view certain properties and components of the immune system as allies, rather than enemies, taking advantage of them for improving efficacy of cancer and other disease-targeted vaccines. In this regard, by making a part of the solution what has previously been viewed as a problem, we expect to observe more Ad-based cancer vaccines achieving clinical efficacy in the years to come.",
