He was admitted fifteen days later with a two day history of fever, shortness of breath and a productive cough. He had not had recent contact with camels or people with a similar illness.

Here, we report successful recovery of a patient with HIV/AIDS from MERS CoV pneumonia. The clinical presentation of this patient with MERS CoV pneumonia is similar to previously reported non-HIV infected cohorts in terms of symptoms, laboratory and radiological abnormalities [1]. Given the patient's lack of contact with similarly ill patients at home and the recent hospital admission during a period where several patients were confirmed to have MERS CoV infection, it is likely that the patient had contracted the virus during his hospital stay. The patient continued to shed MERS CoV, evidenced by the persistently positive MERS CoV RT-PCR sputum samples, for 38 days. CD4 helper cells play an integral role in initiating an effective immune response to clear MERS CoV [4]. Viral shedding (positive MERS CoV RT-PCR sputum samples) was prolonged in immunocompromised patients compared to healthy individuals in cases of seasonal influenza [5], [6], as well as H1N1pandamic virus [7]. In a case series, six of 10 HIV-infected individuals had H1N1pandamic virus detected by RT-PCR 2\u201310 days after starting treatment with oseltamivir [8]. However, since no data exist regarding the duration of MERS CoV shedding in immunocompetent population, it is difficult to determine whether the duration of shedding in this patient was prolonged and whether the patient's low CD4 count in addition to steroids have slowed the clearance of MERS CoV.",

            "text": "The decision to initially treat with interferon \u03b12a in combination with ribavirin was based on in vitro studies that showed strong inhibitory effects of interferon \u03b12b on MERS CoV replication [9], which was supported by studies on animal models that received early treatment with interferon \u03b12b in combination with ribavirin [10]. Interferon \u03b12a was used instead of interferon \u03b12b due to lack of availability of the latter. This may have played a role in the initial lack of improvement in the patient's clinical condition. Moreover, recent data by Hart et al. demonstrated superior in vitro activity of interferon \u03b2 compared to other different interferon products, including interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b [3]. Therefore, in view of the lack of improvement in the patient's clinical condition coupled with persistence of sputum samples positivity for MERS CoV PCR. The decision was made to switch interferon \u03b12a to interferon \u03b21a. Given the lack of data regarding the effective doses, we initiated therapy with interferon \u03b21a 44 \u03bccg subcutaneously 3 times weekly. While the only human data available on utilizing the combination of interferon \u03b12b and ribavirin was a case series of 5 patients, and a mortality rate of 100% [11], there are no human data regarding the efficacy of interferon \u03b21a in combination with ribavirin to treat MERS CoV pneumonia. Therefore, it is not possible to simply attribute the successful outcome in this patient to this treatment. Nonetheless, interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b2 are necessary to activate CD8 T-cell response. It maybe possible, that the exogenous administration of interferon \u03b1 followed by interferon \u03b2 have led to activation of CD8 cells [12], and hence aided in subsequent clearance of the MERS CoV virus. This however, should be verified in a prospective controlled manner. In summary, we report a successful recovery of a patient with HIV/AIDS from MERS CoV pneumonia. To date, this is the only reported case of MERS CoV pneumonia in a patient with HIV/AIDS. The difference in the viral shedding duration between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and the impact of this on treatment decisions deserve evaluation in comparative studies.",
