Different species of bats in China carry 79 genetically diverse coronaviruses, some of which are direct ancestors of SARS-CoV 11-13 . 80 Indeed, the first SARS-CoV that caused a human outbreak derived from SARS-like CoV 81 circulating in Chinese horseshoe Rhinolophus bats which apparently adapted to wild 82 Himalayan palm-civet before spreading in humans 14 . The MERS-CoV originated from a 83 Pipistrellus bat CoV and was probably transmitted to humans through contact with infected 84 camels 15-17 . Soon after the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it was reported that this 85 new virus was related to a bat-borne coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) present in the 86 Rhinolophus affinis bat species 18 . The identification of an intermediate animal hosts has been 87 the subject of intense research and it was claimed that a pangolin (Manis javanica) was the 88 intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 19 . The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 from bat and 89 pangolin and several other species, were found to resemble that of human 20 . 90 Before 2003, although human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Alphacoronavirus) and 91 HCoV-OC43 (Betacoronavirus lineage a) described in the 1960s were known to be agents of 92 respiratory infections, they lent little attention. In the early 2000s, two other coronaviruses 93 responsible for similar diseases were identified, the HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus) and",

A study in 96 Switzerland reported that among 279 subjects who had bronchoalveolar lavage for 97 investigation of respiratory symptoms, 29 were tested positive for HCoV (detection rate: 98 10.4%) 21 . A large-scale polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of 11,661 nasal samples 99 from European patients with respiratory disease, found 35 HCoV-229E (0.30%), 61 HCoV-100 HKU1 (0.52%), 75 HCoV-NL63 (0.64%), and 111 HCoV-OC43 (0.85%) 22 . A similar study 101 in Africa on 5,573 nasal samples from child hospitalized for pneumonia found 114 HCoV- able to spread from person-to-person leading to a fatality rate of 9.6% in infected patients, 112 causing global concern. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by the The MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and their cellular receptors 125 Already for SARS-CoV, it was demonstrated that this virus used the angiotensin I converting 126 enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells 29 . The novel Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 127 (formerly 2019-nCoV), that cause COVID-19 disease, has 79.5% nucleotide identity with 128 SARS-CoV 1 . It is worth noting that HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike 129 proteins bind ACE2 30 expressed at high levels in type I and II alveolar cells in the lung, 130 whereas MERS-CoV bind the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)/CD26), a multifunctional serine 131 peptidase known involved in T cell activation 31 . The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 132 protein and ACE2 three-dimensional (3-D) structures allowed identification of regions in the 133 peptidase domain of ACE2 required for viral spike binding 3 . Three very elegant papers 134 published in the recent weeks characterized SARS-CoV-2 entry in target cells through 135 interactions with ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 priming as well as the 3-D structures 136 involved in these interactions 3, 32, 33 .",

            "text": "The human monocarboxypeptidase ACE-2 was originally cloned from human heart failure 138 and lymphoma cDNA libraries 7 . Although the ACE2 gene is usually considered silent in 139 immune cells, the expression of ACE2 mRNAs was reported in a subset of CD14+ CD16-140 human monocytes 34 . ACE2 is also expressed by enterocytes of the small intestine and 141 expected to regulate the expression of the gut antimicrobial peptides 35 . Moreover, this 142 peptidase is also present on the arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth 143 muscle 36 . In normal human lung, the ACE2 protein is found on type I and II alveolar 144 epithelial lung cells 37 . High expression of ACE2 was also reported on the epithelial cells of sometimes observed in clinic. We therefore suggest that quantification of ACE2 and AngII be 294 added to the COVID-19 patients biological monitoring. 295 It is known that ACE2 can shift the RAAS balance by conversion of Ang II to Ang (1-7) . 296 Consequently, HT and COVID-19 recently become a question of concern for international 297 professional societies of cardiology regarding: i) the susceptibility of patients with HT to get 298 COVID-19; ii) the severity of the disease; and, iii) the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and 299 AngII receptor blockers (ARBs, that targets the AT 1 R). It is known that HT inhibitors such drugs on ACE2 mRNA expression in lung epithelial cells, there is a concern that patients 303 taking those treatments can favor virus capture. In patients with HT who received long-term 304 olmesartan (ARB) treatment, urinary ACE2 levels were higher than among untreated control 305 patients 103 . In contrast to HT, in patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the 306 expression levels of ACE2 are markedly decreased 30 . ACE2 is a major actor toward 307 resolution of inflammation and fibrosis 104 . In an animal model of bleomycin-induced 308 pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human ACE2 309 improved the lung function and decreased lung inflammation and fibrosis 105 . Moreover, 310 impaired phosphorylation of ACE2 Ser680 by AMP-activated protein kinase in pulmonary 311 endothelium leads to a labile ACE2 and hence pulmonary HT 106 . We must also paid attention 312 to molecules such as xanthenone (XNT) and dimiazene aceturate (DIZE, an anti-313 trypanosomal drug) described as ACE2 activators 107 . In a rat model of ischemic heart disease, The mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 during severe COVD-19 353 disease might be related to the inhibition of ACE2 catalytic activity 126 . (Figure 2) . 354 Interestingly, a recent study posted as a pre-print paper 127 ",

The histidine motif HEXXH identified as an important component in a wide 162 variety of zinc-dependent metalloproteases consists of five residues, the first histidine 163 followed by glutamic acid being conserved, then the two variable amino acids and a final 164 histidine 43 . Crystal structure analysis have suggested the presence of several hinge regions 165 and N-glycosylations 44 . 166 ACE2 belongs to the family of ACE members which have a wider tissues distribution. The 167 juxtamembrane, transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 do not resemble ACE but these 168 two proteins share the CLD region, a 220 amino-acid domain. Angiotensin converting 169 enzymes (ACE) are zinc metallopeptidases. ACE, is a widely distributed protein of 170 kDa 170 encoded by a 21 kb gene located on chromosome 17 (17q23) 45,46 , that converts the inactive 171 decapeptide, angiotensin (Ang) I to an active vasoconstrictor octapeptide Ang II [Asp-Arg-172 Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe] that controls the blood pressure 47-50 , and through inactivation of 173 bradykinin vasodilatator 51 . AngII also triggers the release of aldosterone that regulates the 174 capacity of kidney to absorb sodium and water 52 . Moreover, Ang II stimulates DPP4 activity 175 likely via the seven-transmembrane receptor (7TM) angiotensin II type A receptor (AT 1 R)-176 mediated transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor 53 and DPP4 inhibitors are 177 described as a new class of anti-diabetic treatments the cardiovascular safety of which has 178 been confirmed whereas their impact on hypertension is under evaluation 54 . Ang II also 179 mediates cell proliferation by stimulating various cytokines 55 . ACE2, known for its diverse 180 biological functions, including regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-181 aldosterone system (RAAS), converts the octapeptide AngII to the heptapeptide Ang(1-7) by 182 hydrolysis of the C-terminal residue. Ang(1-7) is expect to exert its action through the MAS-183 related (MAS1) G protein-coupled receptor (GPGR) 56,57 . In the pancreas ACE2 play an 184 important glycemia-protective role 58 . Low ACE2 expression in the kidney is also associated 185 with progressive renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy 59 . A soluble form of the 186 catalytic ACE2 ectodomain can be released in the circulation following cleavage between 187 amino acids 716 and 741 by sheddase ADAM10 and ADAM17 60-62 .

ACE2 receptor polymorphism and coronaviruses infection 220 It remains possible that ACE2 gene polymorphism, human ACE2 mRNA expression and 221 human ACE2 protein polymorphism influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 222 disease outcome. 223 For more than two decades, in the field of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a 224 retrovirus transmitted by sexual intercourse, it was demonstrated that the binding of the gp120 225 viral envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor 80,81 , to CXCR4 82,83 or CCR5 coreceptor 84 , 226 triggers cell signaling. These molecules play a crucial role in the permanent molecular 227 crosstalk between the cell and its environment. In this viral model, the study of the CCR5 co-228 receptor polymorphism clearly showed that a natural \u220632 deletion prevented the infection by 229 HIV of homozygous people carrying this genotype 85, 86 . For the MERS-CoV, attachment of 230 the spike (S) glycoprotein to human cells require the host cell typeII transmembrane protein 231 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) 87,88 . Following interaction with DPP4, the S protein of 232 MERS-CoV undergoes proteolytic activation through the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 233 and cysteine protease cathepsin L once inside endosomes 89 . Soluble forms of DPP4 can be 234 released in the blood circulation after cleavage by the kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) 235 90 . It was recently reported that among fourteen characterized mutants forms of DPP4, four 236 polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and \u2206346-348) strongly reduce the binding and 237 penetration of MERS-CoV into target cells and the viral replication 91 . 238 Regarding SARS-CoV, the S1 domain of the spike protein mediates ACE2 receptor binding 239 whereas the S2 domain is a membrane-associated portion that likely undergoes post-binding 240 transconformational modifications allowing membrane fusion. The viral receptor binding 241 domain (RBD) located in S1 has been narrowed down to amino acid residues 318 to 510 92 . A 242 co-crystal structure of ACE2 to the RBD revealed that residues 424 to 494 are involved in 243 direct contact with the first \u03b1-helix and Lys353 and proximal residues at the N-terminus of \u03b2-244 sheet 5 of ACE2 93 . By altering the His353 amino acid in rat ACE2 and modifying a 245 glycosylation site (Asp 90) that may alter the conformation of the \u03b1-helix 1 of ACE2, Li and 246 colleagues 93 converted the rat ACE2 into an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV. A point 247 mutation Leu584Ala in ACE2, markedly attenuated the shedding of the enzyme and 248 facilitated SARS-CoV entry into target cells 61 . A soluble form of ACE2 lacking the 249 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of the molecule was reported capable of blocking 250 binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 94 . Expression of ACE2 was found down 251 regulated in cells infected by SARS-CoV 95 . A recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein was 252 found to down regulated ACE2 expression through release of sACE2 and thereby promotes 253 lung injury 96 . Among other antiviral effect of Chloroquine on SARS-CoV in vitro one could 254 be attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation of the ACE2 virus cell surface receptor 97, 98 . 255 Regarding the HCoV-NL63 that also employ ACE2 for cell entry a recombinant SARS-256 CoV/HCoV-NL63 spike protein trigger shedding of sACE2 99 . 257 Very recently, investigation of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through ACE2 binding showed 258 important commonalities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including similar choice of entry receptors 32 . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share about 76% amino acids 260 identity and most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding were conserved in the 261 SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 domain. Another recent paper published reported the structural basis 262 of SARS-CoV2 interaction with ACE2 3 . The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike binds the PD 263 domain of ACE2 and the cleavage of ACE2 C-terminal segment (residues 697 to 716) by the 264 transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) enhances the S-protein-driven viral entry. By 265 comparing the 805 amino acid residues of the 10 human ACE2 proteins and the 4 different 266 ACE2 isoforms available through GeneBank using Clustal Omega multiple sequence 267 alignment, a 100% identity among the complete ACE2 sequences was observed and the 268 isoforms corresponded to a deletion in the CLD domain, or truncation in the transmembrane 269 domain. The role of these isoforms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, 270 remains speculative. According to the recent work by Cao and colleagues 41 , 32 variants of 271 ACE2 where characterized among which seven hotspot variants (Lys26Arg, Ile486Val, 272 Ala627Val, Asn638Ser, Ser692Pro, Asn720Asp, and Leu731Ile/Phe) in different populations 273 (Figure 1B).

It can be hypothesized that the ACE2 levels correlate with 280 susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apparently, men have a higher ACE2 expression in 281 lung than women and Asian people express ACE2 higher than Caucasian and African 282 American populations 37 . This is in agreement with the finding that conversion of Ang II to 283 Ang (1-7) by ACE2 was higher in males than female 100 , suggesting an over-expression of 284 ACE2 in men. Because ACE2 is encoded by a gene located on the X chromosome and men 285 express more ACE2 than women it could be speculated that depending the allele expressed by 286 women, they could be considered of lower sensitivity against the most severe adverse effects 287 of the infection 99, 101 . All clinical reports published to date indicate that men represent 288 between 66% and 75% of the most severe cases of COVID-19. During early SARS-CoV-2 289 infection and viral spread within body tissues, the ACE2 function is likely impaired either by 290 steric hindrance of the peptidase domain of ACE2 following virus binding or by down 291 regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein.

In addition, it was recently 319 reported that heparin (anticoagulant) treatment is associated with decreased mortality in 320 severe COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy 110 .321In a Chinese cohort of 1,099 patients with COVID-19, 165 (13%) individuals were patients 322 with HT, among which 24% suffered from severe COVID-19, a percentage of 3.7%, slightly 323 higher to that of the general population of COVID-19 patients111 . In a smaller cohort of 191 324 patients with COVID-19, 58 (30%) were patients with hypertension and 48% of them died, 325 which is surprisingly high percentage (14.6%)112 . These results suggest that the prevalence of 326 patients with HT was higher in patients who developed severe COVID-19 disease than those 327 who do not. By mid march 2020, the international professional societies of cardiology 328 recommended continuing patients' treatment113 . Indeed, when the SARS-CoV-2 spike binds 329 its ACE2 receptor in the \u03b1 helix 1 (Lys31, Tyr 41) and \u03b25 region (Lys353) it likely reduces 330 the catalytic properties of ACE2 that is usually associated with reduced inflammation.

Since it is known that Ang(1-7) 346 prevents inflammation by inhibiting the resistin/ Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MAPK/NF-kB 347 pathway 123 and that there is a high variability of the TLR4 gene in different ethnic groups in 348 Iran 124 , it remains possible that SARS-CoV-2 triggers increased inflammation in Iranian 349 patients by suppressing the ACE2-mediated metabolism of AngII to Ang(1-7).
