            "text": "Ethyl dibromofluoroacetate (EDBFA) represents a commercially available source of fluorine, which is highly valuable for the synthesis of a variety of fluorinated compounds. Since the isolation of elemental fluorine by Henri Moissan, numerous applications with fluorinated molecules have emerged in various fields, such as nuclear industry, material science, agrochemicals, and medicinal chemistry.1 Nowadays, fluorine is an essential element in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals with, respectively, about 25% and 40% of the new biologically active molecules that contain at least one fluorine atom.2 This strong interest for fluorinated molecules is due to the particular physical and chemical characteristics of fluorine, especially its small size and strong electronegativity, which impact the properties of fluorinated molecules themselves.3 Fluorinated natural products are rare.4 Hence organic synthesis is a major tool to access fluorinated molecules. Synthesis of those molecules is a challenging task as most of the reactions developed for the synthesis of non-fluorinated ones can't be transposed directly to fluorinated building blocks.",

This account will gather and comment all the publications dealing with the use of EDBFA in organic synthesis from our research group as well as others, especially those implying the use of organometallic reagents. The diverse functionalities (two highly electrophilic carbon centers and exchangeable bromine atoms) of EDBFA have opened the door to a panel of reactions, giving easy access to relevant fluorinated compounds, such as fluoroolefins, fluorocyclopropanes, fluoro-\u03b2-lactams. On the other hand, the multiple functionalities of EDBFA require a control of the regioselectivity of those reactions.",

In the eighties, Takeuchi studied the synthesis of compounds bearing four different labile groups, including a carbonyl group, halogen, and other heteroatom-containing groups (nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) from \u03b1-halo-\u03b1-fluoroesters, among which EDBFA.5 This task turned out to be difficult due to the influence of each functional group on the reactivity of another. The first approach consisted in the electrophilic functionalization of \u03b1-fluoroenolates (Li, Na) or enol silyl ethers. However attempts to react them with nitrogen or sulfur electrophiles failed to produce the desired tri- or tetrafunctional compounds, probably because of the presence of multiple labile groups on the same carbon or because of the poor reactivity of the \u03b1-fluoroenolate towards heteroaromatic electrophiles. Nucleophilic displacement of one bromine atom using NaSPh, NaSEt, NaOEt, and NaOCH2Ph afforded the corresponding reduced products whereas the use of NaN3 as a nucleophile under phase-transfer conditions led to the corresponding azido derivative 1 in 47% yield (Scheme 1\n). On the other hand, treatment of EDBFA with HNEt2 to introduce an amino group failed and unexpectedly yielded Et2NC(O)CO2Et.",

Reaction of diethylzinc with EDBFA gives rise to a mixture of E- and Z-enolates (see Transition states A and B, Scheme 17\n). Each of them reacts with the aldehyde via a chair-like transition state to produce, respectively, the zinc aldolate A-I and B-I. Reaction of diethylzinc with aldolate A-I affords the (Z)-\u03b1-fluoroacrylate (Z)-19 via an E2-elimination process, which is permitted because of the antiperiplanar arrangement of the bromine atom and the zinc ethoxy leaving group. In the case of aldolate B-I, the bromine atom and the leaving group are not in an antiperiplanar relationship, which prevents an E2-elimination and consequently the formation of the (E)-\u03b1-fluoroacrylate 19. Equilibrium to aldolate B-II would permit the E2-elimination to occur. However, this conformation is excluded because of the destabilizing non-bonding 1,3-diaxial interactions between R1 and the OEt group. As a consequence, aldolate B-II remains as such in the reaction mixture and provides the syn-\u03b1-bromo-\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-hydroxyester 10 upon acidic work-up.",

The chromium salt can be used alone in excess (4.5 equiv) or in substoichiometric quantity (50 mol %) in combination with Mn/TMSCl regeneration system. Ketones are also suitable for this transformation giving high level of diastereoselectivity but moderate yields.

One the other hand, when 4 equiv of Et2Zn were added to a solution of ketone, EDBFA (2 equiv), and PPh3 (4 equiv) in THF, complete conversion to the corresponding fluorinated epoxides was observed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. However, the large residual amount of triphenylphosphine and the instability of the desired products during the purification by silica gel column chromatography permitted the isolation of only two fluorinated epoxides. Further studies on this reaction led to the identification of N,N-dimethylethanolamine in combination with diethylzinc (to form ethylzinc N,N-dimethylaminoethoxide) for the efficient preparation of a variety of fluorinated epoxides (Scheme 26\n). The conversion of ketones was complete after 3 h of reaction and the fluorinated epoxides 30 were isolated in high yields and with good purity by simple liquid-liquid extraction. A good cis/trans diastereoselectivity was obtained in few cases. Due their instability as pure compounds, fluorinated epoxides are better kept in solution in most cases. Concerning the mechanism, it was observed that EDBFA doesn't react with ethylzinc N,N-dimethylaminoethoxide. However, addition of Et2Zn to a solution of EDBFA and a ketone led to the zinc alkoxide 31 (Scheme 26) (the corresponding bromofluorohydrin was isolated after aqueous work up), which upon addition of ethylzinc N,N-dimethylaminoethoxide, gave the desired fluorinated epoxide 30.

EDBFA can be used as such, or after modification of one of its functionality, to further build new fluorinated systems, such as \u03b1-bromo-\u03b1-fluorohydroxyesters, fluoroolefins, fluoro-\u03b2-lactams, fluoroaziridines, fluoroepoxides, fluorocyclopropanes, fluorodienes\u2026 Those fluorinated building blocks find applications in various fields, such as pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals.",
