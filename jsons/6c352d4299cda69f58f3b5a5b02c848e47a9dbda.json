We first highlight the relevance of interpreting the early stage of the epidemic in light of incoming infectious travelers from abroad. Next, we critically evaluate certain proposed solutions to contain the epidemic based on instantaneous modifications of the reproductive number. Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic models, ranging from simple homogeneous models used to estimate local reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or stochastic) models incorporating mobility estimates from cell phone location data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the official number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models, focusing on the validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future modeling efforts to exercise great care in the interpretation of long-term forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by numerical simulations.",

As of May 2020, around 4 million cases have been detected worldwide, with over 284,000 reported deaths. Great efforts are currently underway towards the characterization of the virus and the treatment of its disease. Without the possibility of a vaccine envisioned for the near future, disease containment has focused mainly on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at restricting the circulation of the population, as well as at reducing the risk of contagion in groups of vulnerable individuals. The choice of containment strategy is a key factor to forecast the local severity of the epidemic, as evidenced by the outcome of divergent public health policies adapted by different countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of models to assess the outcome of alternative NPIs will play an important role in the formulation of new public health policies.",

It is then reasonable to build upon previous knowledge when attempting to forecast the evolution of the pandemic. Previous relevant work includes Refs. [3] and [4] , where datadriven agent based models were developed for modeling the spread of seasonal influenza. In [5] the authors developed a structured meta-population scheme integrating a stochastic model for disease dynamics, with high-resolution worldwide census data and human mobility patterns at the global scale. In [6] , the authors proposed a theoretical framework for the study of spreading processes in structured meta-populations with heterogeneous agents, subject to different recurrent mobility patterns. All these examples highlight the need for a data-driven approach capable of generating effective descriptions of complex contact patterns [7] , and for the development of methods allowing the reuse of empirical contact matrices estimated from different demographics [8] .",

Using this method, the author found a basic reproduction number of R 0 \u2248 2.6 by adjusting the infection rate to reproduce the accumulated number of cases reported during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Japan. As Preprint submitted to Chaos, Solitons & Fractals May 13, 2020 another example, in [10] the authors developed a variant of the SEIR model without a compartment for exposed individuals (a SIR model) to fit data obtained from different regions of China, also estimating the local basic reproduction number.",

For instance, in [11] the authors analyzed a multi-compartmental SEIR model to estimate the maximal intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity required in the city of Santiago, Chile, during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, while taking different values of the basic reproduction number into account. In [12] the authors adapted a meta-population mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in Spain, incorporating empirical epidemiological parameters as well as mobility and census data. The Ferguson group at Imperial College built upon the previously mentioned models for the spread of influenza [3, 4] , with the purpose of estimating the effect of different potential public health measures, with a focus on Great Britain and the United States of America (USA) [13] . Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). One of the most controversial proposed NPI is the formulation of periodic quarantines, which in Ferguson's report are regulated by the availability and saturation of ICU beds. This idea was taken up in [14] , where the authors proposed a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10day lockdown, based on the predictions of a SEIR model with an ad-hoc square function modulation of the time dependent reproduction number R(t).",

Different countries have achieved this objective with varying degrees of success, which can at least be partially explained by their choice of NPIs. Thus, it becomes essential to measure the relative success of each case and to incorporate this knowledge into models capable of assisting decision makers in the formulation of new NPIs. As mentioned before, a key parameter that reflects the dynamics of the epidemics is the reproduction number. However, in [19] authors found that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number R 0 is untenable in realistic populations, and provides very little understanding of the evolution of the epidemic. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral factors and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. The authors also provided evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) can be used operationally to characterize the correct dynamics of the epidemic from incidence data.",

They combined data from Tencent (a large social media and technology company) with a networked dynamic meta-population model with Bayesian inference to analyze the early spread within China. Recently, in [13] the authors used a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to infer the impact of NPIs across 11 European countries.

It is important to note that even though NPIs can have a noticeable effect on the reproduction number R(t), their effects are not instantaneous; instead, they are modulated by the proper characteristic times of the disease. Since R(t) is an emergent quantity resulting from decreased social contact in large groups of individuals, proposals depending on the capacity to enforce sudden changes of the reproduction number (e.g. as in the modulation of infection rate by a periodic square function, as mentioned above) must be evaluated critically. One of the keys points for understanding the spreading of the disease is the variability in the contagion rate and its dependence on the density and movement of people within or between cities and regions. In this context, in [22] the authors used cell phone data from approximately 11 million devices to study how the flow of people through the city of Wuhan contributed to dispersing SARS-CoV-2 throughout China. The authors confirmed the efficacy of lockdown measures for decreasing mobility, and showed that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicted the relative frequency and geographic distribution of COVID-19 infections across China.",

We caution the reader to adopt a critical stance towards simple epidemiological models. Even when these models are fed with population census data and realistic mobility estimates, they are fundamentally limited in what they can tell us about the mid-to long-term evolution of the epidemic. While the simplest epidemiological models have several limitations of their own, building more complex models does not necessarily improve our understanding of the epidemic, and can certainly obfuscate the basic limitations that are intrinsic to the very foundations of the models. Here, models are considered only as ways of exploring the possible future courses of the epidemic, without claims of accuracy, let alone of infallibility. Claims concerning the outcomes of public policies based solely on numerical simulations should be approached with utmost care. The situation is both novel and challenging, full of unknowns that cannot be dispelled by comparison with previous epidemics, and several of the proposed NPIs (such as the enforcement of periodic lockdowns, or the pursuit of massive herd immunity) are unheard of in modern public health policy. The cost of implementing such policies could be huge, and failures could be even costlier. When advising public policy makers, it is our position that models, no matter how detailed, only represent one among multiple sources of information, and should supplement the analysis of actual data, the epidemiological situation, and the advice of public health experts.",

In our experience, and as will be shown in the following sections, increasing model complexity without incorporating precise empirical information results in models that are hard to validate and interpret, rapidly resulting in homogeneous mixing if ensemble averages are performed to compensate for the lack of detailed knowledge, and thus providing very limited extra information when compared to simpler models.",

Argentina has a total population of nearly 45 millions, distributed between 23 federal states (provinces), plus an autonomous city (the city of Buenos Aires, or CABA). Most of the population lives in this city (2.9 millions) plus its suburbs (the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires or AMBA, plus nearby districts, totaling 40 districts with a population over 13 millions). The next most populated regions are the rest of the province of Buenos Aires (PBA), and the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe. The first officially confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was an infected traveler coming from abroad identified on March 3rd. On March 11th, all travellers from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases were requested to stay in isolation for 14 days. Schools and universities were closed on March 16th, and a complete lockdown was enforced on March 19th. Almost immediately afterwards, borders were closed except for flights bringing stranded Argentinians back from abroad, and vice-versa for foreigners. As a result of these measures, the number of infectious travelers slowly increased until reaching a maximum, and then decreased monotonously with time (see Fig. 1 ). The nationwide lockdown was maintained until April 26th, when provinces with zero or very few cases were allowed to relax lockdown rules. In contrast, densely populated areas (over 500,000 inhabitants) or with a large number of confirmed cases were maintained in strict lockdown for at least two more weeks, with the possibility of further extensions to the lockdown.",

However, since the COVID-19 epidemic started with travelers coming from other countries, modeling the increase of infected individuals solely as an interaction with the compartment of exposed individuals will fail to reproduce the early dynamics of the disease. As discussed next, considering the contribution of these individuals results in more reasonable estimates of the disease transmission rate, which are in better agreement with those obtained in other countries by other methods [2, 9, 10, 18] . We thus briefly summarize how to include incoming infectious individuals in the simplest models, and then adopt the same mechanism when developing more complicated models in the following sections.",

It is for this reason that in this example there is an epidemic peak. Suppression can indeed be achieved, but only if the average of the modulation leads to R < 1. In the case of Argentina, which implemented a long lockdown at an early stage of the epidemic, R(t) reached a value of \u2248 0.9 as the most optimisic estimate (other countries reported similar values, see, e.g., [26, 18] ). It is therefore very difficult (or simply unrealistic) to implement an alternating policy that translates into average parameters leading to suppression.

Typically, an epidemic outbreak starts with few infectious cases that are spatially scattered. If the mobility of those cases is small, the epidemic will first develop in scattered foci and then slowly spread until all the interconnected susceptible subjects interact with the infectious population, reaching what is known as the homogeneous situation, described, e.g., by the system of Eqs. (4)- (7) . Typically, the deterministic model used to describe the homogeneous case is therefore thought as the appropriate way to address the evolution of an epidemic outbreak involving a large number of individuals.

The number of infectious individuals quickly drops to zero in some realizations, while in others infectious cases persist for longer times. The mean time for the extinction of the focus can be estimated from such an ensemble. This is also shown in Fig. 4 , which presents this time as a function of the size of the population in the focus.

This indicates the need of factoring individual mobility in the analysis, which will be shown next to correlate with the observed behavior of \u03b2(t). Also, note that the uncertainty of solutions within 95% confidence intervals increases very rapidly, thus forbidding reliable long-term forecasts of the number of cases. This behavior is to be expected in systems with solutions that grow exponentially at early times, and provides a warning message for all attempts at long-term forecasting of the pandemic. same qualitative behavior (but with different values of \u03b2(t)) is observed.

For this purpose, we compared the results against a null model obtained from repeating the above presented simulations across 1000 independent realizations, randomly scrambling the ordering of the regions in the mixing matrix M i, j and in the infection rate vector \u03b2 i . Note that both variables were scrambled only once per simulation, i.e., not once per time step. Finally, we derived a p-value by counting the number of times the goodness of fit (computed as the inverse of the mean squared error [MSE] ) of the model with shuffled M i, j and \u03b2 i was better than the one obtained from the unshuffled data. We conclude that the structure of the empirical mixing matrix plays a significant role in the goodness of fit of our predictions, since the average MSE is higher for the shuffled than for the unshuffled mixing matrix (p < 0.001, and p < 0.05 for 17 of the regions).

We conclude that it is unrealistic to implement certain policies, e.g., alternating between lockdowns and periods of mobility. We also note that without empirical mobility estimates, performing ensemble averages varying unknown parameters over multiple realizations of coupled models results in an evolution compatible with that of homogeneous deterministic models, thus providing very little extra information.",

We showed that mixing and contact matrices estimated from cell phone data could be used to obtain reasonable estimations of the infection rates, both for stochastic and for deterministic models. The predictions of both types of models compared favourably to the official data during the first 60 days of the outbreak. Crucially, this performance depended on the structure of the mixing matrix and not only on its post-lockdown modulation, as shown by the application of permutation tests.",

The spread occurred first to closer districts in the suburbs, and from these districts to other further apart in the region. The models captured this spatio-temporal evolution, including the time of the first cases in each district, and the order of magnitude of the number of cases in a situation where the number of infectious individuals varied significantly from district to district.",

We remind the reader again that simple epidemiological models, even when fed with data stemming from population census and detailed cell phone mobility estimates, are limited in what they can tell us. These limitations arise both from inefficiencies at the core of these models, as well as from shortcomings of the available data. Making these models more complex does not necessarily improve their forecasting capabilities, specially in a situation in which solutions (and small differences) grow, in some cases, exponentially in time. As a result, these models should only be considered as ways of exploring possible solutions of the system, and extreme caution should be exercised whenever these models are used to generate advice in the process of public policy decision making.",
