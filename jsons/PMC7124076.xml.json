In the following formulation of the efficiency model, we temporarily regard the vaccinated state as the state prepared with an intermediate defense measure, making it convenient to compare it with the aforementioned effectiveness model. We describe the epidemic-spreading dynamics using the compartment model whereby individuals in a population can be classified into susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and vaccinated (V) states. A non-vaccinated (more precisely, non-prepared with intermediate defense measures) susceptible individual may become infected if they are exposed to infectious individuals at the disease-transmission rate \u03b2 [per day per person]. An S individual prepared with intermediate defense measures may also become infectious at a rate (1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b2. An infected individual recovers at the recovery rate \u03b3 [per day].",

From Fig. 4.4, the so-called critical-vaccination coverage that eradicates an epidemic spread can be read from the border of the extinct phase at which FES = 0. This border suggests the critical vaccination coverage for suppressing the spread of an infection, which can be determined analytically as x\nc = (1 \u2212 1/R\n0)/(1 \u2212 \u03b5) for the efficiency model and x\nc = (1 \u2212 1/R\n0)/e for the effectiveness model.

It is worth noting that, for smaller values of \u03b7, e appears insensitive to x, implying that e constantly relates to \u03b7 irrespective of x. By contrast, for larger \u03b7 (i.e., \u03b7 > 0.6), the colored contours appear slanted, suggesting that the e\u2013\u03b7 relationship becomes fully dependent on x.

The dynamics of SIR/V on a spatially structured population are not captured by a system of differential equations; thus, we numerically simulate an epidemic spreading on a network using the Gillespie algorithm18 in the extended SIR/V model. For social networks, we can account for any topology in the MAS model. Many interesting toplogies have been discussed; rings (representing 1D regular graphs), lattices (representing 2D regular graphs), random regular networks (RRGs), Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free (BA-SF) networks,21 Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random (E-R random) graphs,22 and small-world (SW) network.23 Figure 4.8 gives some such models. Meanwhile, a couple of network properties have been defined to evaluate its topology and complexity; such as average degree, <k>, degree distribution, P(k), average path length, average cluster coefficient, and assortative coefficient. In rings, lattices, and RRGs, each vertex has the same degree k, i.e., the same number of links, and so these are called homogenous degree-distributed networks. The degree distribution of a scale-free graph obeys a scale-free distribution, and that of the E-R random graph obeys a Poisson distribution. These are classified as heterogeneous degree-distributed networks. A scale-free network has a small number of agents (called \u201chubs\u201d) with a huge number of links, while the vast majority of agents have a small number of links. It is why its degree-distribution is scale-free. And it is the substance of scale-free network. A small-world network can be constructed from a regular graph such as a ring or a lattice. Starting from such a regular graph, severing links with \u201cshort-cut\u201d probabilities (usually presumed to be a small value), and re-connecting them randomly, the graph would become a small-world. One of the most important characteristics is that an SW network has a quite small average path length compared with the original regular graph. Some complex networks observed in real human social systems can feature scale-free and small-world characteristics.\n",

This inevitably results in a pandemic-like situation in Cases 1 (Fig. 4.13b) and 2 (Fig. 4.13c) every other time-step, because the majority of vaccinators form small vaccinator clusters and are less spatially spread-out over the entire domain.\n",

            "text": "One plausible reason why these settings, especially those of Case 4, bring about such acute two-time-step flipping can be formulated as follows. From the inherent nature of its definition, Case 4 sees the non-vaccination strategy as being more advantageous than the vaccination strategy if there are no infected neighbors. Our model framework in not only Case 4 but also in other cases urges infected agents to adopt a vaccination strategy in the next time-step. This implies that agents in Case 4 tend to adopt the defective strategy (non-vaccination) if the outcome of the current time-step is good, whereas they adopt a cooperative strategy (vaccination) if the outcome is bad. This specific feature consequently results in the time flipping that was also observed in Win-Stay and Lose-Shift (WSLS)29 of PD games and is a typical self-reflecting strategy (taking either the same offer to the current one or its opposite), unlike the copying-from-others\u2019 strategy seen in tit-for-tat games. As confirmed above, Cases 3 and 4 contain some fragments of a \u201cself-reflecting strategy.\u201d One recent study30 reports that some strategic adaptations based on the concept of WSLS can enhance cooperation for spatial-PD games. This is because sparsely located cooperative agents showing time-flipping manners with time-alternating defection are able to realize a reasonable amount of mutual reciprocity. This is interesting because the mechanism appears to be very different from the usual network reciprocity as previously understood, in which a situation of compactly clustered cooperators would be more likely to result in efficient network reciprocity. However, in the vaccination game, which has a different game structure than PD games, Cases 3 and 4 somehow contain a \u201cself-reflecting\u201d feature that does not result in any preferable consequences.",

It is worthwhile to note that TSP is independent of the size of a subsidy. This is quite natural, because governmental expenditure should be consistent with revenue as a whole. Eq. (4.27) revels that the subsidy works, in a sense, as a social \u201ccatalyst\u201d, allowing us to evaluate how much a subsidy (of a certain amount based on a certain policy) is able to enhance the number of voluntary vaccinators (or vaccinators in general). Thus, TSP can be thought of as an appropriate index for evaluating the social efficiency of a subsidy policy in the present study. We do not consider the additional cost burden levied on each individual, TAX, when evaluating each individual\u2019s payoff, because, in the real world, we cannot recognize exactly how much tax each individual has paid specifically for subsidies, as tax is generally levied. Thus, the breakdown of expenditure is not visible to us. However, a subsidy given as a free ticket or a discounting coupon is, of course, manifestly visible to the subsidized individual. This is why such a subsidy policy is generally favored and enthusiastically accepted by typical people in the street, on which the politics of \u201cpopulism\u201d tends to ride.",

Another takes place when a larger vaccination cost and subsidy budget are presumed. The former accords with regions of negative-VC difference (Fig. 4.19a) and positive-FES difference (Fig. 4.19b); in this region, subsidies going to defective individuals who have no intention of vaccinating eventually reduce the number of voluntary vaccinators (e.g., self-financed vaccinators), leading to a wider spread of disease and pushing up the total social cost due to a larger number of infectious individuals. This is quite ironic from the viewpoint of social context. The implication drawn from this particular case is that too small of a budget for the subsidy policy in the case of a relatively smaller vaccination cost fails to increase the number of voluntary vaccinators, but rather causes individuals to refrain from cooperating in establishing a herd immunity. Unlike the first negative region with a smaller budget, the second negative region with too much of a subsidy in the case of a relatively larger vaccination cost (Fig. 4.27c) successfully realizes a larger VC (Fig. 4.19a) and smaller FES (Fig. 4.19b) vis-\u00e0-vis the default case. This fact proves that overspending on the financial support brings too much vaccinators including forcefully committing individuals. It is obviously over the socially approved level whereat the cost of infection of society as a whole is balanced by the cost of vaccination including a subsidy policy (which may be the social optimum). Therefore, to ensure an optimal subsidy-policy design to pre-empt vaccination, an appropriate level (neither too large nor too small) of subsidy expenditure is quite important.

The comparison between Fig. 4.19 and Fig. 4.24 confirms that the effect of random links results in a quite large difference from the case of a regular & homogeneous network (lattice; Fig. 4.19). The existence of random links devastates the efficiency of subsidy policy, resulting from the significantly wider negative regions compared with those observed in Fig. 4.19. In particular, the first negative region with a smaller budget spreads to much larger C\nr as well as larger \u03c3. Moreover, comparing RRG (Fig. 4.24) with BA-SF (Fig. 4.25), we should note that the latter shows worse performance than the former. Thus, not only the existence of random links but also the non-uniform degree distribution undermines to the subsidy system. As is commonly recognized, human social networks can feature scale-free degree distributions, unlike small-world characteristics.42 Recalling this fact, we should note the important result observed in Fig. 4.25c that the subsidy works inversely to reduce the total social cost when almost any vaccination-cost range (C\nr < 0.9) and feasibly realistic budget size (\u03c3 < 0.5) are presumed, which may be meaningful from the standpoint of social applications.\n\n",

Focusing on TSP under Models A-1 and A-2, the negative region exists in a relatively smaller subsidy size of \u03c3(hereafter, the first negative region) and a larger subsidy size of \u03c3, dovetailed with a higher vaccination cost (hereafter, second negative region). In the first negative region, a subsidy going to non-vaccinators (i.e., defectors) counterproductively works to suppress the social cost because being a defector becomes cost-advantageous (since they may avoid infection by being given free-tickets), reducing the fraction of cooperators (i.e., vaccinators) as compared with the default case. As a consequence, the number of self-financed vaccinators comes down, worsening the social efficiency. On the other hand, in the second negative region, due to a relatively higher vaccination cost compared to disease cost, some reasonable number of people getting infected is rather beneficial to the entire society, rather than spending too much on vaccination. Furthermore, although the general tendencies of Models A-1 and A-2 are the same, more deliberate comparison reveals that Model A-2 more badly works so that makes the first negative region more red than Model A-1 does. Namely, Model A-2 delivers all free-tickets to non-vaccinators, which consequently reduces self-financed vaccinators more significantly than does Model A-1. Therefore, one important social implication that can be noted is that a subsidy helping people who potentially aim to free-ride on the public good devastates social efficiently. A subsidy system should be based on the principle that \u201cheaven helps those who help themselves\u201d. As we confirm latter in the discussion on Models A-3 and B, a subsidy system focused only on potential vaccinators more efficiently suppresses the total social cost vis-a-vis the default case.",

As a whole, those two subsidy models outperform other models (Models A-1 and A-2). Hence, we would say that a subsidy policy focused only on potential vaccinators should be adopted.

Pairs of the broken-line boxes in Models A-3 and B prove this, where the region in Model A-3 looks bluer than that by Model B. One plausible cause for this tendency is that distributing free tickets only to limited eligible individuals drives people to vaccinate (increasing self-financed vaccinators) more significantly than offering a discount coupon to all eligible individuals, due to the non-linearity of the Fermi function considered when updating a strategy. This can explained in detail below.",

Note that the state-transition probability of Model A-3 is larger than that of Model B, which is attributed to the reduction in price by a free-ticket or discount-coupon. Since the same \u03c3 is presumed for this comparison, the fraction (number) of vaccinators given free-tickets in Model A-3 is less than that given discount-coupons (that is consistent with the entire number of vaccinators) in Model B, which is considered in the final dynamical equations (Eq.

Let us compare our respective TSPs with e = 0.4. The black and gray boxes indicate the first and second negative regions. As discussed above, the first negative region results from the situation whereby subsidizing non-vaccinators hampers the increase of self-financed vaccinators, while the second region is brought about by the fact that spending too much on vaccination becomes less beneficial on the whole than allowing a reasonable level of infectious individuals. Although the first negative regions (black boxes) are at comparable levels, the second negative region (gray box) of Fig. 4.32 is less than that of Fig. 4.30, only appearing at larger \u03c3and larger C\nr. Thus, sharing global information during strategy-updating events (SB-RA) helps to justify a subsidy system. Observing carefully, we can note that the range of vaccination costs justifying subsidies (colored blue) is insensitive to \u03c3; however, although it clearly appears around 0.2 \u2264 C\nr \u2264 0.5 in Fig. 4.30, it almost disappears in Fig. 4.32. If we make the same comparison for Model A-2 in Figs. 4.30 and 4.32 (see black and gray boxes in respective right panels), we find the same behavior. There is none of any range of vaccination cost justifying subsidy insensitive to \u03c3 in Model A-2 of Figs. 4.31 and 4.32. Moreover, remarkably, in the right-hand panel of Model A-2 in Fig. 4.32, there is almost no parameter region in which a subsidy is justified. Subsidizing only non-vaccinators (Model A-2) in the case presuming a strategy-updating rule relying on global information (SB-RA) and a unreliable vaccination (e = 0.4) is not justified at all.",

Overspending on a subsidy when the vaccination cost is high brings the situation that rather some people being infected becomes rather socially efficient than too much vaccinators due to the relation of vaccination cost to infection cost; this devastates the social efficiency compared to the default case realizing (which we hereafter call the \u201csecond regime\u201d).",
