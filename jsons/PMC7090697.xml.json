            "text": "Rabies virus (RABV) is a prototypical neurotropic virus causing acute, fatal encephalitis in humans and other animals worldwide. Although rabies can be prevented by appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration, more than 59,000 people die of this incurable disease annually in the world (Brunker and Mollentze 2018), emerging the significant demand to further investigate the mechanism of RABV life cycle and develop efficient therapeutics. RABV has a non-segmented, single stranded negative RNA genome of about 12 kb, encoding five viral proteins including nucleoprotein (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and glycoprotein (G) (Davis et al.2015). To facilitate the efficient infection and replication, RABV has developed multiple strategies including interaction with host proteins to gain essential functions in viral replicative cycle. An example is that the heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) was shown to interact with the N protein of RABV and to be present in both the nucleocapsid and purified virions, while down regulation of HSP70, using an inhibitor or RNA interference, results in a significant decrease in the production of viral mRNAs, viral proteins, and virions (Lahaye  et al.2012). However, the knowledge on the host protein assembled into RABV virions is limited.",

For example, retroviruses, rhabdoviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and paramyxoviruses bud via host endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery (Chen and Lamb 2008; Votteler and Sundquist 2013). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the best understood viruses in this respect. ESCRT subunits are recruited at HIV assembly sites and have been detected in the released HIV particles by three dimensional super resolution microscopy (Van Engelenburg  et al.2014). ESCRT machinery were also found to be associated with RABV life cycle (Okumura and Harty 2011), but what kind of ESCRT subunits participate in RABV budding has been not investigated.",

            "text": "Sensitive mass spectrometry enables the identification of host proteins incorporated into virions with high accuracy and sensitivity. So far, proteomic studies have been performed on a number of purified virus preparations, including DNA viruses (Stegen  et al.2013; Alejo  et al.2018) and a broad range of RNA viruses (Shaw  et al.2008; Radhakrishnan  et al.2010; Nuss  et al.2014; Lussignol  et al.2016; McKnight  et al.2017; Ziegler  et al.2018), as well as virus-like particles (Vera-Velasco  et al.2018). These studies have revealed substantial host proteins incorporated into viral particles, with several highlighting the utility of proteomics in understanding the mechanisms of virus-host interaction and identification of the essential role of cellular proteins in viral assembly or morphogenesis. For an instance, the proteomic analysis of hepatitis C virions (HCV) has identified the participation of host proteins in viral infection and revealed the interaction of HCV capsid protein with nucleoporin Nup98, a host protein important for viral propagation and morphogenesis (Lussignol  et al.2016). Proteomic analysis has also shown the engagement of host proteins in the assembly of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with one, heat shock protein 90, playing an important role in the assembly and maturation of the virus particles (Radhakrishnan  et al.2010). However, until the present work, the host protein constituents of rabies virions had remained largely unknown, although their identification could significantly enhance our understanding of the pathways of viral budding and entry, and the mechanisms of virus-host interactions required for RABV propagation.",

Observation by TEM showed that most particles are in well-defined bullet-shaped with a length of 120\u2013180 nm in the F3 band (20%\u201325% iodixanol).

Following further sedimentation through a 15%\u201325% iodixanol density gradient, the purity and integrity of the virions of three independent purifications were checked by electron microscopy prior to the following proteomic analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the purified virus particles were free of cellular debris or vesicles with most having intact, typical bullet shapes of length 120\u2013180 nm. Small numbers of ruptured and DI particles were observed (Fig. 1B). Higher magnification highlighted the characteristic bullet-shaped morphology covered by numerous spikes (Fig. 1C). The purity of the virion preparations was estimated by counting the proportion of virus particles among total particles in images of the three sets of purifications.

According to the Uniprot Knowledge database, many of the proteins were localized at the cell membrane, cytoplasm and actin cytoskeleton. It is worth noting that more than half of these host proteins (34/49) were also found in the other viruses within 11 viral families (Table 1). Of them, CD9, CD81, cofilin-1, cyclophilin A, GAPDH, enolase, HSC70, HSP90\u03b2 and RAB5C were the most frequently identified in the virions of different viruses, indicating that they were widely recruited by these viruses to benefit their replicative cycles (Table 1). For example, the presence of cyclophilin A in the virions aids capsid stabilization in both influenza virus and HIV by interacting with capsid protein in the early stage of the viral replication (Liu et al.2009, 2016). As reviewed in a recent publication, heat shock protein 90 is a crucial host factor required by many viruses for multiple phases of their life cycle (Wang  et al.2017).

Absence of the viral glycoprotein and the presence of the viral nucleoprotein (N) and matrix protein (M) verified that the ProK digestion was 100% efficient (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HSC70, cofilin, CHMP4B, HSP40, ALIX, TSG101, CHMP2A, VPS37 and VPS4B were all present in the ProK-treated virions, indicating their locations within the virion (Fig. 3A). Extracts from uninfected and infected N2a cells were included as controls to confirm the reactivity of the antibodies and size of the proteins. CD9, however, was completely absent from ProK-treated virions while \u03b2-actin was reduced by about 50%, indicating that CD9 was present only on the virion surface, while \u03b2-actin was located both inside and outside (Fig. 3A). Immunogold labeling further confirmed the incorporation of these host proteins into the virion surface. As shown in Fig. 3B, gold particle labelling identified CD9 and \u03b2-actin as well as the viral G protein on the surface of virus particles. Although it was unrealistic to validate all 49 cellular proteins, confirmation of the incorporation of all 11 proteins demonstrated the high probability of incorporation of all 49 proteins into rabies virions.

To better understand the biological significance of the host proteins ending up in mature rabies virions, functional predictions of the 49 virion-packaged cellular proteins were performed according to the Gene Ontology Database. Results showed that they are grouped into 12 functional categories, including viral transport, protein localization, cytoskeleton organization, and transcription (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S1). Some proteins had multiple functions, and therefore were classified into multiple categories. Worth noting is that 24 of the 49 proteins were associated with viral processes such as entry (Galectin-1, CD9, CD81, CD151, CD63, IFITM2), genome replication (PCBP1, HSC70, ARF3, CyPA, DDX3X, ENO1, IFITM2, Rack1), assembly (HSP90\u03b2), budding (ALIX, CHMP4B, CHMP2A, VPS4B, TSG101, VPS37B, VPS28), release (Rab-7A, cofilin-1) and spread (PACSIN2) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S1).",

Although the number of host proteins identified in two studies was almost the same, their proteomic compositions were distinct. To understand the proteomic composition of pathogenic RABV virions infecting nervous cells the present study was conducted, resulting in identification of 49 cellular proteins incorporated into CVS-11 with 11 of them validated by Western blotting or immuno-electron microscopy. Of 49 cellular proteins identified in CVS-11 virions purified from infected N2a cells only 13 were identified in SRV9 virions purified from infected BHK-21 cells, which mainly included 4 cytoskeleton-related proteins (Cofilin-1,GAPDH, Tubulin \u03b2-5, \u03b2-actin) and 4 virus replication associated proteins (HSC70, ARF3, CyPA, ENO1). The rest 36 proteins were not identified in SRV9 virions. It is interesting to note that ESCRT proteins associated with viral budding identified on CVS-11 virions were not found on SRV9 virions. This suggests that pathogenic and avirulent vaccine RABVs likely incorporate distinct cellular proteins into their virions during budding and release from host cells.",

            "text": "Among the identified cellular proteins in CVS-11 virions, HSC70 and cofilin-1 had previously been reported to be involved in RABV infection. HSC70 protein was reported to interact with RABV leader RNA (leRNA), with its expression level dynamically regulated by RABV infection: down-regulated at an early stage with gradual up-regulation (Zhang  et al.2017). Here we demonstrate that HSC70 was packaged inside the virions. Cofilin is known to play an essential role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and while its knockdown did not affect the expression of RABV proteins, virion release was inhibited (Zan  et al.2016). RABV infection has been reported to up-regulate the expression of phosphorylated cofilin to facilitate actin polymerization for virus budding (Zan  et al.2016). Here, we also identified the phosphorylation of cofilin in RABV-infected cells but the protein found on virions was not phosphorylated (data not shown), indicating that cofilin was likely de-phosphorylated when packed into the rabies virion during budding. In addition, PCBP1 was also identified as being incorporated into the rabies virion. PCBP1, an RNA-binding protein, has been reported to interact with the ORF57 gene of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), being involved in regulation of the expression of both cellular and viral genes through the activated internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Nishimura  et al.2004), however, its function in RABV infection remains unknown. A previous study showed that its highly conserved isoform, PCBP2 (90% aa identity with PCBP1), increased the stability of RABV glycoprotein mRNA through selective interaction with its 3\u2032 UTR (Palusa  et al.2012). This suggests that PCBP1 incorporated into virions might act as a functional partner for gene expression and posttranscriptional regulation.",

            "text": "Many enveloped viruses utilize the host ESCRT for budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells (Votteler and Sundquist 2013). In this process viruses employ the ESCRT machinery by selectively using core consensus sequences PPxY, PS/TAP, YxxL and FPIV (in which x denotes any amino acid), of the virus-encoded late domain (L-domain), which results in recruitment of the proteins in ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III and VPS4 for viral budding and release (Chen and Lamb 2008). In rabies virus, the M protein contains two L-domains, PPEY and YVPL, which are found in an overlapping fashion (35PPEYVPL41) near its N terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis has confirmed that the PPEY motif is essential for efficient release of rabies virions (Wirblich  et al.2008), but the cellular factors required for viral budding have yet to be determined. The PPPY motif has been reported to recruit TSG101 for the budding of Marburg VP40-induced virus-like particles its incorporation within (Urata  et al.2007). Likewise, our study has provided evidence for the incorporation of TSG101 into the rabies virion during budding (Fig. 3A), presumably mediated via its binding to the PPEY motif of the M protein. In addition to TSG101, other downstream ESCRT members, VPS28 and VPS37 in ESCRT-I, CHMP2A and CHMP4B in ESCRT-III, and also VPS4B, have been found to be recruited into rabies virions (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1). Elsewhere, ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2A, CHMP4B and VPS4 have been reported associated with the budding of HIV, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), and murine leukemia virus (Morita  et al.2011; Sandrin and Sundquist 2013; Bartusch and Prange 2016). It is likely from our results, therefore, that these ESCRT proteins are also important for the effective budding and release of RABV. Another L-domain, YxxL, is present as YVPL in RABV M protein, but its function is unknown; however, EIAV uses this motif (as YPDL) within the late assembly domain of the Gag p9 protein to recruit cellular protein ALIX (another rabies virion component) for its budding (Chen  et al.2005). Furthermore, ALIX binding to CHMP4 can recruit downstream ESCRT-III subunits (e.g., CHMP2A) and form the CHMP complex by polymerization, compressing the neck of budding viruses to facilitate fission and membrane scission (McCullough  et al.2008; Johnson  et al.2018). In addition, it is known that the AAA-type ATPase VPS4 A/B recruited by ESCRT-III is essential for disassembly of ESCRT-III spirals and is also likely to provide energy (Adell  et al.2014). Here, VPS4B was identified in the RABV virion (Fig. 3A) and its function merits further investigation.",

Since cryo-EM has shown that M protein forms a helical layer it appears that viral morphogenesis takes place in specialized cytoplasmic areas. The genome-containing nucleocapsid (NC) is enfolded within a layer of M helix, which is transported to the plasma membrane (PM) containing the viral G protein, causing extrusion of the membrane to form the bullet-shaped budding site (Schnell  et al.1998; Johnson  et al.2018). Recruitment of ESCRT at the assembly sites is likely mediated by M protein by two pathways: (1) the PPEY motif recruiting TSG101, VPS28, VPS37 (ESCRT\u00adI); and (2) the YVPL motif recruiting ALIX. Downstream CHMP2A and CHMP4B (ESCRT-III) would then be recruited to form the budding neck by polymerization of the ESCRT-III proteins (Shen  et al.2014). Since VPS4 can mediate disassembly/remodeling of CHMP2A (Van Engelenburg  et al.2014), it may be that VPS4B can remodel CHMP2A and CHMP4B into a filamentous structure to drive membrane scission, ultimately resulting in the release of the mature RABV particles into a new round of infection.",
