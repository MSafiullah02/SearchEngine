            "text": "Infectious canine respiratory diseases primarily occur in dogs housed in groups, including those in rescue shelters, breeding kennels, and veterinary hospitals. Several studies evaluating natural disease outbreaks have demonstrated complex etiologies and infection with various viruses and bacteria. Common infectious causes of respiratory disease in dogs include canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV\u20102).\n1\n A canine coronavirus associated with clinical canine respiratory disease similar to bovine coronavirus has been recently described in the UK.\n2\n However, CAV\u20102 is more commonly associated with infectious laryngotracheitis, or the kennel cough complex. The CAV\u20102 virus is included in the genus Mastadenovirus and the family Adenoviridae. Adenoviridae are non\u2010enveloped icosahedral viruses with 26\u2010 to 44\u2010kb double\u2010stranded DNA genomes,\n3\n and infect a variety of vertebrates including mammals, fish, birds, and reptiles.\n3\n Pulmonary CAV\u20102 lesions are consistent with those of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, including the presence of necrosis and large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (IN/IBs) in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells as well as pulmonary macrophages.\n4\n Simultaneous CAV\u20102 and CDV infections have been previously described.\n5\n Histopathology is a reliable indicator of CAV\u20102 infection because large IN/IBs are easily visualized in the infected lung. However, it is frequently difficult to find IN/IBs in lung tissue, (particularly in autolyzed tissue), at the early and late stages of infection, and in cases co\u2010infected with suppurative bacteria.",
