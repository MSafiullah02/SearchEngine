Diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [4]. Various specimens including respiratory samples from throat swab or sputum, urine, blood or stool samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 following WHO guidelines for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [5,6]. Positive results of COVID-19 infection were defined as any positive test from the above specimens. Routine serial hematologic and biochemical tests were performed after admission, and the serum samples were screened for common respiratory pathogens, including antibodies to adenovirus, chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie virus A16, legionella pneumophila and mycobacterium tuberculosis and all were negative. Chest X-Ray and chest CT scans were obtained for all patients and monitored serially.",

In addition to the above cytokines, the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 are often significant contributors to the host response to infections and increased morbidity and mortality [22]. IL-6 is an example of a multifunctional cytokine involved in the mediation of the immune response and inflammation [23,24]. IL-6 is produced mainly by monocytes, but also be produced by interstitial fibroblasts, alveolar macrophages in the lung [25,26]. IL-6 has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury [27]. Histological characteristics in the lung of COVID-19 patients showed diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial lymphocytes infiltrates [11]. IL-6 may act as a functional mediator to recruit lymphocytes into the lung lesions, which can further secrete IL-6 in a vicious cycle, thus aggravating the lung injury and hastening death.",
