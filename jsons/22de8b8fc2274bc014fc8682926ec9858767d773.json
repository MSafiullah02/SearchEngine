In an effort to prevent hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections, most hospitals have severely curtailed elective surgery, performing only surgeries if the patient's survival or permanent function would be compromised by a delay in surgery. As hospitals emerge from the pandemic, it will be necessary to progressively increase surgical activity at a time when hospitals continue to care for Covid-19 patients. In an attempt to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection, we have created a patient care pathway designed to minimize risk of exposure of patients coming in to the hospital for scheduled procedures. The \"Covid-minimal surgery pathway\" is a predetermined patient flow, that dictates the locations, personnel and materials that come in contact with our cancer surgery population, designed to minimize risk for virus transmission. We outline the approach that allowed a large academic medical center to create a Covid-minimal cancer surgery pathway within 7 days of initiating discussions.",

To this end, elective surgeries have largely been cancelled at hospitals in countries and regions affected by the pandemic in order to preserve resources needed to care for patients with Covid-19 and to minimize patient exposure. However, many hospitals continue to perform surgeries in patients whose survival or permanent function could be compromised by delaying surgery (i.e. \"urgent operations\"). Included among these urgent surgical procedures, are a range of procedures for cancer treatment. Many patients requiring cancer operations are elderly and have medical problems, making a Covid-19 infection potentially more dangerous 1, 2 .

When patients with cancer do become infected by Covid-19, they are at higher risk than the general population for adverse effects, such as ICU admission, intubation, and death 6 . While it is unlikely hospitals can completely eliminate the potential for viral transmission from infected patients, there are several approaches capable of mitigating risk (e.g. wearing of masks, hand washing, distancing, etc).

More commonly, there may be opportunities to commit specific units, or portions of units to be designated for the pathway in which cancer surgery patients are spaced apart from Covid patients. For example, specific operating rooms could be designated for the exclusive use by pathway patients. In addition to be not allowing Covid-19, suspected Covid, or Covid unknown patients to have surgery in these rooms, ideally, the covid-minimal pathway rooms would be geographically separated from those dedicated to the care of Covid-19 patients. In this way not only are personnel and equipment less likely to cross between rooms, but during transportation it would less likely the pathway patient would pass through potentially infected spaces.
