The plasma utilized for production of SDPP is collected at veterinary-inspected abattoirs from animals designated as fit for human consumption. Specifically, blood is collected into containers with anticoagulant and the erythrocytes are removed by centrifugation. The plasma obtained is subsequently spray-dried and used for the production of food, feed and for industrial applications. It has been shown that specific spray-drying conditions substantially reduce the number of viable microorganisms (Ananta et al., 2005, Polo et al., 2005, Pujols et al., 2007). The blood is pooled from 6000 to 10,000 animals slaughtered on the same day, resulting in a mixture of antibodies against various pathogens that have a neutralizing effect on potential pathogens present in the plasma and can be considered as an effective biosafety step in the manufacturing process of SDPP (Polo et al., 2013).",

PEDV causes an acute, highly contagious diarrhea in pigs of all ages with up to 90\u201395% mortality in suckling pigs in na\u00efve breeding herds (Stevenson et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2012, Temeeyasen et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). Outbreaks of PEDV have occurred in all pig producing areas in Europe (Song and Park, 2012) followed by introduction into Asia in the early 1990s (Kusanagi et al., 1992). More recently, PEDV was introduced to North America and rapidly spread across farms and states causing large-scale outbreaks with high rates of morbidity and mortality (Huang et al., 2013, Mole, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013). Thus far, there is no effective vaccine or specific treatment available, and the only measures to control the disease are those directed at preventing the introduction of the virus to farms (Park et al., 2011, Song and Park, 2012, Temeeyasen et al., 2013).",

Recently, SDPP products were implicated to transmit PEDV in the USA and Canada (Anonymous, 2014). Analytical results released by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food indicated the presence of PEDV RNA in commercial SDPP; bioassay tests confirmed infectious PEDV in the SDPP but not in the associated feed in which it was used as an ingredient (Pasick et al., 2014).",

After a washing step, a 1:20,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The peroxidase reaction was visualized by using tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution as the substrate for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2.5 M sulfuric acid to each well.

Other enveloped viruses with similar heat resistance such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and pseudorabies virus, and even more stable non-enveloped RNA viruses such as swine vesicular disease virus (Turner and Williams, 1999) have been successfully inactivated by spray-drying (Polo et al., 2005, Pujols et al., 2007). In contrast, porcine circovirus type 2, a non-enveloped DNA virus, is considered a model for heat resistant viruses (Martin et al., 2008, O\u2019Dea et al., 2008) and the spray drying process using laboratory spray dryer models is not fully capable of inactivation (Patterson et al., 2010).",

To make sure that an appropriate positive control was utilized, plasma was spiked with a known amount of infectious PEDV. In addition, the plasma was free of PEDV antibodies to avoid potential virus neutralization prior to spray drying. When administered directly in untreated liquid form, as expected, infectious PEDV-spiked into plasma retained its infectivity and was capable of infecting the PEDV na\u00efve pigs in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group as determined by viral shedding in feces and seroconversion to PEDV. To further test if PEDV is capable of surviving the spray-drying process, plasma containing infectious PEDV (SD-PEDV-CONTROL) was spray-dried using a laboratory bench spray-dryer. Although PEDV RNA could be detected in the plasma powder after spray drying, none of the SD-PEDV-CONTROL pigs became PEDV infected, as evidenced by the lack of PEDV RNA in feces and no evidence of seroconversion.",

Therefore, the storage conditions used in the present study were not detrimental to the virus viability indicating that the viral inactivation in the present study was due to the spray-drying process itself. It is worth noting that the concentration of PEDV in the plasma that was spray-dried and used for the SD-PEDV-CONTROL group was higher than the concentration in the liquid plasma used in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group. Together with the data obtained in the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group, this indicates that the spray drying process inactivated the virus.",

Therefore, it has been suggested that it may not be appropriate to fully extrapolate data obtained through use of the bench-top laboratory spray dryer to the commercial spray drying processes (Thybo et al., 2008). In general, laboratory spray dryers have less capability of viral inactivation compared with commercial spray-driers (Shen et al., 2011). Therefore the results from the present study are encouraging as they indicate complete inactivation of infectious PEDV even under less stringent conditions supporting an overall low risk that infectious PEDV, if present, may survive the commercial spray-drying process. In the present study, the outlet temperature used was the same as suggested for spray-dried plasma production under commercial processes, as this parameter has been shown to have the single major effect on microorganism viability (Ananta et al., 2005). Usage of different spray-drying conditions or lapses in the consistency of the processes could potentially lead to an incomplete viral inactivation and further work needs to be done to understand and perhaps improve the quality assurance of the processes utilized by the SDPP industry. Alternatively, contamination of PEDV in SDPP and by-products may occur post-processing as suggested by recovery of infectious PEDV from feed without inclusion of animal by-products (Dee et al., 2014). Additionally, PEDV has been demonstrated to become aerosolized and transported up to 10 miles from infected sites (Alonso et al., 2014) thereby showing a great potential for wide spread and environmental contamination.",

            "text": "Although it was initially thought that enteric coronaviruses including PEDV are not associated with viremia (Saif and Heckert, 1990), viral loads of 4.0\u20137.6 log10 PEDV genome equivalent copy numbers per ml of serum have been described recently in experimentally and naturally PEDV-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014). In contrast, the outcomes of another study using an experimental PEDV model in young pigs suggest that detection of PEDV RNA in blood occurs sporadically and at low levels (Opriessnig et al., 2014). Similarly, no PEDV RNA could be detected in serum samples of the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL pigs in the present study. Differences in the ability of the PEDV to reach the vascular system may be associated with the viral strain (Park and Shin, 2014). Sporadic detection of viral RNA of another enteric coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), in blood seems to be associated with mononuclear cells that engulf the virus in the gut and subsequently gain access to the vascular system (Vogel et al., 2010). The susceptibility of mononuclear cells to FECV is however poor and viral spread is inefficient (Rottier et al., 2005). Rather than direct PEDV viremia, secondary contamination of blood and blood products with PEDV RNA at the slaughterhouse level, for example with fecal material, seems to be a more likely source for the observed PEDV contaminations of pooled plasma samples. This should be further investigated to improve the overall production and manufacturing processes.",

Transient detection of PEDV RNA in serum samples could be partially explained by association of PEDV with macrophages in acutely infected pigs. In the present study, there was no evidence of active PEDV infection when plasma obtained from previously PEDV infected pigs was given to the RAW-SICK group. Plasma PEDV RNA level in the pooled samples utilized for the present study was below real-time RT-PCR detection limit. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the extent and significance of PEDV RNA detection in serum of infected animals and whether the virus in the blood stream retains infectivity.",
