Sharing information with one's social network has become the fundamental and constitutive activity on social media (John, 2012), which makes social media a desirable space for spreading information. The value of social media in information diffusion lies not only in its ability to broadcast information to a large number of people but also in its support for social networks through which information can travel and reach more people who are otherwise not exposed to the information. Information diffused the most can signal the importance of the information at a particular time and quickly focus the public's attention on the issue (Nahon & Hemsley, 2013). In the context of health communication, health organizations have turned to social media to diffuse health education and prevention information (Harris, Mueller, & Snider, 2013). Identifying factors that drive the diffusion of health information is critical for scholars to understand how health information may or may not spread in a similar way as other viral content on social media, as well as for practitioners to design spreadable health messages that need the public's attention and action.",

However, classic diffusion research acknowledges the importance of interpersonal networks in the process of information diffusion (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), which has been supported by information science scholars (Bakshy et al., 2012, Watts and Dodds, 2007). Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory argues that diffusion is determined by not only attributes of an innovation (e.g., novelty and relative advantage) but also properties of communication networks (e.g., opinion leaders and weak ties) within which the innovation spreads (Rogers, 2003). On social media such as Twitter, health information could present different message features and be passed along by users with different network positions or roles in the communication network (Figueiredo, Chen, & Azevedo, 2015). Therefore, in order to have a complete understanding of information sharing in the social media environment, this study examines the effects of both message and network features on diffusion of health-related information.",

Diffusion size is the aggregated number of adoptions of an innovation over time (Rogers, 2003), while diffusion structure characterizes patterns of diffusion of an innovation (Goel, Anderson, Hofman, & Watts, 2016). Diffusion structure is an important dimension for understanding a cascade on a continuum with broadcast and viral spreading as the two extreme patterns (Goel et al., 2016). The examination of structural virality presents an extension of DOI theory beyond the size of diffusion. In this study, the innovations examined are new tweets originally posted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Twitter. Adoption of the innovation is retweeting behavior of an individual user. This study aims to investigate message and network features that affect the size and structure of diffusion of health information tweeted by CDC.",

            "text": "Diffusion studies built on DOI theory typically focus on the aggregated number of adoptions (i.e., size) as a diffusion outcome (Valente, 1995). Relatively little attention has been paid to explain structural patterns of diffusion. The accumulative number of adoptions may arise from two distinct structural mechanisms: broadcast and viral diffusion (Goel et al., 2016). This idea of broadcast versus viral spreading is not new. Back to Roger's theoretical discussion on communication channels for diffusion and the classic two-step flow model (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), broadcast via mass media and virality via interpersonal connections are the two primary routes for information to diffuse in a community. Structural virality formally conceptualizes structural patterns of diffusion by quantifying the distinction between broadcast and viral diffusion (Goel et al., 2016). Broadcast diffusion depicts a pattern where a large number of adoptions grow from a single parent node, whereas viral diffusion depicts a pattern where multiple generations contribute to the diffusion process and any one node infects only a few others (Goel et al., 2016). Diffusions with the same size may present structural diversity characterized by both broadcast and viral mechanisms (Fig. 1\n), as well as conceivable combinations of the two. An analysis with 1 billion unique tweets showed that a higher correlation between size and structural virality was only 0.2 (Goel et al., 2016). Therefore, an examination of structural virality contributes to our theoretical and empirical understanding of fine-grained structures of diffusion as an outcome variable beyond the aggregated size of diffusion. Fig. 1 presents a visual example with different patterns of diffusion.",

            "text": "DOI theory claims that perceived attributes of an innovation are an important explanation of diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2003). Following this logic, perceived message features could determine the extent to which individuals share the messages to their social circles. Unlike expressed message features that focus on literal message variations that are independent of audience perceptions or responses, perceived message features are effect-based in terms of audience responses towards messages (O'Keefe, 2003). Relying on DOI theory, the current study focuses on the effect of perceived, rather than expressed, message features on diffusing health-related tweets. Research has shown that perceived information utility of a message is positively associated with individuals' sharing behavior (Kim, 2015). However, it is not clear what message features constitute perceived information utility. Information utility model (Knobloch, Carpentier, & Zillmann, 2003) helps to unpack this audience perception. The model claims that the susceptibility and the severity of experiencing negative events suggested in a message indicate its information utility. For example, a tweet message \u201cThe rate of new cases of melanoma is expected to double by 2025\u201d may make people perceive highly susceptible to melanoma; a tweet message \u201cMelanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, killing 9000 people each year\u201d may make people perceive high severity of having melanoma. Individuals need to monitor their environment to be able to adapt and to survive, and therefore, information that make people perceive threats is considered to be more useful. On social media, impression management and self-presentation shape people's communication behavior (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). Passing on useful information enhances an individual's image as being well informed, smart and helpful (Berger, 2014). Communicating that desired image motivates individuals to spread information of high utility to their social contacts.",

Research has shown that people have concerns for others in their social networks and want to help save others from negative experience (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, & Gremler, 2004). Passing on information is a way of exerting interpersonal influence. In persuasion literature, the extended parallel process model (Witte, 1992) argues that messages that produce high levels of perceived susceptibility and severity of experiencing a negative event is more persuasive than messages characterized as low in perceived susceptibility and severity. The above arguments from two different theoretical perspectives both indicate that tweet messages of high information utility and of high persuasiveness (i.e., information conveying susceptibility and severity) should be more likely to be retransmitted.Hypothesis 1 (H1)Health-related tweets that make individuals perceive higher (a) susceptibility and (b) severity of experiencing negative health conditions have a larger size of diffusion.\n",

Efficacy typically includes response efficacy and self-efficacy. Response efficacy refers to the effectiveness of the recommended response in deterring health risks (Witte et al., 1996). Self-efficacy refers to one's capability of performing the recommended response (Witte et al., 1996). Response efficacy information may address benefits of performing a recommended solution, while self-efficacy information may explain simple steps about how to carry out the recommended solution to minimize health risks. For example, a tweet message \u201c2 doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective\u201d may make people perceive high response efficacy of MMR vaccine; a tweet message \u201cYou can protect yourself from Hepatitis A when travelling with a simple #vaccine \u2026\u201d may make people perceive high self-efficacy to take the vaccine. Past studies have shown that messages with high-level of efficacy information were rated as more useful (Knobloch-Westerwick & Sarge, 2015). News stories that increased efficacious perceptions were retransmitted more times via emails (Kim, 2015).

Others found that health-related tweets with positive or negative affective tone were more likely to be propagated than the ones with neutral affective tone (McLaughlin et al., 2016), and that spikes of tweet volume about an event were associated with increased negative sentiment contained in tweets (Thelwall et al., 2011).

People in general like to be around positive persons, and thus, sharing positive emotions helps build social bonding (Berger, 2014). On the other hand, sharing negative emotion is beneficial in that it improves one's mood, such as reducing anxiety or feeling of dissonance (Berger, 2014). People may feel better and receive social support after expressing negative emotion (Grandey, 2000). Communicating negative emotion can also be construed as showing out of the ordinary or cynical sophistication (Cappella, Kim, & Albarracin, 2015).

People are inclined to monitor information sent by opinion leaders as well as emulate their behavior as opinion leaders are in an advantaged position for access to information and scanning the environment in the community (Valente, 1995). In other words, opinion leaders represent the norm of the community and are respected as influential. According to the two-step flow model of communication (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955), opinion leaders act as intermediaries between mass media and the majority of people in a community. Therefore, the mechanism that opinion leaders facilitate information diffusion is that they stimulate adoption behavior (e.g., retweet a message) of their followers. Followers\u2019 information sharing help create multiple generations of adopters and extend the diffusion chain. Previous studies have showed that opinion leaders were more important than average individuals in diffusing public opinions (Watts & Dodds, 2007), and opinion leaders were critical in accelerating behavioral diffusion (Valente, 1995).

A critical property of online networks is that actors tend to connect with those already connected to their neighbors, leading to local clustering than one would expect by chance (Newman, 2010). Brokers are individuals who bridge distinct clusters or sub-communities in a social network (Burt, 1992). Individuals with high levels of brokerage can reduce the overall distance between others in a network, increasing the likelihood and efficiency of information diffusion in a network (Valente & Fujimoto, 2010). Moreover, bridging ties tend to be weak ties (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010), characterized by the low frequency of contacts and low emotional intensity involved in the relationship (Granovetter, 1973). Weak ties are argued to facilitate information diffusion in that they transmit new and non-redundant information, which is more likely to be picked up by loosely connected groups of individuals (Granovetter, 1973).",

            "text": "Extensive literature has supported the critical role of brokers in transmitting information to a larger scale (Yang & Counts, 2010). For example, a recent study reported that the top 1% of brokers in the follower-followee network controlled 25% of all the information transmission on Twitter (Lou & Tang, 2013). Brokers could show an even greater influence on structural virality given their positional characteristics bridging otherwise unconnected groups. Due to the information asymmetry and low-redundancy between unconnected groups, brokers are able to pass and infuse new information to distinct groups, which helps extend the chain of information diffusion. Research has shown that top brokers controlled almost 80% of the information transmission between different clusters (Lou & Tang, 2013), which primarily determined how far information could travel from its source (Yang & Counts, 2010). Moreover, brokers tend to have more weak ties, and weak ties retransmit information significantly more than strong ties (Bakshy et al., 2012). In other words, information passed along by brokers has a higher chance of being retransmitted in the network, which further extends the diffusion chain (Gonz\u00e1lez-Bail\u00f3n et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2012). Therefore, we propose that.Hypothesis 5 (H5)For diffusion of each unique tweet, the level of involvement of brokers positively predicts its (a) size and (b) structural virality.\n",

Specifically, for each unique tweet whose diffusion we seek to trace, we recorded (1) the retweeter (i.e., the identity of the user who retweeted the tweet); (2) the retweet time (i.e., the time at which the adoption happened); and (3) the identities of all users the retweeter follows \u2013 hereafter referred to as the retweeter's followees \u2013 from whom the retweeter could conceivable have learned about the tweet. For each unique tweet (i.e., each diffusion event), the followee who tweeted the tweet most recently before the focal retweeter was labeled the focal retweeter's \u201cparent\u201d. In our dataset, this method allowed us to trace back to the original author of each unique tweet \u2013 that is CDC \u2013 for all 425 tweets. We then computed structural virality v(T) as the average distance between all pairs of nodes in a diffusion tree T (Goel et al., 2016); that is, for n > 1 nodes,v(T)=1n(n\u22121)\u2211i=1n\u2211j=1ndijwhere dij denotes the length of the shortest path between nodes i and j. The metric v(T) provides a continuous measure of structural virality, with higher values indicating viral diffusion whereas lower values indicating broadcast diffusion (see more details in Appendix A).",

Therefore, these extra message features were controlled in the statistical analysis. To measure these controlled message features, we asked survey respondents to rate to what extent the information in a tweet was novel and entertaining on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). The two trained coders (see Appendix for more details) coded the presence of an image underneath a tweet, the presence of hashtags and URLs in a tweet. The two coder reached an agreement of 99% in coding these content features. In addition, the two coders were asked to write down notes about names of diseases mentioned in each tweet and primary purposes of the tweets (e.g., education, prevention, announcement, etc.) Based on these brief notes, the two coders discussed and inductively generated two broad categories of health topics: health education and prevention, and CDC announcements of events.",

It discovered different sets of predictors in influencing the size and structural virality of diffusion respectively. Among message features based on Information Utility Theory, perceived efficacy was a positive predictor of diffusion size, whereas perceived susceptibility of experiencing a health condition was a positive predictor of structural virality. This finding is unique because it revealed that the threat component of information utility becomes critical in explaining person-to-person diffusion even after controlling for perceived negative emotion such as fear and sadness. Unlike previous literature that has emphasized efficacy as a major indicator of information utility and predictor of information transmission (Cappella, Kim, & Albarrac\u00edn, 2015), our finding pointed out that for health information to go viral, perceived susceptibility of experiencing the negative event should be the core to communicate. Future research is encouraged to consider both the threat and efficacy component (Witte, 1992) of information utility when spreading other content such as environmental issues (e.g., climate change) on social media.",

While the finding is consistent with health information sharing literature on Twitter (McLaughlin et al., 2016), it contradicts sharing health news via email and Facebook (Kim, 2015). Different media platforms can affect what people talk about and share (Berger & Iyengar, 2013) and thus may explain the discrepancies in those findings. Email and Facebook networks involve a great number of pre-existing social relations (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2011), while Twitter network may involve a larger number of strangers or very weak ties as following a Twitter user typically does not require a mutual agreement from both relational parties (Hansen, Arvidsson, Nielsen, Colleoni, & Etter, 2011). Social bonding is an important motivation when sharing information with pre-existing social relations (Berger, 2014). Sharing positive emotions helps build a positive self-image and maintain positive interpersonal relationships. However, when communicating with very weak ties, it may be less important to be a positive or a nice person. Instead, sharing negative-tone messages may attract more attentions from others. Information that arouses negative emotion may signal danger and thus are more urgent and useful (McLaughlin et al., 2016). In addition, passing along negative tweets may show a person's discriminating judgement and heightened cynical sophistication (Cappella et al., 2015), just like we tend to perceive book review writers as more intelligent and competent when they provide negative as opposed to positive reviews (Amabile, 1983). Future research is encouraged to compare diffusion of the same message on different media platforms and examine varying motivations of information sharing.",

The finding does not align with DOI theory that primarily explains adoptions of products or behaviors, but is consistent with the claim of million follower fallacy, such that users with high in-degree are not influential in spawning retweets (Cha, Haddadi, Benevenuto, & Gummadi, 2010). The explanation may be that information differs from products or behaviors in that information utility lies in its non-redundancy (Granovetter, 1973), whereas multiple adoptions of the same product or behavior accelerate diffusion of that product or behavior (Centola, 2010). Users with high in-degree centrality may consider retweeting CDC's posts as spreading redundant and less useful information given that CDC already broadcasts to an enormous number of followers on Twitter. As found in Cha et al. (2010), the positive effect of in-degree centrality on spawning retweets of a user was mainly observed for Twitter users who were mainstream news organizations, but not for other users with high in-degree centrality. An alternative explanation is based on the DOI literature that opinion leaders are usually experts in specific domains (Rogers, 2003). The counts of followers may not help identify opinion leaders in health news. Or the followers of opinion leaders identified in this study may not be interested in health news, and therefore did not retransmit the news.",

This finding further demonstrated the trapping effect of community structures in affecting information diffusion (Onnela et al., 2007), such that viral memes can permeate through many communities, while non-viral memes are often confined within a community (Weng, Menczer, & Ahn, 2013). Given the similarity shared among people in the same community, information tweeted by users who belong to the single community may become old and redundant very soon. In contrast, information tweeted by brokers who connect several communities may be novel and relevant to different groups of people, and thus is more likely to be picked up and retweeted further.",

For example, Madalyn Parker tweeted a message about taking sick days for mental health. The tweet went viral in a way that retweets flowed in conversing about work culture, organizational practice, and stigma surrounding the issue. To increase the virality of health-related tweets, CDC could craft messages that spark storytelling and conversations among the public, which could draw more and longer public's attention.",

Without an adequate control for the viewing count data, our ability remains limited to make inferences about the effects of message- and network-features on information diffusion. Future research may use CDCs' number of followers and a typical exposure rate reported by Twitter as an estimate. Moreover, health messages studied were short given the word limit on Twitter. Twitter users possibly clicked and read the URLs included in the tweet messages before they made the decision about retweet. Therefore, the actual content led by URLs may influence the likelihood of retransmitting information, which was not captured by the current study.",

The single-item measure of perceived novelty in the survey may not have captured the rich meaning of it.

When the number of retweets was smaller (=<100), Twitter Search API was able to return all the retweets. When the number of retweets was greater (>100), the search results had a few missing retweets when comparing with the number of retweets on CDC's timeline. However, the number of missing retweets was very small even among the most retweeted tweets (<10). Therefore, we were confident that we had collected almost all the tweets that meet the search query. The rate limit was 180 requests per 15 min window for per-user authentication, and per request, we could ask for maximum 100 tweets. The grand total limit was 18,000 tweets/15 min. Moreover, we did not use Twitter's API feature such as RT to detect retweets. In our pilot data collection, we found that searching by exact tweet messages returned more accurate number of retweets than using RT, when comparing with the number of retweets shown on CDC's timeline.2.Perceived response-efficacy and self-efficacy were correlated at 0.86, and therefore were not averaged into one index efficacy in the analysis.\n",
