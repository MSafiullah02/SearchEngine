It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8 + T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8 + T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients.",

Indeed, a cytokine storm-related syndrome has been proposed as a trigger of ARDS (3, 4) and in accordance, treatments to control inflammatory cytokine signaling are being used to reduce mortality of COVID-19 patients (5, 6) . However, it is unknown whether specific subsets of innate and adaptive immune cells could be differentially contributing to a dysregulated immune response underlying the development of ARDS in COVID-19. The most recent studies indicate that immune exhaustion of effector T lymphocytes and altered humoral responses (7) (8) (9) , combined with alterations in myeloid cells like monocytes (10, 11) might be related to increased inflammation and contribute to disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Dendritic cells (DC) are a heterogeneous lineage of antigen presenting cells (APC), which includes different subsets of CD123 hi plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) and conventional (cDC) CD1c + and CD141 + DCs. These innate cells are critical for activation of adaptive CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, and are key players in the assess in depth myeloid cell populations in COVID-19 to generate new knowledge that may contribute to the development of effective specific treatments. Additionally, it is important to better understand adaptive antiviral responses potentially present in COVID-19 patients, and how they might be associated with altered myeloid cells. Recent studies suggest that exhausted CD4 + T cell responses might be dysregulated in COVID-19 patients (20), but less is known about antiviral CD8 + T cells, which could be important for virus control. Assessment of a small number of COVID-19 patients suggests that CD8 + T cells infiltrate lungs during the course of the disease, but little information is available about which specific effector subsets are recruited (9) . Therefore, an integrative view of the myeloid and lymphoid populations altered in peripheral blood and lung tissue of the patients and their association to the severity of COVID-19, is clearly needed. In the present study, we contribute to this aim by analyzing the frequencies and activation profiles of different DC and Mo subsets present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different levels of clinical severity and by identifying cell subsets associated with protection or disease progression.",

Using a tSNE tool, we were able to observe differences in mononuclear myeloid cells distribution based on the abundance of cell populations between COVID-19 and healthy control individuals (Fig.1A left) . A more detailed analysis suggested that these changes were due to alterations on specific myeloid subsets in COVID-19 individuals (Fig.1A, right) . An individual analysis of each myeloid subset in blood showed a significant reduction of almost all circulating myeloid cell subsets when considering all COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, certain myeloid populations were more significantly affected in the different patient subgroups. In particular, CD123 hi pDC and CD141 + cDCs were significantly diminished in the three patient groups, suggesting a disease-rather than severity-related impact on these cells (Fig. 1B) . On the other hand, the decrease of CD1c + cDCs, and C and NC Mo was more pronounced in severe G2 and critical G3 COVID-19 patients and therefore indicating an association with severity (Fig. 1B) .",

In addition, big sized CD14 -CD16 hi HLADRgranulocytes were increased in G1 and G2, but not G3 COVID-19 subgroups; and higher ratios of these cells relative to CD1c + DCs were specifically increased in severe G2 patients ( Fig.S2B-2C ).

Our analyses revealed that higher frequencies of circulating C, T and NC Mo (Fig. 1C ) and CD141 + cDCs (Fig. S3B ) were moderately correlated with higher levels of blood oxygenation. Importantly, depletion of C and T Mo from the blood correlated most significantly with higher plasma levels of inflammatory markers such as PCT, CRP and in the case of C and T Mo, with higher IL-6 ( Fig. 1C-D, Fig.S3A ).",

Our previous tSNE analysis involved redistribution of cell populations considering both frequencies and expression of the maturation marker CD40, which has been linked to cellular activation and the expression of IL-6 cytokine (22, 23). As shown in When CD40 expression levels were analyzed within each myeloid cell subset in total and stratified COVID-19 patients, we observed again differences associated with disease severity in some populations (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, CD40 expression tended to be lower in all Mo subsets from G3 patients, but most significantly on T and NC Mo (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, no significant changes in CD40 expression were observed for CD1c + and CD141 + cDC, while a mild downregulation of CD40 occurred on pDC (Fig. S4A) . Remarkably, we observed no significant or weak associations of CD40 expression in cDCs or Mo subsets with plasma IL-6 and PCT levels with the frequency of these subsets in the blood (Fig.S4B-D) . Therefore, these data highlight a differential relationship of innate activation and migration between T and NC Mo versus cDC in COVID-19 patients. 3A) .

Our results indicate that increased proportions of transitional Mo in the blood could be used as a marker of viral control or mild clinical condition in infected patients. In contrast, dramatic decrease of T and NC Mo and CD1c + DC is associated with severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition, our study shows that reduction of frequencies of T and NC Mo in the blood is associated with increased IL-6, and inflammatory markers such as PCT, CRP; this reduction is also associated with the selective recruitment to the lung of these populations and CD1c + cDCs during the development of ARDS. On the other hand, increased activation of NC Mo and defective maturation of T Mo might be associated with uncontrolled inflammation in the lung and the activation of effector CD8 + T cells. Therefore, our data highlight differential involvement of myeloid cell subsets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and immunity against SARS-Co-V2 virus. Although these data provide novel cellular insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, future studies will need to focus on mechanisms responsible for these altered cellular patterns. In this regard, recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses on inflammatory infiltrates in the lung of COVID-19 patients suggest the altered expression of genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines and/or interferons-associated and interferon-stimulated proteins that have been previously associated with the activation of antibacterial innate pathways (10) .",

Therefore, it is possible that COVID-19 patients might be more susceptible to microbial superinfection early or during ICU treatment and this could contribute to changes in inflammation, migration and homeostasis of myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients specifically undergoing severe disease progression. If this was the case, the simultaneous activation of antiviral and antibacterial innate recognition pathways could be a potential mechanism that might contribute to uncontrolled inflammation and immune exhaustion in these individuals, similarly to what has been described in HIV + individuals coinfected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (30).

However, a number of limitations need to be discussed. This is a cross-sectional study design comparing severe COVID-19 patients, with two sets of controls: on the one hand mild/severe COVID-19 patients; and on the other hand non-COVID-19 healthy controls. Because of this cross-sectional nature any assessment of progression will require a confirmation in prospective follow-up studies. In addition, our study provides data on bronchoscopy infiltrates rather than bronchoalveolar lavage given the fragile status of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Although bronchoscopies might not necessarily reflect the characteristics of infiltrates present in terminal bronchioles and alveoli, our data from two patients indicate that the composition of myeloid cells in the infiltrates obtained by these methods are comparable. On the other hand, our study did not directly address the protective versus detrimental function of DC during COVID-19 infection. In this sense, CD141 + cDCs are important for the priming of antiviral CD8 + T cell responses (14, 31) and are dramatically depleted from the blood in all COVID-19 patients regardless of their clinical status, but they are almost completely undetectable in bronchoscopy infiltrates from individuals developing severe ARDS. These data might support a defect on the priming, the maintenance or exhaustion of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in the lungs; however these issues must be investigated in depth. In addition, CD1c + cDCs are known to support CD4 + T cell responses and stimulate follicular helper T cells required for effective humoral antiviral adaptive immunity (13) . While it has been proposed that protection against SARS-CoV-2 might also be at least partially mediated by specific antibodies (32), the role of CD1c + DCs inducing Tfh responses in these patients has not been addressed in our study and requires further research.",

Based on these data, we postulated that recruitment to the lung and activation of Mo and DC subsets might be different in COVID-19 patients developing severe disease and ARDS. Most studies analyzing inflammatory cell populations in the lung have used bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, since they are most representative of deep alveolar structure (24-26). However, clinical features of COVID-19 patients requiring artificial respiratory support make it difficult to collect enough BAL samples to assess significant differences in immune cell subsets. Hence, we assessed the proportions of CD45 + leukocytes (Fig. S5A) and their subsets (see strategy of flow cytometry gating in Fig. S5B) in dense bronchoscopy samples routinely obtained to allow patient ventilation. No significant differences in clinical parameters were observed in bronchoscopy samples with different levels of hematopoietic cell infiltrates(Fig.S5A, bottom). Remarkably, these cell distribution patterns were very similar to those observed in the few cases where a BAL sample could be obtained in parallel(Fig. S5B). Using this approach, a significant enrichment of granulocytes (which represented the vast majority of the leukocytes in those samples, FigS5B-5C), CD16 hi CD14 lo/-HLA-DR + cells(Fig.S5B-5C) and inflammatory T and NC Mo was observed(Fig.",
