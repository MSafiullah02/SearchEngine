            "text": "Background: We present the rationale for a novel allo-priming approach to serve the elderly as a universal anti-virus vaccine, as well serving to remodel the aging immune system in order to reverse immunosenescence and inflammaging. This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next 'Disease X' . Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim \u00ae ) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim \u00ae creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-\u03d2, leading to development of an \"anti-viral state\", by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allospecific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-\u03d2, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/ CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter.",

The NK cell compartment is highly stable in terms of function and phenotype in the elderly [42] and can therefore readily reject mismatched allogeneic cells. In subsequent ID AlloStim \u00ae injections, the production of IFN-\u03d2 and expression of CD40L by AlloStim \u00ae activates macrophages that reject the AlloStim \u00ae [43] . The rejection of the allogeneic cells by NK cells or macrophages in the skin results in release of endogenous HSP and DAMP danger signals [22] , which in the context of CD40L and IFN-\u03d2 expressed by AlloStim \u00ae result in DC maturation to IL-12+ DC1 phenotype and their migration to draining lymph nodes to interact with cognate T-cells to elicit allo-specific Th1/CTL immunity [44] .",

Establishment of the anti-viral state with early release of IFN-\u03d2 provides a crucial initial line of defense against viral infection [91] . The anti-viral state is normally induced through early release of type I/III IFN from viral infected cells [92] . However, many viruses, including coronavirus, can suppress production of type I/III IFN as an immune avoidance mechanism [93] [94] [95] [96] . The strategy of providing a pool of non-exhausted memory cells which produce Type II IFN (IFN-\u03d2) upon viral encounter, overcomes the viral escape. IFN-\u03d2 creates an anti-viral state even in type I/III IFN resistant cells [97] . Further, IFN-\u03d2 mobilizes innate effector cells that can respond rapidly to eliminate viral infection [98] and also produce IFN-\u03d2. Thus, early IFN-\u03d2 response to viral infection through allo-priming provides a rapid means of control over viral infection in the elderly.",

This results in a natural loss of the ability to mount effective innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to invading pathogens. The delayed and suppressed cellular immune response in the elderly enables viruses to become widely established and the resulting increased viral titers causes dys-regulated immune responses that can lead to a late, over-active immune response which can progress to pneumonitis, multiple organ failure and death.",

The presence of non-exhausted Th1/CTL memory immune cells will modify the elderly immune character by providing a Th1 re-balancing mechanism in the memory cell compartment. This is accomplished through the creation of a high titer of polyclonal, allo-specific, non-exhausted, memory Th1/CTL T-cells through intradermal injections of activated allogeneic Th1-like cells (AlloStim \u00ae ). The allo-specific memory cells resulting from the priming are programmed to produce IFN-\u03d2 upon activation. IFN-\u03d2 has a direct anti-viral effect on cells infected with virus and can also protect uninfected cells from infection. IFN-\u03d2 creates the same anti-viral environment as innate release of Type I/III IFN does in an effective natural innate immune response.",

The by-stander effect of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory T-cell activation and IFN-\u03d2 production is predicted to elicit protective effects on cells in the respiratory tract and generate rapid immune-mediated viral clearance as well as condition the microenvironment in infected tissues (e.g., lung epithelial cells) for an in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific immunity and memory that is specific for the invading virus. The heterologous immune effect can amplify the pan-viral protection upon each viral encounter, providing the possibility of long-term protection.",

Co-injection of allo-specific and viral specific antigens could accelerate the adaptive cellular immune response to a known virus and serve as a means to enhance response to vaccines in the elderly. Subsequent injection of allogeneic cells will stimulate an allo-rejection memory recall response which can non-specifically activate resident viral-specific cells elicited by vaccination. This dual activation provides a mechanism to upregulate MHCI on infected targets, making the memory cells elicited by viral-specific vaccination able to identify and kill viral infected targets. The combination approach also has the advantage of overcoming the narrow immunity conferred by a single peptide vaccine by incorporating the in situ vaccination mechanism to elicit broad viral-specific cellular immune responses.",

Currently there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against the prior SARS or MERS outbreaks available anywhere in the world. This is despite considerable efforts from experts worldwide to develop vaccines. The same technical obstacles preventing development of specific vaccines and treatments for these past CoV outbreaks likely also exist for development of a vaccine for the current COVID-19 viral pandemic. However, even if an effective vaccine is developed, it is estimated that it will take at least a year to complete clinical testing sufficient to obtain regulatory approval. If COVID-19 fades as did SARS and MERS, by the time a vaccine is available it will no longer be as urgent.",
