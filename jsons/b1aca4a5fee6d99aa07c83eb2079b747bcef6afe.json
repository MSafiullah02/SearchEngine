However, the recent 'mobilities turn' has helped develop 23 research that moves from a focus on fixed sites, towards the role of everyday movements through 24 places that can contribute to wellbeing (Doughty, 2013) . This emerging body of research focuses largely 25 on the restorative power of mobility to convey the idea that mobility, as well as place, can contribute to 26 improved health and wellbeing. ",

The pressure that members feel to maintain the pace of the group could 406 also have relevance to other group activities, such as cycling groups, long-distance swimmers or park-407 runners, where the therapeutic experience depends on one keeping pace with a group.

This paper has introduced the concept of detrimental mobilities to 432 highlight that shared mobility is not always inherently beneficial for all individuals, thus promoters of 433 walking groups should avoid romanticising their benefits. Taken together, the findings from this study 434 complicate the boundaries between positive and negative therapeutic experiences and the assumption 435 that membership in a walking group is entirely advantageous. These participants are members of the 436 same walking group, therefore health professionals may presume that they each experience the walking 437 group in a similar way and that they all draw the same healing benefits from each walk (Carpenter, 438 2013). Their experiences emphasise the importance of examining mobilities at an individual level, and 439 with a relational approach that recognises the interplay of people and place. The findings promote need for a shift in thinking from walking groups as homogenously beneficial for all members, to also 443 understand the unintended, detrimental impacts of shared walking in older age.",

Walking interviews do not simply reveal how people respond to the 198 environment, but they create certain socio-natural knowledge and spaces. Implying that walking 199 interviews undoubtedly create somehow more authentic data is therefore misleading (ibid). Talking 200 whilst walking is thought to allow people to express their feelings more openly than if sat directly 201 opposite someone, and walking interviews have been celebrated for enhancing rapport between 202 participants and researchers (Ward-Thompson, 2012). However, the presumption that this automatically 203 leads to people being comfortable and open in interviews is too simplistic. ten participants were in stable health and all resided in the Southampton area. Two of the 207 participants were male, which reflects the overall gender makeup of the walking groups and all 208 participants were aged 65 years and over. Participants are involved with the walking group at least once 209 a week and the length of time that participants have attended the walking groups ranges from three 210 months to eight years. The increase in self-responsibility of older adults to maintain their health and 211 wellbeing has been regarded as exclusionary in terms of socio-economic class (Cardona, 2008). The 212 demographic makeup of this study's sample may reflect this, as all participants describe themselves as 213 middle-class and White-British. Hanson and Jones (2015a) refer to the 'inverse prevention law' whereby 214 preventative interventions, such as walking groups, are likely to be less successful in a phenomenological approach to understanding my data as I was concerned with individual's lived 220 experiences (Neubauer et al, 2019). This approach looks at the meaning of experience, both in terms of 221 what is experienced and how it is experienced. By exploring experiences as they are subjectively lived, 222 new understandings can be developed to apprise and possibly reform how certain experiences are 223 understood (Crust et al, 2011; Laverty, 2003), in line with my aim of gaining a more nuanced account of 224 walker experiences. More specifically, I took a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to interpret the 225 participant's lifeworlds while also reflecting on my own experience and the influence of this on the study 226 (Neubauer et al, 2019).",

One such participant is Jean, aged 76, who began 272 attending the Thursday walking group nine months previously. Jean joined the walking group because 273 she often walks through Southampton Common on her own and she decided she would like some 274 company on her walks. Although her daughter lives with her temporarily, Jean feels discontent with her 275 social life and often feels lonely. Like some of the other participants, Jean has had difficulty in making 276 connections with other group members: 277 278 \"There's quite a lot of people that know each other and I don't, and I find that quite exclusive, excluding, 279 and you don't know what to pitch it at.

For Jean and some of the other participants, this lack of deeper connections and their inability 288 to make them, has knocked their confidence and has actually made them feel excluded from other 289 people in the group who have made friends rather than acquaintances.

Despite there being multiple 359 walking groups, originally designed to walk at various speeds and on various routes, some members find 360 they simply cannot 'keep up' with the group. One participant who has a particular issue with this is 361 Eileen aged 75, who has been attending the Thursday walking group for eight years. Possibly due to her 362 lengthy attendance with the walking group, Eileen considers some of the other walkers her closest 363 friends and the opportunity for a weekly catchup with them is integral to her continued attendance with 364 the walking group. Being overweight and diabetic, Eileen was originally referred to the walks by her GP, 365 however over the years she, and some of the other participants, have seen the group change from 366 slower walks for people suggested to attend for their health, to more brisk walks attended by fitter 367 individuals committed to healthy ageing. Eileen highlights a problem with this:368 369 \"Originally it was a doctor's health referral and now it's just anybody, which is a shame because I think of giving it up to be honest, but I don't want to because I do enjoy it and I think it's lovely up 372 here... I prefer not to walk on unsafe ground and also it does slow me down quite a bit... the pavements 373 sometimes they're very up and down and if I'm walking along with you, instead of looking at you, I'm 374 looking at the pavement to make sure I don't trip\" (Eileen, aged 75) 375 376 Janet, aged 74, has also been attending the walking group for eight years and like Eileen, she has 377 witnessed a shift in the purpose of the group: 378 379 \"Originally it was set up for people that were trying to get fitter, but now it seems to have evolved into a 380 group where people are all at a fairly fit level because I've noticed if people join and they're not good at 381 walking, they tend not to come back. Because it seems to have evolved into like a walking group, not 382 walking for fitness\" (Janet, aged 74) 383 384 Relational aspects of changing place conditions, such as changes in terrain and conditions of terrain e.g. 385 wet ground, slippery leaves etc, can cause obstacles for older adults who may have health or mobility 386 limitations (Finlay, 2018). Especially for older adults in walking groups, who not only have to negotiate 387 the changing landscape, but also read social cues, follow the route and speed of the group and 388 participate in conversations. During the interview, both Eileen and Janet walked slow and paid close 389 attention to where we were walking. The routes they chose were simple and short, and they stuck to 390 the main paths of Southampton Common. However, the main paths were not always stuck to by the 391 walking groups, and Eileen explained that if the route of the walking group crossed some of the other 392",
