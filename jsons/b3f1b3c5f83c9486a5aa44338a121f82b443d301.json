The amount of genome data deposited in public repositories in a such a reduced timeframe offers a unique opportunity for a detailed phylogenetical characterization of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the geographic mapping of the different clades spreading worldwide, and of the impact of the outbreaks on the genome variability of the virus. Initial analyses so far used a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes only, and focused mostly on various evolutionary aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (1-4). We built a solid phylogenetic skeleton of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that allows to investigate sequence variation in a large number of genomes (>4,700; Supplementary Material) deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data GISAID (5), explore site-specific mutational instability, investigate phylogeographic patterns of variation worldwide, and clarify the role of super-spreader hosts in the pandemic.",

H3 (n = 132; B1a1) appears at remarkably high frequency and almost exclusively in USA (126/132; 95.45%; B1a1). H4 (n = 78; A) corresponds to the reference sequence (GenBank acc. n\u00ba MN908947.3) and it reaches the highest frequency in Asia (60/78; 76.92%), particularly in China (49/78; 62.82%); the frequency of H4 increased in two pulses, one coinciding with its first appearance in China at the end of December 2019, and the next coinciding with the large Asian outbreak in mid-February 2020; later, H4 moved to other non-Asian locations, e.g. USA (10/78; 12.82%). There are additional examples of SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader hosts (Table S8) appearing in restricted geographical areas. For instance, H8 (n = 33; A3) appears at high frequency in Japan (28/33; 84.85%). In Iceland, founder haplotypes represent a large proportion of all existing haplotypes on the island 8 e.g. H7 exists only in Iceland (n = 37), and together with H2 (n = 34 in Iceland) and other four haplotypes, makes up 39.18% of all the haplotypes in this country. In USA, H3 occurs 126 times, and H2 45 times; together with other five haplotypes, they make up 31.75% of all genomes in this country. In the UK, eight haplotypes make-up 28.95% of the total haplotypes. H9 (n = 26; B3a) and H14 (n = 22; A2a5) are probably the main haplotypes responsible for the Spanish outbreak; H9 (21/26 in Spain; 80.77%) is particularly interesting because it belongs to haplogroup B3a, while almost all European haplotypes belong to haplogroup A (Supplementary Material; Figure S9); H14 appears 9 times in Spain (9/22; 40.91%). Common haplotypes are frequently shared between neighboring countries, an observation mirroring the easy spread of the virus over short geographic distances; for instance, H33 (n = 9; of which 7 are in Portugal and 2 in Spain) or H45 (n = 7; of which 4 are in Portugal and 1 in Spain). Evolution of effective population size of SARS-CoV-2 Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot (EBPS) analysis undertaken on genomes sampled until the end of February (see Supplementary Material) reflects with great precision the main COVID-19 epidemiological episodes. If we consider the estimated TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 to 12 th November 2019 and allow 14-24 days of disease incubation (until approximately the 6 th of December), this leaves a period of two or three weeks of silent local transmission of the virus until the first case is reported in Wuham on 30 th December 2019.

These SARS-CoV-2 strains (belonging to different haplogroups), occur with remarkable frequency in the dataset and became founders in restricted regions or countries in short time periods (of a few days). SARS-CoV-2 genomes show very high identity among themselves (>99%) and lower to bat coronaviruses (>96%; BatCoV RaTG13); these values are very identical to earlier estimates based on a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (6). The pangolin coronavirus genome, initially proposed as the original host of SARS-CoV-2, shows significantly lower identity. The high identity observed between SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other betacoronaviruses adds support to its zoonotic origin from a bat relative (6). The differences found between SARS-CoV-2 and their most related coronaviruses in horseshoe bat indicate that large number of mutational jumps were needed to generate these differences from a common ancestor which could have existed in a time frame between 1948-1982 (7). Divergent genomes could have been incubated in animal reservoirs before the zoonotic jump to humans in the shape of a B1 genome, in a process similar to that observed for palm civet as intermediary in other SARS coronavirus (8). These new coronaviruses would be able to use human ACE2 receptor to infect patients. Patterns of variation observed in SARS-CoV-2 could be explained assuming a unique index case, which would already contain the very specific and well-conserved PFCS insertion. This original B1 genome would then start to diverge very soon in Wuham in two directions of the phylogeny, giving rise to its most frequent sub-lineage B1a1 and, almost simultaneously, to other B lineages and the large haplogroup A (timeline in figure 3C). According to our inferences, the TMRCA for all SARS-CoV-2 genomes would be 12 th November 2019. Assuming a maximum incubation time in humans of up to 24 days (9), the virus could have been infecting the first citizens from Hubei in a silent mode of transmission until the end of November 2019; and started to be noticed by Chinese health authorities in early to mid-December. The EBSP distribution suggests that the N e of SARS-CoV-2 could have started to grow significantly from 30 th December 2019, i.e. only two-three weeks after the initial cases reported and probably favored by super-spreader hosts (e.g. genomes like the reference sequence played a special role in the beginning of the Asiatic epidemic). Subsequently, it followed an exponential growth that marked the beginning of the Asian outbreak on the 20 th January drop coinciding with human intervention and quarantine implemented in Asia on 1 1",

In agreement with this latter observation is the recent report indicating a 81 deletion at gene ORF7a that would convert the coronavirus in a less virulent pathogen with reduced short-term selective advantage (10). None of the HQ genomes investigated in our report carry this deletion.In contrast to the weak (or null) action of positive selection on COVID-19 spread, there is strong evidence pointing to the role of genetic drift occurring in many continental regions and restricted locations, especially outside China.",

This segment is therefore highly mutationally stable. A BLAST search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) of the PFCS indicates that this sequence segment is absolutely specific of SARS-CoV-2. The fact that the PFCS has been found universally in all SARS-CoV-2 suggests that this insertion was acquired before the zoonotic event and not after (3). The virulence conferred by this deletion to the coronavirus constitutes the focus of several studies (13). The origin of SARS-CoV-2 has become a very popular question. The results of the present study (TMRCA dating of SARS-CoV-2, EBSP plot, and phylogeny) are compatible with an index case living in Wuhan-China, belonging to basal haplogroup B1, and most likely existing not before the beginning of November 2019. Subsequently, the coronavirus was transmitted from a living animal to a human host and then it started to spread from human to human. By analyzing stored biological samples from cases occurring at the beginning of the epidemy in Wuhan, it would be possible to narrow the search for patient zero among those belonging to the root of B1. The phylogeny built in the present study would be compatible with a single patient zero initiating the epidemic. Identifying the index case would help better understand how and when the spread of the pandemic begun, a lesson that would be useful in future pandemics. In agreement with previous studies (3), the theory of SARS-CoV-2 originating artificially in a lab finds no support in the results of the present study, in the sense that variation (within and between other species), and the stepwise mutational evolution observed at SARS-CoV-2 genomes is as expected for a RNA virus in nature. This study warrants further expansion to clarify the role of superspreaders in COVID-19 by investigating epidemiological data locally. Detecting and analyzing the genome of super-spreaders might shed light on the specific Legend to the Figures Inter-specific ML tree indicating the root of all existing SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",
