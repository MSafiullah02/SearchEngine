Recurrent infections later in life are inevitable and are usually asymptomatic or accompanied by mild symptoms [3].",

The two envelop proteins, glycoproteins G and fusion protein F constitute the viral antigens that trigger the humoral and cellular immune response of the host [5]. The G protein mediates attachment of RSV to its host cell, while the F protein triggers the fusion of the viral envelop with the cell plasma membrane during viral penetration. Moreover, the F protein mediates the fusion between neighboring cells resulting in syncytia formation, which is the most common method of virus propagation [5].",

Studies have demonstrated that cells undergo different biologic responses when grown in 3D compared with 2D settings [13,14]. They can differ in their morphology, with an altered cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. Other changes include different proliferation rates, signaling processes and differentiation potential. Many of these differences are believed to result from the fact that cells grown as monolayers on flat plastic surfaces are not subjected to the cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions, soluble factors, matrix composition and stiffness, oxygen and nutrient gradients, protein concentration gradients and mechanical stresses, as they would in their source tissues [10].",

A prominent RSV-F protein staining was noted at day 3 post-inoculation (Fig. 3A) that disseminated towards the core of the spheroid by day 7 post-inoculation (Fig. 3B). Mild syncytia formation induced by RSV infection was also noted at the spheroid rim at 3 days post-inoculation (Fig. 3A insets). The intensity of RSV-F protein staining increased by 2-fold on day 7 compared to day 3 post-inoculation (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that the virus has effectively infected the spheroids spreading towards its center throughout infection. Additionally, a 2.6-fold increase in MUC1 expression was noted in the spheroids on day 3 post-infection compared to mock (uninfected). MUC1 production further increased, reaching 3.25-fold at day 7 post-inoculation relative to mock (Fig. 3D). These results are indicative of a progressive infection established in the form of virus dissemination within the spheroids and gradual mucin accumulation, a hallmark of RSV infection.",

Previous studies revealed that spheroids are more representative models for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica compared to monolayer cultures in terms of invasiveness, histopathology, and immunopathology [33,34]. Cells grown in spheroids were also shown to be the first definitive model for human norovirus [18] and hepatitis C virus studies [19], which lacked a suitable cell culture and murine study models. These viruses were capable of replicating and triggering a cytopathic effect in the 3D spheroid. Moreover, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and coronavirus have all been successfully studied in 3D cultures [17]. Recently, Zou et al. [35] developed human adult stem cell (ASC)-derived airway 3D that can be utilized to assess infectivity of emerging influenza viruses to human. Another work by Imle and colleagues introduced a 3D culture of primary human CD4 T lymphocytes as an ex vivo model system to study HIV-1 in tissue-like microenvironments [36]. Here, we established a simple and economic 3D spheroid culture of alveolar type II epithelial cells (A549) as a model to study RSV infection. This culture model can provide a tool for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RSV pathogenesis and to potentially test the effectiveness of antiviral molecules.",

In vitro, when A549 monolayers were infected with RSV, MUC1 secretion was only recorded for up to 3 days, after which it started to decline [37,38]. Contrary, studies performed on monolayers of primary human airway epithelial cells report syncytium formation and increased mucin production for up to 6 days post-infection [[39], [40], [41]]. Our results showed that A549 cells grown in spheroids are susceptible and permissive of RSV, which disseminated to the center of the spheroids and induced excessive mucin secretion for up to 7 days post-infection accompanied with syncytia formation. This shows that A549 cells in spheroids behave more closely to primary cells than to A549 monolayers in terms of mucin production and syncytia formation upon RSV infection. Furthermore, we showed that the infection was productive up to day 7 post-inoculation with the virus progressively spreading towards the center of the spheroid. Notably, the virus yield dropped on day by one log10 pfu/ml, which could be explained by the cell death happening at the core of the spheroids. Overall, our data clearly show that A549 spheroids constitute a promising model of RSV infection studies.",

Therefore, 3D cultures might be a promising in vitro model candidate for studying RSV that can bridge the gap between monolayers and in vivo models due to its permissiveness, sustainability of RSV infection, and its ability to recapitulate the lung epithelial tissue\u2019s response to infection. More importantly, they are cheap and simple to generate. However, this model is not without its limitations such as the lack of vasculature, tissue heterogeneity and fluid flows observed in vivo. Therefore, more work is required to make these 3D cultures ideal model systems to study virus-host interactions and maximize their translational utility.",
