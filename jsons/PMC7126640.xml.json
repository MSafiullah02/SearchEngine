            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important chronic viral diseases of pigs [1]. The causal organism of this disease is PRRS virus (PRRSV), which belongs to the family Arteviridae in the order Nidovirales [2]. The clinical signs of PRRS are reproductive failure, abortion, and high pre-weaning mortality [3]. PRRSV causes immunosuppression resulting in susceptibility of pigs to other poly-microbial infections [4], [5]. The virus induces weak, innate immune responses as a result of reduced IFN-\u03b1 production and dampened natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity [5], [6], which lead to a weak/delayed adaptive immune response. Although increased PRRSV specific antibodies are generated early post-infection, virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies appear quite late and remain at low levels [7]. A killed PRRSV vaccine is available but it has failed to provide adequate protection. A modified-live PRRS virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) has been in use to control clinical PRRS in young pigs. Unfortunately, like the PRRSV infection, PRRS-MLV also induces delayed neutralizing antibody and dampened cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses [8], [9], [10]. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficacy of PRRSV live vaccines to control PRRS effectively.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 produced by myeloid cells initiates the virus specific adaptive immune response [11]. Additionally, the CMI response is manipulated by the metabolism of an essential amino acid, l-arginine, whose level in the body is modulated by the enzymes arginase (1 and 2) and nitric oxide synthase [12]. The role of arginase in viral infections of the respiratory tract or in vaccination is limited, however, arginase 2 deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to viral infections [13]. The requirement of arginase to abort the multiplication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been reported [14]. In contrast, uncontrolled replication of Leishmania was correlated with enhanced arginase activity [15].",

Nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissues contain the entire repertoire of immune cells and are strategically located to orchestrate regional immune functions against airborne infections [16]. Therefore, effective mucosal vaccination is an appropriate strategy to provide protection against various infectious agents. Protective mucosal immunity is mediated by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and NK cells in HSV genital infections [17]. Similarly, intranasal delivery of an influenza vaccine FluMist (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) provided immunity comparable to that induced by a natural infection [18], [19]. An added advantage of mucosal vaccination is that it can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses [20]. Intranasal immunization of HIV-liposome resulted in an effective virus specific immune response at both mucosal and systemic sites [21].",

Mucosal administration of a live attenuated vaccine with a suitable adjuvant induces long lasting protection in various studies performed in bovine herpes virus-1, influenza, and parainfluenza-3 virus [24], [25], [26]. Killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an excellent candidate adjuvant used in the preparation of Freund's complete adjuvant [27], but its use in humans and in food animals is contraindicated due to a severe granulomatous inflammatory reaction induced at the injection site. This adverse effect results from toxic cell wall components of Mtb (such as mycolic acids, arabinogalactan, wax D) [28], [29]. However, adjuvanticity of various purified components of Mtb have been evaluated individually with satisfactory results [30], [31]. In particular, certain individual components and a total fraction of whole cell lysate (WCL) of Mtb free from its toxic cell wall constituents have been demonstrated to possess superior adjuvanticity in rodents, guinea pigs, and rabbits [32], [33], [34], [35]. However, the knowledge related to mucosal adjuvanticity of Mtb WCL to protect against viral infections of the respiratory tract is limited.",

Initially, we performed studies in pigs to choose a suitable bacterial candidate to use as a mucosal adjuvant by inoculating nine different bacterial preparations belonging to Mycobacterium, Vibrio, and Streptococcus species intranasally; the detailed results of which will be presented elsewhere. From that study, we selected Mtb WCL for its potent adjuvant properties such as its ability to augment PRRSV specific Th1 cytokines and immune cells, and suppress immunosuppressive responses. In this study, immune responses of pigs administered PRRS-MLV+/\u2212 Mtb WCL intranasally were evaluated at both mucosal and systemic sites.",

In contrast, PRRSV specific VN titers at PID 7, 21 and 35 were significantly higher in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL vaccinated pigs compared to PRRS-MLV alone inoculated animals (Fig. 2C).

We detected an increased frequency of NK cells in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs; however, the NK cell frequency was comparable to mock pigs in PRRS-MLV alone received pigs. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates NK cell function rather than its frequency in pig lungs. NK cells play two major roles in antiviral defense such as secretion of cytokines (predominantly IFN-\u03b3), and lysis of infected and transformed cells. PRRSV infection suppresses the NK cell cytotoxic function in pigs [5]. In a recent study, 25 pigs experimentally infected with a PRRSV showed approximately a 50% reduction in their NK cell killing function just two days post-infection (Dwivedi and Renukaradhya 2011, unpublished data). Now we report that PRRS-MLV delivered intranasally also suppresses the NK cell cytotoxic function; however, when PRRS-MLV was administered with Mtb WCL, an increased frequency with moderate rescue in their function was observed. Enhanced production of theTh1cytokine IL-12 in the lungs of PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs was detected early (PID 7 and 15). IL-12 is critical for augmenting the innate NK cell function and is responsible for the induction of protective mucosal immunity against intracellular pathogens [9], [54]. Direct NK-DCs crosstalk in mucosally vaccinated animals with adjuvant resulted in enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses [55].",

Glutamine is an important fuel for lymphocytes and macrophages, and plasma glutamine is decreased in HIV infected individuals, where a decrease in the levels of glutamine impairs lymphocyte function [77]. The amino acid proline promotes the growth and differentiation of B-cells and also NK cell activity [78], [79]. Therefore, one of the immune dysregulation mechanisms of PRRSV in pig lungs appears to be mediated through downregulation of arginase, because reduced intracellular arginase was detected in pigs inoculated intranasally with PRRS-MLV. Therefore, mucosal immunization with Mtb WCL has the potential to rescue an important molecular mechanism mediated by the enzyme arginase in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV. Considering the modulation of function of arginase by PRRS-MLV, the direct role of arginase on anti-PRRSV specific mucosal immunity needs to be investigated in detail.",

Further, in continuation of this study, adjuvanticity of Mtb WCL was also confirmed in post-challenge studies which detected a cross-protective immunity to a genetically variant PRRSV MN184 [80]. Considering the fact that PRRS-MLV by itself has the ability to reduce PRRSV viremia and is capable of providing partial protection, it may be a fruitful approach to use this vaccine along with Mtb WCL intranasally. The ability of Mtb WCL to overcome immunosuppression and to augment the virus specific CMI response opens up new avenues to explore its mucosal adjuvanticity against other viral infections.",
