            "text": "The TLR family of pathogen recognition receptors is a diverse and important part of the innate immune system in vertebrates. TLRs recognize PAMPs derived from a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses. Chicken TLRs orthologous to human TLRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have been identified (Brownlie et al., 2009, Iqbal et al., 2005, Yilmaz et al., 2005). Chickens also have certain TLRs that do not have significant homology with human TLR sequences, but recognize similar PAMPs. For example, chicken TLR21 has been demonstrated to play a role similar to that of human TLR9 in recognizing CpG DNA motifs from viruses or bacteria (Brownlie et al., 2009). TLRs contain multiple leucine-rich repeats in their ligand-binding ectodomain and recognize various PAMPs, ranging from extracellular structures (e.g. lipopolysaccharide) to nucleic acids, such as dsRNA (Jin and Lee, 2008). Most TLRs trigger a signaling pathway, which involves MyD88. However, signaling triggered by TLR3, is dependent on the TRIF co-adaptor molecule (Brikos and O\u2019Neill, 2008).",

            "text": "TLR3 is primarily localized in endosomes and recognizes dsRNA molecules of at least 40\u201350 bp in length (Liu et al., 2008). However, recent findings have also suggested an additional dsRNA binding site on human TLR3 that can bind RNA duplexes as short as 21 bp (Pirher et al., 2008). Further, Kleinman et al. (2008) reported that shorter siRNA molecules can bind cell-surface TLR3 in mice. Poly(I:C), a dsRNA analogue, is a well characterized TLR3 agonist and a potent inducer of type I interferons (IFNs) in many cell-types including myeloid dendritic cells, intestinal epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Matsumoto et al., 2004). TLR7, another sensing receptor of viral nucleic acids, can be activated by sequence-specific ssRNA as well as dsRNA duplexes of 19\u201321 bp in length (Heil et al., 2004). Various ssRNA and siRNA-sized dsRNA molecules have been used to activate mammalian TLR7 (Judge et al., 2005). In chickens, TLR7 is suggested to be present mainly in B cells and T cells (Iqbal et al., 2005) and ligation of both TLR3 and 7 with their ligands results in type I IFN production (Judge et al., 2005, Karpala et al., 2008, Philbin et al., 2005). Type I IFNs, which include IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are released in large quantities by the immune system cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, and in lesser quantities by most other cell types, such as fibroblasts. Type I IFNs are usually expressed by host cells in response to viral infections and they induce a generalized antiviral state in infected cells as well as in neighboring cells (Kindt et al., 2006).",

To take this further, we designed a 21-mer dsRNA molecule comprised completely of UG repeats on the sense strand (Table 1\n).

            "text": "The present study demonstrated immunostimulatory properties of some dsRNA molecules in chicken splenocytes. The choice of dsRNA sequences was based on the previous studies that reported immunostimulation by some of these oligonucleotides in mammalian cells (Diebold et al., 2006, Hornung et al., 2005, Judge et al., 2005, Robbins et al., 2008, Sioud, 2005). In chickens, Karpala and colleagues (2008) recently showed that treatment of splenocytes with poly(I:C) resulted in induction of type I IFNs and this effect was found to be TLR3-dependent. However, the effects of synthetic dsRNA molecules other than poly(I:C) in chicken splenocytes were not investigated. The present study showed that all four synthetic dsRNA molecules used in this study induced significant up-regulation of TLR3 and 7 transcripts at one of the early time points (2 or 4 h) post-stimulation (Fig. 2A and B). However, only poly-UG dsRNA (50 nM) was found to significantly up-regulate TLR3 at both 2 and 4 h in addition to increased TLR7 and IFN-\u03b1 transcripts at 2 h post-stimulation. This observation indicated that poly-UG dsRNA oligonucleotide may have enhanced immunostimulatory effects compared to the other dsRNA oligonucleotides that were evaluated in this study. Further investigation of the immunostimulatory effects of poly-UG dsRNA revealed a significant increase in cellular expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, TLR3 and TLR7 genes at 12 and 18 h post-stimulation (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In the case of TLR3 and TLR7, TLR7 gene expression was also found significantly up-regulated as early as 1 h post-stimulation (Fig. 4A and B), whereas the expression of both TLR3 and 7 showed a trend (p\n > 0.05) towards up-regulation at 3, 6 and 12 h post-stimulation. Based on the above observation of an increased expression of TLR3 and TLR7 genes, it may be concluded that the poly-UG-induced up-regulation of IFN-\u03b1 genes is mediated by TLR3- or TLR7. In this regard, IFN-\u03b1 produced by splenocytes may further up-regulate TLR3 or TLR7 by acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner (Karpala et al., 2008, Miettinen et al., 2001, Sir\u00e9n et al., 2005). Induction of type I IFN production was also supported by the corresponding transcriptional elevation of the IFN-inducible gene, 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS in the present study. In addition, transcriptional up-regulation of type I IFN along with other pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, was observed at 12 or 18 h post-stimulation, suggesting a delayed inflammatory response by the splenocytes.",

            "text": "Sequence-dependent immunostimulation seems to be an important phenomenon in virus-associated PAMP recognition by TLRs. For example, two recent studies that screened various dsRNA molecules for immunostimulation in human PBMCs, which included four of the sequences used in the present study, found that siSC2 dsRNA and \u03b2-gal dsRNA were potent inducers of type I IFN production compared to other molecules (Judge et al., 2005, Robbins et al., 2008). In contrast, these same siSC2 and \u03b2-gal dsRNAs did not show appreciable immunostimulation in the present study compared to poly-UG dsRNA, indicating that the RNA-sensing specificities of TLR3/7 may vary across species. This observation can further be supported by the findings of Philbin et al. (2005) who did not observe immunostimulation in chicken splenocytes with two ssRNA molecules that had shown type I IFN production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Heil et al., 2004). This disparity in stimulatory effects of RNA sequences between mammalian and avian species may have resulted from the differences in their evolutionary development of the components of innate immune system. Therefore, it can be speculated that recognition of ligands by TLRs is governed by certain subtle species-specific differences; thus, chickens may respond to a different repertoire of immunostimulatory RNA sequences.",

This may be due to differences in the nature and sequences of RNA molecules since human PBMCs are shown to exhibit different degrees of immunostimulation when treated with sense, anti-sense, or duplex RNA molecules (Judge et al., 2005). Importantly, poly-UG dsRNA stimulation of splenocytes had more prolonged immunostimulatory effects compared to poly(I:C).",

To our knowledge, this temporal expression in response to poly(I:C) stimulation has not been demonstrated in the avian system, though it has been examined in human NK cells (Duluc et al., 2009). Transcription of IFN-\u03b3 in mammals has been shown to be mediated by IFN-\u03b2 in an autocrine fashion (Duluc et al., 2009). This mechanism may also exist in the chicken, because in the present study, a significant increase in IFN-\u03b2 transcription was observed up to 3 and 6 h post-stimulation with a corresponding significant increase in IFN-\u03b3. However, poly-UG dsRNA stimulation of chicken splenocytes was not associated with an increase in IFN-\u03b3 transcription in the present study, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 expression in response to stimulation by dsRNA molecules may be questionable and may depend on the length and sequences of dsRNA oligonucleotides.",
