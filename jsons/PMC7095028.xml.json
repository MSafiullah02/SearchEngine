Subsequently, he was found to have complete absence of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness caused by a homozygous mutation in the IFN-\u03b3 receptor 1 gene6 (Table).\nAt age 3 years, he developed disseminated cytomegalovirus infection with pneumonia, diagnosed by positive cultures of blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as visualization of typical cytomegalic inclusion cells in the latter; he required mechanical ventilation and prolonged therapy with ganciclovir, administered intravenously. Two months later, he developed parainfluenza virus type 3 pneumonia, diagnosed by culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which was complicated by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Five months later he had severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, diagnosed by culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, for which mechanical ventilation was again required. This infection was treated with aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous RSV immune globulin (RespiGam; Medimmune, Gaithersburg, Md). On 2 subsequent occasions he developed pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, although no specific causative agents were identified.",

At age 3 he developed oral ulcers, vesicular skin lesions, and severe retrosternal pain associated with eating, which resulted in weight loss. Herpes simplex virus was isolated from an oral lesion. Within 3 days of beginning oral acyclovir therapy (60 mg/kg/d), his appetite improved, and he was back to normal within 1 week. Acyclovir therapy was continued for 3 weeks. Approximately 5 weeks later, he had a recurrence of oral lesions similar in appearance to those of the prior episode, not associated with retrosternal pain. He was treated with acyclovir, administered orally, without further recurrence of lesions.",

Genetic analysis showed heterozygosity for a mutant IFN-\u03b3 receptor allele containing a single nucleotide insertion (817insA), which codes for a protein with dominant negative function.8 At age 17 years he developed shortness of breath, with numerous vesicular skin, pharyngeal, and lingual lesions. Patchy infiltrates were seen on chest x-ray film, and mechanical ventilation was required for progressive respiratory failure. Electron microscopy performed on scrapings from skin lesions showed viral particles consistent with a herpes group virus, and serology confirmed a diagnosis of acute varicella.

It acts via its cognate receptor to directly stimulate antimicrobial activities of monocytes/ macrophages, and it plays a major role in activation of cell-mediated immunity. IFN-\u03b3 was first recognized for its in vitro antiviral activity.9 Its importance in the in vivo immune response has since been confirmed in mice with targeted disruptions of the IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3 receptor genes. These knockout mice have increased susceptibility to a wide spectrum of infectious agents, including mycobacteria,10, 11, 12, 13 bacteria,14, 15, 16 parasites,17, 18, 19, 20 and viruses. After experimental inoculation, infections with the DNA viruses HSV,21, 22 murine CMV,23 murine gammaherpesvirus,24 and vaccinia virus25 are more prolonged and/or severe in these knockout mice than in normal mice. Single-strand RNA viruses pathogenic in these mouse models include Theiler\u2019s virus,26 lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,25, 27 and mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus).28\n",

Sixteen French children with idiopathic disseminated bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin infection, identified in a national retrospective survey, were reported to have had normal clinical courses and frequency of infections with common childhood pathogens, including varicella.29 However, genetic and immunologic defects in those patients were not known and are likely to be heterogeneous, making comparison with the patients in this report difficult. In a small group of patients with IFN-\u03b3 receptor deficiency, Jouanguy et al30 reported normal recovery from infections caused by rotavirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, RSV, and varicella zoster virus and positive serologies for HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, and CMV without histories of clinical disease. Explanations for this apparent discrepancy include the possibilities that: (1) some patients with IFN-\u03b3 receptor dysfunction may have additional genetic factors that affect their susceptibility to viral infections; (2) viral disease may be favored by concomitant mycobacterial infection and poor clinical status; and (3) as more children with IFN-\u03b3 receptor mutations are identified, a broader spectrum of infection susceptibility may become apparent.",
