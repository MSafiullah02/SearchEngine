            "text": "Cruise ship travel has gained tremendous popularity over the last three decades. In 2005, 11.5 million passengers sailed on North American cruises, representing a 2,100% percent increase since 1970.1., 2. A fleet of 192 cruise ships, with 245,755 beds, sailed at 100% capacity that same year. Surveys show that the top three reasons for passenger satisfaction with cruise vacations are being pampered, having the chance to visit several locations and fine dining.1 In fact, the modern-day cruise ship has evolved since the early 1900s, when passenger ships were virtually the only means of crossing the ocean and when the focus was on efficient transatlantic transportation.3 The speed of jet air travel changed the focus of cruise ship travel to the pleasure of the voyage itself. Cruise destinations such as the Caribbean and Mediterranean gained popularity due to climate as well as accessibility to many ports. Over time cruise ships have come to resemble floating luxury resorts.3 The ever-expanding cruise itineraries, which include diverse ports of call, along with a growth in the number of embarkation ports and onboard amenities, provide travelers with convenient and comfortable means to sample different parts of the world in a short amount of time.1\n",

Many communicable diseases seen on board cruise ships are also on land.4 However, disease exposure and transmission aboard ships may be exacerbated by the densely populated, semiclosed cruise environment, which compels international passengers and crew to share many activities and resources.4., 5., 6. Moreover, a ship can acquire new infectious disease reservoirs while in port through contaminated food and water or infected people.7 Environmental contamination on cruise ships and infected crew and passengers who remain on board during successive voyages may result in protracted outbreaks on cruises.8., 9. An infectious disease acquired during the voyage may incubate in people disembarking from cruise ships and result in outbreaks in the travelers' home communities, especially in closed settings (such as nursing homes).8 Therefore, the public health significance of illness aboard cruises lies not only in possible widespread illness onboard ships, but also the spread of diseases into communities all over the world.",

They include sailboats, yachts, river cruise ships, and ocean cruise ships.11 Sailboats and yachts are best known for niche travel, such as \u201ceco-touring.\u201d River cruises are popular for providing an informal, intimate atmosphere while traveling to places such as the Nile and the Amazon.2 Ocean cruises make up the greatest portion of ship-based leisure travel, with the North American cruise industry accounting for the major part of the global ocean cruise market. The North American cruise industry consists of cruise lines that primarily market cruises to North Americans, but have embarkation ports all over the world.12 Nevertheless, North American ports, particularly those in the United States, handle the vast majority (83% and 75%, respectively) of all global embarkations. The North American cruise industry provides significant benefits to the U.S. economy, creating 330,000 jobs and generating $33 billion in 2005.12., 13. During the same year, 8.6 million cruise passengers embarked on cruises from U.S. ports, with 56% of all cruise ship passengers sailing out of ports in Florida. Seaports in Puerto Rico and Canada handled 5% each, and those in rest of the world (primarily Europe and the Mediterranean) had 16% of global embarkations in 2005.12., 13. The Caribbean remained the top cruise destination, followed by the Mediterranean, other parts of Europe, Alaska, and Mexico.1 Depending on the type of cruise, the duration can range from a day (e.g. gambling cruises) to several months (e.g. round-the-world cruises). The average length of a cruise is 7 days, and approximately 55% of cruising passengers choose 6\u2013 to 8-day cruises.1 The typical 7-day cruise allows passengers ample time to visit 3\u20135 ports and explore different locales and cultures. For many travelers the ship is a destination in itself, offering luxurious accommodation, a variety of food, exciting activities, and relaxation.",

CLIA also notes that 17% of the U.S. population has already cruised once in their lifetime, with more than 50% of that number having been on a cruise more than once.1 In fact, 79% of all cruise passengers are U.S. residents. Compared with U.S. resident noncruise vacationers (defined by those spending 3 nights or more away from home for leisure trips), cruisers tend to be older (51% are over the age of 50 years), have higher income levels, and be likely to plan a vacation 4\u20135 months in advance,1 allowing time for pretravel health preparation. A typical cruise ship will have a passenger-to-crew ratio of around 3:1.3., 14. Cruise ships employ crew members from all over the world; on average, 50 nationalities will be represented in a crew of 1,200.15 The origin of crew members will depend on the cruise line and the designated occupation on the ship.

            "text": "The international character of today's cruise industry is manifested not only by the variety of worldwide ports and the nationalities of passengers, crew members, and company ownership, but also by the flag status, or maritime registry, of the individual cruise ships. The flag or maritime registry administration is a regulatory agency that oversees the operational procedures, ship specifications, crew qualifications, practices, and conformity to laws of commercial vessels registered in a particular country.11., 16., 17. Cruise lines may register their ships with maritime agencies in countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They often choose to register their ships in the country of ownership of the cruise line or the site of the ship's production. Some cruise lines opt to register their ships in countries that provide open maritime registration or \u201cflags of convenience.\u201d Panama, Liberia, and the Bahamas are three such countries that allow foreign vessel owners to register their ships through their respective flag administrations. Together they account for more than 20% of the world's merchant fleet maritime registrations, including many cruise ships. The \u201cflag of convenience\u201d concept originated in Panama just after World War I, when U.S. merchant and passenger vessel registrations began to be transferred to Panama to take advantage of favorable tax incentives and to avoid restrictive prohibition laws.16., 17. The open maritime registrations continue to provide the respective countries with a substantial revenue flow and the registrants with significant financial advantages pertaining to tax, labor, and liability costs. Each flag state, whether it provides open maritime registrations or the more traditional maritime state flag status, is required to be an International Maritime Organization (IMO) member nation and abide by its maritime safety resolutions, conventions, and codes.",

            "text": "The concept of monitoring health aboard ships emerged during the 14th century plague epidemic, when \u201cblack death,\u201d arrived from the East and swept across Europe. To prevent the entry and spread of disease and protect commerce, Venice enforced a mandatory 40-day anchor and observation of ships arriving from affected regions. This practice came to be known as \u201cquarantine,\u201d derived from the Italian word for 40 (quaranta).\n18 Thereafter, other global infectious disease outbreaks, such as the cholera epidemic during the mid-1800s, provoked multiple international treaties and conventions to develop world standards to prevent the spread of disease across borders.19 However, it was not until the World Health Organization (WHO) promulgated the International Sanitary Regulations (ISR) in 1951 that such international standards were developed. The ISR, renamed the International Health Regulations, were revised and updated in May 2005 to address emerging public health threats.18., 19. The overall goal of the revised IHR is to provide maximum security against the international spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with international travel and trade.19 Among other things, the IHR provide world standards for ship and port sanitation, surveillance, and response for infectious diseases that can have a serious public health impact globally.19 Under the IHR, international ports and conveyance operators are required to take measures to ensure delivery of safe food or water, appropriate waste disposal, and vector control. In addition, the WHO Guide to Ship Sanitation (referenced in the IHR) provides specific health requirements for ship construction and operation, and for sanitary measures on ships. It highlights the importance of applying control measures to reduce public health risks on ships. Recently, these guidelines have been revised with a systematic review of documented outbreaks and diseases of public health significance aboard ships during the last three decades.20\n",

CDC defines AGE as three or more episodes of loose stool within a 24-hour period, or vomiting plus one or more episodes of loose stool, fever, muscle aches, bloody stool, or headache. An epidemiologic and environmental investigation may be prompted if the cruise ship reports unusual cases, or at least 3% of the passenger or crew report symptoms of AGE. VSP posts summaries of recent and previous (since 1995) gastrointestinal outbreaks on its Web site.

Ships are inspected for food and water sanitation, disinfection of spas and pools, personal hygiene and practices of employees, pest control, general cleanliness, the physical condition of the ship, surveillance for acute gastrointestinal disease, and other factors. A score of at least 86 (out of 100) is necessary for a ship to pass inspection. Up-to-date sanitation inspection scores of cruise ships are available on the VSP Web site and are published monthly in the \u201cSummary of Inspections of International Cruise Ships\u201d (Green Sheet).

More serious problems (such as myocardial infarction, respiratory distress, or cerebrovascular accidents) may require emergency evacuation to a fully staffed and equipped shore-side hospital after the patient is stabilized in the ship's medical facility.26 Accordingly, one should view a ship's medical facility as an infirmary or sickbay and not a full-service hospital.",

Once symptoms do develop, physicians may not suspect or confirm the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease nor associate it with cruise travel. Furthermore, even if a diagnosis is made, fewer than an estimated 10% of Legionnaires' disease cases in the United States are reported to local or state public health departments, although reporting is legally required.9 Upon case detection, public health investigators face several challenges in pinpointing the origin of travel-related Legionnaire' disease. Passengers on a particular cruise ship may have been exposed to multiple pathogen reservoirs, such as hotel showers, during port stops, as well as before and after cruise travel. Moreover, firm linkage to a source requires isolation of the pathogen both from the suspected environment and from clinical specimens, which may no longer be available at the time of the public health investigation.30\n",

Since then approximately 50 incidents involving about 200 cases were documented as of 2000.20 In about 70% of these outbreaks, the ship's infectious source was not determined or reported. The most commonly established causes of the outbreaks included contamination of ship's water supply, air conditioning system, or spa pool.20., 30. The largest documented culture-confirmed cruise ship outbreak of Legionnaires' disease occurred in 1994. It involved a total of 50 passengers during nine separate sailings of the same ship.9 Illness due to infection through bacteria-laden aerosols generated by the spas was associated with immersion in, and spending time around, the whirlpool. The risk increased by 64% for every hour spent in the spa water and 35% for every hour spent around the spa. The same strain of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from the sand filters of the whirlpool spas and a clinical respiratory specimen, pointing to inadequate bromination of the ships' three whirlpool spas as the cause for the outbreak. No cases were discovered in the crew, most likely due to their lack of exposure to the spas and younger age. This outbreak was detected 3 months after it began, when a New Jersey physician notified the state health department that three hospitalized patients with atypical pneumonia had been on the same cruise ship, which highlights the delay in detection of cruise-associated Legionnaires' disease.9 In another, smaller, outbreak, three cases of Legionnaires' disease were detected on two separate voyages of one ship in the autumn of 1995 and 1996. A hot water supply contaminated with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was found to be the outbreak source.31\n",

Some of these passengers also participated in overland tours.33 Tour operators and returning travelers alerted public health officials about the increased risks of acquiring ARI and pneumonia. Reviews of cruise ship passenger medical logs revealed ARI rates two to three times the 1997 rate of 5.3 visits per 1,000 passengers. This led to intense public health surveillance at multiple sites, including local hospitals, clinics, and cruise ship infirmaries. The surveillance ultimately revealed 5,000 cases of ARI, including 2,864 influenza\u2013like illness (ARI and fever of 100\u00b0 F or 37.8\u00b0 C or self-reported fever) and 171 cases of pneumonia. Most cases were among tourists and tourism workers (representing 18 and 37 countries, respectively), and only a small percentage were among Alaska residents. The isolated influenza A (H3N2) virus was the predominant circulating strain during the previous influenza season in the United States and Canada. It was unclear if the virus was still circulating among Alaskan residents and infected susceptible tourists or if infected tourists from the southern hemisphere (where the influenza season was ongoing) introduced this outbreak. Despite control measures, the outbreak lasted for 5 months due to a large weekly influx of susceptible overland and cruise ship tourists, ending only after the completion of tourism season. During the summer of 1999, an increase in ARI again occurred among tourists to the same region, prompting year-long surveillance.33 It also resulted in CDC's releasing the \u201cPreliminary guidelines on prevention, surveillance and control of influenza\u2013like illness (ILI) aboard cruise ships,\u201d compliance with which is voluntary for cruise lines.34\n",

In one outbreak during the summer of 2000, a Baltic cruise from the United Kingdom carrying passengers primarily from the United States had a much greater ARI attack rate among the crew (13% of 506) than the passengers (4% of 1,311).32., 35. Confirmed cases initially tested negative by rapid influenza testing (designed to detect A and B strains). The final diagnosis of influenza B was made by viral culture and immunofluorescence antibody of nasopharyngeal specimens. The index case was found to be a passenger who boarded the ship ill and remained in her cabin except for meals, passing on the infection to both her cabin and dining room stewards. Other crew members became infected by socializing or sharing cabins with the ill crew members, leading to the higher attack rate among crew than among passengers.35 This outbreak demonstrates the potential for person-to-person transmission of the influenza virus between passenger and crew. It also highlights the importance of appropriate isolation of ill persons and use of infection control precautions in preventing and controlling outbreaks, especially in crowded and confined settings such as cruise ships.",

Moreover, NoV are more resistant to chlorination than enteric bacteria and require higher levels of residual chlorine levels to prevent outbreaks.20 Other organisms that may cause waterborne GI outbreaks on cruise ships include Salmonella spp, Shigella sp, Cryptoporidium sp, and Giardia intestinalis. However, the specific cause cannot be identified in about one quarter of outbreaks.38 An outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea was associated with consumption of unbottled water, ice, and raw sliced fruit and vegetables aboard a cruise to the Galapagos Islands in 1994. Deficiencies in the ship's water handling and chlorination may have contributed to this outbreak of chronic diarrhea among passengers.40\n",

Inadequate temperature control of foods during this time can allow bacteria to grow. For example, in a S. aureus gastrointestinal illness outbreak aboard a Caribbean cruise ship, the suspected food was pastries, which were believed to have been contaminated during preparation. The same strain of S. aureus was detected from several food handlers and cases. Additionally, possible subsequent storage of the pastries at warm temperatures led to the production of enterotoxin, which caused illness among passengers.42 To reduce the risk of foodborne outbreaks cruise ships should ensure that food (especially shellfish) is thoroughly cooked, use pasteurized eggs, cater shore-side meals rather than using local sources, and exclude ill food handlers from food preparation.37\n",

If the percentage affected reaches 2% or more (outbreak likely or in progress) or there are six or more cases in one day, the captain is notified immediately and a decision may be made to escalate sanitation measures. Some examples of CDC-recommended NoV control measures include strict application of food and water sanitation measures; prompt disinfection with suitable disinfectants (e.g. chlorine solutions at concentrations of at least 1,000 ppm, phenol-based compounds, and accelerated hydrogen peroxide products); and isolation of ill passengers and crew for 48\u201372 hours after clinical recovery.45 Typically, the captain gives printed instructions to the passengers about illness prevention and control measures to be followed. These may include hand washing tips and a recommendation to seek medical care in the ship's infirmary as soon as GI symptoms develop. This letter also lists sanitation measures being undertaken by the ship, such as frequent cleaning of common areas, staterooms, elevator buttons, and hand rails.47\n",

Most often, such illnesses are traced to crew originating from countries in which immunity to routine VPD may be low.18 For example, susceptibility rates to rubella range from 4% to 68% in countries without a routine rubella vaccination program.48 The densely populated environment of cruise ships and the social interactions among crew and passengers allow for person-to-person spread of VPD among susceptible persons. In the United States an estimated 10% of women of childbearing age are susceptible to rubella.48 Of the pregnant women infected during the first 11 weeks of gestation, up to 90% of the infants will be born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS); the rate of CRS for infants born to women infected during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is 20%.49 Hence, women of childbearing age (i.e. 15-44 years), particularly pregnant women,48 along with other potentially susceptible groups of cruise travelers, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed, and children, need to check their immune status to routine VPD before travel.",

Of these sixteen crew members with an acute rubella infection, 50% were asymptomatic. An additional 7% of tested crew members proved to be susceptible to infection. Approximately 85% of 366 crew members were born outside the United States (representing more than 50 different countries), and 75% had no known immunity to rubella or had a negative antibody result on testing. Although no cases appeared among passengers in either outbreak, a survey of 3,643 passengers on one of the cruise ships found 75% to be U.S.-born, 33% to be of childbearing age, and 0.8% to be pregnant (half being in the first trimester), demonstrating the susceptibility of passengers to rubella. This outbreak was controlled by administration of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to crew members without documented immunity to rubella, active surveillance aboard the cruise ship for new rubella cases, and notification of all passengers at risk for exposure to rubella on the cruise ship.48 Another outbreak of varicella aboard a cruise ship in 1998 revealed similar trends in VPD risk among the crew, with 13% being infected or susceptible, most being foreign-born (especially from tropical countries).18 Persons are immune once they develop varicella, so the risk of infection decreases with age. In tropical areas, however, varicella typically occurs among adults, who are at risk of developing more severe disease. Special attention should be given to immunocompromised persons among susceptibles, and they who should receive specific varicella-zoster immune globulin (or intravenous immune globulin if specific IG is not available) within 96 hours of exposure.50\n",

Modern cruise ships are also constructed with roll stabilizers, which minimize turbulence. Even so, sea sickness is a common concern of many cruise travelers and is among the top four reasons for infirmary visits.27 Some passengers are sensitive to motion and require pharmacologic prevention and treatment with antihistamines, antimuscarinic, or antidopaminergic agents.14 Alternative medicines may also help some individuals (for more information on sea sickness, see chapter 44). The association between passenger cabin location and risk of motion sickness is controversial, but common perception persists that central cabins are the least sea sickness-inducing. A recent study found that cabin location is only associated with the risk of sea sickness when the passenger is seated or standing. Passengers who are able to readily lie down can reduce their risk for motion sickness irrespective of their cabin location.52\n",

Pre-travel health preparations and knowledge of available medical care aboard cruise ships are important for cruise travelers, especially given that approximately one third are senior citizens who may have chronic illnesses or who may be at greater risk for some infectious diseases.6 Because medical facilities aboard cruise ships are designed to provide basic emergency medical care, travelers should be encouraged to consult their health insurance provider regarding extra coverage while away from their home country and for medical evacuation.14., 24. Health-care providers can contribute to a healthy cruise environment through rapid detection, diagnosis, and public health reporting of cruise-related communicable diseases in returned ill travelers. 10\n",
