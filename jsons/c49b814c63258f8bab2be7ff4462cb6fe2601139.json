The outbreak in early December 2019 in the Hubei province of the People's Republic of China has spread worldwide. As of May 2020, the overall number of patients confirmed to have the disease has exceeded 3,580,000 in more than 180 countries, the number of people infected is probably much higher, and more than 250,000 people have died from This pandemic continues to challenge medical systems worldwide in many aspects, including sharp increases in demands for hospital beds and critical shortages in medical equipment, while many healthcare workers have themselves been infected. Thus, the capacity for immediate clinical decisions and effective usage of healthcare resources is crucial. The most validated diagnosis test for COVID-19, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is currently in shortage in developing countries. This contributes to increased infection rates and delays critical preventive measures.",

Our framework provides a ranking of the most important features that were used to define the decisions (Figure 1 .b). Presenting with fever and cough were key features in predicting contraction of the disease. As expected, close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual was also an important feature, thus corroborating the disease's high transmissibility 10 . In addition, 'male' gender was revealed as a predictor of a positive result by the model, concurring with the observed gender bias [11] [12] [13] .",

Gradient boosting is widely considered state of the art in predicting tabular data 15 and is used by many successful algorithms in the field of machine learning 16 . As suggested by previous studies 17 , missing values were inherently handled by the gradient-boosting predictor 18 . We used the gradientboosting predictor trained with the LightGBM 19 Python package. To identify the principal features driving model prediction, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values 20 were calculated. These values are suited for complex models such as artificial neural networks and gradient-boosting machines 21 . Originating in game theory, SHAP values partition the prediction result of every sample into the contribution of each constituent feature value. This is done by estimating the difference between models with subsets of the feature space. By averaging across samples, SHAP values estimate the contribution of each feature to overall model predictions.",
