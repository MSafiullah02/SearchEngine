Using molecular tests including real time PCR and viral genome sequencing, PI3V strains could be separated into PI3V types, including PI3V A, PI3V B, and PI3V C. Isolates from cattle with bovine respiratory disease clinical signs and commercial vaccines in the U.S. with MLV PI3V were typed using these molecular tests. All the MLV vaccine strains tested were PI3V A. In most cases PI3V field strains from calves receiving MLV vaccines were types heterologous to the vaccine type A. Also antigenic differences were noted as PI3V C strains had lower antibody levels than PI3V A in serums from cattle receiving MLV PI3V A vaccines. This study further demonstrates there is genetic variability of U.S. PI3V strains and also antigenic variability. In addition, isolates from cattle with BRD signs and receiving MLV vaccines may have heterologous types to the vaccines, and molecular tests should be performed to differentiate field from vaccine strains. Potentially the efficacy of current PI3V A vaccines should be evaluated with other types such a PI3V B and PI3V C.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bovine respiratory diseases (BRD) have etiologies of viruses, bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp. (Fulton,2008 (Fulton, , 2009 ) Viruses included in BRD, either singly or in combination include bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), parainfluenza \u22123 virus (PI3V), bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine coronaviruses (BoCV) (Fulton,2008 (Fulton, , 2009 Fulton et al., 2011; Fulton et al., 2013; Fulton et al., 2016) . The bovine PI3V is a RNA virus in the genus Respirovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae (Chanock et al., 2001) . In North America both killed/inactivated and modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are used for control of these viruses (Compendium of Veterinary Products, 2010) . Clinicians seeking information on potential causative agents/etiologies often submit samples from cattle such as nasal swabs or blood samples from affected cattle and tissues from necropsy samples to the diagnostic laboratories. Samples may be tested by \"traditional tests\" including virus isolation for infectious virus or more often \"modern tests\", molecular tests including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in some cases, sequencing of the agent's genome (Fulton et al., 2016; Fulton and Confer, 2012) . Interpretation of such results is important for clinicians and the diagnostic laboratory. Viruses may appear to be similar based on the test used such as infectious viruses from cultures or these from the molecular tests that are homologous based on the product produced using primers. Also there is the dilemma of whether the virus identified is a field virus or a vaccine strain. A recent study utilized samples from cattle with BRD signs after processing with MLV vaccines administered (Fulton et al., 2016) . In that study there were isolates of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V that utilized sequencing of the viral genome and found either field strains or vaccine strains. Thus it is important to be able to differentiate viral isolates of field or vaccine origin. Several PI3V strains in the U.S. have been examined using viral sequencing with three types identified, PI3VA, PI3VB, and PI3V C. (Neill et al., 2015) The study purposes were three-fold: (1) characterize PI3V strains in available commercial vaccines by molecular tests, (2) compare PI3V strains from field cases of BRD by molecular tests and to determine if the strain was related to MLV strains, and (3) using serums from calves given MLV vaccines containing PI3VA strains to determine antigenic variation when serums were tested in viral neutralization test with PI3VA and two PI3V C strains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 104, "text": "(Fulton,2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 105, "end": 120, "text": "(Fulton, , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 363, "end": 375, "text": "(Fulton,2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 376, "end": 391, "text": "(Fulton, , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 392, "end": 412, "text": "Fulton et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 413, "end": 433, "text": "Fulton et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 434, "end": 454, "text": "Fulton et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 544, "end": 566, "text": "(Chanock et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 687, "end": 728, "text": "(Compendium of Veterinary Products, 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1213, "text": "(Fulton et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1238, "text": "Fulton and Confer, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1751, "text": "(Fulton et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2152, "text": "(Neill et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Viruses from cattle in this study included 22 viruses from 4 different studies (Table 1 ) dated from 1999 until 2014.
