Her most famous and most representative work is Silent Spring, published in 1962, which has already become the \u201cmilestone canonical work\u201d in contemporary ecological theory, and is also a canonical work of literary ecological critique. The writing of this book took a good many years in the process of which Carson lived through two great misfortunes: the first is her mother\u2019s passing; Carson never married and depended on her mother for her whole life, so her mother\u2019s passing was a heavy blow to her; the other time was Carson herself suffering from cancer. Two years following the publication of Silent Spring, in 1964, she passed away. This book not only manifests the passion for literature and depth of thought that she had, but also exhibits her rigor and positivistic spirit as a scientist. She painstakingly compiled large amounts of evidence, and after putting it through large amounts of survey studies, the book fiercely attacks the damage wreaked on the earth and atmosphere by pesticides and points the sharp point of her pen directly at the production of DDT. The publication of this book gravely offended the interests of the agricultural capitalist and the groups of scientists related to them, who criticized, ganged up against her and even launched fatal blows. The New York Times used a lively and directive title when discussing her case\u2014\u201cThe Silent Spring is Now Noisy Summer.\u201d Carson obstinately braved the pressure, made sure the publication of the book went smoothly, and it became one of the highest grossing books in America and the whole world at the time. It is precisely because of this book that America passed an environmental protection law. The publication of the book also genuinely became a turning point for ecological problems. \u201cShe deployed explicit, richly poetic and easy to understand language to concretely describe how pesticides damage the American resources of air, soil and water and how the damage incurred from the abuse of pesticides greatly outweighed the benefits they were bringing about\u201d, \u201cshe wakened people to ecological problems with the touch of her own pen\u201d, and many Americans saw Carson as a brave hero.1\n(2)\nAn Allegorical Revelation\u2014Humanity Endangers Herself\n\n",

            "text": "The first chapter of Rachel Carson\u2019s The Silent Spring imagines the condition of a town in the central America suffering from the destructive effects of pesticides. What accompanied the modernization of American agriculture was initially the widespread use of such modern agricultural technologies as fertilizers and pesticides, which means putting tons of pressure on the ecological environment. This town that Carson envisions would hear a cacophony of birds singing the glory of blooming diversity, a cacophony that dramatically dims down to a dead silence, the reason being that the overuse of such insecticides as DDT wreak havoc on the fields and soil and harm insects and all species of birds, which is effectively people harming themselves. This town is a reflection of countless U.S. towns during the 60\u2019s; it is an extremely illustrative allegory of industrial civilization leading humanity to harm itself. Humanity not only destroys nature, but harms humanity itself, \u201cthis means that malignant disease will strike two out of three families.\u201d2\n(3)\nThe Merciless Denunciation of an Era Dominated by Industries Trying to Make Money at Whatever Cost\n\n",

In Silent Spring, Carson gives a vivid interpretation of this conclusion from her own perspective. In the book, she exposes the reason causing the silent spring to be the overuse of modern agrochemicals and specifically the pesticide DDT, but the ultimate reason behind this phenomenon is the domination of capitalist industries, which seek the maximization of profit. She states, \u201cit is an age dominated by industry, in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged.\u201d3 She traces this situation further back to the capitalist pursuit of money developing since the industrial revolution, which is precisely the essence of capital Marx spoke of as the pursuit of the proliferation of capital, but she elevates this problem to the level of public health. She states, \u201cAs the tide of chemicals born of the industrial age has arisen to engulf our environment, a drastic change has come about in the nature of the most serious public health problems.\u201d4\n(4)\nRevealing the Law of the Balance of Nature\n\n",

            "text": "Rachel Carson was a marine biologist, who skillfully applied basic biological theories in her book, specifically the theory of the balance of nature, and advocated the thought of the food chain. The famous English historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee also advocated the theory of the food chain, stating that humanity\u2019s destruction of the natural environment commits the crime of \u201cmatricide.\u201d Carson states, \u201cIn some quarters today it is fashionable to dismiss the balance of nature\u201d, \u201cbut it is still there: a complex, precise, and highly integrated system of relationships between living things which cannot safely be ignored any more than the law of gravity can be defied with impunity by a man perched on the edge of a cliff. The balance of nature is not a status quo; it is fluid, ever shifting, in a constant state of adjustment. Man, too, is part of this balance. Sometimes the balance is in his favor; sometimes\u2014and all too often through his own activities\u2014it is shifted to his disadvantage\u201d.5 Carson also states about the chains of life that, \u201cfrom the small-as-dust green cells of the drifting plant plankton, through the minute water fleas to the fishes that strain plankton from the water and are in turn eaten by other fishes or by birds, mink, raccoons\u2014in an endless cyclic transfer of materials from life to life.\u201d6 The theory of chains is extremely important in contemporary biological thought. Every entity and biological being on earth, including man, is a link in this chain of life, and enjoys the rights that it deserves to enjoy in this chain, and should also take on the responsibility that the chain gives it whether consciously or unconsciously\u2014which is to maintain the stability and balance of the chain of life. Today there is a saying that the chain of life may still be restored after being destroyed, but actually the chain of life is irrecoverable after it is destroyed. After an ecological milieu is destroyed and then repaired, the ecological chain in it has actually already transformed and is no longer the same ecological chain that existed prior to the destruction. After primeval forests have been felled, the ecological chain is destroyed, after which planting trees may bring about another new chain, but the original chain is no longer recoverable; After the Huang He river is polluted, we can treat it, but the chain of life in it is already altered, and the Huang He river changes into another Huang He river after treatment. The facts prove that ecological conditions are singular and unrepeatable. So, we have to protect and try to maintain balance in the chain of life.(5)\nThe Critique of Humanity\u2019s Arrogant Fantasy of \u201cControlling Nature\u201d\n\n",

In the last century we said \u201cto hell with Nature, the earth can produce as much as man wills,\u201d which exudes from great confidence in controlling nature, but a confidence which is an ignorance, a self-aggrandizing fantasy. The human species in fact cannot possibly have complete control of nature, and on the contrary can only respect nature and follow nature. Marx never respected controlling nature, \u201cbut respected shaping nature in accordance with the laws of beauty\u201d, which include two aspects: one is the needs intrinsic to species, another is the needs intrinsic to human being. In satisfying the needs of human beings, we also must respect the needs of species, which is to speak of respecting nature, not controlling it. When Carson speaks of man controlling nature, she states, \u201cThe control of nature is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.\u201d7 Using the pesticide DDT to control the growth of so-called pests leads to the \u201csilent spring,\u201d which is but humanity reaping what it has sown. Similar to this, China once got caught up in the movement of \u201celiminating the four pests,\u201d when sparrows were thought to be one of the so-called \u201cfour pests,\u201d and the Chinese people wiped out the sparrows through many methods from spraying chemicals to trapping them with nets, practices which were likewise extremely infantile, resulting in the destruction of ecological chains and the balance of nature.(6)\nWarning that Humanity is Standing Where Two Roads Diverge\n\n",

This club has a group of world renown physicists, biologists, mathematicians, economists, sociologists, philosophers and prospectors. Its founder is the Italian Aurelio Peccei (1908\u20131984). Peccei was born of a progressive cultural family from Torino, a doctorate in economics, a famous Italian industrialist, social activist and researcher of global problems. He once worked at Fiat Automobiles, dedicated himself to the anti-fascist leftist movement during WWII, and became a member of the Italian resistance movement. In 1944 he was thrown in prison for a year. After the war he continued to work at Fiat Automobiles, and resided in China for eight years. After 1957, with the support of Italian investors, government officials and industrialists, he founded an international non-profit engineering and economic consultation company that he presided over as CEO, and it later developed into Europe\u2019s largest and most vital economic consultation company. In the middle of the enterprise, Peccei felt accomplished enough to step back from the company, and put his focus on the human predicament, hoping to find a method to alter humanity\u2019s course leading to disaster. In April of 1968, under his initiative, more than 30 specialists, including scientists, educationalists, economists and entrepreneurs from ten countries, including Italy, Sweden, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Great Britain, attended a meeting at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, where they discussed present and future predicaments. This was the first international meeting where the problem of the human predicament was discussed. The Club of Rome was born on the ground of this meeting. So far, the Club of Rome\u2019s nearly 100 representatives coming from 40 countries engage in cross-disciplinary innovative research on such global problems as the population, resources, food, energy and environment in current societies, and wrote a series of synthetic investigative reports: The Chasm Ahead, The Limits to Growth, Mankind at the Turning Point, Road Maps to the Future, Dialogue on Wealth and Welfare, etc.",

The book was published in 1972, which is precisely the year in which The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was adopted, marking the point at which humanity stepped into the era of ecological civilization, when ecological problems became global problems. The Limits to Growth explains the limits of growth with scientifically vetted data and reasoning, and reveals to humankind for the first time the severe consequences of unlimited growth on a limited earth, sending shockwaves throughout the globe. The revised edition was published in 1992, and the 3rd edition in 2004. The 3rd edition once again sounds the alarm on the issue of growth with 30 years of additional data to back it up. Just as the author says, this book is not simply a book making predictions about humanity\u2019s future, but is rather a book that makes simulations of all kinds of scenarios and consequences on the basis of known data and hypothetical situations, a book that provides humanity with the correct path to choose, and also a book of warning to the world.

The agricultural revolution was humanity\u2019s successful coping with a shortage of wildlife species.11 Due to population growth, the decrease of wild animals in the hunting economy could no longer satisfy people\u2019s needs, so humanity settled down and became sedentary, choosing crop growing and the agricultural economy instead.

Roads, railways, factories and chimneys littered the horizon, and the city also continuously inflated in size. Such changes are also a complicated enjoyment\u201d.13 This is shows that because of rapid population growth, traditional agriculture could no longer sustain the life of such populations, thereby bringing about new shortages, which is the main reason behind the birth of the industrial revolution. But, \u201cthe success of the industrial revolution just like the hunting and agricultural revolutions before it ultimately brought about its own shortages as well,\u201d14 and such shortages include the aspects of \u201csource\u201d and \u201csink.\u201d \u201cSource\u201d refers to resources; \u201csink\u201d refers to the earth\u2019s carrying capacity for pollution.

That is build material systems that can recycle waste or render waste harmless. In June of 2008 China gradually began halting the manufacture and usage of non-decomposable plastic bags, which is an exceptionally good policy measure.\u2463Technological designs reduce waste emissions and waste products to the absolute minimum, and the whole of society decides not to produce waste emissions and waste products that technology and nature cannot treat. In developed nations, the sorting of trash is very strict, differently colored plastic bags hold different trash, organic materials are separated from inorganic materials, and so is the decomposable from the non-decomposable, and trashed that is mixed together must be taken back;\u2464Maintaining the diversity of ecosystems. The ancient adage goes: \u201cwhat is harmonious grows with one another, what is homogeneous does not transfer.\u201d Any species on earth is a member of the ecological chain, no matter how extremely unimportant humanity might view them, every species has its right to survive, and plays its own unique function in the chain of life;\u2465The reason for living and the reason for wanting to make your own living conditions improve no longer involve the increase of material enjoyment.16 Of course, we want to guarantee necessary material satisfaction.

In ancient agricultural societies, science and technology was not yet developed, and people did not understand natural phenomena. They therefore believed that many mysterious phenomena arose due to the gods or ghosts, thereby \u201cenchanting\u201d nature. In some parts of China\u2019s rural areas in the past, snakes, foxes, and other animals are often sacred because of their color, and cannot be killed, as doing so would bring about disaster. In industrial society, science and technology have developed, and people\u2019s ability to know the nature has been greatly enhanced. As a result, nature\u2019s mystery began to fade away. During the Enlightenment, Francis Bacon proposed that \u201cknowledge is power\u201d and believed that knowledge can change everything, which is a heroic declaration of human respect for knowledge and the self. Rene Descartes put forward the idea that \u201cI think so I am\u201d, and believed that reason is above all else, and therefore that the rational subject is above all else. They estimated too highly of experimental science as the representative of scientific forces, and believed that the power of relying on technology can do everything. They therefore put forward the idea of the \u201cDisenchantment of the World\u201d. According to research, it is the famous German sociologist Max Weber who first proposed the idea of the \u201cDisenchantment of the World.\u201d In fact, the \u201cdisenchantment\u201d had already begun during the Enlightenment. Immanuel Kant\u2019s famous saying: \u201cMan made legislation for nature \u201c, clearly demonstrates this view position. Weber put forward this statement when introducing one of Christianity\u2019s reformed sects, \u201cCalvinism\u201d in in Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism in 1904 to 1905. He said, \u201cThis great historical process of religious development - the magic is eliminated of the World, where it reached its logical end.\u201d26 The Elimination of the World is also translated as \u201cthe loss of the world\u2019s magic.\u201d Weber specifically interpreted it as, \u201crejecting the magic of the Eucharist as a path to salvation.\u201d27 \u201cThe magic of the Eucharist\u201d means that Jesus will give his disciples wine and bread that will symbolize his own blood and flesh during the last supper so that they can be rescued after his martyrdom. Refusing to take part in this religious practice is also \u201cdisenchantment.\u201d The translator interprets it as \u201ca very important aspect of Weber\u2019s more extensive rationalization process, where he sums up his philosophy of history.\u201d28 In other words, \u201cdisenchantment\u201d is an important aspect of Weber\u2019s rational process, not only confined to religion.",

            "text": "According to the New York Times report, China Handan Iron and Steel Plant introduced Germany\u2019s Ruhr iron and steel making equipment from the late 1990s, improving steel production by leaps and bounds. Now, China\u2019s steel production has more than that of Germany, Japan, and the United States combined steel production. However, with the transfer of this equipment, environmental pollution has also been transferred. Ruhr was a high pollution area. If you wear a white shirt in the morning, it will turn gray at night. But now the Ruhr people in Germany are in exchange for clear water and blue sky. In contrast, Handan in China has a serious problem of environmental pollution. The residents living in the west side of Handan City have been living in dusty smoke, containing carcinogenic substances in the gas.36 A village in central Shandong is also the so-called \u201ccancer village,\u201d as the incidence of esophageal cancer is extremely high because the village is close to the Dawen River polluted by the nearby city of industrial and mining enterprises. Now, young adults and children have been transferred out of the village. Only the elderly stay there and helplessly wait for fate to come. At present, there are some \u201ccancer villages\u201d similar to this in China. This situation shows that serious environmental problems not only directly threaten the success of the country\u2019s modernization, but also is a direct threat to people\u2019s lives and health.(3)\nThe problems of resources and environment directly contradict the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the development policy of a \u201cpeople-oriented\u201d in China\n\n",

            "text": "In recent years, China\u2019s average annual growth is about 10%, but if you get rid of the economic losses caused by environmental pollution, the growth rate is very small. Practice has proved that the path of \u201cpost-pollution control\u201d is impractical because it will pay a much higher price. It will not only pay an economic price, but also will pay the price of people\u2019s health, good life, and even lives. This is contradictory to the \u201cpeople-oriented\u201d approach in China\u2019s scientific development. The United Nations stipulates that environmental rights are also a human right, and everyone has the right to live with dignity in a beautiful environment.",

            "text": "Imagine if there is no clean drinking water: we would all go crazy to grab a small amount of mineral water or rush around for a bucket of water. Would people in this way live with dignity? When we are closed upstairs by \u201cSARS\u201d virus, only to get a little life supplies in the window through the basket, will we be living with dignity? In this case, can we take the kind of arrogant, conqueror\u2019s attitude to nature, or can we be moderately fearful of nature? That is to say, when a quantity increases in proportion to its existing one, it grows exponentially. For example, depositing $100 in a bank will increase to $107 in the first year at a 7% interest rate. The growth rate in the second year is 7% of $107, or $7.49. By the tenth year, it will grow to $196.72, almost doubled. If you put $100 in a jar, and invest $7 per year, then after 10 years, it will be $149. This is linear growth. By the end of the fifth decade, the money in the bank account will be 6.5 times more than in the jar, almost $2,500. According to the authors of Limits to Growth, the population growth of underdeveloped cities has grown exponentially over the past half century, and the population has doubled in 19 years. The population of industrialized areas has grown linearly and is relatively flat. For the exponential growth of the population, there is a real problem before us. That is to say, under a certain ecological footprint, is there limit to the growth of human needs and land ratio, and where is this limit?",
