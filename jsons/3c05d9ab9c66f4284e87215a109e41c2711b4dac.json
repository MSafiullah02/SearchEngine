Starting with Louis Pasteur's discovery of the link between germs and disease, microorganisms were of interest mainly because they were considered to be causes of infectious diseases. In the last 100 years, numerous microorganisms were identifi ed as the causative agents of important human diseases, and bacteriologists, microbiologists, and immunologists are continuing to focus on bacteria as pathogens. This approach has led to enormous insights in the battle between the invading harmful microbes and the host, as well as enabled the development of effi cient strategies to fi ght infections. However, most bacteria are not harmful to plants or animals, and many of them are benefi cial, playing a key ecological role. Louise Taylor and colleagues from the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh have used the published literature to compile a list of organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, together with the available information on whether they are zoonotic, whether they are regarded as emerging, and on their transmission routes and epidemiologies. Their estimate indicates that only 200 of the millions of bacteria that interact with humans are pathogenic (Taylor et al. 2001 ) .",

            "text": "Why did it take so long for animals to arrive? The answer that this question usually invokes is that levels of oxygen in solution in ancient oceans, which had been increasing gradually, suddenly breached a threshold that could sustain the greater demands (motility, etc.) of animal life. Since the great oxygenation event, the activities of cyanobacteria had brought about steady increases in atmospheric O 2 , so that by the late Vendian and early Cambrian, atmospheric O 2 was probably near presentday levels. The Ediacaran animals were restricted to those patches of shallow water that were relatively well oxygenated; the deeper oceans were in transition from being predominantly anoxic and sulfi de-rich to being anoxic but iron-rich and possibly also rich in dissolved organic carbon, but still hostile to all but microbial life. Reaching a critical atmospheric oxygen level is often nominated as the likely trigger for the emergence of complex multicellular animals, because metazoans have a relatively high demand for oxygen; higher O 2 levels may also have liberated the ancient ecosystem from nitrogen starvation imposed by the sulfi de-rich and anoxic state of the oceans. The idea of a critical level of oxygen triggering animal evolution is, however, not unanimously subscribed to. An attractive alternative idea is that early animals themselves were the agents of change-that by greatly increasing ventilation of the oceans, early animals actually caused most of the observed geochemical perturbations observed during the Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic transition, rather than the geochemical events enabling/\"causing\" animal evolution. Zooplankton grazing may have selected for large phytoplankton that were export prone (i.e., upon demise, prone to sinking to the benthos and thus exporting production from the photic zone), effectively transforming what was a cyanobacteria-dominated and anoxic water column that was probably also turbid and stratifi ed into a mixed and aerated system dominated by eukaryotic algae. By causing mixing of the oceans, animals started to transform the environment and thus not only to alter the distribution of microbes but also to open new niches for microbial colonization. Animals, therefore, have thus been major agents of change since their early origins.",

Interestingly, metagenomic analysis of sequence reads of the genome of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica ( Fig. 2 .5 ) is consistent with existence of a dominant proteobacterial symbiont. From a randomly chosen representative subset of unassembled, fi ltered reads (120,000 out of 217,873 total), 7720 (6.4 %) were putatively assigned to the bacterial domain of life, and a very small number were assigned to archaea (161, 0.1 %) (Srivastava et al. 2010 ) . The majority of reads map to alpha and gammaproteobacteria. The fraction of reads assigned to alphaproteobacteria exceeds the fraction of all sequenced genomes that belong to alphaproteobacteria. Likewise, we fi nd an excess of reads assigned to Planctomycetes relative to the number of genomes sequenced; however, the total number of putatively bacterial reads assigned to Planctomycetes is small (2.8 %). Thus, metagenomic analysis of sequence reads is consistent with existence of a dominant proteobacterial symbiont.

Similar to observations in Hydra and Nematostella , the Symbiodinium genome provided evidence for the close association with alphaproteobacterium. The largest scaffold in the assembly appears to form a circular DNA of 3.8 Mbp. The GC content of the scaffold was 53 %, compared to 44 % in S. minutum . In addition, no expressed sequence tag (EST) data were mapped onto the putative bacterial genome fragment, indicating that the source of this DNA was quite different from Symbiodinium .

The bacterial and phage genes are located in distinct scaffolds, which can be separated from those corresponding to the DNA of the target organism, N. vectensis , by several criteria, including the nucleotide composition and the provenance of neighboring genes; the spurious character of introns annotated in these genes; and a rich and apparently randomly drawn repertoire of predicted protein functions, which include several molecular roles considered to be prokaryote specifi c.

Two distinct bacterial genera are clear leaders in high-sequence similarity of these bacterium-like proteins. They are Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium (80-85 % and 85-95 % median identity of amino acids to their nearest database homologs, respectively), separated by many hundreds of millions of years of bacterial evolution. Thus, a considerable fraction of N. vectensis genes in fact are bacterium-like genes annotated as belonging to N. vectensis but encode proteins of bacterial origin.

CRISPR stands for \"clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats\" and CAS for \"CRISPR-associated genes.\" In 1987, Ishino and his colleagues discovered an unusual structure of repetitive DNA downstream of the E. coli inhibitor of apoptosis ( iap ) gene, consisting of invariant direct repeats and variable spacing elements. In 2002, Jansen and colleagues coined the term CRISPR and reported that CRISPSs colocalized with specifi c cas genes. CRISPS/CAS systems are exclusively found in prokaryotes and are present in approximately half of all bacteria and almost all archaea (Grissa et al. 2007 ). Analysis of bacterial and archaeal genome sequences and the associated viral and plasmid sequences led to the realization that CRSIPS spacers, which resemble fragments of foreign genetic elements, were derived from invading genomes (Barrangou et al. 2007 ). This breakthrough, together with the detection of CRISPR locus transcripts with defi ned length of one or more spacer repeat units, and the predicted nucleic acid-related activities for many of the cas genes, led the team of computational biologists around Eugene Koonin at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in Bethesda, to propose that CRIPS/CAS neutralizes invaders via a mechanism reminiscent of RNA interference (Makarova et al. 2011 ). Soon after, Rodolphe Barrangou, Philippe Horvath, and colleagues provided the fi rst experimental evidence that the CRIPS/CAS system of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus functions as an inheritable, adaptive prokaryotic immune system conferring phage resistance. The bacterial genome integrates a sequence of the viral genome, called a spacer, upon infection; that sequence later serves as a guide for destroying any matching DNA, so that subsequent viral infections are fended off (Horvath and Barrangou 2010 ). As pointed out by Artamonova and Mushegian ( 2013 ) , many of the bacteriumlike proteins annotated by the Nematostella vectensis genome project have functions that are relevant to the biology of bacteria but have never been reported in eukaryotes. Interestingly, among the examples are proteins with high similarity to Cas1 (one of the CRISPR-associated proteins participating in a prokaryote-specifi c immunity system), bacterial transcription regulators and bacterial-type protein kinases, the pilin glycosylation protein PglD, OmpA/MotB domain proteins that operate in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and the aforementioned cyclopeptide biosynthesis enzymes. Even if the genes encoding these proteins were once horizontally transferred to the N. vectensis genome, it would be highly unusual for a eukaryote to maintain all of them, in an essentially unmodifi ed form, to perform a set of functions that are without precedent in metazoa.",

Far from these genes being biologically irrelevant sample contamination, their presence in the genome database indicates that, similar to the cases of other marine Anthozoa (Williams et al. 2007 ) and the completely sequenced freshwater hydrozoan H. magnipapillata , the body of the starlet sea anemone is in fact a holobiont, i.e., a consortium of a metazoan animal and bacteria closely associated with it throughout most or all of the host life cycle (see also Sect. 6.4 ).",

Under artifi cial selection in the laboratory, normally unicellular bacteria can achieve a kind of multicellularity by \"learning\" to adhere to each other. And some bacterial lineages even have achieved a degree of cellular differentiation; for example, when Nostoc , a cyanobacterium found in a variety of environmental niches (Fig. 2.6 ), is grown under N-limitation, nitrogenfi xing heterocysts develop at regular intervals along a chain of \"normal\" vegetative cells, allowing the oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fi xing and oxygenic photosynthesis reactions to be partitioned between functionally differentiated cells. Despite billions of years of opportunity, this, however, seems to be as far as bacteria have explored the opportunities provided by multicellularity. Among eukaryotes, a similar level of complexity has independently been achieved many times. For example, volvocine algae have apparently evolved their version of multicellularity (involving the differentiation of reproductive and ciliated cells) several times independently. Note that the mechanism involved intrinsically limits the volvocine algae this very basic level of multicellularity. As the nearest relatives of metazoans, choanofl agellates are of particular interest; most choanofl agellates are unicellular, but some are not. In the case of Salpingoeca , while the mechanism of multicellularity is an elegant refl ection of selective forces, the molecules and processes involved are irrelevant in terms of understanding animal origins. In response to the abundance of prey bacteria, the unicellular form of Salpingoeca forms aggregates that can better exploit the food source; the mechanism involves recognition by the choanofl agellate of a specifi c sulfolipid in the cell wall of a restricted group of bacteria.",

One possibility is that the nature of bacterial evolution itself may serve to effectively limit them to this basic level of multicellularity. Cellular specialization demands integration of cells, with greater integration being required for higher levels of multicellularity. However, integration requires cooperation of cells, which means that each cell must be able to \"trust\" its neighbors-they must operate in fundamentally similar ways, otherwise, for example, effective communication between cells is not possible, and neighbors could \"cheat\" rather than cooperate in the multicellular endeavor. Multicellularity therefore is contingent on genetic homogeneity-cells can only effectively communicate with (\"trust\") its neighbors which have essentially the same genotype. Genetic homogeneity is a hallmark of multicellularity, but is probably quite rare in prokaryotes.",

One corollary of this line of thinking is that the evolution of more complex forms multicellularity should require the evolution of increasingly sophisticated ways of protecting the genome from invading foreign DNA. Both animals and plants do have formidable molecular arsenals that can be deployed against invading foreign DNA, which accounts for the rarity of lateral gene transfers (LGTs) into their genomes.

The interpretation of Precambrian fossils is at least equally contentious, with alarming frequency, new discovered early Precambrian fossils or new interpretations of known materials are claimed to either push back the origins of the Metazoa or confi rm deep Precambrian origins, the papers (often in highimpact journals) only to be refuted shortly thereafter. Here, we take the conservative view that the Metazoa arose at or close to the Ediacaran/Cambrian boundary and that all or most of the Precambrian fossils represent something else entirely. Before the late Ediacaran, animal life was scarce, simple, and restricted in distribution, but then suddenly the entire game changed-animals were abundant, complex, and more widely distributed and began to have a much greater impact on the biosphere.",

The origins of many of these and other genes specifi c to animal processes such as cell adhesion, and social control of cell proliferation, death, and differentiation can be traced to genomic events (gene birth, subfamily expansions, intron gain/loss, and so on) that occurred in the lineage that led to the metazoan ancestor, after animals diverged from their unicellular \"cousins.\" In addition to possessing a wide range of metazoan-specifi c genes, the Amphimedon draft genome is missing some genes that are conserved in other animals, indicative of gene origin and expansion in eumetazoans after their divergence from the demosponge lineage and/or gene loss in Amphimedon . While the sponge and cnidarian data pushed back the evolutionary origins of developmental signaling pathways and many transcription factors to common metazoan (or eumetazoan) ancestores (Shinzato et al. 2011 ) , it is now clear that many \"animal-specifi c\" genes have older origins yet and are not restricted to animals. Clear evidence for more widespread occurrence of \"animal-specifi c\" genes came from sequencing of transcripts and then the genome of the choanofl agellate, Monosiga brevicollis . Choanofl agellates promise to provide insights into the origins of multicellularity because they sometimes form colonies in which cells maintain their individuality but can also share small molecules. Nicole King's lab at UC Berkeley has shown that choanofl agellate genomes do encode a number of \"animal-specifi c\" genes, including receptor tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and immunoglobulins (Alegado and King 2014 ; Alegado et al. 2012 ) . Disappointingly, sequencing the genome of the \"multicellular\" choanofl agellate, Salpingoeca rosetta ( Fig. 2.7 ) , added very little to understanding metazoan origins; it seems that choanofl agellates have independently invented a mechanism (or mechanisms) for \"multicellularity.\" Thus, although they tell us more about how multicellularity can be achieved, choanofl agellates cannot inform us about how the metazoan ancestor made this transition.",

This distribution gave rise to the idea that the biosynthetic pathway was acquired in ascidians by \"horizontal transfer\" (= LGT). However, if the genes were acquired by LGT, this happened a long time ago-much longer ago than is usually implied when LGT is invoked-because cellulose synthase genes from ascidians that diverged deep in the Cambrian are very similar.
