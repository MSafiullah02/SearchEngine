            "text": "The branching factor, \u03ba, is a measure of heterogeneity of a network. It captures a notion of the average degree of the vertex reached by following an edge from a vertex and, therefore, measures the rate of spreading across the network. Many key concepts in mathematical epidemiology depend on the branching factor, for example, the basic reproduction number R 0 . The latter is generally defined as the number of secondary infections expected in the early stages of an epidemic by a single infective in a population of susceptibles (Anderson and May, 1991; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000) . In network-based susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, R 0 can be shown to equal \u03b8(\u03ba \u2212 1)/(\u03b8 + \u03b3), where \u03b8 and \u03b3 are infection and recovery rates, respectively (Andersson (1997) ). The importance of R 0 in the study of epidemics arises from its role in so-called threshold theorems, which state under which conditions the presence of an infective individual in a population will lead to an epidemic (Whittle, 1955) . It is evident that knowing the value of \u03ba is vital for effective control responses in the early stages of an epidemic. In addition, various thresholds in epidemiological and percolation theory rely on the branching factor. In the discussion section, we provide details on how our estimation of the branching factor can be extended to those statistics.",

Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to take into account individual-level behavioral heterogeneities and shifts. Network-based approaches have been explored for investigating disease outbreaks in human (Eubank et al. (2004) ), livestock (Kao et al. (2006) ) and wildlife (Craft et al. (2009)) populations. Moreover, contact network information generally is available only up to some level of error -also known as, network noise. For example, there is often measurement error associated with network constructions, where, by 'measurement error' we will mean true edges being observed as non-edges, and vice versa. Such edge noise occurs in self-reported contact networks where participants may not perceive and recall all contacts correctly (Smieszek et al. (2012) ). It can also be found in sensor-based contact networks where automated proximity loggers are used to report frequency and duration of contacts. (Drewe et al. (2012) ). We investigate how network noise impacts on the observed value of \u03ba and, therefore, on our understanding of infectious diseases spreading.",

Given adequate data, estimates of the model parameters, such as \u03b8 and \u03b3, can be produced with accompanying standard errors. Methods for this purpose are reviewed in Andersson and Britton (2012, Chapter 9-12) and Becker and Britton (1999) . Many studies have explored the effects of uncertainty in parameter estimation on basic epidemic quantities. For instance, there have been efforts to quantify uncertainty in R 0 around recent high profile emergent events, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Chowell et al. (2004a) ), the new influenza A (H1N1) (White et al. (2009)) , and Ebola ( Chowell et al. (2004b) ). But, to our best knowledge, there has been little attention to date given towards uncertainty analysis of \u03ba and relevant quantities in network-based epidemic models. Exceptions include real-time estimation of R 0 at an early stage of an outbreak by considering the heterogeneity in contact networks (Davoudi et al. (2012) ), and measurability of R 0 in highly detailed sociodemographic data with the clustered contact structure assumed of the population (Liu et al. (2018) ).",

            "text": "As remarked above, there appears to be little in the way of a formal and general treatment of the error propagation problem in network-based epidemic models. However, there are several areas in which the probabilistic or statistical treatment of uncertainty enters prominently in network analysis. Model-based approaches include statistical methodology for predicting network topology or attributes with models that explicitly include a component for network noise (Jiang et al. (2011) , Jiang and Kolaczyk (2012) ), the 'denoising' of noisy networks (Chatterjee et al. (2015) ), and the adaptation of methods for vertex classification using networks observed with errors (Priebe et al. (2015) ). The other common approach to network noise is based on a 'signal plus noise' perspective. For example, Balachandran et al. (2017) introduced a simple model for noisy networks that, conditional on some true underlying network, assumed we observed a version of that network corrupted by an independent random noise that effectively flips the status of (non)edges. Later, Chang et al. (2018) developed method-of-moments estimators for the underlying rates of error when replicates of the observed network are available. In a somewhat different direction, uncertainty in network construction due to sampling has also been studied in some depth. See, for example, Kolaczyk (2009, Chapter 5) or Ahmed et al. (2014) for surveys of this area. However, in this setting, the uncertainty arises only from sampling-the subset of vertices and edges obtained through sampling are typically assumed to be observed without error.",

If the replicates necessary for our approach are unavailable in a given setting, a Bayesian approach is a natural alternative. For Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 MME Bootstrap example, posterior-predictive checks for goodness-of-fit based on examination of a handful of network summary measures is common practice (e.g., Bloem-Reddy and Orbanz (2018)). Note, however, that the Bayesian approach requires careful modeling of the generative process underlying G and typically does not distinguish between signal and noise components. Our analysis is conditional on G, and hence does not require that G be modeled. It is effectively a 'signal plus noise' model, with the signal taken to be fixed but unknown. Related work has been done in the context of graphon modeling, with the goal of estimating network motif frequencies (e.g., Latouche and Robin (2016) ). However, again, one typically does not distinguish between signal and noise components in this setting. Additionally, we note that the problem of practical graphon estimation itself is still a developing area of research. Our work here sets the stage for extensions to various thresholds and statistics which depend on the branching factor. Recall that these include the percolation threshold 1/(\u03ba\u22121), the epidemic threshold 1/(\u03ba\u22121), and the immunization threshold 1 \u2212 1/(\u03bb\u03ba), where \u03bb is the spreading rate (Pastor-Satorras et al. (2015)). Replacing \u03ba with\u03ba, we obtain asymptotically unbiased estimators for the corresponding thresholds. The asymptotic distributions can be derived from the delta method. In addition, the total branching factor of the network is important for epidemic spreading and immunization strategy in multiplex networks (e.g., Buono et al. (2014) ).",
