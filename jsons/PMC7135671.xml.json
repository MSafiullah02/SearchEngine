Hospitals and other health care centers lie at the center of a community's response to an emergency and are a natural focus for efforts to develop and update emergency protocols. Regulatory agencies at the local, state, and national levels have initiated standards to ensure hospitals are capable of handling a surge in patient load in the case of an emergency. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Participation Agreement and The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations require that hospitals have comprehensive emergency management plans, including provisions to have adequate staff to handle increased patient loads during a disaster (1). Although additional responsibilities have been assigned to hospitals, little supplemental funding has been allocated to see these requirements to completion 1, 2. In conjunction with the decline in staff-to-patient ratios, decreased compensation, and increased costs, many hospitals do not have the staff or resources to plan an effective response to a major emergency 1, 3, 4.",

Recent disasters have shown that the public views hospitals as not only sources of medical care, but also as centralized sources of community support and assistance 5, 6. This perception of hospitals as rallying points during an emergency generates expectations that cannot be ignored. Research has indicated that community members are likely to gather at hospitals in search of food and water, family and friends, information regarding the emergency, shelter, or electricity 2, 5, 6, 7. In addition to meeting immediate medical needs of the community, hospital fulfillment of these nonmedical expectations provides reassurance to the public that one of the fundamental institutions within society is still functional.",

The potential mismatch between perceived public utilization of the hospital and actual utilization could lead to the overcrowding of hospitals and the diversion of staff members from medical care to crowd management far beyond current expectations of most hospital emergency planners. The incongruities between the public's expectations and reality need to be examined, so that hospital and community emergency management plans can be revised to address these issues. The purposes of this study are to identify the public's perceptions of hospital responsibilities to those presenting without medical injury or illness during a disaster, and delineate factors associated with higher public expectations.",

Lastly, demographic questions assessed participants' age, race, sex, relationship to the patient, utilization of the ED, visits to a primary care provider, and number of hospitalizations. A group of 10 U.S. disaster preparedness researchers provided feedback on content validity. The content validity index (CVI) was computed for each item (8). No items had a CVI <0.80, so none were deleted. Items were revised based on feedback from the CVI panel. The final survey contained 15 questions plus demographic items. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a 10-person panel of representative subjects. The final survey was considered exempt by the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board.",

Data from the paper surveys were entered into the database. Five percent of surveys were secondarily checked for data entry accuracy by the first author. Surveys with extensive incomplete data (\u226570%) were excluded from analyses. An overall expectations score was calculated by assigning 1 point for each resource/service that individuals expected the hospital to provide during a disaster (i.e., if they marked that they strongly agreed or agreed somewhat that an item/service should be provided by the hospital). The highest possible expectation score was 9 (i.e., 1 point for each of the 9 items). Descriptive statistics were computed for each question and used to describe individuals' expectations of hospital responsibility during a disaster to those coming to the hospital without a medical problem or to those accompanying someone with a medical issue. Linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher expectation scores. Nonsignificant variables, such as income, hospital location, and sex, were not included in the final model; only the final model is reported. \u03c72 tests were used to compare perceived expectation agreement rates (agree vs. not agree) when comparing response by race (white vs. non-white).",

Participants were asked to report how strongly they agreed or disagreed that each resource or service should be provided by a hospital to an individual who arrives at the hospital without a medical problem and without accompanying someone seeking/needing medical care. The most frequently expected resource or service as reported by participants consisted of an event-specific vaccine (such as a pandemic vaccine), medication refill or replacement, and food or water (Table 2\n). The least frequently expected resource or service as reported by participants consisted of nonemergency transportation to or from the hospital and shelter lasting 3 or more days (Table 2). Participants' perceived expectations were found to vary. Determinants of perceived hospital expectations included those younger or older than 36\u221245 years of age, race, and having a family member who has a medical condition that requires ongoing electricity (such as a home ventilator or home oxygen) (Table 3\n). However, not all perceived expectations varied by participants' race.

This study indicates that there is a high expectation by the public that the local hospital will be the provider of these resources, a finding that needs to be examined over a broader population. By understanding the plans of the public, community organizations can develop and educate the public about alternate sites of relief centers to allow the hospital to focus on treating patients while allowing the community to address these legitimate public needs.Article Summary\n1. Why is this topic important?Continuity of patient care can only be sustained during disasters by being able to fully plan for public expectations. Large numbers of the public presenting for resources can quickly overwhelm an unprepared hospital.\n2. What does this study attempt to show?This study attempts to define the scope of what the public expects hospitals to provide during disasters for those who do not have an emergent medical injury or illness.\n3. What are the key findings?The public has high expectations of what hospitals are responsible for providing to the public during disasters. These expectations are likely beyond the capabilities of most hospitals to provide.\n4. How is patient care impacted?By understanding public expectations, hospital planners can better prepare their hospital to divert or meet these expectations during disasters, thus allowing the hospital to focus on providing emergency medical care.\n\n",
