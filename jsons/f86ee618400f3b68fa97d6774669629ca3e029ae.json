In this era of precision medicine, Big Data, translational science, patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness research, formal advanced training needs to be provided to PhD students (Henly et al., 2015) . There is also a growing demand for multiple disciplinary research teams to observe problems from different perspectives, develop more comprehensive research hypotheses, and solve complex problems more effectively (Choi & Pak, 2006) . These recent trends towards producing applied science, i.e. research involving multiple disciplines is becoming increasingly appealing for funding agencies. The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) has been encouraging the integration of genetic or other biomarkers, and informatics in Nursing Science for the past 20 years (National Institute of Nursing Research, n.d.-a; National Institute of Nursing Research, n.d.-b). But, are PhD programs in Nursing preparing nurse scholars who can function adequately at the cutting-edge of science? To our knowledge, as of 2015, there has been only one study on Nursing PhD programs in the U.S. revealing that curricula do not sufficiently cover emerging areas in the sciences (Wyman & Henly, 2015) . The amalgamation of new research methods in nursing studies, as per the NINR recommendations, will get students up to par for collaboration with other disciplines.",

Measurement in health services-oriented research and interactive digital media may also be examined.

We shed light on the specifics related to translational research methods spanning from preclinical to population studies. The management of various data sources such as blood, tissue or imaging in biomarker and genetic research was discussed. Analysis of Big data and the use of bioinformatics in nursing research were also introduced. Since the textbook alone was not sufficient to cover all the content of this course, we selected recent publications of expert faculty members and, when possible, we invited the authors to deliver and discuss the content. This allowed the students to hear about different research trajectories and experiences (challenges along the way), and programs of research. Several researchers from nursing and applied health disciplines were invited to explain these topics based on expertise. Coordinating such a course is demanding for the lead instructors as they work on ensuring robust integration of the different aspects of the course and students' needs.",

Students valued course faculty sharing their real-life experience on measurement challenges that needed to be addressed in the conduct of research studies. Finally, students shared that having guest speakers from other disciplines provided for interesting and newer perspectives on research possibilities. In further developing measurement coursework, additional emphasis could be placed on data produced by technologic enhancements in research. For example, considerations for the use of advanced statistical approaches to handle repeated measurements, and computational tools to facilitate recognition of meaningful patterns in data may be elaborated upon.",

PhD programs must be wellpositioned to produce investigators who conceive, develop, and implement innovative initiatives in interdisciplinary contexts. Faculty need to be abreast of developments and to ensure the delivery of a curriculum that is at the forefront of science. In addressing a core aspect of the curriculum, it is essential to develop novel measurement coursework. Training students on measurement issues relevant to contemporary phenomena encourages them on unconventional thinking and interdisciplinary collaborations, and enhances state-of-thescience nursing research. 2) Demonstrate ability to examine reliability, validity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of measurement instruments and predictive values of assays 3) Evaluate the use of tissue and blood markers as surrogate outcomes in clinical research 4) Examine measurement problems related to the analysis of Big Data 5) Explore aspects of precision medicine in nursing science 6) Describe the translational research spectrum and implications in nursing 7) Discuss implementation science as methodology for addressing the effectiveness of clinical interventions 8) Identify the components of instrument development",
