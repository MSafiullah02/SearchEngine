Depending on the rate of hydrolysis of their functional groups, polymers can be broadly categorized into two types: surfaceeroding and bulk-eroding [29, 91, 169] . Bulk-eroding polymers, such as PLG, readily allow permeation of water into the polymer matrix and degrade throughout the microsphere matrix. In contrast, surface-eroding polymers, such as polyanhydrides, are composed of relatively hydrophobic monomers linked by labile bonds. In this way, they are able to resist the penetration of water into the polymer bulk, while degrading quickly into oligomers and monomers at the polymer/water interface via hydrolysis [148] .",

In microspheres composed of surface-eroding polymers, drug is released primarily at the surface as the polymer breaks down around it. Erosion of such polymers usually proceeds at a constant velocity [66] . If the drug of interest is homogeneously dispersed throughout a microsphere, the largest rate of release will occur at the beginning. As time proceeds, the surface area of the sphere and the release rate decrease asymptotically.",

As one might expect, an increase in molecular weight decreases diffusivity and therefore drug release rate [2, 95, 109, 118, 191] . In addition, a major mechanism for release of many drugs is diffusion through water-filled pores, formed as polymer degradation generates soluble monomers and oligomers that can diffuse out of the particle. These small products are formed more quickly upon degradation of lower molecular weight polymers. The decrease in release rates with increasing polymer molecular weight appears to hold for small molecules, peptides, and proteins [25, 123] . However, molecular weight typically has little effect on release rates from surface-eroding polyanhydride microspheres [69, 167] .",

Increasing concentrations of PVA decreased the initial burst of protein and the overall release rates. Jain et al. encapsulated myoglobin in PLG microspheres in the presence of a stabilizer, mannitol [77] . They report that mannitol increased the release rate and the final amount of drug released by increasing the initial porosity of the PLG matrix, leading to faster formation of the pore network within the sphere due to polymer erosion.",

In addition, water penetration into smaller particles may be quicker due to the shorter distance from the surface to the center of the particle. Also, while the decrease in surface area with particle size may lead to decreased rate of erosion of poorly water-permeable polymers like polyanhydrides, because surface area-to-volume ratio increases with decreasing particle size, drug release rates (per mass of polymer) will be faster for smaller polyanhydride microspheres.",

In recent years, much work has focused on developing microsphere-based, single-administration, vaccine delivery vehicles [44, 45, 149, 158] using a variety of materials including hydroxypropyl cellulose/PLG [101] , poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) [160] , PLA [141] , chitosan [31] , and collagen [74] , though the majority have been fabricated with PLG [7, 44, 47, 158, 162] . Maintenance of antigen bioactivity has been problematic due to contact of the proteins with organic solvents and the hydrophobic polymer, and the use of strong physical forces to produce the microspheres [2, 36, 81] . To enhance vaccine stability, researchers have been focusing on several approaches, including the use of adjuvants to protect the protein antigens or by choosing different microsphere materials [125, 138, 139] .",

Two types of damage occur most often: (i) covalent or non-covalent intermolecular aggregation [34] and (ii) denaturation [51, 60] . Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of damage [153] .

For example, Perez-Rodriguez et al. very recently reported that co-dissolving PEG (M w 5,000) and maltose with \u03b1-chymotrypsin in the primary emulsion greatly reduced protein aggregation and inactivation [163] . In a similar study, Castellanos et al. used PEG to enhance the stability of \u03b3-chymotrypsin encapsulated in PLG microspheres formed by a solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) emulsion process [35] . They reported that normal encapsulation procedures with protein lyophilized from buffer or a trehalose solution caused 30% protein aggregation and 50% loss in activity. Co-lyophilizing the protein with PEG prior to encapsulation reduced the activity loss to only 8%, but the protein still aggregated during encapsulation. By using PEG as an emulsifier in the secondary o/w emulsion, the resulting microspheres were free of protein aggregation and the enzyme completely maintained its activity upon extraction from the particles. Similar stabilization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [35] and BSA [1] was achieved with the same technique, suggesting that this may be a general approach for protein stabilization. Finally, Jiang and Schwendeman reported that upon blending of 20-30 wt% PEG in PLA microspheres encapsulating BSA, protein aggregation was avoided and in vitro protein release was sustained for 29 days [79] .",

A major barrier to development of gene-based pharmaceuticals is safe and efficient DNA delivery. Much research has focused on development of gene delivery vectors including viruses [177] , liposomes [55] , and polymers [127] . However, parenteral administration of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) leads to gene expression [28, 188] , and controlled release of pDNA from polymeric matrices [26, 54, 116, 130, 155] , microparticles [73, 116, 121, 171] and nanoparticles [48, 75, 119] has been reported recently. In particular, encapsulation and controlled release of pDNA from biodegradable microspheres may provide a number of advantages including protection from nuclease degradation, access to alternative routes of administration (e.g., nasal, pulmonary, oral, and mucosal), passive targeting to professional antigen-presenting cells [73, 115] , and prolonged gene expression [116] .",

Plasmid DNA is particularly susceptible to damage by physical forces, especially the shear forces employed in most microsphere fabrication processes [106] . In addition, loss of structural integrity can result from exposure to acidic environments [171, 180, 182] . Ando et al. devised a novel emulsion-solvent extraction/evaporation method for DNAloaded microsphere encapsulation that prevents shear-induced damage of the plasmid [6] . In this method, the primary w/o emulsion, comprising the aqueous DNA solution and the polymer/solvent continuous phase, is formed by sonication and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The emulsion is allowed to warm slowly until reaching a temperature at which the organic phase melts, but the aqueous phase remains frozen. The primary emulsion-actually a suspension of ice particles-is then homogenized in water to form the microspheres. Because the DNA is entrapped in the frozen droplets, the plasmid does not experience the shear forces employed in homogenization. In microspheres prepared by the optimal procedure, 89% of the DNA retained its native conformation compared to only 39% using the conventional process.",

In these processes, a solution containing the polymer (and possibly the drug to be encapsulated) is emulsified in a non-solvent phase (the continuous phase) containing a stabilizer. The emulsion can be prepared with any of a variety of physical methods including homogenization and sonication. The components are chosen such that the solvent is slightly soluble in the non-solvent. For example, to produce microspheres of PLG or polyanhydrides, common solvents are methylene chloride and ethyl acetate used in conjunction with an aqueous continuous phase containing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a stabilizer [49] . After emulsification, the solvent is extracted into the continuous phase and allowed to evaporate. At the same time, the non-solvent may penetrate into the polymerrich droplets. Due to loss of solvent, the dispersed phase is enriched in polymer until the droplets \"harden\" to become particles. The microspheres may then be filtered, washed, and lyophilized.",

Because these methods are inherently batch operations, scale up of the processes is difficult and large-scale production can be costly. Another critical problem is that size distributions of particles are generally reproducible but non-uniform. Standard deviations of the distribution equal to 50% of the average size are not uncommon. Since the size of the spheres directly affects the drug release rate and syringability, it is important that size distributions be relatively narrow. In addition, as described above the presence of organic solvents and aqueous-organic interfaces may have adverse effects on encapsulated drugs [62, 147] -decreasing or even eliminating bioactivity. Organic solvents also may be very difficult to remove completely. Since many of the commonly used organic solvents (e.g., methylene chloride) are toxic, the concentration of residual solvent in the microsphere must be tightly regulated.",

The minimum size obtained, however, was only \u223c500 \u00b5m, and they concluded that \"it is not possible to obtain small microbeads having a narrow size distribution.\" Amsden later reported production of uniform microspheres by extruding a polymer solution through a nozzle and into a stabilizing solution flowing perpendicular to the point of injection [3] . The PLG solution droplets exiting the nozzle are drawn into the PVA solution in a periodic fashion. The rate at which the droplets are removed from the nozzle, and therefore-under constant polymer flow rate-the size of the microspheres, are determined by properties of the stabilizing solution (density and viscosity), the diameter of the nozzle, and the interfacial tension between the polymer solution and the needle tip. Amsden reported PLG microspheres with diameters ranging from 67.7 to 295 \u00b5m. However, the size distributions varied widely, with standard deviations typically 10-30% of the average size (the minimum standard deviation was 5% of the average for 295-\u00b5m microspheres). Furthermore, formation of small particles may not be possible with this technique, as any further reduction of the particle size would apparently require smaller nozzles; as the nozzle size is decreased, shear forces at the orifice and the potential for clogging increase.",

The nozzle is vibrated by a piezoelectric transducer driven by a wave generator at a frequency tuned to match the flow rate and the desired drop size. The mechanical excitation launches an acoustic wave along the liquid jet generating periodic instabilities that, in turn, break the stream into a train of uniform droplets (Figure 2 .3A). With this apparatus alone, the minimum particle size achievable is approximately twice the nozzle opening. This approach represents an improvement over conventional ultrasonic nozzles as the acoustic wave intensity is lower and we can tightly control the match between the frequency and solution flow rate.",

In addition, fragile therapeutics such as proteins and DNA may be stabilized by generating a favorable environment in the core. Advanced drug release schedules such as delayed or pulsatile release, with the removal of drug \"burst,\" may be possible by selectively varying the shell material or especially thickness [103] [104] . For example, a surface-eroding polymer (e.g. polyanhydride) shell may be expected to protect a polyester core, and the encapsulated drug, for a prolonged time, the duration of which is governed by the shell thickness. However, efficient fabrication of such particles has not been previously reported to our knowledge. Finally, drugs could be released in tandem by selectively loading them into the core or shell phase thereby potentially enhancing drug efficacy [193] [194] .",

For example, variations of the common double-emulsion approach have also been used to prepare microcapsules by allowing the discontinuous phase of the primary emulsion to coalesce and form the core of the particle [50, 150, 172] . Such particles have shown an interesting pulsatile release profile that may be advantageous for vaccine delivery [150] . Important limitations of these approaches, however, are that the core and shell material must be immiscible and the microcapsule architecture is difficult to control; the core size and shell thickness depend strongly on the properties of the primary emulsion and the time over which the emulsion is allowed to coalesce.",

One of the first studies consisted of adding two separate polymers dropwise to an aqueous phase and controlling precipitation rates such that one polymer has ample time to spread on the other [96, 97, 99, 122, 132] . Another technique utilized the phase separation of PLG and PLL at certain concentrations [103] [104] . The radiosensitizer etanidazole was suspended as fine filaments (<20 \u00b5m) into the PLG phase and the two polymers were emulsified into each other forming a milky solution. Again, during the relatively prolonged extraction of solvent from these large, \u223c450-\u00b5m particles, the two polymers phase-separated, but some of each polymer still remained in both the core and shell phase. Etanidazole was entrapped primarily in the PLG core due to a higher affinity to the PLG phase. Most recently, a polyorthoester (POE) was encapsulated in a PLG shell [193] [194] . In these studies, the overall polymer concentration remained constant at 5% (wt polymer/vol DCM) but the POE:PLG polymer ratio was adjusted to produce double-wall microspheres. When POE accounted for 50%, 60%, and 70% of the polymer weight, core-shell particles with PLG shells were formed while microspheres with intermingled polymer phases were formed at all other ratios.",

First, the interfacial tension between the three phases (polymer 1, polymer 2, aqueous non-solvent) indicates which polymer will tend to spread on the other [133] [134] 173] . The spreading coefficient in these cases, therefore, is expected to be a function of the polymer chemistry, solvent type, and polymer concentration [193] [194] . Relying on these thermodynamically driven techniques to form microcapsules may necessitate extended solvent extraction times to allow the two polymer phases to come into intimate contact [96-100, 122, 132, 133] or phase separate [103] [104] and then form a core/shell arrangement before the polymer solutions precipitate. An extended solvent extraction time may have been achieved in the reviewed work by creating large particles, >100 \u00b5m (and thus large nascent polymer droplets), lowering polymer concentration, lowering the temperature of the non-solvent bath, or adding solvent to the extraction phase. Thus, the achievable architectures, types of drugs that can be encapsulated, shell thicknesses obtainable, and release kinetics achievable may be limited.",

            "text": "A process known as electrohydrodynamic (EHD) or electrostatic (ESS) spraying can be used to fabricate both micro-and nanospheres of polymeric materials. In this method charge is injected at a controlled rate (i.e., at a controlled current) into a polymer solution contained in a nozzle such that the surface of the solution meniscus at the nozzle opening becomes highly charged. The charged meniscus surface is thus under the electrical tension forces that push the meniscus surface away from the nozzle, opposing the surface tension force that tries to minimize the meniscus surface area (Figure 2.7) . The electrical forces increase with increasing charge injection, finally overcoming the surface tension force and ejecting the charged solution from the meniscus surface. The net result is that with an increase in the charge injection, there will be gradual reduction in the size of the drops that leave the nozzle. This so-called \"drip mode\" develops into a \"single-jet mode\" with further increase in the charge injection. The jet mode is invoked when the electrical tension forces at the charged meniscus surface are such that the charged solution is literally pulled away from the nozzle orifice as a thin jet, which in turn naturally breaks up into charged droplets due to the jet instability. As the charge injection is further increased, the \"single-jet mode\" develops into a \"multijet mode\" where more than one jet emanates from the charged meniscus surface at the nozzle opening. Since the electrical tension forces acting on the meniscus surface are a function of the surface charge density, the effect of increasing flow rate is similar to that of decreasing charge injection. Figure 2 .8 shows this sequence of FIGURE 2.8. FFESS sequence with increasing voltage: (A-D) Jet formation using 5% w/v solution of PLG (0.20 dL/g) in methylene chloride flowing at 1 mL/h as voltage increases from 0 to 7 kV. (E-H) Multi-jet mode spryaing of 5% w/v PLG (0.20 dL/g) in acetonitrile flowing at 1 mL/h as voltage increases from 4 to 9 kV. Charge injection was achieved using a sharpened tungsten needle encased by a glass capillary having a 300-\u00b5m orifice positioned \u223c1-2 cm above a ground plate. events that take place as the charging voltage (i.e., the charge injection) is increased, for a PLG solution. In the phenomena just described, generally known as EHD spraying, the typical flow rates used are necessarily very small. When fibers are produced as the final product, which is possible with polymeric solutions or material in molten state, the process is often referred to as electrospinning.",

Thus, the FFESS process allows one to produce sprays that are finer and more precisely controlled than those produced by conventional EHD techniques, which employ conducting hypodermic needles as the spray nozzle (Figure 2.7) . The main reason is that the sharp charge-injection electrode used in FFESS renders more control and stability, and higher charge injection (Kim, 1994 (Kim, & 1995 . For applications involving advanced drug delivery, the effects of the key parameters controlling the FFESS process, such as applied voltage, polymer solution flow-rate, and solvent properties (surface tension, viscosity, vapor pressure) have been qualitatively evaluated [19] . For example, using the FFESS system a wide variety of uniform micro-and nanoparticles of PLG have been created. (Figure 2.9 ). By discretely varying production parameters, subtle changes in deposited polymer morphology are realized potentially resulting in enhanced performance of a medical or biological device. FFESS technology thus provides a simple and robust technique for fabricating devices with a precisely defined nano-structure from a broad range of biocompatible polymeric materials.",

The data clearly show that release of model small-molecule drugs can be varied from typical diffusion-controlled profiles to slower, sigmoidal profiles as microsphere diameter is increased in the range of 10-100 \u00b5m. The data also show that drug release from mixtures of uniform microspheres corresponds to a weighted average of the release from individual uniform microspheres. As a result, it has been possible to choose appropriate mixtures to generate desired release rate profiles, in particular constant (i.e., zero-order) release. It is, therefore, concluded that microsphere mixtures with well-defined size distributions may provide a general methodology for controlling drug release rates [15, [17] [18] . ",

Because there is a transition from the concave downward to sigmoidal release profiles as sphere size increases, it appears that nearly linear release may be achieved at a certain size. For example, between 10-and 50-\u00b5m, a microsphere size may exist that would provide zeroorder piroxicam release over a 4-to 8-day duration (c.f. Figure 2 .10). Others have reported linear or near-linear release profiles achieved with microspheres of similar size, \u223c30-50 \u00b5m in diameter [21, 110, 189] . For example, Woo et al. formulated a leuprolide delivery system using PLA microspheres with an average diameter of 51.7 \u00b5m achieving near-linear peptide release for 135 days following a 15-day period of \"diffusion-controlled release\" [189] . This early phase of release may result from the portion of the microspheres in this formulation under \u223c35-\u00b5m, which would be expected to release drug more rapidly. Further, Bezemer et al. used a poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEG-PBT) block copolymer to test the effects of microsphere size on drug release [21] . They also discovered that decreasing the average microsphere size from 108 \u00b5m to 29 \u00b5m causes the release kinetics to change gradually from zero-order release to release controlled by Fickian diffusion.",

For example, Ravivarapu et al. mixed microspheres comprising 8.6-kD or 28.3-kD PLG encapsulating leuprolide acetate [144] . The low-molecular-weight polymer resulted in porous, quickly releasing microspheres while the high-molecular-weight formulation resulted in dense microspheres and produced a sigmoidal release profile. By mixing microspheres comprising the two polymers, release rates could be tailored, and the resulting profiles were linear combinations of those resulting from individual microspheres. Bezemer et al. produced linear lysozyme release over 25 days from PEG-PBT microspheres having a bimodal size distribution dominated by 50-\u00b5m and 110-\u00b5m particles (in essence a combination of two sizes) [21] . Finally, Narayani et al. combined gelatin microspheres of various size ranges producing zero-order release of methotrexate [128] . In general, however, zero-order release has been difficult to achieve with simple microsphere systems. Further, there is little generality, and unique systems are designed empirically for each drug.",

To investigate the generality of this hypothesis, we mixed uniform microspheres of different sizes to generate zero-order release of rhodamine and the clinically relevant NSAID, piroxicam. For example, multiple linear combinations of 10-, 50and 100-\u00b5m piroxicam-containing microspheres at various drug loadings were examined computationally to identify a combination resulting in linear drug release. Two possible formulations were found. The first formulation combined 10-\u00b5m/15% and 50-\u00b5m/15% microspheres in ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 wt:wt. This formulation resulted in slightly concave downward release profiles for the 3:1 and 1:1 ratios and a linear drug release profile for the 1:3 wt:wt mixture (Figure 2.11B) .",

We found that upon mixing uniform microsphere preparations, the resulting release profile is a massweighted average of the release profiles of the individual microspheres. This demonstrates that the microspheres release their payload independently; there is no interaction between the particles. In these experiments, the shapes of the rhodamine and piroxicam release profiles were such that it was possible to choose appropriate microsphere mixtures that provided zero-order release kinetics (Figure 2.11 ). However, it may not always be possible to generate a desired release profile from mixtures of only two microsphere sizes. Depending on the desired profile and the shape of the individual release curves, one may need to mix multiple microsphere samples or to fabricate complex microsphere size distributions. Because the PPF method provides a unique ability to generate predefined microsphere sizes [147] , this technology may lead to enhanced control of release rates.",

Clearly, the overall particle size and shell thickness are important parameters in modulating the drug release rates. In one study, PPF was used to fabricate double-walled microspheres of predefined uniform diameters of 40-60 \u00b5m exhibiting a PLG core and poly(l-lactide) (PL) shell of controllable thickness from approximately 2 to 10 \u00b5m [13] . In vitro release of piroxicam from uniform microspheres of pure PLG and PL is compared to release from double-walled microspheres exhibiting different PL shell thicknesses in Figure 2 .12. The benefit of utilizing a PL shell around the PLG core is threefold. First, the presence of the PL shell minimizes the initial drug \"burst\" so often associated with microparticle-based drug delivery systems. Secondly, by FIGURE 2.12 . In vitro release of piroxicam from PPF particles with drug-free PLL shells and PLG cores containing piroxicam. The legend shows the weight ratios of PLL:PLG. specifically controlling the mass ratio of PL:PLG and thus the resulting PL shell thickness, the release of piroxicam can be progressively modulated from biphasic (no shell) to zeroorder (thickest shell in Figure 2 .12). Lastly, the duration of piroxicam release was extended from one month to three months utilizing the same molecular weight PLG. The ability to specifically control double-walled microsphere shell thickness may provide a novel and precise approach to modulate drug release profiles.",

The initial burst of protein therapeutics has been attributed to their tendency to partition to the microsphere surface during the encapsulation process [61] . Multiple approaches have attempted to alleviate the burst by adding excipients to the polymer phase [80, 185] , utilizing novel polymers [70, 166, 168, 181, 195] , encapsulating particulate forms of the drugs [33] , or exchanging the non-solvent aqueous phase used in the fabrication process with non-polar oils or alcohols to reduce the affinity of the encapsulated drugs for the bulk phase [57, 174] . The burst is usually followed by a lag period where diffusion is limited and little release of the macromolecule occurs. The duration and flatness of this phase is determined by the polymer degradation kinetics, particle size, and microsphere porosity [10] . In addition, the drug size, charge, and any potential interactions of the drug with the polymer can influence the lag phase [30] .

The precision particle fabrication (PPF) technology described in Section 3 allowed the production of these monodisperse microspheres [12, 14] . Fluorescein-dextran (F-Dex) and sulforhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin (R-BSA) were encapsulated in PLG microspheres of three different sizes; 31, 44 and 80 \u00b5m and 34, 47 and 85 \u00b5m diameter for F-Dex and R-BSA, respectively (Figure 2.13) . Notably, the initial burst of drug often observed for release of hydrophilic macromolecules was not observed. At 28 hours, F-Dex-loaded microspheres had only released 1.2% of the total encapsulated drug for all three microsphere sizes while R-BSA-loaded microspheres released 1.9-4.8% depending on microsphere diameter. With the uniform microspheres, the duration of the slow release or \"lag\" phase varied with the microsphere diameter. In addition, the slow release phase for these formulations appears to be a diffusion-controlled process with rates that decrease with increasing sphere diameter. Plots of amount released versus the square root of time show that the diffusion-controlled phase lasts for days, depending on the microsphere size. Release from uniform microspheres showed only two phases: a lag and more rapid release. F-Dex release profiles were very distinctive for the three different sizes. The diffusioncontrolled lag period was followed by a sharp increase in release rate (Figure 2.13) . The time at which the release rate increased was strongly dependent upon but inversely proportional to microsphere size. Again, after the lag periods, release rates of molecules increased dramatically. Thus, uniform microspheres represent a new delivery system for therapeutic proteins and DNA and provide unprecedented control of delivery rates using simple injectable depot formulations.",

            "text": "The development of PPF technology has allowed the production of uniform microspheres and double-wall microspheres capable of efficiently encapsulating model drugs. Of primary importance was the ability of monodisperse microsphere formulations to eliminate initial drug burst while modulating the onset of steady drug release. Modified PPF technology has also been established as a single-step method for producing uniform polymeric microcapsules of controllable size and shell thickness. Monodisperse or precisely defined particle size distributions can be achieved while maintaining the desired polymeric shell thickness. Exact control of the volumetric flow-rates of the core and shell materials also allows the formation of particle populations exhibiting discretely or incrementally increasing shell thickness. Controlled release systems, especially those comprising biodegradable polymer microparticles, have been heavily studied and have even reached the clinic in several cases. However, notable limitations remain, especially in controlling delivery rates. Monodisperse PPF microspheres and core-shell microparticles offer advantages in reproducibility, control, and consistency that may provide valuable assistance in designing advanced drug delivery systems. The FFESS technique is capable of producing nanometer-scale solid particles as small as 10 nm or even smaller, and may be applicable to fabrication of nanocapsules. However, to achieve precise control of the particle size and reproducibly fabricate nanocapsules the technology needs to be further refined and developed.",

The fundamental physical processes underlying the PPF technology are schematically described in Figure 2.1. The method basically comprises spraying a polymer-containing solution through a nozzle with (i) acoustic excitation to produce uniform droplets (Figure 2.1A), and (ii) an annular, non-solvent carrier stream allowing further control of the droplet size (Figure 2.1B). Using the PPF technology we have fabricated uniform solid microspheres of a variety of polymers including poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG)",
