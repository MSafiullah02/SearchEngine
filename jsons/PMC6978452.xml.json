            "text": "Invasive candidiasis (IC) is one of the most common public health problems and is a major therapeutic challenge1. Increasing frequency of the pre-disposing risk factors has led to a remarkable 20-fold higher incidence of IC in just two decades2. However, unlike other fungal infections, IC is usually due to an endogenous candida overgrowth at mucosal surfaces (mucosal candidiasis)3. Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most common etiological agent of IC and is found in ~ 60% of clinical isolates of candidiasis4. In healthy individuals, C. albicans co-exists with the host in a harmless commensal (yeast) form without causing disease5. However, certain underlying conditions (e.g., major surgery, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, immunodeficiency diseases [AIDS, diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, etc.], or even premature birth) can cause candida to become pathogenic6. The pathogenesis of candida requires a switch from its commensal yeast form to a pathogenic fungal (hyphal) form5. The presence of hyphae enables candida to cause widespread damage to the underlying tissues. If the infection remains unchecked, candida can gain access to the host vasculature5. Once candida enters the bloodstream, it can spread throughout the body, causing life-threatening IC with a high mortality rate of 60%7. The current treatment with a limited set of available drugs leads to high drug-induced systemic toxicity and is associated with an increased emergence of anti-fungal-resistant candida species2. Therefore, despite the progress in medicine in general, IC is a leading cause of mycoses-related deaths8.",

            "text": "Immunosuppression is the leading cause of fatal, invasive candida infections. In healthy individuals, the ability of candida to alter its morphology is largely kept in check by an effective immune response9. The significance of an effective immune response in preventing IC, suggests that mimicking a natural immune response to candida may be an effective strategy to control its burden. In line with this, vaccination approaches against IC include PEV710 and NDV311, which have completed Phase I studies and are in further stages of immunogenicity and toxicity testing. PEV7 is a virosomal vaccine to protect women suffering from chronic vaginal yeast infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis or VVC). It consists of a truncated recombinant secreted aspartic protease 2 (Sap2), currently in clinical testing by Pevion BiotechAG10. NDV3 targets the recombinant N-terminal region of the hyphal protein agglutinin-like sequence three protein (rAls3p-N) and is being developed by NovaDigm Therapeutics12. Another vaccination approach from Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Efungumab) based on monoclonal antibody targeting the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) progressed through to a Phase III clinical trial but was abandoned in later stages of development due to safety concerns13. Finally, a prophylactic and therapeutic IgM-monoclonal antibody (MAb B6.1) by LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals that targeted (1 \u2192 2)-\u03b2-mannotriose also failed during development14. Thus, there are no FDA-approved candida vaccines for human use.",

            "text": "The failure of current vaccination approaches in eliciting an effective anti-candida immune response is attributed to a variety of reasons. One of the major drawbacks is candida\u2019s ability to evolve and ultimately escape the host immune surveillance15. Therefore, simultaneous targeting against multiple candida epitopes (multivalence) is expected to provide improved outcomes. So far, the multivalent-vaccine approach has not been adopted against C. albicans. Due to the complex nature of candida antigens and its ability to escape host-immune surveillance, a multi-epitope vaccine will likely be more beneficial in inducing a stronger and broader immune responses15,16. While most vaccines (to date) focused only on one antigen, our approach involves the simultaneous targeting of multiple candida antigens which are molecularly linked to form a single recombinant protein. Our strategy involves experimental validation of single peptide antigens whereby positive peptide epitopes can be combined to design a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine against C. albicans. The findings presented in the current study detail in silico epitope mapping and provide future directions for vaccine design against C. albicans.",

Next, each of these proteins fasta sequences was run on VaxiJen server, which utilizes an alignment-independent method based on principal amino acid properties18. Based on the published literature19, an antigenicity probability >0.9 was considered acceptable for subunit vaccines. The proteins were filtered based on their antigenicity score (>0.9) and subcellular localization (extracellular, plasma membrane or nuclear), using a web server (CELLO2GO20) for protein subcellular localization prediction, which shortlisted the number of proteins to 36 (Supplementary file 1, yellow and green highlight). Since our goal is to stop candida\u2019s switch to the pathogenic fungal form (without affecting its commensalism), we selected five of the 36 proteins (Als4p, Als3p, Fav2p, Als2p, Eap1p) (Supplementary file 1, green highlight) with known functions in hyphae formation. Further, we included three more hyphal proteins (Hyr1p, Hwp1p, Sap2p) (Supplementary file 1, blue highlight) from published studies21. The antigenicity score of these proteins was slightly below our cutoff (0.9), but due to their role in candida hyphae formation, we selected them for further development (Table 1).",

HLA class I alleles are sub-grouped into 12 superfamilies (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, B62). We screened each of the eight-hyphal proteins against each of the HLA class I superfamily (a total of 8 \u00d7 12 = 96 queries). The threshold values used were (HLAI binding [epitope identification] >0.75, weight on proteasomal C- terminal cleavage = 0.15; and weight on TAP [transport efficiency] = 0.05)22 (data not shown). For HLA class II epitope binding, we used the IEDB prediction server23, with low percentile rank and IC50 value as the selection criteria. Based on the spatial structure of the epitopes, the B-cell epitope structure can be categorized as continuous (linear) and discontinuous (conformational) epitopes24. For identification of linear B-cell epitopes, we used the BCPreds server25, while discontinuous B-cell epitope analyses were done using the IEDB prediction server23. B-cell epitopes were 20mer in length. Supplementary file 2 lists 240 selected HLA class I, HLA class II and B-cell epitopes in each of the 8 selected hyphal proteins. Next, to eliminate the possibility of overlapping epitopes we ran the 240 selected epitopes on the IEDB cluster analysis algorithm and filtered the epitopes for sequence identity (Supplementary file 2). This reduced the number of epitopes to a total of 214. Binding predictions for 10 conserved HLA class II T- cell epitopes (Table 2) and phenotype frequency of HLA allele type was analyzed using IEDB prediction server. IEDB recommended consensus percentile rank of the top 10% was taken for making selections (Supplementary file 3).",

For example, intra Tc and Th epitopes were joined by AAY and GPGPG linker, respectively (Fig. 1). We also incorporated a TLR4 agonist RS09 (APPHALS) at the N- terminal end of the final vaccine construct. Molecular linking of 18- single candida epitopes will facilitate better in vivo antigen processing and presentation. The choice of linker peptides and the adjuvant was based on the study published by Pandey et al.19. RS09 mimics lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a natural TLR4 ligand26. Thus, the presence of RS09 enables co-stimulation of TCRs, driving a more robust immune activation. Use of synthetic adjuvants (RS09) is a safer approach and considered an advancement over traditional vaccination approaches, such as using Freund\u2019s adjuvant27. The Tc epitope and adjuvant were joined by the EAAAK linker sequences (Fig. 1). Next, we performed the secondary structure analyses of the final mvPC vaccine construct using the RaptorX server28,29. Our initial analyses showed ~10% protein disorder. To further enhance protein stability, we identified the region of disorders and removed the peptide (GPGPGKTNEAGGSYDNVPVTLKKQG) (not shown in Fig. 1). Further rearrangements led to a final 349aa-long mvPC vaccine with 1% protein disorder (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The present study represents the first proteome-wide immunoinformatic approach to identify the immunodominant epitopes and design a multivalent subunit vaccine against C. albicans. Using web-based servers, we screened the entire candida proteome (consisting of 6030 proteins), to identify the most immunodominant candida antigens. Of note, our immunogenicity analyses focused on identifying epitopes in the hyphal proteins, which help candida adhere to and invade epithelial cells, resulting in severe damage to the host cells5. Thus, targeting hyphae will preserve candida\u2019s yeast form without affecting host-fungal commensalism. Eight antigenic proteins with known functions in hyphal formation (Als4p, Als3p, Fav2p, Als2p, Eap1p, Hyr1p, Hwp1p, Sap2p) were selected further for epitope mapping (Table 1). Immunogenicity testing led to the selection of 18 unique epitopes [10 CD4+ T- helper or Th (15mer), 7 B- cell (20mer) and 1 CD8+ T- cytotoxic or Tc (9mer)]. The rationale for selecting these epitopes lies in the significance of Th cells in recognizing HLA class II proteins and in turn activating both B- cells to secrete antibodies and activating Tc cells to kill infected target cells51. Antibody response to C. albicans is ideal to target carbohydrate moieties on the fungal cell wall, as well as some secreted proteins (secreted aspartyl proteinase or SAP52) and has been shown to be effective in providing resistance against IC53. Although Tc play a minor role in natural immunological defense against candida and have not been studied much, previous studies show that Tc are effective in controlling fungal infection post-vaccination54\u201356. Therefore, a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses is likely to confer an effective immune response against pathogenic candida. Conservancy analysis also show that the selected epitopes (in addition to the eight hyphal proteins), are also present in other candida proteins showing sequence homology (Sap1p, Sap 3p and Als1p, Table 2). Further, while designing the mvPC vaccine we have not only identified immunodominant epitopes in the antigenic proteins of the reference strain but also checked their conservancy across all known 22 strains of C. albicans whose proteome sequences are available in NCBI. Our selected antigens are in the highly-conserved regions of the candida proteome, offering protection against the 22 currently known candida strains. Selection of conserved candida epitopes also minimizes the chances of mutation in all the conserved regions simultaneously, limiting the emergence of new-resistant candida species. The selected epitopes also show conservation (a.k.a immunoprotection) with other pathogenic candida species (C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis). Lastly, selected epitopes show HLA binding affinity in all 27 reference alleles of HLA class II with a number of epitopes demonstrating binding ability with multiple HLA subtypes. The presence of RS09 (via activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway) is expected to boost anti-candida immune response by skewing Th response towards the Th17 subtype which plays a major role in mounting an immune response in clearance of pathogenic C. albicans57,58. RS09 has previously been shown to provide better adjuvanticity with fewer side effects in HIV-159.",
