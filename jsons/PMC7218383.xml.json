It seems that patients initially presenting digestive symptoms could have a longer interval from onset to admission and a worse prognosis, as compared to patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. This could be because if doctors rely only on pulmonary signs to raise the suspicion of CoViD-19, they may miss some cases showing, initially, only digestive symptoms. This could delay the diagnosis of the syndrome until the respiratory symptoms appear at an advanced stage [26]. However, at the moment, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited; therefore, further and more detailed investigations are needed before this information is taken for granted.",

The half-life of corona virus in aerosol shows a median of approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours and 95% confidence intervals of 0.64 to 2.64. The virus has an exponential decay in titer, as indicated by a linear decrease in the log10 TCID50 per liter of air over time [38]. Based on these data and considering that all endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating and performed in close and prolonged contact with the patient, digestive endoscopy must be considered as a discipline with a very high risk of contagion [24, 25, 26,30]. Cough, retching, and vomiting which can generate aerosols as well as flatus, occurring during colonoscopy, disseminate germs to the surroundings [39].",

Nevertheless, the virus titer was greatly reduced after 72 hours on plastic (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium) and after 48 hours on stainless steel (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium). No viable virus particles were measured on copper, after 4 hours, and on cardboard after 24 hours. The half-life of corona virus is longest on stainless steel and plastic, compared to that on copper and cardboard; its estimated median half-life is approximately 5.6 hours on stainless steel and 6.8 hours on plastic.

Indeed, some patients show a wide range of symptoms, but others have minimal symptoms or are completely asymptomatic [17,18,25,44]. Moreover, the spread of the virus can occur from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, with the same severity [26,28,37,45]. These asymptomatic but infectious subjects represent a huge source of contagion, and for this reason some Authors named them as super-spreaders.

Surgical masks are designed to block large particles and they are ineffective in blocking small aerosol particles (< 5 \u00b5m) to reduce the risk of CoViD-19 contagion [42]. Unlike surgical masks, FFP2 and FFP3 masks are very reliable to reduce the risk of CoViD-19 contagion, filtering at least 95% of aerosols (<5 \u03bcm) and droplet-size (5 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm) particles. The only difference between these two types of masks consists in the maximum loss of filtering: up to 8% for FFP2 and up to 2% for FFP3 [47]. Note that FFP3 is the European measurement standard equivalent to the American N95. The Food and Drug Administration defines the N95 mask as a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. The 'N95\u2032 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the mask blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even if properly fitted, N95 mask does not completely eliminate the risk of infection [48]. The technical features of the different types of facial masks are summarized in table 7\n.",
