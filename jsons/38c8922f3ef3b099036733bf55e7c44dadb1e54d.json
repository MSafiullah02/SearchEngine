The virus primarily spreads between people through respiratory droplets, which are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. The risk of getting severe COVID-19 is higher in health care workers (HCWs) who are in close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The latest figures show thousands of HCWs getting infected with a large percentage of them dying [4] .",

This low knowledge and practice may be because of recently circulating messages on social media claiming the proper way to wear the threelayered surgical mask, like \"colored side facing out if you are sick, and the white side facing out if you want to 'stop the germs from getting in'\". This is, however, false and misleading, according to Nawhen, a columnist for Medical Mythbusters Malaysia, a non-governmental organization that works to counter myths and inaccurate facts on medical matters; the correct way to wear a surgical mask is by wearing the colored side facing out independent of your health status. The outer colored layer is hydrophobic or is a fluid-repelling layer and its main function is to prevent germs from sticking to it, whereas the inner one is a hydrophilic layer that absorbs moisture from the air we breathe out. If you wear it the other way round, the moisture from the air will stick onto it, thus making it easier for germs to stay there. There is a middle layer that actually filters the microorganism [13] .",

It is highly unlikely for low-income countries that they will be able to provide disposable face masks for that extended period of time and may have to ration the use of these products. In this study, around 88.2% HCWs agreed that cloth mask is not as effective as a regular surgical mask and about 79.8% knew that used surgical face mask cannot be re-used. Around 75.6% knew the correct maximum duration of using it. Other studies also highlighted similar findings concluding that cloth mask, re-use, and extended use of mask makes it ineffective, still HCWs are sometimes forced to do it due to the increasing shortage of these masks. We observed that wearing the same mask without removing it between patient encounters and disposing it properly at the end of the day is better than re-using it. Still if re-using it due to shortage, it is better to fold the mask in such a way that the outer contaminated surface is held inward followed by storing it in a clean sealable paper bag or container [14] [15] [16] .",
