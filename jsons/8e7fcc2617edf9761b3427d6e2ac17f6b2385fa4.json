This study investigated representations of the Ebola virus/disease in South African news reports (March 2014 -June 2015. Four discourses were found to operate within the globalised social context: threat to humanity, predation, invasion, and conspiracy. The South African reportage framed Ebola as a predator and criminal rather than using stock warfare imagery. Representations indicated alignment with phobic high-income countries and colonial hegemony.",

Online media thus played a role in public circulation of fear and hysteria, and also contributed to (improper) psychosocial management of affected persons. To demonstrate this, Mondragon, de Montes and Valencia (2017) showed that laypersons' social representations depicted Ebola as being definitively African (particularly in being linked to poverty), along with portrayals of dread about entering the affected countries and 'backward' Africa lacking competence to manage the disease. Localised social support for and stigma towards survivors added to the global fears originating in high-income countries, detracting from public education, as well as from the political and economic challenges in the affected regions (Foster & Dashwood, 2014) . The fear, which implicated stigma, showed that implementing just a clinical response to patients was insufficient (as the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] crisis warned society previously) because psychosocial care was needed to help both stigmatised patients and their caregivers (Davtyan, Brown, & Folayan, 2014 ; van Bortel et al., 2016) . Survivors were stigmatised through a contagion discourse because they were denied jobs by potential employers and refused treatment by health workers (Mayhew, 2016) .",

In the discourse of hope (Washer, 2004) , the risk of infection remains relegated to 'primitive' peoples, making this the West's way of talking so that it does not consider itself to be at risk as long as its borders are not transgressed. As conceptualised by Aaltola (2012) , Western lay people usually watch a scenario unfolding elsewhere and judge performers on a foreign disease stage. This reinforces the 'us' and 'other' distinction. The affected regions get viewed in Western newspaper reports through colonialist images of Africa as a jungle where people eat monkeys and fruit bats, and have cultural practices that promote disease transmission (Abeysinghe, 2016) . Olivier (2007) considers that any uncontrolled constituent of nature such as a virus (particularly when associated with an African jungle) represents a threat to humanity and civilisation, and is relegated to an 'abject' position. This threatens Western capitalistic society's notion of taming nature and, in so doing, shows up the precariousness of a technological society whose survival is based on the idea that nature is controllable.",

These have included notions of battle, combating of infection, counterattack, invasion, and fight (Sontag, 2003) . Metaphors function as a conduit to disseminate scientific knowledge to nonexperts, but they have discursive and sociopolitical consequences (Larson, Nerlich, & Wallis, 2005) , contributing to particular media framings of disease, such as those of war or a plague in the case of Ebola (Vellek, 2016) . Vellek's (2016) deductive content analysis shows that such images in reports in wide-reaching newspapers in the US, UK and Singapore located Ebola within a mutation-contagion frame. However, using war metaphors is a choice made by journalists. As Larson et al. (2005) have shown, UK newspapers avoided war metaphors in reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease (EID), just like Ebola.",

            "text": "Common images about social, psychological, and national threats have been used in Ebola discourse. Predominantly, the Ebola virus, based on the outbreaks occurring until 2001, was subjected to a rhetorical construction of predation (Weldon, 2001a) . Weldon argued that, in comparison to other deadly viruses, Ebola does not kill millions of people and representations of the epidemic were based on misperceptions and, specifically, on predation images derived from a 1994 text, The Hot Zone (Preston as cited in Weldon, 2001a Weldon, , 2001b ). Weldon's (2001a) analysis of the predatory discourse showed that 'the issue with Ebola involves a rhetorical construction, in addition to a social construction' (p. 8). The discursive construction of Ebola functioned to detract responsibility from the problem of compromised medical practice for managing Ebola. This shift, through personifying the virus that led to fear being elicited by this construction, removed focus away from the poor health systems and practices of the affected areas. Movies and books, which capitalised on this image at that time, further shifted agency away from humans responsible for the spread (Weldon, 2001a) . Images of war, fire, and mythical potency contributed to this predatory discourse. Weldon (2001a) argued that these were exaggerations because of the epidemiological fact that needle sharing at clinics in Zaire and Sudan led to fatalities in the earlier epidemics. In other words, governmental systems and human agency threatened the broader-accepted belief system that Western medicine was infallible. As one epidemiologist and microbiologist also pointed out, the clinical picture presented in Preston's book is inaccurate (T. C. Smith, 2014) . Weldon (2001a) further speaks of Ebola's representation within conspiracy discourses because of the global threat of bioweapons. Besides state or US conspiracy, human blood was positioned as a coagent or as being in conspiracy with the virus. Through this discourse, the sentient virus instructs the blood what to do, transforming Ebola into a mythical entity that displaces the human medical practitioner as true agent of transmission in the epidemics that occurred until 2001. Whereas an 'objective' account would point out human mistakes and the health-practitioner carelessness, Weldon (2001a) attributes the dominating predatory discourse to Preston's classic, purportedly nonfiction text.",

In this article, we therefore aim to illustrate how fear was the effect of particular representations that emanate from cultural and metaphorical content in news reports in the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Put differently, we aimed to identify discourses that created a sociocultural reality about Ebola.",

Simply, they discussed associations and reached consensus by focusing on the relevance of meanings to the research question. Because the meanings arose from the social worlds and culturally consensual realities of the researchers as South Africans who wished to interrogate the representations of diseases, but who were also often sympathetic to African disasters and human loss, they acknowledge that, in line with discursive practice, their shared subjectivities are instrumental in making interpretations following a poststructuralist approach as opposed to aiming for an objectivist and realist encounter with the texts.",

Pandemics imply 'movement, directionality and contagious spread'; boundaries become porous, leading to zones cordoned off for containment (Aaltola, 2012, p. 668) . This discourse was also found in Vellek's (2016) content analysis of newspaper reports of Ebola as a global threat, one made possible by easier travel options in the modern world. However, this discourse, when used in the earlier outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, had the effect of protecting individual governments because it sidestepped the real factors that led to fatalities, that is, the economic and systemic constraints reflected in staff not being trained or enough supplies not being provided (Garrettas cited in Weldon, 2001a) . Kamradt-Scott (2016) , therefore, in explaining the WHO's reform of global health security -although late for West Africa -comments that the affected countries' governments should have been more proactive by asking for help because of the global risks. Thus, the effect of the threat to humanity discourse is to detract from national governments' responsibilities and failures, allocating passivity and even invisibility to their actions and roles while uncontrolled agency is granted to the virus. The uncontrolled agency is also figured into the discourse of invasion which reveals the process that unfolds with graphic descriptions of territorial uncontainment. In other words, the threat to humanity discourse, which rests on the universal globalised fear, is the outer layer of the sinister (unseen) process of invasion.",

Abeysinghe's (2016) study of news reports showed that Ebola became written about not as an African problem or global problem, but as a problem for once safe and enclosed countries -a discourse also taken up by South African texts in our sample. The discourse of invasion by a force of nature feeds into political and psychological fears. Consequently, Australian health professionals experienced anxiety and were faced with moral challenges because they had to decide 'how benevolent they were, how much they would sacrifice, and the extent of their care' (Broom & Broom, 2017, p. 213 , italics in the original). Furthermore, invasion discourse is key to militaristic metaphoricity. As Larson and colleagues (2005) -referring to invasive species -explain, news reports, when allocating agency to an entity, are able to justify militaristic and nationalistic responses.",

Stigmatised groups redefine how they are represented (e.g., as unsanitary) through the use of conspiracy theories (Joffe, 2011) . Washer (2011) asserts that the aim of conspiracy theories is to direct blame back at the West, thereby challenging dominant medical discourses. Our findings showed two types of conspiracy theories, based on whether agency was directed either to phobic high-income countries or within the affected countries. Conspiracy notions led to an uncoordinated and slow response because, close to civil war zones, people in the outbreak area distrusted the government. Infected people did not access treatment facilities (representing the untrustworthy government), and they died at home: This added to understaffed facilities not managing contagious dead bodies, resorting to sending the bodies back to their homes (Brown, Arkell, & Rokadiya, 2015) . The conspiracy theme, represented in movies, mobilises global action (Weldon, 2001a) . Thus, journalists' quoting of people's conspiracy ideas accentuates global attention. Conspiracy theories also allow people to cope with collective trauma -particularly when attributing causes to outgroups and in doing so, they also problematise the dominant discourses (Franks et al., 2013) which, in South African press reports, related either to medical understandings or predatory images.",

In addition, there may have been newspapers that were absent from the database. That the outbreak occurred 3 years ago does not imply the current study is delayed or irrelevant. The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak was the largest, with approximately 28,639 cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] , 2016). In comparison, approximately 2,427 cases were reported in all outbreaks before 2013 (CDC, 2016) . Fatalities from the 2013 outbreak, as well as the media representations, point to lessons. The fear discourse spread worldwide, unlike the current 2018-2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has approximately 1,082 cases since August 2018 (WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019) and no similar global hysteria. The DRC outbreak has been difficult to manage partly because of violence stemming from the community's mistrust of Western medicine and medical staff (WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019). Our study highlights discourses similarly contained in the social construction of disease, enhancing understandings about how epidemics are represented in the public sphere, and the findings suggest that media use alternative discourses that could bring social cohesion, social action, and organised medical management, rather than disease management being disabled by fear and conspiracy.",

The consensus among the press reports was that South Africa was not at risk, but the discourses have implications. First, reflected in this study through the threat to humanity discourse, Africa's deviation from Western norms was implied to be the cause of Ebola, and this upholds colonial hegemony. Second, the discourse of a human criminal who stalks victims seems more distinctive of South African news reportage compared to discourses in other studies' findings that relied instead on images of a predatory microorganism. Crime headlines in South Africa are not uncommon, and the Ebola reportage deployed similar crime rhetoric. The more common image in other studies about diseases (e.g., AIDS, the plague, tuberculosis) was the waging of a war against an intruder. Ebola, in our research findings, was represented not as a mere intruder but as a human predator. This shift could be considered within the context of individualisation of health risks rather than nationalistic protection because globalisation has removed borders; and readers, rather than nations that can wage war, are allocated responsibility for their health risks. The news reader is incited to be on the lookout for the lurking predator. In the 21st century and in a country at peace, crime against an individual elicits personalised fear, in contrast to the older image of a war that threatens national security. The fear that media incites only occurs because of flaws in health-risk communication, as well as in 'our fundamentally flawed human psychology . . . The real tragedy of this failure is in the consequences of that fear reaction, both intended and unintended' (James, 2014, p. 465) . Even if fear discourse could help speed up medical research, the predatory discourse, according to Weldon (2001b) , is dangerous globally because it reveals an unsophisticated understanding about humans' biological relationship with the world through their environmental and scientific intrusions. Poor disease control and medical malpractice spread the disease rather than an anthropomorphised entity (Weldon, 2001a) , or virulence (Brown et al., 2015; Weldon, 2001b) .",
