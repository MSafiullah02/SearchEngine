Several consensus papers regarding the delivery of Radiation Therapy (RT) in different settings and cancer histologies have just been published in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection in Radiation Oncology departments, suggesting to treat patients with hypofractionated schemes and to prioritise radical over adjuvant treatments [1,2]. The development of Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) during the last two decades has allowed radiation oncologists to fix any set-up error, to verify the target position and to even perform adaptive radiotherapy, but can also be useful to assess healthy lung tissue [3].",

On the 26th she underwent radiotherapy on T6 and T11 with single fractions of 8 Gy each. The treatment was delivered on a TrueBeam STX (v2.5), with a multiple field static IMRT technique. Before treatment a Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed to check the setup of the patient. The acquisition protocol used for CBCT imaging was: half fan and full rotation, 125 kV and 270 mAs and half bow-tie filter applied, and no iterative reconstruction applied.",

Some suspected lung areas of Ground Glass Opacities (GGOs) were clearly visible in the CBCT without any counterpart in the previous scan [Figure 1\n]; after discussion with the Radiologist, it was decided to perform a new chest CT-scan that confirmed the previously suspected GGOs [Figure 2\n]. In fact, the exam revealed multiple bilateral areas of subpleural GGOs, which are the primary findings on CT-scan in the early phases of COVID-19 lung infection, and also pleural effusions, a finding that may occur as a complication of COVID-19. The patient then urgently repeated the Sars-CoV-2 test that was positive, confirming the infection. On the 28th of March she was transferred to the Infective disease COVID-19 department where she is still hospitalized when we are writing this paper.",
