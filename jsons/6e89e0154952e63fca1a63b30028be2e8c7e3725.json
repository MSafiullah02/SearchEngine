The dimensions of the fabricated cantilever beams are in the range of 4-5 \u03bcm in length, 1-2 \u03bcm in width and 20-30 nm in thickness. The frequency spectra of the cantilever beams, due to thermal and ambient noise, are measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer under ambient conditions. The change in resonant frequency as a function of the virus particle mass binding on the cantilever beam surface forms the basis of the detection scheme. This device can detect a single vaccinia virus particle with an average mass of 9.5 fg. Such devices can be very useful as components of biosensors for the detection of airborne virus particles.

The biological activity of Knob protein immobilized on the nanotube surfaces was confirmed by using its labeled conjugate antibody. The activity and specificity of bound CAR on SWCNTs was evaluated first, in the presence of fluorescently labeled Knob, which interacts specifically with CAR, and second, with a negative control protein, YieF, which is not recognized by biologically active CAR proteins. In addition, current-gate voltage measurements on a dozen nanotube devices explored the effect of protein binding on the intrinsic electronic properties of the SWCNTs, and demonstrated the devices' high sensitivity in detecting protein activity. All data show that both Knob and CAR immobilized on SWCNT surfaces fully retain their biological activities, suggesting that SWCNT-CAR complexes can serve as biosensors for detecting environmental adenoviruses.",

Although established methods, such as PCR, virus isolation, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to detect viruses, field samples with low virus count pose major challenges in virus surveillance and discovery. A unique CNT size-tunable enrichment microdevice (CNT-STEM) can efficiently enrich and concentrate viruses collected from field samples (Yeh et al. 2016) . The channel sidewall in the microdevice was made by growing arrays of vertically aligned nitrogen-doped multiwalled CNTs (N-MWCNT), where the intertubular distance between CNTs could be engineered in the range of 17-325 nm to accurately match the size of different viruses. By adjusting the iron catalyst thickness, the intertubular distance between N-MWCNTs can be adjusted to snag and trap viruses. The CNT-STEM significantly improves detection limits and virus isolation rates by at least 100 times. Using this device, the authors successfully identified an emerging avian influenza virus strain as shown in Fig. 14.1. The device is useful for low handling viral titer samples filled with contaminants. Once virus samples are purified, the researchers can transport the sealed device to a lab for analysis by NGS, PCR, ELISA, or other tests.",

            "text": "The rapid detection of viruses in biological samples is of increasing interest, particularly with the recent emergence of new viruses. A device that can quickly and easily detect them is difficult to construct because viral particles are present at such low concentrations in biological samples, such as blood. Typical procedures involve using passive diffusion to get the viral particles to bind to an antibody, a slow process that is not feasible for many applications, such as on the battlefield, where quick results are critical. However, liquid crystals are known to amplify signals from low concentrations of viral particles, quickly indicating if a virus is present on a surface. A study to speed up the collection of viral particles, particularly vesicular stomatitis virus, used directed assembly, in which external electrical and fluid flow fields are designed to drive nanoparticles to specific locations and in specific concentrations on a substrate (Docoslis et al. 2007 ). Electrical fields are advantageous because by designing the electrodes in a certain way, engineers can control directionality and intensity of electrical forces acting on nanoparticles. By using electrodes separated by just a few micrometers together with electrothermally induced fluid flow, one can accelerate the transport of viral particles from aqueous suspensions with physiological ionic strength to specific points on a surface, allowing them to reach local concentrations high enough to enable subsequent rapid detection. These observations provide a potentially useful approach for addressing a bottleneck in the development of devices that allow for rapid sampling and 'on-the-spot' detection of infectious biological agents such as viruses.

Although such medicines have been developed for some respiratory viruses, they are not used often as therapy because they are only effective if given early in the course of infection. By the time current tests identify the virus, it is generally too late for them to work. 2. Reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Currently, physicians often prescribe antibiotics for respiratory illnesses. However, antibiotics combat respiratory illness caused by bacteria and are ineffective on viral infections. An early virus detection method would reduce the frequency with which doctors prescribe antibiotics for viral infections inappropriately, thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic side-effects and cutting down on the development of antibiotic-resistance in bacteria. 3. Allow hospital personnel to isolate RSV patients. RSV is extremely infectious so early detection would allow hospital personnel to keep the RSV patients separate from other patients who are especially susceptible to infection, such as those undergoing bone-marrow transplants.",

The \"gold standard\" involves incubating an infected sample in a tissue culture for a few days and then using a fluorescent dye to test for the presence of the virus. The main problem with this technique is that the virus is multiplying in the patient at the same time as it is growing in the culture. This has caused many hospitals to switch to real time PCR, which is extremely sensitive but still takes several hours because of the need for a technician well trained in molecular biologist to conduct the test in a reference laboratory. The third method, the antigen test, takes ~30 min but it is not sensitive enough to detect the presence of the virus at the early stages of an infection. By comparison, the QD method takes 1-2 h and is even more sensitive than real time PCR. It can detect the presence of RSV within an hour after the virus is added to a culture. QDs have an advantage over many traditional fluorophores because their fluorescence properties can be finely tuned and they are resistant to photobleaching (Halfpenny and Wright 2010) .",

The technique measures the change in frequency of a near-infrared laser as it scatters viral DNA or RNA. That change in frequency is as distinct as a fingerprint. This novel SERS assay can detect spectral differences between viruses, viral strains, and viruses with gene deletions in biological media.

Unlike most existing diagnostic detection techniques which are based on optical detection methods that require pure samples and multiple processing steps, T2's technology is not optical and therefore does not require purification of biological samples. The significant advantage allows the T2 system to perform single-step processing and rapid turnaround times without the need for trained technicians. Furthermore, the technology can accurately identify almost any specimen, including proteins, nucleic acids, or enzymes; microbes; or small molecule drug compounds within almost any sample, including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine.

Nanobacterialike particles have been detected in synovial fluids of arthritis patients and were shown to gradually increase in number and in size in culture (Tsurumoto et al. 2006) . Nanobacteria have been implicated in a variety of human diseases associated with pathological calcification. Their most remarkable characteristic is the formation of carbonate apatite crystals of neutral pH and at physiologic phosphate and calcium concentrations. The extracellular mineralization forms a hardprotective shelter for these hardy microorganisms, and enables them to survive conditions of physical stress that would be lethal to most other bacterial species. The Olavi Kajander group (Finland) suggests that the apatite produced by nanobacteria may play a key role in the formation of all kidney stones, by providing a central calcium phosphate deposit around which other crystalline components can collect. Nanobacteria seem to be causative agents of diseases related to biomineralization processes. Nanobacteria are also associated with calcified geological specimens, human kidney stones and psammona bodies in ovarian cancer. Much research has focused attention on the potential role these particles may play in the development of urologic pathology, including polycystic kidney disease, renal calculi, and chronic prostatitis. Nanobacteria may be an important etiological factor for type III prostatitis, which was reproduced in rat prostate infection models by infusing nanobacteria suspension transurethrally (Shen et al. 2010) . Recent clinical research on agents targeting nanobacteria has proven effective in treating some patients with refractory category III prostatitis.",

Targeting specificity was confirmed by demonstrating a lack of binding to mammalian cells, reduced photothermal and antibiotic killing of the Spa-negative species Staphylococcus epidermidis, and reduced killing of S. aureus in the presence of unconjugated anti-Spa antibodies. The authors demonstrated that laser irradiation at levels within the current safety standard for use in humans can be used to achieve both a lethal photothermal effect and controlled release of the antibiotic, thus resulting in a degree of therapeutic synergy capable of eradicating viable S. aureus cells. The system was validated using planktonic bacterial cultures of both methicillinsensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. This approach has the potential to be expanded to deal with other bacterial pathogens that could be targeted by substituting an effective antibiotic and an appropriate targeting agent (antibody, peptide, etc.).

The protective coverings formed by the lipids not only ensure the safe delivery of the peptides to the area where they are needed, but also intensify their action at the target site.

NPs have shown promise in treating bacterial infections, but a significant challenge has been to develop a formulation that may be suitable for systemic administration. Drug-encapsulated, pH-responsive, surface charge-switching poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(l-histidine)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PLH-PEG) nanoparticles have now been developed for treating bacterial infections (Radovic-Moreno et al. 2012). Antibiotic-carrying NPs were designed to switch their charge depending on their environment. While they circulate in the bloodstream, the particles have a slight negative charge. However, when they encounter an infection site, the particles gain a positive charge, allowing them to tightly bind to bacteria and release their drug payload. This switch is provoked by the slightly acidic environment surrounding bacteria, which is due to lack of oxygen triggering a change in bacterial metabolism, leading them to produce organic acids. The body's immune cells, neutrophils, also produce acids as they try to consume the bacteria. These NP drug carriers are designed to shield nontarget interactions at pH 7.4 but bind avidly to bacteria in acidity, delivering drugs and mitigating in part the loss of drug activity with declining pH. NP binding studies demonstrate pH-sensitive NP binding to bacteria with a ~3.5-fold increase in binding to bacteria at pH 6.0 compared to 7.4. Further, PLGA-PLH-PEG-encapsulated vancomycin demonstrates reduced loss of efficacy at low pH, with an increase in minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.3-fold as compared to 2-fold and 2.3-fold for free and PLGA-PEG-encapsulated vancomycin, respectively. The PLGA-PLH-PEG NPs are a first step toward developing systemically administered drug carriers that can target and potentially treat Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or polymicrobial infections associated with acidity. This approach would enable targeted delivery of high doses of antibiotics over an extended period to overcome antibiotic resistance, but protect the beneficial bacteria that normally live inside human bodies. A potential challenge to this approach is that negatively charged tissue cells and proteins at infection sites can compete with bacteria in binding to nanoparticles and potentially block them from binding to bacteria. The investigators are studying how much this might limit the effectiveness of the NP delivery. They are also conducting studies in animals to determine whether the particles will remain pH-sensitive in the body and survive in the circulation long enough to reach their targets.",

Nanofiltration, use of nanotechnology in viral removal filtration systems, is an important safety step in the manufacture of plasma-derived coagulation factor concentrates and other biopharmaceutical products from human blood. Nanofiltration of plasma products has already been carried out since the early 1990s to improve margin of viral safety, as a complement to the viral reduction treatments, such as solventdetergent and heat treatments, which are applied for the inactivation of HIV as well as hepatitis B and C viruses. The main reason for the introduction of nanofiltration was the need to improve product safety against non-enveloped viruses and to provide a possible safeguard against new infectious agents potentially entering the human plasma pool. Nanofiltration has gained quick acceptance as it is a relatively simple manufacturing step that consists in filtering protein solution through membranes with nanopores (pore size typically 15-40 nm) under conditions that retain viruses by a mechanism largely based on size exclusion. Recent large-scale experience throughout the world has now established that nanofiltration is a robust and reliable viral reduction technique that can be applied to essentially all plasma products. Many of the licensed plasma products are currently nanofiltered. The technology has major advantages as it is flexible and it may combine efficient and largely predictable removal of a wide range of viruses. Compared with other viral reduction means, nanofiltration may be the only method to date permitting efficient removal of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses under conditions where 90-95% of protein activity is recovered. New data indicate that nanofiltration may also remove prions, opening new perspectives in the development of this technique.",

As drug resistance appears, a new generation of therapeutic strategies will be required. Use of RNA immune activator molecule is limited by their instability when delivered into cells but this can be overcome by using a nanobiotechnology-based delivery system. Gold nanorods protect the RNA from degrading once inside cells, while allowing for more selected targeting of cells Usefulness of delivery of a biocompatible gold nanorod, GNR-5\u2032PPP-ssRNA nanoplex, has been demonstrated for innate immune activation against type A influenza virus (Chakravarthy et al. 2010) . In human respiratory bronchial epithelial cells, this nanoplex containing the single strand RNA molecule activated the retinoic acidinducible gene I pathogen recognition pathway, resulting in increased expression of IFN (interferon)-\u03b2 and other IFN-stimulated genes (e.g. PKR, MDA5, IRF1, IRF7, and MX1), which resulted in a decrease in the replication of H1N1 influenza viruses. The novelty of this approach is that most of RNA viruses share a common hostresponse immune pathway, and enhancement of the host immune response reduces the ongoing viral resistance generated through mutations. Diseases that could be effectively targeted with this new approach include any viruses that are susceptible to the innate immune response triggered by IFN. Animal studies have started based on these in vitro results, and further evaluation of biocompatible nanoplexes as unique antivirals for treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses is warranted.",

As defined by NanoViricides Inc, \"a nanoviricide is a polymeric single chemical chain with covalently attached ligands that specify the virus target. The antiviral spectrum of the drug is determined by the specificity of the set of ligands attached to the chain, in addition to other functionally important aspects inherent in the chemistries\". Nanoviricide is designed to seek a specific virus type, attach to the virus particle, engulf or coat the virus particle, thereby neutralizing the virus's infectivity, destabilize and possibly dismantle the virus particle, and optionally it may also be made capable of attacking the viral genome thereby destroying the virus completely. Active pharmaceutical ingredients are optional and can be hidden in the core of the nanoviricide missile.",

The NanoViricide\u2122 system enables design of a drug that binds to more than one type of site -currently as many as three different sites, on the virus -for a highly effective attack. NanoViricides Inc terms this as \"multi-specific targeting\". A NanoViricide\u2122 drug goes much further than just blocking all of the binding sites of the virus. The base material of a NanoViricide\u2122 is a specially designed polymeric micelle material. It can disassemble an HIV particle by itself. Thus, after coating the virus particle, the NanoViricide\u2122 loosens the virus particle, and weakens it. Some virus particles will even fall apart (uncoat). This provides a further therapeutic benefit. NanoViricides plans to enhance the viral disassembly capabilities of the nanoviricides\u2122 by attaching specially designed \"molecular chisels\" to the NanoViricide\u2122. Once the NanoViricide\u2122 micelles coat the virus particle, the attached \"molecular chisels\" will go to work. They literally insert themselves into the virus coat at specific vulnerable points and pry apart the coat proteins so that the virus particle falls apart readily. The mechanism of action of NanoViricide is depicted schematically in Fig. 14. 2.",

It is possible to develop a research drug against a novel life-threatening viral disease within 3-6 weeks after the infection is found, i.e. as soon as an antibody from any animal source is available. \u2022 It is possible to make a single NanoViricide drug that responds to several viral threats by using targeting ligands against the desired set of viruses in the construction of the drug. It is possible to \"tune\" the specificity and range (spectrum) of a NanoViricide drug within a virus type, subtype, or strain, by appropriate choices of the targeting ligand(s). \u2022 The safety of NanoViricide drugs is proven now as they specifically attack the virus and not the host. Targets for this approach include influenzas, HIV, HCV, rabies and other viruses. NanoViricide drug candidates are currently in preclinical studies. Clinical trials are planned.

FluCide\u2122 nanoviricide is designed as a polymeric surfactant micelle which has covalently attached to it ligands that bind to the influenza A virus on conserved sites. The current drug candidate was effective against both H1 and H5, and different strains of H5. This is a direct result of using a conserved binding strategy, very like that used by zanamivir. However, FluCide is directed to bind to HA rather than to inhibit neuraminidase. Binding to HA followed by putative engulfment of the virus particle should lead to viral load reduction and therapeutic benefit. Preclinical studies have shown that FluCide does more than an antibody does, in that it completes the task of encapsulating and possibly dismantling the virus, rather than merely tagging it for the immune system as a foreign particle. In mouse model of common murine-adapted influenza A/H1N1, it would require about eight times greater dosage of oseltamivir as compared to FluCide to achieve the same survival advantage results. In cell cultures (MDCK and PMKC) against influenza A/H5N1 bird flu strains (Clade 1 and Clade 2), these drug candidates have shown as high as 70% CPE inhibition. An intravenous preparation for systemic administration is in development with a ready-to-use preloaded syringe. Other routes of administration are being explored. A pre-IND briefing document about FluCide has been submitted to the FDA.",

Arbutus has conducted a series of studies in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases demonstrating the ability of TKM-130803 to protect nonhuman primates from EV (Geisbert et al. 2010) . When used to treat infected nonhuman primates, TKM-130803 resulted in complete protection from an otherwise lethal dose of Zaire EV, which has been associated with periodic outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in human populations with mortality rates reaching 90%. These data show the potential of RNAi as an effective postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with EV, and suggest that this strategy might also be useful for treatment of other emerging viral infections. In 2010, Arbutus was awarded up to a $140 million contract from the US Government's Transformational Medical Technologies Program to advance TKM-130803 and IND application was approved by the FDA in 2011 and phase I safety trials with this drug started. The FDA placed a hold on this trial owing to \"cytokine release\", but then partially relaxed it to allow its use in EV-infected patients. In 2014, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation for the further development of TKM-130803. In a single-arm phase II trial, on adults with laboratory-confirmed EVD, administration of TKM-130803 at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day by intravenous infusion to adult patients with severe EVD was not shown to improve survival when compared to historic controls (Dunning et al. 2016) .",
