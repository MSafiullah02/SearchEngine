The government of various countries, their citizens, politicians, and business owners are worried about the unavoidable economic impacts of this pandemic. Therefore, there is an eagerness for the pandemic peaking. Objectives: This study uses an objective approach to emphasize the need to be pragmatic with easing of lockdowns measures worldwide through the forecast of the possible trend of COVID-19. This is necessary to ensure that the enthusiasm about SARS-CoV-2 peaking is properly examined, easing of lockdown is done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. Methods: We used the Facebook prophet on the World Health Organization data for COVID-19 to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the 7 th April until 3rd May 2020. The forecast model was further used to forecast the trend of the virus for the 8 th until 14 th May 2020. We presented the forecast of the confirmed and death cases. Results: Our findings from the forecast showed an increase in the number of new cases for this period. Therefore, the need for easing the lockdown with caution becomes imperative. Our model showed good performance when compared to the official report from the World Health Organization. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.6%.",

These severe symptoms may progress to multi-organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and pneumonia [1] . The severe symptoms have usually resulted in high rates of contacts to the healthcare providers, hospitalization, and admission to the intensive care units (ICU) [5] Around 96, 000 cases were reported in early March 2020 (05/03/2020) [1] . By early April, the number of cases globally has increased to 1,603,330 (10/03/2020) [6] . The rise in the number of cases had resulted in various measures to reduce the spread of this virus. The example of such measures includes lockdown by countries [7] . Other measures include social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine, increased handwashing and sanitizing, temporary closedown of schools, businesses, and international trades.

The dataset and the corresponding libraries were imported to Jupyter Notebook. The data was further preprocessed to remove missing values and ensure that the data is in the proper format. Additionally, the columns were renamed for convenience in the analyses. The visualization of the top 11 countries, Finland, and Nigeria (most populous African country) as of 7 th May 2020 is given in Figure   1 . The actual decomposition of the time series data was done using an additive model. The additive model has been implemented because it is easy to develop, fast to train, and provides interpretable patterns 9 . We used the last 3 months of the COVID-19 cases to forecast for the next 5 days (8 th until 14 th May 2020) using the Facebook Prophet, with a 95% prediction interval by creating a base model using seasonality-related parameters and additional regressors. Note that the yearly and daily seasonality was not set since COVID-19 is not a seasonal disease. The forecast given by our model was compared with the official data reported on the World Health Organization (WHO) official website for COVID-19 updates for the same date. The dashboard of WHO's official website for comparison is available at https://covid19.who.int/. The result of the comparison for 07.04.2020 -03.05.2020 is presented in Table 1 . We also presented the model forecast for the 8 th until 14 th May 2020 to further validate our model prior to the official release of the cases by the World Health Organization.",

This approach was aimed at emphasizing that the easing of lockdowns in various countries should be done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. We produced a forecast model using a Facebook prophet that used additive models [11] . A Facebook prophet was used as it is accurate, fast, fully automatic, offers tunable forecast, and compatible with Python or R [12] . Of note, as this is not a seasonal occurrence and the fact that there is no known vaccine yet, we assume that the trend will continue indefinitely in the modelling. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.9%. The differences between our forecast model and the WHO official reported cases may be due to the possible errors, delay or inadequate reporting by various countries. Despite this variation, our forecast model still showed reasonable accuracy to forecast the confirmed and death cases for the target dates. The fact that the confirmed cases increases significantly between Wednesdays and Saturdays may account for the time taken to get and record the results from these tests.",

Additionally, the next 7 days (8 th -14 th May 2020) prediction of the pandemic COVID-19 showed a rise in the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 globally (Figure 2-3). As shown in Figure 2, few cases were confirmed between Mondays until Wednesdays. Likewise, most deaths occurred between Tuesdays and Thursdays (Figure 3). Towards easing the lockdown, the World Health Organization published six (6) important criteria that includes evidence that the transmission of COVID-19 is controlled, effective mechanism of contract tracing, quarantine, and testing, minimized outbreaks amongst the vulnerable in care homes, continuous adherence to preventive measures (physical distancing, handwashing, etc.), importation risks can be managed, and proper information and engagement of the communities concerning the pandemic [9]. Most countries have published tentative plans to ease the lockdown measuresto address the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown by our predictive model, restarting the economies that had been significantly affected by the sudden shutdowns to curb the devastating effects of COVID-19 this should be done with caution[10]. This is necessary to avoid a possible second-wave of the virus which could have more damaging consequences[10].",
