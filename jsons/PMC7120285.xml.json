Within a year, the World Health Organization [WHO] reported 8096 cases with 774 deaths [9.6% fatality] in >30 countries from five continents, and the outbreak was declared a pandemic infection [1]. In the elderly and subjects with significant comorbid illness, the mortality rate was up to 50%. Investigations revealed that SARS was due to a novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV] which was circulating among wild game animals in wet markets of southern China. The palm civet, a wild feline, was considered the amplification host that transmitted the virus to humans from occupational contact and handling by consumers during the preparation for consumption as a delicacy [2, 3]. SARS-CoV mainly spread from human to human by respiratory droplets or by contact of mucosae with contaminated fomites. Spread of SARS-CoV from mainland China to Hong Kong and other countries was from interpersonal transmission in healthcare facilities, homes, workplaces, and public transports [1].",

However, an outbreak of MERS was subsequently reported from South Korea in June 2015. The illness occurred in an older man who returned from traveling to Saudi Arabia, and within a month 17 secondary cases occurred in South Korea which was connected to the index case [6]. Within 2 months the local outbreak resulted in a total of 186 confirmed cases of MERS in South Korea, except for one case exported to China. There were 36 deaths attributed to MERS-CoV infection with a mortality rate of 19.4% [6].",

            "text": "Coronaviruses\nare the largest RNA viruses and they are enveloped with positive-strand genomes of 26\u201332 kb, and they are distributed globally in a wide range of animals and humans [7]. The coronaviruses are classified in four genera based on phylogenetic analysis: alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, gamma-coronaviruses, and delta-coronaviruses [7]. Some strains of coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 [a beta-coronavirus] and HCoV-229E [an alpha-coronavirus], are causative agents of the common cold and rarely severe respiratory disease [8, 9]. Other newly discovered human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL634 and HCoV-HKU1, are occasionally associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and immunocompromised patients [10, 11]. SARS-CoV is a lineage B beta-coronavirus and MERS-CoV is a novel beta-coronavirus of lineage C, and both these viruses appear to have crossed the species barrier from bats to humans [12, 13]. Bats are reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses [13\u201315]. Various SARS-like coronaviruses have been found in bats from China, Asia, and Europe, but none were considered as direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Recently, however, investigators from China reported whole genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats closely related to SARS-CoV [16]. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein was very similar to that of SARS-CoV, and one of the isolates [bat SL-CoV-w1V1] uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] from humans\n, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry [16]. SARS-CoV was previously shown to use human ACE2 molecule as its entry receptor, an outstanding feature of its cross-species transmissibility [17]. Thus, the bat SL-CoV-WIVI may be the ancestor virus that precedes the evolution of SARS-CoV in humans.",

MERS-CoV, on the other hand, uses human and bat dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4] as receptor for cell entry [19]. Replication and RNA protein synthesis by MERS-CoV can occur in human airway epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, microvascular endothelium, and alveolar type II pneumocytes [20]. Hence MERS-CoV has a broader tissue tropism than the SARS-CoV. The mechanism of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV interspecies transmission appears to be mediated by the S protein, by mediating receptor recognition and membrane fusion, a key factor\nin host specificity [21].",

Furthermore, Gu et al. [18] estimated that the extent of immune cell damage is a better predictor of outcome than the damage to the lungs. Other investigators judge the lung injury and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] and pulmonary fibrosis as the primary events leading to adverse outcome and death. Using multiple modes of investigation, modeling with gene sets, proteomic analysis, and histopathology correlation, these investigators conclude that the urokinase and the extracellular fibrinolytic pathways are the primary mechanisms involved in lung damage and overall SARS-CoV infection pathogenesis [22]. Events driven by these pathways result in imbalance between the host coagulation\nand fibrinolysin pathways, ultimately leading to diffuse alveolar and acute lung damage. It is likely, however, that both mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

A recent study compared the viral replication, cytokine/chemokine response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoV-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages [MDMs] and SARS-CoV-infected MDMs [23]. Only MERS-CoV and not SARS-CoV could replicate in human macrophages, but both viruses could not stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines, interferon-alpha [IFN-\u03b1], and IFN-\u03b2. Comparable levels of tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1 and interleukin [IL]-6 could be induced by both viruses. However, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of IL-12, IFN-\u00a5, and several chemokines than SARS-CoV [23]. In addition, the expression of major histocompatibility complex [HLA] class 1 and costimulatory molecules were greater in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs than SARS-CoV-infected cells. The establishment of productive infection in macrophages and dendritic cells results in impaired antigen-presenting pathway, and greater aberrant induction of cytokines/chemokines by MERS-CoV could explain the higher severity of infection and greater mortality than SARS-CoV infection [23]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that MERS-CoV\nhas the capacity to infect T lymphocytes and induce apoptosis of these cells by activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways [24]. MERS-CoV-derived proteins inhibit IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2 expression [25], resulting in lower IFN levels in the respiratory tract [26], and lower expression of type 1 IFN in fatal cases [27]. Persistent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil activation, and chemotactic response can result in damage to surrounding uninfected lung tissues [27]. Furthermore, MERS-CoV can impair activation of the adaptive immunity through multiple mechanisms: downregulation of antigen-presenting pathways to inhibit activation of T-cells [28], infection of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells of peripheral blood lymphoid organs [tonsils and spleen], and extensive apoptosis of T-cells can result in impaired T- and B-cell function as the helper T-cells are also affected.",

Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV was considered rare or unlikely, but may have occurred in one community outbreak from generation\nof negative pressure by exhaust fans with dissemination of contaminated aerosols from sewage drains [33]. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV, which was a major source of the outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto, was enhanced with the use of nebulizers, suction, intubation, bronchoscopy, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, from generation of high amount of infectious droplets [1].

There is increasing evidence that camels are the intermediate hosts responsible for cross-species transmission to humans\n. Cross-reactive antibodies to MERS-CoV have been found in dromedary camels in Oman, Canary Islands, and Egypt [37, 38]. Further studies have also confirmed the presence of MERS-CoV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactor [RT-PCR] assay and partial genome sequencing of viral RNA in 3 of 14 nasal samples collected from 14 camels in Qatar and two subjects from the same farm [39]. In addition, a fatal case of human MERS-CoV infection was transmitted through contact with an infected camel with rhinorrhea, and the full genome sequence of the isolates from the patient and the camel was identical [40]. It has been recently reported that a high proportion of dromedaries at a slaughterhouse shed nasal MERS-CoV, with a high-risk of human exposure and potential of driving the epidemic [41].",

In SARS the initial symptoms were fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, and nonproductive cough, and sore throat and rhinorrhea were less frequent [1]. Clinical deterioration in those with severe illness usually occurred after several days of infection, often heralded by development of diarrhea, evidence of pneumonia, and then respiratory distress. The most common extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS were diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac impairment, myositis, and seizures [1]. Milder disease occurred in children in both SARS and MERS, and increased morbidity and mortality\nwere seen in the elderly, those with significant comorbid illnesses [diabetes, heart disease, etc.], and pregnancy.

Antibody testing was done by various methods, and the virus could be recovered from respiratory secretions, fecal, and occasionally urine specimens by viral culture [1]. Neutralizing antibodies from acute and convalescent sera 3\u20134 weeks later could confirm the diagnosis, and indirect immunofluorescent antibody test\nwas more commonly used [1]. Enzyme immunoassay [EIA] using recombinant nucleocapsid was a rapid screening test with high sensitivity after 5 days of illness, but could cross-react with other human coronaviruses and needed Western blot test for confirmation [51].",

Real-time RT-PCR from a throat swab has been the primary means of confirming the diagnosis, and serological tests were used primarily for epidemiological investigations [42, 43]. Serological tests include recombinant ELISA with the use of the S1 domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein, recombinant immunofluorescence assay with the full spike protein, and plaque-reduction neutralizing assay. RT-PCR is the preferred diagnostic test for acute cases and the virus can also be cultured in Vero cells [40]. Testing for MERS-CoV should be done not only from nasopharyngeal secretions but also from lower respiratory secretions and serum, as detectable virus had been found on occasion from these sites with negative test from the upper respiratory secretions [52]. This is related to the higher viral load of MERS-CoV in lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract. The WHO recommends RT-PCR targets of upE, ORF1a, or ORFb, but recent evaluation\nindicates targeting ORF1b is less sensitive and should not be used for diagnosis [53].",

In one study of two patients with MERS, one died and the other recovered; there was evidence that IFN-\u03b1 generation was critical to initiate a robust immune response [57]. IFN-\u03b1 usually promotes antigen presentation to drive the antiviral Th1 immune response, mediated by IL-12 and IFN-\u00a5 to clear the virus. MERS-CoV could also upregulate IL-17 expression in humans. In the patient who died, there were low IFN-\u03b1 and regulatory factors that are involved in the recognition of the virus, whereas these molecules were elevated in the survivor. In addition there were elevated chemokine ligand levels, CXCL10, and IL-10, associated with low IFN-\u00a5 expression in the non-survivor [57]. It is unclear from this report whether the difference in immune response described in the two patients with different outcome was related to differences in innate immunity or due to viral factors with overwhelming infection suppressing the immunity in the non-survivor. In vitro studies suggest that MERS-CoV\ninduces greater dysfunction of the immune response than SARS-CoV, with downregulation of genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway [28]. To date there has not been any detailed pathological findings of severe MERS cases, probably because of religious customs in the Middle East.",

In order to prevent future coronavirus zoonosis emerging, we need more basic research to fully understand the mechanisms of cross-species virus transmission. Current investigations indicate that the surface S protein of the coronavirus and the host proteases that cleave the protein before membrane fusion are key factors for interspecies transmission [86]. It is believed that two mutations may have allowed the bat coronavirus HJKU4 to enter human cells, enabling the S protein to be activated by human proteases [87]. Could there be environmental or extrinsic factors\nthat facilitate key mutations to enable cross-species transmission from bats to camels to humans, and are these modifiable? These are areas for future research.",

All coronaviruses require proteolytic activity of nsp 5 protease [3CL-pro] during replication, and this has been identified as a common target for development of a general anti-coronavirus agent [88]. Development of a universal antiviral agent for animal coronaviruses may be feasible, but could be difficult, as screening of a peptidomimetic library identified 43 compounds with good to excellent inhibitory potency against a bat coronavirus [HKU4-CoV] [89]. Another target for multiple coronaviruses is the coronavirus helicase [nsp 13], which is also important in viral replication. A replication inhibitor of the viral helicases of SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus, and MERS-CoV, SSYA10-001, may be a suitable candidate as a broad spectrum coronavirus inhibitor [90].",

It has been proposed that vaccine designed for emerging animal coronaviruses should include chimeric spike proteins containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple strains across subgroups [91]. Vaccine manufacturing companies would likely not be enticed on such seemingly nonprofitable enterprise, but scientist should still pursue such a venture, even for proof of concept with animal model experiments, as the need for a universal coronavirus vaccine\nmay arise sometime in the future.",
