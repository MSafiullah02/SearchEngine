It is anticipated that transplant recipients may have a greater viral burden and shedding resulting in greater infectivity and potential spread to other individuals, including healthcare workers. There is a risk of donor to recipient transmission of COVID-19, both from deceased donors and living donors. The risk of donor-derived infection would depend upon donor exposure, infectivity in the incubation period, degree and duration of viremia, and viability of the virus within blood or specific organ compartments [7] . * Sanjiv Saigal sanjivsaigal@hotmail.com COVID-19 virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed) [8] . This raises the concern of nosocomial spread and superspreading events. In addition, patient-topatient and patient-to-healthcare worker infection have been described. Whether COVID-19 can be transmitted parenterally is not known, nevertheless, screening of all blood donors should be done. Preventing transmission from an infected patient to a healthcare worker and vice versa is of great importance. Current recommendations are for both droplet and airborne precautions for infection control in the hospital setting. In general, for the society emphasis should be given on recommended preventive measures against COVID-19 namely social distancing, frequent hand washing, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, following cough etiquettes, etc.",
