However, the incidence of canine distemper virus (CDV) in canines and other animal populations throughout China seems to have increased in the past years. Several CDV outbreaks in vaccinated animals have been reported (Ek-Kommonen et al., 1997, Perpinan et al., 2008). Therefore, CDV wild-type and vaccine strains need to be distinguished for diagnosis and epidemiological monitoring. A previous study (Calderon et al., 2007) has shown significant differences between CDV wild-type and vaccine strains in the H protein, which displays a large number of antigenic variations. Based on this finding, several CDV differential diagnoses between wild-type and vaccine isolates have been established (Martella et al., 2007, Si et al., 2010). However, these methods are all based on reverse-transcription and nested polymerase chain reactions (RT-nPCRs); they have the disadvantages of being time-consuming and susceptible to contamination. Therefore, a method for the specific and easy detection of wild-type CDV strains is required.",

This protocol can be implemented even in small laboratories.

The CDV wild-type strain amino acid sequence was Val and Lys at positions 331 and 502 in H protein (8067 and 8583 nts), respectively. On the other hand, the CDV vaccine strain contained Ile and Arg at the same locations. Based on the molecular sequence investigation of the wild-type local CDV strains, the H gene sequence alignment showed that the identity of the nucleic acid between local and vaccine strains ranged from 90.7% to 91.4%. The CA and G nts were also highly conserved at positions 990\u2013991 and 1506 of the H gene in the vaccine strains. AG and A nts were at the same locations in the local wild-type strains (marked with square in Fig. 6\n). The CDV field strain CDWuhan-14 was not mismatched with the 3\u2032-terminus of the P4 primer at the H gene position, whereas it had the same nt G at position 1506 in the H gene as the CDV vaccine strains. However, the reaction still continued to produce the correct fragment product. Therefore, the primer P3 may be more functional than P4. Additionally, changes in AG/CA and A/G were also observed in other Asia-1 CDVs, Asia-2 CDVs, America-2 CDVs, Europe, and Europe wildlife CDVs. In contrast, a change in GG/CA was found in Africa CDVs (Fig. 7\n).",

Hence, CDV molecular diagnosis methods, such as RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, have been significantly developed (Martella et al., 2007, Scagliarini et al., 2007). Recently, several CDV differential diagnoses between wild-type isolates and vaccines have been established. For example, an RT-PCR lineage-genotyping system based on specific nt polymorphisms scattered over the H gene has been developed. This system is used to characterize major CDV lineages, such as European, Asia-1, Asia-2, Arctic, and Vaccine strains (Martella et al., 2007). In another multiplex PCR assay, primers target the H gene to distinguish field strains from China and vaccine-like strains, such as Onderstepoort (Si et al., 2010). A multiplex amplification refractory mutation system PCR is also used to differentiate seven CDV field isolates in Taiwan (Asia-1 lineage) from vaccine strains based on the untranslated region region between the M and F genes (Chulakasian et al., 2010). Compared with these CDV differentiation assays, the presently proposed method may be conducted more easily and quickly. It making up by two separate steps RT-PCR assays to reduce contamination percentage and time-less in one PCR procedure but not multiplex or nested RT-PCR. CDV field isolates are also more easily distinguished from CDV commercial vaccines used in China. Unfortunately, the present method cannot detect mixed populations of CDV wild-type and vaccine strains, although these are rarely seen in animals. However, the method is still a suitable and easy diagnostic tool for detecting CDVs in animals with suspected CDV disease.",

GenBank accession numbers of the reference strains are as follow: CDV3 (DQ778941), Onderstepoort (AF378705), Convac (Z35493), SnyderHill (AF259552), Yanaka (D85755), Ueno (D85753), Hamamatsu (D85754), Dog98-002 (AB025270), Dog5B (AY297453), DogHM-3 (AB040767), Dog5VD (AY297454), DogTaiwan (AY378091), DogisolateADen (AF478543), DogisolateCDen (AF478547), Dog Denmark (Z47761), US89 (Z47764), Africa 1bn (FJ461713), Africa 4sp (FJ461715), dog GR88 (Z47760), dog 179-94 (DQ226087), 01-2676 (AY498692), 01-2690 (AY465925), H06Ny12HU (DQ889189)and 207/00 IT (DQ228166).",
