            "text": "Live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) have saved millions of lives and continue to prove themselves as one of the most important inventions in modern medical history. Smallpox was successfully eradicated in 1980 using the closely-related vaccinia virus [1], and live measles vaccines averted an estimated 21.1 million deaths between 2010 and 2017 [2]. The immunogenicity of LAVs is superior to other vaccine types: inactivated, subunit, and toxoid vaccines may require additional doses and adjuvants to achieve s\u2013ufficient immunity (Table 1) [3]. In contrast, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides protection against the disease for at least ten years [4]. While some concerns remain about the ability of LAVs to revert toward a wild-type genotype in humans, the adverse effects and risks associated with these vaccines remain very low and are clearly outweighed by the health benefits they provide at a global scale. Over recent years, alarming episodes of pathogen (re-) emergence for which there are no licensed vaccines, such as Ebola, Lassa, or Zika virus, have been witnessed [5,6,7]. Additionally, the emergence potential of currently neglected pathogens such as Powassan virus and Eastern equine Encephalitis Virus [8] strongly highlight the global need for better preparedness against future epidemics.

            "text": "A primary limitation in developing innovative vaccines against today and tomorrow\u2019s challenging infectious diseases is our inability to understand the molecular basis of current LAV attenuation and immunogenicity. This is mainly because of the empiric nature of their development [9]. Traditionally, LAV attenuation has been achieved either through the serial passage of a virulent pathogen or the isolation of a closely related virus or bacterium that produces mild disease in humans, such as cowpox for smallpox vaccines [9]. This means that the existence of a LAV directly correlates with the capacity of its parental or common ancestor strain to evolve and adapt to a novel host or environment. Therefore, LAV attenuation is tied to the stochasticity of evolution. The story of the generation of the yellow fever vaccine strain 17D strongly supports such reasoning. 17D was isolated by serially passaging a virulent yellow fever virus (YFV) strain in mouse and chicken embryo tissues [10]. Despite several attempts to repeat the process, 17D could not be isolated more than once [10]. ",

            "text": "A major roadblock in our quest to understand mechanisms of LAV attenuation and immunogenicity is the absolute need to study human-specific immune responses in vivo and in controlled experimental settings. When studying LAV responses in a cohort of voluntary human vaccinees, peripheral blood can be readily assessed, yet tissues from the site of infection or from secondary lymphoid organs where the immune response is primed cannot. Additionally, to precisely pinpoint the attenuation mechanisms of a LAV, it is important to perform a direct comparison between the immune responses induced by LAVs and by their virulent counterpart. However, such a comparison, as well as the genetic manipulation of the immune system, remains ethically impossible in human patient cohorts. Therefore, our understanding of LAV attenuation and immunogenicity fully relies upon the identification of a cost-effective and easily accessible animal model that can accurately recapitulate human immune responses upon vaccination.",

Mice engrafted with human immune system (HIS mice) components have notably been instrumental in studying the infectious cycle of human-tropic bacteria and viruses in vivo and understanding how these pathogens interact with the human immune system [12,13]. However, the contributions of HIS mice to LAV research has remained limited in comparison to other model systems, such as the human model or non-human primate (NHPs) models, mainly because conventional HIS mice harbor important limitations for accurately modeling LAV-induced immunity, such as limited human hematopoiesis, improper immune priming and hampered adaptive response. Over the past five years, novel HIS mice have been developed and now demonstrate a superior ability to mount potent innate and adaptive immune responses against immunogens and pathogens [14,15,16,17,18]. These emerging models, and future ones to come, offer unprecedented opportunity to better understand how LAVs interact with the human immune system over time and space, at the site of infection and in secondary lymphoid tissues.",

            "text": "Smallpox was a deadly disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years until its eventual eradication in 1980 [1,48]. The disease was caused by the virus variola from the Orthopovirus genus and poxvirus family, and had a case fatality rate of 30% [49]. Variolation, or infection with material from smallpox pustules or scabs, was practiced in China and India for thousands of years before its introduction into Europe in the 1790s [19,20,21,22,23,24,50]. Although variolation was safer than the contraction of smallpox itself, it had a 1% chance of mortality even if executed correctly [9]. While it was commonly known that those who contracted cowpox (a zoonotic poxvirus closely related to variola that only induced mild disease in humans) did not contract smallpox, deliberate inoculation with the virus was not popularized until the experiments of Edward Jenner were published in 1798. Jenner\u2019s findings summoned a wave of enthusiasm for what would eventually be termed \u2018vaccination\u2019 but issues with using cowpox as a LAV, which included bacterial contamination and unmeasured potency, caused vaccination support to wane. Early vaccines were made of lymph from infected calves or were propagated between vaccinees, but arm-to-arm transfer was considered unsafe because of the spread of bloodborne diseases [49]. A virus closely related to cowpox and variola known as vaccinia took the place of cowpox as the source of smallpox LAVs by 1900 through what may have also been contamination or the result of varied methods of virus passage [51].

Temperature stabilization through freeze drying [53] and the invention of a bifurcated needle [54] allowed the vaccine to be transported over greater distances and administered more efficiently. LAV enhancements, along with the lack of an animal reservoir for the disease, made smallpox a prime candidate for global eradication. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Smallpox Eradication Program in 1959 [51]. Many vaccine strains were used in this program, but some of the most commonly used LAVs were Dryvax and EM-63, derived from the NYCBH strain, Elstree of the Lister strain, and Tiantan of the Temple of Heaven Strain [51].

Apart from an M. tuberculosis contamination that resulted in the L\u00fcbeck disaster in 1930, which killed 72 infants and infected an additional 135 of 250 infants vaccinated [71], BCG administration became widespread without ill effect, and multiple strains were thus developed [70].

In recent years, the immunogenicity of the BCG LAV has been studied to a greater extent and appears to vary based on age at the time of vaccination, location, and previous exposure to mycobacteria or infection [72,73,74,75]. Statistical analyses of efficacy studies show that the BCG vaccine is most effective in providing protection against severe extrapulmonary (non-lung) forms of pediatric TB, but is unreliable in its protection of adults against pulmonary TB [72]. However, despite its variable efficacy, the BCG vaccine has been incredibly beneficial, and prevented an estimated 45 million deaths in HIV-negative individuals and 9 million HIV-positive individuals between 2010 and 2017 alone [65].",

The first isolations of YFV were obtained through serial passage of the serum of infected individuals, Francois Mayali and Asibi, in rhesus macaques [83,84]. The isolation from Mayali was used by the Pasteur Institute to develop the French Neurotropic Vaccine strain (FNV), but was discontinued in 1982 due to a number of encephalitic reactions to the vaccine [10]. The YFV-Asibi strain was isolated and passaged by Max Theiler of the Rockefeller Institute, and was successfully attenuated in 1927 after 235\u2013240 passages in mouse embryonic tissue, minced whole-chick embryo, and minced chick embryo with brain and spinal cord removed [32]. This LAV caused mild disease in macaques and human cohorts and conferred protective immunity against YFV [85]. This strain is known as YFV-17D and is the basis of all YFV vaccines used today [86].",

YFV-17D and derived LAVs are renowned for their safety, potency, and immunogenic properties. YFV-17D vaccines provide effective immunity in 80\u2013100% of vaccinees 10 days after vaccination, and more than 99% of vaccinees within 30 days of vaccination [87,88]. The incidence of serious adverse events, such as vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) and vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD), remains extremely low [9].

Since 2016, cases of YF in nonendemic areas or areas with less prevalence of YF have increased [82]. The reason for the spread of YFV to these areas is unknown, but could be the result of increased human activity in ecosystems where sylvatic cycles of YFV transmission occur, or due to a widening range of favorable habitats for YFV-carrying mosquitoes to travel due to climate change [82]. With no antiviral treatment in existence for YF, and an existing reservoir for the disease in nonhuman primates, it is critical that vaccination in areas experiencing YF outbreaks remains consistent [79]. However, the shortage of YFV-17D vaccines has led to the use of factional doses of vaccine. These doses (ranging between 1:2 to 1:170 of the original dose) can induce neutralizing antibodies that remain detectable from one to up to eight years post vaccination [89]. It is unclear, however, whether the long-term immunity lesser doses provide will be comparable to full LAV doses at a global scale. As YF reemerges in nonendemic areas, effective surveillance protocols and adequate vaccine stockpiles will be key for preventing future outbreaks.",

            "text": "Measles is a highly contagious illness produced by the negative-sense RNA measles virus (MV) of the family Paramyxoviridae, and is transmitted through respiration or aerosol [90]. Prior to the licensure of a vaccine in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years and caused 2.6 million deaths annually [91]. MV was first isolated in tissue culture by Enders and Peebles in 1954 using samples from an infected child named David Edmonston [34]. The virus was propagated on primary human kidney and amnion cells and attenuated through passages in chick embryos and chick embryo fibroblasts. This process gave rise to Edmonston A and B strains [34,90]. While Edmonston A was too reactogenic for vaccination use, Edmonston B was licensed as an LAV in 1963, with further attenuation through five additional passages on chick embryo fibroblasts at 36\u201337 \u00b0C [9]. The reactogenicity of measles LAV (MV-LAV) led to the creation of further attenuated strains, such as AIK-C from the original Edmonston strain [92], Schwarz from Edmonston A [93], and Edmonston Zagreb [94] and Moraten [95] from the Edmonston B strain. Approaches to developing these strains involved further passage in chick cell culture [93], passage in chick cell culture at elevated [95] or lowered temperatures [92], and passage in human diploid fibroblasts [94]. Independent measles strains such as CAM 70 [96], Leningrad 4 [97], Changchun 47 and Shanghai 191 [98] were also produced. All MV-LAV cause fevers and a rash to some extent, but most side effects are mild and short-lived [9]. Safe, effective, and affordable MV-LAVs have had a profound effect on the disease: between 2000 and 2017, the incidence of measles decreased by 83%, and deaths due to measles fell by 80% [99]. ",

Poliomyelitis became prevalent in the turn of the 20th century, instigating epidemiological studies that helped to characterize the virus and its pathogenesis [101]. The pathogenic theory of poliovirus was disrupted by a purely neurological view (due to the motor neuron infection that results in the disease of poliomyelitis) [9], but this was disproved by Sabin and other scientists in the 1950s [102,103,104]. Complete immunity to poliovirus requires vaccination with LAV derived from its three serotypes [101]. The LAVs used against poliovirus are derived from the Sabin type 1, 2, and 3 vaccine strains developed in 1954, and originate from parental strains Mahoney, P712, and Leon, respectively [33]. The attenuation of these strains was achieved through tissue culture passage in a variety of cell types as well as intracerebral passage in the case of P712 [9,105]. Following serial passage of each serotype, Sabin selected the most successful derivatives of Mahoney, P712, and Leon through neurovirulence testing in monkeys [33]. The live oral polio vaccine (OPV) was licensed in 1963 [9].",

The OPV has played a critical role in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative that began in 1988, decreasing the global burden of wild-type polio from more than 350,000 annual cases to just 33 cases in 2018 [108,109]. Wild-type 2 poliovirus was last seen in 1999 and declared eradicated in 2015 [110], and wild-type 3 poliovirus was declared eradicated in October of 2019 [111]. Despite these successes, any cases of polio pose a global health risk. On rare occasions, OPV can revert to a neurovirulent phenotype and induce vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, and virus excretion following vaccination can lead to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) [9]. While cVDPVs can be controlled by consistent vaccination, long-term virus excretion by hypogammaglobulinemic vaccinees, known as immunodeficient vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) is more difficult to manage [9]. The WHO and partners have introduced the Polio Endgame Strategy of 2019 to 2023, with the aim of wild-type and vaccine-derived polio eradication with the use of bivalent OPVs and IPVs [109].",

However, their attenuation and immunogenicity originated through a purely empiric process rather than from rational engineering and development. Whether a LAV was isolated from a related pathogen and propagated in various ways, or attenuated through serial passage, the environment in which a pathogen is grown influences its evolutionary path and therefore alters aspects of its infectious cycle. For this reason, the origin of vaccinia, the basis of the smallpox LAV, is lost to history. Prior to the eradication of smallpox, attempts to recreate a vaccinia-like LAV through the passage of the variola virus major or minor in embryonated eggs, tissue culture, and mice, were unsuccessful [124]. Additionally, even when methods of LAV passage are described in detail, as in the case of YFV-17D [32], recreation of the vaccine is not always possible. The future of LAV generation, therefore, cannot be empiric; it must stem from a well-developed understanding of the differential host\u2013pathogen interactions LAVs and virulent pathogens\u2019 display.

For example, cases of vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and increased neurovirulence are associated with mutations in the 5\u2019 noncoding region of all three OPV strains after passage in the human gastrointestinal tract [125,126]. Interestingly, besides vaccinia virus-derived smallpox LAV and deliberately reassortant LAIV, LAVs tend to show high genetic similarity to the pathogen they were derived from. YFV-17D and YFV-Asibi only diverge by 68 nucleotides (about 0.6% of the genome) and 32 amino acid changes that are scattered throughout the genome [127]. Additionally, Edmonston-derived MV-LAV have been shown to differ from the Edmonston strain at most by 0.3% [128], and the RD1, a 9.5 kb deletion seen in all BCG LAVs [129], accounts for only very little of the 4,345,492 bp genome of M. bovis [130]. Genetic variation between LAV strains can, however, complicate extrapolation from these data. In addition to the 9.5 kb RD1 deletion, further attenuated BCG LAV strains can have additional deletions, namely RD2 (10.7 kb) and/or RD3 (9.3 kb) [129]. ",

            "text": "Description of genetic differences alone can hardly explain the effects they have on host\u2013pathogen interaction and immune regulations. Therefore, a large body of research on molecular mechanisms governing LAV attenuation has been conducted in vitro. LAVs have, for instance, been found to differ in cell entry mechanisms in comparison to their virulent counterpart. Enhanced CD46 receptor utilization by MV-LAV has been described and is influenced by mutations in the hemagglutinin (H) protein [131,132]. YFV-17D and YFV-Asibi also exhibit distinctive usages of cell entry pathways and cell surface molecules, which were associated with differential viral spread and cell\u2013intrinsic-immune-response induction [133,134]. Differences in viral replication and cytokine induction have also been observed in cell culture. YFV-17D replicates more extensively than YFV-Asibi in hepatoma cell lines [135,136,137]. However, YFV-Asibi causes a stronger and more sustained pro-inflammatory response than YFV-17D [138,139,140] in primary human vascular endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, MDMs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). The Sabin type 3 OPV displays genetic differences from poliovirus type 3 that decrease the binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) at its viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Lower PTB binding to Sabin type 3 OPV IRES impaired protein translation in neurons, and was suggested to mediate viral attenuation in the central nervous system [141]. Finally, reduced YFV-17D replication in dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro has been suggested to promote antigen presentation in the lymph nodes (LN) by preventing DC apoptosis [142,143]. Unlike YFV-Asibi, the replication of YFV-17D in MoDCs also stimulates IFN\u03b3 production in CD4+T cells [140]. Another interesting concept for explaining LAV attenuation relies upon the genetic stability of these pathogens. For instance, YFV-17D is poorly prone to diversify into multiple quasi-species in comparison to YFV-Asibi, and YFV-Asibi diversification is not associated with the emergence of attenuation mutations [144]. A more recent study reported that YFV-17D has a stronger resistance to mutations, and suggested that YFV attenuation could be related to a higher fidelity of the YFV-17D replication complex [145]. ",

To this end, animal models have been used to conduct research in vivo. For instance, RD1 deletion of BCG LAVs was reported to prevent the cytolysis produced by early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) and decreases tissue invasiveness in mouse models [146]. Mice defective for type I interferon signaling have been employed to explore the mechanisms of YFV-17D attenuation and immunogenicity. Humoral and CD4+ T cell responses, but not the CD8+ T cell responses, were found to be critical for YFV-induced protection [147]. IFN-\u03b3 responses were also reported to restrict the dissemination of YFV-17D, but not YFV-Asibi, in mice [148,149]. Beyond mice, NHPs have also served to investigate the impact of cell-culture adapted mutations on viral virulence and inflammatory responses. The passage of a pathogenic wild-type MV (Davis87-wt) in Vero cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts led to the emergence of several adaptive mutations that resulted in attenuated clinical symptoms in rhesus macaques [150]. Interestingly, a back-to-back comparison of early transcriptomic responses during YFV-17D and -Asibi infection was conducted in rhesus macaques. The number of differentially expressed genes in peripheral mononuclear cells was higher upon YFV-Asibi than YFV-17D infection, and expression changes were mostly connected with the dysregulation of immune responses and apoptosis. In contrast, gene expression changes during YFV-17D infection were mainly linked to innate immunity [151]. ",

            "text": "Although agreement has been found between in vivo and in vitro studies, discrepancies have also arisen. Sabin type 1 OPV is attenuated in vitro upon exposure to high temperatures (>37 \u00b0C), unlike its parental strain, Mahoney. However, genetic determinants of temperature sensitivity do not contribute to viral attenuation in transgenic mouse models [152,153]. Additionally, while most NYCBH-derived LAV strains examined by Lee et al. replicated to wild-type levels in vitro, their replication in mouse epithelium differed greatly from wild-type vaccinia virus, and their immunogenic effect was dose-dependent [154]. Other categories of discrepancies have also been reported. For instance, the route of administration seems to affect virus protein roles during vaccinia virus infection [155], or BCG-induced immune responses in NHPs [156]. Moreover, multiple studies have found greater IFN production in MV-LAV strains [157,158,159,160,161], but the potential presence of 5\u2019 copy-back defective interfering (DI) RNAs in laboratory virus stocks, which increase interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) levels (among multiple other effects), may have confounded previous results [162]. Disparities between in vivo models have also been observed. Mice defective for type I interferon signaling have been suggested to be a relevant system to investigate YFV-17D-induced protective immunity [147]. However, an important number of genes upstream and downstream of the type I interferon signaling pathways are upregulated upon YFV-17D vaccination in humans [163]. Furthermore, although the authors reported that mouse CD8+ T cells do not contribute to protection in mice defective for type I interferon signaling, multiple studies have described the critical mobilization of human CD8+ T cells toward the robust effector and memory phenotypes during YFV-17D vaccination in human vaccinees [164,165,166,167]. Finally, discrepancies have also been observed in the cytokine response of human and rhesus macaques MoDCs upon YFV-17D infection [140]. ",

            "text": "LAV attenuation is a multi-faceted and complex topic. The history of LAV passage is varied and mosaic, and the efficacious products we are left with are near impossible to trace to their roots. Our understanding of LAV attenuation appears to be mainly restricted to either genetic changes upstream of the vaccination process, or to immune correlates downstream of vaccination (such as antibody production). However, the immunological mechanisms and host\u2013pathogen interactions that govern attenuation during vaccination remain uncharted. To explore these mechanisms, the choice of the right experimental system is of critical importance, as is exemplified by the instances of disagreement described above. An accurate understanding of LAV-induced immunity is therefore fully reliant on a suitable in vivo model, able to recapitulate human immunity to LAVs.

            "text": "Mouse models have been truly transformative for our understanding of human immunology and will very likely continue to be [198]. Although they have served as a model organism to investigate anti-LAV immunity and evaluate LAV candidates in vivo [134,146,147,148,149,153,154,155,183,184,193,194,199,200,201], important limitations and concerns have stalled their use for this purpose. Despite sharing many physiologic and metabolic processes, mouse and man diverged evolutionarily more than 96 million years ago [202]. This evolutionary divergence has differentially shaped the architecture of the immune system of both species, therefore leading to important differences in how each organism mobilizes its immune system to fight a given disease [203]. There are numerous immunological differences between mice and humans, such as differences in immune cell composition in the blood, differences in the spatiotemporal expression of many immune proteins and receptors (pattern recognition receptors, cluster of differentiation, immunoglobulin, Fc receptors, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) etc.), differences in hematopoiesis, and differences in cytokine function [203]. As we aim to investigate anti-LAV immunity at the highest possible resolution, translating immunological mechanisms from mice to humans becomes perilous. Moreover, many viral and bacterial pathogens display a very narrow host tropism, often being restricted to humans and specific primate species. For example, the natural resistance of mice to viral pathogens such as MV, YFV, dengue virus, Ebola virus or Zika virus adds an additional layer of limitations to conventional mouse models. ",

            "text": "NHPs have been useful resources for studying anti-LAV immunity as well as evaluating novel LAV candidates. Especially, macaques have been intensively used to evaluate the immunogenicity of LAV strategies targeting human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). However, HIV-1\u2014like several other human-tropic viruses\u2014is a virus that replicates poorly in NHP species. Therefore, many LAV strategies have been evaluated in NHPs using live-attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [204,205,206,207,208,209], the simian version of HIV-1 that only replicates in NHP species. Additional strategies employing HIV-1 related viruses [210,211] or engineered viruses harboring HIV-1 or SIV antigens [212,213] have also been tested in NHPs. NHPs have also been employed to investigate and/or evaluate the immunogenicity of many other LAVs, such as viral vectors harboring Ebola virus glycoproteins [214,215,216,217,218], LAIV [195], OPV [189,190], MV-LAV [150,185,197,219,220,221], BCG [156], live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus [222], YFV-17D [151] or live-attenuated Zika virus [43]. NHP models for LAV research, however, present significant limitations. First, a pathogen with a strictly restricted human tropism imposes the use of surrogate pathogens and/or a host environment that is not naturally permissive to the human pathogen that is targeted. Second, NHP studies are costly, require complicated logistics, and adequate reagents that are of limited availabilities. Finally, whether NHP cell-intrinsic innate immune responses differ from those of humans during antigen stimulation is unclear and may depend on the experimental context [140,223,224]. Therefore, although it is certain that NHPs represent an invaluable system for LAV investigation and development, they need to be complemented with more cost-effective and accessible models that allow for the monitoring of human-specific immune responses and human\u2013pathogen-specific interactions.

For instance, studies have identified specific cellular, transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures defining LAV immunogenicity in the blood of human vaccinees [164,166,225,226,227,228], providing unique insights into how the immune response is mobilized upon LAV vaccination in humans. However, these studies fall short of probing fundamental mechanisms that govern LAV attenuation and immunogenicity for several reasons. First, human cohort studies are often restricted to the analysis of the peripheral immune response. The upstream immunological events that occur at the site of vaccination and in draining lymph nodes, and with them the critical pathogens\u2013host interactions that prime the immune system toward a specific direction, remain inaccessible in human vaccinees. Second, capturing key immunological mechanisms and regulations that define immunogenicity require the performance of a back-to-back comparison of the immune responses induced by a given LAV and the virulent strain it is derived from or related to. However, for obvious ethical reasons, this is not possible in a cohort of human patients. Finally, more and more studies have provided evidence that age, immunological history and microbiota status can influence immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. Therefore, identifying the immunological regulations that define a specific immune response to an LAV, independently of inter-individual variations that may impact such responses, remains a very complex task.",

In 1983, a mouse harboring the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mutation, a mutation in the Prkdc gene, was reported to lack functional B and T cells through defective V(D)J recombination [229]. In 1992, mice defective for expression of the two recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2, were also reported to display no functional T and B cells through a similar mechanism [230,231]. In the late 1980s, the transplantation of adult SCID mice with fetal human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and tissues [232] or peripheral blood leukocytes, led to the differentiation of human T and B cells in vivo [233]. Human HSC engraftment of bg/mu/xid mice was also reported at the same period. These animals were athymic and had lower levels of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). Intravenous inoculation of human bone-marrow-derived cells into adult irradiated bg/mu/xid mice led to the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs into macrophage progenitors in vivo [234]. Engraftment in these animals led to a higher number of progenitors than in SCID mice, likely due to the absence of NK and LAK activity in bg/mu/xid mice. ",

However, engraftment levels still remained low. In 1995\u20131996, SCID mice built within the non-obese diabetic (NOD)-background were identified to support higher level of HSC engraftment in comparison to previously tested genetic backgrounds [236,237,238]. Around ten years later, the underlying mechanism of this superior engraftment was found to be related to a polymorphism in the Sirpa allele [239]. NOD SIRP\u03b1, a cell surface receptor expressed at the surface of macrophages and encoded by the Sirpa allele, displays significant similarities with the human one in comparison to those expressed by mice of other genetic backgrounds. This similarity allows NOD mouse macrophages to bind to human CD47 and, therefore, to recognize human hematopoietic cells as \u2018self\u2019. ",

IL2R\u03b3 is a receptor for multiple cytokines such as IL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15 and 21. Disruption of IL-15-mediated signaling induces severe deficiencies in NK cell development and maturation, leading to a more severe immunodeficiency and more permissive environment for human HSC engraftment in adult RAG2-/- supplemented or unsupplemented by the exogenous administration of human cytokines [241,242], and in adult NOD-SCID mice [243]. Another important step that followed was the demonstration that the intrahepatic injection of human CD34+ cells into newborn Rag2\u2212/\u2212 IL2R\u03b3null and NOD-SCID IL2R\u03b3null mice led to the induction of low, albeit significant, functional adaptive responses in these mice [244,245], which opened the door to novel investigations of human immunity in vivo. An alternative model to the NOD-SCID IL2R\u03b3null mice, namely NOD-SCID JAK3null, has also been reported. In this model, JAK3, a gene encoding for a tyrosine kinase critical for IL2R\u03b3-mediated signaling is knocked-out instead of IL2R\u03b3, resulting in a complete lack of B, T and NK cells [246].",

            "text": "A initial approach has been to generate HIS mice expressing transgenic MHC molecules to educate human T cells in the mouse thymus and to track human antigen-specific T cells upon microbial challenge [271,272,273,274]. However, a more elaborate strategy has involved the construction of HIS mice engrafted with human primary lymphoid tissue in order to more physiologically model human hematopoiesis and lymphocyte education. In 1990, an introductory study reported that the co-engraftment of small fragments of the fetal liver and thymus into adult SCID mice (also referred as the SCID-hu model) led to the long-term maintenance of several human hematopoietic progenitors and to sustained human T lymphopoiesis [275]. About 16 years later, HIS mice co-engrafted with human HSCs and small pieces of fetal liver and thymus (namely bone marrow-liver-thymus mice or BLT mice) were generated using the NOD/SCID background [276,277], and later in the NSG background [278]. In these studies, BLT-HIS mice were shown to display enhanced lymphopoiesis and T-cell selection on human MHC molecules. BLT-HIS mice have notably constituted a model of choice to investigate the infectious cycle of HIV-1 in vivo, as mucosal infection, persistent viremia and cellular responses\u2014albeit limited\u2014could be recapitulated in this model [279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287]. BLT-HIS mice have also been a useful system to investigate the replication dynamics of the Dengue virus (DENV) in vivo, as well as anti-DENV adaptive immunity [288,289,290,291,292]. However, a major limitation of the BLT model is its absolute reliance on fetal tissues. Therefore, alternative approaches involving the engraftment of immunodeficient mouse strains with embryonic stem cell-derived, thymic epithelial progenitors [293], or with neonatal thymus [294], have been recently proposed.

IL2R\u03b3null immunodeficient mice are defective for IL-7-mediated signaling, which results into the absence of lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTi) during development [305,306]. Interestingly, the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) shares a structural and functional homology with IL-7 but signals through a receptor that is IL2R\u03b3 independent. It has been recently shown that TSLP overexpression compensates for the lack of IL-7 signaling and promotes robust LN development in BRG-hSirpa mice (BRGST) [307]. Even though such secondary lymphoid structures cannot be completely considered a human microenvironment per se, mouse LNs were effectively repopulated with human hematopoietic cells in BRG mice [307]. They provided a suitable niche for human T- and B- cell priming after immunization, leading to enhanced human antigen-specific responses. An alternative approach for restoring mouse LN has also been reported [308]. NOG mice harboring a transgene coding for murine IL2R\u03b3 under the control of the endogenous promoter of ROR\u03b3t were generated (NOG-pROR\u03b3t-\u03b3c), allowing the selective re-expression of IL2R\u03b3 in a specific LTi lineage [308]. As with BRGST mice, this model was able to mount enhanced antigen-specific IgG responses. ",

Engraftment protocols are composed of several variables which mainly include: the source of HSC, engraftment of fetal tissues (or not), mouse age, transplantation route, sex, and conditioning [11]. Although some engraftment protocols are widely used across several strains of HIS mice and can interrogate many biological processes, other protocols (which, for instance, include the engraftment of additional human tissues or matrices) can be more specific to certain strains and biological questions. Therefore, in addition to the HIS mouse strain that is used, it is important to understand the characteristics of the engraftment protocol that is employed to make sure that it will be appropriate for a given investigation.

However, very limited studies have employed these systems to evaluate the efficacy and safety of attenuation strategies for HIV-1. One study reported a HIV-1 strain (HIV-rTA) for which the TAT-Tar mechanism required for virus replication and transcription was inactivated and the viral protein Nef was replaced by a doxycycline-dependent transcription system [318]. Authors showed that HIV-rTA could lead to production infection in doxycycline-fed BRG-HIS mice without CD4+ T cell depletion. Importantly, the virus was not found to escape doxycycline control over time and revert toward a wild type TAT-tar mechanism [318]. A few years later, a second version of the same virus expressing a ubiquitin-processed rTA-Ub-Nef cassette (HIV-rTA-Ub-Nef) was found to replicate more effectively in NSG-HIS mice than HIV-rTA without impacting the CD4+ T cell count [319]. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that HIS mice represent a useful system to evaluate the replication kinetics and safety of live-attenuated lymphotropic viruses that have a very narrow tropism.

HIS mice\u2019s susceptibility to MV-LAV has been used to evaluate vaccine reversion and stability over time. Specifically, CB17-SCID-hu mice were employed to investigate whether long-term passages of an avirulent measles vaccine strain (Moraten strain) could cause enhanced virulence and thymic tissue adaptation over time [321]. Interestingly, the Moraten strain, collected 90 days post vaccination from the thymus of CB17-SCID-hu mice, showed high virulence in thymus implants in comparison to the original Moraten strain.

Indeed, although NRG mice engrafted with murine HSCs (NRG-MIS) were not permissive to infection, the reconstitution of NRG mice with human hematopoietic cells led to persistent infection in the peripheral blood and in the spleen, demonstrating a preferential tropism of YFV-17D for human cells. By tracking viral RNA into multiple subsets of the human immune system, we were able to probe the cellular tropism of YFV-17D over time and space in multiple human hematopoietic lineages. Using NRG-HIS mice and mice depleted for Stat1 signaling in the hematopoietic compartment, we also identified species-specific interactions between YFV-17D and this compartment that potentially regulate the outcome of infection. Altogether, this work provided important evidence that HIS mice can serve as a unique system to define the dynamics of interactions between LAVs and components of the human immune system over time and space.

In 2008, Yu et al. reported the use of NSG-HIS mouse models engrafted with HLA-A*0201 HSC, then treated with hFlt3L and reinjected with autologous T cells prior to vaccination with a trivalent influenza LAV. Following vaccination, LAIV-CD8+ T cells targeting an HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from the influenza matrix protein (FluM1) and nonstructural protein 1 were found to expand in the blood, spleen and lungs, underscoring the successful adaptive immune priming in this model [322]. Importantly, priming was reported to be myeloid-dependent, which highlights the critical need of a myeloid compartment in HIS mice for modeling anti-LAV immunity. In a follow-up study, the same authors identified that CD1c+ dendritic cells induce the differentiation and accumulation of mucosal effector CD103+ CD8+ T cells in a TGF\u03b2-dependent manner in the lung following LAIV vaccination [323]. Finally, in a third publication, they identified CD141+ dendritic cells as the major driver of the establishment of the Th2 response in the lung upon LAIV infection, by promoting the differentiation of IL-3- and IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells through the OX40 ligand [324]. Overall, these studies demonstrate that HIS mice can be successfully employed to uncover immunological mechanisms regulating T cell priming and differentiation in relevant tissues during LAV infection.",

Following aerosol infection, pulmonary lesions and necrotic granulomas displaying similarities with those observed in patients could be observed. Authors also demonstrated the relevance of such an infection model to evaluate drug regimens against M. tuberculosis in vivo. In another study, NRG-HIS mice were immunized subcutaneously with the BCG vaccine and then challenged four weeks later with M. tuberculosis via the respiratory route. BCG was able to partially protect NRG-HIS mice against M. tuberculosis infection, as demonstrated by a reduced bacterial load and granulomatous lesions in the lungs. The authors therefore concluded that HIS mice can represent a relevant platform to evaluate novel vaccinal strategies against M. tuberculosis, a method that they further implemented by testing a novel adenoviral-vectored (VV) vaccine expressing an immunodominant M. tuberculosis antigen [326]. The same year, an additional study from a different group reported the analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotypes (through their expression of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-2) in NOG-HIS mice upon M. tuberculosis infection, as well as BCG vaccination prior to M. tuberculosis infection [327]. These authors found evidence of potential T-cell activation upon M. tuberculosis challenge in the lungs, and further suggested that BCG vaccination affects the distribution of T-cell activation phenotypes in the same tissue upon subsequent M. tuberculosis infection. However, unlike the previous study, authors did not find that BCG could confer any level of protection against M. tuberculosis in NOG-HIS mice, in contrast to C57BL/6 mice and Hartley guinea pigs, where partial protection was observed [327]. Altogether, these studies highlight that HIS mice have potential in uncovering the molecular basis of BCG-induced immunity. However, they also underscore the need for more advanced HIS mouse models able to more accurately and reproducibly recapitulate human BCG-induced immunity. ",

            "text": "Previous studies using conventional HIS mice have demonstrated the importance of the myeloid compartment in HIS mice for accurately investigating anti-LAV immunity. More recently, we reported NRGF-HIS mice (see Section \u2018Cytokine Environment and Niche Space\u2019 for model description) and NRGF-HIS mice expressing transgenic HLA-A*0201 (NFA2-HIS) as a new HIS mouse model for investigating YFV-17D-induced immunity [17]. In this model, the adenovirus-mediated expressing of hFLT3L promotes the selective expansion of human dendritic cells, myeloid cells and granulocytes, unlike in conventional NRG, NSG or BRG mice, where hFLT3L expression/injection leads to the expansion of both the human and murine myeloid compartment. Although this might not be an issue for all LAVs, the mouse interferon response has been shown to strongly restrict YFV-17D infection in mouse models of infection [148,328,329], in contrast to humans, where YFV-17D can overcome such a response. Therefore, hFLT3L-mediated expansion of the myeloid compartment in conventional HIS mouse strains can lead to important immune interference between the mouse and human hematopoietic compartment. Unlike conventional NRG-HIS mice (in which the human myeloid compartment is not expanded), we found that NFA2-HIS mice can mount a peripheral transcriptomic response upon YFV-17D that shared key similarities with the response observed in human vaccinees [17]. NFA2-HIS mice were consistently able to mount a YFV-17D-specific CD8+ T cell response as well as an YFV-17D-IgG response, which led to the clearance of viral RNA in the peripheral blood, unlike in conventional NRG-HIS mice where infection persist over time in periphery. This work demonstrates the strong potential of second-generation HIS mice and emerging models to uncover fundamental immunological processes regulating adaptive immune priming in vivo and in a human context, and therefore sheds light on the elusive mechanisms governing LAV-induced protective immunity.",

Therefore, although conventional HIS mice have been considered satisfying enough to study specific immunological processes during virulent pathogen infection, investigating LAV-induced immunity requires models able to mount polyfunctional, potent and long-lasting responses that involve multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, conventional HIS mice, like NOD-SCID, NRG, NSG/NOG or BRG, display major caveats such as low myeloid engraftment, a lack of important lymphoid tissues and the absence of a proper lymphocyte education, therefore making these models poorly suitable to investigate LAV-induced immunity.",

However, current HIS mice used for LAV research lack functional secondary lymphoid structures because of defective IL7-mediated signaling (See section \u2018Human Microenvironment and Lymphocyte Education\u2019). This suggests that immune priming in HIS mice upon LAV infection is either extremely limited when using an intra-muscular route, or occurs in irrelevant tissue context when using other routes of infection (priming will mostly occur in the spleen if using an intravenous route of infection). Several strategies have been suggested and/or reported to generate HIS mice with LN which include, among other cytokine-mediated restorations of mouse LN [307,308], engraftment of ex-vivo generated human artificial LN [333], or direct engraftment of human LN [334]. HIS mice models combining functional LN structures, primary lymphoid human tissues or human MHC class I and II expression, as well as an enhanced myeloid-NK compartment could represent a fantastic resource for LAV research (Figure 3). Such models would open major avenues to a new ranges of studies where human immunological mechanisms governing LAV immunogenicity and attenuation could be decrypted in a relevant tissue and cellular context, and in a way that is not possible in human vaccinees.

The liver is known to host several immune functions such as IL-6 production, secretion of acute phase proteins, and the production of complement or Kupffer-cell mediated immune regulation [337]. Therefore, it is likely that the immune function of the liver could synergize with those of the immune system when co-engrafted in refined HIS mouse models such as the one described above (Figure 3).

A recent study conducted in human vaccinees notably found that antibiotic treatment impairs IgA and IgG responses to H1N1 following influenza vaccination [339], suggesting that particular bacterial species can modulate adaptive responses to vaccines. HIS mice present a significant advantage over humans for the study of the microbiota as their microbiome can be easily tracked and manipulated throughout the animal\u2019s life. Protocols have been recently developed to generate HIS mice engrafted with human microbiota [340], and few preliminary studies have been conducted in conventional HIS mouse models [341]. As we approach the role of the microbiota in regulating human health, the development of innovative HIS mouse models able to mount superior adaptive responses and co-engrafted with human microbiota would open notable opportunities to investigate LAV-induced immunity in a more relevant physiological context and to better understand microbiota-mediated regulation of immune priming (Figure 3).
