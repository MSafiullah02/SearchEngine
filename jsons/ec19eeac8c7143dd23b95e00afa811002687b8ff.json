The prevalence of this virus has been studied in several sites worldwide. We conducted the first clinical and molecular study of HBoV in Taiwan at the Centers for Diseases Control, Taiwan. Objectives: To investigate the genomic and epidemiologic profiles of HBoV infection in Taiwan. Study design: Throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Specimens negative for other respiratory viruses by molecular screening were examined for HBoV. Results: HBoV was the only virus detected in 30 (5.6%) of 531 samples. Of these positive cases, 56.7% were from children less than 2 years old. Two groups of HBoV co-circulated in Taiwan during the study. Results of evolutionary networks evaluation suggest that HBoV might have had an opportunity for interbreeding of viruses and genetic recombinations among the different genes. Conclusion: HBoV may have circulated in Taiwan for some time and it appears to be one of the etiological agents responsible for lower respiratory tract infection in children.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human Bocavirus (HBoV), currently classified in the genus Bocavirus within the family Parvoviridae, was first described in 2005 after large-scale molecular screening of respiratory specimens for virus genome sequences led to its discovery. 1 The etiologic role of HBoV in the causation of respiratory illness is not clearly defined due to lack of viral propagation techniques in cell culture or animal models. 1 However, many studies have reported finding this virus associated with respiratory tract infections, especially in infants and young children. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The virus has been reported worldwide, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] with incidence rates determined by nucleic acid amplification ranging from 3 to 19%. 7, [12] [13] [14] [15] Recently, the virus has also been identified in blood and faecal samples. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] Epidemiological data reported in most previous studies have been generated using the NP1 gene for HBoV detection. However, the complete coding sequence of this virus in the database is incomplete, and thus, the true prevalence of the virus may be slightly underestimated. 1 In order to better understand the genomic and epidemiological profiles of HBoV infection in Taiwan, we examined specimens from pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).

Analysis of the nucleotide sequences encoding the complete genome (positions 1-5262) of Taiwanese strains showed that most of strains were genetically close to ST1 or ST2 (GenBank accession number DQ0000495 and DQ0000496, identified by Allander et al. 1 , with the phylogenetic tree clearly divided into two major groups (I and II) (Fig. 1A ) .

Furthermore, our findings indicate that the two different groups of HBoV identified in Taiwan are genetically distinct. One is remarkably similar to the initial strains of HBoV identified in Sweden and the other one is similar to the strain (CU74) detected in Thailand. Likelihood-mapping analysis suggests that each ORF may have some \"unresolved\" phylogenetic signal, and that NS1 may not be the best gene with which to construct a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees constructed by NJ and ML methods showed a similar topology. A monophyletic group with longer branch length consisted only of Taiwanese HBoV isolates suggests that this virus might have circulated in Taiwan for a certain period (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, computing the evolutionary networks from sequence data by applied splitstree software, 29 there appeared to be at least 2 networks among Asian strains ( Fig. 2A) . This finding suggests that the virus might have circulated simultaneously in several locations and that simultaneous infections with different strains might have occurred, resulting in an opportunity for interbreeding of virus and genetic recombination among the viral genes.
