The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students' socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received. Non-credible answers (e.g., year of birth after 2009, more than 20 hours of learning per day) were eliminated. The final dataset included 420 valid observations. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s ",

As a country that dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak very early and productively, Vietnam is a notable case study of instantaneous and conspicuous collaboration between the government and society [3] . However, the shift in the educational system was unforeseen and caused significant side effects [4] . This dataset [5] focused on the learning habits of 420 secondary students (Grade 6-12) in Hanoi during the first two weeks of school ",

Parents or teachers were required to complete the consent form before forwarding the URL to the student. A total of 460 responses were received, but only 420 valid observations were accepted for further analysis, due to the elimination of obviously invalid answers (e.g. more than 20 hours of learning per day).

Scholars have pointed out that SES factors such as monthly family income, parents' occupations, number of siblings, school type, and grade level have significant influences on students' learning habits [6 , 7] . This study complements the conventional notion of SES with additional variables about students' competencies. Specifically in the case of Vietnam, we added subjects for university entrance, which demonstrate students' occupational aspirations, and English, which is a crucial competency in today's world.",

In particular, students were asked their total hours of self-learning before and during COVID-19. With regard to the total number of learning hours during COVID-19, there were sub-questions about the total hours of off-line and online study modes, as well as the total hours of learning with instruction or without instruction from other people. Variables in group C were mainly designed for this specific data collection. All items in this section were measured using a five-point Likert scale (1: Totally Disagree, 5: Totally Agree). First, we examined students' perceptions on the necessity for self-learning during COVID-19. According to the literature on transformative learning, students' learning practices are influenced by their beliefs about learning and influences from teachers, parents, and peers [9] . Thus, we constructed the variable of \"students' necessity for self-learning\" using the following items: (i) to ensure my learning progress; (ii) to maintain my learning habits; (iii) influenced by teachers; (iv) influenced by parents; (v) influenced by siblings; (vi) influenced by friends. Second, we measured students' self-reports on factors that influence self-learning effectiveness. This variable consisted of different physical factors (the availability of learning resources [10] , learning space [11] ), psychological factors (self-motivation [12] , family support [13] ), and behavioural factors (concentration, goal setting [14] , communication and peer collaboration [15] ).",
