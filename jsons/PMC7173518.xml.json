The mechanisms, cells, and molecules involved in microorganism-intestinal interactions are numerous, increasingly complex, and only partially understood. A complete review of this topic is beyond the scope of this chapter; comprehensive reviews on intestinal immunity have been published [15,16], including specific reviews on dendritic cells [17], intestinal IgA [18], intestinal epithelial cells [19], microbial colonization [20], toll-like receptors [21], mast cells [22], and Paneth cells [23]. It is generally accepted that although most of the constituents required for an intestinal immune response against microorganisms are present in the neonatal gut, they are \u201cimmature,\u201d principally because neonates have not had the opportunity to develop local or systemic immune responses, and in the first few days of life, they have yet to acquire the highly important enteric microflora that protects the normal adult gastrointestinal (GI) tract [9,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. During the early neonatal period, there is a \u201crelative\u201d deficiency in antigen-presenting cell functions and altered cell-mediated immune responses [30]. Little is known about the barrier capabilities of the neonate's gastric acidity [30,31], intestinal mucus [30,32], or motility [33,34], each of which provides protection against GI tract infections in older infants, children, and adults.",

The buffering action of frequent milk feedings and the short gastric emptying time [[38], [39], [40], [41]] introduce additional factors in the neonate that would be expected to permit viable ingested organisms to reach the small intestine.",

The thick mucin-rich glycocalix surrounded by mucus forms a physical barrier embedded with antimicrobial peptides and enzymes [30]. The different composition of adult and neonatal glycocalix may influence susceptibility to colonization and infection [30]. Intestinal epithelial cells have receptors for bacterial products and produce chemokines (e.g., interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein type 1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1) in response to invasion by enteropathogens [43]. The gut epithelium orchestrates the immune response. Paneth cells in crypts express toll-like receptors activated by microorganisms leading to release of potent antimicrobial agents including lysozyme and cryptidins [44].",

Published studies reporting the association between breast-feeding and diarrhea are extensive and suggest that infants who are breast-fed have fewer episodes of diarrhea than infants who are formula-fed. This protection is greatest during an infant's first 3 months of life and declines with increasing age. During the period of weaning, partial breast-feeding confers protection that is intermediate between the protection gained by infants who are exclusively breast-fed and that by infants who are exclusively formula-fed.",

Despite extremely poor sanitation and the demonstration of fecal organisms in the colostrum and milk of almost one third of mothers [60], diarrheal disease did not occur in any of the newborns. The incidence of diarrhea increased significantly only after these infants reached 4 to 6 months old, at which time solids and other fluids were used to supplement the human milk feedings. At that time, Escherichia coli and gram-negative anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides species) were found to colonize the intestinal tract [9]. In contrast, urban infants of a similar ethnic background who were partly or totally artificially fed frequently acquired diarrheal disease caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). A more recent study among infants 0 to 3 months old from Bangladesh showed that breast-feeding provided significant protection against diarrheal disease with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.98) and respiratory disease with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.88) [61]. Protection afforded by breast-feeding against diarrhea during the first months of life has also been observed in more industrialized societies such as the United Kingdom [62].",

Redundancy of milk protective factors and targeting of complex virulence machinery have created a formidable barrier to enteropathogens. Despite the fact that pathogens can rapidly divide and mutate, milk continues to protect infants. Human milk has secretory antibodies to Shigella virulence antigens and lipopolysaccharides [66,67], neutral glycolipid Gb3 to bind Shiga toxin [68,69], and lactoferrin to disrupt and degrade the surface-expressed virulence antigens. Lactoferrin chelates iron, making it unavailable for bacterial metabolism; stimulates phagocytosis; and inhibits several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus [30,[70], [71], [72]]. In a similar way, milk contains antibodies directed toward the surface-expressed virulence antigens of EPEC [73], oligosaccharides that block EPEC cell attachment [74], and lactoferrin interference with EPEC surface factors [75]. Human milk can initiate and maintain the growth of Bifidobacterium species and low pH in the feces of newborn infants, creating an environment antagonistic to the growth of E. coli [9,27,28,76]. Lysozyme in human milk breaks \u03b21,4 bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, a critical linkage in the peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls [30].",

In 1960, Montreuil and Mullet [89] determined that oligosaccharides constituted 2.4% of colostrum and 1.3% of mature milk. Human milk contains a larger quantity of oligosaccharides than milk from other mammals, and its composition is singularly complex [90]. The metabolic fate of oligosaccharides is of interest. Only water, lactose, and lipids are present in greater amounts than oligosaccharides. Despite the fact that substantial energy must be expended by the mother to synthesize the many hundreds of different milk oligosaccharides, the infant does not use them as food. Most of the oligosaccharides pass through the gut undigested [91,92]. It is thought that they are present primarily to serve as receptor analogues that misdirect enteropathogen attachment factors away from gut epithelial carbohydrate receptors. Likewise, enteropathogens use the oligosaccharide portion of glycolipids and glycoproteins as targets for attachment of whole bacteria and toxins. Evidence is emerging that these glycoconjugates may have an important role in protection of the breast-fed infant from disease [64].",

Experiments have shown that EPEC attachment to HEp-2 laryngeal epithelial cells and HIV-1 binding to dendritic cell coreceptor DC-SIGN can be inhibited by purified oligosaccharide fractions from human milk [74].,93a Oligosaccharides also may be relevant to protection from Norwalk virus and other caliciviruses because these viruses attach to human ABO, Lewis, and secretor blood group antigens [94,95]. Human milk contains large amounts of these carbohydrates. The ganglioside fraction in human milk has been shown to inhibit the action of heat-labile toxin (LT) and cholera toxin on ileal loops more effectively than secretory IgA [96,97]. Lactadherin in human milk has been shown to bind rotavirus and to inhibit viral replication in vitro and in vivo [98]. A study of infants in Mexico showed that lactadherin in human milk protected infants from symptoms of rotavirus infection [87]. Free fatty acids and monoglyceride products of lingual and gastric lipase activity in human milk triglycerides may have antiviral and antiparasitic activity [30]. Human milk oligosaccharides also inhibit leukocyte endothelial adhesion and help explain the low rate of inflammatory disorders in breast-fed infants [98a].",

            "text": "The isolation of ETEC is uncommon in sporadic diarrheal illnesses in temperate climates where sanitation facilities are good and where winter viral patterns of diarrhea predominate. ETEC is commonly isolated from infants and children with acute watery summer diarrhea in areas where sanitary facilities are suboptimal [49,182,[191], [192], [193], [194], [195], [196], [197], [198], [199], [200], [201], [202], [203]], such as Africa [182], Brazil [49,191,197,202,203], Argentina [193], Bengal [194,195], Mexico [196], and Native American reservations in the southwestern United States [198,199]. In a multicenter study of acute diarrhea in 3640 infants and children in China, India, Mexico, Myanmar, and Pakistan, 16% of cases (versus 5% of 3279 controls) had ETEC [200]. A case-control study from northwestern Spain showed a highly significant association of ETEC with 26.5% of neonatal diarrhea, often acquired in the hospital [201]. Although all types of ETEC are associated with cholera-like, noninflammatory, watery diarrhea in adults in these areas, they probably also constitute the major cause (along with rotaviruses) of dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children in these areas. In this setting, peaks of illnesses tend to occur in the summer or rainy season, and dehydrating illnesses may be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children [49,197,202]. Humans are probably the major reservoirs for the human strains of ETEC, and contaminated food and water probably constitute the principal vectors [204,205]. Although antitoxic immunity to LT and asymptomatic infection with LT-producing E. coli tend to increase with age, ST is poorly immunogenic, and ST-producing E. coli continue to be associated with symptomatic illnesses into adulthood in endemic areas [199,203].",

In many parts of the developing world, acute diarrheal illnesses are the leading recognized causes of death. There is some suggestion that diarrheal illnesses associated with ST-producing ETEC may be particularly severe [195]. Probably the best definition of the clinical manifestations of ETEC infection comes from volunteer studies with adults. Ingestion of 108 to 1010 human ETEC isolates that produce LT and ST or ST alone resulted in a 30% to 80% attack rate of mild to moderate diarrheal illnesses within 12 to 56 hours that lasted 1 to 3 days [133]. These illnesses, typical for traveler's diarrhea, were manifested by malaise, anorexia, abdominal cramps, and sometimes explosive diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting occur relatively infrequently, and one third of patients may have a low-grade fever. Although illnesses usually resolve spontaneously within 1 to 5 days, they occasionally may persist for 1 week or longer. The diarrhea is noninflammatory, without fecal leukocytes or blood. In outbreaks in infants and neonates, the duration has been in the same range (1 to 11 days), with a mean of approximately 4 days.",

Widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics in areas where antimicrobial resistance is common has the potential for selecting for rather than against enterotoxigenic organisms. The prevention and control of ETEC infections are similar to those discussed under EPEC serotypes. Breast-feeding infants should be encouraged.

In this instance, it may be appropriate to have the fecal E. coli isolated and serotyped or tested for invasiveness in the Sereny test. Plasmid pattern analysis and chromosomal restriction endonuclease digestion pattern analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis have been used to evaluate strains involved in outbreaks [226].

Outbreaks have become rare in the United States and other industrialized countries, but they still occur [241]. Some researchers have attributed the rare recognition of illness in part to the declining severity of diarrheal disease caused by EPEC within the past 30 years, resulting in fewer cultures being obtained from infants with relatively mild symptoms [112,242]. Several other variables influence the apparent incidence of this disease in the community, however. A problem arises with false-positive EPEC identification on the basis of the nonspecific cross-reactions seen with improper shortening of the serotyping procedure [243,244]. Because of their complexity and relatively low yield, neither slide agglutination nor HEp-2 cell adherence or DNA probe tests are provided as part of the routine identification of enteric pathogens by most clinical bacteriology laboratories. Failure to recognize the presence of EPEC in fecal specimens is the inevitable consequence.",

            "text": "EPEC gastroenteritis is a worldwide problem, and socioeconomic conditions play a significant role in determining the incidence of this disease in different populations [245]. It is unusual for newborn infants born in a rural environment to manifest diarrheal disease caused by EPEC; most infections of the GI tract in these infants occur after the first 6 months of life [9,246]. Conversely, among infants born in large cities, the attack rate of EPEC is high during the first 3 months of life. This age distribution reflects in large part the frequency with which EPEC causes cross-infection outbreaks among nursery populations [207,[247], [248], [249], [250], [251], [252], [253], [254]]; however, a predominance of EPEC in infants in the first 3 months of life has also been described in community epidemics [[255], [256], [257]] and among sporadic cases of diarrhea acquired outside the hospital [[258], [259], [260], [261], [262], [263], [264]]. The disparity in the incidence of neonatal EPEC infection between rural and urban populations has been ascribed to two factors: the trend away from breast-feeding among mothers in industrialized societies and the crowding together of susceptible newborns in nurseries in countries in which hospital deliveries predominate over home deliveries [9,246,265]. Although the predominant serogroup can vary from year to year,*\nthe same strains have been prevalent during the past 40 years in Great Britain [268], Puerto Rico [269], Guatemala [9], Panama [223], Israel [264], Newfoundland [257], Indonesia [261], Thailand [270], Uganda [271], and South Africa [272].",

These results must be considered conservative and are probably an artifact of the sampling technique. One study using 150 O antisera to identify as many E. coli as possible in fecal cultures showed a correlation between the coliform flora in 66% of mother-infant pairs [279]. Of particular interest was the observation that the O groups of E. coli isolated from the infants' mucus immediately after delivery correlated with those subsequently recovered from their stools, supporting the contention that these organisms were acquired orally at the time of birth. In mothers whose stools contained the same O group as their offspring, the mean time from rupture of membranes to delivery was about 2 hours longer than in mothers whose infants did not acquire the same serogroups, suggesting that ascending colonization before birth also can play a role in determining the newborn's fecal flora.",

Stool culture surveys taken during outbreaks have shown that 20% to 50% of term neonates residing in the nursery carry EPEC in their intestinal tracts [118,247,248,251]. Despite descriptions of nursery outbreaks in which virtually every neonate or low birth weight infant became infected [278,280,297], there is ample evidence that exposure to pathogenic strains of E. coli does not result in greater likelihood of illness for premature infants than for term infants [277,288,295,298]. Any increased prevalence of cross-infections that may exist among premature infants can be explained more readily by their prolonged hospital stays, increased handling, and clustering of infants born in different institutions than by a particular susceptibility to EPEC based on immature defense mechanisms.",

The direction of spread is most often from the reservoir of disease within the community to the hospital. When the original source of a nursery outbreak can be established, frequently it is an infant born of a carrier mother who recently acquired EPEC infection from a toddler living in the home. Cross-infection epidemics also can be initiated by infected newborns that have been admitted directly into a clean nursery unit from the surrounding district [286,288,301] or have been transferred from a nearby hospital [294,296,302].",

Some epidemics are explosive, with rapid involvement of all susceptible infants and a duration that seldom exceeds 2 or 3 months [280,281,292,303]. The case-fatality rate in these epidemics may be very high. Other nursery outbreaks have an insidious onset with a few mild, unrecognized cases; the patients may not even develop illness until after discharge from the hospital. During the next few days to weeks, neonates with an increased number of loose stools are reported by the nurses; shortly thereafter, the appearance of the first severely ill infants makes it apparent that an epidemic has begun. Unless oral antimicrobial therapy is instituted (see \u201cTherapy\u201d), nursery outbreaks such as these may continue for months [[282], [283], [284], [285]] or years [286], with cycles of illness followed by periods of relative quiescence.

The release of infants who are in the incubation stages of illness or are convalescent carriers about to relapse may lead to secondary cases of diarrheal disease among young siblings living in widely scattered areas [255,256,260]. These children further disseminate infection to neighboring households, involving playmates of their own age, young infants, and mothers [255,256,259]. As the sickest of these contact cases are admitted to different hospitals, they contaminate new susceptible persons, completing the cycle and compounding the outbreak. This feedback mechanism has proved to be a means of spreading infantile gastroenteritis through entire cities [255,256,259], counties [256,301,306], and provinces [257]. One major epidemic of diarrhea related to EPEC O111:B4 that occurred in the metropolitan Chicago and northwestern Indiana region during the winter of 1961 involved more than 1300 children and 29 community hospitals during a period of 9 months [257,307]. Almost all of the patients were younger than 2 years, and 10% were younger than 1 month, producing an age-specific attack rate of nearly 4% of neonates in the community. The importance of the hospital as a source of cross-infection in this epidemic was shown through interviews with patients' families, indicating that a minimum of 40% of infants had direct or indirect contact with a hospital shortly before the onset of illness.",

The throat and nasal mucosa may represent a portal of entry or a source of transmission for EPEC. Environmental studies have shown that EPEC is distributed readily and widely in the vicinity of an infant with active diarrheal disease, often within 1 day of admission to the ward [249,312]. Massive numbers of organisms are shed in the diarrheal stool or vomitus of infected infants [266,312]. E. coli organisms may survive 2 to 4 weeks in dust [260,312] and can be found in the nursery air when the bedding or diapers of infected infants are disturbed during routine nursing procedures [260,312] or on floors; walls; cupboards; and nursery equipment such as scales, hand towels, bassinets, incubators, and oxygen tents of other infants [102,260,283]. Documentation of the presence of EPEC in nursery air and dust does not by itself establish the importance of this route as a source of cross-infection. One study presented evidence of the respiratory transmission of EPEC; however, even in the cases described, the investigators pointed out that fecal-oral transmission could not be completely ruled out [255]. Additional clinical and experimental data are required to clarify the significance of droplet and environmental infection.",

Although E. coli may disappear completely from stools of breast-fed infants during the ensuing weeks, this disappearance is believed to be related to factors present in the human milk rather than the gastric secretions [9,318,319]. The use of breast-feeding or expressed human milk has even been effective in terminating nursery epidemics caused by EPEC O111:B4, probably by reducing the incidence of cross-infections among infants [319,320]. Although dose-effect studies have not been performed among newborns, severe diarrhea has occurred after ingestion of 108 EPEC organisms by very young infants [321,322]. The high incidence of cross-infection outbreaks in newborn nurseries suggests that a far lower inoculum can often affect spread in this setting.",

Experiments with suckling mice have failed to show any effect of humoral immunity on the establishment or course of duration of intestinal colonization with E. coli O127 in mothers or their infants [328]. Similar observations have been made in epidemiologic studies among premature human infants using enteropathogenic (O127:B8) [325] and nonenteropathogenic (O4:H5) [285] strains of E. coli as the indicator organisms. In a cohort of 63 mothers and their infants followed from birth to 3 months old, Cooper and associates [99] showed a far higher incidence of clinical EPEC disease in infants of EPEC-negative mothers than in infants born of mothers with EPEC isolated from stool cultures. This finding suggests the possibility that mothers harboring EPEC in their GI tracts transfer specific antibodies to their infants that confer some protection during the first weeks of life.",

Although it is known that colonization of newborns with E. coli leads to the production of coproantibodies against the ingested organisms [329,330], the clinical significance of this intestinal immunity is uncertain. The previously mentioned experiment with mice showed no effect of active intestinal immunity on enteric colonization [328]. In human infants, the frequency of bacteriologic and clinical relapse related to EPEC of the same serotype [280,281,295] and the capacity of one strain of EPEC to superinfect a patient already harboring a different strain [264,274,284] also cast some doubt on the ability of mucosal antibodies to inhibit or alter the course of intestinal infection. Studies of the protective effects of orally administered EPEC vaccines could help to resolve these questions [265].",

The LEE secretion apparatus injects proteins directly from the cytoplasm of the infecting bacterium into the cytoplasm of the target enterocytes [342]. The injected proteins constitute cytoskeletal toxins, which together elicit the close apposition of the bacterium to the cell, cause the effacement of microvilli, and most likely give rise to the net secretory state [112,115,137]. One critical secreted protein, called translocated intimin receptor (Tir) [136], inserts into the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell, where it serves as the receptor for a LEE-encoded EPEC outer membrane protein called intimin [137]. Animals infected with attaching-and-effacing pathogens mount antibody responses to intimin and Tir [344], and both are considered potential vaccine immunogens. The lack of protection from EPEC reinfection suggests that natural antibody responses to Tir and intimin are not protective.",

BFP, a member of the type IV pilus family, mediates aggregation of the bacteria to each other and probably to enterocytes themselves, facilitating mucosal colonization [347]. A BFP mutant was shown to be attenuated in adult volunteers [348]. More recent epidemiologic data suggest that some virulent EPEC may lack the BFP; such strains are termed atypical EPEC [349,350]. These strains are not of the characteristic EPEC serotypes, and means to distinguish them clinically and microbiologically are unavailable as of this writing.",

Rothbaum and colleagues [338] described similar findings with dissolution of the glycocalyx and flattened microvilli with the nontoxigenic EPEC strain O119:B14. A wide range of pathologic findings has been reported in infants dying with EPEC gastroenteritis. Most newborns dying with diarrheal disease caused by EPEC show no morphologic changes of the GI tract by gross or microscopic examination of tissues [227,351]. Bray [228] described such \u201cmeager\u201d changes in the intestinal tract that \u201cthe impression received was that the term gastroenteritis is incorrect.\u201d At the other extreme, extensive and severe involvement of the intestinal tract, although distinctly unusual among neonates with EPEC diarrhea, has been discussed in several reviews of the pathologic anatomy of this disease [264,334,352]. Changes virtually identical to the changes found in infants dying with necrotizing enterocolitis have been reported [352]. Drucker and coworkers [334] found that among 17 infants with EPEC diarrhea who were dying, \u201cintestinal gangrene, and/or perforation, and/or peritonitis were present in five, and intestinal pneumatosis in five.\u201d",

The severity of intestinal lesions at the time of death does not correlate with the birth weight of the patient, the age of onset of illness, the serogroup of the infecting strain, or the prior administration of oral or systemic antimicrobial agents. The suggestion that the intensity of inflammatory changes may depend on the duration of the diarrhea [334] cannot be corroborated in autopsy studies [232,280,353] or small intestinal biopsy specimens [354,355]. It is difficult to reconcile such a thesis with the observation that a wide range of intestinal findings can be seen at autopsy among newborns infected by a single serotype of EPEC during an epidemic. The nonspecific pathologic picture described by some researchers includes capillary congestion and edema of the bowel wall and an increase in the number of eosinophils, plasma cells, macrophages, and mononuclear cells in the mucosa and submucosa [278,334,353]. Villous patterns are generally well preserved, although some flattening and broadening of the villi are seen in more severe cases. Almost complete absence of villi and failure of regeneration of small bowel mucosa have been reported in an extreme case [356]. Edema in and around the myenteric plexuses of Auerbach, a common associated finding, may cause the GI tract dilation often seen at autopsy in infants with EPEC infections [264,353,357]. Generally, the distal small intestine shows the most marked alterations; however, the reported pathologic findings may be found at all levels of the intestinal tract.",

Various degrees of tubular degeneration and cloudy swelling of convoluted tubules are common findings [232,301,353]. Renal vein thrombosis or cortical necrosis may be observed in infants with disseminated intravascular coagulation in the terminal phases of the illness. The heart is grossly normal in most instances, but may show minimal vacuolar changes of nonspecific toxic myocarditis on microscopic examination [353,357]. Candidal abscesses of the heart [357] and kidneys [301,353,357] have been described. With the exception of mild congestion of the pia arachnoid vessels and some edema of the meninges, examination of the central nervous system reveals few changes [232,278].",

When infants are exposed to EPEC, many become colonized as temporary stool [99,102,248] or pharyngeal [255] carriers with no signs of clinical disease. Although Laurell [358] showed that the percentage of asymptomatic infections increases steadily as age increases, this observation has not been confirmed by other investigators [231,359]. Similarly, the suggestion that prematurity per se is associated with a low incidence of inapparent EPEC infection has been documented in several clinical studies [278,280,281], but refuted in others [269,295].",

Its duration has been calculated mostly from evidence in outbreaks in newborn nurseries, where the time of first exposure can be clearly defined in terms of birth or admission dates. In these circumstances, almost all infants show signs of illness 2 to 12 days after exposure, and most cases show signs within the first 7 days [232,248,280]. In some naturally acquired [99,100] and experimental [322] infections with heavy exposure, the incubation period may be only 24 hours; the stated upper limit is 20 days [249,360]. The first positive stool culture and the earliest recognizable clinical signs of disease occur simultaneously in most infants [280,282], although colonization may precede symptoms by 7 to 14 days [281,282,361].",

Clinical manifestations vary from mild illness manifest only by transient anorexia and failure to gain weight to a sudden explosive fulminating diarrhea causing death within 12 hours of onset. Prematurity, underlying disease, and congenital anomalies often are associated with the more severe forms of illness [231,250,362,363]. Experienced clinicians have observed that the severity of EPEC gastroenteritis has declined markedly during the past 3 decades [242]. The onset of illness usually is insidious, with vague signs of reluctance to feed, lethargy, spitting up of formula, mild abdominal distention, or weight loss that may occur for 1 or 2 days before the first loose stool is passed. Diarrhea usually begins abruptly. It may be continuous and violent, or in milder infections, it may run an intermittent course with 1 or more days of normal stools followed by 1 or more days of diarrhea. Emesis sometimes is a prominent and persistent early finding. Stools are loose and bright yellow initially, later becoming watery, mucoid, and green. Flecks or streaks of blood, which are commonly seen with enterocolitis caused by Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Shigella, are rarely a feature of EPEC diarrheal disease.",

Fever is an inconstant feature, and when it occurs, the patient's temperature rarely is greater than 39\u00b0 C (>102.2\u00b0 F). Convulsions occur infrequently; their occurrence should alert the clinician to the possible presence of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypernatremia.

Occasionally, the signs of illness during a relapse can be more severe than those accompanying the initial attack of illness [232,249,301]. Not all clinical relapses result from persistent infection. Many relapses, particularly relapses that consistently follow attempts at reinstitution of formula feedings [278,281], are caused by disaccharide intolerance, rather than bacterial proliferation. Intestinal superinfections, caused by another serotype of EPEC [299,364,365] or by completely different enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella or Shigella [262], also can delay the resolution of symptoms. Rarely, infants have a \u201crelapse\u201d caused by an organism from the same O group as the original strain but differing in its H antigen. Unless complete serotyping is performed on all EPEC isolates, such an event easily could be dismissed as being a recurrence rather than a superinfection with a new organism [274,284].",

Dehydration is the most common and serious complication of gastroenteritis caused by EPEC or a toxin-producing E. coli. Virtually all deaths directly attributable to the intestinal infection are caused by disturbances in fluids and electrolytes. When stools are frequent in number, large in volume, and violent in release, as they often are in severe infections with abrupt onset, a neonate can lose 15% of body weight in a few hours [249,292]. Rarely, fluid excretion into the lumen of the bowel proceeds so rapidly that reduction of circulating blood volume and shock may intervene before passage of a single loose stool [278].

Necrotizing enterocolitis, which occasionally results in perforation of the bowel and peritonitis, has not been causally related to infection with EPEC [264,280,282]. A review of most of the large clinical series describing EPEC disease in infants ranging in age from newborn to 2 years revealed only three proven instances of bacteremia [281,294], one possible urinary tract infection [281], and one documented case of meningitis in an infant of unspecified age [367]. Focal infections among neonates were limited to several cases of otitis media [264,278] and a subcutaneous abscess [310] from which EPEC was isolated. Additional complications include interstitial pneumonia [334], GI bleeding with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation [352,368], and methemoglobinemia caused by a mutant of EPEC O127:B8 that was capable of generating large quantities of nitrite from proteins present in the GI tract [369].",

Classic EPEC has been recovered from the vomitus, stool, or bowel contents of infected newborns. Isolation from bile [250] and the upper respiratory tract [99,255,256] has been described in instances in which a specific search has been made.

Specimens should be obtained as early in the course of the illness as possible because organisms are present in virtually pure culture during the acute phase of the enteritis, but diminish in numbers during convalescence. Because of the preponderance of EPEC in diarrheal stools, two cultures are adequate for isolation of these pathogens in almost all cases of active disease. Studies using fluorescent antibody methods for identification of EPEC in stool specimens have shown that during the incubation period of the illness, during convalescence, and among asymptomatic carriers of EPEC, organisms can be excreted in such small numbers that they escape detection by standard bacteriologic methods in a significant proportion of infants [262,371,372]. Three to 10 specimens may be required to detect EPEC using methods that identify individual EPEC isolates in the stool [99,363].",

E. coli, similar to other Enterobacteriaceae members, possesses cell wall somatic antigens (O), envelope or capsular antigens (K), and, if motile, flagellar antigens (H). Many O groups may be divided further into two or more subgroups (a, b, c), and the K antigens are divisible into at least three varieties (B, L, A) on the basis of their physical behavior. Organisms that do not possess flagellar antigens are nonmotile (designated NM). The EPEC B capsular surface antigen prevents agglutination by antibodies directed against the underlying O antigen. Heating at 100\u00b0 C for 1 hour inactivates the agglutinability and antigenicity of the B antigen.",

Salmonella and Shigella that had not been identified on cultures obtained at admission were isolated only after institution of oral therapy with neomycin. Nelson also [262] postulated that the alteration in bowel flora brought about by the neomycin facilitated the growth of these organisms, which had previously been suppressed and obscured by coliform overgrowth.

The rapidity with which determinations can be performed makes them ideally suited for screening ill infants and possible carriers in determining the extent and progression of a nursery [288,298] or community [255,307] outbreak. Because immunofluorescence does not depend on the viability of organisms and is not affected by antibiotics that suppress growth on culture plates, it can be used to advantage in following bacteriologic responses and relapses in patients receiving oral therapy [351,380]. The use of fluorescent antibody techniques offers many advantages in the surveillance and epidemiologic control of EPEC gastroenteritis.

The use of atropine-like drugs, paregoric, or loperamide to reduce intestinal motility or cramping should be avoided.

Nonetheless, several clinical investigations have provided sufficient information to guide the physician faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to treat an individual infant or an entire nursery population with EPEC diarrheal disease.

            "text": "The effectiveness of oral antimicrobial therapy in reducing the duration of EPEC excretion serves to diminish environmental contamination and the spread of pathogenic organisms from one infant to another. Breaking the chain of fecal-oral transmission by administering antimicrobial agents simultaneously to all carriers of EPEC and their immediate contacts in the nursery has seemed to be valuable in terminating outbreaks that have failed to respond to more conservative measures [251,280,389]. The apparent reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with oral administration of neomycin [247,250,251], colistin [263,283,301], polymyxin [259], or gentamicin [263] during nursery epidemics has led to the impression that these drugs also exert a beneficial clinical effect in severely or moderately ill infants. Reports describing clinical [272], bacteriologic [281], or histopathologic [334] evidence of tissue invasion by EPEC have persuaded some investigators to suggest the use of parenteral rather than oral drug therapy in debilitated or malnourished infants. On the basis of these data, there seems to be sufficient evidence to recommend oral administration of nonabsorbable antibiotics in the treatment of severely or moderately ill newborns with EPEC gastroenteritis. The drug most frequently used for initial therapy is neomycin sulfate in a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day administered orally every 8 hours in three divided doses [262]. In communities in which neomycin-resistant EPEC has been prevalent, treatment with colistin sulfate or polymyxin B in a dosage of 15 to 20 mg/kg/day orally and divided into three equal doses may be appropriate. It is rarely necessary to use this approach, however.",

If fluorescent antibody testing of rectal swab specimens is available, therapy can be discontinued as soon as EPEC no longer is identified in smears; this takes no more than 48 hours in more than 90% of cases [262]. After diarrhea and vomiting have stopped, and the infant tolerates formula feedings, shows a steady weight gain, and appears clinically well, discharge with outpatient follow-up is indicated. Bacteriologic relapses do not require therapy, unless they are associated with illness or high epidemiologic risks to other young infants in the household. Because the infecting organisms in these recurrences generally continue to show in vitro susceptibility to the original drug, it should be reinstituted pending bacteriologic results [262].",

For these reasons, variations in susceptibility patterns are apparent in different nurseries [263,393] and even occasionally within the same institution [264,265,267]. Sudden changes in clinical response may occur during the course of a single epidemic as drug-susceptible strains of EPEC are replaced by strains with multidrug resistance [250,307,392]. Because differences can exist in the susceptibilities of different EPEC serogroups to various antimicrobial agents, regional susceptibility patterns should be reported on the basis of OB group or serotype rather than for EPEC as a whole [267].

Because of the difficulty in diagnosing EPEC infection, reference laboratories, such as those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should be notified when an outbreak is suspected.

Specific procedures have been suggested for handling a suspected outbreak of bacterial enteritis in a newborn nursery or infant care unit [252,371,373]. Evidence indicating that a significant proportion of E. coli enteritis may be caused by nontypable strains has required some modification of these earlier recommendations. The following infection control measures may be appropriate:1.The unit is closed, when possible, to all new admissions.2.Personnel and parents should pay scrupulous attention to hand hygiene when handling infants.3.Cultures for enteric pathogens are obtained from nursing personnel assigned to the unit at the time of the outbreak.4.Stool specimens obtained from all infants in the nursery can be screened by the fluorescent antibody or another technique and cultured. Identification of a classic enteropathogenic serotype provides a useful epidemiologic marker; however, failure to isolate one of these strains does not eliminate the possibility of illness caused by nontypable EPEC.5.Antimicrobial therapy with oral neomycin or colistin can be considered for all infants with a positive fluorescent antibody test or culture result. The initial drug of choice depends on local patterns of susceptibility. Depending on the results of susceptibility tests, subsequent therapy may require modification.6.If an identifiable EPEC strain is isolated, second and third stool specimens from all infants in the unit are reexamined by the fluorescent antibody technique or culture at 48-hour intervals. If this is impractical, exposed infants should be carefully followed.7.Early discharge for healthy, mature, uninfected infants is advocated.8.An epidemiologic investigation should be performed to seek the factor or factors responsible for the outbreak. A surveillance system may be established for all individuals in contact with the nursery, including physicians and other health care personnel, housekeeping personnel, and postpartum mothers with evidence of enteric disease. A telephone, mail, or home survey may be conducted on all infants who were residing in the involved unit during the 2 weeks before the outbreak.9.When all patients and contacts are discharged and control of the outbreak is achieved, a thorough terminal disinfection of the involved nursery is mandatory [397].\n",

A particularly virulent subset of STEC, EHEC, causes frequent and severe outbreaks of GI disease [112,399]; the most virulent EHEC organisms belong to serotype O157:H7. EHEC has a bovine reservoir and is transmitted by undercooked meat; unpasteurized milk; and contaminated vegetables such as lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and radish sprouts (as occurred in over 9000 schoolchildren in Japan) [400,401]. It also spreads directly from person to person [401,402]. The clinical syndrome comprises bloody, noninflammatory (sometimes voluminous) diarrhea that is distinct from febrile dysentery with fecal leukocytes seen in shigellosis or EIEC infections [112]. Most cases of EHEC infections have been recognized in outbreaks of bloody diarrhea or HUS in day care centers, schools, nursing homes, and communities [[402], [403], [404]]. Although EHEC infections often involve infants and young children, the frequency of this infection in neonates is unclear; animal studies suggest that receptors for the Shiga toxin may be developmentally regulated and that susceptibility to disease may be age related [405].",

Shiga toxin 1 is neutralized by antiserum against the Shiga toxin of S. dysenteriae, whereas Shiga toxin 2, although biologically similar, is not neutralized by anti\u2013Shiga toxin [409,410]. Similar to Shiga toxin made by S. dysenteriae, both E. coli Shiga toxins act by inhibiting protein synthesis by cleaving an adenosine residue from position 4324 in the 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to prevent elongation factor-1\u2013dependent aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) from binding to the 60S rRNA [406,407]. The virulence of EHEC may also be determined in part by a 60-MDa plasmid that encodes for a fimbrial adhesin in O157 and O26 [411,412]. This phenotype is mediated by the LEE pathogenicity island, which is highly homologous to the island present in EPEC strains [343].",

Because most cases are caused by ingestion of contaminated food, neonates have a degree of epidemiologic protection from the illness. STEC diarrhea is diagnosed by isolation and identification of the pathogen in the feces. E. coli O157:H7 does not ferment sorbitol, and this biochemical trait is commonly used in the detection of this serotype [112,413]. Because some nonpathogenic E. coli share this characteristic, confirmation of the serotype by slide agglutination is required. These techniques can be performed in most clinical laboratories. Detection of non-O157 serotypes is problematic, however, and relies on detection of the Shiga toxin; available methods include Shiga toxin ELISA, latex agglutination, and molecular methods [112,413].",

Several studies from the Indian subcontinent implicated EAEC among the most frequent enteric pathogens [428,429,432]. Other sites reproducibly reporting high incidence rates include Mexico [430] and Brazil [431,433]. There is evidence that EAEC may be increasing in incidence. A study from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, implicated EAEC as the prevalent E. coli pathotypes in infants [433], replacing EPEC in this community.

S. typhi, S. choleraesuis, Salmonella heidelberg [454,455], and Salmonella dublin [456] are particularly invasive, with bacteremia and extraintestinal focal infections occurring frequently. Salmonella species encode injected toxins closely related to the invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa) of Shigella species. These proteins mediate invasion of target epithelial cells in Salmonella and Shigella strains [457]. A common Salmonella virulence plasmid confers resistance to complement-mediated bacteriolysis by inhibition of insertion of the terminal C5b-9 membrane attack complex into the outer membrane [458,459]. Laboratory studies have shown dramatic strain-related difference in the ability of Salmonella typhimurium to evoke fluid secretion, to invade intestinal mucosa, and to disseminate beyond the gut [460]. The production of an enterotoxin that is immunologically related to cholera toxin by about two thirds of Salmonella strains may play a role in the watery diarrhea commonly seen [461]. The significance of protein synthesis\u2013inhibiting cytotoxins [462] remains to be proved, although such toxins can damage gut epithelium, which could facilitate invasion. The cytotoxins produced by Salmonella are not immunologically related to Shiga toxin made by S. dysenteriae type 1 [463] or E. coli O157:H7.",

            "text": "Salmonellae have the ability to penetrate epithelial cells and reach the submucosa, where they are ingested by phagocytes [464]. In phagocytes, salmonellae are resistant to killing, in part because of the properties of their lipopolysaccharides [465,466] and multiple enzymes for oxidant defense [466a]. Persistence of the organism within phagolysosomes of phagocytic cells may occur with any species of Salmonella. It is unclear how the organisms have adapted to survive in the harsh intracellular environment, but their survival has major clinical significance, accounting for relapse after antibiotic therapy and the inadequacy of some antimicrobial agents that do not penetrate phagolysosomes. It is also perhaps the reason for prolonged febrile courses that occur even in the face of appropriate therapy. Although humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity are stimulated during Salmonella infections, it is believed that cell-mediated immunity plays a greater role in eradication of the bacteria [467]. T-cell activation of macrophages seems to be important in killing intracellular Salmonella [468]. Defective interferon-\u03b3 production by monocytes of newborns in response to S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide may explain in part the unusual susceptibility of infants to Salmonella infection [469]. Studies in mice suggest that T helper type 1 cell responses in Peyer patches and mesenteric lymph nodes may be central to protection of the intestinal mucosa [470]. Humans who lack the interleukin-12 receptor and have impaired T helper type 1 cell responses and interferon-\u03b3 production are at increased risk for Salmonella infection [471].",

S. typhi alone expressed the Vi antigen, a surface capsule that inhibits phagocytosis. Patients who develop classic enteric fever have positive stool cultures in the first few days after ingestion of the organism and again late in the course after a period of bacteremia. This course reflects early colonization of the gut, penetration of gut epithelium with infection of mesenteric lymph nodes, and reseeding of the gut during a subsequent bacteremic phase [472]. Studies of S. typhimurium in monkeys suggest similar initial steps in pathogenesis (e.g., colonization of gut, penetration of gut epithelium, infection of mesenteric lymph nodes), but failure of the organism to cause a detectable level of bacteremia [473].",

Acute crypt abscesses can be seen in the stomach and small intestine, but the most dramatic changes occur in the colon, where acute diffuse inflammation with mucosal edema and crypt abscesses are the most consistent findings [474,475].

Half of commercial poultry samples are contaminated with Salmonella [476]. Definition of the serotype causing infection can sometimes suggest the likely source. S. dublin is closely associated with cattle; human cases occur with a higher-than-predicted frequency in people who drink raw milk [456]. For S. typhimurium, which is the most common serotype and accounts for more than one third of all reported human cases, a single source has not been established, although there is an association with cattle. Despite the 1975 ban by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on interstate commercial distribution of small turtles, these animals continue to be associated with infection, as illustrated by a series of cases in Puerto Rico [477]. Various pet reptiles are an important source of various unusual Salmonella serotypes such as Salmonella marina, Salmonella chameleon, Salmonella arizonae, Salmonella java, Salmonella stanley, Salmonella poona, Salmonella jangwain, Salmonella tilene, and several others [[478], [479], [480]]. Salmonella organisms are hardy and capable of prolonged survival; organisms have been documented to survive in flour for nearly a year [481].

A neonate with Salmonella infection infrequently acquires the organism from his or her mother during delivery. Although the index case in an outbreak can often be traced to a mother [[488], [489], [490], [491],509], subsequent cases result from contaminated objects in the nursery environment [512,513] serving as a reservoir coming in contact with hands of attending personnel [482,497]. The mother of an index case may be symptomatic [493,494,514,515] or asymptomatic with preclinical infection [498], convalescent infection [491,495,516], or chronic carriage [517]. The risk of a newborn becoming infected when Salmonella is introduced into a nursery has been reported to be 20% to 27% [501,507], but the frequency of infection may be lower because isolated cases outside the context of a subsequent epidemic are unlikely to be reported.",

Premature and low birth weight infants seem to be at higher risk of acquiring Salmonella infection than term neonates [497,499].

Most infected infants who become ill have abrupt onset of loose, green, mucus-containing stools, or they have bloody diarrhea; an elevated temperature is also a common finding in Salmonella gastroenteritis in the first months of life [455]. Grossly bloody stools are found in a few patients, although grossly bloody stools can occur in the first 24 hours of life.

In a series of S. newport infections involving 11 premature infants [488], 90% of infants with gastroenteritis had blood in their stools, 10% had fever, 10% had mucus in their stools, and 9% were asymptomatic. In an outbreak of S. typhimurium [491] involving 11 ill and 5 healthy infants, none had bloody stools; all of the symptomatic infants were febrile and usually had loose green stools. Of 26 infants infected by Salmonella virchow, 42% were asymptomatic; the rest had mild diarrhea [496]. Seals and colleagues [502] described 12 infants with S. nienstedten, all of whom had watery diarrhea and low-grade fever; none had bloody stools. In a large outbreak in Zimbabwe of S. heidelberg infection reported by Bannerman [499], 38% of 100 infants were asymptomatic, 42% had diarrhea, 16% had fever, 15% had pneumonia, and 2% developed meningitis. An outbreak of Salmonella worthington was characterized primarily by diarrhea, fever, and jaundice, although 3 of 18 infants developed meningitis, and 17% died [529]. In dramatic contrast to these series, none of 27 infants with positive stool cultures for S. tennessee had an illness in a nursery found to be contaminated with that organism [483]. A few infants with Salmonella gastroenteritis have developed necrotizing enterocolitis [506,539], but it is unclear whether Salmonella was the cause.",

A study of more than 800 children with Salmonella infection showed that extraintestinal infection occurred significantly more often (8.7% versus 3.6%) in the first 3 months of life [545]. Several retrospective studies suggest that infants in the first month of life may have a risk of bacteremia of 30% to 50% [455]. One retrospective study [454] suggested that the risk is not increased in infancy and estimated that the risk of bacteremia in childhood Salmonella gastroenteritis is 8.5% to 15.6%. Prospective studies of infants in the first year of life suggest that the risk of bacteremia is 1.8% to 6% [546,547].

Of all cases of nontyphoidal Salmonella meningitis, 50% to 75% occur in the first 4 months of life [551]. The serotypes associated with neonatal meningitis (S. typhimurium, S. heidelberg, S. enteritidis, S. saint-paul, S. newport, and Salmonella panama) [511] are serotypes frequently associated with bacteremia. Meningitis has a high mortality rate, in part because of high relapse rates. Relapse has been reported in 64% of cases [552]. In some studies, more than 90% of patients with meningitis have died [553], although more typically, 30% to 60% of infants die [554,555]. The survivors experience the expected complications of gram-negative neonatal meningitis, including hydrocephalus, seizures, ventriculitis, abscess formation, subdural empyema, and permanent neurologic impairment.

Infected infants develop typical findings of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Current data suggest that mortality is about 30% [564]. In utero infection with S. typhi has been described. Typhoid fever [532,565] and nontyphoidal Salmonella infections [566] during pregnancy put women at risk of aborting the fetus. Premature labor usually occurs during the 2nd to 4th week of maternal typhoid if the woman is untreated [536]. In a survey of typhoid fever in pregnancy during the preantibiotic era, 24 of 60 women with well-documented cases delivered prematurely, with resultant fetal death; the rest delivered at term, although only 17 infants survived [567]. The outlook for carrying the pregnancy to term and delivering a healthy infant seems to have improved dramatically during the antibiotic era. One of seven women with typhoid in a series still delivered a dead fetus with extensive liver necrosis, however [568]. In the preantibiotic era, about 14% of pregnant women with typhoid fever died [569]. With appropriate antimicrobial therapy, pregnancy does not seem to put the woman at increased risk of death. Despite these well-described cases, typhoid fever is rare early in life.",

Diagnosis of neonatal salmonellosis should trigger an investigation for other cases. Other than diarrhea, signs of neonatal Salmonella infection are similar to the nonspecific findings seen in most neonatal infections. Lethargy, poor feeding, pallor, jaundice, apnea, respiratory distress, weight loss, and fever are common. Enlarged liver and spleen are common in neonates with positive blood cultures. Laboratory studies are required to establish the diagnosis because the clinical picture is not distinct. The fecal leukocyte examination reveals polymorphonuclear leukocytes in 36% to 82% [376,573] of persons with Salmonella infection, but it has not been evaluated in neonates. The presence of fecal leukocytes is consistent with colitis of any cause and is a nonspecific finding. Routine stool cultures usually detect Salmonella if two or three different enteric media (i.e., MacConkey, eosin\u2013methylene blue, Salmonella-Shigella, Tergitol 7, xylose-lysine-deoxycholate, brilliant green, or bismuth sulfite agar) are used. Stool, rather than rectal swab material, is preferable for culture, particularly if the aim of culture is to detect carriers [574]. On the infrequent occasions when proctoscopy is performed, mucosal edema, hyperemia, friability, and hemorrhages may be seen [475].",

Studies that have included a few neonates suggest little benefit from antimicrobial therapy [491,501,581,590,591]. Because bacteremia is common in neonates, antimicrobial therapy for infants younger than 3 months who have Salmonella gastroenteritis often is recommended [546,547,575], however, especially if the infant appears toxic. Premature infants and infants who have other significant debilitating conditions also should probably be treated. The duration of therapy is debatable, but should probably be no more than 3 to 5 days if the infant is not seriously ill and if blood cultures are sterile. If toxicity, clinical deterioration, or documented bacteremia complicates gastroenteritis, prolonged treatment is indicated. Even with antimicrobial therapy, some infants develop complications. The relatively low risk of extraintestinal dissemination must be balanced against the well-documented risk of prolonging the carrier state. For infants who develop chronic diarrhea and malnutrition, hyperalimentation may be required; the role of antimicrobial agents in this setting is unclear. An infant with typhoid fever should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent; relapses sometimes occur after therapy.",

The relative instabilities of some antibiotics in this acid environment also may explain in vitro and in vivo disparities. The intracellular localization and survival of Salmonella within phagocytic cells also presumably explains the relapses encountered with virtually every regimen. Resistance to antibiotics has long been a problem with Salmonella infection [579,592,593] and has been steadily increasing in the United States [594]. With the emergence of Typhimurium type DT 104, resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline has increased from 0.6% in 1979 and 1980 to 34% in 1996 [595].",

Resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin has made trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increasingly important for the treatment of Salmonella infection in patients who require therapy. With increasing resistance to all three of these agents in Asia [596], the Middle East [597], Africa [598], Europe [599,600], Argentina [593], and North America [592,601,602], the third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones represent drugs of choice for invasive salmonellosis. The quinolones currently are not approved for patients younger than 18 years. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone represent acceptable alternative drugs for typhoidal and nontyphoidal salmonellosis when resistance is encountered [603,604]. Because second-generation cephalosporins, such as cefuroxime, are less active in vitro than third-generation cephalosporins and are not consistently clinically effective, they should not be used [603,605]. Data suggest that cefoperazone may sterilize blood and cause patients with typhoid fever to become afebrile more rapidly than with chloramphenicol [606], perhaps because cefoperazone is excreted into bile in high concentrations [607]. Third-generation cephalosporins may have higher cure and lower relapse rates than ampicillin or chloramphenicol in children with Salmonella meningitis [608].",

When a neonate develops salmonellosis, a search for other infants who have been in the same nursery should be undertaken. When two or more cases are recognized, environmental cultures, cultures of all infants, cohorting and contact isolation of infected infants, rigorous enforcement of hand hygiene, early discharge of infected infants, and thorough cleaning of all possible fomites in the nursery and delivery rooms are important elements of control. If cases continue to occur, the nursery should be closed to further admissions. Cultures of nursery personnel are likely to be helpful in the unusual situation of an S. typhi outbreak in which a chronic carrier may be among the caretakers. Whether culture of health care personnel during outbreaks of salmonellosis caused by other Salmonella species is helpful is debatable, although it is often recommended. Data suggest that nurses infected with Salmonella rarely infect patients in the hospital setting [610]. The fact that nursing personnel are sometimes found to be colonized during nursery outbreaks [482,488,501,503,504] may be a result rather than a cause of the epidemics.",

The major determinants of virulence are encoded by a 120- to 140-MDa plasmid [618,619]. This plasmid, which is found in all virulent shigellae, encodes the synthesis of proteins that are required for invasion of mammalian cells and for the vigorous inflammatory response that is characteristic of the disease [620,621]. Shigellae that have lost this plasmid, have deletions of genetic material from the region involved in synthesis of these proteins, or have the plasmid inserted into the chromosome lose the ability to invade eukaryotic cells and become avirulent [622]; maintenance of the plasmid can be detected in the clinical microbiology laboratory by ability to bind Congo red. The ability to invade cells is the basic pathogenic property shared by all shigellae [623,624] and by Shigella-like invasive E. coli, which also possesses the Shigella virulence plasmid [223,620,621,625,626]. In the laboratory, Shigella invasiveness is studied in tissue culture (HeLa cell invasion), in animal intestine, or in rabbit or guinea pig eye, where instillation of the organism causes keratoconjunctivitis (Sereny test) [143]. Animal model studies have shown that bacteria penetrate and kill colonic mucosal cells and then elicit a brisk inflammatory response.",

Shigella follows an unusual pathogenetic course. The bacteria invade the epithelial cell via pathogen-directed endocytosis. The bacteria then force lysis of the endocytic vacuole, gaining entry into the host cell cytoplasm. Here, the bacteria nucleate actin proteins into a structure with the appearance of a comet's tail behind the bacterium and use the force of this event to propel them into adjacent cells. This sequence promotes lateral spread through the mucosa. Some organisms pass through the epithelial barrier and are engulfed by macrophages, with subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines. The release of these cytokines, coupled with the destruction of invaded epithelial cells, gives rise to the inflammatory, destructive nature of shigellosis.",

The specific gene products of some of the chromosomal loci are unknown; one chromosomal virulence segment encodes for synthesis of the O repeat units of lipopolysaccharide. Intact lipopolysaccharide is necessary but not sufficient to cause virulence [627,630]. At least two cell-damaging cytotoxins that also are chromosomally encoded are produced by shigellae. One of these toxins (Shiga toxin) is made in large quantities by S. dysenteriae serotype 1 (the Shiga bacillus) and is made infrequently by other shigellae [631]. Shiga toxin is a major virulence factor in S. dysenteriae, enhancing virulence at the colonic mucosa and giving rise to sequelae similar to those caused by STEC (discussed earlier). This toxin kills cells by interfering with peptide elongation during protein synthesis [[632], [633], [634]]. Additional toxins may also be secreted by shigellae, although their roles in virulence are not established [635].",

Shigellae, similar to other organisms transmitted by the fecal-oral route, are commonly spread by food and water, but the low infecting inoculum allows person-to-person spread. Because of this low inoculum, Shigella is one of the few enteric pathogens that can infect swimmers [636]. The dose required to cause illness in adult volunteers is 10 organisms for S. dysenteriae serotype 1 [637], about 200 organisms for S. flexneri [638], and 500 organisms for S. sonnei [639]. Person-to-person transmission of infection probably explains the continuing occurrence of Shigella in the developed world. Enteropathogens that require large inocula and are best spread by food or drinking water are less common in industrialized societies because of sewage disposal facilities, water treatment, and food-handling practices. In the United States, day care centers currently serve as a major focus for acquisition of shigellosis [640]. Numerous outbreaks of shigellosis related to crowding, poor sanitation, and the low dose required for diseases have occurred in this setting.",

It is, however, paradoxical that symptomatic infection is uncommon in the first year of life [[641], [642], [643], [644]]. The best data on the age-related incidence of shigellosis come from Mata's [641] prospective studies of Guatemalan infants. In these studies, stool cultures were performed weekly on a group of children followed from birth to 3 years old. The rate of infection was more than 60-fold lower in the first 6 months of life than between 2 and 3 years (Fig. 11\u20131\n) [641]. The same age-related incidence has been described in the United States [644] and in a rural Egyptian village [643]. This anomaly has been explained by the salutary effects of breast-feeding [[645], [646], [647]]. It is likely, however, that breast-feeding alone does not explain the resistance of infants to shigellosis.",

In an older child, the initial signs are usually high fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, toxicity, and large-volume watery stools; diarrhea may be bloody or may become bloody. Painful defecation and severe, crampy abdominal pain associated with frequent passage of small-volume stools with gross blood and mucus are characteristic findings in older children or adults who develop severe colitis. Many children never develop bloody diarrhea, however.

In neonates and malnourished children, chronic diarrhea may follow a bout of shigellosis [652,660]. Of hospitalized children with Shigella, 10% to 35% have convulsions before or during the course of diarrhea [[661], [662], [663]]. Usually, the seizures are brief, generalized, and associated with high fever. Seizures are uncommon in the first 6 months of life, although neonates have been described with seizures [654,664]. The cerebrospinal fluid generally reveals normal values in these children, but a few have mild cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. The neurologic outcome generally is good even with focal or prolonged seizures, but fatalities occasionally occur, often associated with toxic encephalopathy [665]. Although the seizures had been postulated to result from the neurotoxicity of Shiga toxin, this explanation was proved to be incorrect because most shigellae make little or no Shiga toxin, and the strains isolated from children with neurologic symptoms do not produce Shiga toxin [631,666]. Hemolysis with or without development of uremia is a complication primarily of S. dysenteriae serotype 1 infection [667].",

            "text": "Sepsis during the course of shigellosis may be caused by the Shigella itself or by other gut flora that gain access to the bloodstream through damaged mucosa [647,668,669]. The risk of sepsis is higher in the 1st year of life, particularly in neonates [647,[652], [653], [654],664,670], in malnourished infants, and in infants with S. dysenteriae serotype 1 infection [669]. Sepsis may occur in 12% of neonates with shigellosis [646,661,668,671]. Given the infrequency of neonatal shigellosis, it is striking that 9% of reported cases of Shigella sepsis have involved infants in the 1st month of life [672]. One of the infants with bacteremia [673] reportedly had no discernible illness. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may develop in patients whose course is complicated by sepsis. Meningitis has been described in a septic neonate. Colonic perforation has occurred in neonates [645,674], older children [675], and adults [676]. Although this complication of toxic megacolon is rare, it seems to be more common in neonates than in older individuals. Bronchopneumonia may complicate the course of shigellosis, but shigellae are rarely isolated from lungs or tracheal secretions [677]. The syndrome of sudden death in the setting of extreme toxicity with hyperpyrexia and convulsions but without dehydration or sepsis (i.e., Ekiri syndrome) [[678], [679], [680]] is rare in neonates. In a nonbacteremic child, other extraintestinal foci of infection, including vagina [681,682] and eye [683], rarely occur. Reiter syndrome, which rarely complicates the illness in children, has not been reported in neonates.",

Infants presenting with bloody diarrhea may have necrotizing enterocolitis or infection with Salmonella, EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, C. jejuni, or Entamoeba histolytica. Before cultures establish a diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data may aid in making a presumptive diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs showing pneumatosis intestinalis suggest the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis.

Almost 30% of children with shigellosis have greater than 25% bands on the differential cell count [[689], [690], [691]]. Few reports address the white blood cell count in newborns, but those that do suggest that normal or low rather than elevated counts are more common. Although serum and fecal antibodies develop to lipopolysaccharides and virulence plasmid\u2013associated polypeptides [692], serologic studies are not useful in the diagnosis of shigellosis.

Although debate continues over the indications for antimicrobial therapy in patients with shigellosis, the benefits of therapy generally seem to outweigh the risks. The chief disadvantages of antimicrobial therapy include cost, drug toxicity, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant shigellae. Because of the self-limited nature of shigellosis, it has been argued that less severe illness should not be treated. Children can feel quite ill during the typical bout of shigellosis, however, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy shortens the duration of illness and eliminates shigellae from stool, decreasing secondary spread. Complications are probably decreased by antibiotics. Given the high mortality rates of neonatal shigellosis, therapy should not be withheld.",

Ceftriaxone is generally active against shigellae, but in the neonate, this drug can displace bilirubin-binding sites and elicit clinically significant cholestasis. Data on children and adults suggest that clinical improvement occurs with ceftriaxone [711,712]. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been shown to be effective agents for treating shigellosis [713,714] in adults, but they are not approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 18 years. In severe cases of shigellosis, a quinolone may be considered because the fear of quinolone-associated cartilage damage has decreased over time. Other drugs sometimes used to treat diarrhea pose special risks to the infant with shigellosis. The antimotility agents, in addition to their intoxication risk, may pose a special danger in dysentery. In adults, diphenoxylate hydrochloride with atropine has been shown to prolong fever and excretion of the organism [715]. Cefixime may be an effective oral agent in children [221].",

Specific antibodies in milk seem to prevent symptomatic shigellosis [81,83]; nonspecific modification of gut flora and the lack of bacterial contamination of human milk also may be important. Breast-feeding, even when other foods are consumed, decreases the risk of shigellosis; children who continue to consume human milk into the 3rd year of life are still partially protected from illness [716]. In the United States, the best means of preventing infection in the infant is good hand hygiene when an older sibling or parent develops diarrhea. Even in unsanitary environments, secondary spread of shigellae can be dramatically decreased by hand hygiene after defecation and before meals [717]. Spread of shigellae in the hospital nursery can presumably be prevented by the use of contact isolation for infants with diarrhea and attention to thorough hand hygiene. Although nursery personnel have acquired shigellosis from infected newborns [698], further transmission to other infants in the nursery, although described [718], is rare. In contrast to Salmonella, large outbreaks of nosocomial shigellosis in neonates are rare.",

This organism subsequently was identified as a major venereally transmitted cause of abortion and sterility and as a cause of scours in cattle, sheep, and goats [721,722]. It was not until 1947, when it was isolated from the blood culture of a pregnant woman who subsequently aborted at 6 months' gestation, that the significance of Campylobacter as a relatively rare cause of bacteremia and perinatal infections in humans was appreciated [[723], [724], [725]]. During the 1970s, Campylobacter was recognized to be an opportunistic pathogen in debilitated patients [726,727]. In 1963, V. fetus and related organisms were separated from the vibrios (e.g., V. cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and placed in a new genus, Campylobacter (Greek word for \u201ccurved rod\u201d) [729]. Since 1973, several Campylobacter species have been recognized as a common cause of enteritis [[730], [731], [732], [733], [734], [735], [736], [737], [738], [739], [740], [741], [742], [743], [744], [745], [746]] and, in some cases, extraintestinal infections.",

Previously called related vibrios by King [763], this organism had been associated with bloody diarrhea and colitis in infants and adults only when it had been associated with a recognized bacteremia [[769], [770], [771]]. In the late 1970s, development of selective fecal culture methods for C. jejuni enabled its recognition worldwide as one of the most common causes of enteritis in people of all ages. It is an uncommon infection in neonates, who generally develop gastroenteritis when infected [151,732,[772], [773], [774], [775], [776], [777], [778], [779], [780], [781], [782], [783], [784], [785]]. Bacteremia with C. jejuni enteritis also is uncommon [732,773,778,783,[786], [787], [788], [789], [790], [791], [792]]. Maternal symptoms considered to be related to C. jejuni infection generally are mild and include fever (75%) and diarrhea (30%). In contrast to the serious disease in newborns that is caused by C. fetus, neonatal infections with C. jejuni usually result in a mild illness,*\nalthough meningitis occurs rarely [775,783]. Third-trimester infection related to C. fetus or C. jejuni may result in abortion or stillbirth.",

Increasing laboratory evidence suggests that the organisms are invasive and proinflammatory [728], similar to Shigella and Salmonella, although the mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. These organisms have been shown to produce an LT enterotoxin and a cytotoxin [[793], [794], [795], [796]]. This enterotoxin is known to be a heat-labile protein with a molecular mass of 60 to 70 MDa [793,796]. It shares functional and immunologic properties with cholera toxin and E. coli LT. C. jejuni and C. coli also elaborate a cytotoxin active against numerous mammalian cells [[797], [798], [799]]. The toxin is heat labile, trypsin sensitive, and not neutralized by immune sera to Shiga toxin or the cytotoxin of Clostridium difficile. The role of these toxins as virulence factors in diarrheal disease remains unproved [793,798].",

An established small mammal model that mimics human disease in the absence of previous treatment or surgical procedure has not been successful in adult mice [806]. An infant mouse model [807,808] and a hamster model [809] of diarrhea seem promising. C. jejuni is negative in the Sereny test for invasiveness [810], and most investigators report no fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops.",

The report of illness after ingestion of 106 organisms in a glass of milk [742] and production of illness in a single volunteer by 500 organisms [833] substantiate the variation in individual susceptibility. The potential for low-inoculum disease has significant implications for the importance of strict enteric precautions when infected persons are hospitalized, particularly in maternity and nursery areas. When diarrhea in neonates caused by C. jejuni has been reported [[772], [773], [774], [775], [776], [777], [778], [779], [780], [781], [782], [783], [784], [785]], maternal-infant transmission during labor has generally been documented [[772], [773], [774], [775], [776], [777],[779], [780], [781], [782],784,785]. The Lior serotyping system, restriction length polymorphism, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [834] have been used to confirm the identity of the infant and maternal isolates. Most mothers gave no history of diarrhea during pregnancy [776,777,779,780]. Outbreaks have occurred in neonatal intensive care units because of person-to-person spread [834].",

In a cohort study in Mexico, 66% of all infections related to C. jejuni were asymptomatic [746]. Infected children, if untreated, can be expected to excrete the organisms for 3 or 4 weeks; however, more than 80% are culture-negative after 5 weeks [735,736]. Asymptomatic excreters pose a significant risk in the neonatal period, in which acquisition from an infected mother can be clinically important [732,774,776,780]. C. jejuni has increasingly been recognized as a cause of watery and inflammatory diarrhea in temperate and tropical climates throughout the world. It has been isolated from 2% to 11% of all fecal cultures from patients with diarrheal illnesses in various parts of the world [[730], [731], [732], [733], [734], [735], [736], [737], [738],742,[838], [839], [840], [841], [842], [843]].

C. fetus often is carried asymptomatically in the intestinal or biliary tracts of sheep and cattle. During the course of a bacteremic illness in pregnant animals, C. fetus organisms, which have a high affinity for placental tissue, invade the uterus and multiply in the immunologically immature fetus. Infected fetuses generally are aborted. Whether this organism is acquired by humans from animals or is carried asymptomatically for long periods in humans, who may transmit the organism through sexual contact as apparently occurs in animals, is unclear. It is believed that this subspecies rarely is found in the human intestine and that it is not a cause of human enteritis [739].",

In several instances of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, C. fetus was isolated from culture of maternal cervix or vagina [725,761,809]. A nosocomial nursery outbreak has been associated with carriage in some healthy infants [845]. Other outbreaks have been associated with meningitis [846,847].

Most chickens in several different geographic locations had numerous (mean 4 \u00d7 106/g) C. jejuni in the lower intestinal tract or feces. This occurred in some instances despite the use of tetracycline, to which Campylobacter was susceptible in vitro, in the chicken feed [842]. The internal cavities of chickens remain positive for Campylobacter even after they have been cleaned, packaged, and frozen [848]. In contrast to Salmonella, C. jejuni organisms that survive usually do not multiply to high concentrations [739]. Domestic puppies or kittens with C. jejuni diarrhea also can provide a source for spread, especially to infants or small children [731,769,826,[850], [851], [852]].",

            "text": "\nC. jejuni infection typically involves the GI tract, producing watery diarrhea or a dysentery-like illness with fever and abdominal pain and stools that contain blood and mucus [729,746,814]. Older infants and children generally are affected, but neonates with diarrhea have been reported. Infection in neonates generally is not clinically apparent or is mild. Stools can contain blood, mucus, and pus [725,735,776,777]; fever often is absent [735,776]. The illness usually responds to appropriate antimicrobial therapy [774,776,830], which shortens the period of fecal shedding [859]. Extraintestinal infections related to C. jejuni other than bacteremia are rare, but include cholecystitis [860], urinary tract infection [861], and meningitis [775]. Bacteremia is a complication of GI infection [862], especially in malnourished children [863]. Meningitis that apparently occurs secondary to intestinal infection also has been reported in premature infants who have had intraventricular needle aspirations for neonatal hydrocephalus [725]. Complications in older children and adults that have been associated with C. jejuni enteritis include Reiter syndrome [864], Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [865,866], and reactive arthritis [867,868]. Persistent C. jejuni infections have been described in patients infected with HIV [869]. Extraintestinal manifestations generally occur in patients who are immunosuppressed or at the extremes of age [727]. C. lari has caused chronic diarrhea and bacteremia in a neonate [870].",

In the case of C. fetus infecting the bloodstream or central nervous system, blood culture flasks should be blindly subcultured and held for at least 7 days, or the organism may not be detected because of slow or inapparent growth [756]. The diagnosis of C. fetus infection should be considered when there is an unexplained febrile illness in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the event of recurrent abortion, prematurity, or neonatal sepsis with or without meningitis.

Growth at 42\u00b0 C in the presence of cephalosporins is used to culture selectively for C. jejuni from fecal specimens. In a study of six media, charcoal-based selective media and a modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar were the most selective for identification of Campylobacter species. Extending the incubation time from 48 to 72 hours led to an increase in the isolation rate regardless of the medium used [871].

In infants with C. jejuni gastroenteritis, limited data suggest that appropriate, early antimicrobial therapy results in improvement and rapid clearance of the organism from stool [859]. Campylobacter species are often resistant to \u03b2-lactams, including ampicillin and cephalosporins [874,875]. Most strains are susceptible to erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and the newer quinolones, although resistance to these agents has been reported [876,877]. A parenteral aminoglycoside seems to be the drug of choice for C. fetus infections, pending in vitro susceptibility studies. In the case of central nervous system involvement, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol are potential alternative drugs. Depending on in vitro susceptibilities, which vary with locale, erythromycin is the drug of choice for treating C. jejuni enteritis [731,735,736]. If erythromycin therapy is initiated within the first 4 days of illness, a reduction in excretion of the organism and resolution of symptoms occur [859].",

Because there seems to be an increased risk of toxicity with erythromycin estolate during pregnancy and infancy [878], other forms of erythromycin should probably be used in these settings. Azithromycin seems to be effective if the organism is susceptible [879]. Strains that are erythromycin resistant often are resistant to azithromycin [880].

Clustering of infected infants suggests that much of the colonization of newborn infants represents nosocomial spread [899], rather than acquisition of maternal flora. The number of C. difficile organisms present in stools of well infants is similar to that found in older patients with pseudomembranous colitis [903]. The high frequency of colonization has led to justified skepticism about the pathogenic potential of this organism in very young patients [904]. Although some episodes of diarrhea in early infancy may be caused by C. difficile [905], the high frequency of asymptomatic carriage in this age group suggests that neither colonization nor detection of toxin production is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of C. difficile diarrhea in an infant. Rather, other etiologies should be comprehensively sought, and C. difficile should be implicated in the absence of another pathogen.",

The usual reported vehicles of transmission have included contaminated water or ice; contaminated food, particularly raw or undercooked shellfish; moist grains held at ambient temperature; and raw or partially dried fish. The usual mode of infection is ingestion of contaminated food or water. Boiling water or treating it with chlorine or iodine and adequate cooking of food kill the organism [920]. Asymptomatic infection of family contacts is common, but direct person-to-person transmission of disease has not been documented.

This generalization also applies to the new O139 strains, although mild [930] and severe forms of illness have rarely been described in newborns [931]. Among 242 neonates admitted to a cholera research hospital in Dacca, Bangladesh, 25 infants were ill with cholera [932]. Even infants born to mothers with active diarrheal disease may escape infection, despite evidence that rice-water stools, almost certain to be ingested during the birth process, may contain 109 organisms/mL [932]. The reason for this apparently low attack rate among newborns is unknown; however, it probably can be attributed in large part to the protection conferred by breast-feeding [933]. Human milk contains antibodies [77] and receptor-like glycoprotein that inhibit adherence of V. cholerae [79] and gangliosides that bind cholera toxin [80]. The role of transplacentally acquired vibriocidal maternal antibodies has not been determined [934]. Because V. cholerae causes neither bacteremia nor intestinal invasion, protection against illness is more likely to be a function of mucosal rather than serum antibodies [935,936]. Additional factors that may reduce the incidence of neonatal cholera include the large inoculum required for infection [937] and the limited exposure of the newborn to the contaminated food and water [246].",

Infections of neonates have been reported [[1004], [1005], [1006], [1007]], but most cases of enteric disease currently reported in the United States are in adults [999].

An association between Providencia and neonatal enteritis has been substantiated largely by anecdotal reports of nursery outbreaks [232,287,1028,1059].

The upper small gut may become colonized with Candida in malnourished children with diarrhea [1068]; whether the presence of the organism is cause or effect is unclear. Stool cultures obtained from infants with diarrheal disease are inconclusive, and although Candida enteritis has been reported in adults [1069], the importance of this organism as a primary cause of neonatal gastroenteritis has been difficult to prove. Clinical descriptions of nursery epidemics of candidal enteritis are poorly documented, generally preceding the recognition of EPEC and rotaviruses as a cause of neonatal diarrhea. Even well-studied cases of intestinal involvement add little in the way of substantive proof because secondary invasion of Candida has been shown to be a complication of coliform enteritis [228,250,264].",

Early acquisition of disease tends to be more severe in young infants; rarely, amebic liver abscess and rapidly fatal colitis have been reported in infants [[1076], [1077], [1078], [1079], [1080], [1081], [1082], [1083], [1084]]. A 19-day-old infant from India who presented with 10 to 12 episodes of watery and mucous diarrhea, lethargy, jaundice, and mildly elevated liver enzymes has been described; the child recovered completely after 10 days of intravenous omidazole [1076]. Amebic liver abscess can be preceded by diarrhea or have a clinical presentation of fulminant neonatal sepsis [1077]. Asymptomatic colonization of neonates with various species of amebae is common in areas of high endemicity [1085].",

Child care center outbreaks reflecting person-to-person spread have shown its high infectivity potential [[1089], [1090], [1091], [1092]]. Food-borne transmission and water-borne transmission also occur. Infection is often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic; cases of severe symptomatic infection during the immediate newborn period have not been reported. Symptoms in giardiasis are related to the age of the patient: Diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and failure to thrive are more common in younger children. Seroprevalence studies showed evidence of past or current G. lamblia infection in 40% of Peruvian children by the age of 6 months [1093]. In a study of lactating Bangladeshi mothers and their infants, 82% of women and 42% of infants excreted Giardia once during the study; in some infants, this occurred before they were 3 months old [1094]. Of these infected infants, 86% had diarrhea, suggesting that the early exposure to the parasite resulted in disease. In a prospective study of diarrhea conducted in Mexico, infants frequently were infected with Giardia from birth to 2 months, with a crude incidence rate of first Giardia infection of 1.4 infections per child-year in this age group [10]. The symptom status of these children was not reported, but this study strongly suggests that G. lamblia may be more common than currently recognized among newborns living in developing areas.",

Infection in the first month of life has been described [1115,1116], Because symptoms resolve before excretion of oocysts ceases, a newborn whose mother has been ill with cryptosporidiosis in the month before delivery might be at risk even if the mother is asymptomatic at the time of the child's birth [1117]. With the increasing frequency of HIV infection, it is likely that women with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis may deliver an infant who will become infected. Infants infected early in life may develop chronic diarrhea and malnutrition [1118].",

Nitazoxanide is effective therapy of immunocompetent adults and children with cryptosporidiosis [1122]. Because illness is usually self-limited in the normal host, attention to fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional status is usually sufficient. Enteric isolation of hospitalized infants with this illness is appropriate because of the high infectivity. Several studies suggest that the risk of infection early in life may be decreased by breast-feeding [1116,1123], Using appropriate filtration systems in areas where water treatment is minimal can have a significant impact in decreasing cases of cryptosporidiosis [1124].",

Other viruses such as coronaviruses, Breda viruses, pestiviruses, parvoviruses, toroviruses, and picobirnaviruses have been sporadically associated with acute diarrhea, but are currently considered of uncertain relevance.

Rotavirus primarily infects mature enterocytes located in the mid and upper villous epithelium [[1147], [1148], [1149], [1150], [1151]]. Lactase, which is present only on the brush border of the differentiated epithelial cells at these sites, may act as a combined receptor and uncoating enzyme for the virus, permitting transfer of the particles into the cell [1152]. Perhaps for this reason, infection is limited to the mature columnar enterocytes; crypt cells and crypt-derived cuboidal cells, which lack a brush border, seem to be resistant to rotaviral infection [1152,1153]. This concept also may explain why rotavirus infection is less common in infants younger than 32 weeks' gestational age than in more mature infants [1154]; at 26 to 34 weeks' gestational age, lactase activity is approximately 30% of that found in term infants [1155].",

When infected, the villous enterocyte is sloughed, resulting in an altered mucosal architecture that becomes stunted and flattened. The gross appearance of the bowel is usually normal; however, under the dissecting microscope, scattered focal lesions of the mucosal surface are apparent in most cases. Light microscopy also shows patchy changes in villous morphology, compatible with a process of infection, inflammation, and accelerated mucosal renewal. The villi take on a shortened and blunt appearance as tall columnar cells are shed and replaced by less mature cuboidal enterocytes [1148,1150,1159]. Ischemia may also play a role in the loss and stunting of villi [1160] and activation of the enteric nervous system; active secretion of fluid and electrolytes may be another pathogenic mechanism [1161].",

            "text": "During the recovery phase, the enteroblastic cells mature and reconstruct the villous structure. Because of the loss of mature enterocytes on the tips of the villi, the surface area of the intestine is reduced. Diarrhea that occurs may be a result of this decrease in surface area, disruption in epithelial integrity, transient disaccharidase deficiency, or altered countercurrent mechanisms and net secretion of water and electrolytes [1148,1155,1157,[1161], [1162], [1163]]. More recent studies suggest that destruction of mature enterocytes does not seem to be a critical element in the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection. The role of NSP4 as a \u201cviral enterotoxin\u201d after the initial report of an age-dependent diarrhea in CD1 mice by triggering calcium-dependent chloride and water secretion [1164] has been supported by new studies [1165]. The exact mechanism of action of this protein at the intestinal level is only partially understood, but known to be different from the action of bacterial enterotoxins. NSP4 does not cause morphologic damage; it impairs glucose absorption and produces moderate calcium-mediated chloride secretion [1165]. The contribution of this \u201cviral enterotoxin\u201d in human rotavirus\u2013associated diarrhea is unclear [1166,1167].",

Most studies have indicated that serum and intestinal antirotavirus antibody levels are correlated with protection against infection [[1173], [1174], [1175], [1176], [1177], [1178], [1179], [1180], [1181]], although this correlation has not been universal [1182,1183]. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhea and specifically rotavirus disease during the first year of life [62,72], probably including newborns [1161]. The high prevalence of antirotaviral antibodies in colostrum and human milk has been shown by numerous investigators in widely diverse geographic areas [12]. Maternal rotavirus infection or immunization is accompanied by the appearance of specific antibodies in milk, probably through stimulation of the enteromammary immune system [[1184], [1185], [1186], [1187], [1188], [1189]]. Of women examined in London, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the United States, 90% to 100% had antirotaviral IgA antibodies in their milk for 2 years of lactation [12,[1184], [1185], [1186], [1187], [1188], [1189], [1190]]. Rotavirus-specific IgG antibodies have been found during the first few postpartum days in about one third of human milk samples assayed [1184,1187], whereas IgM antibodies were detectable in about half [1187].",

In a study from India, rotavirus positivity was detected in 56% of symptomatic neonates compared with 45% of asymptomatic neonates [1206]. Rotavirus has a mean incubation period of 2 days, with a range of 1 to 3 days in children and in adults experimentally infected. Fecal excretion of virus often begins a day or so before illness, and maximal excretion usually occurs during the 3rd and 4th days and generally diminishes by the end of the 1st week, although low concentrations of virus have been detected in neonates for 8 weeks [1155,[1204], [1205], [1206], [1207], [1208]].",

Exactly how the virus is introduced and transmitted is uncertain, although limited observations and experience with other types of enteric disease in maternity units suggest several possibilities. The early appearance of virus in stools of some neonates indicates that infection probably was acquired at delivery. Virus particles can be detected on the 1st [59,1204] or 2nd [1217] day of life in many infected infants. By day 3 or 4, most infected infants who will shed virus, with or without signs of illness, are doing so [1192,1204,1217]. The numerous virus particles excreted [1192,1217] suggest a fairly large and early oral inoculum. It is unlikely that contamination from any source other than maternal feces could provide an inoculum large enough to cause infection by the 2nd day.",

There are numerous reports of nosocomial and day care center rotavirus gastroenteritis outbreaks that attest to the ease with which this agent spreads through a hospital or institutional setting [1126]. Admission of a symptomatic infant usually is the initiating event, although transfer of a neonate with inapparent infection from one ward to another also has been incriminated. The most important factors influencing the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea in a nursery are the proximity to other newborns and the frequency of hand washing [1205]. During a 4-month study, infants cared for by nursing staff and kept in communal nurseries experienced three epidemics of diarrhea with attack rates of 20% to 50%. During the same period, only 2% of infants rooming in with their mothers became ill, even though they had frequent contact with adult relatives and siblings.",

The respiratory isolation achieved by placing an infant in a closed incubator is not fully protective, however [1205]. No evidence indicates that transplacental or ascending intrauterine infection occurs.

The presence of unusual antigenic types, such as P2A [6] type, within nurseries also suggests \u201cless virulent strains.\u201d At least 10 rotavirus strains were documented to cocirculate in a tertiary care center during a 2-month period [1227], and in a different setting the same rotavirus strains by electropherotype produced asymptomatic infection in neonates and symptomatic infection in older infants [1201]. Newborns within a nursery exposed to a given rotavirus strain can develop symptomatic or asymptomatic infection [1143,1228,1229]. P8 [11], G10 was the most common genotype associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in a tertiary care hospital in India [1206].

Early signs of illness, such as lethargy, irritability, vomiting, and poor feeding, usually are followed in a few hours by the passage of watery yellow or green stools free of blood but sometimes containing mucus [1205,[1230], [1231], [1232]]. Diarrhea usually decreases by the 2nd day of illness and is much improved by the 3rd or 4th day. Occasionally, intestinal fluid loss and poor weight gain may continue for 1 or 2 weeks, particularly in low birth weight infants [1193]. Although reducing substances frequently are present in early fecal samples [191,1154,1194,1205], this finding is not abnormal in neonates, particularly infants who are breast-fed [1233]. Nevertheless, infants with prolonged diarrhea should be investigated for monosaccharide or disaccharide malabsorption or intolerance to cow's milk protein or both [1234]. In a prospective study [1203], 49% of newborns with GI symptoms in a neonatal intensive care unit had rotavirus detected in their stools. Frequent stooling (present in 60%), bloody mucoid stool (42%), and watery stools (24%) were risk factors for a rotavirus infection. Bloody mucoid stools, intestinal dilation, and abdominal distention were significantly more common in preterm infants, but severe outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis and death did not differ among infected term and preterm infants.",

Rotavirus infection may play a role in a small proportion of cases of necrotizing enterocolitis, although it probably represents one of many potential triggering factors [1206]. A significant association between neonatal rotavirus infection and bradycardia-apnea episodes was detected in one prospective study [1238]. The possible association between natural rotavirus infection and intussusception [[1239], [1240], [1241]] gained support after the association was made between the human-simian reassortant vaccine and intussusception in infants older than 2 months (attributable risk approximately 1:10,000) [1242]. Epidemiologic studies have not shown a temporal correlation between peaks of rotavirus infection and increase in cases of intussusception [1243]. Intussusception is extremely uncommon in the newborn; it is highly unlikely that rotavirus triggers this disease in neonates.",

Intravenous fluids may be needed in neonates who are severely dehydrated, who have ileus, or who refuse to feed. Persistent or recurrent diarrhea after introduction of milk-based formulas or human milk warrants investigation for secondary carbohydrate or milk protein intolerance [1154,1235].

Because rotavirus is often excreted several days before illness is recognized, isolation of an infant with diarrhea may be too late to prevent cross-infection, unless all nursing personnel and medical staff have adhered to this fundamental precaution. Infants who develop gastroenteritis should be moved out of the nursery area if adequate facilities are available and the infant's condition permits transfer. The use of an incubator is valuable in reducing transmission of disease only by serving as a reminder that proper hand hygiene and glove techniques are required, but is of little value as a physical barrier to the spread of virus [1205]. Encouraging rooming-in of infants with their mothers has been shown to be helpful in preventing or containing nursery epidemics [1261].

After approximately 500,000 children were vaccinated with more than 1 million doses, a significantly increased risk of intussusception was observed among vaccinated children, with an overall odds ratio of 1.8 [1262]. Use of this vaccine was terminated. Two new vaccines proved to be safe and effective in large phase III trials: a vaccine including five bovine-human reassortant strains including human G types G1-G4 and P type P1A [8] and a vaccine including one human attenuated P1A [8], G1.",

Physicians need to consider the infant's previous frequency and consistency of stools and establish a diagnosis of acute diarrhea on an individual basis.

The most common initiating factor is a primary infection of the GI tract that is mild to moderate in severity, self-limited, and responsive to supportive measures. Acute diarrhea can also be an initial manifestation of a systemic infection, including bacterial and viral neonatal sepsis. Infants with moderate to severe diarrhea require close monitoring until the etiologic diagnosis and the clinical evolution are clarified. Noninfectious diseases leading to chronic intractable diarrhea may result in severe nutritional disturbances or even death unless the specific underlying condition is identified and treated appropriately. The differential diagnosis of a diarrheal illness requires a careful clinical examination to determine whether the child has a localized or a systemic process. Lethargy, abnormalities in body temperature, hypothermia or hyperthermia, decreased feeding, abdominal distention, vomiting, pallor, respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, hypotension, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, coagulation or bleeding disorders, petechiae, and exanthemas should lead to an intense laboratory investigation directed at systemic viral or bacterial infection. If the process is deemed a localized intestinal infection, initial evaluation can be focused on differentiating an inflammatory-invasive pathogen from pathogens that cause a noninflammatory process. For this, stool examination for fecal leukocytes, red blood cells, and lactoferrin can be a helpful indicator of the former.",

Noninflammatory causes of diarrhea include ETEC, EPEC, rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, calicivirus, astrovirus, G. lamblia, and Cryptosporidium. V. cholerae can cause severe life-threatening neonatal diarrhea in regions where the infection is endemic [1271]. Cytomegalovirus can cause mild to severe enteritis that may result in ileal stricture [1272]. Enteroviruses can cause outbreaks of fever, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms in newborn units [1273]. Although supportive fluid therapy is mandatory for all types of diarrhea, the brief examination for fecal leukocytes and red blood cells can direct the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Pathogens such as Shigella, Salmonella, and EHEC can cause watery or bloody diarrhea, depending on the specific host-pathogen interaction and the pathogenic mechanisms involved.
