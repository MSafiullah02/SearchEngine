The COVID-19 is a previously unknown disease with no tools available for pharmaceutical management at the early stage of its outbreak. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan was locked down and all provinces and regions across China imposed antiviral prophylaxis, quarantines, school closures, travel restrictions, and social distancing by implementing the ''first-level response to major public health emergencies\" during the period 23-25 January 2020. The case confirmation speed during this period improved due to development of new coronavirus nucleic acid-based detection technologies [2] .",

Epidemic modeling is one of the essential tools for both developing strategies in preparation for the outbreak and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies during the outbreak.

This concept has been widely used and improved since then. The R 0 provides an indication of whether the introduction of the disease will result in a localized burnout or signal the beginning of an epidemic that could move through all geographic scales [6] . A timely estimation on R 0 of the COVID-19 epidemic may prove beneficial in understanding how to control the worldwide spread of the epidemic [7] .",

The transmission rate of an infectious disease is defined as the per capita rate of infection given contact, which can be expressed as the product of the number of daily contacts that a susceptible individual has with other individuals and the probability of transmission during each contact [9] . In other words, a more highly infectious disease has a higher transmission rate. However, we need to know the transmission rate if we want to predict the changes of an epidemic disease. Determining the time-dependent transmission function that exactly reproduces disease incidence data can yield useful information about disease outbreaks, including a range of potential values for the recovery rate of the disease. If the time-dependent transmission function is constructed, information regarding intervention and stopping the outbreak can be obtained.",

            "text": "After the intervention of locking down Wuhan city on 23 January 2020, R 0 started to have an oscillatory decrease in Wuhan city. The implementation of the ''first-level response to major public health emergencies\" in all provinces and regions in the whole of China from 23 to 25 January, 2020 monotonously decreased R 0 in Hubei Province since 26 January 2020. R 0 decreased to < 2 on 9 and 11 February 2020 in Hubei Province and Wuhan city respectively. The decline of R 0 to below 2 indicates that they have passed the major outbreak. However, COVID-19 continued to spread across Hubei until R 0 dropped below 1 on 16 February 2020 for Hubei and on 17 February 2020 for Wuhan, meaning that the COVID-19 has been under control since 17 February 2020. The fitted equations (see the Supplementary materials online) demonstrate that R 0 is decreasing to its minima and will stay on stable levels in a short time for Hubei and Wuhan, respectively.",

In addition, both the temporal and spatial models need to be improved methodologically. A robust temporal model for the spread of an infectious disease should incorporate the following information [14] : the patterns of contacts among infectious and susceptible individuals, the latency period from being infected to becoming infectious, the duration of infectiousness, and the extent of immunity acquired following infection. Once all of these factors are formulated in a model, we will be able to construct the entire epidemic curves describing the expected number of individuals who will be infected, the duration of the epidemic, the peak incidence, and the expected number of cases at each point in time.
