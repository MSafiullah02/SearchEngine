In recent years, advances in human B cell isolation techniques have led to the identification of large numbers of therapeutic mAb candidates against many life-threatening viral pathogens. These targets include antigenically variable viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Sok and Burton, 2018) and influenza virus (Laursen and Wilson, 2013), or newly emerging pathogens with high epidemic potential, including Ebola virus (Bornholdt et al., 2016), Marburg virus (Flyak et al., 2015), Zika virus (Sapparapu et al., 2016, Stettler et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016b), Lassa virus (Robinson et al., 2016), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Corti et al., 2016b), poxviruses (Gilchuk et al., 2016), Nipah virus (Geisbert et al., 2014), and many other medically important viruses. Over 25 antiviral human mAbs are now being evaluated as human therapeutics in clinical trials (Walker and Burton, 2018), including several for ebolavirus therapy (NIH, 2019).",

            "text": "Antibodies can mediate protection by direct virus neutralization and/or by engagement of innate immune cells via their Fc receptors (FcRs) (Crowe, 2017, Lu et al., 2018). Potent neutralization, broad reactivity, and protective capacity are desirable mAb features, which could be used to select leads for development as a monotherapy or cocktail. A cocktail might offer greater efficacy and resistance to viral escape (Corti et al., 2016a, Keeffe et al., 2018, Wec et al., 2019), but the molecular and structural basis for the optimal combination of mAbs is ill-defined. Current mAb discovery approaches typically are focused on antibody variable fragment (Fv)-region-mediated biological functions of single isolated mAbs (e.g., binding and neutralization) or Fc-region-mediated effector functions (Walker and Burton, 2018). Molecular interactions in which two or more mAbs recognize the same antigen in an enhanced (e.g., cooperative or synergistic) fashion are less well investigated, but these interactions might contribute greatly to the overall efficacy of protective cocktails (Carlsen et al., 2014, Doria-Rose et al., 2012, Howell et al., 2017, Mascola et al., 1997). One key challenge that impedes progress in this area is that the structural determinants of cooperativity by neutralizing antibodies are poorly understood. Development of synergistic mAb cocktails against viruses with high antigenic variability, including HIV, hepatitis C, norovirus, influenza virus, or Ebola virus, is also thwarted by the fact that only a small subset of virus-specific mAbs available for incorporation in cocktails is broadly cross-reactive to all field strains. Another challenge is the relatively small number of mAb combinations that can be tested iteratively for therapeutic efficacy given the high cost and labor of in vivo virus challenge studies, especially when non-human primate (NHP) large animal model testing is needed. Therefore, for the rational development of antiviral therapeutic mAb cocktails it is important to implement approaches to identify combinations of mAbs with optimized molecular interactions in formulated cocktails, along with structural and functional analysis to define features that mediate efficient protection by these mAbs.",

EBOV causes a severe disease in humans with 25% to 90% case fatality rates and significant epidemic potential. The largest epidemic to date occurred in 2013\u20132016 in West Africa with a total of 28,646 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and 11,323 deaths reported (Coltart et al., 2017). This and the new ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (CDC, 2019) highlighted the need to accelerate development of EVD therapeutics (Park et al., 2015, Urbanowicz et al., 2016). The ebolavirus envelope (E) contains a single surface protein, the glycoprotein (GP), which is the major target for neutralizing mAbs (Lee and Saphire, 2009). We conducted analysis of >1,800 human mAbs against the GP and identified two classes of broadly reactive mAbs that cooperate for binding to the GP and neutralization of the virus. High-resolution structures illuminated a mechanism of cooperativity. The two-antibody cocktail offered protection in mice against the most antigenically divergent virus SUDV and demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy against live EBOV challenge in NHPs. These findings offered a rational strategy for development of a potent two-antibody cocktail design based on structural features of mAb interactions with ebolavirus GPs.",

This work also revealed the class of non-competing, glycan-cap-region-specific mAbs that enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 to the GP in a cooperative manner (Gilchuk et al., 2018), suggesting a strategy for two-antibody cocktail design.

We expressed the variable gene sequences for this mAb in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a recombinant IgG1-LALA Fc mutant molecule (rEBOV-520 LALA, or rEBOV-520) to diminish Fc effector function. rEBOV-520 LALA possessed the highest protective efficacy with low-dose treatment against EBOV in mice (Kuzmina et al., 2018) and acted principally via neutralization to protect against EBOV (Gilchuk et al., 2018). The second cocktail partner, mAb EBOV-548, potently neutralized EBOV and showed the highest activity of three identified cooperative glycan-cap-specific mAbs in a cooperative binding to the GP with rEBOV-520 as a partner mAb. EBOV-548 was produced as a functionally competent IgG1 (designated here as rEBOV-548 IgG1 or rEBOV-548), because engagement of the Fc region might be important for protection by the GP glycan-cap-specific mAbs (Gunn et al., 2018).",

The SNAP-tag is a self-labeling protein tag that allows specific labeling of a target cell line with fluorescent dye, facilitating detection of effector-cell-mediated killing activity by flow cytometry (Domi et al., 2018). rEBOV-520 LALA showed low cytotoxic activity when compared with that of the control rEBOV-520 WT IgG1. rEBOV-548 IgG1 mediated efficient cell killing that was comparable to that of a recombinant form of a glycan-cap-directed mAb c13C6, which is included in the ZMapp\u2122 cocktail (Figure 1\nA) (Davidson et al., 2015). Similar functional profiles of these two mAbs were obtained using bead- or solid-phase-immobilized GP ectodomains and various human effector cells (Figures S1A and S1C).

We then tested mAb binding to each of the three Jurkat GP cell lines after treatment with thermolysin to mimic endosomal cathepsin cleavage to create a membrane-displayed cleaved GP (GPCL). rEBOV-520 bound weakly to the intact GP but strongly to the GPCL, demonstrating a saturable dose-response curve and \u223c500- to \u223c1,000-fold increase in binding to the GPCL over the intact GP (Figure 1C). More efficient binding to the GPCL was concordant with higher neutralizing activity of EBOV-520 against the virus displaying the EBOV GPCL than the virus with the intact EBOV GP that we described in a previous study (Gilchuk et al., 2018). The glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 bound moderately and less efficiently to intact cell-surface-displayed GPs when compared with its binding to recombinant GPs (Figures 1C and S1B).

To characterize the cooperative effects of these two mAbs as a cocktail, we first assessed GP binding for each mAb in the presence or absence of the partner mAb. Fluorescently labeled rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 was titrated into a constant concentration of unlabeled partner mAb, as previously described (Gilchuk et al., 2018), and relative fluorescence from binding of the labeled mAb to the intact cell-surface-displayed EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GP was determined. At a constant concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL, rEBOV-548 enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to the GPs of all three ebolaviruses 2- to 3-fold when compared with binding of rEBOV-520 alone. The cooperativity was mediated by rEBOV-548, because rEBOV-520 had a minor effect on binding of rEBOV-548 to the GP (Figure 2B). Cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact homologous EBOV GP increased steadily with increased concentrations of rEBOV-548 and up to \u223c5-fold higher than rEBOV-520 alone (Figure 2C), indicating that a higher dose of rEBOV-548 would be necessary to leverage strong cooperative effect in a two-antibody cocktail. Binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact GP in the cocktail did not fully match the strong saturating binding of rEBOV-520 by itself to the proteolytically primed GPCL (Figure 2C). Therefore, binding of rEBOV-548 only partially enhanced accessibility of the base epitope on the intact GP for recognition by rEBOV-520, compared with the accessibility to the epitope on GPCL.",

Consistent with the observed increase in cooperative binding of the SUDV GP (Figure S2A), rEBOV-548 at a sub-neutralizing concentration potentiated the neutralizing activity of rEBOV-520 against chimeric virus displaying the SUDV GP by reducing the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value by \u223c3-fold (Figure 2D). Neutralization by the cocktail was synergistic, as determined by the Chou and Talalay method that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination: additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI >1) (Chou, 2010). We also demonstrated synergy in neutralization of the virus with the homologous EBOV GP using the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) (Figures S2B and S2C).

An irrelevant mAb DENV 2D22 (IgG1 isotype) specific to the dengue virus E protein (Fibriansah et al., 2015) was used as a control. All SUDV-challenged mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg of rEBOV-548 mAb alone (which does not neutralize SUDV) on day 1 after infection succumbed to the disease by day 6 after infection, similarly to the animals in the control group. Treatment with rEBOV-520 alone delayed mortality; however, only 10% of animals survived. Treatment with the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) conferred higher protection, with 50% of animals surviving and an associated p value = 0.01 (Mantel-Cox test) when compared with the treatment with rEBOV-520 alone (Figure 2E). These results showed that rEBOV-548 complemented the activity of rEBOV-520 against SUDV in vivo. It is unknown whether protection in this model can predict protection against SUDV in NHPs.",

We hypothesized that the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 counteracts the escape more efficiently than individual mAbs do because each mAb possesses independent neutralizing activity (EBOV and BDBV at least) and together they exhibit an enhanced activity. We used high-throughput and quantitative real-time cell analysis assay (RTCA) that measures virus-induced cytopathic effect to screen for escape mutations in the presence of individual mAbs or the cocktail (Figures S2D and S2E). Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) displaying the EBOV GP (rVSV/EBOV GP) or SUDV GP (rVSV/SUDV GP) were incubated in the presence of increasing mAb concentrations, and we assessed neutralization in repeated passages in Vero cell monolayer cultures. Viruses escaping neutralization were assessed for susceptibility to neutralization by individual mAbs or the cocktail, and the genes encoding the GP were sequenced to confirm the presence of an escape mutation. Fifteen consecutive passages identified two rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 and one rVSV/SUDV GP mutant that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-520. Each of the mutants that we detected was selected in the presence of an individual mAb, and the mutations identified were within the predicted epitope for the respective mAb (Table S2). Virus escape was not detected in passages in the presence of the cocktail, as confirmed by neutralization of the late passage viruses with individual mAbs rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548. The rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 that we isolated were neutralized fully by rEBOV-520 alone and by the cocktail, showing that if one neutralizing mAb loses activity because of a virus variant with an escape mutation, the other neutralizing mAb in the cocktail maintained activity (Table S2). These data strongly suggest that the use of this cocktail enhances the effective neutralizing potency of the mAbs and counteracts virus escape of the homologous EBOV. Although escape was not detected with the cocktail, the rEBOV-520 escape mutant we identified for rVSV/SUDV GP (N514Y, a conserved residue for EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP) was not fully neutralized by either mAb rEBOV-548 alone or by the cocktail, suggesting the possibility of escape by the heterologous SUDV.",

The rEBOV-520 Fab bound to the base of each protomer of GPCL, and the constant domains were oriented upward from the viral membrane (Figure 3C). The rEBOV-520 footprint includes relatively conserved regions including the internal fusion loop (IFL) stem of the GP2 subunit and the hydrophobic pocket formed by five residues of the GP1 subunit and termed previously the \u201c310\u201d pocket (Zhao et al., 2016, West et al., 2019). The footprint of rEBOV-520 is distinct from that of the previously described broad human base-specific mAb ADI-15878 (Murin et al., 2018, West et al., 2018) but is similar to the footprint of the potent human-base-specific mAb ADI-15946 (Figure 3D), which fully neutralizes EBOV and BDBV but not SUDV (Wec et al., 2017, West et al., 2019). Both ADI-15946 and rEBOV-520 bound to the 310 pocket and IFL stem regions of the fusion loop, unlike human mAb ADI-15878, which binds to the hydrophobic loop end of the structure and bridges to a neighboring GP protomer (King et al., 2019). However, rEBOV-520 likely gained reactivity against SUDV by having a footprint slightly higher on the GP base than the ADI-15946, or a different angle of approach than that of ADI-15946, which was directed downward toward the viral membrane (Figure 3C), in contrast to ADI-15946, which is directed upward from the membrane (West et al., 2019). This footprint allowed the mAb to avoid contact with the non-conserved EBOV GP residue N506 (R506 in SUDV GP) in the interface with rEBOV-520 (Figure 3D)\u2014a key contact residue for binding with complementarity determining region 3 of heavy chain (CDRH3) of ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019).

The 18-amino-acid-long CDRH3 interacted with a conformational epitope on the GP1-GP2 interface by making direct contacts with 13 GP1 (aa 70\u201378, 106, 107, 127, and 139) and 5 GP2 (aa 510\u2013514) residues that are relatively conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV (Figure S3A). rEBOV-520 bound to the 310 pocket of the GPCL formed by GP1 residues 70\u201378 (all contacted with CDRH3) and GP2 residues 510\u2013516 (four of seven contacted with CDRH3) that line the bottom part of the pocket (Figure 4\nA). In the unbound, full-length GP, the 310 pocket normally is occupied by the flexible descending \u03b217-\u03b218 loop of the glycan cap (GP1 residues 287\u2013291) that impedes access to the pocket. Like ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019), rEBOV-520 either bound to a conformation of GP in which the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop is displaced, or actively displaced it from the pocket upon binding. The loop is not present in the GPCL, being removed by cleavage. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to compare deuterium labeling of peptides generated after digestion of the GP and GPCL with pepsin. Decrease in labeling of GP 310 pocket residues involved in the interface with CDRH3 confirmed limited accessibility of rEBOV-520 epitope in a structure of intact GP trimer (Figure 4A and S3B). Cleavage removes the glycan cap with the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop and exposes the pocket, which explained enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to GPCL (Figure 1C) and enhanced neutralization potency of this mAb against virions bearing the GPCL compared with intact GP (Gilchuk et al., 2018).",

However, unlike with FVM09, whose binding was fully abolished by several alanine mutations in the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop (Howell et al., 2017), none of the alanine mutations within the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop reduced rEBOV-548 binding to the GP (data not shown). Rather, alanine substitutions in several residues of the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop, which are distal to the rEBOV-548 epitope in the upper portion of the glycan cap, increased rEBOV-520 binding by \u223c1.6- to 3-fold compared with binding to the wild-type GP (Figure 4B). This suggested that rEBOV-548 does not bind to the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop, and binding to the loop itself is not required for cooperative enhancement of rEBOV-520 binding.",

            "text": "Unlike the previously described mAb FVM09, our structure revealed that rEBOV-548 does not bind directly to the \u03b217- \u03b218 loop. Instead, the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 directly interacted with the \u03b217 strand (residues 272\u2013275) of GP1, forming an extended beta sheet with the glycan cap, including highly conserved critical epitope residues I274 and W275 that were defined by loss of binding with alanine substitution and L273, for which mutation to proline resulted in loss of neutralizing activity. rEBOV-548, similarly to EBOV-442, inhibited glycan cap cleavage, which could be the molecular basis for neutralizing activity by these mAbs (Gilchuk et al., 2018). Two non-conserved GP1 residues Y261 and R266, whose mutation to alanine decreased binding of rEBOV-548 (Figure 3B), did not directly contact the rEBOV-548 paratope and were not within the cleavage site. In the SUDV GP, natural mutations Y261H and R266L affected rEBOV-548 activity in a similar way by lowering the EC50 for binding and reducing its neutralizing potency (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B), suggesting destabilization of the epitope by these adjacent mutations. In both rEBOV-548 Fab alone and rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 Fab bound states, the \u03b218-\u03b218\u2032 domain, C-terminal of the GP \u03b217-\u03b218 loop was displaced and structurally mimicked by the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 (Figures 5B and S4). The rEBOV-548 LC contacted GP1 through hydrophobic interactions at the loop between \u03b11 and \u03b217 (residues 268 and 269) and through Q27L1 contacting residue D117, making a possible H-bond with the backbone of D117 (Figure 5C) that anchors the mAb to the inner chalice of the GP (Figure 5A). We observed rEBOV-548-mediated destabilization and dissociation of the GP trimer (Figure S5A). Such a dissociation was limited in the presence of the stalk-specific mAb ADI-16061 that was used to stabilize the GP for cryo-EM with rEBOV-548. It is unclear whether this disruption seen with soluble GPs also occurs in membrane-anchored GPs or whether it contributes to the synergy. Analysis of rEBOV-520 interactions in the structure of rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 bound to the GP showed that the rEBOV-520 CDRH3 loop makes additional contacts beyond the 310 pocket when the glycan cap is intact. These contacts include Y108H3 with K510 in GP2, Y106H3 with T77 in GP1, and T104H3 with P250 in the base of the \u03b11 loop of GP1. The rEBOV-520 CDRH3 residue W100H3 bound to N512 in GP2, displacing the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop and mimicking the N512 interaction with W291GP1 of the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop in the unliganded structure (Figure 5D). Residues T77, K510, and N512 were highly conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs. Of note, our previous study identified N512 as a key epitope residue for rEBOV-520, given that N512A mutation reduced binding to the GP (Gilchuk et al., 2018). Therefore, for efficient binding rEBOV-520 must overcome interference of the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop (at W291GP1) and \u03b11 helix (at P250GP1) contained in the glycan cap structure (Figure 5E). When two Fabs of the cocktail bound to the GP, the \u03b218-\u03b218\u2032 region is displaced and the glycan cap pulled back, along with the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop, to allow efficient binding of rEBOV-520 (Figure 5F). However, in a structure where rEBOV-548 bound to the GP alone, the glycan cap was not displaced to the degree it was when rEBOV-520 was bound but rather is reminiscent of the structure of unliganded GP. Although the \u03b218 and \u03b218\u2032 strands are displaced and replaced by rEBOV-548 CDRH3, the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop is largely intact and bound to the base of the IFL, blocking the 310 pocket (Figure S4). Comparing solvent exclusion, the unliganded GP and the GP in a complex with rEBOV-548 alone appeared very similar, except for in the \u03b218-\u03b218\u2032 domain. Most of the region where the rEBOV-520 CDR3 bound was still excluded and the \u03b11 helix was not displaced (Figure S5B), consistent with our observation that rEBOV-548 did not fully potentiate binding of rEBOV-520. These data suggested that in the cocktail, rEBOV-520 alone was largely responsible for complete displacement of the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop as well as displacing the \u03b11 helix in the cocktail, whereas rEBOV-548 acted by displacement of the \u03b218-\u03b218\u2032 domain and the C-terminal portion of the \u03b217-\u03b218 loop, alleviating structural and kinetic restraints for efficient rEBOV-520 binding (Figure S6).",

Rhesus macaques were assigned to one treatment group of five animals. After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Kikwit variant of EBOV, all NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail (1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) spaced 3 days apart (days 3 and 6 after infection). An additional animal was studied as a contemporaneous control and was left untreated, along with ten historical untreated controls (7 days post-infection [dpi] median survival, inoculated by the same route with the same stock of virus). The control untreated animal developed a high clinical score and succumbed to the disease on day 6 after infection. The two-dose therapeutic cocktail treatment provided complete protection of NHPs from mortality and clinical signs of EVD (Figures 7\nA, 7B, and S7). Before the first treatment (day 3 after infection) three of five NHPs from the treatment-designated group and also the control untreated NHP developed detectable viremia; plasma titers ranged from 6.7 log10 to 7.3 log10 genome equivalents (GEQs) per mL, as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 7C). The plasma titer of infectious virus that was assessed by plaque assay on day 3 after infection was below the limit of detection in all animals. However, by day 6 after infection, the viral load in all untreated animals, including in the NHP control from this study and in the historical controls, was as high as >5 log10PFU/mL or >11 log10 GEQ/mL (Figures 7C and S7). Concordant with full protection, by day 6 after infection all treated NHPs, including three registered as highly viremic on day 3 after infection, no longer had detectable viremia in the plasma. In various tissues harvested from treated animals on day 28 after infection, qRT-PCR analysis, which detects both infectious and non-infectious neutralized particles that have not yet been cleared, revealed virus, confirming active EBOV infection in all NHPs in the treatment group before treatment (Table S5). We next assessed changes in blood chemistries that are typically associated with EVD to further characterize the efficacy of the mAb cocktail treatment (Table S6). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are indicators of EVD, were elevated in untreated NHPs on day 6 after infection\u2014the peak of viremia and the disease (Figures 7B and 7C). Treated animals did not show signs of acute liver injury on day 6 after infection or later time points, displaying low amounts of ALT, GGT, ALP when compared with those of untreated NHP (Figure 7D; Table S6). To probe the possibility of selection of escape mutants in the presence of the cocktail, we assessed several peripheral tissues for the presence of live infectious virus to cover all NHPs and using a range of tissues that had the higher number of viral genomes detected by the qRT-PCR. All tested tissues from treated NHPs were confirmed to be negative for live virus on day 28 after infection, showing that the cocktail treatment provided sterilizing immunity (Figure 7E). Human IgG capture ELISA of serum samples revealed that circulating cocktail mAbs in the treated NHPs ranged from 125 to 460 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 7F). Given the relevance of such high mAb concentration for strong cooperative interactions (Figure 2C), cooperativity mediated by the cocktail likely contributed to the effectiveness of treatment.",

MBP134AF is a two-antibody cocktail with pan-ebolavirus activity that demonstrated efficacy in NHPs (Bornholdt et al., 2019). REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail (Pascal et al., 2018), and mAb114 is a single mAb that is specific to the receptor binding site of the GP (Corti et al., 2016a)\u2014both are monospecific to EBOV. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 were recently assessed in the field in the DRC outbreak of human EVD, and early treatment was associated with reduction of the mortality rate to 6% with REGN-EB3 or to 11% with mAb114 (Nature News, 2019). mAb114 is the only EBOV antibody described that has been shown so far to protect NHPs in monotherapy settings. Even so, the protection mediated by the cocktail of mAb114 + mAb100 was better than that mediated by mAb114 alone (Corti et al., 2016a). In the cocktail, there is also the potential benefit of avoiding the high risk of virus escape that is inherent in monotherapy approaches. Targeting cross-reactive epitopes might be another approach to reduce the viral escape, given that conserved regions are more likely to be critical for the virus function. Therefore, having a single broad cocktail that is at least as effective as the existing monospecific cocktail against EBOV would be practical. The cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 was formulated to add a principle of cooperativity (e.g., incorporation of a pair of non-competing and potently neutralizing mAbs that together exhibit an enhanced activity). Therefore, in addition to the reactivity breadth that extended to BDBV and SUDV, the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 incorporated four principal activities against homologous EBOV: the independent neutralizing activities of (1) rEBOV-520 and (2) rEBOV-548, (3) an enhanced combined activity because of synergy in the cocktail, and (4) Fc-mediated effector function by rEBOV-548. A comparison to the historical NHPs studies with REGN-EB3, mAb114, and MBP134AF qualifies the cocktail of EBOV-520 and EBOV-548 as highly protective against EBOV. The next studies should determine whether this cocktail protects NHPs against heterologous ebolaviruses.",

Several studies identified the IFL as a site of vulnerability for potent mAbs that can act solely by neutralization to protect (Gilchuk et al., 2018, Wec et al., 2017). MAbs recognizing glycan cap epitopes have been considered as inferior for therapeutic development because of possible cross-reactivity with soluble GPs (sGPs) (Mohan et al., 2012). Recent studies, however, suggested an indispensable role for Fc-mediated effector functions in the protection against EBOV by glycan-cap-specific mAbs (Gunn et al., 2018). It was unknown whether these functions (e.g., neutralizing activity and Fc engagement) in the cocktail of these two mAb specificities were essential and sufficient for efficacy in NHPs. Our study suggested that both functions could be important for virus control and EVD prevention by showing that the cocktail of the Fc-function-competent IgG1 form of glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 and functionally impaired IgG1-LALA form of neutralizing IFL-specific rEBOV-520 mediated therapeutic protection in NHPs.",

Therefore, this work defines cooperative interactions between mAbs of the two major epitope specificities for GP recognition, and unveils cooperative binding of the GP as a mechanism for the enhanced ebolavirus neutralization and protection.

This study revealed that binding of two broadly-reactive glycan cap specific mAbs increases binding of broadly-neutralizing and highly protective base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 (Gilchuk et al., 2018). Here, for the development of cooperative mAb cocktail, we performed a comprehensive screening from \u223c1,800 individual GP-reactive B cell line supernatants (\u223c1,100 from this study and \u223c750 from previous study with the DRC outbreak survivor) to identify a suitable partner mAb for these potent base-specific mAb. The criteria for down-selection of the partner mAb candidates included (a) high neutralizing activity against live pathogenic virus (neutralizing at least EBOV); (b) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP; (c) synergistic activity that was defined as the ability of mAb to enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 (at least 2-fold enhancement) when compared to binding of the base-specific mAb alone; and (d) efficacy of monotherapy in mice to protect against live EBOV challenge. Supernatants from each well of the 384-well culture plates with expanded hybridoma lines first were assessed for neutralizing activity against live EBOV using one 1:5 supernatant dilution in 96-well plate format as detailed below in the Neutralization assays section. Next, hybridoma lines that fully neutralized EBOV at the supernatant dilution tested were assessed by ELISA for reactivity against recombinant EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP. The broadly-reactive clones identified were tested for neutralizing activity against live BDBV and SUDV. Hybridoma cell lines producing cross-reactive and neutralizing mAbs (mAbs that reacted to all three GPs and neutralized at least EBOV and BDBV) were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning). Purified mAbs were tested using a competition-binding assay with intact Jurkat-EBOV GP (A) or thermolysin cleaved Jurkat-EBOV GPCL to identify major antigenic sites.",

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). A modified 5\u2032RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) approach was used (Turchaninova et al., 2016). Briefly, 5 \u03bcL total RNA was mixed with cDNA synthesis primer mix (10 \u03bcM each) and incubated for 2 min at 70\u00b0C and then decrease the incubation temperature to 42\u00b0C to anneal the synthesis primers (1-3 min). After incubation, a mixture containing 5X first-strand buffer (Clontech), DTT (20 mM), 5\u2032 template switch oligo (10 \u03bcM), dNTP solution (10 mM each) and 10X SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) was added to the primer-annealed total RNA reaction and incubated for 60 min at 42\u00b0C. The first-strand synthesis reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 1.8X (Beckman Coulter). Following, a single PCR amplification reaction containing 5 \u03bcL first-strand cDNA, 2X Q5 High Fidelity Mastermix (NEB), dNTP (10 mM each), forward universal primer (10 \u03bcM) and reverse primer mix (0.2 \u03bcM each in heavy-chain mix, 0.2 \u03bcM each in light-chain mix) were subjected to thermal cycling with the following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min 30 s followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 4 min. All primer sequences used in this protocol were previously described (Turchaninova et al., 2016). The first PCR reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 0.6X (Beckman Coulter). Amplicon libraries were then prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences Multiplex SMRT Sequencing protocol and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform. Raw sequencing data was demultiplexed and circular consensus sequences (CCS) were determined using the Pacific Biosciences SMRT Analysis tool suite.

Binding to un-transduced Jurkat (mock) or uncleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP served as controls. EC50 values for saturated binding of mAb to GPCL were determined using Prism 7.2 software (GraphPad) after log transformation of mAb concentration and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis. For non-saturating mAb binding, which observed with intact GP, EC50 values were calculated by linear regression analysis using EC50 and maximum response (Bmax) values that determined from saturating binding to GPCL as above.",

Comprehensive high-throughput alanine scanning (\u2018shotgun mutagenesis\u2019) was carried out on an expression construct for EBOV GP lacking the mucin-like domain (residues 311-461) (based on the Yambuku-Mayinga variant GP sequence), mutagenizing GP residues 33-310 and 462-676 to create a library of clones, each representing an individual point mutant. Residues were changed to alanine (with alanine residues changed to serine). The resulting library, covering 492 of 493 (99.9%) of target residues, was arrayed into 384-well plates, one mutant per well, then transfected into HEK293T cells and allowed to express for 22 h. Cells, unfixed or fixed in 4% PFA, were incubated with primary antibody and then with an AF488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing, cellular fluorescence was detected using the Intellicyt flow cytometer. mAb reactivity against each mutant EBOV GP clone was calculated relative to wild-type EBOV GP reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type GP-transfected controls. Mutated residues within clones were identified as critical to the mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test mAb but did support reactivity of other control EBOV mAbs. This counter-screen strategy facilitated the exclusion of GP mutants that were misfolded locally or that exhibited an expression defect (Davidson and Doranz, 2014).",

This procedure revealed several sub-states of the complex, with portions of the glycan cap in different positions in each protomer position. A single class with 13,144 particles was selected based off of estimated resolution and due to the appearance of C3 symmetry, indicating that all three of the glycan cap protomers were in the same position in this class.

These components were fit into the EM density using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and a single round of real-space refinement was performed in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) using NCS and secondary structure constraints. The resulting model was then refined in Rosetta (DiMaio et al., 2015). For each round of refinement, 319 models were produced and evaluated using MolProbity (Williams et al., 2018) and EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015). Idealized glycans were then added and trimmed to fit EM density using the model with the best statistics, followed by manual adjustment in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) followed by a final round of refinement in Rosetta, including glycans and restraining backbone coordinates. For the EBOV GP \u0394Muc\u0394TM (Makona) complex with rEBOV-548 alone, an additional refinement in Phenix was performed to idealize geometry. Glycans were validated using PDB-care (L\u00fctteke and von der Lieth, 2004) and Privateer (Agirre et al., 2015). All model figures were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). To estimate change in GP solvent exclusion upon Fabs binding, GP1,2 from an unliganded GP structure (PDB: 5JQ3), and GP1,2 bound to the respective Fabs were used to create a surface map in UCSF chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and then normalized to Gly-X-Gly tripeptides (Bendell et al., 2014) to determine a normalized solvent excluded surface (SES).",

The complex was screened for crystallization using a Douglas Instruments Oryx8, and the protein crystallized in a solution of 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0 and 1.4 M ammonium sulfate. Diffraction data to 3.46 \u0415 resolution were collected at beamline 23-IDD at the Advanced Photon Source. The diffraction images were processed using iMosflm (Battye et al., 2011) and scaled using Aimless (Evans and Murshudov, 2013). Molecular replacement, model building, and structure refinement were carried out using the PHENIX suite of programs (Adams et al., 2010). Chains G and H of the PDB entry 5HJ3 were used as molecular replacement search models for GPCL, and chains Y and Z of the PDB entry 4YK4 were used as a search model for EBOV-520 Fab following model pruning using Sculptor (Bunkyczi and Read, 2011). The molecular graphics application Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) was used for model inspection and manual refinement. A single GPCL monomer and a single EBOV-520 Fab were contained within the asymmetric unit of the P4132 crystals, and crystal symmetry was applied to generate the model of the biologically relevant trimer shown in all figures.",

EC50 values for mAb binding were determined after log transformation of antibody concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis. In neutralization assays, IC50 values were calculated after log transformation of antibody concentrations using a 3-parameter nonlinear fit analysis. The effect of antibody composition on the GP binding (single mAb or two-antibody mixture) and p values were estimated by overall test from untransformed MFI flow cytometric values using two-way ANOVA. In neutralization assays, mAb synergy by cocktails was quantified with CompuSyn software using approach that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination (Chou, 2010). CI values were calculated for each tested concentration of mAb combination, and CI values < 1 considered as evidence of synergy. Viral titers in plasma were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) where column medians compared to a value that equals to the limit of detection for the plaque assay (1.4 log10 PFU/mL). p < 0.05 considered as significant.
