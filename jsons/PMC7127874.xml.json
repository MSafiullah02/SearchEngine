Rapidly increasing are publications regarding the diagnosis of COVID\u201119 pneumonia by computed tomography (CT), but limited articles seemingly have reported infection control in the CT suites. We would like to thank Nakajima et al. for publishing a good and timely article focusing on this critical issue. We want to comment on the protection of CT suites from COVID\u201119 infection in our tertiary emergency hospital in Japan. Approximately 10\u201315 patients suspected of COVID\u201119 infection are being transferred to our hospital each day at the time of writing this manuscript (March 19th, 2020). Our hospital has two CT suites; one is used for scanning scheduled patients or performing interventional radiology under CT guidance, while the other is used for scanning emergency patients.",

This is because CT findings of COVID-19 are not seemingly specific and overlap with other infections [2]. Despite several limitations, viral tests, including reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are currently used as a diagnostic indicator worldwide [3]. Instead of CT, we consistently take a chest radiograph with portable radiography in the specific rooms. Our strategies are consistent with the current American College of Radiology (ACR) recommendations [3]. Additionally, our approach reduces the risk of COVID\u201119 infection in the CT suites.",

This is because we need to use the CT suites for the next patients as soon as possible. Nakajima et al. reported that CT examinations on the patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected were performed at the end of the daily CT schedule [1]. Therefore, we estimate that their interval time may be approximately less than 12\u201318 h from scanning the patients with COVID\u201119 infection confirmed or suspected to scanning the next patient. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that novel coronavirus was detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2\u20133 days on plastic and stainless steel [4]. Since unfortunately, our CT suites do not include a negative pressure ventilation system, we may need to take much longer intervals in our clinical practice. If we are to use CT for rapidly increasing patients with COVID\u201119 infection confirmed or suspected, we presume that CT operating times, as well as numbers of patients that can be scanned, will markedly reduce due to the extensive time spent on cleaning CT suites. In the worst-case scenario, healthcare using CT may collapse in our hospital.",
