Here we describe the design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10-week period. Methodology/principal findings: 590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012-January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as \"seed\" participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 \"nominees\" enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants were asked to respond to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Participants were randomized to either a 3-Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N = 103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P < 0.002). Conclusions/significance: We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Isolation, defined as separating sick individuals from healthy ones, is an integral public health measure for preventing transmission of infectious diseases (Ferguson et al., 2006; Aledort et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2006) . Contact mixing patterns have been shown to be important in the spread of airborne pathogens (Edmunds et al., 2006 (Edmunds et al., , 1997 Melegaro et al., 2011; Wallinga et al., 1999;  http Mossong et al., 2008; Eames et al., 2010; Van Kerckhove et al., 2013) . Few studies, however, have examined the effect of isolation on the spread of influenza to the social contacts of ill individuals (Aledort et al., 2007; Jefferson et al., 2011) . One reason for the lack of research examining the impact of these measures, in particular, on influenza transmission is the difficulty in assessing whether individuals who are in contact with an index case are, in fact, protected by that individual's isolation (Ball and Neal, in press; Germann et al., 2006) . Indeed, such a study requires enumeration of a social network prior to any cases arising within the network and longitudinal collection of detailed information about the timing, duration, intensity, and setting of contacts between index cases and any members of their social network, after an individual's illness onset (Edmunds et al., 2006; Melegaro et al., 2011; Mossong et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008) . Furthermore, to test whether these measures reduce transmission of infectious disease within a social network, index cases must be randomized to engage in isolation as soon as they become ill.

Our successful use of chain referral sampling during participant recruitment allowed us to elucidate links within a social network of individuals at baseline and then follow this dynamic social network over time during the 2013 influenza season. The chain referral method of enrollment was particularly important in our study design; by enrolling students via their social connections, we increased the likelihood of a more complete social network during the study period. Most studies that include social contact information are egocentric (i.e., they only measure the number of immediate contacts for each individual, rather than capturing the connections between individuals). However, using an explicitly social network-based enrollment approach allowed us to gather longer chains of contacts between individuals. This approach will help to reveal transmission along a chain of contacts, or effects due to intersections of multiple transmission chain; fully capturing these dynamic transmission processes as they travel along the social network requires combining a chain referral-type approach with social contact measurements over time. Our study also highlights the importance of the nomination process in subsequent participation, as students who were nominated by more enrolled participants were more likely to enroll in the study than those who received fewer nominations. This perhaps indicates that students are more likely to participate in this type of study if more of their friends are also participating. Additionally, this likely resulted in participation by more socially connected students, which is particularly important for studies of infection transmission over social networks. Further, demographic data of undergraduate students living on-campus provided by University Housing shows that our study population was representative of the university population. Our study design is well-suited for examining the impact of not only isolation on preventing influenza transmission, but also modeling the impact of other measures, such as quarantine, that rely on collecting data among healthy contacts and following them over time to examine occurrence of illness and interactions over the period of exposure to illness onset. In addition, we introduced the use of a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected Bluetooth data on social contacts as well as contextually-dependent, contact-triggered survey data that will allow us to gain insights into interactions between participants in our study that may not be captured using traditional social network survey methodology.

By conducting our study in university residence halls we were able to overcome several limitations facing studies of influenza transmission conducted in the household setting (Cowling et al., 2009; Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985; Viboud et al., 2004) . First, it is logistically difficult to require symptomatic individuals within households to isolate themselves in separate living quarters in order to protect healthy family members. Second, even if it were possible to bar interaction in the household setting, the protective effects of isolation would not be easy to measure given the high rate of secondary transmission that occurs in the household setting (Cowling et al., 2009; Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985; Viboud et al., 2004) . By contrast, a dorm setting allows more effective physical barring of interaction among the majority of social network members as well as classroom interactions (apart from shared bathroom facilities and possible roommate interactions during the intervention period). As an adjunct to our intervention, we provided and encouraged the donning of surgical masks when an intervention participant needed to visit the bathroom or leave their dorm room for any other reason. In addition, we provided guidelines on proper covering of coughs/sneezes and encouraged proper hand hygiene for the ILI cases and their roommates to reduce the potential for transmission when it was impossible to physically intervene on human interaction (i.e., sharing a dorm with roommates during the intervention). Third, we were able to explicitly gather extensive data on factors that are external to households but may also contribute to transmission, such as shared class schedules and participant interactions both within living quarters and within the wider university community. Overall, our study design and the physical environment of university residence halls allowed us to enumerate a much larger number of potential contacts and varying contexts where transmission may occur than one would generally observe in a household setting. That said, schools and particularly the residence hall setting are specialized environments and do not mirror the general population. However, our study setting does provide us with insights into larger networks that may be more representative of interactions that happen outside the household, in schools, and in other social settings (Ali et al., 2014; Newman and Girvan, 2004; Schafer, 2011; Zachary, 1977) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 364, "text": "(Aiello et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 365, "end": 387, "text": "(Aiello et al., , 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 565, "end": 587, "text": "(Cowling et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 588, "end": 613, "text": "Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 614, "end": 634, "text": "Viboud et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1068, "text": "(Cowling et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1094, "text": "Hitomi and Shimizu, 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1115, "text": "Viboud et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2771, "end": 2789, "text": "(Ali et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2814, "text": "Newman and Girvan, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2815, "end": 2829, "text": "Schafer, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2830, "end": 2844, "text": "Zachary, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although seeds and nominees in our study population had few differences in the demographic, health behavior, health status, and psychosocial characteristics, we identified a number of interesting features of our social network related to enrollment type.

In addition, nominees were slightly older than seeds.

Only 12 and 11 individuals in the intervention and control arms dropped out of the study during the intervention period, respectively.

Future studies should identify ways to encourage completion beyond initial enrollment, e.g., perhaps timing enrollment closer to the study period or providing frequent incentives based on completion of the weekly surveys. Among those who did participate during the intervention period, survey completion and active participation was high, with over eighty percent of participants completing over half of the weekly surveys. Additionally, the average number of contacts reported by individual participants per survey remained fairly consistent over the intervention period (mean: 3.6, SE: 0.06), thus we did not observe attrition in reporting of social interactions over the course of the study. As only one participant needed to report contact for the edge to be included in the Weekly social networks, we were able to capture contacts with students who were not actively participating, reducing the impact of missing data. However, close to half of all contacts reported on the weekly surveys were reciprocal (i.e., reported by both connected participants), allowing for additional verification of a given edge. Additionally, the increased participation requirements for ILI cases did not reduce engagement, as cases completed the same number of weekly surveys as non-cases. Similarly, intervention arm did not significantly affect participation among ILI cases, as demonstrated by the fact that 3-Day ILI cases had similar participation rates as control ILI cases.

Within the reduced network of enrolled participants who provided self-report information, participants also tended to associate with those who shared sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, parental education, and employment, as well as those with similar health habits (i.e., smoking, drinking behavior, and risk for complications due to an influenza infection), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that health behaviors cluster within social networks and that individuals tend to have friends with similar demographic profiles ( Barclay et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014) . The iEpi sub-study participants were less likely to engage in drinking than non-participants, which may reflect the sampling method employed for selection into the iEpi sub-study, whereby individuals from a strongly inter-connected community were given priority for invitations to participate in the sub-study as highly connected individuals are likely to share health behaviors that were positively assortative in the Nomination Network.

In terms of overall network structure, the average closeness and betweenness centralities for the largest component in the Nomination Network were both low, with small standard deviations, suggesting that most individuals were not strongly central to the network. The generally low betweenness centrality for most individuals implies that there were multiple shortest paths between most individuals, forming a more evenly dense network as opposed to a network wherein a small number of individuals act as \"bridges\" between more densely-connected clusters or clumps within the fully connected network. As such, it may difficult or impossible to identify individuals who are particularly influential in transmission across the network. The degree distribution for the overall Nomination Network and Combined Weekly Network were scale-free with a roughly power-law degree distribution (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3) , consistent with a wide range of previous social network studies (e.g., (Barab\u00e1si, 2009; Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999; Newman, 2001) ). Scale-free degree distributions have been shown to facilitate rapid dispersal of information (or in this case, infection), across the network and to have connectivity that is robust to random node removals (Barab\u00e1si, 2009; Lusseau, 2003) . We also observed positive clustering coefficients in both the Nomination and Week Networks, which is an additional measure of the degree of network clustering. Transitivities were higher in the Combined Week Network than in the Nomination Network. Clustered network structures such as these have been shown to facilitate rapid dispersal across the network in the first wave of an infection, although they may inhibit subsequent waves of infection (Kiss et al., 2006) . As the majority of the Nomination Network was subsequently captured in the Combined Weekly Network, it appears that the students maintained their relationships from early in the school year as well as added new relationships.

In addition, participants were made aware of all study protocols to which they could be randomized prior to consent, which we anticipated would increase the likelihood that individuals who enrolled were willing to participate in either the 3-Day isolation intervention or control group. We also provided a wide range of services for those in the intervention group to facilitate compliance with isolation, including delivering snacks during their isolation period, such as doctors' notes to instructors or employers to excuse participants from classes or work, and assistance with obtaining class notes or proctoring of exams falling during intervention group participants' isolation period. In addition, each participant received a kit that included facemasks to be worn if they needed to leave their room during their isolation period, a thermometer for verifying fever, and hand sanitizer.

The size of the study, as well as the setting, required extensive organizational efforts. For example, a large study staff had to be trained in recruitment, participant assistance (e.g., illness response, food delivery during isolation, and follow-up communication), online survey development, database creation and management, specimen collection, data cleaning and analysis. The complexity and amount of the collected data required a large amount of server space, as well as a programming specialist to create a system that could automatically make live updates, email and schedule specimen collection, identify and email contacts of ILI cases, and link data across the various surveys. Additionally, the iEpi sub-study required extensive mapping of on-campus routers, occasional debugging, data cleaning and verification. The study population and setting also added to the logistical challenges of the study. Study staff needed access to the residence halls for recruitment and specimen collection, which required cooperation with multiple university offices (Housing and Security). Data cleaning was extensive, particularly coding any open ended survey responses, filling in class schedule responses, and deciphering the large amount of iEpi data to ensure the smartphones were collecting data accurately and consistently (e.g., using the correct timestamps and locations). The overall success of the recruitment, survey, and intervention methods leads us to conclude that if we were to later run a similar study, we would be able to use this study protocol without making substantive changes. To the best of our knowledge, the information in this study represents the most comprehensive longitudinal data collected in a social network study of respiratory infection transmission to date. Participant feedback on the eX-FLU study was also largely positive. The monetary incentive provided was successful in motivating participants to join the study, with 95.2% of those who completed the exit survey (N = 295) reporting the cash incentive as a reason for joining the study. In addition, 96.5% (N = 278) of participants who responded to the exit survey reported they would be willing to participate in a similar study in the future. These findings suggest that the methodology used is practical for future studies and the monetary incentive was sufficient to promote participant enrollment. Moreover, given the wide array of self-reported and objective data collected in this study, we will be able to address numerous questions related to social network interactions, behaviors, and infection transmission in future work. For example, analyses of the data derived from this study may provide insights on how health behaviors such as hand hygiene are transmitted along social networks and how these behaviors may be modified by illness status. These data may also allow us to conduct analyses to assess what role an individual's position in the social network may play in their health behaviors. In addition, data on different types of viral and bacterial pathogens, viral shedding, bacterial colonization, and transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens to healthy contacts will help elucidate the occurrence, transmission, and coinfection of specific types of viruses and bacteria over time, and to generate transmission trees (Ypma et al., 2012) . Furthermore, our assessment of bacterial colonization using specimens collected from healthy contacts in our study will allow us to fill gaps in the literature regarding colonization in young adults who reside in community settings, as most previous studies have focused on very young populations (Rodrigues et al., 2013; S\u00e1-Le\u00e3o et al., 2008) , elderly populations (Videcnik Zorman et al., 2013) , or individuals in health care centers (Peleg and Hooper, 2010) . Moreover, while this study had a specific focus on the effects of isolation, the underlying network data can be used to develop simulation models of social network dynamics among college students, to address a range of other questions. For example, one might examine via simulation the effects of quarantine (the restriction of movement of individuals whom have been exposed to an infectious illness without signs of illness) rather than isolation. In general, there is a need for more work on examining the effects of behavior (for both susceptible and infected individuals) in mathematical epidemiology (Funk et al., 2010 (Funk et al., , 2015 Phua and Lee, 2005; Hayashi and Eisenberg, 2016) This study will provide a new resource for these efforts building on egocentric data on social mixing patterns that have been used in previous work (Mossong et al., 2008; Potter et al., 2011; Hens et al., 2009; Fu, 2005; Mikolajczyk and Kretzschmar, 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3379, "end": 3398, "text": "(Ypma et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3698, "end": 3722, "text": "(Rodrigues et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3723, "end": 3744, "text": "S\u00e1-Le\u00e3o et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3767, "end": 3797, "text": "(Videcnik Zorman et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3838, "end": 3862, "text": "(Peleg and Hooper, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 4470, "end": 4488, "text": "(Funk et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4489, "end": 4509, "text": "(Funk et al., , 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4510, "end": 4529, "text": "Phua and Lee, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 4530, "end": 4558, "text": "Hayashi and Eisenberg, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4707, "end": 4729, "text": "(Mossong et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 4730, "end": 4750, "text": "Potter et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4751, "end": 4769, "text": "Hens et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4770, "end": 4779, "text": "Fu, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 4780, "end": 4814, "text": "Mikolajczyk and Kretzschmar, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, this is the first study design to overlay a randomized isolation intervention onto a social network populated via chain referral sampling and to prospectively collect data on social interactions, ILI, and isolation behavior in a population at risk for influenza in the case of a pandemic.

Further analyses will provide key insights regarding the impact of isolation on the prevention of influenza transmission as well as many other respiratory viruses that share similar transmission pathways.
