It is commonly held that the collection of vector specimens applies only to arbovirus surveillance and that the surveillance of non-arboviruses must rely on traditional methods that involve the sampling of blood, faeces or saliva, or other examinations. The vector-based approach is a sampling method that has the ability to survey both arboviruses and non-arboviruses by distinguishing engorged vector specimens from entire vector samples. Accordingly, five arboviruses and three non-arboviruses were detected in a study using a vector-based approach conducted during 2012-2015. Hence, this report provides the first description of the Taiwanese vector species for the bovine arboviruses detected. The present investigations demonstrate that the vector-based approach applies not only to the surveillance of arboviruses, but also has potential as a possible tool for monitoring non-arboviruses on livestock farms in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infectious viral diseases pose continual and substantial threats to the dairy industry and have serious implications for animal welfare, food security and even human health.

A comprehensive investigation conducted in dairy farms in Taiwan found 17 species of Culicoides biting midge (Chien, 2015) . However, the present study identified only five species, although this may reflect the short duration of the period of collection of live specimens for virus detections. Culicoides oxystoma is a dominant species on dairy farms, and is also associated with paddy rice fields (Yanase et al., 2013) . This species is identified as a vector of BEFV, AKAV, AINOV, PEAV and CHUV in Taiwan and Japan (Yanase et al., 2005) . The present findings revealed an ornithophilic species, C. arakawae, which may also be a potential vector of BEFV, and its occurrence may be related to the dynamic of wild birds or to distance from a poultry farm (Yanase et al., 2005) . Although target bovine arboviruses are considered to be mainly Culicoides-borne viruses, mosquitoes may also play an important role in bovine arbovirus transmission. Culex tritaeniorhynchus may be a potential vector of BEFV, AINOV and CHUV. In a previous study, AKAV was isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Japan (Yamakawa et al., 2006) , but was not in the present study; however, AKAV was detected in Cx. quinquefasciatus in Taiwan. Thus, the susceptibility of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus to Taiwanese AKAV strains requires further examination. Culex quinquefasciatus may be a potential vector of AINOV, whereas Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Culex pipiens molestus and Culex fuscocephala are possible vectors of CHUV in Taiwan. The present authors recorded the first finding of Ar. subalbatus as a potential vector of AINOV and CHUV and propose that An. sinensis is a potential vector of BEFV and AKAV. The habitats of these mosquito vectors are associated with rice paddy fields, human residues and cattle dung (Ohba et al., 2013) . Dairy farms in Taiwan are commonly located near other livestock farms or close to rice paddies, which provides these vector species with various ideal habitats. The present MIR data indicate higher estimations in mosquitoes than in Culicoides biting midges (Table 4 ). There are no previous reports of MIRs of the five detected arboviruses, but the MIRs of Schmallenberg virus (Orthobunyavirus) and bluetongue virus (Orbivirus) were found to fall in the interval between 0.1 and 100 (Braks et al., 2017) . However, MIRs are vulnerable to interference by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as the extrinsic incubation period in a vector, sampling population size, and the sensitivity of the detection method (Bustamante & Lord, 2010) . Thus, the present group proposes to examine the vector competence of the potential vector species identified for detected arboviruses because most of these can be bred in the laboratory.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 327, "text": "(Chien, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 604, "end": 625, "text": "(Yanase et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 723, "end": 744, "text": "(Yanase et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 960, "end": 981, "text": "(Yanase et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1323, "text": "(Yamakawa et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2032, "text": "(Ohba et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2538, "text": "(Braks et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2745, "end": 2770, "text": "(Bustamante & Lord, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2292, "end": 2300, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A nationwide programme of surveillance of AKAV, CHUV and IBAV showed their seroprevalences to be 83.95%, 67.78% and 80.77%, respectively (Ting et al., 2004) , which suggests that these arboviruses might have become endemic after the first isolation in the 1990s.

In the present study, the first detections of AINOV were in YL-A in October 2012, but the main detections were recorded from the end of 2013 to the middle of 2014 in five sampling farms. However, PEAV was detected only in YL-A in November 2012 , and this temporal and geographic profile of PEAV requires further study. Some reassortment between AINOV and PEAV may occur in nature (Yanase et al., 2010) , although this phenomenon has not yet been observed by cloning their structure genes (data not shown). In 2012-2013, BEFV broke out in both the Yaeyama Islands, Japan, and Taiwan; BEFV may have been transferred from the Yaeyama Islands to eastern Taiwan through an airstream (Ting et al., 2014; Hayama et al., 2016) . The initial outbreak of BEFV occurred in September 2012 in eastern Taiwan, but the virus soon spread to western Taiwan via Pingtung County; this temporospatial pattern of occurrence is in line with predictions made by airstream simulation (Hayama et al., 2016) . Another viewpoint indicated that BEFV may spread in a seasonal direction from southern China to southwestern Taiwan (Walker & Klement, 2015) . Therefore, phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of vectors and pathogens are essential for understanding temporospatial patterns of occurrence of bovine arboviral diseases in terms of the influences of geographic distributions and seasonal atmospheric conditions in countries of eastern and southeastern Asia. Bovine leukaemia virus is a blood-borne pathogen that is responsible for longterm viraemia in cattle and has been diagnosed earlier in Taiwan (Wang, 1991; Barez et al., 2015) . Both characteristics are useful for elucidating the feasibility of vector-based approaches in dairy farms. The present results showed a positive rate of 18.75%, but the conversion of data between regular serum investigations and vector-based approaches requires further study. The vector-based approach may also be applicable for the surveillance of other pathogens in cattle blood, such as Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and Trypanosoma spp. The detection of BVDV and RVA demonstrated that a vector-based approach can also be applied to transient viraemia viruses.

The vector-based approach provides rapid results by RT-PCR detections within 24 h and allows for a high frequency of sampling. It also reduces the pain and possible distress associated with blood sampling in cattle. Furthermore, users of this approach do not need professional expertise to identify vector species if the targets of analysis are non-arboviruses, and the pooling of different vector species will not affect the detection of non-arboviruses. However, the current vector-based approach requires further improvement if it is to be applied in the field because the efficiency of this approach must be comparable with that of other sampling methods, such as blood or milk sampling, and other details of this approach, such as the parameters of trap setting, limitation of collection time and the effects of blood digested in the midguts of vectors, also require further investigation. Therefore, the present authors suggest that the vector-based approach has the potential to be used as a surveillance tool to increase understanding of epidemics of both arboviruses and non-arboviruses on livestock farms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.
