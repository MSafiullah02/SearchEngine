From this, the needs for assistance and support in the ICUs of all the countries of the world has increased. Likewise, each time the cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia continue to grow, which has forced the assistance of mechanical ventilation in these cases 7,8,9 . A report by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center (ICNARC) 10 in the United The percentage of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who require advanced ventilatory support, such as mechanical ventilation (MV), is high. However, there are currently no specific protocols for the management of MV in these patients. On the other hand, the need for updating based on scientific evidence on the assistance and management of mechanical ventilation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 has increased. Thus, this study aims to describe the ventilatory support strategies in SARS-CoV-2 during intensive therapy.",

La ventilaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica es el principal tratamiento de apoyo respiratorio para pacientes cr\u00edticos, que debe administrarse tan pronto como no se pueda mantener la oxigenaci\u00f3n normal y a pesar de que no existe un consenso actual sobre los par\u00e1metros de ventilaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica, la evidencia recolectada sugiere el uso de Fio2 en promedio del 50%, PEEP de 14 cmH2O, compliance pulmonar de 29-37 ml por cm de agua, driving pressure entre 12-14 cm de agua y una presi\u00f3n plateaude 22-25 cm de agua. Conclusiones: La IL-6 se muestra como un posible marcador de falla respiratoria y peor pronostico al igual, que la obesidad.

INTRODUCCI\u00d3N SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus infection disease recently discovered in humans, which comes from the Coronavirus family and is affecting the world population, becoming a matter of public calamity. The outbreak of Coronavirus disease was first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019, and has now become a pandemic, affecting the world population. According to the last report of the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 for March 30, 2020. 215 territories had reported confirmed cases of COVID-19), 1\u00b4655.378 in the Region of the Americas (98.723 deaths), 1`707.946 in the European Region (155.552 deaths), 255.728 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (8.878 deaths), 159.662 cases in the Eastern Pacific Region (6.470 deaths), 95.314 in the Southeast Asia Region (3.356 deaths), 42.626 in the African Region (1.369 deaths). According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, as of May 10, 2020, there were almost 4 million (3'986.119) cases of COVID-19 and 278.814 deaths worldwide. Some of the countries with the highest number of deaths for the same date were: United States (78.794), United Kingdom (31.587), Italy (30.395), Spain (26.478), France (26.310), Brazil (10.627), among others. Likewise, an ECDPC analysis with 17 countries in Europe determined that the most commonly reported clinical symptoms were fever (47%), dry or productive cough (25%), sore throat (16%), general weakness (6%) and pain (5%); hospitalization occurred in 30% (13.122 of 43.438) of the cases reported in 17 countries, and the cases requiring ICU or respiratory support represented 2.179 of 49.282 (4%) 2 .",
