Coronaviruses are medium-sized, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses whose name derives from their characteristic crown-like appearance in electron micrographs.(1,3) While until recently, six human coronaviruses had been identified, in December 2019, a seventh human coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, also a beta-coronavirus, was identified initially in Wuhan, China, and it has subsequently become pandemic.(2,4) As with the SARS epidemic, the initial outbreak of the new coronavirus occurred during the Spring Festival in China, the most famous of all festivals in China, during which more than 3 million people travel countrywide, creating favourable conditions for spread of the highly contagious virus.(5,6) All coronavirus infections are zoonotic, and following mutation, recombination and adaptation are passed on to humans.(6,7)",

The beginning of the outbreak was identified as being through an association with a seafood market that sold live animals, which most of the initial patients had either worked at or had visited.(4) As the outbreak spread, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Person-to-person spread is mainly through respiratory droplets, much like that of influenza.(4) With droplet transmission, the virus is released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, and this then causes infection if it comes into direct contact with mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth. While droplets typically do not travel more than 2 m, experimental studies have suggested that the virus can remain viable in aerosols for up to 3 h at least.",

In hospitalized HIV-infected patients on ART and not severely immunocompromised, the disease severity and clinical outcomes were similar to that of HIV-uninfected persons.(28) However, another literature review indicated that while it was assumed that HIV infection would be a risk factor for more severe disease and death with H1N1 influenza infection, most cases, as with other immunocompromised individuals, recovered without major consequences.(29)",

            "text": "There are very few published studies that have investigated directly the interaction between these novel coronaviruses and HIV infection, and therefore no conclusions can be reached regarding the impact of this coinfection. There is a single case report describing a patient with HIV infection who survived MERS-CoV pneumonia,(30) and another single case report of a patient with HIV who survived coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.(31) Although not yet published in the scientific literature, Dr Joseph Llibre, an HIV physician and clinical researcher from Spain recently, posted a commentary on the Clinical Care Options website regarding their experiences with the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with HIV infection.(32) Quite unexpectedly, but very interestingly, their experience has been that PLWHIV do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, or of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in association with the infection, irrespective of their viral load or CD4 cell count. In fact, the risk appears to be even lower than in the general population. It does not appear to be related to the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected patients, such as use of the protease inhibitors. The absence of an increased risk of COVID-19 in PLWHIV was thought to be surprising because dysregulation of the immune response especially that which involves the T-lymphocyte system seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections, and the occurrence of lymphopenia is a recognized risk factor for the occurrence of ARDS and death among infected patients. Importantly, currently available data on host entry mechanisms and intracellular pathways harnessed by the HIV virus and the novel coronavirus do not show cooperative pathogenesis. While this may seem to be reassuring for PLWHIV, appropriate additional studies need to be conducted to address these issues and confirm these findings, before such reassurance can be given.",

The study of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, in addition to standard of care, versus standard of care alone did not show a significant difference in the primary objective of time to clinical improvement.(36) A further study was undertaken, in which the RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was modelled, validated and then targeted using anti-polymerase drugs currently registered for use against various viruses (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir and Tenofovir).(37) RdRp is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses. In that study, these antiviral agents were shown to be able to bind tightly to RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus could possibly be useful for the treatment of this infection.",
