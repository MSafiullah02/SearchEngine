            "text": "Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Use of tracheostomy can facilitate weaning from ventilation and potent ially increase the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. When the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Italy and Spain, ICUs had a massive influx of patients who were critically ill, many of whom became candidates for tracheostomy. However, tracheostomy is an aerosolgenerating procedure, so health-care workers are at risk of infection during insertion and subsequent care, even when appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is used. Aerosol-generating procedures were identified as a leading cause of viral transmission during the SARS outbreak in 2003, with super-spreading events occurring throughout hospitals in Hong Kong, China, and Canada. 2 Reports of infections related to aerosol-generating procedures have also emerged in the current pandemic. 3 Although global community-based strategies to manage the impact of COVID-19 are a priority for the general population, tracheostomy is one of a number of important clinical considerations for the optimal management of patients who are critically ill during the pandemic. 4 We aim to provide authoritative guidance for health-care providers and health-care systems, highlighting the range of considerations for tracheostomy during the current COVID-19 pandemic, by synthesising experience, currently available evidence, and lessons from history. Owing to the urgent need for guidance and the lack of robust ICU outcome data, we make pragmatic recommendations and suggestions primarily on the basis of international, multidisciplinary expert opinion.",

Some of these methods would only be required in worst-case scenarios, such as that seen during the influenza pandemic of 1918-19, because they are socially and economically disruptive. The hypothesis behind community mitigation has now become popularly known as \"flattening the curve\". 5 By delaying the peak of the epidemic, less strain is put on health-care capacity, and the burden on hospitals and infrastructure is reduced. In turn, the overall case numbers and health impacts might be reduced, allowing more time for the development of better medical therapies and preventive vaccines. An evaluation of these strategies in the context of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic indicated that cities that acted early had much lower morbidity and mortality than those that did not. 6 As we apply these community mitigation strategies on a global level that has never been seen before in human history, future evaluation will determine their effect on Health-care Development the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracheostomy was an essential clinical strategy for managing epidemics associated with respiratory failure during the 20th century, including those of poliomyelitis and diptheria, 4 and we hope that the careful conduct and management of tracheostomy during the current pandemic will help to reduce the impact of COVID-19.",

The first round consisted of a core writing group (BAM, MJB, SJW, VP, AA, NT, and DJF-K) that drafted distinct statements as part of the paper, making recommendations on case selection, timing, performance of tracheostomy, and management after tracheostomy, on the basis of the primary data sources retrieved. These recommendations were circulated among all consensus working group members, inviting both opinion and any additional recommendations. The second round involved circulating all new recommendations received, along with those recommendations from the first round that had received favourable comment from the majority (over half) of the respondents (appendix pp 2-3). A final review of the recommendations was made during a videoconference, which included 29 of the group members, followed by electronic correspondence and telephone discussions, facilitating iterative review and refinement over three rounds to achieve consensus agreement for the content of this paper.",

            "text": "First we considered the role of tracheostomy in critical illness and respiratory failure. Approximately 8-13% of patients admitted to modern ICUs who require mechanical ventilation have a tracheostomy. 7 The major indication for tracheostomy remains the facilitation of mechanical ventilation for a long period, while minimising complications from a translaryngeal endotracheal tube and weaning from ventilation. Tracheostomy might also be required for actual or threatened airway obstruction, laryngeal oedema (which might be an emerging feature of COVID-19) 8 or unsuccessful extubation due to weakness, poor cough, tenacious secretions, or a combination of these factors. Decision making around access to critical care and tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic is based mainly on existing standards of practice, although the evidence base for tracheostomy timing in those who are critically ill is not substantial. 9 Tracheostomy in the context of critical illness is not always in the patient's best interests. Among patients without COVID-19 who require tracheostomy after an extended period of mechanical ventilation, at least half do not survive for more than 1 year, and at 1 year fewer than 12% are at home and functionally independent. 10 Similarly, tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19 might not always be beneficial, and the procedure and sub sequent care puts health-care workers at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and surrogates need information and discussion in the context of a multidisciplinary team about trade-offs, challenges, and the outcomes of tracheostomy; that tracheostomy in this context will often be followed by long periods of functional dependency and rehabilitation should be explained. These decisions might become more important in an overwhelmed health-care system with few resources to care for patients who are critically ill, recovering, or highly dependent. Although rationing in health care is not unprecedented, in the modern age we have never before been faced with the prospect of having to ration medical goods and services on such a large scale. Decision makers might have to consider the appropriateness of embarking on a tracheostomy, with the associated health-care resources, in the context of shortages of staff, equipment, medications, and facilities. An independent triage or ethics committee could help to guide decisions, communicate with patients and their relatives, and reduce the burden on frontline staff. 11",

After symptom onset, viral load typically decreases over the following 3-4 days. 15 In most patients, samples from the lower respiratory tract remained PCRpositive for SARS-CoV-2 after samples from the upper respiratory tract had become negative, for up to 39 days. 16 In patients with severe disease, the viral RNA load is significantly higher and decreases more slowly than in those with mild disease. 17, 18 The immune response (antiviral antibody) typically appears both in the respiratory secretions and in the blood around 7 days after symptom onset, and is detectable in 90% of patients by 12 days after symptom onset. 17 The presence of antibody inhibits the infectivity of detectable virus. The presence of viral RNA detected by PCR (so-called viral shedding), does not necessarily indicate infectivity, especially in the presence of antiviral antibodies. True infectivity can only be assessed by viral culture in cells in vitro, or be inferred from clinical or epidemiological data.",

We suggest that decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic reflect the range of applicable considerations (figure 2; appendix pp 2-7). Patient selection for attempted primary extubation should be based on established practice-ie, in those with improving cardiovascular and respiratory physiological parameters, reducing markers of infect ion and inflammation, and a successful spon taneous breathing trial. 28 However, premature extubation exposes patients and staff to the risks associated with urgent rescue oxygenation strategies and re-intubation. We recommend a conservative approach to attempted extubation, limited to those predicted to have a high chance of success. ",

When elective tracheostomy is done, an inflated tracheostomy tube cuff via which pressure support ventilation can be delivered affords a closed system for controlled weaning of respiratory support. Although tracheostomy is associated with risks of infectious transmission, a primary extubation strategy in patients for whom the likelihood of success is low also carries risk. Several members of the consensus working group have personally been involved with or are aware of challenging re-intubations in patients with COVID-19, which suggests a role for mitigating risks of urgent or emergency re-intubation in difficult circumstances. Data are needed to understand attendant risks of infectious exposure to staff and other patients. Therapies for unsuccessful extubation, such as high-flow oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure, or non-invasive ventilation, generate hazardous aerosols to varying degrees and might not be appropriate; they also impose a strain on the capacity of hospital wards to deliver oxygen. 29 Recovering patients who continue to require ventilatory support via a tracheostomy can be managed with minimal sedation, which might simplify care and facilitate transfer to lower-acuity facilities, thus creating capacity for more acute patients.",

Patients with tracheostomy can be managed in the prone position, but the airway cannot be visualised, risking displacement and pressure damage. Clear decision making is important in patients who are recovering, with the options including primary extubation with or without a plan for re-intubation, a tracheostomy or, in some cases, palliation. Ensuring adequate PPE, to maintain the safety of the health-care team, is among the foremost considerations in decisions around the management of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. Notably, COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome can be characterised by vascular insult and disrupted vasoregulation, which can affect the critical care strategy, and the need for tracheostomy might be reduced with high-quality ICU care that considers the characteristic pathophysiology. 30 Based on case series and expert opinion, we suggest that tracheostomy be delayed until at least day 10 of mechanical ventilation and considered only when patients are showing signs of clinical improvement.",

Percutaneous, surgical, or hybrid approaches can be used in either location. Because tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure, 2 we recommend a hierarchical approach to choosing the operative location to balance patient and staff risks (appendix p 1), 32 recognising that many health-care facilities lack negative-pressure rooms. 1 Portable highefficiency particulate air filtration systems might be an acceptable alternative.

If a PAPR is not available, we advise the use of a fit-tested filtering face piece 3 (FFP3) or N95 mask with an additional fluid shield. The number of personnel present should be kept to an absolute minimum, with the most experienced operator and anaesthetist present. The team should prepare, rehearse, simulate, and communicate effectively. The tracheostomy technique is determined by local expertise and resources. We suggest that operators continue to do tracheostomies using the techniques and equipment with which they are familiar, and confident and experienced in using. Strategies to minimise aerosol generation are well documented. 1 Percutaneous tracheostomy usually involves opening the ventilator circuit more frequently than does surgical tracheostomy, and although ultrasound and bronchoscopy guidance might improve safety, the likelihood of aerosol generation is increased with percutaneous tracheostomy compared with surgical approaches. Surgical tracheostomies were generally favoured over per cutaneous tracheostomies during the SARS out break; 33,34 however, percutaneous techniques have sub sequently advanced and no data are available to establish superiority of one approach over the other from the standpoint of infectious transmission or safety.

Increases in the number of patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill can swiftly overwhelm hospitals, particularly because many require extended periods of ventilator support, and many will require tracheostomy to facilitate recovery. Globally, studies of the COVID-19 pandemic have a recurring theme: foresight and planning save lives, whereas inadequate preparedness is associated with overwhelmed health systems. Because tracheostomy is at the intersection of health-care worker safety, resource allocation, and patient-centred care, sound guidance is crucial. Many questions remain unanswered, and prospective data are needed to answer pressing questions around tracheostomy in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on infectivity and persistence of viral RNA in patients who are critically ill are sparse, particularly at timepoints beyond 20 days after symptom onset, when tracheostomy is typically considered. The predictive value of peak viral load and antibody response for gauging infectivity and transmission risks associated with different strategies for tracheostomy insertion require further study. The experiences of European countries show that preparedness is a powerful determinant of patient outcomes. Delayed intubation and lack of ventilator availability contribute to poor outcomes. Robust data collection, analysis, and benchmarking are essential, such as the approach taken by the Global Tracheostomy Collaborative. 39 If unconventional approaches to care (eg, shared ventilators or early tracheostomy) are used in a crisis, a moral imperative exists to study these interventions to assess their safety and efficacy.",

Sources identified included statements and guidance retrieved from websites of hospitals or recognised national societies identified by the search strategy, or known by the authors, many of whom were either involved in or aware of the development of national, local, or specialty-specific guidance. When several overlapping data sources were retrieved, we prioritised selection of sources representing national groups, or the larger case series. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the topics covered in this Health-care Development paper, with the aim of providing a contemporaneous review of emerging data on COVID-19 with direct relevance to the planning, conduct, and subsequent management of tracheostomy during the pandemic.",
