Although MRSA has historically been associated with healthcare and has become known as hospital-associated MRSA, it increasingly emerges without relationship to healthcare, in patients without apparent risk factors, as a distinct epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical entity known as community-associated MRSA.9, 10 The prevalence of community-associated MRSA, as revealed by a recent study conducted on 2636 patients with skin and skin structure S. aureus infections, increased from 9% in 2004 to 16% in 2005 and 21% in 2006.11 At the same time, growing epidemiological and genetic evidence points towards MRSA transmission across species, and unveils a previously unknown face that this microorganism is assuming, as an emerging zoonotic pathogen. The surge in community-associated MRSA, at a time when reports of animal-to-human transmission are increasing, might not be merely coincidental,12, 13 and according to a recent study conducted in the Netherlands, MRSA that entered from an animal reservoir into the human population is now responsible for over 20% of the strains isolated.14\n",

A similar study conducted among pig farmers in North America found colonization rates of 20%,22 supporting the possibility that pigs represent reservoirs for human MRSA infections irrespective of the geographic area. Moreover, it is important to note that MRSA strains of animal origin have been isolated from people lacking previous documented direct animal contacts, supporting the possibility that direct human-to-human transmission occurs subsequent to one person's colonization/infection. After a female patient was diagnosed with MRSA mastitis,18 her farmer husband, their baby girl, and three co-workers from the same farm were found to be colonized, as were eight out of 10 randomly chosen pigs. The strain isolated from the baby was genetically identical to the one isolated from her parents,18 despite her lack of direct contact with farm animals. In another example, MRSA was found in the screening cultures of a 6-month-old girl before thoracic surgery, and subsequently her parents were found to be colonized as well, presumably from a pig that the family raised on the farm.19\n",

Recent hospitalizations, outpatient visits, nursing home admissions, antibiotic exposure, chronic illness, and injection drug use are some of the most important MRSA risk factors.34, 35 However, maintaining a high index of suspicion in animal farmers and their families, pet owners, and professionals involved in animal care is essential, particularly when no apparent risk factors can be identified or when infections recur despite initial successful treatment. Moreover, besides the medical aspect, it is important to reflect on the broader public health perspective. Zoonotic colonization of these high-risk groups can provide the initial MRSA port of entry into the human population, facilitating subsequent direct human-to-human transmission\u2014an alarming scenario, especially if we recall the H5N1 influenza virus, for which human-to-human transmission was proposed to represent the last barrier needed to unleash a pandemic.36\n",
