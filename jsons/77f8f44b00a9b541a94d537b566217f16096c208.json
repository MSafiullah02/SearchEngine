Q2 X X Previous studies using repeat chest CT scans have shown that different stages could be presumed for changes in CT scan findings (2) . In the early course of COVID-19 pneumonia, pulmonary CT scans could either be normal or show subtle findings. The initial CT findings in patients include bilateral, multilobar ground glass opacificationD 1 8 X X with a peripheral or posterior distribution, most commonly in the lower lobes and less frequently in the middle lobe. These changes mainly occur during the early stage of disease, which is 0\u00c0D 1 9 X X4 days after the onset of initial symptoms (3). In the progressive stage (days 5\u00c0D 2 0 X X8), crazy-paving pattern, extension of ground glass opacificationD 2 1 X X, and the initial development of consolidation are the main radiologic features on CT. In the peak stage (days 9\u00c0D 2 2 X X13), dense consolidations become more prevalent and the air bronchogram sign is seen more commonly. Finally, in the absorption stage (14 days or more after the onset of initial symptoms) after the patients have recovered and the infection is controlled, consolidations gradually absorb. No crazy paving is evident at this stage, while fibrotic streaks, tractional bronchiectasis, bronchus distortion, and subD 2 3 X Xpleural fibrotic lines become more prominent (2) .",

The results were then aggregated, resulting in recommendations intended to provide guidance for medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in COVID-19 management (4) .They clearly stated the indications of using chest imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, as far as we are concerned, there is currently no general consensus regarding the role of repeat chest imaging (CT scan) in patients suspected, diagnosed or treated as COVID-19.",
