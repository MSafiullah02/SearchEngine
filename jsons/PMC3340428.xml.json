The rationale and methods for the TCRI cohort have been reported previously.23 The TCRI is a prospective cohort of 673 term (\u226537 weeks), non\u2013low-birth-weight (\u22652250 g) infants and their mothers designed to investigate the association of characteristics of infant viral ARIs, such as severity and cause, and familial atopic predisposition on the development of early childhood asthma and atopy.23 This investigation included the 383 mother-infant dyads in which the infant presented for an unscheduled clinic or emergency department visit or hospitalization and was determined to have a sole HRV- or RSV-induced ARI. Mother-infant dyads were enrolled at the time of an infant ARI during 4 viral respiratory seasons, September through May 2004-2008.23 Dyads were recruited in the inpatient, emergency department, and clinic settings at a single academic institution, and the children are currently being followed longitudinally through age 6 years to ascertain asthma and atopy outcomes. Each woman provided written informed consent for participation of herself and her infant. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved the study.",

Preferentially, women underwent skin prick tests to saline, histamine, and 8 aeroallergens: cat pelt, Alternaria species, grass mix #7, ragweed mix, oak mix, Tricophyton species, mite mix, and cockroach mix (Quintest Extract Tray; Hollister-Stier, Spokane, Wash).23 Allergen-specific IgE measurement (Phadiatop; Phadia, Kalamazoo, Mich) was performed on maternal blood samples for women who could not undergo skin prick tests or who had an inadequate skin test. Multiallergen screens for specific IgE (Phadiatop) were measured with the ImmunoCAP250 (performed by the Johns Hopkins DACI laboratory).26 A positive Phadiatop result was defined as 0.35 kUA/L or greater by using the standards in place at the time the assays were performed.27, 28 Among women for whom allergen sensitization status was determined based on skin prick test results or allergen-specific IgE levels, we classified women by whether they reported a history of asthma into 3 mutually exclusive categories: atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and no asthma. Women with self-reported asthma and evidence of allergen sensitization (\u22651 positive skin prick test response or positive Phadiatop result) were classified as having atopic asthma, women with self-reported asthma and without evidence of allergen sensitization were classified as having nonatopic asthma, and women who did not report self-reported asthma were in the no asthma group.",

Univariate analyses were conducted to compare maternal asthma factors by the infant\u2019s HRV- or RSV-induced ARI status by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables or the Pearson \u03c72 test for categorical variables. In our analyses we first defined maternal asthma using self-reported asthma in the women. In addition, to examine the association of maternal asthma in combination with an objective measure of atopy, we repeated all analyses using a more detailed definition that classified women as having atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, or no asthma by incorporating their skin prick test or allergen-specific IgE findings. Therefore we investigated whether (1) having a mother with self-reported asthma and (2) having a mother with atopic or nonatopic asthma was associated with an infant\u2019s ARI with HRV or RSV. We assessed the association of measures of maternal asthma and virus type in the overall ARI group (combined URTI and LRTI) and next among the LRTI subgroup. We applied a logistic regression model with variable HRV(+) or RSV(+) as a binary outcome variable and maternal asthma as defined above, as our main factor along with covariates. Because of our limited regression power determined by the HRV(+) group, we used propensity score adjustment to prevent overfitting because the propensity score analysis adjusts for many confounding factors simultaneously while preserving analytical power.31 Variables in the propensity score model included a priori selected variables: maternal race/ethnicity, SHS exposure, infant\u2019s insurance type, infant\u2019s birth weight, infant\u2019s sex, infant\u2019s age at enrollment, and number of siblings.",

We conducted a separate analysis for infants with sole HRV- or RSV-induced ARI and in the subgroups with LRTIs. We used the proportional odds model to evaluate the association of maternal asthma with infant HRV or RSV severity using the bronchiolitis severity score. For infants with RSV, a priori selected variables in the multivariable models included maternal race/ethnicity, SHS exposure, infant\u2019s insurance type, infant\u2019s birth weight, infant\u2019s sex, infant\u2019s age at enrollment, and number of siblings. Analyses among HRV-induced LRTIs were limited by small sample size for a full covariates model, and therefore we performed a propensity score\u2013adjusted model that included infant\u2019s sex, age, and birth weight. We performed an interaction analysis to assess whether the association between maternal asthma and severity of the infant\u2019s ARI was different depending on the infant\u2019s HRV or RSV status.

We found that infants with a mother with atopic asthma had an increased relative odds of having HRV-induced ARIs than RSV-induced ARIs compared with infants whose mothers did not have asthma. It is notable that although the prevalence of self-reported maternal asthma is higher in children with HRV (28%), the 15% prevalence of maternal asthma among infants with RSV-induced ARIs is higher than the asthma prevalence in the adult population in the United States.42 These study findings suggest that for infants with HRV-induced ARIs in particular, a familial predisposition to asthma might partly explain the increased risk of asthma seen later in life and/or that a familial predisposition to asthma predisposes infants to clinically significant HRV-induced ARIs during infancy, a viral infection that, unlike RSV, can often be isolated from young children without clinically obvious respiratory symptoms.38\n",

The relationship between maternal atopic asthma and the infant\u2019s HRV infection severity is intriguing given the described altered host response to HRV, as has been found in vitro and among subjects with asthma.40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 These data support the notion of differential susceptibility to HRV among patients with atopic asthma. Continued follow-up of these children until the age of 6 years will further delineate whether it is the subset of infants with HRV-induced ARIs and a familial atopic predisposition who will have asthma and allergic diseases later in childhood or have more severe asthma or recurrent exacerbations.23 Ultimately, this might help us to understand whether there is an altered host response or increased susceptibility to HRV among patients with atopic asthma.",

This study included a convenience sample of mother-infant dyads in which all infants presented for an unscheduled health care visit and not a cohort followed from birth. However, the study included participants recruited during viral seasons over 4 years, which should serve to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. A single episode of RSV- or rhinovirus-induced ARI was captured. It is likely that children had additional viral infections during infancy. The primary focus of this study was the association of a maternal atopic predisposition and the infant\u2019s ARI severity, and therefore we were not able to investigate the outcome of bronchiolitis incidence as in our larger, population-based retrospective cohort of mother-infant dyads.20 In addition, maternal asthma was determined based on self-report and not based on objective criteria, such as airway reversibility testing. However, we used a validated instrument and self-reported asthma in young adults in whom there is little overlap with other diseases, and thus there is high specificity.48 Furthermore, this study included objective measures of atopy. Lastly, we cannot completely rule out the possible influence of unknown or unmeasured potential confounding factors, as with all observational studies.",

            "text": "In summary, infant HRV infections requiring clinical care were more strongly associated with having a mother with atopic asthma than infant RSV infections. In addition, infants with HRV-induced ARIs who had a mother with atopic asthma had more than a 3-fold increased relative odds of having a more severe ARI compared with that seen in infants with HRV whose mothers did not have asthma. This relationship was not seen in infants with RSV infections. These findings suggest that there is likely an underlying genetic basis for the risk of and response to respiratory tract infections during infancy and that the mechanisms underlying the increased asthma risk after HRV- and RSV-induced bronchiolitis might be different. Future longitudinal investigations successful at preventing or modifying the host response to infant viral infections will provide insight into the relationship of infant viral infections and early childhood asthma, as will investigations that assess the atopic host and nonatopic host response to select respiratory pathogens.Key messages\n\u2022Infants whose mothers had atopic asthma had increased relative odds of having a rhinovirus-induced ARI than RSV infection compared with the odds in infants whose mothers did not have asthma.\u2022In infants with rhinovirus, having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with 3-fold increased relative odds of more severe illness, a relationship not seen in infants with RSV.\u2022For infants with rhinovirus-induced ARIs, a familial atopic predisposition might partly explain the subsequent increased risk of asthma and differential susceptibility to rhinovirus among asthmatic patients.\n\n",
