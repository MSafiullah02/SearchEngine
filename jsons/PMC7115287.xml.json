Sociodemographic information was also obtained. Korean- and English-language versions of the questionnaire were developed to enable inclusion of foreign students in the survey (Supplementary Appendix S1).

Evidence for these questions was from the MERS response guidelines of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.22 The cumulative knowledge score of the participants was calculated (range, 0-8; 1 point for each correct response [ie, in agreement with the evidence]).

A large proportion of the population of South Korea was unaware of the appropriate actions during the MERS epidemic. These categories measure the characteristics of individuals not inclined to abide by the self-quarantine guidelines. Therefore, this section assessed the following personal characteristics: degree of optimism about the health policies of South Korea, willingness to sacrifice for society, responsiveness to an emergency situation, and attitude toward self-quarantine and overreaction. Attitude toward self-quarantine was measured with a question asking whether respondents were willing to prioritize quarantine adherence above all personal needs (responses were categorized as yes and no). The overreaction section comprised the following 2 questions: (1) How would you react if you realized your children were in the same class as those of someone suspected (or confirmed) to have MERS (including school and extracurricular activities)?; and (2) How would you react if you realized your children were in the same class as those of medical workers at hospitals with MERS patients (including school and extracurricular activities)? The responses to the formerly involved overreactions, for example, \u201c(Do not) Allow my relatives or children of my family to attend school,\u201d and those to the latter were the opposite, such as \u201cI think children of medical workers at hospitals with MERS patients should (not) be allowed to attend school.\u201d Each question was assumed to indicate overreaction to the behavior of oneself and others.",

Correlation coefficients among explanatory variables were all <0.5, which was regarded as not having multicollinearity.23 Variables were selected for inclusion by stepwise calculation of the Akaike information criterion. Moreover, to prevent multicollinearity, a test of variation inflation factors was performed for each analysis. To assess the associations of demographic factors, knowledge, trust in social organizations, intention to sacrifice, and responsiveness to emergency situations with risk perception, multiple linear regression analyses were used. Each question regarding risk perception was aggregated to produce a cumulative score indicative of the overall effect of risk perception. Prior to analysis, the variables were tested using a Q-Q plot to verify the normality of their distribution and\u2014with the exception of knowledge\u2014were confirmed to be continuous because the ordinal values differed only slightly from a normal distribution.24 Risk perception was estimated on a scale of 1-7, and its relationship with predictors was assessed. In addition, to identify the association of risk perception with overreaction to the epidemic and compliance with self-quarantine, multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for self-quarantine and overreaction. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

Women and those with low levels of trust in central government, the medical field, and health policy were more likely to overreact. On the other hand, people with high levels of trust in the media, local government, and NGOs may be hypersensitive when an EID outbreak occurs. Furthermore, the higher risk perception was associated with only overreaction, not compliance to self-quarantine. Hypersensitivity that leads to overreaction can be explained by perceived media dependency26; however, this may have been related only to television in this research. Moreover, differences in the effects of trust in central and local governments on risk perception may be explained by South Koreans' perceptions of the roles of these government bodies. Central and local governments do not always appear to smoothly coordinate the emergency response, and this may be related to ongoing challenges about decentralization from the central governmental system.27\n",

For these reasons, the role of the mass media is particularly important because they usually provide widespread coverage of EIDs and convey information to the public.30 Furthermore, the level of knowledge about MERS was not associated with risk perception. This is not in agreement with a previous report of a correlation between knowledge and perception of the risk of nuclear explosions.31 Notwithstanding these considerations, knowledge of MERS was directly associated with overreaction and compliance with self-quarantine. This suggests that greater knowledge of unfamiliar diseases reduces the likelihood of undesirable behavior, which can lead to social problems.",

Personal characteristics were associated with responsive behaviors; however, the reasons for these associations could not be determined. One possibility is nationalism.

In this model, risk perception was related to various factors such as sex, trust, and other personal characteristics. There was a notable aspect of risk perception: it was directly associated with overreaction, but not with compliance to self-quarantine. This suggests that risk perception motivates self-protective behavior, possibly resulting in overreaction. However, it does not automatically result in compliance to quarantine, which is generally perceived as protecting others, rather than oneself. In this sense, risk perception is a double-edged sword: at an optimal level, it helps the public protect themselves from infection and thereby deter the spread of epidemic; however, when excessive and characterized by fear, it can lead to other social problems, such as overreaction and discrimination. Sandman reported that risk perception is comprised of hazard and outrage.39 The MERS outbreak caused fear and anxiety among the population, which might have resulted in an overreaction to both the response of the government and the behaviors of themselves and others.40 Our model also points to the importance of trust in medical experts and proper knowledge. These 2 factors demonstrate the potential to maximize the benefit by promoting compliance and reducing overreaction. Therefore, risk communication should not just scare people, but should create a context in which there is trust and a flow of knowledge and clear information between the authorities and the public. These conditions should prevent adverse effects, particularly in democratic states. The existing literature emphasizes these essential components of risk management and risk communication.41, 42\n",
