SARS\u2010like virus sequences that were highly homologous to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were identified in two separate complementary DNA (cDNA) pools.

It is important to highlight the limitation of this study, which relies solely on a bioinformatics pipeline, which may be flawed. However, these data raise the possibility that SARS\u2010like coronaviruses are a common environmental pathogen in the region.

Tblastn analysis using this sequence identified two cDNA clones that were highly homologous to SARS\u2010like coronaviruses. These clones were from two separate cDNA pools. The first cDNA pool was made from Carassius auratus (crucian carp) blastulae embryonic cell line and contained a sequence of 152 amino acids that covered 2% of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome and was 93.42% identical. Standard Protein BLAST analysis found that this sequence represents a portion of a coronavirus RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and was homologous to SARS\u2010like coronaviruses (Table 1). The second cDNA pool was made from Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) head kidney and contained a sequence of 88 amino acids that covered 1% of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome and was 93.18% identical. Standard Protein BLAST found that this sequence represents a portion of a coronavirus helicase protein and was also homologous to SARS\u2010like coronaviruses (Table 2). Protein and nucleic acid alignments of each cDNA clone were performed to compare with the most related coronavirus sequences (Figures 1 and 2). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the C. auratus SARS\u2010like coronavirus sequence clusters with other SARS\u2010like coronaviruses (Figure 3).",

In the case of the C. auratus, cDNA was produced from a cell line that was established in 1985.

This suggests that some carp species may be permissive to coronavirus infection. It is unclear how the identified sequences relate to the ongoing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic, although the identification of these sequences in the cells and tissues of animals in the proximity of the outbreak epicenter suggests that environmental surveillance should focus on adventitious agents in cell culture and the nearby aquatic environment.",
