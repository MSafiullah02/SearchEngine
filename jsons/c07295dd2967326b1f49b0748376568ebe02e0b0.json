This study examined the correlation between PLT count and respiratory virus (RV) infections. Methods: Patients who visited Dankook University Hospital between December 2006 and February 2014 with symptoms of suspected RV infection were recruited. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions identified the causative virus(es). PLT counts were analyzed with respect to virus, age and sex of the patient, and length of hospital stay. Results: Of the 8,147 patients, 62.8% were RV-positive, and 18.6% of RV-positive patients had abnormal PLT counts. There were no differences in the rates of abnormal PLT counts between single-infection and virus co-infection cases. In RV infection patients, the incidence of abnormal PLT count increased with age and varied depending on the RV infection type. Patients with abnormal PLT count stayed in hospital longer than those with normal PLT count. Conclusions: The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher among the elderly; in younger patients, thrombocytosis was more prevalent than thrombocytopenia. Respiratory tract infections caused by different viruses resulted in varied PLT count changes. Further systematic research of PLT count changes related to viral infections is required. J. Clin. Lab.
