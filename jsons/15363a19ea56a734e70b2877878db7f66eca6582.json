The first UL39 reaction resolved HSV type in the 5' portion of the long UL39 41 recombination (see main text). Primers and probes (SI Table 4 ) allowed differentiation of HSV 42 type in the vicinity of HSV-2 UL39 bp 2415-2428 (coordinates from Genbank M12700.1 for 43 strain HSV-2 186) from the homologous but different HSV-1 sequence in the vicinity of UL39 bp 44 2394-2407 (Genbank JN555585.1 for strain HSV-1 17+). The second UL39 reaction resolved 45 HSV type towards the 3' end of the long UL39 recombination. Primers and probes specified 46 type-specific signals in the vicinity of HSV-2 UL39 bp 2671-2683, homologous to but different 47 from HSV-1 sequence in the vicinity of UL39 bp 2650-2662 region. The UL30 reaction 48 differentiated between bp 3000-3100 of the HSV-2 strain 186 sequence from almost identical 49 regions of HSV-2v. For each reaction, 25 \u00b5l mixes were assembled from 12.5 \u00b5l ddPCR SI 50 2xSupermix (BioRad), 500 nM each primer, 250 nM each probe and 10 \u00b5l DNA. Twenty \u00b5l was 51 used to generate droplets that were amplified, analyzed and counted. The amplification thermal 52 cycling profile was 94 o C for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds and 60 53 o C for 1 minute, then hold at 98 o C for 10 minutes followed by 4 o C until analyzed.
