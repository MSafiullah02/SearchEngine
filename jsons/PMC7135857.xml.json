Cruise medicine has certainly come a long way since my first tenures on 600 passenger ships. I have had the fortunate opportunity to be involved in the evolution and advancement of medicine on board cruise ships as the medical director for a large passenger line. Through the excellent work of the Section on Cruise Ship and Maritime Medicine and the International Council of Cruise Lines, we have seen standards developed for the qualifications of personnel, selection of equipment, and other issues pertinent to the safety and delivery of quality care. At the same time, issues have evolved affecting our ability to deliver that care, including increased size of ships, increased passenger expectations of the scope of care available, disaster preparedness, new ports and the quality of local facilities available, and new technology and pharmaceuticals.",

As the industry has expanded, we are seeing careers lasting 20 to 30 years or longer, with all of the coexisting concerns of an aging workforce. This has brought with it the need for developing policies on women's health care, preventative and occupational medicine, drug screening, and epidemiologic and public health issues (eg, norovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Issues specific to the many crew nationalities and cultures that we treat are always a challenge. Critical decisionmaking regarding the most appropriate and logistically feasible means of evacuation is often required.",

The cruise lines are not in the medical business, they are in the travel business. If you think patient satisfaction is an issue in your emergency department (ED), you have never worked on a cruise ship. The Americans With Disabilities Act has created quite a challenge, attempting to meet the needs of respirator-dependent and other passengers with disabilities while not compromising safety.",

However, I am fortunate, as chairman of an ED that has a residency program, to disseminate cutting-edge information to our physicians. Additionally, in 2002, we started the annual Institute of Cruise Ship Medicine in Miami, Florida, which is currently open to all of our ships' physicians.",

Unfortunately, the US system has rarely provided quality physicians who are willing to work for 6 to 8 months or longer. I predict the continued deterioration of reimbursement and the medical care system in our country will lead to an increasing number of highly qualified emergency physicians who are willing to work more than the occasional 2-week tenure. I would encourage physicians who are looking for a tremendous challenge, one requiring a significant broadening of their emergency skill set, to consider time as a ship's physician to be a worthwhile experience, not only socially and culturally, but also intellectually.",
