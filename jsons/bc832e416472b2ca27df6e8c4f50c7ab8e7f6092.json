Thus 10\u03bcm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50\u03bcm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.",

Besides for vehicle indoor environments, a number of studies emphasized indoor transmission in airplane cabins [22] [23] [24] [25] and high-speed train [26] . For instance, Zhang and Li [26] used CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations to study the respiratory particle dispersion process (without droplet evaporation) in four different boundary conditions of air supply and exhausts in a highspeed rail cabin.

Similarly, a higher risk of infection is associated with close proximity to the source patient and decrease rapidly with the distance [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . With the same initial concentration, a larger quantity of mass released may be expected to experience a slower dilution [34, 35] . Due to the initial velocity, the exhaled gas and particles can travel in the air over a distance which is determined by the ventilation airflow, gravity force related to particle diameters and buoyancy forces of thermal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bodies [16, 17, 26, 31, 33, [36] [37] [38] . Larger particles (>50\u03bcm) may settle on wall surfaces or floors quickly because the significance of gravity is greater than ventilation. Smaller particles (0.5-10\u03bcm) may remain suspended for a sufficient time and lead to disease transmission over larger range [16, 23, 26, 39] .",

By calculating the droplet lifetimes and droplet size variation with different RH, Xie et al. [42] indicated that the droplet size was dictated by its evaporation and droplets smaller than 100\u03bcm would evaporate before falling to the ground 2m away. The shrinking aerosols would ultimately form droplet nuclei small enough to suspend in the air for substantial time. Accordingly, instead of using pure water droplets for model testing [42] , test droplets containing nonvolatile content were investigated by Liu et al. [43] and employed in our study too, which would ultimately form droplet nuclei after evaporation. Due to the great impact of initial droplet size on disease transmission, many studies were carried out to reveal the size profile information of droplets during different expiratory activities [38, 44, 45] . It is difficult to identify the actual droplet size exhaled from different patients with various human activities. Therefore, we first emphasize and adopt the initial droplet diameters of 10\u03bcm and 50\u03bcm as involved in most previous studies.",

The other thirteen people were isolated for three weeks after this trip and fortunately no one was infected by this source patient. Similarly but unfortunately, infectious cases have been found on public transport [6] , which was identified as airborne transmission. Therefore, it is necessary to study the droplet dispersion in this enclosed bus environment. By cooperating with CDC of Guangdong province, we adopted the same passenger locations and average ventilation flow rates in the enclosed bus taken by MERS patient in CFD model settings. Then the impacts of RH, initial droplet diameters and air-conditioning supply directions can be investigated as case studies by CFD simulations. Through statistics of the number of droplets trapped, suspended and escaped to predict the chance of infection, this study attempts to provide some recommendations for reducing the risk of droplet transmissions in enclosed bus environments.",

Indoor airflow is usually turbulent which can be simulated by Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models. However, the application of LES model requires longer computational time [50] [51] [52] . The Renormalization Group (RNG) k-\u03b5 turbulence model which is one of the most widely-adopted RANS models is employed in terms of accuracy, computing efficiency, and robustness for modeling indoor environments J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [17, 26, 39, [53] [54] . Thus, we adopted the RNG k-\u03b5 model to simulate the airflow pattern in the bus. More details about the governing equations and the turbulence parameters of RNG k-\u03b5 model can be found in the literature [17, 53] . The SIMPLE algorithm was adopted to decouple pressure and velocity. The second-order upwind scheme was used to discretize the convection and diffusion-convection terms in the governing equation.",

Results show that the diffusion features between 10\u03bcm and 50\u03bcm droplets are of great variation under the same air condition supply wind direction and RH. In contrast to the initial diameter of 50\u03bcm droplets, 10\u03bcm droplets tend to move faster, farther and wider at the same time.

Fig. 10 depicts the distribution of 50 \u03bcm droplets at different time under both dry (RH=35%) and wet (RH=95%) environment in the Windny mode. In general, droplets seem to move towards the same direction, and the dispersion range J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f has no significant variation between them. Actually, as a result of the short evaporation time (1.8 s) in RH=35%, droplets shrink quickly to droplet core whose diameter is 18.26 \u03bcm, and subsequently diffuse fast. It is observed in Fig. 10a2, a3 and Fig. 10b2 , b3 that droplets arrive the farther place compared to RH=95%.

During the diffusion process, some droplets' journey will end up when they deposit on the surface of the seats, human bodies or walls, while the others still suspend till they deposit or escape from the exhaust fan which is set on the front of the roof. In general, there are three final statuses of droplets when the calculation stops, named trapped, suspended and escaped, and the total number of them is 130,720.

As a result, more than 91.0% of 50 \u03bcm droplets will deposit. The proportion of suspended droplets decreases slightly from 3.5-6.0% (10 \u03bcm) to 1.3-4.5% (50 \u03bcm) due to the greater gravity force on larger droplets. There is an exception that the proportion of suspended droplets increases from 3.2-3.4% (10 \u03bcm) to 6.9-8.5% (50 \u03bcm) in the mode of Windpy where droplets are stopped by the V5L seat backs and move towards the aisle with little obstruction.",

It is necessary to investigate the evaporation and dispersion of indoor droplets and droplet nuclei in enclosed buses, which can help reduce the infection risk induced by droplet transmissions of respiratory diseases in such special indoor environment.

Body thermal plumes can be obviously seen around passengers. Moreover, there is a weak clockwise vortex in front of the patient.Such airflow features result in the droplets diffusion inFig. 7a1-a3 and Fig. S1a. The strong downward airflow from air-conditioning vents and gravity make droplets diffuse downwards firstly at t=5 s. Droplets rise both in the left and right side of the patient through the circulation after they sink with the air-conditioning wind. Then, droplets move forwards, and diffuse more widely in the right side.Fig. 7a3shows that there are a great number of droplets suspending in the bus.

Additionally, there is a flow towards the aisle under the luggage rack J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f around the patient's head driving droplets diffuse to the center of the carriage. Therefore, droplets firstly move to the left wall with the air-conditioning supply wind (Fig. 7b1-b3), then begin to spread out to the aisle. Droplets have a time-varying tendency to diffuse to the front of the bus with the influence of exhaust fan. While for case Windpx (i.e. supply wind blows to the aisle, Fig. 6d), a circulation in the xz plane comes into being, containing an upward flow in front of the patient (x=0-0.5 m). As a result, after released (Fig. 7c1-c3 and Fig. S1b), droplets firstly rise up with the impact of buoyancy force and thermal plumes, and then begin to spread to the aisle and the right side of carriage due to the air-conditioning wind. During the diffusion process, there is a relatively large area with fewer obstacles. Most of the droplets spread to the right of the patient (V6R) and move forwards to V5R, and deposit on the front seat of the patient.When droplets diffuse to the right of the carriage, the circulation airflow brings droplets to aisle or the left side of the carriage under the seat, continuing to float around. In this process, a large number of droplets deposit on the surface of seats, wall and ground.As for Windny (i.e. the air-conditioning wind blows to the rear of the carriage,Fig. 6e), airflow sinks when it meets seat backs, producing a vortex between the seat and the patient. There are two patterns in droplet diffusions(Fig. 7d1-d3), one is more concentrated near the left wall due to the backward moving, the other is that a small amount of droplets scatters to the aisle and fewer droplets deposit due to the small downward velocity on the right side of the patient. Over time, more and more droplets spread to the right side of bus, suspending in the air and moving towards the front of bus. Passengers 7B and 8A have a great risk of infection and passengers in the right J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f side of the carriage are basically safe due to the small number of droplets.",

At the meantime, the remaining half of droplets or droplet nuclei sink due to the air condition supply wind and gravity force, and subsequently float to aisle and rise up to the top of the carriage due to the airflow. The droplets diffuse in a wider range, so that they will not only gather somewhere around the sixth row. After releasing, 50 \u03bcm droplets move downwards and are mostly concentrated in the area around the patient due to the dominant role of gravity. Then, most of droplets are suspended in V6L at t=5 s, and fewer float to V5L and aisle gradually. Particularly at t=40 s, droplets are likely to accumulate in V5L and aisle, and diffuse to V6R.

The modeled bus is divided into 27 zones as shown in Fig. 3b, including headstock, aisle, roof and the other 24 zones separated by the seats. The volumes on the left side of the infected individual are numbered as V1L to V12L, and the others are numbered as V1R to V12R. The number of suspended droplets located in the 27 zones is counted to present the droplet temporal distribution features. Figures show the temporal distribution of droplets with diameters of 10\u03bcm (Fig. 12a) and 50\u03bcm (Fig. 12b) under different environment. The x axes represent the Volume No. defined above. The y axes represent the \uf065suspend=Ns,i/Nt, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f where Ns,i and Nt are the suspended droplet number in Volume No. i and total number released by patient respectively. Fig. 12a summarizes suspended droplets in the carriage under RH=35% due to the similar distribution between different relative humidity. The overall temporal distribution characteristics of 10\u03bcm droplets are summarized as follows. The change of RH seems to be little impact on droplet dispersion, such influence is embodied that \uf065suspend discrepancy varies from -0.37\u2030 to 0.54\u2030 between RH=35% and 95%. There is a similar droplet distribution of left side volumes in the modes of Windnz (to downward), Windnx (to the left wall), Windpx (to the aisle) and Windpy (to forward). V6L, where the patient is located in, appears the maximum quantity (6.36\u2030-16.82\u2030). Some droplets disperse to the other side because of the circulation airflow pattern as the exhaust is located on the ceiling near the headstock in the coach bus. Some droplets are transmitted by the forward airflow to the front of the coach bus. Besides, there are some apparent differences for the case of Windny (to backward), substantial droplets will suspend in zones behind patient (V7L-V12L). Droplets tend to diffuse to the aisle and the right-side areas in the mode of Windpx, thus their distribution is relatively even on both sides. Such characteristics lead to higher risk in the front zones at the same side of patient comparing to other zones except for the Windny mode. In contrast to 10 \u03bcm droplets, 50 \u03bcm droplets are limited to spread around the patient and accumulate in the regions including V5L-V6L and V5R-V6R. Especially for Windnz, Windnx, Windpy, there are over 18.38\u2030 of droplets and droplet nuclei gathering in V6L, subsequently decrease in the front and back of patient. In particular, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 50 \u03bcm droplets are hardly diffuse to V1L-V3L where several 10 \u03bcm droplets can arrive, because the former deposit first when meet the obstructions. More 50\u03bcm droplets can float to aisle and further to V4R-V7R. When the air-conditioning wind blows to the front of the bus (Windpy), there are 25.63\u2030 of 50\u03bcm droplets suspended in the \"roof\"",

Table. 5 shows the \uf065trap on each passenger.

The arrangement of exhaust fan results in the higher risk for passengers in front rows of the patient (i.e. regions near the exhaust fan).(5) The region behind the patient is of higher infection risk only in the mode of Windny (to backward), meanwhile droplets would like to suspend in the air in the mode of Windpx (to the aisle) when droplets spread to the widest region.Therefore, we conclude that it is necessary to clean the car regularly and keep the bus tidy since there are more droplets deposited on the surface of the object. Moreover, relatively wet environment is conducive to control the diffusion and propagation of droplets and droplet nuclei. In addition, in order to reduce the transmission of infectious disease virus in the period of respiratory infectious diseases, besides wearing masks, risk of droplet transmission may decrease sharply if passengers sit at nonadjacent seats because most droplets can only travel a limited distance from the source patient. It is also necessary to effectively use the better ventilation mode in the public transport, i.e.the Windny mode (supply to bus backward) for which most droplets deposit onto surfaces is recommended in the long-route coach bus in this study. Although further investigations are still required before providing practical guidelines, this paper is one J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the first attempts to assess the impacts of ventilation modes and relative humidity on droplet transmissions in the enclosed coach bus environment which can provide a physical basis for further prediction of passenger infection rate.",
