            "text": "In recent years, many seminal plasma proteins have been identified and characterized [1], [2], [3]; several have been associated with fertility in various species [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Four seminal plasma proteins associated with bull fertility were identified with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [5]. Two of these proteins, 26 kDa (pI 6.2) and 55 kDa (pI 4.5), were associated with high-fertility bulls, whereas the other two, 16 kDa (pI 4.1 and 6.7, respectively), were more frequent in low-fertility bulls. Based on the four fertility-associated proteins in seminal plasma, a regression model that provided the best empirical prediction of fertility was developed. Estimated fertility values, based on four proteins, were compared to actual in vivo bull fertility; there was a positive association (r\n = 0.89), indicating that the predictive model was valid. In subsequent studies, the 55 kDa (pI 4.5) bovine seminal plasma protein was identified as an osteopontin [10] and the 26 kDa (pI 6.2) protein as a lipocalin-type prostaglandin-D synthase [11]. In another study, a seminal plasma ribonuclease (14 kDa) was present in higher concentrations in bulls with poor post-thaw semen quality [12]. In stallions, SP-1 (72 kDa, pI 5.6), a seminal plasma protein was positively correlated with fertility, whereas SP-2 (75 kDa, pI 6.0), SP-3 (18 kDa, pI 4.3), and SP-4 (16 kDa, pI 6.5) were negatively correlated with fertility. Based on Western blot analysis, there was a similarity between SP-1 and the bovine protein (55 kDa, pI 4.5) previously described [8].",

Dogs with reduced fertility also had the three fractions; the migration path and protein concentration were identical to those found in the seminal plasma of fertile dogs. However, ejaculates from old dogs with azoospermia did not separate, but remained as a single fraction at a variable distance from the starting line, becoming diffuse towards the cathode. Bruschi et al. [14] also reported three fractions of proteins separated from canine seminal plasma, but did not determine associations between these proteins and fertility or seminal analysis. In the present study, using SDS-PAGE, we identified 37 bands.

Similarly, in stallions, there was a linear correlation between motility of both fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa and the relative concentration of two protein bands (19.6 and 15.3 kDa) [41].
