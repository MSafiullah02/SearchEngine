            "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety of the more than 15 million units of blood and blood components donated each year in the United States. \"Blood banking has become a manufacturing industry, an industry that must conform to high standards and quality control requirements comparable to those of pharmaceutical companies or other regulated industries,\" said David A. Kessler, MD, former FDA commissioner [ 1 ] . Screening donated blood for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusion is a very important step in ensuring safety. The United States has the safest blood supply in the world [ 1 ] and the FDA is striving to keep it safe by decreasing the risk of infectious disease transmission. The regulatory agency is continuously updating its requirements and standards for collecting and processing blood. As mentioned earlier, an important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases. In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 28 .1 ). The fi eld of clinical microbiology and virology are now focusing on molecular technology. Currently, nucleic acid testing techniques have been developed to screen blood and plasma products for evidence of very recent viral infections that could be missed by conventional serologic tests. It is time for all blood safety procedures to include molecular detection techniques.",

For indirect virus detection by virus speci fi c antibodies (e.g., an immuno fl uorescence assay or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), etc.), there is a problem in that shortly after infection by a pathogenic virus, there is a window period in which antibody generation is insuf fi cient for detection [ 2 ] .

The nucleic acid tests can also provide evidence for genetic variation in viruses. Molecular methods include the use of nucleic acid probes as well as ampli fi cation-based and DNA sequence-based techniques. An increasing number of molecular diagnostic methods are now available commercially. In comparison to classical methods, molecular biological methods are superior in terms of rapidness, speci fi city, and sensitivity. The current nucleic acid detection methods in the fi eld may be grouped into two major classes: amplifying techniques such as PCR and nonamplifying techniques such as Southern blot hybridization. Amplifying techniques are more sensitive than nonamplifying techniques. There are two different types of amplifying methods [ 3 ] , target ampli fi cation methods and signal ampli fi cation methods. Target amplifying techniques include PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based ampli fi cation (NASBA) [ 4, 5 ] , self-sustaining sequence ampli fi cation (3SR), transcription-based ampli fi cation (TAS), transcription-mediated ampli fi cation (TMA), strand displacement ampli fi cation (SDA), and ligase chain reaction (LCR). Signal ampli fi cation methods include branched DNA (bDNA) signal ampli fi cation [ 6 ] , cleavage-based signal ampli fi cation (cycling probe technologies and invader assay), Q\u00df replicase, hybrid capture, cycling probe technologies (CPT), and rolling-circle ampli fi cation (RCA) [ 7 ] . To further insure the safety of blood products, it is of importance to further improve these and other types of nucleic acid testing.",

This technique is used to detect speci fi c sequences within mixtures of DNA, which is size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred by capillary action to a suitable membrane. After blocking of nonspeci fi c binding sites, the nitrocellulose replica of the original gel electrophoresis experiment is then allowed to hybridize with an oligonucleotide probe representing the speci fi c DNA sequence of interest. Should speci fi c DNA be present on the blot, it will combine with the labeled probe and be detectable. By coelectrophoresing DNA fragments of known molecular weight, the size(s) of the hybridizing band(s) can then be determined. Southern blotting hybridization technology is one of the major tools that have already helped clinical staffs worldwide interpret genomic information. Other competing methodologies include in situ hybridization and solution hybridization. Important clinical examples of the use of this technology are DNA fi ngerprinting and the ability to detect DNA gene rearrangements.",

There is not a single technique that has had a greater impact on the practice of molecular biology than PCR. With this technique, we can detect infectious diseases agents at an extremely low level. It is based on the ability of sense and antisense DNA primers to hybridize to a DNA of interest. Following extension from the primers on the DNA template by DNA polymerase, the reaction is heat-denatured and allowed to anneal with the primers once again. Another round of extension leads to a multiplicative increase in DNA products. Therefore, a minute amount of DNA can be ef fi ciently ampli fi ed in an exponential fashion to result in larger amounts of DNA that are more easily manipulated. By including critical controls, the technique can be made quantitative. The current level of the sensitivity and detection limit is as low as 10-50 copies per ml blood in HIV testing [ 1, 10, 11 ] .",

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that two billion people worldwide have been infected with HBV and 350,000,000 people are chronically infected. Chronic infection results in a high risk for liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver, which cause about 1,000,000 deaths each year. Each year up to 200,000 people become newly infected in the United States alone. Since the beginning of screening for HBV in 1969, the rate of infection through blood transfusions has greatly decreased. However, as of 2000, HBV is still transmitted through blood transfusions in 1 out of 137,000 units of blood. One reason for this is that currently available blood screening technologies detect core antibodies or surface antigens, which appear up to 8 weeks after infection. Serologic tests for HBV include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).",

A small percentage of people become chronic carriers of the virus, and in these cases, the test may remain positive for years. Chronically infected people can develop severe liver disease as time passes, and need to be followed carefully by an experienced physician. To reduce the occurrence of posttransfusion hepatitis, it is essential to screen all blood donations for HBsAg by the most sensitive and speci fi c assays. Blood donations that are found to be reactive in the HBsAg test are automatically con fi rmed by the HBsAg con fi rmatory assay.

Detection of early HBV infection of blood donors is still a major problem of blood transfusion. The current third-generation licensed HBsAg tests (mostly radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassays) can not detect HBV in the window period for HBV infection. This is a strong motivation for introducing molecular detection techniques to the fi eld. There are some commercially available test methods for detecting HBV DNA in the market now, such as Chiron's Quantiplex HBV DNA [ 21 ] , Digene's Hybrid Capture, Abbott's HBV DNA assay, and Roche's Amplicor HBV Monitor. Using these commercial hybridization or PCR-based assays, HBV DNA can be detected 1-3 weeks before the appearance of HBsAg [ 22 ] . Some chronically infected patients who have lost their HBsAg remain HBV DNA positive, but are disquali fi ed as potential blood donors. Molecular detection of HBV DNA is more sensitive than current methods employed for HBsAg screening.",

If an individual has a positive anti-HBc test, but the HBsAg test is negative, it may mean that the person once had hepatitis B, but has recovered from the infection. Of the individuals with a positive test for anti-HBc, many have not been exposed to the HBV; thus, there is a frequent problem of false positives.

Hepatitis caused by HCV is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. Over four million Americans are believed to be infected. HCV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. HCV causes in fl ammation of the liver, and up to 80% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection, which can lead to liver in fl ammation, cirrhosis, cancer, and death. Eventually, up to 20% of people with HCV may develop cirrhosis of the liver or other severe liver diseases. As in other forms of hepatitis, individuals may be infected with the virus, but may not realize they are carriers since they do not have any symptoms. Because of the risk of serious illness, people with HCV need to be followed closely by a physician with experience evaluating this infection. Since the fi rst cloning of fulllength HCV cDNA in 1989, signi fi cant progress has been made in characterizing its molecular biology [ 11 ] . But, the natural history of HCV infection is still largely unclear and current treatment options for patients are limited. There is no vaccine for HCV, and the only available treatment, a combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin, is ef fi cacious in only a minority of patients [ 23 ] . The life cycle of the HCV is poorly understood due to the lack of an ef fi cient cell culture system [ 24 ] . There is an urgent need to develop a highly sensitive detection method for studying possible extrahepatic sites for the replication of HCV. We have recently established a cell culture system for the replication of HCV by using human T and B leukemia cell lines [ 25 ] . This model should represent a valuable tool for the detailed study of the initial steps of the HCV replication cycle and for the evaluation of antiviral molecules. Currently, appropriate vaccine strategies for HCV have not been developed. Early detection and prevention of HCV infection are most important for blood safety.",

High sensitivity detection of HCV during the window period is a longterm technical challenge in the fi eld. Tests for HCV RNA genome detection based on the PCR or other highly sensitive RNA detection systems have been used for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis [ 26 ] . Sensitive detection of HCV RNA based on RT-PCR or other nucleic acid ampli fi cation techniques can be readily accomplished with kits that are now available commercially. For example, in 1999 the FDA approved Roche's Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Ultra Sensitive quantitative assay. It can measure HIV levels at as few as 50 copies/mL and another commercial kit, the LCx HIV RNA Quantitative Assay from Abbott Laboratories, also has a detection limit at 50 copies/mL. Some studies even showed a sensitivity limit at 1 copy [ 27 ] . In fact, a qualitative assay should be much more sensitive than a quantitative assay for HIV/HCV screening. A sensitive qualitative HCV molecular detection assay will possibly interdict and virtually prevent all transfusion-associated HIV/HCV.

But, blood contaminated with CMV can cause problems in neonates or immunocompromised patients. It also remains a major pathogen for solid-organ transplant recipients causing febrile syndromes, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinitis and colitis. Potential problems in selected patient populations can be prevented by transfusing CMV negative blood or frozen, deglycerolized red blood cells. Serologic tests for antibody to CMV are useful for determining whether a patient had CMV infection in the past, a determination of great clinical importance for organ and blood donors, and in the pretransplant evaluation of prospective transplant recipients [ 37 ] . Commercial NAT kits are available for CMV [ 3 ] , and these include the Amplicor PCR CMV Monitor test and Hybrid capture system CMV DNA test.",

The most effective way of screening donors is to take a proper history of malaria or of fever that could be due to malaria. Donor selection criteria should be designed to exclude potentially infectious individuals from donating red blood cells for transfusion. Because there are no practical laboratory tests available to test donor blood, donors traveling to high risk malaria areas are excluded from donating blood for 6 months. However, there is a need to develop suitable screening tests, especially for use in an endemic area. A number of clinical research approaches have been developed for the extraction, ampli fi cation and detection of malaria parasite DNA from blood products [ 37 ] .",

BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting cattle and was fi rst reported in the UK in 1986. It has different clinical and pathologic characteristics from classic vCJD. Each disease also has a particular genetic pro fi le of the prion protein gene. In recent years, questions have been raised concerning the potential risk of vCJD disease for recipients of plasma-derived clotting factors, including United States licensed Factor Eight (pdFVIII), Factor Nine (pdFIX), and other plasma-derived products such as immune globulins and albumin. In the past 10 years, there have been some reported cases of probable vCJD transmission by red blood cell transfusions in the United Kingdom. Prion infections are associated with long and clinically silent incubations. The number of asymptomatic individuals with vCJD prion infection is unknown, posing risk to others through blood transfusion, blood products, organ or tissue grafts, and contaminated medical instruments. In order to decrease the risk, there is a need to establish a blood-based molecular assay for detection of vCJD prion infection. Recently research papers have shown that sensitivity detection methods are available for vCJD prion [ 39 ] . However, commercial detection kits are not yet available.",

Dengue has emerged as a worldwide problem only since the 1950s. With more than one-third of the world's population living in areas at risk for transmission, dengue infection is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics. According to CDC, as many as 100 million people are infected yearly. Dengue is caused by any one of four related viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There are not yet any vaccines to prevent DENV infection, and the most effective protective measure is to avoid mosquito bites. There have been healthcare-related transmissions, including transmission by blood products [ 40 ] . Dengue infection has a viremic phase that lasts 4-8 days, and blood collected during this phase may be infective when transfused into susceptible hosts [ 40 ] . There are currently no tests for direct detection of dengue virus, but there are however, commercial ELISA tests to detect antibodies of the dengue virus in blood samples from patients. Recently, research papers have shown that PCR detection methods are available for any dengue virus strain [ 41 ] .",

NAT is a method of testing blood that is more sensitive and speci fi c than conventional tests that require the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. Also, NAT works by detecting the low levels of viral genetic material present when an infection occurs but before the body develops an immune response to a virus. This improved sensitivity should enable us to signi fi cantly decrease the infection window period, allowing for earlier detection of the infection and diminishing the chances for transmission of the agent via transfusion. We are to protect the blood supply from not only known pathogens but also the emergence of new and unrecognized and uncharacterized infectious agents.
