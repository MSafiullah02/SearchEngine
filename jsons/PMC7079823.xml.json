After successful thrombolysis, treatment is continued in the isolation ward. After the patient has recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia and test of nucleic acid is twice negative, elective PCI should be considered.

The subsequent steps are the same as those for STEMI patients with stable vital signs.Perform echocardiography and ECG 24\u201348 h after the reperfusion therapy.
