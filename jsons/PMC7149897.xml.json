This change favored the appearance of the first eukaryotes; oxygen levels were increasing, and about 750 million years ago during the eon Phanero, there was a new event known as Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event that led to the appearance of the first organisms multicellular (Knoll and Nowak, 2017). On the other hand, it has been suggested that infections have been present at the same timescales through evolution. But it has been difficult to demonstrate conclusively, since no fossil elements have been found, which allow establishing the exact moment of evolution in which infectious diseases appeared throughout the evolutionary process. However, the etiological agents that produce diseases can be the result of a complex coevolutionary process. Interactions between host, infectious agents, and immunity have determined the epidemiological dynamics, which has played an important role at the evolutionary level. The coevolution of viruses and the host defense system may have been a determining factor in the evolution of both viruses and their hosts (Mideo et al., 2011). The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, with a high impact on morbidity and mortality throughout history, has been the result of the interaction of multiple environmental factors and the genetic pressure exerted by microorganisms and their hosts in both pathways.",

The phylogenomic data also indicate that the major proteins of the capsid and other proteins necessary for viral pathogenicity were acquired late, after the appearance of LUCA and LUCELLA at least 1.3 billion years ago. This is an alternative view in which the appearance of the capsid coincides with the appearance of modern cells and viral adaptations to parasitism.

When the insects evolved into new species, they provided an evolutionarily modified form of the ecological niche required for the cycle of replication of the virus, which adapted and colonized the new host. This mechanism of ecological speciation eventually produced new species of virus. In the evolutionary timescale, with the extinction of many phylogenetic lineages of the host insects and the viruses, the genes of the viruses were maintained, so a very large cophylogenetic divergence should not be expected (Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al., 2011). Findings on the evolution of foamy retroviruses, which have evolved with values above 100 Ma (Katzourakis et al., 2009), suggest that common macroevolutionary scenarios affected viruses regardless of their modes of replication or origin.",

Nearly 50 new human pathogens have been identified, with a predominance of RNA viruses, many as a result of introductions in human populations transferred mostly from other species (Domingo and Holland, 1997). Transferences between species usually mediate the appearance of pathogens through the stochastic generation of virus variants capable of replicating in a new host, in the appropriate ecological environment. Several RNA viruses, including HIV (Gao et al., 1999), SARS coronavirus (Guan et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003) and dengue virus (DENV) (Wang et al., 2000) have caused recent epidemics by changing their host ranges to increase infections in humans.",

However, comparisons of RNA arbovirus sequences reveal that they are relatively stable in nature, and genetic studies suggest that strong purifying selection dominates their evolution (Holmes and Twiddy, 2003, Jerzak et al., 2005). This stability may result from the requirement of replication in two different hosts, which presents contradictory demands for replication and adaptation and which may restrict adaptation to any of the hosts only by imposing a cost of physical conditioning where the adaptations are antagonistic (Woolhouse et al., 2001).",

Recent evidence based on the sequencing of DNA and nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Aedes aegypti supports the evidence that shows that mosquito populations in the New World are derived directly from African populations.
