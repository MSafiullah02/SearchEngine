Therefore, neither we nor the respiratory physicians recommend tracheotomy (including percutaneous gas resection) for severe COVID-19 patientsat the first 3 weeks.[\n12\n] If tracheotomy is necessary, tracheal endocrine secretion should also be prevented when performing bedside surgery in an isolation ward.
