The Public Health System of Canada is well prepared to address the COVID-19 outbreak while working with various international partners including WHO. This commitment with high level intersectoral collaboration has resulted in dedicated funding of $52.6 million given for 96 research teams to conduct research with collaborating institutions in Africa and Asia to study and enhance the clinical and public health responses and to improve global health security [7]. As described by Kickbusch et al., Global Health Diplomacy aims to capture the multi-level and multi-actor negotiation process that shapes and manages the global policy environment for health [8]. The Canadian government has engaged in global health diplomacy with G7 (Group-7) finance ministers, multilateral organizations such as WHO, international health regulators (United States Federal Drugs Administration and European Medicines Agency) and bilateral partners at multiple levels to mobilize the resources for containing the pandemic. Thus, Canada has emphasized and demonstrated how collective international public health action can build a safer future for humanity which is the ultimate goal of global public health security. A summary of the activities by the Canadian government is shown below. (Table 1).\n",

According to recent statistics, Canada ranks number five (5) in the Global Health Security (GSI) Index which is the first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across 195 countries that make up the State Parties to the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 [9]. As part of strengthening surveillance systems, the Public Health Agency of Canada ensures meeting the requirements for IHR and reports to WHO within 24 h its assessment of public health information. As of March 18, 2020, Canada has implemented a ban on all foreign nationals entering Canada (by air or marine) and also imposed a 30-day restriction on all non-essential travel at the Canada- U.S border. The Government\u2019s Travel advice and advisories warrants all persons to avoid all non- essential international travel including to United States with an aim to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in Canada. In this context, the Act/ Regulation came into force from 26 March, 2020 which prohibits entry into Canada from U.S (effective until 21 April 2020) and prohibition of entry into Canada from any country other than US (until 30, June 2020) to support its continued focus on reducing the introduction and further spread of COVID-19.",

In addition, the government is also working with international regulators to help fast-track clinical trials and applications for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. All these measures for inbound and outbound surveillance are very critical in addressing the pandemic as about 71% of all COVID-19 cases were exposed in the community while the remaining 29% were either exposed while travelling or exposed to a traveler returning to Canada [3]. The public health measures are targeted to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d thereby slowing acceleration of the number of cases in a community, reducing the peak number of cases during the pandemic and related health care demands on hospitals and infrastructure, and decreasing overall cases and health effects [10].",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges to many economies (developing and developed) worldwide which has created more barriers for free trade, restricted commercial activities and disrupted the positive spirit (e.g. the President of U.S asked the medical supply firm 3M to stop selling N95 respirators to Canada and Latin American markets by invoking the Defence Production Act in order to focus on domestic distribution). Moreover, 68 countries (Canada is not among them) have curbed exports of personal protective equipment (PPE) or medicine during this crucial fight against COVID-19 by the front-line workers. A lack of supply and surging demands have sent prices soaring for all the PPE as well as air cargo rates [11]. In spite of these challenges the Canadian government is taking steps to get its PPE supply from China so that healthcare workers and vulnerable citizens are not put at risk.",

There still remain certain challenges faced by Canada especially with the extensive land borders facilitating people crossing the borders by road, dependence on cross border road transport of goods from USA and also because of the economic downturn resulting in impacts on supply chains, commodity prices and global financial markets. There is a strong need for collective action by all key stakeholders through a multi-pronged approach to mitigate, prevent and fight against such health security threats (now and in future) through global health diplomacy. It must be remembered that enhancing the spirit of globalization, solidarity and recognizing the needs of developing countries is a more humane response than any nation pursuing a self-interested agenda which is not likely to leave a good legacy in global health or international relations.",
