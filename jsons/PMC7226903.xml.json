On May 2016, Ebola had reached Sierra Leone, and over the next month the number of new cases per week escalated. Late in June, Doctors Without Borders called for increased international support\u2014declaring that the epidemic was getting \u201cout of control\u201d. In July, two infected US aid workers were evacuated from Liberia, Ebola was detected in Lagos in a patient who had travelled by air from Liberia, and Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency in order to quarantine the epicentres of the disease. This series of events ultimately compelled the WHO to declare the Ebola outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. An international response was triggered, which included an increased influx of financial resources and health personnel, building of treatment centres in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the establishment of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).",

Guinea, where the outbreak began, was initially thought to be too challenging a setting for assessing a vaccine. However, Guinea asked to be part of the Ebola vaccine development effort, and options for clinical trials designs for Guinea were discussed during an informal side meeting. Informed by data on safety, induction of potentially protective immune response, and availability of vaccine doses, the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) was selected as the vaccine candidate. This vaccine was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, and licensed to NewLink Genetics. To develop, manufacture, and distribute the vaccine candidate, Merck entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with NewLink Genetics in November 2014. A consortium of the WHO, the Ministry of Health in Guinea, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) lead the implementation of the trial, which also involved a trial team with representatives from a number of academic institutions. Phase 1 testing of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate was planned prior to the October vaccine meeting, and was undertaken in Germany, Kenya, Gabon, and Switzerland over the next months. By January 2015, funding for an efficacy trial in Guinea was secured from a number of sources.",

This ring is randomised to either an intervention group receiving immediate vaccination or a control group receiving delayed vaccination after 21 days (the incubation period in which 95% of EVD cases arise). The ring vaccination trial is based on smallpox eradication strategy. The efficacy trial in Guinea began already four months after the first discussions about a potential trial had been held. In July 2015, the consortium released results from an interim analysis demonstrating 100% vaccine efficacy. Final results published 1.5 years later confirmed these results. No cases of Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination among the 5837 people who received the vaccine.

Firstly, if phase 1 and phase 2 trials of the Ebola vaccine had been conducted prior to the epidemic, the vaccine could have been tested more quickly, probably as much as six months earlier, and even contributed to halting the spread of the epidemic.25 It was therefore recognised that R&D preparedness\u2014understood as innovation, advancement, and production of vaccine candidates that are stockpiled and ready for testing prior to an epidemic\u2014needs strengthening. Secondly, testing of vaccines in response to an outbreak requires clarity in advance about issues such as manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of an epidemic, feasibility, scientific value, ethical acceptability of clinical trial designs, and a clear regulatory pathway towards approval. In other words, the R&D response too needed to be strengthened (Box 3). Together, R&D preparedness and R&D response represent areas that must be addressed to provide the global public good of preventing future epidemics.",

Even if stockpiles are established, the risk exists that clinical trials are delayed so much that an epidemic might be waning and almost over by the time the trials are initiated. As a consequence, clinical trials may not be able to demonstrate statistically significant effects. For example, during the recent Ebola outbreak, several vaccine trials were not completed due to the declining number of new Ebola cases at the time when trials were initiated. Reducing the time from the beginning of an outbreak until a safe vaccine is available for clinical evaluation therefore requires clarity on a number issues, such as agreement on manufacturing capacity, agreement on scientifically sound, feasible, and ethically acceptable ways of testing vaccines, a clear regulatory pathway in the states in which the vaccines are to be tested, and agreement on how clinical trials are to be coordinated and how data is to be shared.",

Fully explaining why no Ebola vaccine was available prior to 2015, or vaccines for other EIDs for that matter, requires also examining the public good characteristics of the benefits of R&D preparedness and R&D response. The classic challenge encountered by all public goods is that they are under-supplied since their two key properties\u2014non-rivalry and non-excludability\u2014prevent actors from capturing the full benefits from investing in them. Market mechanisms therefore frequently fail to provide public goods. A collective failure to provide the good results if no actor is willing to bear the costs of providing them. At the national level, governments and public authorities may use policies such as taxation, statutes, and regulations to provide public goods that are undersupplied by market forces. At the global level, no institutions exist to coerce national governments to contribute to the supply of global public goods, and nor does there exist a single global institution that is entrusted authority and financial resources to provide for such goods.",

In R&D, factors necessitating the involvement of the private sector include their existing intellectual property and know-how, R&D capabilities, manufacturing capacity, and systems for distributing vaccines. Incentivising private innovators to participate in partnerships to develop vaccines against EIDs will therefore prove vital to strengthening global health security.

Firstly, private innovators must perceive an acceptable level of risk of engaging in vaccine development against EIDs.28 CEPI\u2019s main risk-sharing strategy will be to invest directly in projects that move candidate vaccines from preclinical research through phase I and II trials, and thereby substantially reduce the total R&D cost to private innovators. Secondly, private innovators can be incentivised to engage if there is commercial potential in addition to the public objectives. For some EIDs, a commercial market may exist for the vaccine in high-income states. For example, a vaccine may become profitable in the travel vaccines market in addition to protecting populations in states where an epidemic most likely will strike. Vaccine manufacturers may also see an opportunity to receive funding to develop vaccines on new platforms that may be later applied to develop vaccines with commercial potential, in addition to the public objective funded by CEPI. In other cases where similar market opportunities are non-existent, a return on investment will depend on global financing bodies such as GAVI stepping in and procuring the vaccines at prices above the marginal cost of production.",

This could be achieved by implementing \u201cpull\u201d incentives that reward outputs of R&D instead of paying for R&D inputs.29 One example is the milestone premium where innovators are rewarded for successfully completing pre-defined scientific milestones. At the time of writing, CEPI plans to implement a strategy where it only will provide additional funding for the next phase of vaccine development if milestones are met.

Over the past 15 years, a number of different public-private partnerships such as the Drugs for Neglected Disease initiative and the Medicines for Malaria Venture have been established to address market failures affecting R&D for neglected diseases.30 These too have pooled private and public resources to pursue publicly defined objectives, and to achieve mutually beneficial goals.31 Examining the experience and lessons from these initiatives suggest three broader areas where CEPI could make valuable contributions.",

By implementing the incentives described above, it is reasonable to expect that multinational vaccine manufacturers will bring crucial know-how, manufacturing facilities, and platform technologies to the table. Leading multinational vaccine manufacturers have already actively been engaged as part of CEPI\u2019s establishment.32 Three additional groups could potentially add value to CEPI\u2019s mission. The first group is small to medium-sized commercial vaccine companies, biotechs and contract manufacturing organisations (CMOs). The second group is the members of the vaccine-industry alliance The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers\u2019 Network (DCVMN), who have an increasingly important role in meeting the global demand for vaccines as well as developing novel ones.33 A testament to their role is that of 2.4 billion doses of vaccines procured by UNICEF in 2015, 60% were sourced from DCVM.34 Finally, CEPI can also work with existing government-run and publicly funded non-profit organisations that have know-how and expertise on vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. These have traditionally been set up to focus on meeting national public health needs. By engaging with CEPI, their expertise could be leveraged to meet global needs. One concrete example is the Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. This centre was set up as a private-public private partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advances Research and Development Authority (BARDA). It is part of the US national strategy to strengthen manufacturing capacity to respond to various biological threats including novel and previously unrecognised infectious diseases, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.35 BARDA suggested during the establishment of CEPI that it could work with CEPI\u2019s partners to produce vaccines using vaccine platforms supported by the Center.36\n",

It has for long been considered that the public sector\u2019s role in R&D is primarily in preclinical research and early-stage discovery, and that know-how, resources and skills to translate these findings to biomedical products are the prerogative of private innovators. However, public-private partnerships (PPPs) established to address the market failure for neglected diseases have demonstrated otherwise. For example, between 2003 and 2016, DNDi drove R&D and marketing approval of six drugs targeting neglected diseases (sleeping sickness, malaria, Chagas\u2019s disease, and kala-azar), and has estimated that on average it can develop drugs for between $110 million and $170 million.37 This is around one tenth of the average cost of developing a drug according to estimates based on proprietary data from pharmaceutical companies, though it should be noted that these estimates are controversial.38 Another example is the MenAfriVac vaccine against meningitis, which cost $50 million to develop\u2014again much lower than the cost usually required to bring a new vaccine to market.39\n",

One specific issue concerns norms guiding decisions to transfer intellectual property and know-how of publicly-funded vaccines and other health technologies to private innovators. A recent example reigniting this debate is the decision by the US Department of Defense to grant an exclusive licence of a Zika vaccine to the pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur.40 This vaccine was originally developed with public funding by scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.41 In this case, the major objection raised by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other civil society organisations is that the license has been issued without conditions that secure affordability and access to the vaccine.42 One concern is that the patent monopol can be abused to charge prices that drive vaccines out of reach for populations who need them. Another concern is that exclusive licensing may unnecessarily delay the entry of competitive suppliers that can manufacture and distribute the vaccine to geographic regions with unmet needs. Finally, exclusive licensing can be a barrier to accessing intellectual property and know-how in order to enhance the characteristics of the vaccine so as to make these more effective in low-resource settings (such as developing more heat-stable versions). Non-governmental organisations, such as MSF and Knowledge Ecology International, have consistently claimed that exclusive licenses are unnecessary, and that the development of vaccines and other publicly funded research could be concluded by public and private actors by sharing the costs of finalising R&D.43\n",

It is expected that phase 3 trials, too, will be financed by public and philanthropic actors. In these cases, there exist fair arguments for setting conditions for affordability and access at the time when CEPI invests in them, and that these conditions follow the vaccine through its development stages.

This is similar to approaches taken by other PDPs.46 A second principle is that CEPI, while recognising that an affordable price range may not be possible to determine at an early stage when there are uncertainties around the vaccine development process, still will work with partners to establish a transparent and agreed method for determining the price. This includes considering different sources of information, including information about public and philanthropic contributions to vaccine development costs, cost of goods, expected scale of production, price of existing comparable products, cost of maintaining manufacturing capacity, and procurement agreements. A major concern is ensuring that public and philanthropic investments in R&D is reflected in the final price of the vaccine.

Governments often also exercise aversion behaviour by overestimating risks and imposing unwarranted restrictions on travel and trade. The World Bank estimated the foregone short-term economic output in 2014 due to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to be over US$300 million. The cost of health care, forgone productivity of people directly affected by the epidemic, and the behaviour of other actors\u2014such as trading partners\u2014were suggested to be the main explanatory factors. The loss in GDP in 2015 was estimated to be US$1.6 billion in the three most affected states. Neighbouring states, too, were reported by the World Bank to experience adverse economic impacts of the epidemic. Moreover, the disease can cause disruption of health care systems\u2014often in already fragile and low-resourced settings\u2014and reduce access to diagnostic services and treatments for other healthcare conditions in affected areas. Modelling based on cross-sectional surveys, interviews, and malaria indicators between 2011 and 2014 suggested that Ebola-affected areas observed a greater number of malaria deaths. The same areas also observed growing risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis due to childhood vaccinations being disrupted during the Ebola outbreak. Studies have also observed 20% nationwide drop in in-hospital deliveries and C-sections during the Ebola outbreak, indicating a likely indirect impact of the epidemic on maternal mortality.",

One is the ability to demonstrate that CEPI\u2019s mission is fully aligned with the interests and priorities of LMICs, and not driven by the interests of high-income states. A danger with the concept of \u201cglobal health security\u201d is that, instead of being associated with a concern for the collective security of people across all nations, it is understood as an agenda prioritising interventions (such as vaccines) to protect high-income states from diseases that emerge from LMICs.62 It may therefore be strategically valuable for CEPI to align its notion of global health security with \u201chuman security\u201d\u2014a concept placing emphasis on people over states with a particular concern for the most vulnerable populations.63 There may also be a concern that an emphasis on vaccines alone displaces attention and resources from strengthening public health capacities, general health services, and the push towards universal health coverage. While it is not part of CEPI\u2019s mission to engage in these areas, CEPI can still contribute to strengthening capacity for vaccine development, testing and manufacturing in LMICs. For LMICs, efforts that boost technical know-how and vaccine manufacturing capacity reduce the dependence and vulnerability of relying on multinational manufacturers for availability and accessibility of vaccines. Moreover, increasing vaccine manufacturing capacity in LMICs contributes towards increasing overall global production capacity in the event of a future epidemic or pandemic. When different partnership models were reviewed prior to the establishment of CEPI, it was noted that achieving equitable distribution of benefits would require broadening the base of vaccine manufacturers across LMICs and increasing their capacity for scale-up manufacturing, including implementing appropriate arrangements for technology transfer. CEPI has publicly signalled an intent to work with LMICs and to be a mechanism for transfer of knowledge and expertise for strengthening capacity for vaccine development and testing.64 CEPI has also actively engaged with the DCVMN, including being present at their annual general meeting in 2016.65 Moreover, CEPI\u2019s policy on securing equitable access to vaccines stipulates that CEPI will seek to reach agreement on arrangements up-front for sub-licensing intellectual property related to the vaccine candidate and accessing know-how, trade secrets and other undisclosed knowledge in order to achieve equitable access obligations.66 At the time of writing, CEPI has not more specifically described how it will move forward with respect to setting up technology transfer arrangements.

The objectives of this network are to characterise influenza viruses circulating in humans globally, to monitor the evolution of influenza viruses, and to detect and obtain isolates of new influenza viruses infecting humans, paying special attention to viruses with pandemic potential. Through this system, many low- and middle-income states had been sharing influenza viruses with designated laboratories in the US, Australia, the UK, and Japan. It became known that these laboratories had shared viruses with private companies in order for these to develop vaccines without the permission from the states that had provided the samples. The crux of the problem was that these vaccines were later sold at prices unaffordable to many low- and middle-income states. As a consequence, LMICs questioned why they should contribute to sample sharing if their own populations weren\u2019t secured access to the benefits of sharing viruses\u2014that is, vaccines at an affordable price. During the emergence of avian influenza (also known as influenza A virus subtype H5N1), Indonesia took the step of not sharing virus specimens with the WHO, and called for greater equity and access to the benefits of sharing influenza viruses with the international network. In response to these concerns and after multilateral negotiations, a new framework for sharing viruses and access to vaccines, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework, was established. The framework seeks to ensure that all states benefit equally from sharing influenza virus specimens. In addition, 50% of the running costs of the WHO GISR are covered by influenza vaccine manufacturers that benefit from the use of WHO\u2019s surveillance and response network.",

This was mainly due to the emphasis placed on the historical contribution to the problem. The proffered justification for differentiating responsibilities this way was that high-income states both contributed more greatly to the problem and benefited economically from higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the past, and therefore should bear greater responsibility for addressing the problem. Over time, and with the economic growth and increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions in LMICs (particularly in China and India), it has become clear that mitigation efforts by high-income states alone will be insufficient to reach global targets, and recent attempts have therefore been made to identify how CBDR can become a more meaningful guiding principle for global climate change agreements.

For many MICs, their mid-level GNIpc indicates some internal capacity to respond to domestic health needs. However, many MICs have also large unmet health needs (almost 70% of the global disease burden), are home to a large proportion of the people living in poverty (over 75%), and have large inequalities in health between income groups. In the context of CEPI and epidemic preparedness, the crux of the matter is to consider whether it is reasonable that these states are called upon to pull weight for vaccine development to secure global health security, or whether it is reasonable that their resources are fully devoted to ensuring priority health services for their own populations first. It here paramount to recognise that MICs represent a heterogeneous group of states which differ widely in capacity to pay and health needs. A starting point for identifying states that should contribute financially to epidemic preparedness can therefore be to identify those states with a GNIpc which indicate ineligibility for DAH. In the case of DAH, it has been argued that a transition zone is needed whereby states gradually move from being ineligible for DAH to becoming funders.85 This may equally apply to the identification of funders for epidemic preparedness (and other global public goods). The major reason for why such a transition zone can be useful is that one may want to consider mobilising financing only from states with domestic capacity to ensure priority health services for their populations.86 Directing resources towards CEPI\u2019s mission should not introduce harms or impede progress on other areas, referring back to the discussion about how CEPI\u2019s mission to strengthen global health security should avoid impeding broader efforts to strengthen general health services, but instead should reinforce these efforts.",

            "text": "The WHO was closely involved in the establishment of CEPI. The idea of establishing CEPI came, among other processes, out of a consultation meeting on the financing work stream of a WHO process to develop a R&D blueprint for action to prevent epidemics.94 To ensure a sustained strong relationship between CEPI and WHO, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was developed and approved by both institutions to clarify the respective roles of each institutions.95 Importantly, it is expected that CEPI will rely on and be responsive to the WHO\u2019s normative functions and leadership, for example on norms for data and sample sharing, liability, and scientifically sound and ethically acceptable clinical trial designs. WHO and its member states have prioritised the issue of R&D against EIDs by approving the R&D blueprint for action to prevent epidemics at the World Health Assembly in 2016.96 CEPI can therefore also be viewed as an implementation mechanism through which states may act on a priority set by the multilateral system.",

CEPI can be considered to add to an evolving global institutional framework for international cooperation to address shared challenges. It is being established at a time when various forms of international cooperation and agreements is facing greater uncertainty. It is therefore crucial that CEPI manages the trust placed in it by demonstrating the value of investing together to address a shared challenge. Over the next 5\u201310 years, it is hoped that CEPI will have successfully demonstrated to governments, private actors, and civil society organisations that collective action is the preferred strategy for preventing future epidemics and strengthening global health security.",
