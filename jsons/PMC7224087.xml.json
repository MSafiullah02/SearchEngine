The current treatment based on second-generation direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has managed to reduce side effects and the time of treatment and has led to the decrease of HCV RNA to undetectable levels 3 months after the end of therapy in more than 90% of patients [2\u20134]. However, DAA treatment alone is not sufficient to stop hepatitis C transmission. The highest prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C lays on developing countries with limited access to these expensive therapies. Also, the early diagnosis of this silent disease is hampered by poor implementation of screening methods; it is estimated that only 5% of HCV infections are diagnosed globally [5]. In addition, this treatment does not protect against re-infection in high-risk population sectors such as people who inject drugs. DAAs have still several challenges to overcome in the design of effective therapies for the treatment of HCV genotype 3 [6] and patients with chronic kidney disease (reviewed in reference 7). Hence, the development of a vaccine against hepatitis C is still a public health necessity.",

Also, a rapid drop in viremia that is observed in most humans and chimpanzees during acute infections is kinetically related to the onset of virus-specific T-cell immunity (reviewed in reference 16). In practice, although several vaccine strategies have been shown to reduce viremia after HCV challenge in chimpanzees, no evidence of a clinical impact has been shown in human trials. Currently, a promising vaccine candidate based on a recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd3) vector and a modified vaccinia Ankara vector (MVA) coding for non-structural viral proteins is being tested as a preventive approach in high-risk volunteers. However, this strategy previously failed to restore the CD4+ T cell response in a study with chronic HCV patients [17]. Taking into account this new knowledge about HCV infection, the use of a prophylactic vaccine might be a better way to significantly reduce HCV transmission.",

Also, these proteins are generally highly purified and consequently very safe [18]. A downside is the low immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, which can be solved by combining them with the appropriate delivery system/adjuvant for enhancing and directing the immune response. An attractive adjuvant platform that is being developed consists of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing unmethylated CpG motifs. These molecules trigger cells that express Toll-like receptor 9 (including human plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells) to mount an innate immune response characterized by the production of T helper 1 (Th1) and proinflammatory cytokines, making them suitable for vaccines against viral infections [19]. In addition, these adjuvants can be used intranasally and are among the few that can be administered by this route [20].",

We have already assessed a previous stage of our design in which the chimeric protein Eq1 contained only epitopes from HCV structural proteins. It was observed that immunization of BALB/c mice with this protein in alum elicited a neutralizing antibody response against a heterologous HCV cell culture along with an IFN-\u03b3-specific immune response [23].

In the case of the humoral response against the E2.680 protein, mice immunized with EnvCNS3 protein alone showed a positive antibody response with low titers in 50% of mice. On the other hand, no positive response was detected in the group immunized with NS3EnvCo alone. High IgG antibodies titers against E2.680 were only detected in the groups immunized with chimeric protein plus E2.680 (Fig. 2c).",

Immunization for the purpose of inducing a CD8+ T cell response has primarily targeted non-structural proteins such as NS3, NS4A-B and NS5A-B, since these antigens are well conserved across viral genotypes (reviewed in reference 35). Several immunization strategies have been assessed; in general these vaccines have managed to reduce viremia after HCV challenge in chimpanzee studies [36, 37]. However, no significant clinical impact has been observed. Experimental vaccines have been based on recombinant viral vectors derived from chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd3) or the modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain (MVA) combining the coding region for the HCV non-structural proteins. The vaccines were tested in healthy volunteers using a heterologous prime/boost regimen that induced broad, potent, and sustained anti-HCV CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses [38]. However, when the same immunization procedure was tested in chronically infected individuals, the HCV-specific cellular response was significantly decreased, and the CD4+ T-cell response could not be restored by vaccination. Also, the T cells that were induced were not cross\u2013reactive with endogenous viral sequences and consequently did not significantly reduce the viral load [17].",

Thus, in the present work, the recombinant chimeric proteins EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo, composed of structural and non-structural antigens from HCV, were generated, and their immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. For this purpose, the correct selection of immunogenic and conserved epitopes for the design of chimeric antigens are critical for potentiating the immune response against HCV and avoiding viral escape [35]. This selection can be aided by the use of existing, well-characterized, computer-predicted consensus strains or sequences selected in silico to maximize the coverage of potential T- and B-cell epitopes and phylogenetically reconstructed HCV ancestral sequences [39, 40]. The sequence for the design and cloning of the chimeric proteins EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo was obtained from a well-characterized Cuban genotype 1b HCV isolate (GenBank accession number AX683879) because more than 90% of HCV-positive patients in Cuba are infected with genotype 1b [41]. Also, the natural strain selected is very common in the population and contains several well-studied epitopes, some of which are highly conserved among HCV isolates of different genotypes [41].",

This antigen design allows to reduce the number of proteins needed in order to broaden the immune response against HCV. Additionally, several protein regions that could lead to suppression of the immune response were avoided. In this case, hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of E2 was excluded to facilitate induction of neutralizing antibodies that can recognize heterologous viral isolates [43].",

In contrast, the magnitude of the antibody response against E2.680 was low when the chimeric proteins were administered alone. Recombinant E2.680 protein, which was used as the capture antigen in the ELISA assay, can be obtained in a highly glycosylated and multimeric form in P. pastoris [24]. It is possible that the epitope on the chimeric proteins is hidden in E2.680 and is not detected by antibodies induced by the aforementioned formulations. In fact, Aguilar-Noriega et al. [23] demonstrated previously that Eq1, a chimeric protein containing the same E2 fragment (aa 408\u2013540) as NS3EnvCo and EnvCNS3, was capable of inducing an anti-E2 antibody response. Interestingly, these antibodies showed neutralizing capacity against heterologous HCVcc (49.9% of infectivity of HCVcc genotype 1a\\2a). Therefore, the results observed in the present work could be due to the characteristics of E2.680 protein used in the ELISA assay; rather than to a lack of immunogenicity of the selected E2 epitope (aa408 - 560) included in the chimeric proteins. The E2.680 protein is therefore not the best analytical tool for the assessment of antibody responses induced by immunization with chimeric proteins. Oppositely, high antibody titers were detected against the NS3 protein. The fragments corresponding to NS3 included in the chimeric design are highly represented on the recombinant NS3 protein used in the immunological tests: 42% for EnvCNS3 and 76% for NS3EnvCo. Also, since NS3 was obtained from recombinant E. coli [27], no post-translational modifications masking important epitopes would be expected. Further experiments must be performed in order to characterize the immune response against each epitope contained on the chimeric proteins.",

However, formulations with an appropriate immune stimulator or delivery system for enhancing and directing the immune response have been used to overcome this problem. In fact, when chimeric proteins were mixed with E2.680 protein, a significant increase in the IgG antibody titer was observed against all antigens tested. This boosting effect was also evident in the cellular branch of the immune response, where chimeric protein/E2.680 formulations were able to enhance the IFN-\u03b3 secretory response and proliferative response to E2.680, NS3, EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo epitopes.

Specifically for NS3EnvCo, a positive IFN-\u03b3 secretory response against peptide pools containing HCV E2 and NS3 CTL-response-related epitopes was observed. Additionally, a significant increase in IgG2a-subclass antibodies was induced by the NS3EnvCo/E2.680/ODN39M formulation compared to the same formulation without ODN39M. Moreover, a preliminary analysis of this formulation using transmission electron microscopy suggested that NS3EnvCo, E2.680 and ODN39M form spherical particles (data not shown), which could improve antigen processing and the stimulation of immune cells response. A more detailed characterization of the formulation needs to be performed using techniques such as dynamic light scattering.",

Similarly, a subclasses switch was observed for the response against hepatitis B surface antigen when adjuvanted with ODN1826, highlighting the importance of CpG motif on this molecule [51]. HCV vaccines containing ODN have also been tested. A recombinant immunogen containing epitopes from the HCV E1 protein and the E2 HVR1 was injected to mice in combination with alum and the ODN pUCpGs10. This formulation was able to induce high titers of cross-reactive IgG antibodies against peptides with sequences from the genotypes 1a, 1b, 3a, 4a and 6a. Moreover, a larger population of specific-antigen-secreting B cells (CD19+; CD38+) was induced [52].

The activation of TLR9 (ODN\u2019s pattern recognition receptor) induces innate and adaptive immune responses characterized by the secretion of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-6, among others, that leads to the differentiation of Th0 into Th1 [54\u201356]. The immune response in the Th1 context is characterized by the onset of a CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response that results in the elimination of infected cells [57, 58]. In the present work, evidence suggesting the induction of a Th1 response was obtained when the formulation NS3EnvCo/E2.680/ODN39M elicited an immune response that was protective against recombinant vaccinia virus coding for HCV structural proteins in all immunized mice. This result is in accordance with what has been reported by Murata et al. [59], using HCV-like particles that induced a cellular immune response in mice that was protective in a surrogate HCV challenge model based on vaccinia virus. Protection against challenge with recombinant vaccinia virus has been associated with the induction of a specific T-cell-mediated immune response against HCV antigens, involving both CD4+ T cells, mainly as inducers, and CD8+ T cells as effectors for viral clearance [59]. It is possible that ODN39M has an important role in the induction of this functional anti-HCV cellular immune response in vivo. Moreover, in previous studies, ODN39M has shown the ability to elicit an immune response that is able to protect mice against dengue virus (DENV) in a mouse model of DENV encephalitis when used as adjuvant in a protein vaccine candidate against this pathogen [28]. This result also confirms the importance of ODN39M in protein vaccine formulations.",

Given that E2.680 and ODN39M were present in each formulation, a plausible hypothesis could be that the difference lies in the structural features of the chimeric proteins. EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo were designed with different arrangements of HCV epitopes because we wanted to evaluate the immunogenicity and processing of HCV epitopes displayed in a new context. Regarding epitope selection for both chimeric proteins, it should be noted that NS3EnvCo contains a larger NS3 fragment (aa 1230-1433) than EnvCNS3 (aa 1230-1341). These 92 additional residues provide NS3EnvCo with several epitopes that have being described as possible B cell epitopes (aa 1349-1363), MHC class I T cell epitopes (aa 1360-1368 and aa 1394-1402) and MHC class II epitopes (aa 1344-1352). All of these sequences are conserved in more than 90% of HCV genotypes [60, 61]. It is possible that ODN39M enhances the processing and presentation of these epitopes, potentiating the immune response elicited by NS3EnvCo. Additionally, T-cell responses against NS3 protein have been described previously in patients that recovered spontaneously from HCV infection and those who had a positive response to conventional therapy [62, 63]. Moreover, an inverse correlation between NS3-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and viral load has been described [64]. In particular, studies in humans have demonstrated that a positive IFN-\u03b3-secreting response against the NS3 protein is related to a decrease in viral load [65].",
