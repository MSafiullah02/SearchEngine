The presence of different stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, service users and taxpayers) requires public organisations to pursue a range of, and sometimes conflicting, objectives (Arlbj\u00f8rn and Freytag, 2012; Burnes and Anastasiadis, 2003) . Moreover, it has been argued that public organisations have different goals from those of the private sector, such as ethics, equity or accountability (Arlbj\u00f8rn and Freytag, 2012; Flynn, 2007) , although the institutional mission of public organisations is to meet stakeholder expectations (Moore 2000) . These broader objectives have a significant impact on the way in which specific functions (e.g., logistics and procurement) are developed within public sector organisations and often require the evaluation of these operations in terms of much broader parameters that are related to the achievement of public interest. For instance, often public logistics is outsourced to improve efficiency, but equally it creates issues of equity and ethics when employees are no longer civil servants and become employees of a private contractor (Moschuri and Kondylis, 2006) . Second, public sector organisations have more formal, less flexible and more risk-averse decision-making procedures than do their counterparts in the private sector (Bozeman and Kingsley, 1998; Farnham and Horton 1996; Vyas et al., 2008) because they tend to be designed around the principles of the bureaucratic model. For example, public contracts are often awarded on the basis of rules and principles that are designed to ensure equal supplier treatment, non-discrimination, and transparency, to reduce the risk of corruption (European Parliament, 2014) . As described by Moore (1995) , typically in the case of public organisations the value added is not the actual result accomplished but instead it is derived from how the procurement process itself is designed and executed. The respect of laws and regulations, in the execution of the procurement process, is necessary in order to meet public goals such as equity, accountability and no corruption (European Parliament, 2014; Sargiacomo, et al. 2015) .

In fact, the business strategy and the operations are developed at the ESTAV level, with reduced possibilities for each client organisations to contribute with specific requests and dedicated arrangements. At the same time, the process of centralisation of requests requires the client organisations to equate their internal processes to the timing and procedures developed by the service provider. This requires a fine balance between freedom to operate and adherence to a centralised system with some degree of standardisation (Brusoni and Marsilio, 2007) .

In the NHS case the MSA agreement covers limited aspects of the outsourcing, and only high-level performance targets, and in the Tuscany case the outsourcing was formally governed by regional laws and regulations, which were also very limited. Therefore, in both cases, the public sector outsourcers maintain a balance between providing control and guidance, and allowing the provider the contractual freedom to operate and innovate to improve performance. Further, the balance between control, and freedom to operate, ensures that the provider remains accountable for its actions, decisions and business performance, such that risk is not transferred back to the public sector outsourcer. This finding contributes to work by Narayanan et al. (2007) who suggest that for public outsourcing less formal governance mechanism and controls maybe more appropriate. Our work builds on this idea of informal controls by suggesting that the collaboration between the two parties is a fine balance between outsourcer control (and guidance) and allowing the provider freedom to innovate to promote the performance benefits.

Similarly, in Tuscany, the performance evaluation system measures the quality of services provided, costs and the capacity to meet citizens' needs across a wide range of metrics, which are assessed on a periodic basis and reviewed at the ESTAVs' Board meetings. The requirement for a broad range of metrics stems from the wide variety of public organisation stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, service users and taxpayers) who require public organisations to pursue a range of, and sometimes conflicting, objectives (Burnes and Anastasiadis, 2003) . This finding contributes to the literature that claims many public outsourcing experiences fail to deliver what is expected of them because organisations focus on the formal provisions (governmental rules and regulations) rather than systematically measuring and monitoring performance (Lin et al., 2007; Young, 2007) .

To solve the question, in 2005 the Consortia were replaced by three publicly founded organisations named ESTAVs (\"Enti per i Servizi Tecnico Amministrativi di Area Vasta\") (L.R. 40/2005). The three ESTAVs 7 were part of the regional healthcare system with a specialised service role. The main responsibilities of each ESTAV were the centralisation and rationalisation of procurement and other functions on behalf of the LHAs localised respectively in each of the three AVs. A regional law (L.R. 40/2005) detailed the main responsibilities of each ESTAV as follows: procurement of good and services; logistics and warehouse management; management of IT infrastructure; facilities and real estate management; human resource management (payments and careers development); and management of bidding and auctions. Since 2005 (the establishment of the three ESTAVs) the Tuscany healthcare system started a progressive outsourcing of all the functions mentioned in the L.R. 40/2005 from the LHAs and independent Hospitals to the ESTAVs. Part of procurement outsourcing was already started with the creation of the Consortia but the establishment of the ESTAVs (in place of the Consortia) revised the process. The outsourcing took several years to be completed (in fact, in 2005 only procurement activities were outsourced to the threeESTAVs) and a series of additional regulations were needed in order to activate the actual transfer of each specific function. Specifically, two regional law were promulgated to transfer logistics (D.G.R., 617/2006) and IT infrastructure (D.G.R., 317/2007).
