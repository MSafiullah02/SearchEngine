During the global outbreak in 2003, the most severely affected countries were China (ie, mainland China, Hong Kong,1 and Taiwan2), Vietnam, Canada,3 and Singapore.4 On July 5, 2003, the World Health Organization announced that the last known chain of human-to-human transmission of SARS had been broken in Taiwan.5 This brought an end to the initial outbreak of SARS that had begun in mid-November 2002 in southern China and had spread internationally in late February 2003. Genetic analysis showed that the SARS coronavirus (CoV) isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, with a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to other parts of the world.6 As of July 31, 2003, 8,098 probable cases had been reported in 29 countries and regions with a death toll of 774 (9.6%).5\n",

            "text": "Anecdotal reports have indicated that noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) was effective in SARS patients with respiratory failure.11\n12 In the current issue of CHEST (see page 845), Cheung et al report on the efficacy and safety of NPPV in the treatment of acute respiratory failure, which occurs during phase 2 of SARS.7\n10 NPPV was applied via face mask to 20 patients who developed severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure without preexisting COPD in a hospital environment with adequate airflow, full personal protective equipment, and the addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the exhalation port of the NPPV device. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%), who had a much shorter length of stay in the ICU than did those who were intubated. Health-care workers (HCWs) were particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV as viral loads increased to peak levels on days 8 to 10 from disease onset.7 Thus, the major concern with the use of NPPV was whether there was any clinical or subclinical SARS-CoV infection among the HCWs involved in the management of the 20 patients. None of the 105 HCWs involved had developed clinical evidence of SARS, whereas 102 HCWs (97%) had negative SARS serology. As there were still three HCWs who had refused SARS serology testing, one cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of subclinical SARS infection that was related to the use of NPPV, although it seems highly unlikely. However, it has been reported13 that wild animal handlers in southern China may develop positive antibodies to SARS-CoV without any symptoms. Despite the retrospective nature of this study, the small sample size, and the lack of a control group, the authors are to be commended for adding more evidence for the application of NPPV in respiratory failure related to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Confalonieri et al14 have reported that NPPV lowered the intubation rate, the length of ICU stay, and the 2-month mortality rate in patients with severe CAP, but these beneficial actions were confined to those patients with underlying COPD. In a prospective observational study that excluded patients with underlying COPD, Jolliet et al15 showed that NPPV improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in 22 of their 24 patients with CAP during the initial trial, but 66% of patients needed intubation after an average of 1.3 days, mainly because of worsening respiratory failure. NPPV was well-tolerated by SARS patients, probably because sputum production was uncommon in patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia.1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n16 Nevertheless, NPPV should be applied only if there is adequate protection for the HCWs (ie, adequate air exchange, contact and droplet precaution, plus full personal protective equipment) because of the potential risk of viral transmission via mask leakage and flow compensation causing dispersion of a contaminated aerosol. Cheung et al have shown that NPPV may reduce the intubation rate and the number of ICU admissions when applied early in SARS patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The addition of a viral-bacterial filter to the exhalation port of NPPV or oxygen mask17 may reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS.",

Cytopathic inhibition was achieved down to a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL lopinavir combined with 6.25 \u03bcg/mL ribavirin, suggesting that this combination might be synergistic against SARS-CoV in vivo.26 Two retrospective matched cohort studies26\n27 have compared the clinical outcome between patients who received lopinavir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg) [LPV/r] (Kaletra; Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Park, IL) in addition to ribavirin, either as initial therapy within 5 days of the onset of symptoms or as rescue therapy after pulse methylprednisolone (MP) treatment for worsening respiratory symptoms, vs historical control subjects who received ribavirin alone as an initial antiviral therapy. The addition of LPV/r as initial therapy was associated with a reduced overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), when compared with a matched cohort that received standard treatment (15.6% and 11%, respectively).27 Other beneficial effects included a reduction in MP use, fewer nosocomial infections, a decreasing viral load, and a rising peripheral lymphocyte count.26 However, the subgroup that had received LPV/r as rescue therapy was no better than the matched cohort and received a higher mean dose of MP.27 The improved clinical outcome in patients who received LPV/r as part of the initial therapy may be due to the fact that both peak serum concentrations of lopinavir (9.6 \u03bcg/mL) and trough serum concentrations of lopinavir (5.5 \u03bcg/mL) could inhibit the virus.28\n",

The chemokine profile demonstrated a significant elevation of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-\u03b3 inducible protein-10. Corticosteroids significantly reduced IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and inducible protein-10 concentrations from 5 to 8 days after treatment. The data confirmed the T helper type 1 cell-mediated immunity and hyperinnate inflammatory response in patients with SARS through the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils.32 In addition, in patients with fatal SARS, macrophages are the prominent leukocytes present in the alveoli, with evidence of hemophagocytosis in the lungs.33 Hemophagocytosis has been attributed to cytokine dysregulation,34 and intervention with steroids might modulate this cytokine response and prevent a fatal outcome, as has been proposed for other causes of ARDS.35 However, a retrospective analysis36 showed that the use of pulsed corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality, but the study could not establish whether a causal relationship exists between the use of pulsed corticosteroids and increased risk of death. Nevertheless, prolonged corticosteroid therapy could increase the risk of complications such as disseminated fungal disease37 and avascular necrosis of bones. The optimal dose, timing, and duration of corticosteroid administration require further investigation.",

Complete inhibition of the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for IFN subtypes \u03b2-1b, \u03b1-n1, \u03b1-n3, and human leukocyte IFN-\u03b1.22 In experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV, prophylactic treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced viral replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes, and pulmonary damage, compared with untreated macaques, whereas postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 yielded intermediate results.42 These findings support clinical testing of approved IFNs for the treatment of SARS.",
