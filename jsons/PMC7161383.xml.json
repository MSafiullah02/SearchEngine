Multilateral organizations are also called intergovernmental organizations and international organizations. Member States come together under a charter of rules and responsibilities they have drawn up and agreed on. Multilateral organizations may be regionally based (e.g., the European Union [EU], the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN]), organized around a common issue or function (e.g., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]), or globally based (e.g., the United Nations [UN]). Like sovereign states, they are recognized as having an established legal status under international law. The UN is the most well-known and largest of all of the multilateral organizations because its membership draws from nearly every nation, and because it covers a wide range of issues.",

By encouraging the building of early warning systems and monitoring and forecasting routines, the UN is boosting local and regional preparedness capacity. At the end of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1995\u20132005), which strove to shift from disaster\u2013response-oriented projects to disaster mitigation, the UN adopted the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to promote disaster reduction and risk mitigation as part of its central mission.

The structures and policies that have been established to support this function include (adapted from OCHA 2005):\u2022\nDeveloping common strategies. Humanitarian assistance is most effective when common priorities and goals exist among stakeholders and responders agree on tactics and jointly monitor progress. OCHA works with its partners to develop a common humanitarian action plan and to establish clear divisions of responsibility.\u2022\nAssessing situations and needs. OCHA staff assume responsible for assessing damages and identifying needs, developing a plan of action to meeting those needs, and monitoring progress. Responses are adjusted, if necessary, using ongoing analysis of political, social, economic, and military environments and by assessing humanitarian needs to help the responding agencies better understand the situation.\u2022\nConvening coordination forums. In its role as coordinator, OCHA holds a wide range of meetings to bring together the various disaster management players for planning and information exchange. These meetings help the participants to more accurately analyze the overall status of humanitarian relief efforts as well as network and share lessons learned and best practices.\u2022\nMobilizing resources. Through the CAP, OCHA leads the drive to get governments to commit funding and resources necessary to address the identified needs. Allocation of funds has been found to be more efficient within this centralized system.\u2022\nAddressing common problems. Every crisis is unique, and both new and old problems arise. As coordinator, OCHA analyzes and addresses problems common to humanitarian actors, such as negotiating with warring parties to gain access to civilians in need, or working with UN security officials to support preparedness and response measures in changing security situations.\u2022\nAdministering coordination mechanisms and tools. OCHA, and the UN in general, have several tools with which they can better address the humanitarian needs of disaster victims. These include the IASC; rapid-response tools, such as the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination Teams and the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group; and smaller forums such as the Geographic Information Support Team. OCHA also assists with civil\u2013military cooperation, ensuring a more efficient use of military and civil defense assets in humanitarian operations.\n",

The stockpile, which is located at the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Brindisi, Italy, includes nonfood, nonmedical relief items (such as shelter, water purification and distribution systems, and household items) donated by UN member governments. The LSU is also involved in other logistical challenges, such as designing contingency plans for the rapid deployment of emergency relief flights and providing interface on logistical matters with other humanitarian agencies (such as WFP, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, and ICRC). The LSU participates in the operation of a UN Joint Logistics Center (see exhibit 10.1\n) and has co-sponsored an effort to adopt a UN-wide system for tracking relief supplies and common procedures for air operations. Finally, the LSU contributes information related to stockpiles and customs facilitation agreements (which helps speed up the delivery of relief items).Exhibit 10.1The UN Joint Logistics CenterThe UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) is an interagency facility reporting to the Humanitarian Coordinator [within a CHE], and overall to the IASC. Its mandate is to coordinate and optimize the logistics capabilities of humanitarian organizations in large-scale emergencies. UNJLC operates under the direction of the World Food Programme (WFP), who is responsible for the administrative and financial management of the Centre. The UNJLC is funded from voluntary contributions channeled through WFP.The requirement to establish [the UNJLC] was born out of the humanitarian response to the 1996 Eastern Zaire crisis, which demanded intensified coordination and pooling of logistics assets among UNHCR, WFP, and UNICEF. The interagency logistics coordination model was applied on subsequent UNJLC interventions in Somalia, Kosovo, East Timor, Mozambique, India, and Afghanistan. In March 2002, UNJLC concept was institutionalized as a UN humanitarian response mechanism, under the aegis of WFP, by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group (IASC-WG). The UNJLC core unit was subsequently established in Rome.In case of major disaster with substantial humanitarian multi-sector involvement during the immediate relief phase, the UN agencies involved may consider that the establishment of a Joint Logistics Centre would contribute to the rapid response, better coordination, and improved efficiency of the humanitarian operation at hand. . . . A standby capacity will be developed for facilitating, if required, the timely activation and deployment in the field of a United Nations Joint Logistics Centre\u2014UNJLC. The UNJLC will support the United Nations agencies and possibly other humanitarian organisations that operate in the same crisis area. The capacity includes the option to establish satellite Joint Logistic Centres (JLC) dispersed at critical locations in the [affected area] and offering logistics support on a reduced scale. . . .Upon [UNJLC] activation, agencies will establish a Deployment Requirements Assessment (DRA) Team to carry out a quick evaluation of the logistics situation and determine the requirements to deploy the UNJLC in the crisis area. This DRA Team will work in close coordination with the humanitarian authorities and, if deployed, with the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) Team. It will take all necessary measures for installing the UNJLC and draft Ad Hoc Terms of Reference (TOR) for endorsement by the relevant humanitarian authorities. In case of peacekeeping operations or in a complex environment, the UNJLC activation will be coordinated with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) or the relevant military entities.UNJLC Role and Scope of Activities\n\u2022The role of the UNJLC will be to optimise and complement the logistics capabilities of cooperating agencies within a well-defined crisis area for the benefit of the ongoing humanitarian operation.\u2022The UNJLC will provide logistics support at operational planning, coordination, and monitoring levels. Unless specified otherwise, the UN agencies and other humanitarian bodies, which are established in the area, will continue to exercise their normal responsibilities. As a result, the UNJLC will not be involved in policy and establishment of humanitarian needs and priorities.\u2022Responsibilities will be defined as per the requirements on a case-by-case basis but will, in principle, be limited to logistic activities between the points of entry and distribution in the crisis area. Detailed responsibilities . . . would be:\u2022Collecting, analysing, and disseminating logistics information relevant to the ongoing humanitarian operation;\u2022Scheduling the movement of humanitarian cargo and relief workers within the crisis area, using commonly available transport assets;\u2022Managing the import, receipt, dispatch, and tracking of non-assigned food and nonfood relief commodities;\u2022Upon specific request, making detailed assessments of roads, bridges, airports, ports, and other logistics infrastructure and recommending actions for repair and reconstruction.\n\u2022The scope of the UNJLC activities may vary with the type of emergency, the scale of involvement of the cooperating partners, and the humanitarian needs. In general terms, the UNJLC would:\u2022Serve as an information platform for supporting humanitarian logistics operations;\u2022Upon specific request, coordinate the use of available warehouse capacity;\u2022Coordinate the influx of strategic humanitarian airlift into the crisis area;\u2022Serve as an information platform for recommending the most efficient modes of transportation;\u2022Identify logistical bottlenecks and propose satisfactory solutions or alternatives;\u2022Serve as the focal point for co-ordinating facilitation measures with local authorities for importing, transporting, and distributing relief commodities into the country;\u2022Provide reliable information regarding the logistics capacity in meeting the prioritisation of targets;\u2022Be the focal point to coordinate humanitarian logistics operations with the local emergency management authorities (LEMA) or, in a peacekeeping or complex environment, with the Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) or the relevant military entities.\n\nSource:UNJLC, 2005.",

ERR, which became active in June 2002, aims to rapidly deploy OCHA staff to sudden-onset emergencies to conduct assessments and establish initial coordination mechanisms. The 35 staff included in the ERR are deployable within 48 hours of a request for their services through a deployment methodology based on the UNDAC model. Staff serve on the roster for about six months.\u2022\nThe Stand-By Partnerships Programme (SBPP). SBPP is structured on legal agreements with 12 partner organizations that provide short-term staffing to field operations free of charge when gaps arise. Partners maintain their own rosters of trained and experienced humanitarian professionals, many of whom have OCHA or other UN humanitarian experience. SBPP staff can usually be deployed within four weeks of the formal request, and an average deployment lasts five to six months.\u2022\nAssociates Surge Pool (ASP). ASP, which was created in late 2010, helps to bridge the gap between the immediate response surge and the arrival of regular staff. ASP comprises external disaster management staff who can be deployed for up to six months upon the issuance of a Temporary Appointment. Contracting and deployment preparations take an average of three to four weeks. The ASP can deploy humanitarian affairs officers, information management officers, and public information officers.\u2022\nRoaming Emergency Surge Officers (RESOs) and Roaming Operations Stability Officers (ROSOs). The RESO and ROSO positions were created following a need to have senior surge staff available to deploy to new and escalating emergencies for up to three months to provide leadership and stability to OCHA operations. They spend 80 percent of their time in the field and 20 percent at headquarters. When not in the field, RESOs and ROSOs work with the Surge Staff Development Team to develop and deliver trainings and support lesson learning and other exercises to improve OCHA emergency response during non-deployment periods.\n",

Area-based development and local governance programs play key roles in recovery from conflict because they tailor emergency, recovery, and development issues across a country area by area, based on differing needs and opportunities. Area-based development helps bring together different actors at the operational level, promoting enhanced coordination, coherence, and impact at field level. Area-based development is often seen as the core mechanism that most benefits reintegration.\u2022\nDeveloping comprehensive reintegration programs for IDPs, returning refugees, and ex-combatants. Internal displacement, returning refugees, and demobilized former combatants create a huge need for in-country capacity building on different levels. Protection and security become serious issues, and efforts to sustainably reintegrate these populations into their host communities are critical. BCPR provides expertise on reintegration of IDPs, returnees, and ex-combatants, including capacity building benefiting both the returnees and the formerly displaced, as well as their host communities, through activities such as income generation, vocational training, and other revitalization activities.\u2022\nSupporting economic recovery and revitalization.

In the wake of the war, UNDP demonstrated that developing and building on strong partnerships is key to ensuring a fast and well-targeted response. An estimated 300,000 IDPs gathered in camps during the first half of 2009. Many of them lacked basic documentation, making it difficult to access basic services and prove claims to land and assets.UNDP assisted the registrar general to establish a temporary office inside one of the largest camps with capacity to process 50 birth and marriage certificates per day, complemented by additional staffing capacity in Colombo to handle the increased number of document requests. Between July and December the camp office processed close to 10,000 requests, prioritizing those from children who needed identification to sit for national school exams. UNDP also supported mine action coordination and management. Survey and clearance activities advanced rapidly, and by the end of 2009 a total of 879 square kilometers of land had been released for resettlement. This allowed the pace of returns and resettlements to increase exponentially in the fourth quarter of 2009, with over 150,000 IDPs returning or resettling.In the Eastern Province, FAO, ILO, WFP, UNHCR, and UNDP continued to champion the \u201cdelivering as one\u201d approach to support community-based recovery and contribute to the stability of returnees in selected divisions of the East. As the funding conduit, UNDP was in charge of the overall coordination of project implementation while also directly implementing small-scale infrastructure construction such as roads, wells, and community centers (which provided a space for cooperatives and trading groups to come together).The selection of target communities was informed through village profile maps and data generated by UNHCR, while WFP provided six months\u2019 worth of food supply rations, until the foundations for agricultural self-reliance and food security for resettled families were laid. UNDP also launched a new initiative in 2009 to foster partnerships between Sri Lanka\u2019s manufacturers and resettled communities. UNDP, with its presence in the field, played a catalytic role, identifying the resettled communities, facilitating meetings with the large consumer companies, securing fair and long-term contracts, and supporting training as well as supply of equipment to improve production. Through this project, 450 farming and fishing families in the North and the East have secured income for the next two to three years.Based on: UNDP, 2010.Exhibit 10.4Role of UNDP in Bangladesh after Cyclone Aila, 2009On May 25, 2009, Cyclone Aila hit southern Bangladesh, resulting in widespread tidal flooding and the destruction of large parts of the region\u2019s protective embankment network. Economic losses were estimated at $106 million and more than 29,000 families were affected in Satkhira, the district that had also suffered the most from Cyclone Sidr in 2007. Many of the affected were still recovering from the impact of the earlier disaster. The government of Bangladesh provided emergency relief and planned for the reconstruction of the damaged embankment network, but many of the most vulnerable families have been unable to return to their homes, which remain submerged.With funding from the UNDP Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR), an early recovery program focused on livelihoods was developed, covering all villages in the worst-affected part of Satkhira. The program included a cash-for-work component that built on self-recovery efforts of affected families. This resulted in the creation of an estimated 37,400 work days devoted to road repair and ground elevation. The program also included support for the restoration of essential community infrastructure; support to local small enterprises through working capital grants for carpentry tools, sewing machines, and tea stall equipment; and assistance for home-based income-generating activities, such as vegetable cultivation, crab fattening, handicrafts, poultry rearing, and fish drying. This effort benefited more than 4,000 families.Based on: UNDP, 2010.",

An example of such assistance includes the establishment and administration of a UN DMT Emergency Information and Coordination (EIC) Support Unit. Special grants of up to $1.1 million also may be provided, allocated from the Special Programme Resources funds for technical assistance to post-disaster recovery efforts following natural disasters. See exhibit 10.5\nfor information about the UNDP Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI).Exhibit 10.5The Un Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI)CADRI was created in 2007 as a joint program of the UNDP Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (UNDP/BCPR), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). Recognizing that capacity development is a cross-cutting activity for disaster risk reduction as stipulated in the Hyogo Framework (HF), CADRI\u2019s creation is designed to support all five priorities of the HF. CADRI was formally launched by the three organizations at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction Meeting, June 2007, Geneva.CADRI succeeds the UN Disaster Management Training Programme (DMTP), a global learning initiative, which trained United Nations, government, and civil society professionals between 1991 and 2006. DMTP is widely known for its pioneering work in developing high-quality resource materials on a wide range of disaster management and training topics. More than 20 trainers\u2019 guides and modules were developed and translated.CADRI\u2019s design builds on the success and lessons learned from the DMTP and reflects the significant evolution in the training and learning field since the start of the DMTP, particularly regarding advances in technology for networking and learning purposes. CADRI\u2019s design also reflects the critical role that the UN system plays at the national level in supporting governments\u2019 efforts to advance disaster risk reduction. In the context of the UN\u2019s increasingly important role, CADRI provides capacity enhancement services to the UN system at the country level as well as to governments. These include learning and training services and capacity development services to support governments to establish the foundation for advancing risk reduction.Based on: CADRI, 2010.",

EMOPS works closely with the UNICEF Programme Division, managing the UNICEF Emergency Programme Fund (EPF; see the following section) and ensuring close interagency coordination with other participating humanitarian organizations. In this role, UNICEF is also in the position to act as coordinator in specific areas in which it is viewed as the sector leader. For instance, UNICEF was tasked with leading the international humanitarian response in the areas of water and sanitation, child protection, and education for the 2004 Asia tsunami and earthquake response. (In Aceh province alone, more than 250 agencies addressed water and sanitation issues.) UNICEF maintains that humanitarian assistance should include programs aimed specifically at child victims. Its relief projects generally provide immunizations, water and sanitation, nutrition, education, and health resources. Women are recipients of this aid as well, because UNICEF considers women to be vital in the care of children. (See exhibit 10.6\n.)Exhibit 10.6UNICEF Operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 2009By the end of the three weeks of fighting in early 2009 in Gaza, 350 children had been killed and 1,600 injured, and much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, including schools, health facilities, and vital infrastructure for water and sanitation, had been damaged.UNICEF was on hand to provide humanitarian support. It led the collective efforts of UN agencies on the ground to restore education, provide emergency water supplies and sanitation, maintain nutritional standards, and protect children from further harm.From the early days, UNICEF made sure that first aid and emergency medical kits, essential drugs, and water purification tablets flowed into Gaza. Emergency education supplies such as classroom tents and School-in-a-Box kits maintained some sense of continuity and normalcy for children. UNICEF and its partners were able to reach more than 200,000 school-age children.UNICEF raised global awareness of the harm being done to children through extensive media coverage and advocacy. Attention was also raised by the visits of the Special Representative of the Secretary\u2013General for Children and Armed Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy\u2014who called for the protection of children\u2014and UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman, as well as Goodwill Ambassadors Mia Farrow and Mahmoud Kabil.UNICEF also extended psychosocial services, including in-depth counselling and structured recreational activities, across Gaza. Training reinforced the capacities of psychosocial workers to protect children and help them heal. Radio programmes and 200,000 leaflets designed for children warned of the risks of mines and unexploded ordnance left behind.UNICEF water tankers ensured a steady supply of clean drinking water to 135 schools with 110,000 students, while desalination units were installed to rid water of dangerous concentrations of chlorides and nitrates. To thwart the risk of acute malnutrition, UNICEF worked through 53 health clinics for mothers and children to offer supplements of micronutrients and fortified food.The quality and supply of teaching materials were improved through UNICEF\u2019s provision of math and science teaching kits. Programmes for vulnerable adolescents concentrated on supporting remedial learning, relieving stress, and providing life skills-based education and opportunities to engage in civic activities. Through UNICEF\u2019s systematic advocacy with partner organizations, almost half the attendees were girls.Source:UNICEF, 2010.",

The WFP Policy on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, approved in 2011, highlights this role as being central to the organization\u2019s work. WFP DRR programs seek to build resilience and reduce risk through such activities as soil and water conservation, rehabilitating infrastructure, and training community members in disaster risk management and livelihood protection. The MERET project in Ethiopia is one example. This program targets food-insecure communities in degraded fragile ecosystems prone to drought-related food crises. Other programs maintained by WFP include:\u2022\nR4 Resilience Initiative: The Rural Resilience Initiative (R4) is a partnership between WFP and Oxfam America, with support from global reinsurance company Swiss Re, to test a new, comprehensive disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation approach. The program allows cash-poor farmers and rural households to pay for index insurance with their own labor, so they can both manage and take risks to build resilient livelihoods.\u2022\nLivelihoods Early Assessment and Protection (LEAP): WFP has been assisting the government of Ethiopia to develop an integrated risk management system through the Livelihoods Early Assessment and Protection (LEAP) project. LEAP provides early warning data on food security that allows a rapid scale-up of the \u201cNational Productive Safety Net Programme\u201d by activating contingency plans. When a serious drought or flood is detected, resources from a US$160 million contingency fund are made immediately available to ensure early and more effective emergency response, thereby protecting livelihoods and saving lives.\u2022\nThe Joint WFP/IFAD Weather Risk Management Facility (WRMF): WRMF supports the development of innovative weather and climate risk management tools, such as weather index insurance (WII). The goal of these programs is to improve quality-of-life issues and to reduce the incidence of food shortages.

Food is transported to the affected location and delivered to storage and distribution centers. (See figure 10.3\n.) The distribution is carried out according to pre-established needs assessments performed by OCHA and the UNDP. The WFP distributes food through contracted NGOs that have the vast experience and technical skills to plan and implement transportation, storage, and distribution. The principal partners in planning and implementation are the host governments, who must request the WFP aid, unless the situation is a CHE without an established government, in which case the UN Secretary\u2013General makes the request. The WFP works closely with all responding UN agencies to coordinate an effective and broad-reaching response, because food requirements are so closely linked to every other vital need of disaster victims. (See exhibit 10.7\n.) Figure 10.4\nis an infographic showing how WFP responds in an emergency situation.Exhibit 10.7WFP Disaster Response SystemWFP response begins at the request of the affected country\u2019s government.1.In the early days of an emergency, while the first food supplies are being delivered, Emergency Assessment teams are sent in to quantify exactly how much food assistance is needed for how many beneficiaries and for how long. They must also work out how food can best be delivered to the hungry.2.Equipped with the answers, WFP draws up an Emergency Operation (EMOP), including a plan of action and a budget. [The EMOP] lists who will receive food assistance, what rations are required, the type of transport WFP will use, and which humanitarian corridors lead to the crisis zone.3.Next, WFP launches an Appeal to the international community for funds and food aid. The agency relies entirely on voluntary contributions to finance its operations, with donations made in cash, food, or services. Governments are the biggest single source of funding. [More than 60 governments support WFP\u2019s worldwide operations.]4.As funds and food start to flow, WFP\u2019s logistics team works to bridge the gap between the donors and the hungry. [In 2012, the agency delivered 4.8 million metric tons of food aid by air, land, and sea.] (WFP 2014)\nShips carry the largest WFP cargo, their holds filled to the brim with 50,000 tons or more of grain, cans of cooking oil, and canned food; the agency has 40 ships on the high seas every day, frequently rerouting vessels to get food quickly to crisis zones. In extreme environments, WFP also uses the skies to reach the hungry, airlifting or airdropping food directly into disaster zones.Before the aid can reach its country of destination, logistics experts often need to upgrade ports and secure warehouses. Trucks usually make the final link in WFP\u2019s food chain, transporting food aid along the rough roads that lead to the hungry. Where roads are impassable or nonexistent, WFP relies on less conventional forms of transport: donkeys in the Andes, speedboats in the Mozambique floods, camels in Sudan, and elephants in Nepal. At this stage, local community leaders work closely with WFP to ensure rations reach the people who need it most: pregnant mothers, children, and the elderly.Based on: WFP, 2005.",

(See exhibit 10.9\n).Exhibit 10.92014 Strategic Humanitarian Overview \u2013 Haiti, South Sudan, and YemenHaitiHaiti cannot afford to become a forgotten crisis. Important progress has been made in recent years, but the country is still one of the most exposed to risk from disaster and climate change. Multiple disasters combined with high unemployment, increased inequality, and poor access to basic social services have prolonged the vulnerability of an estimated three million Haitians to displacement, food insecurity, and fragile living conditions. Haiti suffers the world\u2019s largest cholera epidemic, which has affected over 600,000 people and killed 8,000. The humanitarian community estimates that 817,000 people in 35 of Haiti\u2019s 140 communes require humanitarian aid. Against this backdrop, the Haiti Humanitarian Action Plan (HAP) 2014 aims to respond to and minimise critical humanitarian needs of displaced populations, and people affected by cholera, food insecurity, and malnutrition. It also seeks to strengthen national capacity to coordinate and respond to humanitarian needs in case of crisis. The HAP does not include all humanitarian sectors or clusters of intervention and focuses primarily on the most critical and life-saving needs.Requirements: $169 MillionFunding received against requirements: 43%People in need: 817,000People to receive help: 396,000\nSouth SudanAlthough the humanitarian situation in South Sudan has stabilized on several fronts, needs remain high\u2014driven primarily by violence and displacement, persistent food insecurity, and chronic poverty. National capacity to deliver basic services is low, with aid agencies the main providers of health care, clean water, livelihoods support, and other services in many parts of the country.While needs are expected to remain high in 2014\u20132016, in some areas such as food insecurity, there are opportunities for innovative and more targeted approaches to break recurring cycles of hardship. The strategy for 2014\u20132016 has three objectives: responding to immediate needs, enhancing communities\u2019 resilience against shocks and stresses, and building national capacity to deliver basic services. Alongside core programmes to save lives and ease suffering, partners are increasingly integrating actions to reduce the risk of natural disasters, strengthen and diversify livelihoods, and address the long-term needs of vulnerable groups, including refugees and children. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of delivering aid in partnership with line ministries and national NGOs to ensure humanitarian relief has a long-term positive impact. The strategy spans three years, to better address deep-rooted challenges and measure the impact of relief actions.Requirements: $1.1 billionFunding received against requirements: 55%People in need: 4.4 millionPeople to receive help: 3.1 million\nYemenIn Yemen, more than half the population needs some form of humanitarian aid. The collapse of basic services in 2011\u201312, endemic food insecurity, destroyed or damaged livelihoods and under-development, along with displacement resulting from conflict, have combined to plunge the country into a humanitarian emergency which may persist into 2015. Inflows of refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa and returning Yemeni migrants count among the vulnerable. Ten and a half million people are food-insecure or severely food-insecure, and 1,080,000 children under five suffer from acute or severe malnutrition. About half the population has no access to adequate water sources or sanitation facilities, and a further 8.6 million have insufficient access to health services. An estimated 250,000 returnees need assistance to rebuild their lives, while 240,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia, and tens of thousands of mainly Ethiopian migrants are stranded in the country. It is expected that the number of returning Yemeni migrants, estimated to be 360,000 people, will double in 2014. The weakness of rule-of-law institutions has been identified as a serious protection risk. The 2014\u20132015 humanitarian strategy prioritises life-saving interventions for the most vulnerable groups in Yemen, with a second strand of interventions designed to promote transition towards recovery.Requirements: $591 millionFunding received against requirements: 51%People in need: 14.7 millionPeople to receive help: 7.6 million\nSource:United Nations, 2014b.",

            "text": "In addition to the UN agencies discussed previously, which tend to be the primary agencies involved in all forms of disaster management, a handful of organizations provide more focused assistance as deemed necessary in most disasters that require international participation. As illustrated in figure 10.7\n, which details UN assistance to the various countries affected by the December 2004 Asian tsunami and earthquake events, a different mix of UN assistance is needed in each country, even within the same international disaster scenario. Several of these organizations are detailed in the following list.\u2022\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO works with the affected population to address issues related to employment, including job creation, skills training, employment services, small business assistance, and other functions. (See exhibit 10.10\n.)Exhibit 10.10ILO Press Release \u2013 Service Sector Severely Affected by Typhoon HaiyanAccording to the latest ILO estimates, 2.8 million out of the 5.6 million workers who have either temporarily or permanently lost their livelihoods were working in the service sector. Over one third, or 1.8 million, were in agriculture and around 15 per cent in the industry sector.\u201cService sector includes people working in shops, public markets, restaurants, vendors, tricycle and jeepney drivers, mechanics, clerks, teachers, . . . who, like farmers and fisherfolks, have seen their source of income wiped away,\u201d said ILO Philippine Office Director Lawrence Jeff Johnson.\u201cAt least 2.4 million affected workers were already in a vulnerable situation before the typhoon struck, often living at or near the poverty line, doing whatever work they could find to survive and provide for their families. These people have lost the little they had to begin with. They have no home, no income, no savings and no one to turn to for help,\u201d said Director Johnson.\u201cAs the reconstruction efforts gather pace, the number one priority is to ensure that these workers have access to decent jobs, which include at least minimum wage, social protection, and safe working conditions,\u201d Johnson said.The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) are rolling out emergency employment programmes to respond to the enormous reconstruction and livelihoods needs. The ILO is working closely with them as well as with local governments, business\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations, and international partners.\u201cThese programmes comply with Philippine regulation and international labour standards, ensuring that people are not exploited while they help to rebuild their communities and local economies,\u201d Johnson explains.Workers under the emergency employment programmes receive the minimum wage prevailing in the area and are employed for a minimum of 15 days. They also have access to social protection benefits.\u201cThis is a very first step to jump start the economy and quickly put the affected communities back in the driver\u2019s seat in rebuilding their lives. Ensuring minimum wage and social protection will help stimulate economic growth and speed the recovery process.\u201d Johnson said.Source:ILO, 2013.\u2022\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM). The IOM provides rapid humanitarian aid to displaced populations by supplying emergency shelter, transporting relief materials, and assisting in medical evacuations. The organization stabilizes populations through the provision of short-term community and microenterprise development programs. IOM also actively supports governments in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of affected communities by being the lead service provider of:\u2022Transitional shelters\u2022Health care services\u2022Counter-trafficking activities\u2022Psychosocial activities\u2022Capacity building for disaster\u2022Transportation and logistics\u2022Registration and information management of affected populations\u2022Return and reintegration of both IDPs and demobilized combatants\n\u2022\nInternational Telecommunications Union (ITU). The ITU is concerned with increasing the role of telecommunications in disaster situations.\u2022\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO is the specialized UN agency for meteorology, operational hydrology, and related geophysical sciences. WMO plays a leading role in international efforts to monitor and protect the environment. For instance, in collaboration with UN agencies and the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, WMO supports the implementation of relevant conventions such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the International Convention to Combat Desertification, and the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Protocols and Amendments. In the specific case of weather-, climate-, and water-related hazards, which account for nearly 90 percent of all natural disasters, WMO\u2019s programs provide advance warnings to help save lives and reduce damage to property and the environment. WMO also contributes to reducing the impacts of human-made disasters, such as those associated with chemical and nuclear accidents, and with natural hazards like forest fires and volcanic eruptions. Several of WMO\u2019s scientific and technical programs related to disaster management include:\u2022\nThe WMO World Weather Watch Programme. Coordinates the preparation and distribution of weather, climate, and hydrological data, analyses, and forecast products to all nations.\u2022\nThe WMO Tropical Cyclone Programme. Promotes the establishment of national and regionally coordinated systems to ensure effective preparedness so that the loss of life and damage caused by tropical cyclones and associated phenomena are reduced to a minimum.\n\u2022\nThe WMO Public Weather Services Programme. Supports national meteorological and hydrological services in disaster reduction planning by providing routine forecasts and information to enhance nations\u2019 social and economic well-being.\u2022\nThe World Climate Programme. Provides an authoritative international scientific voice on climate, climate variations, and climate change. It has provided advanced climate database management systems to many countries, with applications in several areas of disaster mitigation, especially drought.\u2022\nThe WMO World Weather Research Programme. Aims to develop improved and cost-effective techniques for forecasting high-impact weather and promote their applications among countries.\u2022\nThe Hydrology and Water Resources Programme. Assists the national hydrological services of member countries to assess risk and forecast water-related hazards, particularly major floods and droughts.\u2022\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The mission of UNAIDS is to lead, strengthen, and support an expanded response to HIV and AIDS, including preventing the transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV, and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. In times of humanitarian crisis, whether natural, man-made, or conflict-related, UNAIDS works with victims to protect them from the kinds of violence and activity that spreads HIV. In 2001, the UN General Assembly held a special session on HIV/AIDS and declared that through UNAIDS:[The UN would] develop and begin to implement national strategies that incorporate HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, care, and treatment elements into programs or actions that respond to emergency situations, recognizing that populations destabilized by armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies, and natural disasters, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and in particular, women and children, are at increased risk of exposure to HIV infection; and, where appropriate, factor HIV/AIDS components into international assistance programs. (UN 2005)\n\n\u2022\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). UNFPA works to promote basic human rights throughout the world, and to increase the possibilities of women and young people to lead healthy and productive lives. Their work focuses specifically on reproductive health and safe pregnancies and deliveries. During humanitarian crises, there is often a demand for reproductive health services even though distribution and health care systems have broken down. UNFPA works closely with its humanitarian relief partners to support early and effective action to meet the reproductive health needs of refugees, IDPs, and others caught in crisis situations. Supply shortages compound health risks in already dangerous situations and are a major obstacle to reproductive health in emergencies. Existing supplies may fall far short of demand when large numbers of people move into a safer location. Supplies, equipment, and medicine are organized and stored by UNFPA for immediate distribution when an earthquake, flood, violent conflict, or other crisis arises. A rapid-response fund enables UNFPA to mount a quick response to emergencies, especially in the initial stages. Supplies are packaged in 12 different emergency reproductive health kits, including a \u201cclean birthing kit.\u201d Once an emergency situation stabilizes, the procurement of reproductive health materials becomes a regular part of a more comprehensive healthcare program.\u2022\nUnited Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat). UN-Habitat is mandated by the UN General Assembly to \u201cpromote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all\u201d (UN 2014). UN-Habitat is mandated through the Habitat Agenda (a global settlement plan adopted in June 1996 by the international community) to take the lead in mitigation, response, and post-disaster rehabilitation capabilities in human settlements. The Habitat Agenda clearly outlines the link between human settlement development and vulnerability to disasters. In addition, it emphasizes the need for coordination and close partnerships with national and local governments, as well as civil society. Finally, the Habitat Agenda recognizes the strong impact disasters have on women, and affirms the need for women\u2019s active involvement in disaster management. These steering principles underpin all normative and operational activities of the UN-Habitat Disaster Management Programme (DMP). DMP operates under the Disaster, Post-conflict and Safety Section (DPCSS), Urban Development Branch. It was created to marshal the resources of UN-Habitat and other international agencies to provide local government, civil society, and the private sector with practical strategies for mitigating and recovering from conflicts and natural disasters in the context of human settlements. Specific areas of attention include:\u2022Protecting and rehabilitating housing, infrastructure, and public facilities\u2022Providing technical and policy support to humanitarian agencies before and after crisis in the context of human settlements\n\u2022Building partnerships and providing complementary expertise in resettlement of displaced persons and refugees\u2022Restoring local social structures through settlement development\u2022Rehabilitating local government structures and empowering civil society\u2022Land and settlements planning and management for disaster prevention\n",

The organization has lead agency status within the United Nations system for coordinating activities related to human settlement. It is mandated in this role through the Habitat Agenda. The organization\u2019s responsibilities in this regard are to support national governments, local authorities, and civil society in ensuring that risk is not retained in the reconstruction housing that follows the event. Housing reconstruction often begins soon after the disaster has occurred, and UN-Habitat seeks to deploy quickly to ensure that resilient building practices are incorporated into the recovery planning process.\u2022\nUnited Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). UNEP is the UN agency focused on the protection of the environment and wise use of natural spaces. UNEP has several divisions that address global emergency and disaster management needs.\u2022UNEP\u2019s Disasters and Conflicts sub-program was created to assess and address the environmental impacts of disasters and conflicts, especially as they relate to human health, livelihoods, and security. Since 1999, this program has responded to crises in more than 40 countries. Their assistance is provided to other UN agencies responding as well as directly to the host country government.

The organization supports developing countries in their efforts to identify and address risk specifically related to changing temperature and precipitation that are associated with global climate change patterns, including sea level rise. One of the primary functions of this office is to help governments to integrate climate change adaptation policy throughout all sectors of government, such that it becomes a major policy goal rather than a distinct, stove-piped component of government. Finally, UNEP promotes sustainable land-use management and helps countries identify opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, which are often blamed for the bulk of climate variability.\u2022\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO\u2019s goal is to contribute to the peace and security of the world through education, science, and culture. UNESCO has been involved in disaster management for decades. This organization advocates for the need for a shift in emphasis from relief and emergency response to prevention and increased preparedness and education of potentially affected populations. It strongly supports the design and dissemination of mitigation measures, as well as public education and awareness. UNESCO works to increase the role of academic and research sectors in creating risk and vulnerability reduction measures, and supports existing and new institutions through financial and material support. UNESCO proclaims that their function regarding disaster management is:To promote a better understanding of the distribution in time and space of natural hazards and of their intensity, to set up reliable early warning systems, to devise rational land-use plans, to secure the adoption of suitable building design, to protect educational buildings and cultural monuments, to strengthen environmental protection for the prevention of natural disasters, to enhance preparedness and public awareness through education and training communication and information, to foster post-disaster investigation, recovery and rehabilitation, to promote studies on the social perception of risks. (UNESCO 2004)\n\u2022\nThe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). In 2010, the UN General Assembly created UN Women, which merged four existing UN organizations that focused exclusively on gender equality and women\u2019s issues. These included the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI), and the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). UN Women works to ensure that the needs of women are considered in disaster planning and preparedness efforts, as well as in the aftermath of disasters and in the recovery from them, when women face extraordinary vulnerabilities. UN Women provides financial and technical assistance to innovative programs and strategies to foster women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality. (See exhibit 10.11\n.)Exhibit 10.11UN Women Press Release: Lives Saved in Viet Nam by Involving Women in Disaster PlanningFor millions of people in rural Viet Nam, the impacts of climate change are mounting and sometimes deadly. As weather patterns change, many of Viet Nam\u2019s women in particular are paying a high price.\u201cThe weather becomes more extreme and erratic. Storms, heavy rains, and floods destroy fields and houses, kill animals and people every year,\u201d said Ranh Nguyen, 35, a farmer and the head of the Women\u2019s Union group in An Dung commune, in Binh Dinh province, central Viet Nam.There, Ranh and her neighbours have joined the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union and are working with UN Women to strengthen the role of women in disaster risk-reduction and disaster-reduction management.Some 80 kilometers from the city of Binh Dinh, An Dung commune is always at high risk of flooding, as it only has one road connecting it to other communes,and landslides often occur during the storm season. Almost every year, the commune suffers at least one severe flood that damages crops and houses heavily. And women are often the most affected. However, things are starting to change.\u201cThanks to good preparation and detailed mapping that we developed in the meetings before each storm, nobody in the village was killed or injured severely in the last year storm season. Crops, fowl, and cattle were saved,\u201d explains Ranh, now an official member of the Committee for Flood and Storm Control in her commune.Prior to the project, there were few women on the Committees for Flood and Storm Control (CFSC) in the village. Through the training of women in disaster management, as well as national lobbying\u2014supported by UN Women, UNDP and other stakeholders\u2014the contribution of women has been recognized. A government decree issued in September 2013 now provides an official space for the Women\u2019s Union in decision-making boards of the CFSC at all levels.\u201cAfter being involved in the project, I am more aware of the situation of climate change and its impacts on us. Last year, we participated in the training and exchanged experiences with other women. We prepared better for our families and our village before the storm came,\u201d Ranh said. She said that she talked to the other members of the communal committee for flood and storm control. As a result, before the flooding began, they had plans ready to evacuate people living in lowland areas and near the river.\u201cThe mapping we did together in the training was really helpful. We discussed how to encourage people to harvest earlier, before the storm season started.\u201d In the end, she said, no lives were lost.Last year, a four-year-old boy was saved from drowning because his mother performed CPR on him. She and another 120 women and girls learned this technique from the Rescue and First Aid training provided by the project.\u201cI could not swim before and used to be frightened by the flooded river. But now I am no longer afraid of water thanks to the swimming classes. I will teach my children how to swim and tell other people to learn how to swim too,\u201d Ranh said.This project continues to be implemented in four new provinces including Thua Thien Hue, Quang Binh, Ca Mau and Dong Thap, all of which face a high risk of flooding.This project is financed through core funding to UN Women and from the Government of Luxemburg.Source:UN Women, 2014.\u2022\nUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). UNITAR was created to provide training and research within the UN system with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of all UN programs. In recent years, more of these efforts have focused on the four phases of disaster management, addressing many related topics such as climate change, hazardous materials and pollution, land use, and biodiversity.\n",

The HFA Monitor is an online reporting system that nations and regional organizations use to assess their capabilities and progress according to the indicators outlined in the HFA. The HFA Monitor Template, found on the HFA Monitor website, defines the areas of assessment. The result of this process is a national or regional HFA Progress Report. Not all countries produce the reports, and for those that do, reports are not necessarily submitted for each reporting period. Critics note that it is a self-reporting and ranking system, but in the absence of any other system on the scale of the HFA Monitor, the information it provides is highly informative and very useful in estimating capacity. The information is also used to produce papers and reports on various thematic issues, such as gender in disaster management, integration of DRR and climate change adaptation, early warning, and others.",

In recent years, NATO has assisted flood-devastated Albania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine, supported the UNHCR in Kosovo, sent aid to earthquake-stricken Turkey, helped to fight fires in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Portugal, supported flood response in Pakistan, and supported Ukraine and Moldova after extreme weather conditions destroyed power transmission capabilities. NATO has taken an active role in the response to the 2005 South Asia earthquake, as described in exhibit 10.12\n. NATO also regularly conducts civil emergency planning exercises.Exhibit 10.12NATO Response to the 2005 Earthquake in PakistanThe devastating October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan is estimated to have killed 80,000 people and left up to three million without food or shelter just before the onset of the harsh Himalayan winter. On October 11, 2005, in response to a request from Pakistan, NATO launched an operation to assist in the urgent relief effort.NATO airlifted supplies donated by NATO member and partner countries as well as the UNHCR via two air bridges from Germany and Turkey; 168 flights delivered almost 3,500 tons of relief supplies. The supplies provided included thousands of tents, stoves, and blankets necessary to protect the survivors from the cold. In addition, NATO deployed engineers and medical units from the NATO Response Force to assist in the relief effort. The first teams arrived on October 29, 2005.In just three months of operations, NATO achieved the following:\u2022NATO\u2019s air bridges flew almost 3500 tons of aid to Pakistan with 168 flights. These flights carried in nearly 18,000 tents, 505,000 blankets, nearly 17,000 stoves/heaters, more than 31,500 mattresses, 49,800 sleeping bags, tons of medical supplies, and more.\u2022NATO\u2019s field hospital treated approximately 4,890 patients and conducted 160 major surgeries. Mobile medical units treated approximately 3,424 patients in the remote mountain villages; they also contributed significantly to the WHO immunization program that has helped to prevent the outbreak of disease.\u2022In the cities of Arja and Bagh, NATO engineers repaired nearly 60 kilometers of roads and removed over 41,500 cubic meters of debris, enabling the flow of aid, commerce, and humanitarian assistance to the inhabitants of the valley. Nine school and health structures were completed and 13 tent schools erected. The engineers distributed 267 cubic meters of drinking water and upgraded a permanent spring water distribution and storage system to serve up to 8,400 persons per day.\u2022NATO engineers also supported the Pakistani Army in Operation Winter Race, by constructing 110 multipurpose shelters for the population living in the mountains.\u2022NATO helicopters transported more than 1,750 tons of relief goods to remote mountain villages and evacuated over 7,650 disaster victims.\u2022NATO set up an aviation fuel farm in Abbottabad, which carried out some 1,000 refueling missions for civilian and military helicopters.\nDuring the mission some 1,000 engineers and supporting staff, as well as 200 medical personnel, worked in Pakistan.NATO was part of a very large effort aimed at providing disaster relief in Pakistan. The Pakistani Army provided the bulk of the response, with the support of NATO, the UN, and other international organizations and several individual countries.The Evolution of NATO\u2019s AssistanceOn October 10, NATO received from Pakistan a request for assistance in dealing with the aftermath of the 8 October earthquake. The next day, the North Atlantic Council approved a major air operation to bring supplies from NATO and Partner countries to Pakistan.The airlift began on 13 October and the first tons of supplies arrived in Pakistan on 14 October. On 19 October, NATO opened a second air bridge from Incirlik, Turkey, to deliver large quantities of tents, blankets, and stoves donated by the UNHCR.On 21 October, in response to a further request from Pakistan, NATO agreed to deploy engineers and medical personnel from the NATO Response Force to Pakistan to further assist in the relief effort. A NATO headquarters was deployed to Pakistan on 24 October to liaise with Pakistani authorities and pave the way for the incoming troops. The first troops, the advance elements of the medical team, began arriving on 29 October, and immediately began treating hundreds of people a day.Engineering teams followed and began working in the area around Bagh in support of Pakistani efforts to repair roads and build shelters and medical facilities. NATO engineers also supported the Pakistani Army in Operation Winter Race, by constructing multipurpose shelters for the population living in the mountains.On 9 November, NATO opened a sophisticated 60-bed field hospital, which provided a wide range of care including complex surgical procedures. On the same day, heavy-lift transport helicopters assigned to NATO for the operation began flying and delivering supplies to remote mountain villages and evacuating victims. NATO also set up an aviation fuel farm in Abbottabad, which carried out refueling for civilian and military helicopters, which were essential to the relief effort.On 27 October, Additional Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Tariq Osman Hyder addressed a meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, asking for further assistance. He said that NATO could provide continued airlift, funds, logistic and airspace management, mobile fuel tanks, spare parts for helicopters and tactical aircraft, command and control, and winterized tents and sleeping bags. That same day, NATO\u2019s Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center (EADRCC) received an urgent request from the UNHCR for the transport of additional shelter and relief items stored in Turkey to Pakistan before the winter sets in.NATO\u2019s relief mission came to an end, on schedule, on 1 February 2006. NATO\u2019s short-term relief mission was based on the following five elements:1.Coordination of donations from NATO and partner countries through the EADRCC in Brussels;2.The air bridge from Turkey and Germany for the transport of relief goods to Pakistan;3.Five helicopters operating in the earthquake-affected area for the transport of supplies to remote mountain villages and evacuation of victims;4.Medical support with a field hospital and mobile medical teams in the area of Bagh;5.Engineer support operating in the area around Bagh in support of Pakistani efforts for the repair of roads and building of shelters, schools, and medical facilities.\nThe NATO Land Component in Pakistan was led by the Spanish and headquartered in Arja. It included:\u2022A headquarters element in Arja;\u2022Two light engineer units in the Bagh district (one Spanish and one Polish);\u2022An Italian engineer unit with heavy construction equipment;\u2022A unit of British engineers specialized in high-altitude relief work;\u2022A multinational team of medics operating the NATO field hospital, including staff for inpatient and outpatient care, as well as mobile medical teams in the area of Bagh\u2014led by the Dutch Army and including Czech, French, Portuguese, and British personnel;\u2022Four water purification teams (one Spanish, three Lithuanian);\u2022Two civil-military cooperation teams from Slovenia and France.\nThe NATO Air Component in Pakistan came from the French Air Defense and Operation Command and included:\u2022A German helicopter detachment;\u2022A Luxembourg rescue helicopter;\u2022A French ground handling team;\u2022A fuel farm operated by a French unit at Abbottabad.\nThe NATO HQ in Pakistan comprised personnel from NATO\u2019s Joint Force Command Lisbon, augmented by staff from NATO\u2019s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). In total some 1,000 NATO engineers and supporting staff, as well as 200 medical personnel, worked in Pakistan during the operation.Source: NATO, 2010.",

Together these units formed the combined Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO). The acronym is a carryover from a former component of the EU\u2019s response mechanism called the European Community Humanitarian Office. The move effectively integrated these two functions, which, over time, saw duplicative missions. Exhibit 10.13\nis drawn from an EU factsheet describing how the EU responded to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013 using this combined function.\nExhibit 10.13EU Response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, 2013Through its Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the European Commission made available US$40.6 million to help the survivors of the typhoon with food assistance, shelter, water and sanitation, health and nutrition, short-term livelihood support, reconstruction of schools, emergency logistics, and coordination of relief efforts. Within hours after the disaster struck, the European Commission\u2019s experts had been deployed to identify priority needs.The Commission implemented its assistance primarily through the following partner organizations:\u2022The International Organisation for Migration (IOM)\u2022The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)\u2022The World Food Program (WFP)\u2022The Spanish and German Red Cross\u2022The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)\u2022Two NGO consortia led by Save the Children and PLAN International.\nAssistance supported by ECHO reached approximately 1.2 victims in the areas affected by the typhoon. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated to ensure coordination of European relief efforts. Participating member states supplied personnel and material to support the operation. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism, coordinated by the Commission\u2019s Emergency Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC), also supported the transport of civil protection assets to the region with around US$4.9 million.In addition to humanitarian funds, the European Commission has released $13.5 million from the EU\u2019s development funds to help rebuild people\u2019s lives by assisting in recovery and rehabilitation.Examples of EU-funded humanitarian projects are described in the following section.\u2022To address food insecurity among the affected population who had little to eat and little to no access to markets, the EU funded the efforts of the World Food Programme (WFP). WFP provided general distribution of food, including high-energy biscuits during the emergency phase, and then provided supplementary feeding for children and pregnant and lactating women. \u201cFood-for-work\u201d and \u201ccash-for-work\u201d initiatives were established.\u2022The EU provided funds to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and national Red Cross societies to provide thousands of families with shelter repair kits and to support the livelihoods recovery and WASH clusters. The national Red Cross societies projects supported the delivery of non-food items, including blankets and water storage containers. Many families were provided with unconditional cash grants, and communities were given assistance in improving sanitation facilities, restoring primary healthcare services (including medicines), disease prevention, and hygiene awareness.\u2022The EU supported a consortium that includes Plan International and OXFAM. Funding helped to provide relief for the most significantly affected households by enabling livelihoods recovery, distribution of cash-for-work vouchers, and rehabilitation of public service infrastructure, including child-friendly spaces, classrooms, day care centers, and health stations.\u2022To help the approximately 4 million people left homeless by the typhoon, the EU funded the International Organization for Migration (IOM) efforts to improve the well-being and living conditions of those who were displaced, who have returned, or who are planning to go back to their places of origin. Special attention was given to persons with disabilities and other special needs. The project provided shelter repair kits to the affected populations and ensured quality management of displacement sites and timely information on communities\u2019 return and relocation processes. Finally, vulnerable groups targeted by the initiative received health services, psychosocial support, and non-food items such as blankets.\nBased on: EC, 2014.",

OSDE implemented the disaster mitigation capacity-building component of the project, under the title Post-Georges Disaster Mitigation (PGDM). The PGDM included four primary objectives:\u2022Develop national hazard mitigation policies and plans\u2022Strengthen building practices\u2022Strengthen national emergency shelter policies and programs\u2022Support public information programs on hazard mitigation\n\u2022The OAS and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency created the Caribbean Hazard Mitigation Capacity Building Program. The three-year program assisted countries in the Caribbean region to develop comprehensive, national hazard vulnerability reduction policies and associated implementation programs, and develop and implement safer-building training and certificate programs.\u2022The National Research and Development Foundation created the Hurricane-Resistant Home Improvement Program with assistance from OAS to offer hurricane-resistant home improvement options to low-income families. This program trains local builders in safer construction, offers small loans to families wishing to upgrade their homes, and provides the services of a trained building inspector who approves materials to be purchased and checks minimum standards.\n",

In addition, World Bank projects that have not yet been approved but are in the application process can be redesigned to account for changes caused by the disaster.Exhibit 10.14World Bank Disaster Assistance to Bosnia and HerzegovinaWASHINGTON, June 30, 2014 \u2013 The World Bank Group\u2019s Board of Executive Directors today approved a US$100 million credit for the Floods Emergency Recovery Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), to meet critical needs and restore the functionality of infrastructure essential for public services and economic recovery in affected areas in the aftermath of the worst flooding to hit the country in documented history. The project was prepared in record time in view of the dire situation in the country and will be financed from the International Development Association\u2019s (IDA) Crisis Response Window resources.This project will target areas that were hit hardest by the devastating floods. Preliminary evidence shows that the largest impact from this disaster was on livelihoods, housing, transport, agriculture, and energy. Given the magnitude of the damage caused by flooding and subsequent landslides, the project is designed to support efforts by local and entity governments to quickly re-establish public services to pre-flood levels. The project will also support the Government\u2019s on-going economic recovery initiatives, in particular in the agriculture sector.In addition to this project, the World Bank is working on several other fronts to ensure the provision of a comprehensive package of support for BiH as it recovers and rebuilds from the physical and economic devastation. Notably, the Bank is participating in a systematic recovery needs assessment, led by the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities and supported also by the European Union and the United Nations. The assessment will provide a basis for developing effective rehabilitation measures for infrastructure and services in the affected areas. The World Bank is also considering the restructuring of existing projects in its BiH portfolio to meet reconstruction needs.While immediate recovery needs are the top priority of this project, the World Bank also stands ready to work with the BiH authorities to scale-up flood protection and implement early warning systems. The recently approved Drina Flood Protection Project is a good example of the type of work that could be scaled-up, as it addresses the need to prevent future flooding.As emphasized by Laura Tuck, World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, \u201cThe Floods Emergency Recovery Project will finance critical goods, such as fuel and electricity imports, as well as the reconstruction of local infrastructure. This immediate response, combined with the Drina River Flood Protection Project, will support economic recovery in the affected areas, and will help restore Bosnia and Herzegovina to a growth path following the floods.\u201dThe World Bank portfolio of active projects in BiH now includes 14 operations totaling approximately US$578.6 million. Areas of support include agriculture, environment, energy efficiency, health, social safety and employment, local infrastructure, and private sector development.Source:World Bank Press Release, 2014.",

The vast majority of the ADB emergency loan services during this period were provided in response to natural disaster events, with the remaining dedicated to post-conflict situations. These loans rarely averaged more than 6 percent of the total annual lending by ADB and were concentrated primarily in South Asia. (See exhibit 10.15\nfor a discussion of the ADB\u2019s response to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.)Exhibit 10.15Emergency Loan Request from China Following the May 12, 2008, Wenchuan EarthquakeLoan Sector: Transport, educationProject DescriptionThe Project comprises two components: (i) reconstruction and upgrading of damaged roads and bridges in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and (ii) reconstruction and improvements of damaged schools in Shaanxi Province. The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 368 high-priority earthquake-damaged roads in the 19 worst affected counties of Sichuan Province and 10 subprojects in the four worst affected counties of Shaanxi Province. The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 12 high-priority earthquake-damaged education facilities in the three worst affected counties in Shaanxi Province. These components are designed to be mutually supporting in achieving the overall objective of restoring the affected communities\u2019 access to infrastructure to pre-earthquake levels, and ensuring restored infrastructure is in strict compliance with the latest seismic code.RationaleBased on the government\u2019s damage and needs assessment and the request of the PRC Government, the project identifies specific sectors that require emergency assistance in two of the worst earthquake-affected provinces (i.e., Sichuan and Shaanxi). The project seeks to (i) build on the immediate relief provided by the Government in the earthquake-affected provinces; (ii) contribute to coordinated rehabilitation and reconstruction by different development partners and the government; and (iii) specifically address sustainable recovery priorities by providing indirect livelihood support through public infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction, which generates public employment and underpins the restoration of livelihood activities by rehabilitating roads, bridges, and schools. The project design draws on the ADB experience in delivering emergency assistance acquired in different developing member countries over the past two decades, and complements relief and other rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance provided by the government, United Nations agencies, NGOs, bilateral development partners, and the World Bank. By meeting the earthquake reconstruction needs of the next three years, the project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004). The Project supports the State Overall Plan for Post-Wenchuan Earthquake Restoration and Reconstruction approved by the Government on 19 September 2008.Impact and OutcomeThe impact of the project is accelerated restoration of education and transport infrastructure in earthquake-affected areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. The project will support the government\u2019s efforts to (i) restore the livelihoods and economic activities of the affected population; (ii) accelerate poverty alleviation in the earthquake-affected counties, many of which have a high incidence of poverty; and (iii) rehabilitate and reconstruct public and community-based infrastructure that is vulnerable to natural disasters. The outcome of the project is restoration of people\u2019s access to transport and education infrastructure to preearthquake levels in 19 counties of Sichuan and four counties of Shaanxi provinces.Project Investment PlanThe total project cost is estimated at $441.6 million equivalent.Financing PlanA loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a grace period of 8 years with a maturity period of 32 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.Period of UtilizationUntil June 30, 2012.Estimated Project Completion DateDecember 31, 2011.Implementation ArrangementsAs the project is for emergency assistance, implementation will start immediately after approval and be completed within 36 months.Executing AgencySichuan Provincial Communications Department in Sichuan Province; and Hanzhong city government and Baoji city government in Shaanxi ProvinceImplementing AgenciesSichuan Highway Administration Bureau in Sichuan Province; and county-level highway administration bureaus for roads and bridges, and county-level education bureaus for schools in Shaanxi Province.Project Benefits and BeneficiariesThe project will bring benefits to the project area by (i) reconstructing and improving road conditions and accessibility in townships and in villages in the Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, (ii) reconstructing and improving 12 schools in Shaanxi Province, and (iii) creating local employment opportunities from project construction and related activities. The project will provide equal benefits to females and males.The economic benefits of the rural roads and bridges include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs as a result of improved traffic and road conditions, (ii) time-savings for rural road users, (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents, and (iv) economic benefits from generated traffic. The reconstruction and upgrading of rural roads in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces will benefit about 5.6 million people, three-quarters of whom are rural and one-third of whom are poor. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash crop farming in remote or isolated areas will be stimulated and access to off-farm employment opportunities will be broadened.The project will focus on reconstruction of and improvements to 12 model schools to appropriate design standards, including six junior secondary and six primary schools. This will bring immediate benefits to the schools\u2019 16,600 students (including more than 8000 female students), and long-term benefits to future students drawn from the 460,000 residents of the areas serviced by the schools, about 40% of whom are from rural areas of remote counties. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to rebuild the economy, rehabilitate public infrastructure and utilities, reinstate seismic code compliance, and generate employment. The rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged schools will enable education services to be restored and will offer long-term benefits for affected persons by supporting opportunities for employment and participation in economic activities.Source:ADB, 2009.",
