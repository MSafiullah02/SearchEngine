            "text": "Twenty-five years ago, in the pages of this journal, David C. Thomasma and Edmund D. Pellegrino challenged the field by arguing that medical ethics must begin with the philosophy of medicine. 1 Before his untimely death, Dave let us know that such a comprehensive philosophy of medicine -one that could serve as a foundation for medical ethics -still eluded us. Perhaps, he seemed to suggest, it had only become more difficult to achieve. In 1997, he wrote, practice of medicine today, the movement back towards foundations will be difficult indeed. 2 In this essay, dedicated to David's memory, I would like to set forth a possible new direction for pursuing this challenge. As he noted, such an endeavor amounts to swimming upstream against the currents of contemporary ''bioethics.'' Despite the difficulties, however, it would appear that substantial new work in analytic philosophy might (surprisingly) lead to the sort of foundation for the philosophy of medicine and medical ethics that David sought. The notion of natural kinds has become very important in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy, but scholars have not yet taken seriously how the notion that human beings are a natural kind might have implications for the philosophy of medicine and medical ethics. I will not attempt to lay out all of the implications of this idea in a single essay. Rather, I will attempt to explain the notion of a natural kind, and to outline some of the ways in which this notion might help to illuminate a few fundamental questions about disease and health care. In the long run, a philosophy of medicine based centrally upon the notion of the human as a natural kind might be exactly the sort of foundation for medical ethics that David Thomasma sought.",

The philosophy of medicine has also largely discarded essentialism as a sort of lingering, outmoded Aristotelian habit of speech, or as Jensen has written, ''the child of a static (pre-Darwinian) view of nature.'' 3 Jensen goes on to say that, ''A unit of classification is a human construct,'' and argues that since diseases are evolving entities, they cannot be assigned essences, which are necessarily static. 4 The idea that all classifications are human constructs is not new. It traces its origins to 13th century nominalism. But mere nominalism is not radical enough for the 21st century. For the post-modern bioethicist, medical terms are all socially constructed and thus, little more than disguised attempts to assert power and domination over others. Thus, one group of postmodern feminists has critiqued the research agenda in women's health, writing that the concept to which the word 'woman' refers is '''crowded with the overdeterminations of male supremacy,' and... contaminated with misogyny and sexism.'' 5 They argue further that 'gender' and 'sex' are also tainted with essentialism.",

Since it is impossible to be both inside culture and outside it at the same time, sexual differences are always already informed by gender. Poststructuralist critiques have demonstrated that women's bodies and their experiences are only knowable through the discourses that constitute them, so both sex and gender are socially constructed. 6 Nonetheless, to advance their own political agenda of claiming power for women and righting past injustices, they advocate a cynical appropriation of the essentialist terms 'woman', 'sex', and 'gender' as tools for their movement.",

In this formulation, essentialist categories such as woman/women, sex, or gender are used strategically to achieve specific purposes or aims. In Spivak's terms, strategic essentialism is the ''strategic use of a positivist essentialism in a scrupulously visible political interest.'' In this sense, the strategy suits the situation, and the essentialized term (i.e., woman) becomes a mobilizing slogan aimed at specific political ends. 7 In an academic climate such as this, small wonder that Dave Thomasma thought that the movement back to foundationalism would be difficult. And yet, powerful arguments are emerging in recent analytic philosophy that are making the concept of essentialism not only respectable once again, but even changing the antiessentialist received view.",

He has used the term ''rigid designator'' to describe what might in an earlier era have been called an essential characteristic of a thing. A rigid designator is ''a term that designates the same object in all possible worlds.'' He does not imply that the thing must exist, of necessity, in all possible worlds, but rather that if it were to exist in any possible world, the rigid designator would designate it in that world. This is not trivial or obscure in its consequences for medical ethics. Every time, for instance, that one requests a substituted judgment, the question is framed as a contrary to fact conditional that posits a possible world that is not our own. A clinician asks the daughter of a comatose patient, ''What would your mother, Mrs. Penelope Smith, have wanted in terms of life sustaining treatment if she were able to speak to us today?'' Kripke would insist that the Mrs. Penelope Smith to whom we refer in the possible world in which comatose people's thoughts can be understood is not some other person who happens to look like Mrs. Penelope Smith, but is identical with the Mrs. Penelope Smith lying in the bed in the ICU. It is this woman's values we are after.",

He has come to the conclusion that the predicate calculus simply cannot account for much of what is (particularly living things) unless it is enriched by the addition of the concept of a sortal predicate. 12 In other words, one cannot say ''Smith is the same man I saw yesterday'' without predicating that Smith and the man I saw yesterday belong to the same natural kind (in this case, man). And if this is the case, then Wiggins says, we must embrace at least a ''modest'' form of essentialism. These essences are not Platonic forms. As Wiggins puts it, essences are not ''fancied vacuities parading in the shadow of familiar things as the ultimate explanation of everything that happens in the world. They are the natures whose possession by their owners is the precondition of their owners being divided from rest of reality as anything at all.'' 13 With respect to the philosophy and ethics of medicine, one would think it obvious that at least this sort of modified essentialism would be necessary in order to function in the clinical world. But while this might be obvious to clinicians, it has not been obvious to philosophers. How might the concept of natural kinds bridge the gap between the common sense essentialism of clinicians and the philosophy of medicine? Building on the work of Putnam, Wiggins very clearly, if densely, tells what a natural kind entails:",

And amazingly enough, the average man or woman (or even child), is easily able to tell which entities belong to this natural kind (and their sex), in the absence of technical anatomical knowledge and without reference to a political agenda. One can also readily recognize those deviations from the characteristic development and typical history that render some members of this natural kind defective. So, children born with syndactyly (webbed fingers) are defective members of the human natural kind. They are not members of some other natural kind, say dolphins.

These properties, those that can only be understood in relation to the hierarchical level of organization to which they belong, are said to be ''emergent.''

One cannot understand this disease without also understanding the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the ecological concept of inclusive fit, population genetics, patterns of migration, the physiology of blood flow, the existence of capillaries, the biology of pain, and the concept of infarction, none of which can be fully reduced to chemistry.

But if a pattern of disturbance in the law-like biological principles that determine the characteristic development and typical history of a living natural kind is to be called a disease, at least some individuals with the disease must be inhibited from flourishing as the kinds of things that they are. For example, prostate cancer at age 80 may be ''incidental'' and never interfere with a man's flourishing. But unless prostate cancer interfered with at least some men's flourishing, it would not be called a disease. G. The telos in this definition is that the individual should flourish as the kind of thing that it is. This is an important difference from Christopher Boorse's specification of the telos in his definition of disease as survival and reproduction. 20 Survival and reproduction might be sufficient for an amoeba to flourish as the kind of thing that it is. But survival is scarcely enough for a rosemary bush, never mind a human being. A rosemary bush might survive a bout of powdery mildew, live a normal lifespan, and reproduce well. But while infected, it is not flourishing as a rosemary bush. Likewise, a human being with a coronavirus infection has a disease (the common cold). It is almost inconceivable that this could affect her survival or reproduction. But while infected, she fails to flourish as the kind of thing she is. H. Setting as the telos the flourishing of the individual as the kind of thing that it is also explains why it can be controversial to classify as diseases certain patterns of variation in the law-like biological principles that determine the characteristic development and typical history of a living natural kind. In particular, patterns of human behavior are most susceptible to being controversially called diseases. But this does not undermine the definition of a disease. It is only to say that the task of deciding whether to designate as disease a pattern of variation in the lawlike principles that govern a thing as a member of a kind will have some very clear cases. 21 By virtue of being the kinds of things that they are, human beings are incredibly varied -biologically, psychologically, and socially. Human beings make choices, some of which preclude one good in order to pursue another. There is, therefore, a subject-relativity to the flourishing of human beings that ought not be confused with subjectivity. 22 Thus, human flourishing includes a certain diversity, and this diversity is objectively good. While the purpose of this essay is not to engage in a discussion of medical ethics, it must be stated that this diversity is not morally unbounded. Human choices ought not detract from the common good (as integrally understood) 23 and ought not undermine the basic conditions by which human beings flourish as the kinds of things that they are. 24 ",

In sum, I hold that these three words designate three ways of referring to the same state of affairs -individually, socially, and scientifically -corresponding to the terms sickness, illness, and disease, respectively. Sickness and illness are not the same as disease. 26 Distinctions between these terms have phenomenological and sociological meaning for human beings. While the first two terms, in particular, are largely synonymous in ordinary language, they can be used as technical terms to stipulate different phenomenological and sociological aspects of the lived experience of diseased human beings. Sickness, as I use the term, is a state of disturbed internal biological relations that appears (from a non-professional perspective) to be inhibiting the individual from flourishing as the kind of thing that it is. Individual members of any living natural kind, whether a rosemary bush or a fruit fly, can be said to be sick. Generally, this disturbed state has observable manifestations, but not always. To know that an individual member of a kind is sick, one can observe the pattern of disturbance, and, with at least some knowledge of what it takes for such a kind of thing to flourish, one can make the judgment that the individual is sick. If a crow is walking around in clockwise circles and is not flying, not flapping its wings, not eating, and not cawing, most adult North American observers who know enough about what a crow is and how it typically behaves can make the judgment that the bird is sick. One can also ask for a report (from an individual capable of so reporting) about abnormal sensations or other subjective indications of disturbed biology associated with diminished flourishing. Before one hears a report from the individual, however, one can make one's own judgment and simply ask for confirmation, saying, ''You look as if you are sick.''",

In a rational, self-reflective, and socially interdependent natural kind such as the human, the individual, subjectively appreciated state that I have called sickness must generally be validated by other member(s) of the kind, thus allowing the ill individual to assume ''the sick role.'' 27 Disease serves as an explanatory designation for the same state of affairs. This individual's sickness, the illness that has been ''going around,'' is explained by judging that the individual suffers from a disease, e.g., influenza.

Those who offer putative counter-examples, such as the 19th century medical theory that a slave's habitual tendency to try to escape was a disease (''drapetomania''), 32 do not in any way thereby provide the slightest bit of proof that disease is a ''value-judgment.'' The objective basis for deciding this matter is to ask whether a desire no longer to be a slave is a disturbance in the internal biological relations that inhibits afflicted members of the human natural kind from flourishing as the kinds of things they are. If someone once thought this was true of slaves who wanted to escape, this opinion is simply wrong on both counts. It might be understandable that someone would render such an erroneous opinion given the socioeconomic and historical conditions under which physicians who made such judgments lived.

That explanation made epidemiological sense, and it ultimately fit with the causes of malaria as presently under-stood -Anopheles mosquitoes, carriers of the malarial parasites, breed where the air is ''bad.'' Doubtless our future understanding of malaria will deepen further than our understanding today. But the ''mal'aria'' of medieval Italy and the disease we know today are not two different diseases. They are the same disease, better understood.

For example, the medical community once judged that a diagnosis of the condition known as Lyme Disease required manifestations of an oligoarthritis. As more research was conducted, it was noted that oligoarthritis was one stage in this disease, and that earlier stages had different manifestations such as an erythema migrans rash.

Mistakes are possible at multiple levels. First one must correctly interpret the observable signs and the communicated symptoms (history and physical). Second, one must be knowledgeable about the patterns of signs and symptoms manifested by the diseases as they are classified by the medical science of one's era (differential diagnosis). Third, one must be knowledgeable about the appropriate confirmatory tests (diagnostic testing), and sufficiently experienced to use only those that are necessary (diagnostic elegance). Fourth, in the setting of uncertainty, one must avoid the extremes of rashness (making a diagnosis before there are sufficient data) and indecisiveness (deferring judgment when sufficient data are at hand). The art of medicine is the mediation between medical science (concerned with universals) and the individual who must be diagnosed and treated. Diagnosis is a judgment about individuals. As Aristotle has said, The doctor does not cure 'a man' universally taken, except accidentally, but Callias or Socrates or someone else to whom also the essence of man happens to belong. If, then, someone without the experience has the theory and knows the universal but is ignorant of the individual included under this universal, he will often fail to cure; for it is rather the individual that is curable. (Metaphysics 981a 18-25) . 34 The fact that one can be mistaken in applying the science of one's era in making a judgment about whether a particular disease name can be correctly applied to a particular pattern of disturbance in the internal biological relations of an individual member of the human natural kind does not imply that diseases are value judgments. The logic of diagnosis is intensional. The ultimate standard for whether or not one has correctly applied the disease name (as defined by the science of one's day) to a particular patient is the match between that definition and the state of affairs that actually exists in the affected individual member of the human natural kind who is being diagnosed.",

Whatever definition one gives will exclude some cases and include others, because this is what a definition does. Giving intensional definitions for ontologically real entities is an inherently fallible enterprise. In a definition of multiple myeloma, for instance, one must arrive at cutoff values, currently set at >30% plasma cells in the bone marrow and >3.5 gms/dl of an IgG M-protein. 35 As every experienced clinician knows, some individuals who do not meet these criteria actually have multiple myeloma. However, this only means that the reality to which the definition points is prior to the definition. The definition is open to revision, based on its ability to correctly classify cases as belonging to the recurring pattern of disturbance in internal biological relations of the human natural kind that the definition is attempting to capture. There will be mistakes. Some cases will only come to be knowable as the pattern of disturbance in the individual progresses along its own natural history. There will also be borderline cases in which the diagnostic judgment will be difficult.
