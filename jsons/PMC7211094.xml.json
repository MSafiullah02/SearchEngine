As a rough indication of the risk to family members, consider a \u2018frontline\u2019 nurse who shares a home with his 80-year-old father. There could be as much as a 3% chance of passing on a fatal infection (ie, a 20% chance of the HCW being infected at work and a 15% chance infection is fatal in the father\u2019s age group). This risk to family can be decreased if the HCW takes careful measures not to pass on the infection in the home but, given that people are infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms, only highly burdensome measures will be effective.

For risk to be implicitly consented to, it must be inherent to the role. A physician specialised in the treatment of infectious disease, for example, could reasonably be thought to have implicitly consented to more risk of infection but not something unrelated like risk of assault. This means that each HCW\u2019s duty to treat involves different risks and burdens depending on the characteristics of their role. However, since all HCW\u2019s roles inherently involve the delivery of good care, there is an obligation to deliver that care in a range of adverse circumstances, including circumstances that involve some risk of infection and some burden to protect one\u2019s family from infection. Those HCW roles that inherently involve treating infectious disease oblige workers in those roles to take some further risk of infection and to bear a greater burden to protect their families from infection than HCWs not in such roles.",

In exchange for these benefits, workers have a duty to treat despite higher risks. The reciprocity argument entails that the strength of the duty to treat is proportional to those benefits. Specialised physicians receive substantial benefits so have a very strong duty to treat. Towards the other end of the scale, social care workers receive substantially less from society than physicians and nurses, so their duty to treat is much weaker. Ideally, the role expectations that HCWs implicitly consent to would be justified in light of the benefits society provides and we can see that this is roughly true\u2014society expects more of physicians than nurses, and much more of both physicians and nurses than social care workers.\n3\n\n",

HCWs have a fiduciary relationship with their patients which entails an obligation to work harder to prevent negligent harm to their patients than to strangers.

            "text": "Outside of epidemics, HCWs typically manage to fulfil both their duty to treat and their duty to protect their family members from infection. The conditions created by an epidemic, however, make this unusually challenging and, in some circumstances, the burden of protecting one\u2019s family overrides the duty to treat. To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that the measures taken by the Irish nurse above\u2014separating a room in the home for her exclusive use and keeping six feet away from her family at all times\u2014are required for any \u2018frontline\u2019 HCW to meet their obligation to close family at home. Does the strength of the HCW\u2019s duty to treat oblige her to take on that burden along with the other personal risks and burdens detailed above? My intuition is that it does for those with a strong duty to treat, such as physicians and nurses. Although I expect that some won\u2019t share this intuition and this case might fall into the large grey area created by uncertainty over the exact strength of the duty to treat. I think it is less controversial, however, to claim that HCWs with a weak duty to treat are not obliged to take on such a burden to protect their families. Social care workers, for example, can plausibly argue that, since society doesn\u2019t provide them with much in the way of benefits, they are not obliged to take such burdensome measures. If that is correct, then the absentee Australian social care workers were morally permitted to abstain from work after the outbreak of COVID-19 in their workplace.5 This is even more clearly the case for those two workers who reported having to protect immunocompromised family members and so would have to take on an even greater burden to protect them. This line of argument does not, however, justify abandoning people in aged-care homes, as appears to have happened in Spain.9 Even in cases where social care workers are morally permitted to abstain from work to protect family, they are still obliged to inform management so that alternative measures can be taken.",

In cases where the family members are not particularly vulnerable and so are unlikely to be severely harmed, the duty to treat trumps the duty to family and the HCW is morally obliged to work. Conversely, for a HCW in the same situation but with an extremely vulnerable family member at home, the duty to family trumps the duty to treat and the HCW is permitted to abstain from work. But in both kinds of case, compensation is owed for the duty violated. In the first kind of case, public healthcare has benefitted at the expense of the HCW\u2019s family so fairness requires society compensate the family, perhaps with prioritised healthcare. In the second kind of case, the HCW has been relieved of the excessive burden of protecting a vulnerable family member at the expense of public healthcare, so fairness requires the HCW compensate society, perhaps financially or with free labour after the epidemic.",

This is especially the case with COVID-19 which poses significantly more risk to elderly family members than HCWs themselves.
