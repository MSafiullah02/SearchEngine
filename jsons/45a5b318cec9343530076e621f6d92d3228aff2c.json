The WHO (World Health Organization) estimates the worldwide number of people affected by malaria with about 198 million and 1,200,000 deaths (2013). The Plasmodium parasites need temperatures above 20 \u00b0C in order to complete the entire growth cycle. Therefore, malaria occurs in some places only seasonal. Additionally, there are differences in Anopheles species regarding the affinity to the host and their local distribution. Some genetic factors are protected against malaria. For example, sickle cell anaemia gives a certain protection against P. falciparum and Duffy negative blood group against P. vivax. It appears that after recurrent malaria infections, the body adapts to the disease. This means that an infection is possible, but the symptoms of malaria seem to be reduced.

It is the only drug that can be used to eliminate hypnozoites, which are the dormant forms of the malaria parasites that occur with P. ovale and P. vivax. Because primaquine causes haemolysis in G-6-PD deficiency, G-6-PD status prior therapy needs to be established. If an eradication with primaquine is required in patients with G-6-PD deficiency, a dose up to 45 mg weekly for 8 weeks, with monitoring for haemolysis, could be considered. In children methaemoglobinaemia can be provoked by giving primaquine. A single dose of primaquine 45 mg for P. falciparum, P malaria and P. knowlesi can be given to sterilise the gametocytes. If malaria caused by P. vivax or P. ovale or co-infection with these parasites is suspected, a 14-day treatment with 15 mg of primaquine twice a day is recommended. Before commencing holidays overseas, medical advice should be given in order to assess the malaria risk of the particular country. In nearly all tropical areas, there is a risk of getting infected with malaria. In some tourist areas, this risk might be small, but infection is still possible. In particular day trips to more remote areas pose a risk. Some areas have malaria outbreaks and therefore should be avoided. In general, mosquito bites should be avoided to minimise the risk of any mosquitoborne infections. Mosquitoes transmitting malaria are mainly active at night, sunrise and sunset. However, mosquito bites are also possible throughout the day. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants and closed shoes cover the skin and provide protection against insect bites. Insect repellent for the skin and clothes offer additional protection. Higher concentrations offer better and longer protection. The protection period of a normal insect repellent lasts usually only 1-2 h. Slow release products can prolong the effect. Mosquitoes avoid air-conditioned rooms. So staying in air conditioned rooms itself provides certain protection. Spraying insecticides in rooms and surroundings can be helpful to repel and minimise the quantities of mosquitoes.
