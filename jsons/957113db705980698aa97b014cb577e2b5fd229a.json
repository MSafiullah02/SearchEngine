The strategic position of Kupffer cells (KC), at the luminal side of the liver sinusoidal endothelium, places them in an ideal position for their main function in the steady state, i.e. fi ltering of the blood that enters the liver from both the portal vein and the hepatic artery (see Fig. 10 .1a, b for a schematic representation). In this manner they play an important role in the surveillance of potentially hazardous substances entering the body via the intestine, as well as in the recycling of iron by the removal of effete erythrocytes from the circulation. In addition to this scavenger function, KC are increasingly recognized as regulatory and effector cells in innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious agents and other conditions challenging liver homeostasis. Interestingly, KC activity also affects hepatocyte function directly, thus making these cells important versatile constituents of the liver.",

Given the ambition of this goal and the space limitations set, we necessarily restrict ourselves to the global picture as obtained from studies in human and in animal models, and refer to more specifi c literature where applicable. Although defi ning KC by their tissue localization and specifi c macrophage features seems clear-cut, distinguishing these cells from other myeloid cells such as circulating monocytes, perivascular macrophages, and different types of dendritic cells sometimes appears problematic. This especially concerns studying populations of cells after isolation and/or in infl ammatory conditions. In different studies, authors apply slightly different criteria for the identifi cation of \"genuine\" KC vs. recent immigrants, and this easily creates confusion. Where possible, we attempt to clarify these semantic issues, but these are important considerations when interpreting experimental fi ndings.",

            "text": "Like various other tissue macrophages, KC have a characteristic amoeboid morphology with lamellipodia and an irregular surface containing many microvilli (Naito et al. 2004 ) . They contain an ovoid or indented nucleus and their numerous cytoplasmic vesicles are reminiscent of a high level of phagocytic and pinocytic activity. Figure 10 .2 provides an overview of histomorphological aspects of KC at different magnifi cation levels. The cells adhere to the fenestrated sinusoidal (d) Surface of rat KC after 5 min of intravenous administration of thorotrast (radioactive thorium dioxide particles). Already after this short period of time particles are adhered to the cell surface and incorporated in (macro)pinocytic vesicles, and a worm-like structure endothelium and are slightly more abundant in the peri-portal than in the peri-central regions. Although KC are the specialized phagocytes of the liver, sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver have signifi cant endocytic capacity, and this historically gave rise to the, now deserted, concept of the reticulo-endothelial system as scavenger system. In fact, early ultrastructural and functional studies were instrumental in establishing a defi nitive distinction between the two cell types (Wisse 1972 ) . Both KC and endothelial cells contain high levels of lysosomal enzymes, such as glycosidases, nucleases, lipases, and proteases, in line with their clearance function. In mouse liver, KC numbers are approximately 35-40 % of the number of hepatocytes (Baratta et al. 2009 ) , and comparable histological pictures in other species suggest very similar frequencies.",

            "text": "With regard to the KC's molecular phenotype, current approaches allow the acquisition of genome-wide information on expressed genes under steady state and experimental or diseased conditions. Ideally, this would provide elaborate phenotypic information for the comparison of KC in different circumstances, or with other cell types. However, the currently available information on KC gene expression profi les is relatively limited. In part this may be related to the demanding isolation procedures, which represent a challenge to achieve reliable gene expression profi les. In the recent comparison of different tissue macrophages by the Immunological Genome Consortium, KC proved elusive for defi nitive identifi cation and/or isolation through sorting by fl owcytometry (Gautier et al. 2012 ) . At the time of writing of this chapter, the publicly accessible repositories (Geo and ArrayExpress) contain only two studies describing data on KC (Gorgani et al. 2008 ; Roudkenar et al. 2008 ). Other publications describe gene expression arrays of KC in various experimental settings, but the authors have not deposited raw data, thus limiting their value for subsequent use by others (Chen et al. 2010 ; Gehring et al. 2009 ; Xu et al. 2012 ; Zocco et al. 2006 ) . In general, these studies strongly confi rm the macrophage identity of KC. Comparison with other resident macrophages, however, also strengthens the profound infl uence of unique local conditions on the expression profi les and related biological functions. In this respect, KC are characterized by the high level expression of various types of receptors involved with endocytosis (Gorgani et al. 2008 ) . Changing environmental conditions, for instance during liver regeneration or interferon treatment also have a signifi cant impact on global gene expression by KC, showing their general responsiveness (Xu et al. 2012 ; Zocco et al. 2006 ) .",

They identifi ed a subpopulation of so-called \"sessile\" KC that was highly underrepresented among the cells isolated using enzymatic digestion.

Kinoshita and collaborators identifi ed by fl owcytometry two major KC subsets in mouse liver, which both are F4/80 + but differentially express CD68 and CD11b (Kinoshita et al. 2010 ). In our own recent histological analysis of mouse KC, we and others observed differential expression of CD68 and F4/80 by KC with only partial overlap (Movita et al. 2012 ; Lloyd et al. 2008 ). In addition, only a minority of F4/80 + KC showed histologically detectable CD11b expression. Careful evaluation let us conclude that F4/80-low CD11b + cells in the liver resemble monocyte-related cells, and differ from tissue-resident KC, with the latter population being more diffi cult to isolate from the liver by perfusion or collagenase treatment (Movita et al. 2012 ; Kinoshita et al. 2010 ). This subset distinction was recently confi rmed, showing that CD68 + cells, but not CD11b + cells, expressed CRIg, MerTK, and CD64, and were involved with systemic bactericidal activities (Ikarashi et al. 2013 ) . In contrast, CD11b + cells were pivotal in immunity against tumors. Clearly, scoring cells positive or negative in immunofl uorescence or immunohistochemistry depends on mul-tiple technical parameters, but the fi ndings at this level illustrate the heterogeneity of KC in the steady state. Whether this represents the existence of distinct subsets or a spectrum of cells with different expression levels remains to be determined.",

These varied from the classic mononuclear phagocyte system view of an exclusive bone marrow (BM) origin, where circulating monocytes differentiate into KC, to an embryonic origin of the KC population, which is maintained via local proliferation. The proliferating cells could be either immature local precursor cells or mature KC themselves. Early studies, for instance, showed extensive mitosis of KC during the regeneration phase after partial hepatectomy (Widmann and Fahimi 1975 ) . However, this could also represent proliferation of immigrants from the circulation. Functional depletion of BM cells by radioactive 89 Sr incorporation into bone strongly suggested the independent maintenance of KC (Yamada et al. 1990 ), but disparate opinions on KC origin existed for a long time in the scientifi c community.",

In these, Crispe and colleagues identifi ed in mice the radio-resistant \"sessile\" KC mentioned above. Four weeks after BM transplantation, approximately half of the KC population appeared to be of donor origin as determined at the histological level. In seeming contrast, fl owcytometric analysis showed 99 % of F4/80-high, CD11b-low KC were donor-derived at this time point. This discrepancy could be explained by the presence of sessile KC, which are barely replaced and escape enzymatic isolation, and therefore fl owcytometric identifi cation. The sessile population was, however, completely depleted by in vivo treatment with liposome-encapsulated clodronate, and then replaced by donor-type cells. Thus, sessile KC could be either self-maintained or have acquired radioresistance and longevity, and still be hematogenous in origin. The experimental conditions, however, signifi cantly challenge the resident KC population, and thus the obtained results leave room for diverse interpretations concerning the origin of KC in the steady state. In any case, the liposome-mediated depletion experiments gave no indication for the existence of an immature, non-phagocytic local precursor, which would have generated host-type KC. Rather, these experiments showed the potential of BM-derived cells to differentiate into genuine KC.",

Activity of the alternative ligand for CSF-1 receptor, IL-34, probably explains the generation of these residual KC. Absence of only IL-34, in turn, does not affect KC development, in contrast to generation of epidermal Langerhans cells and microglia . The notion that CSF-1 is an important growth factor for KC is supported by the fi nding that KC fail to repopulate in adult CSF-1-defi cient but IL-34-suffi cient op/op mice after liposomal clodronate-mediated depletion, while KC reach normal numbers after 14 days in CSF-1-suffi cient mice (Yamamoto et al. 2008 ) . Exogenous CSF-1 supplementation restores KC development in op/op mice. Interestingly, it was shown recently that resident macrophage populations, including KC, are stimulated under type infl ammatory type 2 conditions to proliferate in an IL-4-mediated, CSF-1-independent fashion (Jenkins et al. 2013 ) .",

            "text": "Under steady state conditions, in the absence of triggers by pathogens, disease or physical stress, KC fulfi ll an important role to eliminate insoluble macromolecules, immune complexes, toxins, and degenerated cells from the circulation. Since KC reside in the liver sinusoids in large numbers and are adherent to the endothelial cells they are able to sample the blood entering the liver from the gut as well as from the main circulation. Elimination of debris and insoluble macromolecules is via pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as scavenger receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc receptors that are able to bind immune complexes or opsonized cells. Senescent or damaged erythrocytes are removed in the liver by KC, but also by macrophages in spleen and bone marrow. Furthermore, during the lifespan of erythrocytes, part of their hemoglobin content as well as of their membrane is shed as vesicles. These hemoglobin-containing vesicles are rapidly removed from the circulation by liver KC and, to a lesser extent, macrophages from other tissues mainly by scavenger receptors (Willekens et al. 2005 ) . Following phagocytosis and hemolysis, the different components are degraded and recycled. Hemoglobin is degraded by heme-oxygenases (HO), of which HO-1 is expressed in KC. HO-1 is induced by diverse stimuli including heme, heat stress, LPS, and various cytokines. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide, which are all considered to be hepatoprotective at low quantities under steady state conditions. Iron is then either stored intracellularly as ferritin or conveyed to circulating transferrin via membrane-bound ferroportin. Interestingly, it was also shown that hemedegrading HO-1 acts as a downstream effector molecule of IL-10 that mediates its immunosuppressive activities (Lee and Chau 2002 ) .",

The importance of the liver in this respect is indicated by the fi nding that apoptotic neutrophils appeared in the lungs and spleen only after inactivation of KC by gadolinium chloride (Shi et al. 2001 ). Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by KC is mediated by recognition of surface phosphatidylserine and, importantly, enhances the production of IL-10, and may favor a state of unresponsiveness. The induction of IL-10 may prevent development of sterile infl ammation, activation of macrophages, and release of activating signals. Ongoing phagocytosis of apoptotic cells as part of liver homeostasis, in combination with low levels of LPS that are continuously released from the gut are likely responsible for constant low levels of anti-infl ammatory mediators, such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and prostaglandins that restrict infl ammation under steady state conditions. In addition, continuous exposure to serotonin probably contributes to the induction and maintenance of a non-infl ammatory state (de las Casas-Engel et al. 2013 ).",

In addition, using fl owcytometrically sorted cells and in the setting of bile duct ligation-induced liver infl ammation, He et al demonstrated that ED1 + ED2 + KC have a high mRNA level of IL-1\u03b2 (He et al. 2009 ). In a mouse model of ischemia reperfusion, TLR9-mediated activation of the NLRP3 infl ammasome by extracellular histones appeared to play an important role in IL-1 activation and liver damage (Huang et al. 2013 ). However, several other studies show that steady state KC are relatively weak in producing cytokines. In vitro stimulation with LPS, R848, or CpG resulted in very low levels of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12p40 produced by KC (Movita et al. 2012 ) . Similarly, Kinoshita et al.

This so-called endotoxin tolerance to repetitive antigenic stimulation prevents excessive activation of KC and infl ammation of the liver. The state of unresponsiveness is mediated via immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and prostaglandins, and further supported by down-regulation of TLR expression levels and negative regulation of TLR signaling, for instance by IRAK-M (Liu et al. 2008 ) . Active suppression by IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 reduces the antigen-presenting capacity of KC by down-regulating the expression of MHC molecules and co-stimulators, without strongly affecting the scavenger function of KC. The consequence of the immunosuppressive milieu on KC, but also on other potential antigen-presenting cells including dendritic cells and sinus endothelial cells, is allograft tolerance following liver transplantation, but also a limited ability to eliminate intrahepatic pathogens. It has been suggested that, depending on the microenvironment and the quality and strength of signals received by KC, they can become immune-stimulatory cells, as has been demonstrated in co-culture experiments with human NK cells (Tu et al. 2008 ).",

In a mouse model of NAFLD, in which ob/ob mice are fed a high-fat diet, the total number of KC is not affected (Leroux et al. 2012 ). However, the function of KC is altered, since KC in NAFLD secrete higher levels of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and express a so-called \"M1-phenotype,\" which has also been shown for the increased numbers of macrophages present in obese adipose tissue (Lumeng et al. 2007 ). Enhanced secretion of pro-infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 by activated macrophages may lead to more tissue damage. The crucial role of KC in fatty liver disease has been indicated by experiments in mice where KC were eliminated by liposomal clodronate or by gadolinium chloride, which signifi cantly decreased hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (Huang et al. 2010 ; Rivera et al. 2007 ) and was accompanied by lower TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression.",

One of the initiation events of NAFLD is likely an alteration in the intestinal microbiota due to overnutrition or metabolic disturbances. These changes in intestinal microbial profi les affect fat accumulation in the liver. In this respect, it has been shown that ob/ob mice, which are a well-known model for obesity, display a different microbial profi le compared to control mice (Tilg 2010 ) . As a consequence of altered gut microbiota the local as well as systemic levels of endotoxins, such as LPS, may increase and affect innate immune cells, including KC.

Activity of distinct PPAR members have an effect on NAFLD pathogenesis, since PPAR-\u03b3 signaling improves insulin sensitivity and may be benefi cial for NAFLD treatment, whereas lower levels of PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b4 lead to increased fat storage and consequently more severe disease (Stienstra et al. 2010 ) . In this respect, macrophage-specifi c induction of PPAR-\u03b4 signaling stimulates alternative or M2-like activation of KC, which is thought to mediate insulin-sensitizing effects (Odegaard et al. 2008 ). In addition, mediators produced by adipose tissue, such as leptins and other cytokines, may modulate KC function. In this regard, adiponectin may inhibit NK-\u03baB and Erk1/2 signaling and thereby inhibit cytokine induction, whereas leptins induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory cytokines. Similar as in NAFLD, fatty liver disease caused by excessive alcohol consumption also leads to higher endotoxin levels in serum, which is primarily due to changes in the microbial gut fl ora and enhanced intestinal permeability (Thurman et al. 1998 ) . Although the initiating trigger that causes alcoholic liver disease is different from NAFLD, many of the clinical observations and their underlying mechanisms are similar. Ethanol may directly affect the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as PPAR-\u03b1. Similar as in NAFLD, depletion of KC in mice also attenuates alcohol-induced disease, demonstrating a central role for KC (Nath and Szabo 2009 ). In addition, abrogation of the TNF-\u03b1 pathway in vivo using antibodies against TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1RI gene-targeted mice strongly reduces alcohol-induced liver pathology, as demonstrated by reduced serum ALT levels and pathology scores (Iimuro et al. 1997 ; Yin et al. 1999 ) . Interestingly, signaling via TLR4 activates KC in these mouse models, with the TRIF pathway-but not the MyD88 pathway-being responsible for TNF-\u03b1 induction (Hritz et al. 2008 ).",

            "text": "KC form, together with the sinusoidal endothelial cells, the fi rst barrier for pathogens to enter the liver via the portal vein (Vollmar and Menger 2009 ) . Their endocytic capacity, expression of different PRR, MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, and ability to produce cytokines upon stimulation, renders them potent immune cells contributing to either pathogen clearance or persistence. Pathogen recognition may activate KC leading to the production of pro-infl ammatory mediators important for inhibition of pathogen replication, the induction of resistance to infection of neighboring cells, and attraction and activation of other immune cells. KC are the prime cells in the liver to present lipid antigens in a CD1-restricted manner to NKT cells. In conjunction, KC activate NK cells (also called Pit cells, representing the large intrahepatic NK cell population) and NKT cells via the production of pro-infl ammatory cytokines, which on their turn produce activating cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and provide cytotoxic activity (Tu et al. 2008 ; Dao et al. 1998 ) . Although liver macrophages are probably not involved in priming of na\u00efve T cells, mouse KC have been shown to present antigen to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, inducing these to proliferate and produce IFN-\u03b3 (Ebrahimkhani et al. 2011 ; You et al. 2008 ) . The interaction of KC with membranebound as well as soluble mediators expressed by infi ltrating immune cells probably leads to further regulation of KC function and of the intrahepatic infl ammatory response. In contrast to their role as effective host defense cells favoring the survival of the infected host, evidence is accumulating that some pathogens use the transport properties of sinusoidal cells, including KC, to increase the effi ciency of hepatocyte infection. Furthermore, pathogens may exploit the tolerogenic capacities of KC to evade immunity and/or may have evolved to inhibit the immunogenic functions of KC. In the following paragraphs we will provide examples of the various roles of KC in viral, bacterial, and parasitic infection, without the ambition, however, to be elaborate in the discussion on the different pathogens that challenge hepatic homeostasis.",

Failure in direct clearing of viruses resulted in \"spill-over\" infection to hepatocytes, which prolonged the duration of infection and exacerbated immunopathology. Furthermore, the number of intrahepatic F4/80 + cells increased during LCMV infection, suggesting the involvement of KC and/or recruited infl ammatory monocytes in the immune response to LCMV (Dixon et al. 1986 ) and in the regulation of immunopathology (Lang et al. 2010 ) . In mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and adenovirus infection, KC were found to produce pro-infl ammatory cytokines and chemokines, which were directly or indirectly responsible for monocyte, NK cell, and T cell infi ltration in the liver (Salazar-Mather and Hokeness 2006 ; Lieber et al. 1997 ; Liu et al. 2003 ; Zaiss et al. 2002 ) .

So far, it is mostly unclear which receptors KC may use to recognize and take up HBV. Possible candidate receptors for direct binding of HBV to KC are heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), CD14, and the mannose receptor. Another molecule that binds HBsAg avidly is albumin, which is effi ciently taken up by KC as well as hepatocytes, and may offer the virus a physiological transport pathway to parenchymal cells (Wright et al. 1988 ) . Similarly, KC also express several receptors known to be involved in hepatocyte infection by HCV (Ploss and Evans 2012 ) , including HSPG (Pradel et al. 2002 ) , LDL-receptor (Kleinherenbrink-Stins et al. 1991 ; Kamps et al. 1991 ) , SR-B1 (Terpstra and van Berkel 2000 ) , CD81 (Petracca et al. 2000 ) , and DC-SIGN (Tu et al. 2008 ), a lectin known to bind the HCV envelope protein E2 (Pohlmann et al. 2003 ) .

A recent study, investigating the difference between responders and non-responders to IFN-\u03b1 therapy against HCV, showed that non-responders had relatively high expression levels before treatment of IFN-stimulated genes in the liver (Lau et al. 2013 ) . In these patients, KC appeared to be a local source of type 1 IFN that promoted basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes in hepatocytes, and thus negatively infl uenced the outcome of IFN-based therapy.",

TLR2 has been put forward as a possible specifi c recognition receptor for the nucleocapsid protein of HBV, i.e. HBcAg, and the non-particulate version of this protein, HBeAg. Moreover, HBeAg present in the cytosol seems to interfere actively with TLR signaling (Lang et al. 2011 ). TLR2 has also been suggested to play a role in HCV-core and nonstructural-3 protein (NS3) recognition by macrophages leading to MyD88-dependent activation, including increased IRAK activity, p38 phosphorylation, ERK and JNK activity, and AP-1 activation (Imran et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, it was shown that NS3-induced TNF-\u03b1 production by KC is partially TLR4-dependent (Hosomura et al. 2011 ).",

In contrast to HBV and HCV, HAV requires the disruption of host cell membranes to release its progeny.

KC can kill hepatocytes either directly via CD95dependent apoptotic pathways or indirectly by interacting with CD8 + (and possibly CD4 + ) lymphocytes through stimulation of cytokine secretion and other mediators like phospholipases and NO (Polakos et al. 2006 ; Kolios et al. 2006 ).

            "text": "Exclusive infection of the liver by bacteria has not been described, and most bacteria that reach the liver through the blood are effi ciently cleared by immune cells. A major role for KC in host defense against bacterial infection is indicated by several studies in experimental models. Infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes is a well-studied liver infection model. On the one hand, Listeria infection is dependent on KC function, as accumulation of bacteria in the liver depends on recognition of bacterial surface molecules by cognate receptors on KC (Ofek and Sharon 1988 ) . On the other hand, production of infl ammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and NO by infected KC inhibits proliferation of the microorganism (Ehlers et al. 1992 ; Ofek and Sharon 1988 ) . At the same time KC-derived chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4), MCP-1 (CCL2), and MIP-2 (CXCL2 /-3), drive monocyte and neutrophil recruitment into the liver in order to control infection (Salkowski et al. 1998 ; Barsig et al. 1998 ; Ebe et al. 1999 ) . In line with this, LPS treatment prior to infection has been shown to increase KC numbers leading to a reduction of bacterial load and improvement of prognosis in a Salmonella septicemia model (Lehner et al. 2001 ) . Thus, as expected, KC inactivation or depletion results in impaired bacterial clearance (Cousens and Wing 2000 ; Tomioka et al. 2000 ; Pinto et al. 1991 ) . In humans, the increased frequency of septicemia and septic shock involving Gram-negative bacteria in patients with hepatic failure have been attributed to the inability of KC to clear the portal circulation of microorganisms and endotoxin (Wyke 1987 ; Triger and Wright 1973 ) .",

While neutrophils are bactericidal cells par excellence, KC have a limited capacity to kill Listeria , for instance (Tomioka et al. 2000 ) . Several mouse and rat studies demonstrated the presence of apoptotic neutrophils in KC upon bacterial infection or endotoxin exposure (Shi et al. 1996 (Shi et al. , 2001 Gregory et al. 2002 ) . These fi ndings suggest that KC play a critical role in eliminating neutrophils that accumulate in the liver sinusoids subsequent to clearance of bacteria, bacterial endotoxin, and microbial debris from the blood. Furthermore, it was found that neutrophils, accumulated in the liver sinusoids, suppress cytokine and chemokine production by KC, thereby showing an important role for neutrophil-KC interaction in moderating the pro-infl ammatory response to bacteria taken up by the liver (Holub et al. 2009 ).",

Following the delivery of malaria parasites into the skin by a mosquito bite, the rapid migration of sporozoites allows them to escape clearance by local tissue phagocytic cells and to enter lymphatics and blood vessels. Via the blood, sporozoites rapidly reach the liver and, after gliding on HSPG in liver sinusoids, they use circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) to bind to KC (Pradel and Frevert 2001 ) . Interaction with and passage through KC is important for hepatocyte infection (Ishino et al. 2004 ; Baer et al. 2007 ) , indicating that these parasites use KC to overcome the sinusoidal barrier and, ultimately, to infect hepatocytes (Mota et al. 2002 ) . TREM2 expression by KC appears to be an important determinant in resistance to liver stage infection against Plasmodium parasites (Goncalves et al. 2013 ) . Once inside a hepatocyte, the parasites develop into merozoites, which will be released from the liver to infect erythrocytes (Sturm et al. 2006 ) . Taken together, these data show that sporozoites not only use their migratory capacity to escape elimination by phagocytic cells, but also use KC to increase their effi ciency at infecting hepatocytes.",

However, persistent or too intense infl ammatory responses will induce massive death of hepatocytes and hence cause irreversible tissue damage. Chronic infl ammation is the basis of liver fi brosis and cirrhosis and also significantly increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Since KC, as major sentinel cells, contribute signifi cantly to infl ammation and its sequels, they play an important role in the induction and regulation of liver fi brosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Macrophage numbers increase in damaged liver and they are principally located around the regions of damage and fi brosis (Wallace et al. 2008 ) . Inhibition of KC function using gadolinium chloride was found to reduce liver fi brosis in experimental models (Rivera et al. 2001 ) . KC are thought to be involved in fi brogenesis via the production of ROS, cytokines, and growth factors that induce hepatic stellate cell myofibroblastic transformation (Wallace et al. 2008 ). In addition, they not only produce metalloproteinases and their inhibitors but also regulate the production of these factors by other cells, and stimulate their survival, leading to disturbance of the homeostatic mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix deposition (Xidakis et al. 2005 ; Pradere et al. 2013 ) . Recent studies demonstrate that these actions are only partially conducted by liver-resident macrophages, but largely depend on recruitment of Ly6C-expressing monocytes as precursors of tissue macrophages into the infl amed and damaged liver (Imamura et al. 2005 ; Karlmark et al. 2009 ).",

In this context, IL-17A, which has been found elevated in fi brosis associated with alcoholic liver disease, appears to stimulate both KC and stellate cell activation (Hara et al. 2013 ).

Recently, it was demonstrated that the expression of TREM-1 by mouse KC plays a crucial role in their activation upon recognition of necrotic hepatocytes (Wu et al. 2012 ) .

Hepatic metastases result from initial detachment of tumor cells from the primary site, entry into the portal circulation, and entrapment of metastatic cells in the liver sinusoids (Van den Eynden et al. 2013 ). In vivo microscopy has shown that KC are attracted to tumor cells in the hepatic circulation and have the ability to phagocytose these cells (Kan et al. 1995 ) . NO, produced by KC after stimulation with TNF-\u03b1, PG\u0395 2 (Valatas et al. 2004 ; Gaillard et al. 1991 ) , and endotoxin derived from the portal circulation, is thought to be an effective weapon of the KC machinery against tumor cells, since NO is able to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Aono et al. 1994 ; Hussain and Harris 2007 ) . However, NO also mediates tumor-promoting effects that include the ability to induce DNA damage, to increase angiogenesis by inducing VEGF production, to stimulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion, and to suppress anti-tumor immunity (Hussain and Harris 2007 ; Koblish et al. 1998 ). Furthermore, KC are able to produce HGF, which has been shown to contribute to tumor cell proliferation, and KC might facilitate tumor angiogenesis and invasion by secreting proteases, which alter the extracellular matrix in favor of tumor progression (Knittel et al. 1999 ). Moreover, KC may contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment by expressing immune regulatory factors, such as IL-10, PD-L1 in addition to NO, that could prevent an effective immune response towards the tumor (Trinchieri 2012 ) .",

            "text": "Although KC may have ambivalent roles in interaction with tumor cells, the protective role of KC against hepatic metastases has been emphasized by the fi nding that KC depletion prior to tumor cell challenge resulted in a drastic increase in tumor development in the liver (Paschos et al. 2010 ; Kruse et al. 2013 ) . In support of this protective role of KC, isolated KC were found to be cytotoxic against human colon adenocarcinoma cells and this cytotoxicity was increased signifi cantly when KC were stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 and endotoxin (Roh et al. 1990 ; Heuff et al. 1995 ) . Other studies have demonstrated that KC induce Fas expression in colon cancer cells (Song et al. 2001 ) and malignant glioma cells (Lau et al. 2001 ) leading to Fasmediated apoptosis and death in the presence of tumor-infi ltrating lymphocytes or TNF-\u03b1. The opposing tumor-restricting and -promoting role of KC was elegantly modeled recently by depleting KC at different time points during tumor induction (Wen et al. 2013 ) . Depletion prior to tumor transfer facilitated tumor growth, while late stage KC depletion led to decreased tumor mass.",

            "text": "Studies in experimental animal models in particular have indicated that KC and liver-infi ltrating macrophages contribute signifi cantly to homeostasis in health and disease. They perform important tasks in protecting the host against invading pathogens and are thought to play a major role in induction and maintenance of immunological tolerance. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that liver macrophages are essential for the resolution of fi brosis and display anti-tumor activities. However, they are also at least partly responsible for the development of liver diseases, including fatty liver disease, the initiation of various forms of hepatitis and sequellae, like fi brosis. Several microbial pathogens seem to use KC as transport cells to infect the liver. Once liver infection is established and/or liver cell damage has occurred, liver macrophages contribute importantly to the infl ammatory response and further tissue damage by producing pro-infl ammatory and pro-fi brotic mediators, by killing hepatocytes and even by supporting carcinogenesis.",

Moreover, the notion that infi ltrating monocytes readily develop into KC in non-steady state conditions seemingly makes the distinction between \"true\" KC and recent immigrants also a semantic issue. However, resident KC and liver-infi ltrating macrophages probably respond differently to various environmental conditions, given their distinct developmental histories, thus leading to diverse phenotypic and functional states of these cells. It is tempting to speculate that these differences may eventually be essential in the contribution of different liver macrophages to various homeostatic processes. With our growing appreciation of the complex roles of liver macrophages in both protective and harmful responses, these cells form an interesting but diffi cult cellular target for treatment options in liver diseases. Future efforts should therefore focus on identifying the characteristics of the specifi c macrophage subpopulations that exert the distinctive functions of interest and on identifying the underlying mechanisms of actions.",
