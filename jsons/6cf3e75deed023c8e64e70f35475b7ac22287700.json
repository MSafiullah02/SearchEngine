Rapid intervention necessitates the capacity to generate, grow, and genetically manipulate infectious CoVs in order to rapidly evaluate pathogenic mechanisms, host and tissue permissibility, and candidate antiviral therapeutic efficacy. CoVs encode the largest viral RNA genomes at about 28-32,000 nucleotides in length, and thereby complicate efficient engineering of the genome. Deconstructing the genome into manageable fragments affords the plasticity necessary to rapidly introduce targeted genetic changes in parallel and assort mutated fragments while maximizing genome stability over time. In this protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5-7 independent DNA fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the 1960s (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) and were primarily associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections with the potential to progress to a severe respiratory disease in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [1] . Although additional HCoVs were known to circulate at this time, these strains were not culturable; therefore, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections modeled our understanding of CoV disease severity until 2003 [1] . In Southeast Asia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in late 2002 and caused acute respiratory distress syndrome and an age-dependent mortality rate of 10-50%, clearly demonstrating that HCoVs were emerging pathogens with pandemic potential [2] . The portent of a worldwide pandemic mobilized the scientific community, leading to robust public health intervention strategies that controlled the epidemic. Moreover, the outbreak spurred academic interest into CoV gene function and pathogenic mechanisms associated with SARS-CoVinduced disease, leading to the development of therapeutic countermeasures. Because of the availability of reverse genetics, robust in vitro replication, and in vivo animal models of human disease, SARS-CoV has become the most intensively studied prototype for HCoV research [3] . SARS-CoV research prompted the generation of novel animal models that have provided insight into (1) genetic changes in the SARS-CoV genome that modulate respiratory pathogenesis [4] ; (2) the impact of SARS-CoV on host innate and adaptive immune responses [5, 6] ; (3) the role of host genes in regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice [4, 7] ; and (4) novel strategies for the development of vaccines and therapeutic countermeasures [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 296, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 505, "end": 508, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 783, "end": 786, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1347, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1610, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1613, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1690, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1693, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1788, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Two novel HCoVs (NL63 and HKU1) were identified shortly after the emergence of SARS-CoV [8] [9] [10] , and nearly a decade later, in 2012, the world saw the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Fig. 1) . MERS-CoV causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pneumonia-like symptoms, and multi-organ failure, with a case fatality rate of ~36% [11] . Human cases of MERS-CoV have been predominantly observed in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. MERS-CoV-infected individuals have also traveled internationally, illustrating the potential for global spread. For example, a South Korean native returning home from the Middle East in May 2015 initiated an outbreak that infected 186 people, resulting in 20% mortality and a nationwide economic crisis [12] . Transmission of MERS-CoV has been mostly observed among health care workers in the hospital setting. Accumulating evidence indicates that Middle Eastern individuals working in close contact with dromedary camels are at increased risk of acquiring MERS-CoV [13] . Camels are suspected to be intermediate hosts between bats and humans that can repeatedly allow for reemergence of MERS-CoV in the human population. Though camels show only mild symptomology during MERS-CoV infection, zoonotic CoV infections can be highly pathogenic in animals. Demonstrated recently by the emergence of a porcine CoV in the United States, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused severe disruption to the pork industry with the deaths of tens of millions of animals in the first 2 years and a >90% mortality rate [14] (Fig. 1) . PEDV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, and 229E-HCoV are thought to have emerged from a bat reservoir, while OC43-HCoV is thought to have originated among bovine coronaviruses. In 2013 preemergent SARS-like CoVs were identified in horseshoe bats and found to be poised for entry into the human population [15] (Fig. 1) . Importantly, much of the HCoV research over the last 15 years has been possible because of the capacity to generate infectious clones using highly efficient reverse genetics platforms [16] , coupled with robust small animal models of human disease [17, 18] . Reverse genetic systems for coronaviruses were difficult to achieve because of the large size of the viral RNA genome, genome stability in bacterial vectors, difficulty in driving full-length 30 kb RNA transcripts in vitro, poor transfection efficiencies, and low infectivity of the viral genome. In 2000, the first molecular clone was developed for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), using targeted splice junctions to increase genome stability in lowcopy baculovirus vectors [19] (Fig. 1) . A few months later, our group published an alternative TGEV reverse genetic strategy [20] , and then again applied this technique for the group 2 murine coronavirus [21] . A final innovation in CoV molecular clone design was the insertion of full-length HCoV 229E molecular clone into vaccinia virus in 2001 [22] . Each approach has proven to be a potentially powerful system to probe the role of CoV genes in replication and pathogenesis [3, 23, 24] . This review primarily focuses on the reverse genetic strategy developed in the Baric laboratory, a technology that partitions the CoV genome into discrete fragments, and uses class IIS and IIG restriction endonucleases to systematically and seamlessly assemble full-length cDNA genomes of CoVs. After in vitro transcription and transfection of full-length genomes into permissive cells, recombinant viruses are recovered which contain the genetic content of the molecular clone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 91, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 92, "end": 95, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 96, "end": 100, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 388, "end": 392, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1606, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1936, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2136, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2200, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2204, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2794, "end": 2798, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2878, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3017, "end": 3021, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3148, "end": 3151, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3152, "end": 3155, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3156, "end": 3159, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 234, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1615, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1945, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2706, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although the reverse genetic system (RGS) described here achieved prominence shortly after the emergence of SARS-CoV [16] , this platform has been used to generate CoV infectious clones that span nearly the entire breadth of the Coronaviridae family, including pathogenic viruses from groups 1a and 1b of the alphacoronaviruses and groups 2a, 2b, and 2c of the betacoronaviruses (Fig. 1) . The entire CoV fragments are joined by type IIS or IIG restriction sites (e.g., BglI, SapI, and BsaI) that support directional, seamless ligation into full-length genome (Fig. 2) . For type IIS (e.g., SapI) restriction enzymes, the recognition sequences are separated from its cleavage site by one or more variable nucleotides, leaving three to four nucleotide unique overhangs (Fig. 2) . Thus, these enzymes leave 64-256 unique ends, providing directionality during multi-segment assembly. Moreover, the recognition site is not palindromic, allowing for seamless assembly of component cDNA clones into full-length genes and genomes. By orienting the recognition sequence external to the cleavage site, upon digestion and ligation, the restriction site is lost, seamlessly joining the cDNAs, while preserving ORF integrity and sequence authenticity. A second approach uses type IIG (e.g., BglI) restriction endonucleases, which has a palindrome restriction site, bisected by a variable domain of five nucleotides and also leaves 64 different overhangs for directional assembly of large genome molecules (Fig. 2) . In this instance, the restriction site is retained in the assembled product. As coronavirus genomes are unstable in bacteria, junctions are oriented within toxic sequence domains, thereby bisecting region toxicity and increasing component clone stability. Plasmids are digested with type IIS or IIG restriction enzymes to isolate each fragment of the CoV genome (Fig. 2) . Fragments are then resolved on an agarose gel, purified, and ligated (Fig. 2 ). Following ligation, the coronavirus genome-length mRNA is in vitro transcribed from a T7 promoter added at the 5\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 UTR. In some instances, strong T7 stop sites are mutated to promote full-length transcript synthesis in in vitro transcription reactions [20] . Resulting genomelength mRNA is electroporated into a permissive mammalian cell line (Fig. 2) . Cloning success and viral fitness can be measured by plaque assay and growth curves (Fig. 3) .

Northern blot analysis of CoV RNA, and/or PCR of viral cDNA, affords visualization of sgRNA and confirmation of replication-competent virus (Fig. 4) . The efficiency of RGS is exemplified by the fact that an infectious clone of SARS-CoV (icSARS) was generated and published [16] within weeks of the initial publication of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain sequence [26] ( Fig. 1 ). The use of DNA synthesis companies to synthesize a full-length coronavirus genome was achieved in 2008, using HCoV NL63 as a model [27] , Finally, our group has applied this approach to generate stable molecular clones for flaviviruses that include dengue and the newly emerged Zika virus [31, 32] . Importantly, fragmenting HCoV genomes confers additional biological safety benefits over reverse genetics systems that would otherwise maintain a CoV genome as a cDNA molecule comprising greater than 2/3 of the full-length genome. As sanctioned by \"NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines), April, 2016\" Section III-E-1 indicates that \"Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment.\" Moreover, full-length CoV genomes that encode select agents such as SARS-CoV are further regulated under the Federal Select Agent Program (www.selectagents.gov), and must be handled according to specific guidelines. . sgRNA is generated during active coronavirus replication and can be visualized by northern blot (left) and PCR (right). Using a biotinylated or radioactive probe against the CoV N-gene, all sgRNA species can be visualized by running RNA isolated from CoV-infected cells on a northern gel (left). Northern blot image is reprinted from [25] . Alternately, PCR primers contained within the leader sequence and N-gene can be used to generate PCR products from viral cDNA in order to visualize sgRNA, signifying productive CoV replication (right). Here, PCR products confirm productive replication of MERS-CoV in the lungs of a mouse permissive to MERS-CoV infection (transgenic mouse lung), but not in a nonpermissive, wild-type mouse lung. Both of these methods can be used to confirm productive CoV replication following RGS clone generation Partitioning the SARS-CoV genome allows for efficient handling of genomic fragments under standard BSL1/2 containment conditions (Fig. 2) .

Notably, because MA15 SARS-CoV is a novel virus strain, RGS is an effective method to validate Koch's postulates by demonstrating a causeand-effect relationship. After nearly a decade of research the MA15 strain continues to play a dominant role in SARS-CoV mouse pathogenesis studies, including vaccine and therapeutic evaluations [7, 17, [37] [38] [39] . In today's research environment these studies would be considered gain-of-function (GOF) studies, and thereby would have been subject to increased government oversight, which would have inevitably stymied progress into understanding the molecular mechanisms governing emerging coronavirus pathogenesis, host range, receptor usage, virus replication, and vaccine and therapeutic efficacy [3] . Notably, SARS-CoV gain-of-function (GOF) studies have yielded invaluable information regarding the role of viral proteins in pathogenesis in animal models and in tissue culture studies [17, 36] .
