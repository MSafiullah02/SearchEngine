            "text": "Improved molecular diagnostic techniques have increasingly revealed a high prevalence of viral pneumonia over recent years. Globally, it is now estimated that 100 million cases of viral pneumonia occur annually, with the incidence varying by seasonality, geographic location, and age group [1] . Respiratory viruses are detected as etiological agents in almost one third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [2] [3] [4] [5] and in 7%-36% of patients with severe CAP with a defined microbial etiology [2, 3] . Recently, Jain et al [2] analyzed 2320 cases of pneumonia detected by intensive microbiological diagnosis, including viral molecular techniques. A microbial etiology was identified in 853 cases (38%). The 3 main causes were respiratory viruses (23%), bacteria (11%), and coinfections (3%), indicating the clear prominence of a viral etiology. CAP is often complicated by sepsis, which is a multifactorial process for which staging is necessary to provide personalized treatments that target individual needs [6] . Viral sepsis has been defined as a severe inflammatory response to viral infection [7] , and unlike bacterial sepsis, its prevalence in adults with CAP is unknown.",

We excluded nonhospitalized patients and those with severe immunosuppression, active tuberculosis, viral bacterial coinfection, and unavailable data. We selected patients with pure viral CAP and compared those with and without sepsis. Severe CAP was defined according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [8] . Sepsis was defined as the presence of pneumonia and an increase of \u22652 points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score [6] . Diagnosis of respiratory virus infection was made on the basis of results of serologic analysis, immunofluorescence assay, and cell cultures from 2005 to 2007. However, diagnosis was based on results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or culture of nasopharyngeal swab samples from 2008 to 2017. Two independent nested multiplex real-time PCR tests were used to detect human influenza viruses (A, B, and C), respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses (1-4), coronaviruses (229E and OC43), enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses (A, B, and C). The criteria for etiological diagnosis are available in a previous report [3] . The main clinical outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality among patients admitted to the ICU, length of ICU stay, need for mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. Patients were followed for one year. For publication purposes, the study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution (Comit\u00e9 \u00c8tic d'Investigaci\u00f3 Cl\u00ednica; registration no. 2009/5451).

Although respiratory viruses are reported to be important causative agents of severe CAP [9] , the prevalence of pure viral sepsis is not fully known. A recently published study investigated the role of virus detection by multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal samples from clinically septic patients during a winter season [10] . The authors reported that respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in 70% of adult patients with sepsis. In another study, Montull et al [11] investigated the predictors of severe sepsis in patients with CAP and found that 38% of patients presented with severe sepsis and that 0.5% were identified to have respiratory viruses as casual agents. The proportion of patients with pure viral sepsis was slightly higher in our study population, but we think that this was due to our use of the new Sepsis-3 definition. Montull et al also highlighted the association between older age and development of viral sepsis, which was in line with our finding that viral sepsis affected 64% of patients (88) aged \u226565 years. These results are consistent with data showing that, because of the increased prevalence of chronic conditions and age-related changes in the immune system, elderly patients are more susceptible to infectious diseases and sepsis. It is also possible that the endothelium is fragile in this population [12] . Male sex was another risk factor for pure viral sepsis, consistent with data that men typically have more chronic comorbidities and a higher incidence of CAP than women [13] .",
