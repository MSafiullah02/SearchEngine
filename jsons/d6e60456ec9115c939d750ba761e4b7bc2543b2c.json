The speed of scientific discovery related to COVID19 is unprecedented. With several vaccine candidates already being tested in clinical trials, we pose the question: what will the vaccine hesitant do in the face of this pandemic?",

Skepticism about vaccines is a timeworn concept with shifting ideologies that reflect historical events and individual belief systems reflective of different societal periods. While the term \"antivax\" is ascribed to contemporary vaccine skeptics, \"hesitant\" is often a better descriptor for the majority of parents who contemplate or request delaying vaccines for their children or deviating from the recommended immunization schedule. The term hesitant avoids polarization into \"pro\" versus \"anti\" vaccination factions. Hesitancy implies, however, that minds can be swayed towards acceptance, and as pediatricians armed with the latest data, we are frustrated that these facts and figures do not always convince parents in our exam rooms and those we encounter on social media that vaccination is right for their children. How and why does this hesitancy shift from physician-guided acceptance of vaccines to their refusal?",

One important consideration is that vaccine hesitancy has evolved in response to the complicated but ultimately successful history of vaccine science.

However, some vaccine-preventable diseases are now making a comeback, which is putting our nation's children at risk.",

These outbreaks led to the possibility that the United States would lose measles elimination status, initially awarded almost 20 years ago. Despite remarkable advances in vaccine science, vaccine hesitancy has now become a recognized public health threat with potentially disastrous complications. Anti-immunization sentiment is at an all-time high and the medical community has recognized the need to address it as a public health emergency, with research, action, and advocacy.",

Vaccine hesitancy is not a superficial issue with a universal solution, however. Rather, it is a multifaceted, deeply complex construct that may be rooted in the moral composition that guides our daily decision making. Research has shown that several distinct values are associated with vaccine hesitancyparticularly purity, liberty, and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t anti-authority 4 . Combined with the historical amnesia of the consequences of vaccinepreventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy becomes easier to understand as a belief system grounded in certain moral values.

Hesitant families frequently express concern about vaccine safety, but even this issue has multiple layers, including fears regarding potential links to autism (now thoroughly refuted 5 ), learning difficulties, and chronic illnesses, as well as a perceived lack of safety testing prior to approval for use 6 . A famous quote from Bernard Shaw applies here: \"The greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished.\" Properly identifying and completely responding to fears regarding vaccines within the confines of a 15-minute well visit is next to impossible. Furthermore, how we discuss and communicate about vaccines, as much as the evidence-based facts provided, may be very important. We need a systematic assessment of factors affecting vaccine uptake on a continuing basis to develop the most effective and efficient communication strategies. As a medical community, we must investigate the determinants of vaccine hesitancy and the continuously evolving challenges it entails in order to tailor evidence-based strategies to overcome the problem with sustainable interventions.",

In his statement of support 7 , the WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus asserted that \"These online efforts must be matched by tangible steps by governments and the health sector to promote trust in vaccination and respond to the needs and concerns of parents.\" In order to adequately respond to these needs and concerns, which differ depending on the cultural, societal, and personal beliefs of a particular region, the WHO recommends that each country take steps to develop an understanding of vaccine hesitancy at a local level on an ongoing basis 8 .

As cases increased nationally, CDC officials tracked cases and exposures across state lines. However, insight into the vulnerability of exposed communities was varied, and depended solely on the quality and attention state governments paid to evaluating MMR immunization rates in those communities. New York State, for example, quickly realized reluctance to immunize was centered in specific Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland counties and was rooted in concerns about potential pork products in vaccines. With local governments, the state created public awareness campaigns led by rabbis urging vaccination. Other areas, absent this granular understanding, could simply react to burgeoning cases and missed opportunities that may have prevented the spread of cases to 31 states.",

The bipartisan bill introduced in May 2019 will amend the Public Health Service Act of 1944 to support a rigorous scientific approach to learn more about the factors that drive vaccine hesitancy and will fund national surveillance of hesitant regions. While commendable, it should be noted that the requested resources in the current version of the VACCINES Act are inadequate to fund serious communications campaigns, given that some of the areas with the highest hesitancy also have the most expensive media markets. The bill does include a vital provision to support awareness campaigns tailored to specific communities that could prove to be an essential tool in the fight to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Signing this bill into law will provide a framework to better understand and respond to vaccine hesitancy in the United States.",

High-risk populations can be identified and specifically targeted based on their societal and cultural belief systems. Awareness campaigns can be tailored to specific locales to address identified concerns regarding vaccines. Studying all these factors will expand our armamentarium in preventing the rise of vaccine-preventable diseases. The VACCINES Act is currently in the first stage of the legislative process. It has been assigned to the House Energy and Commerce Committee where the chairs will determine if the bill will pass to the House Floor 9 . The odds of any bill becoming law at this stage are collectively low (around 3% since 2015) and even worse without strong public support 10 .
