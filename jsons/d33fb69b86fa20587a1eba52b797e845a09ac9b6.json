This includes (aggressive) testing and tracing, bans on large gatherings, school and university closures, international and domestic mobility restrictions and physical isolation, up to total lockdowns of regions and countries. However, effective and rapid decisionmaking during all stages of the pandemic requires reliable and timely data not only about infections, but also about human behavior, especially on mobility and physical co-presence of people.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most authorities are overwhelmed by the multiplicity and simultaneity of requests; as they have never been confronted with such a crisis, there are few predefined procedures and guides, so targeted and preventive action is quickly abandoned for mass actions.

Consider creating an ethics and privacy advisory committees to oversee and provide feedback on the projects. This ensures that privacy is maintained and raises potential user acceptance. It is possible to make use of aggregated mobile phone data in line with even the relatively strict European regulations (GDPR). Earlier initiatives have established principles and methods for sharing data or indicators without endangering any personal information and build privacy-preserving solutions that use only incentives to manage behavior [Buckee et al., 2018; de Montjoye et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2019] . The early inclusion of the data protection authority in Belgium (see box) has led to the publishing of a statement by the European Data Protection Board on how to process mobile phone data in the fight against COVID-19 [EDPB 2020]. Even while acknowledging the value of mobile phone data, the urgency of the situation should not lead to losses of data privacy and other civil liberties that might become permanent after the pandemic. In this regard, the donation of data for good (e.g. the MIT app) and the direct and limited (in time and scope) sharing of aggregated data by mobile network operators with (democratic) governments and researchers seems to be less problematic than the use of individual location data commercially acquired, brought together and analyzed by commercial enterprises. More generally, any emergency data system set to monitor COVID-19 and beyond must follow a balanced and well-articulated set of data policies and guidelines and be subjected to risk assessments.",

Individual mobility and contact data offer information about infected individuals, their locations and socialnetwork. Contact data can be collected through mobile apps[Dong et al., 2019;Ferretti et al., 2020], interviews, surveys, voluntary sharing of data, or by accessing individual mobile phone data, which presents serious ethical and legal concerns.",

These metrics are typically constructed within a municipality by dividing the city into grids or neighborhoods [Louail et al., 2014]. The estimated number of people in each geographical unit can be computed with different time granularities (e.g. 15', 60', 24h). \u2022 Amount of time spent at home, at work, other are estimates of the individual percentage of time spent at home/work/other location, which can be useful to assess the local aversion to countermeasures adopted by governments. The home and work locations need to be computed in a period of time prior to the deployment of mobility restrictions measures. The percentage of time spent in each location needs to be computed from stationary points, thus excluding people that move. Variations of the time spent on different locations is generally computed on an individual basis, and then spatially aggregated.",

Along this line, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other collaborators are working on Private Kit: Safe Paths [Barbar et al., 2020], a free open-source and privacy-first contact-tracing technology that provides individuals with information on their interaction with diagnosed COVID-19 carriers.Fig 2: Illustration of outbreaks (orange curve) and adaptive triggering (blue curve) of suppression strategies.[Ferguson et al. 2020: 12]    3. Specific metrics for data-supported decisions Mobile phone traces can be exploited to infer human mobility and social interactions. Researchers have used various types of mobile network data (e.g. Call Details Records, x Data Records and passive records), GPS and mobile application data. Some of this data, such as CDRs, are collected 7/16 by mobile network operators for billing reasons, and each record contains information about the time and (approximate) geographical location of customers' interactions with the phone. Other data consists of very accurate geographic information that can be collected at a large scale by smartphone applications(Walle 2020), however often with limited coverage in developing countries and raising complex questions around privacy and civil liberties.",
