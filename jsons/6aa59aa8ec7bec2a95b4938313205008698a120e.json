In bacterial meningitis, abnormal and asymmetrical enhancement of the leptomeninges and the subarachnoid space is typical. Initial neuroimaging has to rule out infectious foci of the skull base such as purulent sinusitis or mastoiditis. In patients with focal deficits or seizures, MRI is the tool of choice to diagnose vascular or septic complications. Neoplastic, viral, or fungal infections of the CNS may present with similar changes of the meninges; however, fungal meningitis normally causes a thicker and more nodular enhancement. In case of basal accentuation of the leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and conspicuous signal changes in the basal cisterns, one has to consider tuberculous meningitis for differential diagnosis, especially in patients with HIV infection. Non-infectious causes of meningeal enhancement comprise several primary and secondary tumors (e.g., CNS lymphoma, medulloblastoma, or breast cancer), granulomatous diseases, and post-operative changes.",

The space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space (SAS). The vessels within the leptomeninges have a blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB) that inhibits leakage of endogenous and exogenous serum compounds under physiological conditions. Infections of the leptomeninges and the SAS cause multiple pathophysiological changes in brain homeostasis. The SAS is infiltrated with inflammatory cells, which release glycoproteins and toxins that affect the tight junctions of the vascular endothelium, leading to a breakdown of the BBB. Serum fluid, proteins, and cells leak into the SAS and the adjacent cortex and cause interstitial and parenchymal edema. The breakdown of the BBB also allows contrast material to leak from the vessels into the CSF. The typical pattern of leptomeningeal enhancement follows the surface of the brain and fills the SAS of the sulci and cisterns. While bacterial and viral meningitis are supposed to exhibit enhancement that is thin and linear, fungal meningitis and neoplastic infiltration of the leptomeninges may produce thicker, lumpy, or nodular enhancement in the SAS. A list of the potential causes of leptomeningeal enhancement is given in Table 11 .1.",

The vessels within the dura mater do not produce a BBB; thus, serum compounds, such as albumin, fibrinogen, or contrast agent, can leak into the dura mater. Therefore, the pachymeninges can be seen on contrast-enhanced CT or T1-weighted MR images as a thin, linear, and sometimes discontinuous enhancement, following the inner table of the skull, the falx, and the tentorium cerebelli. Typically, irritation and inflammation of the pachymeninges may arise from various benign or malignant processes, including transient postoperative changes, intracranial hypotension, meningioma, metastases, lymphoma, and granulomatous disease that lead to vasocongestion and interstitial edema of the dura mater (Table 11 .2). Classical imaging features of isolated inflammation of the pachymeninges include thickening and increased enhancement of the dura-arachnoid complex without enhancement of the sulci or brain surface ( Fig. 11 .1).

Meningitis is the most common form of CNS infection in children. Mortality ranges between 20 and 30%, and neurological sequelae occur in 15\u221240% of surviving patients. Infection may arise from hematogenous spread during systemic infection, from a chronic suppurative focus, or per continuitatem during acute or chronic infections of the paranasal sinus, the middle or inner ear, or the mastoid. Another path of infection is brain injury with open or covered disruption of the dura mater, especially when the paranasal sinus or the air-filled cavities of the temporal bone are involved in the fracture. The type of microorganism responsible for meningitis depends on the age of the patient and the way of infection: while in neonates the most common pathogens are group-B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli, in infants it is Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis. In adolescents and adults Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis are found most often. In a recent study on the epidemiology of 696 episodes of community-acquired meningitis in adults, S. pneumoniae was determined to be the responsible pathogen in 51%, N. meningitides in 37%, and Listeria monocytogenes in 4% of cases (van de Beek et al. 2004 ); however, due to vaccination against H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, epidemiology of bacterial meningitis changes constantly.",

On admission more than 90% of patients with bacterial meningitis present with at least two of the following four symptoms: fever; neck stiffness; changes in mental status -the \"classical triad\" -and headache. Headache is the most common symptom in meningitis and is found in more than 80% of the patients. Further symptoms indicating irritation of the leptomeninges are nausea, conjunctivitis, hyperesthesia, and hyperacusis. Approximately one fourth of the patients develop petechial rash, with N. meningitidis as the most frequent causative pathogen. One third of the patients have focal neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsy, aphasia, hemiparesis, or seizures. These symptoms are associated with a lower level of consciousness and indicate a more severe course of the disease; they are more frequent in pneumococcal than in meningococcal meningitis (van de Beek et al. 2004 ). Bacterial meningitis may be complicated by cortical and subcortical infarctions due to septic vasculitis of the cerebral arteries, hydrocephalus, brain edema, empyema, or pyogenic abscess. Systemic complications result from bacteremia and comprise the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (e.g., meningococcal sepsis with disseminated intravasal coagulation and petechial bleeding), the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic emboli into the lung or peripheral vessels.",

As a sign of beginning disturbance of the CSF circulation, CT might reveal mild enlargement of the ventricles and the SAS; the basal cisterns can be effaced. After administration of contrast medium, CT might demonstrate linear leptomeningeal enhancement in the sulci and cisterns that might increase during the course of the disease, especially if antibiotic treatment is not started or is started with de-lay (Kastrup et al. 2005) . Parenchymal lesions are often difficult to distinguish; however, CT is a simple and fast tool for monitoring critically ill patients and to rule out severe complications of bacterial meningitis, such as resorptive hydrocephalus, swelling, venous thrombosis, or infarction. Besides cerebral structures, CT provides important information about probable pathologies of the skull base, the temporal bone, and the nasal sinus, such as fractures, purulent sinusitis, otitis media, or mastoiditis; therefore, CT of patients with bacterial meningitis should always include a reconstruction of the skull base in the \"bone window\".",

Signs of meningeal affection often begin slowly and without disturbances of consciousness. Because of the predominant affection of the basal parts of the meninges, TBM frequently causes cranial nerve palsy, primarily of the abducent nerve, the oculomotoric nerve, and the facial nerve. In severe cases TBM may affect also caudal cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Hydrocephalus and secondary vasculitis are main complications. Mortality is still 10-20%; it is even higher in underdeveloped countries and after delayed diagnosis.",

The typical imaging feature of TBM is enhancement of the basal cisterns and the corresponding leptomeninges caused by dense fibrinous exudate in the SAS (Fig. 11 .5). Basal meningeal enhancement is found in approximately 60% of TBM cases. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that tuberculous meningitis is not only seen on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, but also on non-enhanced T1-weighted MT images, showing the inflamed meninges as distinct basal periparenchymal hyperintensity (Kamra et al. 2004 ). This phenomenon is reported to be missing in patients with meningitis of other etiology; thus, visibility of the meninges on non-enhanced T1-weighted MT images has to be considered highly suggestive of tuberculous meningitis. Yet, one has to keep in mind that formation of exudates requires a competent immune system in the host, as a consequence meningeal enhancement is often less pronounced or even missing in elderly patients and individuals with immune deficiency (Srikanth et al. 2007) .",
