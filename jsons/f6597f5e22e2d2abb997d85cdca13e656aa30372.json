The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P \u02c2 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P \u02c2 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study.

Although cross-contamination occurred, feed batch sequencing did reduce the amount of detectible PEDV RNA in feed after sequencing 2 batches of swine diet following the positive batch. Thus, sequencing virally contaminated feed appears to be similar to sequencing medicated feed in effort to reduce carryover. Sequencing a batch of medicated-free feed has been shown to reduce significant drug carryover in medicated feed manufacturing (Herrman et al., 1995; Martinez-Kawas, 2008) and has been adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an approved clean-out procedure for manufacturing medicated feed (FDA, 1976) .

Manufacturing equipment was not cleaned nor disinfected between batches during feed mixing and conveying to mimic the feed manufacturing process in a commercial mill. Even after 2 sequences, detectible PEDV RNA persisted in feed from the bucket elevator whereas no PEDV RNA was detected in feed from the mixer. This observation could be due to cross-contamination that occurred within the boot of the bucket elevator. Buckets within the bucket elevator are designed to pick up their load from the bootwhich is dead space or pit area-that fills with feed at the bottom foot pulley. This space is filled with previously discharged product, thus charging the boot. In commercial settings, manual clean-out of the boot is not done on a regular basis (Tilley, 2013) due to time constraints, difficult accessibility, messiness, and was seemingly unnecessary prior to this research. Therefore, the boot can create a potential source of cross-contamination as batches of feed are manufactured. Another source for persistent PEDV detection in conveyed feed could have originated from contaminated equipment surfaces following PEDV positive feed production. In a complementary study to the current experiment, we monitored the rapid widespread contamination that ensued after production of a PEDV-contaminated batch of feed and demonstrated swabs collected from the plastic bucket elevator buckets and rubber belt remained rRT-PCR positive during feed sequencing . An additional source of cross-contamination is possibly from the mixer. Although the mixer was empty and clean between discharges by commercial feed manufacturing standards, some feed (approximately 1.4 kg via preliminary data) always remained at the bottom of the mixer.

Additionally, wet disinfection is not ideal for feed mills since mainly dry ingredients are used and because most of the equipment has limited accessibility needed for chemical cleaning (Huss et al., 2015) . Instead, feed production facilities must rely on physical cleaning and good manufacturing procedures to prevent spread of microorganisms; however, these methods have been proven to increase contamination (Huss et al., 2015) . Even with chemical disinfectant, PEDV genetic material has proven difficult to eliminate in the FSRC .
