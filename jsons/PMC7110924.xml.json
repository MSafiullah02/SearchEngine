The spread\nof these diseases depends on a vector that transmits a parasite to humans, and in some\ncases, to animals. The vector is an infected female mosquito. The dynamics of the\nhuman-vector interaction can be summarized as follows. An infected vector, whose saliva\ncontains the parasite, transmits the latter to a human host through a bite. Once in the\nhost, the parasite passes through several stages, until it migrates to the red blood cells.\nA vector can become infected upon biting an infected host. Within the vector, the parasite\nalso undergoes several phases and finally migrates to the salivary glands, repeating the\ncycle.",

To model\nheavily and sparsely populated regions, for example, Di\ncould take two values, generating clumps of sites with the same value. Determine in\nwhich regions the epidemic is more likely to persist, and where the density of\ninfected hosts and vectors is greatest.(3)The algorithms we have described require that a new realization be started each time\nthe absorbing state is reached. A useful alternative, especially in the vicinity of\nthe critical point, is quasistationary simulation, in which the\nabsorbing state is effectively removed from the state space. The method is described\nin detail in Ref. 25. Here, we simply provide a\nrecipe, which runs as follows. We maintain a collection of\nNs saved configurations, starting from the initial one\n(which might have all hosts and vectors infected). In the initial phase of the\nsimulation, we save the current configuration to the list at each time step. Once\nNs configurations are saved, we update the list,\nsubstituting a configuration on the list with the current configuration, with\nprobability pr at each unit time interval. (The\nreplacement probability pr is determined by the condition\nthat the residence time, Ns/pr\nof a configuration on the list be long compared to the mean lifetime of the process,\nyet short compared to the duration of the simulation.) The evolution of the process\nproceeds as before, except when an absorbing configuration is reached. In this case,\nthe latter is exchanged for one of the saved configurations, which, by construction,\nis active. Following an initial transient, this modified process attains the\nquasistationary distribution; that is, the probability distribution conditioned on not\nhaving visited the absorbing state. Averages over this distribution correspond to\nasymptotic long-time properties of the active process and may be used to infer the\ncritical properties. Use quasistationary simulations to determine the infected host\nand vector densities as a function of one of the parameters. Convenient values for the\nquasistationary scheme are Ns=1000 and pr=0.001.\n",
