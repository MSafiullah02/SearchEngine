For making such decisions, investigators need to determine the risk benefit ratios of the Research visits, seek local and national guidance, assess level of risk of the pandemic in their setting, optimize staffing issues, and minimize risk involved to each participant. Given that disruptions to the study are likely in most cases, investigators should inform the study sponsors and regulatory bodies in a timely manner. Protocol revisions to allow remote data collection using video interview apps such as zoom and Skype should be considered. Participant input should be considered as well. If an in-person visit is decided upon, it is important to make sure that all precautions including protective care are fully implemented, and the participants\u2019 and researchers\u2019 safety carefully monitored. Interestingly, many participants appear to support continuation of medical research during epidemics (Padala et al., 2020).",

Environmental exposures such as green space, air pollution and housing conditions may all serve to increase risk for or protect against mental disorders (Attademo et al., 2017). Several questions are worth addressing in this context. What is the impact of medical comorbidity in psychiatric disorders on risk for Covid-19 infection? Does intimate partner violence increase in the context of restriction of social mobility outside of home? Are psychiatric disorders likely to worsen because of this? Is the decreasing air pollution across the globe as a result of the Covid-19 crisis (Dutheil et al., 2020) Likely to be protective for mental illness? Which co-morbid illnesses are likely to enhance risk of exposure to Covid-19 and of severe illness and mortality? Does medical comorbidity increase likelihood of psychiatric disorders in relation to Covid-19? Is social distancing likely to increase loneliness and psychiatric symptoms as a consequence (Narita et al., 2020)? There is evidence that anxiety and distress are positively associated with interpersonal distance in schizophrenia patients. The shelter in place regulations as a result of the current pandemic are forcing people to stay at home with effect of decreasing interpersonal distance in the home setting. The impact of such social changes on the trajectory of serious mental illness is worth investigating.",

Emerging evidence already suggests that the COVID-19 virus may target the brain (Li et al., 2020), and cause neuropsychiatric symptoms in 36% of hospitalized patients (Mao et al., 2020).. Psychiatric sequelae may also result from trauma and grief, social isolation as well as the secondary consequences of the quarantine and its effects on lifestyle. Proactive collection of research oriented data about the neuropsychiatric dimensions of patients presenting in the context of the covert crisis across institutions would be critically important. Also important are the questions about how people with already existing mental illness are coping when faced with the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 crisis. It is also important to investigate reactions of the mentally ill persons to isolation, uncertainty, and lack of access to needed care, and about what therapeutic strategies are working.",

Governments are rapidly relaxing constraints for telemedicine such as licensing, data confidentiality, and reimbursement issues. Questions for the future include characterization of settings and populations where telemedicine is most appropriate, and identification of the factors that underlie community level acceptance of these approaches to care, including the impact of sustained vs temporary regulatory changes in policy (Bashshur et al., 2020). Telemental Health allows use of technologies such as videoconferencing, to remotely deliver mental health services including assessment, and medication management (Whaibeh et al., 2020). Stress-relieving interventions such as Yoga can also be delivered remotely (Schulz-Heik et al 2017). Digital health can also go a long way to deliver mental health services remotely in disasters; several effective and user-friendly digital platforms are emerging for improving mental health care via smartphones (Torous and Keshavan, 2020).",

Given the almost universal nature of the pandemic, collaboration is needed across mental health researchers to rapidly develop and share large datasets on the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, Such knowledge will not only help mount an effective response to the current pandemic but will also enhance our ability to effectively address future similar disasters. It is encouraging that the National Institutes of Health and other funders are now beginning to facilitate administrative supplements to enable researchers in these endeavors.
