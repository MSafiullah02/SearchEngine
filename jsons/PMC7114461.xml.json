The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, approximately 21 kb, encodes two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1ab, which encode 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsps 2\u201316 (IBV does not have nsp 1) including a papain-like protease 2 (the PL1 protease is truncated and non-functional in IBV), a main protease, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and several other non-structural proteins involved in making up the replication transcription complex. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and a number of nonstructural proteins. The spike glycoprotein of IBV forms projections on the surface of the virion. Spike is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 subunit forming the outermost portion and S2 forming a stalk like structure that is embed in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host cell receptors, membrane fusion and entry into the host cell, and it contains conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes (Cavanagh et al., 1998, Niesters, 1987).",

However, pathogenicity in IBV is associated with spike as well as genes outside of spike (Ammayappan et al., 2009, Cavanagh, 2007, Hodgson et al., 2004). Because typing is focused on the analysis of spike, there is no clear understanding of whether viruses with similar spike proteins also share high sequence similarities in other regions of the genome especially in regions associated with pathogenicity. This gap in knowledge results from the lack of complete genome sequences from viruses of the same serotype.",

The genome sequences were aligned and phylogenetic analysis was conducted to examine genetic relationships between the viruses. Estimates of the rates of mutation were calculated and evidence of recombination was investigated for each of the full-length genome sequences.

The recombination events in IBV/Mass/06 were identified using Simplot, which showed that the IBV/Mass/06 genome shared a high sequence similarity, 97\u2013100%, with CAL and Conn isolates in different regions of ORF1ab, with Mass in the S1 gene and with Conn isolates in the remainder of the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Fig. 3A). At the extreme 3\u2032 end of ORF1ab, between nucleotides 15,500 and 19,800, the IBV/Mass/06 virus did not show any significant sequence similarity with any of the genomes in this study. A BLAST analysis of that region showed 99% similarity with IBV strain H120 (Acc. No. FJ807652). The Simplot bootscan analysis revealed a total of seven breakpoints located at approximate nucleotide positions 1530, 5895, 8188, 11,200, 12,266, 19,918 and 21,975 in the IBV/Mass/06 virus (Fig. 3B). The sequences located between the breakpoints were designated regions I\u2013VIII, respectively. Regions one through five were located in nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp9 and nsp11/12 respectively. Region VII contained the entire S1 glycoprotein gene, whereas the S2 glycoprotein gene was in region VIII.",

            "text": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses. Presumably, high rates of mutation and rapid replication drive their evolution. Infectious bronchitis virus, like most RNA viruses, undergoes a high rate of genetic change that contributes to diverse subpopulations of the virus that continually emerge to form new variants of existing strains as well as completely new types of the virus. New variants and types of IBV are defined by the sequence of the spike glycoprotein and/or by specific antibodies against spike, and for many IBV types, only spike sequences are available. To examine sequence changes not only in spike but also over the entire length of the genome, we sequenced the full-length genomes of 5 Mass type, 4 Conn type and 2 CAL type IBV field viruses that were isolated over a 41, 25 and 8 year period respectively. All of the viruses were obtained from chickens with clinical signs of the disease. Alignments of the full-length genome sequences showed that the Mass viruses had \u226592.4% identity (\u226593.7% if the recombined IBV/Mass/06 is not included), the CAL viruses had \u226593.8% identity and the Conn viruses varied the least, at \u226599.8% identity. Examination of the mutation rates for the ORF1ab, S1, E, M and N genes showed, in general, that the CAL viruses had rates between 10\u22124 and 10\u22122\n substitutions/site/year, whereas the Conn and Mass viruses had lower mutation rates that ranged from 10\u22124 to 10\u22126\n substitutions/site/year. In addition, the E gene in the Conn viruses showed no signs of change. Although the egg passage level of all the viruses used in this study was relatively low (\u226415 passages) it is possible some genetic changes could have been introduced as a result of propagation in embryonated eggs. However phenotypic change is likely to be minimal since it typically takes 75 or more egg passages to attenuate IBV and in a study that examined genetic changes in the highly variable S1 gene following 10 passages in embryonated eggs, five viruses had no changes, two viruses had only 2 nucleotide changes one virus had only 1 change (McKinley et al., 2008).",

Thus, it was surprising that mutation rates for Mass and Conn type viruses were lower than mutation rates for CAL type viruses because live attenuated vaccines have been used against the Mass and Conn type viruses in poultry for many years, whereas no vaccine exists for the CAL type viruses. One possible explanation for the differences in mutation rates is that the Mass and Conn viruses were possibly re-isolated vaccine viruses that have been circulating in the field for an unknown but relatively short period of time, with the exception of the IBV/Conn/66 virus, which did show positive selection when compared to the other Conn viruses. In contrast, because no vaccine exists for CAL viruses, those viruses represent true field isolates that have been circulating for known periods of time.",

It has been shown that IBV can be shed for long periods of time and that vaccine viruses can persist in the field and revert to cause disease (Farsang et al., 2002, Jackwood et al., 2009, Matthijs et al., 2008, Naqi et al., 2003). Thus, it is possible that vaccine viruses are more likely to be isolated from the field because they may be more abundant having displaced field viruses of the same type or because they are more easily isolated since they are adapted to grow in embryonated eggs. Because the Mass and Conn type viruses were isolated from clinically diseased chickens suggests that if they were originally vaccine viruses then they have likely acquired the sequence changes necessary for pathogenicity. Further studies would need to be conducted on vaccine viruses and pathogenic strains to gain a better understanding of the molecular changes necessary for coronavirus reversion to pathogenicity.",

Although the IBV/Mass/06 virus is identified as a Mass type virus based on characterization of the spike glycoprotein, it was shown herein to be a recombinant virus with Conn and CAL viruses as major parents. Eight regions defined by 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome were identified. Region VII was similar to other Mass type viruses, which was expected because that region includes the entire S1 gene. However, CAL like sequences were found in regions I, III and V, Conn sequences were found in regions II, IV and VIII, and region VI was found be similar to the H120 Mass type vaccine strain. High frequencies of recombination including recombination events between vaccine and field strains have been reported for IBV (Brooks et al., 2004, Cavanagh et al., 1992, Fang et al., 2005, Jackwood et al., 2010, Kottier et al., 1995b, Lee and Jackwood, 2000, Yu et al., 2001). In addition, IBV pathogenicity was shown to be polygenic, involving spike as well as replicase proteins (Ammayappan et al., 2009, Armesto et al., 2009, Cavanagh, 2007, Hodgson et al., 2004). Although IBV type is defined by the spike glycoprotein, our data shows that viruses within the same type can have vastly divergent sequences in other regions of their genome including regions that contain genes important for pathogenicity. If recombination occurs outside of the spike gene where a pathogenic field virus acquires attenuated vaccine virus sequences, the outcome would likely be a relatively benign virus regardless of the virus types (spike sequences) involved. Furthermore, if a vaccine virus circulating in a flock recombines with a pathogenic virus outside of the spike gene, resulting in the vaccine virus becoming pathogenic, the outcome is still likely to be of little or no consequence since the birds would presumably be immune to the unchanging spike. However, in the event that a pathogenic field virus recombines with either a vaccine virus or another pathogenic virus and acquires a new or unique spike glycoprotein gene, the outcome could be the emergence of a new virus capable of causing disease. This was recently shown for TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010). Although new coronaviruses can emerge and cause disease as a result of recombination it appears that the emergence of most variant or new IBV types is due to accumulation of mutations in the spike glycoprotein over time (Cavanagh et al., 2005, Jackwood et al., 2005, Jackwood et al., 2007, Lee and Jackwood, 2001, Nix et al., 2000). Thus, until pathogenicity genes can be specifically identified, monitoring the spike gene in IBV appears to be the most reliable measure of genetic change leading to the emergence of new viruses capable of causing disease.",

Our data show that mutation rates are lower and that positive selection was not occurring for IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are used compared to an IBV type were no vaccine exists, suggesting that the virus isolates examined were re-isolated vaccine viruses that have been circulating in the field for a relatively short-period of time. This observation is extremely important because it could lead to incorrect estimates of mutation rates for RNA viruses where modified live vaccines are used to control the disease. In this study, we also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with two major parents and no fewer than 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome. Although recombination among coronaviruses can contribute to genetic diversity of the virus and recombination has been shown to lead to the emergence of new viruses, it appears that monitoring mutations in the spike gene that accumulate over time is currently the best method of identifying potentially new genetic variants and IBV types capable of causing disease.",
