The SARS-CoV-2 has spread across all continents since December and caused a public health crisis. 2 As of late April 2020, there has been more than 3 million cases and more than 200,000 deaths according to WHO. 3 A significant percentage of patients have severe or critical disease and require intensive care management. 4 Currently there is only one approved medication for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and many questions on clinical management remain unanswered. 5 To this end, more than 300 clinical trials are being conducted to find an effective treatment. 2 The ongoing public health emergency necessitates the discovery of reliable prognostic factors to help guide clinical decision making tailored to the patient characteristics. The identification of patient characteristics that are associated with adverse clinical events could provide alternative therapeutic targets as well as improve the design and analysis of future clinical trials. 6, 7 Also, the deciphering of risk factors having a detrimental effect on disease course could offer novel insights on molecular pathways of the disease.",

Also, hemoptysis could be a result of endothelial disruption and pulmonary vessel coagulopathy, which have been described in literature. 32 This finding is further corroborated by the association we unveiled between d-dimers and various adverse outcomes, as well as observational studies depicting increased thrombotic incidents in COVID-19 patients. 33 Symptoms typical in flu-like illness that originate outside the respiratory system and were linked with severe COVID-19 were fever, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Symptoms that have a negative impact on disease course could potentially be useful during patient assessment, i.e. they might be considered \"red flags\" that pinpoint patients being at high risk for a negative prognostic outcome and requiring enhanced monitoring or treatment. 34 Our results depicted that age is a risk factor related to severe COVID-19, progression of disease and mortality. Also, a dose-response association was observed between age and risk of mortality. However, it cannot be assumed that this finding is causal given that several chronic diseases may be confounders of this association. This finding is in accordance with our analysis indicating that major comorbid disorders of late adult life, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and COPD, are also markers associated with various adverse clinical events. Also, sex was identified as a statistically significant risk factor, presenting a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 and, a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of mortality and a 1.9-fold increase in the risk of ICU admission in male compared to female patients.",

Seventeen additional meta-analyses fulfilled the aforementioned characteristics with the exception of a 95% prediction interval that included the null value. These meta-analyses assessed the effect of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, prothrombin time, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, dyspnea, age, sex, elevated white blood cells on risk of mortality, the effect of coronary heart disease, malignancy, altered consciousness, and fatigue on risk of severe COVID-19, and the effect of chronic kidney disease, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and cardiovascular disease on risk of a composite outcome.

            "text": "various adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The association of hypertension with poor prognosis might be a result of the various systemic complications of hypertension. Another potential mechanism implicates the angiotensin converting enzyme, which is overexpressed in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. 35 This enzyme is a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and it is hypothesized that it could be responsible for acute myocardial injury inflicted by SARS-CoV-2. 35 Also, patients with COPD and other chronic lung diseases had an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and mortality. These patients have non-reversible structural lung abnormalities and lung function impairment. 17 They may have bacterial colonization, impaired immune defense and mucocilliary clearance of the lower respiratory tract, which might impair viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, COPD patients exhibit chronic respiratory failure and diminished respiratory reserve and infection by any virus may instigate an exacerbation of the disease. Furthermore, patients with diabetes mellitus, and malignancypresented worse prognosis. Both these patients have a compromised immune system, which disrupts patients' response to a viral agent. 36,37 There is published evidence that all of a serum biomarker to help individual risk stratification for each patient with COVID-19 could offer additional clinical insights. 31 In our analysis, a total of 16 serum biomarkers presented a significant effect on adverse clinical outcomes based on meta-analyses of at least three independent studies. Decreased lymphocyte count was associated with higher risk of progression of disease, and presentation with severe COVID-19 and is a laboratory feature used for disease diagnosis. 39 Elevated leukocyte count, CRP and procalcitonin are inflammatory markers, and they had a detrimental effect on disease course. 31 Moreover, serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) was associated with severity of disease, whereas LDH was associated with both severity of disease and mortality. Both are biomarkers increased from tissue damage, for LDH originating in any organ, while for CK originating mainly in the heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. For the same reason troponin might be a surrogate market of myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is associated with mortality. Also, dysregulation of liver and renal function, defined by abnormalities in serum ALT, AST, total bilirubin and albumin in the first case and increased serum creatinine in the second case, were associated with an elevated risk of adverse clinical events. Furthermore, the presence of blood coagulation disorders in patients with COVID-19 has a significant clinical impact, as confirmed by the metaanalyses assessing platelet count, d-dimers and prothrombin time with adverse clinical outcomes. 32Moreover, several findings from computed tomography of chest were linked with unfavorable clinical endpoints in patients with COVID-19. Of note, imaging features of lung involvement increased the risk of both severe COVID-19 and mortality. Radiological patterns that were associated with severity of COVID-19 included ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving and interstitial thickening. These findings might be a result of a more extensive inflammation of the lungs. Additional radiological findings that were associated with severe COVID-19 were, bronchial wall thickening, and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. These may be a result of prolonged inflammation which leads to structural long-term sequelae such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and bronchiectasis, as described after H1N1 influenza pneumonia and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. 41,42 Presence of pleural effusion was associated with severe COVID-19. There is published evidence that pleural effusion was a poor prognostic factor in MERS-CoV and H5N1 avian influenza patients.43  Pleural effusion could be an attribute of pleural inflammation from the SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial co-infection or exacerbation of pre-existing heart failure.",
