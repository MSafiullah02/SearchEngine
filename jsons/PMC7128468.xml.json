Soon after the outbreak of the disease, Peiris et al. [2] described how 19 out of 50 SARS patients (38%) progressed, in a short time frame (mean of 8.3 days), to severe pulmonary disease. All the uncomplicated cases recovered, whereas 8 patients deteriorated and, within the short follow-up period, one died. On the other hand, monitoring of serum antibodies shows that sero-conversion has occurred by about 10\u201312 days and, in most instances, the patient's immune defense is effectively intervening by around day 14. Therefore, from the onset of symptoms, 10\u201312 days is a critical window for active treatment.",

Levels of both TNF\u03b1 and IL-8 were effectively attenuated by anti-MIF [3].

[4] showed how, in the pediatric population, SARS patients have a markedly elevated level of circulating IL-1\u03b2 levels, which may suggest the involvement of a caspase-1-dependent activation pathway. In this study, there was only mild elevation of other cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF\u03b1. The Chinese literature, based on a larger number of patients of different ages, highlights the importance of other interleukins such as IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 [5], indicating the significant elevation of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 in late stages of the disease [6]. While these are systemic (not lung-specific) data and thus further experiments must be pursued to investigate the role of inflammatory cytokines in SARS, we propose that therapy targeting TNF\u03b1 and interleukins should be considered. To be effective, treatment should probably be instituted early before the pathophysiological changes become overwhelming. This may also help to control other extra-pulmonary manifestations in SARS patients that may be cytokine-related, such as the reported intravascular coagulation [7].",

This may represent treatment with established, multi-purpose drugs such as corticosteroids and ribavirin [10]. New imidazole derivatives have been recently designed as potent anti TNF\u03b1 and anti-IL-1 compounds [11]. A central aspect of this treatment may involve IL-1, both as a target for therapy [12] and as an indicator of disease progression [13]. Furthermore, a small but growing family of drugs has been shown to exhibit inhibitory effects against macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and TNF\u03b1 [14]. Monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors against TNF\u03b1, such as infliximab and etanercept, are commonly used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. CNI-149 [15], an inhibitor of TNF translation, has been shown to be effective in protecting animals from severe, acute inflammatory disorders. The promising results from studies with inhibitors of NF-\u03baB should also be exploited [16]. A basic representation of the cytokine activation pathway in the ARDS lung and the possible areas of therapeutic targeting are indicated in Fig. 1.",
