Carbohydrates are permanent components of many biological structures and biomembranes in human and in animal cells, as well as in bacterial and plant cell walls in the form of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids. Whether chains of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides have a distinct orientation in biomembranes or in cellular structures could not be solved until Romh\u00e1nyi and Fischer developed the aldehyde bisulfite toluidine blue reaction (ABT reaction) or \u201canisotropic PAS reaction\u201d (Romh\u00e1nyi et al., 1975) as a modification of the classical periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction (McManus, 1946).",

The disadvantage of the PAS reaction is the lack of birefringence (isotropic staining reaction) between crossed polars and so it does not provide any insight into the molecular order of the reactive components in tissues. However, with post-staining precipitation using a mixture of potassium ferricyanide solution and potassium iodide solution it is suitable to produce an anisotropic effect. Upon long-time exposure to polarised light, also the post-precipitation-complex is not stable and disintegrates (Makovitzky, unpublished data). Electron microscopy can ultrastructurally prove the presence of these components. They are localised as a carbohydrate rich cell coat at the cell surface (Rambourg, 1971; Rambourg and Leblond, 1967; Geyer, 1977; Geyer et al., 1973). By autoradiography (fluorography) cell-surface glycoproteins can be examined by means of incorporated radioactive molecules. New glycoprotein fractions were visualised with the help of this method (Gahmberg, 1981; Gahmberg and Hakomori, 1973; Gahmberg and Andersson, 1977).",

In this regard, polarisation microscopy with the topo-optical reactions offers new possibilities. Using the ABT reaction or \u201canisotropic PAS reaction\u201d carbohydrates can be detected with great sensitivity and their spatial location at a molecular level can be analysed. The reaction shows that the carbohydrate components are present in a highly linearly oriented fashion (parallel or perpendicularly to the length). Thus, it becomes possible to discover structural differences in biological systems (Romh\u00e1nyi et al., 1975; Fischer, 1976, Fischer, 1978; Fischer and Em\u00f6dy, 1976, Fischer and Em\u00f6dy, 1978).",

Only at this distance an interaction of the dye molecules bound to the OH groups takes place, which leads to the anisotropy and metachromasia. If the space is larger than 5 \u00c5, only basophilia and isotropy, like after the first step in the Feulgen reaction combined with the bisulfite toluidine blue reaction, is observed (Fischer, 1978). Due to the distance of the OH groups taking part in the ABT reaction, the indirect resolution range of the polarisation microscopy is theoretically between 2 and 5 \u00c5 (Romh\u00e1nyi, 1978; Fischer, 1978).",

According to Guthrie (1961) the structure of the product results from the oxidation of mono-, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides. The next step is the visualisation and/or blockade of aldehydes, i.e. the addition of sodium bisulfite (Malinin, 1970) or cyanide (Lillie, 1952, Lillie, 1965; Lillie and Pizzolato, 1972). Other possibilities of the blockade and visualisation of this reaction are reviewed by Reid and Park (1990).",

In the mPAS reaction, 2.7 moles periodate were consumed per mole oxidised sialic acid (Spiro, 1964). These reaction conditions are specific for sialic acid, since after an oxidation time of 10 min 1.15 mol periodic acid are consumed by N-acetyl neuraminic (sialic) acid, compared with less than 0.07 mol for all other carbohydrates together (Roberts, 1977). According to Schauer and Faillard (1968) and Schauer (1973) the consumption of periodic acid per mol oxidised N-acetyl neuraminic acid is 1.4 mol after 10 min, and 2 mol after 40 min.",

M\u00f3dis (1991) reinvestigated the two-step PAS reaction and combined it with the ABT reaction to the so called \u201cchemically intensified basophilic reaction\u201d, abbreviated as CIBR (Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006). Oxidation with freshly prepared periodic acid (2% solution) is the first step of this reaction, yielding aldehyde groups at the sites of vicinal diols located on carbohydrate residues (M\u00f3dis, 1991; Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006). The newly produced aldehyde groups in this position are blocked by subsequent treatment with sodium borohydride. A further prolonged oxidation with periodic acid (1% solution, 24 h) results in the oxidation of vicinal OH groups of glucuronic acid or iduronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate). After bisulfite addition, the newly produced hydroxysulfonate groups in the position C2 and C3 are selectively stained with toluidine blue or 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue at pH 1 (Figure 5\n). Sulfate groups bound primarily to glycosaminoglycans do also participate in this reaction, however they do not affect the oriented dye binding. It should be observed that the specificity of the staining is dependent on the low pH of the dye bath where the carboxyl groups are suppressed (Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006).",

In contrast, for amylose it was supposed that three different molecular conformations of the alpha-1-4-glucosan amylose are possible: stretched, folded or helical chains. Frey-Wyssling (1953) studied the polarisation of starch granules by optical and electron microscopy. These are known to consist of 22% amylose and 78% amylopectin (Bates et al., 1943). The starch granules, when unstained, have a high anisotropy and are linear negative (radially positive spherulites); therefore, the hexose molecules in starch granules are oriented opposite to those in cellulose. In starch granules, the hexose molecules are oriented radially and show a high intensity of anisotropy. This indicates a similar orientation of amylose and amylopectin in starch granules (Frey-Wyssling, 1953). The radial orientation confirm the results of the X-ray diffraction and the polarisation optical analysis of Frey-Wyssling, 1954, Frey-Wyssling, 1959, Frey-Wyssling, 1976. The amylose has a crystalline helical structure: a helical unit has 6 hexose molecules. Using the ABT reaction we found a radial orientation of the hexose molecules in complex starch granules, so it is an inversive topo-optical staining reaction (Figure 6\n). The sign is linear positive to the axis. The polysaccharide chains are parallel to the surface, in a helical orientation (Fischer, 1977; Makovitzky, 2003).",

In the ABT reaction, (Fischer, 1978) recorded a granular mosaic anisotropy with low intensity and no dichroismus. In opposition to the green polarisation colour of cellulose after ABT reaction, the glycogen shows a red polarisation colour. This is not the optimal polarisation colour and can be explained by the branched structure of glycogen, indicating bundles of carbohydrate chains with various orientations. The more complex polysaccharides dextran and galactan are isotropic with the ABT reaction. This observation is probably caused by the non-specific orientation of the polysaccharide chains.",

            "text": "The anisotropy of myelin sheaths was first investigated by Schmidt (1936). He presented them as highly oriented lipid membranes. Frozen sections of peripheral nerves show unstained an intense birefringence (Schmidt, 1936; Romh\u00e1nyi, 1978; Wolman, 1970). The sign of anisotropy is linear negative to the axis. After the ABT reaction, the frozen sections of the myelin sheaths show an intense basophilic staining reaction and a multiplication of the original birefringence. The linear oriented OH groups are parallel to the length axis. It is interesting that the myelin sheath, after formalin fixation (4% phosphate buffered formalin at pH 7.4) and paraffin wax embedding, shows a positive ABT reaction. After lipid extraction, Romh\u00e1nyi et al. (1975) found a positive ABT reaction and interpreted this result as the presence of oriented carbohydrates. However, in addition, one has to consider free aldehyde groups and the aldehyde groups produced from unsaturated lipids by periodic acid. In order to distinguish between the two possibilities, i.e. carbohydrates or lipids, Romh\u00e1nyi et al. (1975) considered several experimental results:a.The free groups of aldehydes can be stained selectively with a bisulfite toluidine blue reaction.b.The unsaturated bonds can be shown with a performic acid-Schiff reaction (Lillie, 1952) and/or with the polarisation optical variant \u2013 the performic acid bisulfite toluidine blue reaction.c.The carbohydrate component can be stained selectively with a performic acid-borohydride ABT reaction (Romh\u00e1nyi et al., 1975). In this reaction, the free aldehyde groups and aldehyde groups produced by periodic acid from double bonds are converted into OH groups by the effect of borohydride. These newly formed OH groups are not vicinal and therefore do not participate in the ABT reaction.\n",

Glycophorin has a molecular mass of 31,000 g/mol. It consists of 60% carbohydrates and 40% protein (Furthmayr, 1978b; Marchesi, 1979a, Marchesi, 1979b, Marchesi, 1983). From the amino acid sequences, the maximum length of the extracellular segment of glycophorin A is 168 \u00c5 (16.8 nm). Glycophorin A is highly glycosylated and its carbohydrate moiety amounts to 64% of the dry mass (Winzler, 1970; Stibenz, 1985). All saccharide chains are linked by O-glycosidic bonds to the N-terminal segment. Of the 16 saccharide chains of glycophorin A, 15 carry 30 terminal sialic acid residues (Furthmayr, 1978a, Furthmayr, 1978b) and this may affect the three-dimensional structure under physiochemical conditions. Later findings (Stibenz and Geyer, 1980; Geyer and Makovitzky, 1980) suggest that at physiologic pH and ionic strength, sialic acids are uniformly arranged and distributed, due to the spatial orientation of the glycoprotein segment and the high charge density of sialic acids. These reports were fully corroborated by the sialic acid specific topo-optical reaction.",

These sialic acids are oriented terminally and partially overlap (Geyer and Makovitzky, 1980; Halbhuber et al., 1983; Gliesing, 1987). The binding sites of the sugar chains have a distance of 0.4\u20130.5 nm in glycophorins to each other (Stibenz, personal communication 1980) and by parallel orientation of the carbohydrate chains this can also be assumed for the COOH groups of the sialic acid molecules. Between pH 5\u20137.4, this structure leads to metachromasia and anisotropy and to an optimal dye binding, characterized by a deep green polarisation colour in contrast to the toluidine blue topo-optical staining reaction (Figure 7\n).",

These treatments may affect the conformational state and change the original spatial orientation of the N-terminal hydrophilic segments of the glycophorin A. Stibenz and Geyer, 1980, Stibenz and Geyer, 1982 suggest two conformational states of hydrophilic segments of glycophorin A based on calculation of probability according to their amino acid sequence: (a) to run parallel to and (b) to have polar or polar and apolar interactions with the outer lamella of the lipid bilayer. On the basis of molecular theory of the toluidine blue topo-optical staining reaction (Makovitzky and Geyer, 1977; Geyer and Makovitzky, 1980), the topo-optical staining reaction behaviour of the various prepared ghost membranes can be understood by conformational changes, because all ghost preparations were carried out in the presence of a protease inhibitor. The reconstituted ghosts did not give the original intensity of control erythrocyte membranes (Geyer and Makovitzky, unpublished data; Gliesing and Halbhuber, 1989). Interestingly, the membrane anisotropy is restored after neuraminidase or combined enzymatic treatments with the aldehyde bisulfite 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue reaction (ABD). The residues obviously have some linear oriented OH groups and these groups are reactive.",

The highly anionic GAGs consist of repeating disaccharide units, containing hexosamine (either d-glucosamine or d-galactosamine) and hexuronic acid (either d-glucuronic acid or l-iduronic acid). The only GAG which is not bound to a protein core is hyaluronic acid. Proteoglycans represent a diverse group of glycoconjugates sharing the common basic feature that they all have at least one GAG side chain. The core protein is generally linear in shape \u2013 except some globular domains \u2013 and the extended GAGs are perpendicularly oriented to the protein backbone (Romh\u00e1nyi, 1963; M\u00f3dis, 1974, M\u00f3dis, 1991; Snow and Wight, 1989). The GAGs have a helical conformation and they \u2013 due to their high density of anionic charges (sulfates and carboxyls) \u2013 can easily interact with microcations like Na+, K+, Ca2+ and polycations. The polarisation optical classification of proteoglycans has been reviewed by M\u00f3dis (1991).",

The light microscopical reaction was developed originally by Scott and Dorling (1969). GAG components can be analysed using the toluidine blue reaction or 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue topo-optical reaction (Appel and Makovitzky, 2003; Makovitzky, 2001; M\u00f3dis, 1991; Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006). Fischer (1978) was first to demonstrate that GAGs also yield a pronounced ABT reaction after prolonged periodic acid incubation. In the literature, only marginal PAS-positivity of GAGs has been described. This is in contrast to the known linearly oriented OH groups of the uronic acids (Fischer, 1978). Thus, Fischer analysed the synovial fluid and its hyaluronic acid components with a prolonged ABT reaction. The hyaluronic acid components showed linear negative birefringence with respect to the length, i.e. the polysaccharide chains are oriented linear parallel to the length (axis).",

            "text": "Amyloid is a generic term referring to tissue deposits of highly organised insoluble fibrils. They are composed of three major components: the amyloid fibril protein, amyloid P component (AP) and GAGs. The amyloid P component comprises up to 15% of the amyloid deposits and consists of neutral hexoses and their derivates. Sialic acid and fucose are found in terminal positions in the oligosaccharide chains of the glycoprotein (Bladen et al., 1966; Binette et al., 1971; Haupt et al., 1972; Hess et al., 1988). In recent studies of the authors (Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006), topo-optical reactions were used to establish the structure, distribution and location of carbohydrate residues that occur within amyloid deposits. Congo red-marked amyloid deposits correlated pathomorphologically with ABT-positive structures, indicating a linkage of amyloid fibrils and periodate reactive carbohydrates (Figure 10\na\u2013d). Using the sialic acid specific topo-optical reaction, it became possible to visualise small amounts of sialic acids bound to the amyloid fibrils (Figure 10e, f). After the toluidine blue topo-optical reaction, the amyloid deposits exhibited metachromasia in bright light and birefringence with a red polarisation colour between crossed polars indicating the presence of sulfated GAGs. The critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) method revealed hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate in amyloid deposits and tissue-isolated amyloid fibrils (Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Appel et al., 2005; Makovitzky et al., 2006).",

(1975), Fischer (1978) as well as Fischer and Em\u00f6dy (1976) indicate that the polarisation optical analysis, by means of the ABT reaction, is a very sensitive and useful method to study the molecular order of the polysaccharide chains of plant cell walls, yeast cell walls and capsules. Our analyses show highly oriented sugar components and sialic acids in the erythrocyte membranes and lymphocyte membranes using the ABT reaction or ABD reaction, as well as sialic acid topo-optical reaction and its variants. A high intensity is often characteristic for the topo-optical staining reactions of erythrocyte and lymphocyte membranes, detecting ultrastructural differences between the membranes of red blood cells and lymphocytes, not amenable to other ultrastructural morphological methods.",

Further, the CIBR provides information on the orientation of primarily uronic acid-containing GAGs with potential vicinal diols (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate) in human and animal amyloid deposits (Appel and Makovitzky, 2003; Appel et al., 2005; Makovitzky, 2001; Richter, 2005a, Richter, 2005b; Richter and Makovitzky, 2006; Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2008). Based on the applied topo-optical reactions, it can be confirmed that the \u201cnon-fibrilar\u201d component of amyloid deposits (the amyloid P component with carbohydrate residues \u2013 including sialic acids \u2013 and GAGs) has a complex oriented structure and establishes an entity with the amyloid fibril proteins as well as lipids. We confirm the helical model for the amyloid fibril structure proposed by Inoue and Kisilevsky (1996).",
