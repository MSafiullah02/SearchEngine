            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are the major cytokines expressed during the innate immune response against invading pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Besides their role in restricting infections, IFNs also exhibit immunomodulatory functions, and have been implicated in both cancer immunosurveillance and autoimmunity [1,2,3]. IFNs can be produced by virtually all nucleated cells of jawed vertebrates and are classified into three major types: Type I, Type II, and Type III IFNs [4,5]. Type I IFNs are the most diverse family with 8 known subtypes, of which IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 can be expressed by nearly every cell type [6,7]. Type II IFN has only one member, IFN-\u03b3, and is mainly expressed by activated natural killer (NK) and T-cells [8,9,10]. Type III IFNs, IFN-\u03bbs, have only been recently discovered and are also expressed in multiple cell types [11,12,13,14]. In this review we will focus on the roles of type I IFNs as they are crucial, ubiquitously expressed components of the antiviral response in mammals. ",

            "text": "In the context of viral infections, the type I IFN response is activated by sensing the presence of invading viruses. These pathogens pose a particular challenge for detection by the innate immune system due to their small size and constantly evolving surface protein repertoire, therefore, host cells have developed the ability to recognize virus-specific nucleic acid signatures. These sensing mechanisms rely on host proteins termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizing specific pathogen features, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). During viral infections, PRRs need to appropriately discriminate between non-self, viral-derived nucleic acids and self-derived nucleic acids (Table 1) [15,16]. The binding and recognition of virus-specific nucleic acids by PRRs is necessary for the production and secretion of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secreted type I IFN proteins act in an auto- and paracrine fashion by binding to the heterodimeric type I IFN receptors, IFNAR1 and 2, on the surface of the infected and neighboring cells. This initiates the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway that activates a second transcriptional response of around 500 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which establishes the antiviral state [17,18]. These processes constitute the first steps of the innate immune response to infections prior to activation of the adaptive immune system. Here we focus on the mechanisms that cells use to detect invasion by viruses. ",

MyD88 activates the MAPK pathway, NF\u03baB, and IRF7 transcription factors to induce expression of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines [22,23]. TLR3, on the other hand, signals through TRIF to activate the MAPK, NF\u03baB, and IRF3 pathways to induce the expression of similar cytokines [24].",

RIG-I and MDA5 bind a complementary set of viral RNA ligands: MDA5 binds long dsRNA, whereas RIG-I binds 5\u2032tri- and diphosphate short dsRNA [27,28,29]. Binding of ligands occurs at the basic cleft in their C-terminal domains (CTD) which leads to a conformational change to expose the occluded CARD domain [30,31]. This causes RIG-I to form tetramers and short filaments and MDA5 to oligomerize and form long filaments along the length of the dsRNA [32,33]. After filament formation, the CARD domains of both MDA5 and RIG-I interact with the CARD domain of MAVS to promote further signaling [34,35]. MAVS activation causes NF-kB, IRF3, and IRF7 transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus and initiate type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression [36,37] (Figure 1). LGP2, which lacks a CARD domain, seems to regulate both RIG-I and MDA5 activity. LGP2 can enhance the rate of nucleation and consequent filament formation by MDA5 [38,39], whereas it inhibits RIG-I-mediated signaling by competing for the same RNA substrates [40]. Thus, the third RLR can act both as a positive or negative factor for antiviral signaling [41,42,43].",

Unlike unmodified dsRNAs, the presence of inosine residues prevents activation of the innate immune response, while still being bound to RLRs. Consequently, the absence of deaminase activity inhibits the cell\u2019s ability to discriminate \u201cself\u201d from \u201cnon-self\u201d and results in the undesired activation of a type I IFN response [53,54].

            "text": "miRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA-polymerase II as long precursor molecules (pri-miRNAs) that can be organized in clusters, indicating that a single transcript is sufficient to produce different miRNAs [58,59]. Pri-miRNAs adopt stem-loop structures that are recognized and cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, which consists of the RNAse III endonuclease Drosha associated with two copies of the dsRNA binding protein DiGeorge syndrome chromosomal region 8 (DGCR8) [60,61,62,63,64,65] (Figure 2). DGCR8, interacting with the apical part of the pri-miRNA hairpin, guides Drosha binding and cleavage at the base of the hairpin, releasing a ~60\u201370 nt hairpin with a 2-nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang [62,65,66,67]. Besides the typical RNA secondary structure of pri-miRNAs, specific sequence motifs determine successful processing. Efficiently processed pri-miRNAs harbor a 5\u2032 UG motif at the basal junction, a UGU motif at the apical loop, a mismatched GHG motif in the 3\u2032 stem region, and a 3\u2032 flanking CNNC motif [65,66,68,69]. Microprocessor processing efficiency is also regulated by additional auxiliary factors that enhance or inhibit its cleavage activity on specific pri-miRNAs [70]. After microprocessor processing, the cleaved hairpin structure (pre-miRNA) is transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 [71,72], where further processing by the RNAse III endonuclease Dicer takes place. Cleavage of pre-miRNAs by Dicer produces the mature miRNA duplex of 20\u201324 nt length, containing 2-nucleotides 3\u2032 overhangs on both strands [73,74,75,76]. Only one strand of this duplex, the guide strand, is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to inhibit expression of the target mRNA [77,78,79] (Figure 2). In mammals, four different Ago proteins are expressed and associate with miRNAs (Ago 1\u20134) [80,81], of which only Ago2 and Ago3 have retained endonuclease activity [82,83]. The additional co-factors TRBP and PACT in humans, and Loquacious (Loqs) in D. melanogaster, are necessary for successful Dicer-mediated miRNA processing and formation of the RISC complex [84,85,86,87,88,89].",

            "text": "Apart from its role in miRNA biogenesis, Dicer is essential for the production of siRNAs in chordates and non-chordates (Figure 2). Cytoplasmic processing of endogenous dsRNAs derived from sense and antisense transcripts or long stem-loop structures by Dicer generates mature siRNAs that are also loaded into the RISC complex [102,103,104]. Unlike miRNAs, the full complementarity between siRNAs and the target activates Ago2 endonucleolytic activity and degradation of the target RNA [82,83,105]. In mammals, endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) have been reported in mouse embryonic stem cells and oocytes. In stem cells, endo-siRNAs originate from repetitive elements (SINEs, short interspersed elements) [102], and in oocytes, endo-siRNAs have been shown to control the expression of both mRNAs and retrotransposons [106,107]. In comparison to non-vertebrate organisms such as C. elegans [108,109,110] or D. melanogaster [103,104,111], it is still unclear how widespread the synthesis and function of endo-siRNAs in mammals is. Initially, mammals were not considered to produce siRNAs, since the presence of dsRNAs in the cytoplasm could trigger a type I IFN response. Noticeably, the cellular models where mammalian endo-siRNAs have been reported have an inherently attenuated IFN response [112,113,114,115].",

            "text": "One of the components of the microprocessor complex, Drosha, shows direct antiviral activity against RNA viruses and engineered chimeric viral genomic RNAs containing human derived pri-miRNA sequences, or well-characterized viral DNA pri-miRNA structures [123,124,125,126]. This activity requires Drosha translocating from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, since most of the replication cycle of RNA viruses is restricted to this compartment [124,125,126]. However, RNA viruses rarely encode microprocessor-dependent miRNAs. Considering that microprocessor cleavage of viral RNAs could impact the steady-state levels of the viral genomes, the potential benefit for RNA viruses to encode miRNAs is still unclear. Efforts to address this issue have shown that, unexpectedly, cleavage of the viral genome by Drosha has a negligible effect on viral fitness [123,127], suggesting that only a small proportion of the total of viral RNA is available for miRNA processing. However, opposite results have been obtained in the context of lentiviral vectors containing microprocessor-dependent pri-miRNA substrates [128]. A recent characterization of Drosha function on natural RNA viruses unveiled that its antiviral activity is independent of RNA cleavage function, and DGCR8 or Dicer factors. Instead, the binding of Drosha to the viral RNA hinders viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase activity during replication (Figure 2). This direct antiviral role is not limited to mammalian Drosha and it is suggested to be conserved in other eukaryotes, including fish, plants, and arthropods [129]. ",

It is unclear how the biogenesis of viral miRNAs affects the abundance and stability of the precursor viral transcripts. DNA viruses restrict the expression of miRNAs to specific viral genes and during certain stages of their lifecycle, such as in latency, a mechanism that may have evolved to avoid a general downregulation of the viral transcripts throughout the whole virus replication cycle.

The relevance of RNA interference (RNAi) as an antiviral mechanism in fungi, invertebrates, and plants is well established [138,139,140,141,142], since disruption of any of the critical components of the RNAi response renders these organisms highly susceptible to viral infection. Even though mammals express all the necessary components for RNAi, it has proven difficult to establish whether this pathway acts as a functionally relevant antiviral mechanism. Research into the role of antiviral RNAi in mammalian cells has been confounded by seemingly contradicting results. Deep sequencing experiments on a wide range on viruses failed to detect, or only detected very low levels of virus-derived siRNAs [143,144,145,146,147,148]. Despite these observations, a functional antiviral activity of RNAi in mammalian cells was first presented in the papers by Li and Maillard [149,150] where antiviral siRNAs were detected from both strands of the virus, and blocking the RNAi pathway increased viral replication.

            "text": "Classical RNAi organisms are characterized by Dicer gene duplications, with specific and non-interchangeable isoforms specialized in the production of siRNAs or miRNAs [142,151]. For instance, D. melanogaster Dicer-2 is specialized in siRNA biogenesis and antiviral defense, whereas Dicer-1 is restricted to miRNA biogenesis [141]. Instead, mammals have retained a single copy of Dicer responsible for both mi- and siRNA biogenesis [73,152]. Comparative functional analyses of Dicer proteins revealed that human Dicer only partially rescues antiviral defense in flies, suggesting that human Dicer is less efficient at cleaving dsRNA [153]. Deletion of the N-terminal helicase domain of human Dicer increases its ability to process dsRNA [154]. Furthermore, a specific Dicer isoform lacking the N-terminal domain is expressed in mouse oocytes, which explains their proficiency to generate siRNAs from both endogenous and exogenous dsRNAs [155]. Similarly, the expression of an N-terminal truncated form of Dicer during viral infections enhances detection of viral derived siRNAs in mammalian cells [146]. All these suggest that mammals have retained certain Dicer antiviral activity. Supporting these findings, mutations in viral factors encoding for suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) also improved antiviral siRNA detection, suggesting that viruses have developed mechanisms to counteract RNAi in mammals. Examples of mammalian VSRs include the N protein from coronaviruses, NS1 from Influenza A virus, 3A from human enterovirus 71, and VP35 from Ebola virus, amongst others [148,149,156,157,158].",

            "text": "During homeostasis, miRNAs regulate a large number of genes involved in the IFN response, which suggests that dysregulation of miRNA expression can lead to incorrect levels of these and other cytokines. Importantly, the unbalanced production of IFNs and pro-inflammatory molecules are at the root of human disorders, including autoimmune disease, inflammation, and cancer [164,165]. To ensure correct regulation of the IFN response, miRNAs target genes involved in different stages of the IFN response pathway, including the PRRs, transduction proteins, and transcription factors [166,167,168]. This homeostatic regulation is considered to act as a general dampening down of the IFN response that needs to be de-repressed following its activation. In agreement, in the absence of miRNAs by depletion of Dicer in microglia, endometrial, and thymic cells, spontaneous expression of IFNs is observed in the absence of infection [169,170,171]. Remarkably, ISGs also seem to be more significantly regulated by miRNAs than housekeeping genes [172]. Besides this global de-repression, there are also a number of miRNAs whose expression is induced by the IFN response. miR-146 and miR-155 are IFN-induced miRNAs that act as negative feedback loop molecules to shut-down the IFN response [173,174]. These and other miRNAs target components of the IFN response, such as TLR-receptors and the signaling molecules TRAF6, IRAK1, and 2 [175,176], but are also found to directly target cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [177,178].",

Stimulation of cells with the viral mimic dsRNA and activation of IFN expression regulates the processing of pri-miRNAs by the microprocessor. This inhibition leads to a transient depletion of specific miRNAs, which is necessary to robustly express IFN- \u03b2 and initiate the antiviral response [179]. Along these lines, type I IFNs diminish Dicer expression levels [180] and Dicer cleavage activity [181]. However, the exact mechanism by which the type I IFN response impairs both Drosha and Dicer cleavage activities is still unknown. In the case of the microprocessor, the activation of IFN expression reduces the binding affinity of DGCR8 to its substrates [179]. In the case of Dicer, the RLR LGP2 has been found to compete for Dicer binding to its substrates during the antiviral response [182]. Other factors involved in the recognition of dsRNA, such as ADAR, can also modulate the function of Drosha and Dicer proteins. ADAR1 associates to Dicer to enhance its mi-/si-RNA mediated processing [183], whereas ADAR-mediated editing of pri-miRNAs inhibits both Drosha and Dicer cleavage activity [184,185].",

Rapid impairment of small RNA biogenesis and RISC function during the activation of the type I IFN response may be necessary for robust ISG expression and establishment of the antiviral state. This is further supported by reports that show mammalian embryonic stem cells and embryonic carcinoma cells have a much better developed RNAi response compared to somatic cells. These cells inherently lack a functional IFN response [196], and are able to process long dsRNA into functional siRNAs [197,198]. Furthermore, RNAi activity in ESCs targeting either endogenous transposable elements [106] or viruses is more pronounced [150]. The shutdown of the IFN response in somatic cells enables the processing of long dsRNA into functional RNAi and inhibits replication of virus with the cognate sequence [199]. However, naturally derived siRNAs can still be detected, to an extent, in IFN-proficient cell lines [158]. All these suggest the presence of a competition between the small RNA biogenesis factors and the type I IFN response when co-occurring in the same cell type. ",

Despite similar growth rates, knock-down of Dicer protein levels resulted in a variable increase in cell migration and spontaneous IFN-\u03b2 expression, which correlated with the accumulation of unprocessed pre-miRNAs in the cytoplasm [169]. This variation likely reflects the involvement of different miRNAs in the regulation of the IFN response and in variations of Dicer knock-down levels combined with cell-specific characteristics. This paper also showed that knocking down Dicer by shRNAs might be efficient, but not sufficient to completely impair miRNA biogenesis. Surprisingly, knock-down of Drosha in the same cell lines did not result in IFN-\u03b2 induction, suggesting that accumulation of unprocessed pre-miRNAs in the cytoplasm might accidently trigger the IFN response [169]. The same was found in HEK293 cells where the knock-down of Dicer, but not Drosha, resulted in the upregulation of IFN and accumulation of dsRNA, probably from retrotransposon origin [217]. ",

Interestingly, infections with five different viruses showed no differences in viral replication, only a significant increase in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus replication. Further investigation found Dicer-deficient mice to be hypersensitive to VSV infection due to the absence of specific miRNAs directly targeting the VSV genome, but not to changes in the IFN response [223]. In a later report, a direct link between the IFN response and loss of miRNA regulation was found using the same mouse strain and herpesvirus infection. Dicer hypomorph mice and isolated macrophages were hypersensitive to mouse Cytomegalovirus (mCMV) and despite the upregulation of IFN dependent genes, the ISG response was impaired after infection. The authors concluded that a rapid and transient de-repression of the miRNA regulated IFN response genes is necessary for a functional antiviral response [224]. This was further confirmed in our recent publication, where a short-lived downregulation of specific miRNAs was observed during the activation of the IFN response and was found to be necessary for robust IFN expression and consequent antiviral activity [179].",

A reduction in VSV replication was found and attributed to an increased expression of the host antiviral response. This was supported by the observation that the same infections in IFN-negative mice nullified the difference in replication [143,209]. It should be noted that this result was obtained from in vivo infections in mice but could not be recapitulated in vitro with fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages [143].

Knocking out Dicer in HEK293T cells results in a considerable reduction in proliferation [226], a relevant observation for these experiments since the availability and speed of the cellular machinery may have a major impact on viral replication. Furthermore, manipulations of small RNAs are also likely to influence the expression of cellular receptors and entry mechanisms on which viruses rely to initiate infections. Conclusions driven by these cellular models will benefit from relatively simple controls, such as binding and entry assays, when comparing viral infections in these profoundly different cell lines.",

            "text": "Similar experiments in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have addressed the role of small RNAs and their biogenesis factors during the antiviral response. ESCs have the unique ability to indefinitely self-renew and give raise to any tissue of the adult organism. Early stages of development, including pre-implantation blastocysts from which ESCs are derived, suppress the type I IFN response, suggesting an incompatibility between pluripotency and this antiviral pathway [196,227]. Another interesting aspect of ESCs is that, unlike somatic cells, they are able to cleave and process viral derived long perfect dsRNA using Dicer [154,155,228]. As observed in somatic cells, the loss of Dicer in ESCs results in a delayed cell cycle progression and an increase in apoptosis [228]. These are accompanied by a significant de-repression of retrotransposable element expression and an increased expression of genes involved in immunological responses [229,230]. Recent findings by our group have confirmed that the disruption of miRNAs in ESCs has huge consequences for the cell\u2019s innate immune responses. The disruption of either Dicer or Dgcr8 expression in mouse ESCs leads to a decrease in susceptibility to TMEV and IAV infections. Interestingly, the decrease in susceptibility was larger in the absence of Dgcr8 compared to Dicer, corroborating that Dicer might have additional antiviral roles, as previously suggested in the antiviral RNAi response [150]. Knocking out miRNA function provided ESCs with the ability to activate the IFN response by increasing the expression of the central factor for RNA immunity, MAVS [231]. Therefore, miRNAs, and more specifically, miR-673, was suggested to be central to silence the type I IFN response during pluripotency.",

The overall effect of impairing small RNA biogenesis on the host\u2019s antiviral response is difficult to predict, as small RNAs are responsible for silencing the IFN response, but at the same time are required to establish a robust antiviral state. Another layer of complexity is added by the observation that some miRNAs can directly target viral sequences, whereas others increase viral fitness. Integrating all these processes will be the key in providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between small RNAs and the type I IFN response. ",
