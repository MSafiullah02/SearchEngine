Professional societies have an influence on the development and implementation of ethical codes of conduct and play an important role in the education of their members. Publishers have the final decisive power on whether scientific results are promulgated to the scientific community and the wider public. National governments make decisions on research funding and legal controls regarding potentially dangerous materials and technologies. International bodies, such as the WHO, finally, can build global policies with respect to the threat of bioterrorism and biowarfare.

In contrast to DURC, a term which is typically used for issues of biosecurity as the deliberate misuse of science for malevolent purposes (see, for example, NSABB definition above), GOFR is discussed with respect to both: biosecurity and biosafety [16, 17]. The scientific and public debates on GOFR were particularly triggered after the US Government had initiated a pause of funding research on dangerous pathogens (such as influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses) in 2014. This governmental decision was mainly driven by a series of biosafety mishaps in the sense of human exposure to pathogens or inadvertent contamination of viral samples. Whereas issues of biosafety are linked with a number of highly relevant ethical questions [17, 18] this article\u2019s focus will be on the biosecurity debate, so on the deliberate misuse of scientific data, products or technologies, which is typically discussed in the context of DURC.",

State oversight mechanisms can include legal regulations, such as the US Patriot Act and the Bioterrorism Act, which control the access, transfer and storage of potentially dangerous biological, chemical or radiological materials [20]. On the international level, multilateral treaties, such as the Geneva Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), ban the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons and promote their destruction from a global perspective [21]. However concrete suggestions for the national level are missing in this multilateral treaty. An obvious drawback of governmental regulation lies in the fact that it might pose a significant threat to academic freedom [22]. The value of academic freedom can be principally depicted as both, an intrinsic as well as an instrumental good. Evans, however, has convincingly shown that referring to scientific freedom as a good for its own sake can fail with respect to DURC when it has to be critically weighed against the public good of preventing mass casualties [23]. Instrumental appeals to scientific freedom are limited as well, for example because scientific principles such as the confirmation of results can often be achieved without full transparency about potentially dangerous aspects of the research [23].",

Similar to other biomedical developments, extensive discussions on how to regulate DURC started only rather recently in Germany. The situation is shaped by two partly competing suggestions: The German Ethics Council, an independent political advisory body to the Bundestag and Federal Government, suggested a series of measures, including a national legislation on DURC [14]. Competing with that, the National Academy of Sciences and the German Research Foundation, two major professional bodies, made a suggestion which draws on the self-control of science and, inter alia, suggests expanding the scope of existing research ethics committees (RECs) to an evaluation of DURC [25]. This ambiguous situation is taken as an occasion to further analyze the scope and limits of professional self-control in dealing with potentially dangerous research. An exemplary focus addresses the role of RECs in assessing DURC. The critical evaluation of the subjects will be conducted from the perspective of professionalism, which, as a sociological concept, is applied to RECs as bodies of professional self-governance which deal with ethical issues.",

Firstly, the \u2018ethical dilemma framing\u2019 does not mirror the way in which the dual use issue is experienced and responded to by the scientific community. If scientists and institutions do not experience a \u2018dilemma\u2019, they are likely to remain ignorant regarding potential issues of concern. As any attempts to DURC regulation and governance finally aim for the prevention of potentially fatal events, the \u2018dilemma framing\u2019 does not serve as a useful strategy when it fails to motivate the relevant stakeholders. Secondly, speaking of a \u2018dilemma\u2019 may require broader political negotiations of the structures and practices of biotechnology. If dual-use issues are primarily discussed case by case as a series of dilemmas, this might hinder the politics of governing DURC in the long-term, which should instead function anticipatorily and at a higher political level. Describing DURC as an ethical dilemma, therefore, does not always contribute to the building of adequate policies which are successful and accepted by the relevant stakeholders. Finally, from a more theoretical perspective, the problem of DURC deviates from traditional notions of a \u2018dilemma\u2019: Problems of DURC regulation usually do not appear in the sense that we have to decide about either being fully permissive with respect to research practice and publication or being advocates of a complete prohibition of such research. Instead, complex evaluations are necessary which have to carefully consider each individual case of research conduct, also with respect to its legal, ethical and social implications.",

The PP as a conceptual tool is usually applied to guide decision-making in risk management. A canonical formulation of this principle is, however, missing. A common feature of all attempts to explicate the PP lies in the fact that they advance precaution in some way. However, the formulas differ in their concrete content and relationship to cost-benefit analysis as another tool for the assessment of risk [32]. The PP can be usefully applied regarding DURC, especially concerning aspects of raising awareness and the establishment of routines which ensure that research is not misused for harmful purposes [8]. Furthermore, it has been argued that the PP is particularly suited for the assessment of situations which are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty [32]. In contrast to risk, uncertain situations are those in which the probability of possible outcomes cannot be quantified on the basis of reliable evidence [33]. As most practical situations contain aspects of risk as well as of uncertainty, a combination of the PP with a cost-benefit analysis is a promising approach, also regarding research which carries the potential of being misused. Applying the PP in an isolated and inflexible way, by contrast, runs the danger of promoting conservative or restrictive options to the disadvantage of a nuanced evaluation of all available evidence on chances and challenges.",

Physicians and the medical system usually serve as paradigm cases for professionalism in the sociological literature [34, 35]. In contrast to a mere occupation or job, professions are characterized by certain features, structures or functions in society which are analyzed extensively by the sociology of the professions as a scientific subdiscipline. Professions can be traced back historically to the guilds, which were the major organizations for skilled work in the Middle Ages. The guilds served for a public good (the permanent and reliable provision of products and services) and, simultaneously, maintained comfortable working conditions and a high income for their members [36]. Professional organizations, replacing the guilds in modern times, are still powerful at regulating highly important social goods, for example, medical services and research. Compared to clinical medicine, there is a scarcity of literature explicitly addressing biomedical science as a profession [37]. However, the sociology of scientific knowledge, as a related field, highlights the character of science as a social activity and describes the construction of biomedical knowledge through functional and critical analyses of the related occupations [38, 39].",

Even the call for a \u2018Hippocratic Oath for Scientists\u2019 has been raised and discussed vividly [44\u201346]. Codes of professional conduct have been suggested as one measure to minimize biosecurity risks in the context of DURC in the recent debates on security-related research [12, 14].

Professional authority is the basis upon which society confers certain rights to the profession for self-control.

The scope and limits of self-control are under continual discussion, for example, regarding the professional organizations\u2019 right to advance ethically controversial positions [47, 48]. With respect to the current debates on DURC, professional organizations in different countries have stressed that they regard self-governance of science as the most effective means of managing the risks of misuse [13, 49].

The committee is composed of senior researchers from biomedical sciences, social science, law and theology. In their 2014 recommendations, the two organizations claim jointly that research institutions should define ethics rules for handling security-relevant research and that there should be a specialized REC to advise on issues arising from the implementation of such rules [49]. It is suggested in a subsequent document (\u2018Progress Report\u2019) from October 2016 that extending the responsibilities of ethics committees already existing would be one option for assessing DURC [25]. By now (March 2018) both options \u2013 building new and specialized committees or using the already established committees \u2013 have been realized by German research institutions. Furthermore, there are research institutions which are still in their planning phase and others which do not plan to initiate an internal DURC assessment.

The German Ethics Council provides a thorough analysis of empirical, ethical and legal issues related to DURC. It suggests a bundle of measures to prevent the misuse of dangerous knowledge, products or technologies. The level of awareness is supposed to be raised by introducing the respective topics in academic education, training and public discourse. Furthermore, a national biosecurity code of conduct shall be developed including, for example, regulations on the funding, planning and execution of biosecurity-relevant research. Finally \u2013 and divergent from the two main professional bodies characterized above \u2013 the German Ethics Council pleads for legally binding regulations on DURC, which include a legal definition and the obligatory consultation of a DURC commission which operates on a national level. Several members of the German Ethics Council even suggested the implementation of a Federal authority to approve suspected DURC on an obligatory basis [14]. Thus, the German Ethics Council, as a political advisory body, supports measures of self-regulation and awareness-raising within the scientific community, but, at the same time, does not exclude legal measures operating in parallel. In the remainder of the paper, whether such a \u2018double-tracked\u2019 solution emerges as necessary or whether professional self-regulation alone bears enough potential to prevent the misuse of science will be discussed.",

The legal situation, for example, is far from clear regarding the juridical basis for assessing security-related research or the liability of committee members and the institutional providers. In addition to this, an unfavorable \u2018mission creep\u2019 of RECs can be suspected if their spectrum of tasks is widened to DURC-related issues [52]. Albeit these and other points deserve further attention, there is, so far, a scarcity of literature on the suitability of RECs to assess suspect DURC research or to include a public security-related viewpoint in their \u2018portfolio\u2019 [26, 53]. David Resnik comes to the conclusion that RECs should not be burdened with the responsibility of conducting dual use reviews [53]. Instead, he suggests separate dual use or institutional biosafety committees. From Resnik\u2019s point of view, the major task of RECs is the protection of human subjects, and too much extraneous responsibility should be avoided. He argues that \u2018Broader social or political issues should be resolved through legislation or administrative policy-making, not through IRB review [53].\u2019",

            "text": "In addition to these important arguments, the perspective from professionalism taken in this article sheds a new light on the role of RECs in assessing security-related research. As argued before, RECs embody two major traits associated with professionalism: They represent the ethical orientation within professional conduct and, simultaneously, form important bodies regarding professional self-control. Both aspects, which are used fruitfully in the assessment of \u2018usual\u2019 biomedical research, can, however, be challenged with respect to DURC. The ethical orientation of a profession is directed towards its clients as well as towards the entire society. Orientation towards public welfare thus forms a key trait of professionalism. Professional organizations maintain certain privileges against external forces, while simultaneously ensuring a high quality of services. Regulations, such as those included in professional codes of ethics, are addressed predominantly to members of the profession and sanction deviant behavior within the community. This function of professional ethics, however, contrasts with certain aspects of the regulation of DURC, which could now be required from RECs as professional bodies: The aim of providing good services to clients and society is considerably expanded if RECs are supposed to deal with major security threats. Measures to prevent the abuse of research are not exclusively directed towards members of the professional community (which could, however, happen in case of criminal colleagues), but towards outsiders who use research information, technologies or products for their illegal and highly dangerous purposes. The boundaries of professional ethics are, therefore, markedly transgressed if RECs are used to assess and regulate biosecurity-related issues.",

            "text": "A second key component of professionalism, as depicted above, lies in the professionals\u2019 right to independently regulate issues which form part of their field of expertise. The assessment of suspect DURC research, however, can only partly be seen as falling under this scope. The RECs are composed of experienced researchers, including bioscientists, lawyers and ethicists. They, thus, possess a range of competences which are helpful to understand and estimate, for example, biological backgrounds, chances and challenges, and the research practice of certain experiments. Furthermore, they can assess the compliance with legal regulations and can deal with other \u2018traditional\u2019 tasks of research ethics, such as the protection of subjects and risk-benefit analyses. What is missing, however, are specific competencies needed to deal with terroristic threats or biowarfare. Scientists may not always be able to classify research appropriately as being a threat to security. There has not been any established connection to national security agencies and the respective political bodies so far, and it remains doubtful whether top secret information regarding national interests or terrorist threats can be easily shared with RECs at scientific institutions. Finally, a conflict of interest may arise between the scientists\u2019 interest in promoting research and their responsibility to prevent harmful misuse of science [19, 26]. Researchers have a genuine professional interest in advancing knowledge and, in addition, form part of a system which puts them under considerable pressure regarding, for example, presenting new results and publishing. Tensions may arise between the legitimate impetus of knowledge acquisition and the orientation towards public welfare as another key trait of professionalism. Deciding whether a suspect DURC study should be carried out transcends the boundaries of the scientific community in many respects and, in the worst case, can have catastrophic consequences for major parts of the population. It is, therefore, particularly important to weigh the expected gain of knowledge carefully and impartially against the possible consequences, even if they appear unlikely.",

Both are important values which, in liberal states, must only be restricted for important reasons. The threats, however, emanating from experiments, such as the reconstruction of a lethal virus, or from technologies which render vaccinations ineffective, could lead to catastrophic events. The level of risk in each case of DURC depends on a variety of different factors which must be evaluated carefully. Among these factors are not only the potential for being used as a weapon and the expertise and equipment needed for misuse [11], but also the political situation and the likelihood of terrorist attacks. A comprehensive assessment encompassing scientific and social and political factors cannot be performed by RECs alone, but requires an extensive strategy including measures of professional self-control as well as aspects of state and international oversight.",

More concretely, research institutions could initiate undergraduate and graduate curricula on biosecurity, the respective training for staff members and further the exchange between scientific and public discourse. Measures like these have been suggested by the German Ethics Council [14] and, in fact, they might be most powerful in preventing the deliberate misuse of research results, technologies or products for harmful purposes. Activities like these can be considered as concrete implementations of ethical orientation which forms a key trait of professionalism. In addition, professional self-control could extend to interdisciplinary committees which offer collegial advice to those researchers who, by themselves, see a \u201cdual use\u201d potential in their research. These intra-professional ways of dealing with biosecurity risks, however, should not be seen as substitutes for legal regulation in high risk fields of research. The argument from scientific freedom, in many cases, has a limited power in light of the pragmatic circumstances of scientific work and its dissemination [23]. It can thus not be brought forward in general to limit DURC governance to scientific self-control which is, for the reasons demonstrated above, as a context not sufficient for dealing with high-risk DURC.",

A slightly closer look, however, at the foundations of professional ethics and self-control reveals that assessment through RECs as professional bodies might not be appropriately suited to evaluate and, finally, prevent the abuse of scientific knowledge, products or technologies for terroristic or warfare activities.
