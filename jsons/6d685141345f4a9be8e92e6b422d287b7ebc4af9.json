Methods and Results: An antimicrobial coating based on polymer-encapsulated ClO 2 was developed. A low viscosity, water \u2044 oil \u2044 water double emulsion coating was formulated for easy on-site application. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were applied onto the coating to study the bactericidal capabilities of the coating. The bactericidal performance of the coating increased when the contact time with the tested bacteria increased. Over 99% of the E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa, B. subtilis were killed with a contact time of 30 min. Although endospores of B. subtilis are more resistant, about 75% of the spores were killed after 72 h on the coating. Moreover, a sustained release of gaseous ClO 2 was achieved to maintain about 90% removal of B. subtilis with a 10-min contact time during a 28-day study period. The coating also exhibits antiadhesive properties against bacteria. Conclusions: A polymer-encapsulated ClO 2 coating with sustained release of ClO 2 and promising bactericidal and sporicidal features was tested for 28 days. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides a new direction for developing polymer-encapsulated ClO 2 coatings that possess persistent bactericidal and sporicidal properties.",

            "text": "Micro-organisms are ubiquitous in our environment. Although many are harmless and even beneficial, some are well-known pathogens while others can elicit allergic responses in humans. Casual contact with surfaces and objects contaminated with infectious droplets (i.e. fomites) is an established route for transmission of many diseases (Pruss et al. 1999) . Maintaining clean and pathogen-free surfaces is necessary in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Metal surfaces containing silver, copper and brass possess intrinsic germicidal properties that can kill many pathogenic micro-organisms upon contact. They are commonly known as 'contact-killing' surfaces (Fang 1997; Block 2001) . Similarly, chromium and nickel in stainless steel and zinc in galvanized iron are known to inhibit microbial growth (Fang 1997) . Nanosilvers (Fu et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2007) , photocatalytic TiO 2 (Sunada et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2007 ) and surface-tethered bactericides (e.g. quarternary ammonium compounds, phosphonium salts) (Isquith et al. 1972; Cen et al. 2003; Popa et al. 2003 ) are among the new generation of contactkilling, antimicrobial surface coatings developed in recent years. Nonmetals such as ceramics and enamels whose surfaces are physically nonadhesive and resist biofilm formation are also extensively used in sanitary settings. Microbes adhere poorly to ultra-hydrophobic surfaces and bacteria-repelling poly(ethylene glycol) (Desai et al. 1992) . However, the antimicrobial properties of these materials diminish rapidly when the surface is fouled by dirt and contaminants, thus requiring frequent cleaning to maintain their effectiveness.",

For example, a chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ) biocide is generated from the reaction between stored sodium chlorite salt and acids released from a polymer matrix by either hydrolysis or photolysis reactions (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997) . The latest developments in new antimicrobial coatings are oriented towards multiple mechanistic approaches for surface disinfection. Cohen's group (Li et al. 2006) employed layer-by-layer, self-assembly methods to produce antibacterial coatings capable of both release-killing and contact-killing based on stored silver salts and surfacegrafted quarternary ammonium. Ho et al. (2004) used a polymer film to immobilize nanosilver to achieve both contact-and release-killing effects, while a grafted layer of polyethylene glycol repelled the adhesion of bacteria.",

Released as a gas, the antimicrobial action of ClO 2 is less affected by dirt and surface fouling. The gaseous ClO 2 was originally used for large-scale disinfection by bottling companies and as a replacement for the more toxic chlorine in drinking water treatment.

The glass was cut into 2AE5 \u00b7 2AE5 cm 2 pieces and prepared according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) guideline (2005a). Any defective glass was eliminated and the remaining substrates were rinsed once with distilled water and thrice with ethanol (99AE9%; Merck) followed by another rinse with excess amounts of distilled water. The glasses were then sterilized in an autoclave (Hirayama, HA-300P) at 121\u00b0C for 20 min. Next, 60 ll of the formulation was coated on the cleaned glass to give a coating of about 1 mg ClO 2 cm )2 loading. The uniformity of the coating was ensured by the good wettability of the P123 \u2044 F127 surfactant polymers used in the formulation. Cleaned glass pieces without any coating (uncoated) served as the control.",

Bellamy et al. (1998 found amylase from saliva on close to 29% of exposed surfaces in domestic households. Human expiratory droplets and hence any inherent pathogens or embedded bacteria can settle on surfaces for days. Fomites, inanimate surfaces capable carrying germs, had been associated with contact transmission of viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. Regular surface cleaning and disinfection are therefore important and recommended for breaking the chain of transmission. Chemical disinfectants are commonly employed for maintaining the cleanliness of surfaces. The oxidizing biocide, ClO 2 , is a common disinfectant. It is safe (McDonnel and Russell 1999) and effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, spores and viruses over a wide pH range from 2 to 8 (Huang et al. 1997; Young and Setlow 2003; Sy et al. 2005; Simonet and Gantzer 2006) . The disinfection ability of ClO 2 has also been reported for B. anthrax cells and spores (Canter et al. 2005) , the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (Wang et al. 2005 ) and the influenza A virus (H1N1) (Ogata and Shibata 2005) . ClO 2 is a very reactive free radical molecule. Owing to its unique oneelectron transfer reaction mechanism, it is also a highly selective oxidant (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005) . It attacks electron-rich centres in organic molecules (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005) and kills micro-organisms through oxidizing their cell membranes (Berg et al. 1986 ) and denaturing their proteins (Ogata 2007) . It breaks the inner membrane of spores preventing their proper germination (Young and Setlow 2003) and reacts with the viral envelope to cause irreparable damage and inactivation (Ogata and Shibata 2005) . ClO 2 solution can be applied or sprayed directly onto the target surface for action. The disinfection ability, however, diminishes with time in terms of minutes as the ClO 2 vaporizes. In enabling a longer lasting disinfection performance, ClO 2 gas was generated from sodium chlorite salts stored in a polymer matrix through a reaction with an acid (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997) , and the acid was either stored with the salt or formed as byproduct of polymer decomposition. This process is inevitably slow as the generation of ClO 2 gas depends on the release or production of acid and its subsequent reaction with sodium chlorite.",

A stabilized ClO 2 solution was microencapsulated in the active triblock copolymers Pluronic P123 and F127 to form a stable water-in-oil-in-water (w \u2044 o \u2044 w) double emulsion (Fig. 1 ). This process does not require any acid activation to generate the ClO 2 biocide, which eliminates the need for acid storage and subsequent reactions. The Pluronic family of triblock copolymers was selected because it is safe and widely used in medicines and cosmetics (Thies 1990; Morishita et al. 2001) . Also, their responsiveness to different environmental cues such as temperature, pH and moisture has been amply demonstrated for controlled drug delivery (Tarcha 1991; Sosnik and Cohn 2004) . The emulsion was readily sprayable and with the Pluronic polymers acting as a surfactant. The emulsion droplets deposited uniformly on surfaces as shown by the SEM picture in Fig. 1b . The chemical composition of the surface indicated that the ClO 2 was completely encapsulated in the polymer matrix instead of residing on the surface layer (Fig. 1c) . The experimental results in Figs 2 and 4 indicated that ClO 2 remained encapsulated after surface coating. A slow but sustained release of ClO 2 at about 1300 lg ClO 2 g )1 day )1 from a coating area of 1 mg cm )2 loaded with 180 mg ClO 2 per gram of polymer was reported in this study. Assuming that there is a constant rate of ClO 2 release from the polymer, the coating prepared in this study can optimally last for 3 months. The P123 polymer does not favour a fast transport route via inverted micelles of encapsulates in the oil phase (Matsumoto and Kang 1989; Sela et al. 1995) . Studies showed that molecules can migrate through the oil phase without affecting the double emulsion stability (Bibette et al. 1999) . The ClO 2 encapsulated in this study is likely transported from the interior of the polymer to the peripheral surfaces via diffusion, resulting in a sustained release of ClO 2 over the 28-day study period.",

            "text": "The coating also demonstrates consistent bactericidal potential. The ClO 2 released from the coating killed over 90% of the E. coli, Ps. aerugenosa, B. subtilis, and Staph. aureus and about 10% of B. subtilis endospores with a contact time of 30 min. The amount of B. subtilis killed was comparable with that killed after exposure to 300 ppm ClO 2 solution. The relative susceptibility of B. subtilis spores and the range of bacteria killed followed with the trend reported by Russell (2003) . Gram-negative E. coli was most susceptible and endospores of B. subtilis were the least susceptible (Figs 2 and 3) . Staphylococcus aureus was the least susceptible to ClO 2 among the tested vegetative species. Staphylococcus aureus also exhibited similar low susceptibility to a hypochlorite (i.e. bleach) solution (data not shown). This may be related to the presence of carotenoid pigments in Staph. aureus that are antioxidative and provide the bacteria with some degree of protection from oxidizing biocides (Clauditz et al. 2006) . Despite the different susceptibilities of the bacteria to polymer-encapsulated ClO 2 , the bactericidal and sporicidal performance generally increased as the contact time was prolonged. This trend favours the use of the encapsulated coating as an antimicrobial surface. Under ambient conditions, droplets or fomites from whatever source will be deposited onto surfaces and remain on the site until they are transferred to other surfaces or objects after contact. This means that there is ample time for the ClO 2 to act on the species resting on the coating. We speculate that the bactericidal or sporicidal activity is caused by multiple actions of the coating. Primarily, both dissolved and gaseous ClO 2 is released through diffusion from the ClO 2 encapsulated in the polymer matrix. In addition, the coating is rehydrated by droplets or fomites upon deposition. This rehydration destabilizes the outermost membrane film of the coating, resulting in its rupture and rapid flooding of the contact area with the encapsulated ClO 2 . The release is sustained by the difference in the osmotic pressures between the exterior and interior water phases of the polymer formulation. The rehydration thus initiates the sporadic release of ClO 2 in addition to the usual release-killing mechanism employed by antimicrobial systems using ClO 2 (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997) . This sporadic release potential gives the coating the advantage of self-disinfection of areas contaminated by droplets or fomites.",

Phenotypic tolerance to oxidizing biocide can arise from biofilm formation via consumption of the biocide by the organic constituents of the biofilm (Chen and Stewart 1996) , or by a 'population-based' resistance strategy (Cochran et al. 2000) . No biofilm was observed in this reported polymeric matrix coating. The active biocide, ClO 2 , used in the formulation prevents indiscriminate reactions and rapid consumption of ClO 2 by the biofilm because of rapid diffusion (Hosni et al. 2006 ) and greater reaction selectivity (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005) . The absence of a biofilm may also be due to the antiadhesive properties of the P123 and P127 polymers that prevent the adhesion both of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. B. subtilis and E. coli) on its surface (Fig. 5) . The chance of seeding a biofilm on the coating is also reduced. The antiadhesive property of the polymers is probably related to the anchorage of the hydrophobic core of the triblock polymers on the material surface, while its hydrophilic chains form sterically stabilized barriers against adhesion in the periphery (Bridgett et al. 1992) . The antiadhesive property of the coating surface reduces the chance of the coating degeneration as a result of biofilm formation and allows the coating surface to be a self-maintaining bactericidal system.",

The coating is easily sprayable because of its low viscosity. A sustained release of gaseous ClO 2 at a maintenance level was demonstrated for a prolonged period (i.e. 28 days). A surface concentration of about 300 ppm ClO 2 was obtained to prevent the bacteria or endospores from attaching on the coating. Contamination by droplets or fomites triggers an increased release of biocide in the affected area, resulting in rapid disinfection. The polymer-encapsulated ClO 2 coating also exhibited promising bactericidal potential against a spectrum of bacterial species and sporicidal potential against Bacillus endospores over a contact time of 60 min.",
