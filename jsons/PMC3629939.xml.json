            "text": "The role of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been demonstrated as a major viral pathogen associated with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) and frequent cause of hospitalization among children less than 5 years.1\u20134 RSV belongs to the genus Pneumovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The genome consists of nonsegmented single-stranded negative sense RNA that encodes 11 separate proteins, 8 of which are structural (L, G, F, N, P, M, M2-1, and SH) and 2 of which are nonstructural (NS1 and NS2, respectively).5,6 RSV was initially divided into 2 distinct major subgroups, A and B, using monoclonal antibodies against virus proteins.7,8 Nucleotide and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis showed that G protein is significantly more divergent than for other RSV proteins for both within and between major groups.9 Extensive nucleotide and AA variability of the G protein suggests that the virus may reinfect people and cause yearly outbreaks through escaping previously induced immunity.10,11 Extracellular domain of the membrane-bound G protein contains two hypervariable regions separated by a conserved 13 AA motif among all strains. Nucleotide mutations are preferentially accumulated in these two hypervariable regions of the ectodomain. The second hypervariable region of the G protein ectodomain located at the C terminal region provides a reliable surrogate for the variability of the entire G gene. It has been used for phylogenetical and molecular epidemiological studies of the RSV.10,12 Being as a target for neutralizing antibody as well as a major constituent for protective antibody is considered another reason for sequence study of the G protein.13 Phylogenetic analysis using G protein gene revealed that distinct genotypes consist of phyogenetically related strains.10,12 RSV group A has been clustered into 10 genotypes: GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1, and NA2.10,12,14,15 For the classification of group B, the following genotypes have been proposed: BA1-BA10, GB1-GB4, and SAB1 to SAB3.10,12,13,16,17 Determination of circulation pattern of strains is not easy because of continuous shifting in circulating strains, their multiplicity, and cocirculation during a given season.14,18\u201320 In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the genotype study and phylogenetic analysis of RSV strains. However, far too little attention has been paid to phylogenetic study of respiratory viruses in Malaysia. In the current study, we evaluated the genetic variability of the second hypervariable region of G protein gene and deduced AA sequence of both RSV A and B subgroups, detected from hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in Serdang, Malaysia.",

All potential subjects (including caregivers of the patients) were briefed on the study before written informed consent was obtained. The final selection of the subjects into the study was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Approval from the following authorities was obtained prior to the embarkation of the study: the Medical Research and Ethics committee (MREC) of the Ministry of Health Malaysia and the Medical Research Ethics Committee, University Putra Malaysia. NPAs were transported to the laboratory and refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. In order to avoid repeated freezing and thawing, all NPAs were processed upon receipt. Demographic, clinical features, hospital course, and chest X-ray findings were collected from patients; however, they were not analyzed here.",

Seminested multiplex RT-PCR was applied for the detection of a panel of respiratory viruses including RSV, HMPV, IFV types A and B, PIV1-4, and human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43 and 229E as previously reported. An internal control consisting of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was included.21 The presence of human bocavirus (HBoV) and HAdV were individually investigated in the samples by singleplex PCR and nested PCR respectively.22,23 Due to financial constrains, the samples with RSV as a sole agent detected by both methods of DFA and RT-PCR were randomly chosen and proceeded for genotyping study. The second hypervariable region at the carboxy-terminal of G gene of subgroups A and B isolates was amplified and sequenced using primer sets GPA/F1 and GPB/F1, complementary to the G and F gene nucleotide sequences, respectively.12 The GPA and GPB primers correspond to the bases 511\u2013530 and 494\u2013515 of the G gene of RSV-A prototype strains A2 and RSV-B prototype strain of 18537, respectively.

The (GTR+G) substitution model was selected using an Akaike Information Criterion as implemented in Modeltest. Bayesian Inference (BI) was carried out with MrBayes 3.028 to calculate posterior probabilities of recovered clades, with the optimal model of sequence evolution determined from the likelihood ratio test (LRT)s. MrBayes 3.0 was run with 8 \u00d7 106 generation Markov chain with trees sampled every 100th generation (resulting in 10,000 trees) using default priors. The analyses began on a random starting tree. We discarded the first 5000 trees as a conservative \u201cburn\u2013in,\u201d and the posterior probability values were calculated from the remaining trees. Stationarity was assumed when the cumulative posterior probabilities of all clades were stabilized. A cluster was defined as a bootstrap value of more than 50%.

Previously published findings have frequently confirmed RSV to be the major viral pathogen associated with ALRTI in children.1\u20133 RSV was the major reason for hospitalization of children with ALRTI in this study as it represented 50% of the NPA samples tested positive using RT-PCR of which 30% of the cases were single infections. This study is in agreement with previous local studies by Chan29 and Zamberi,30 which showed RSV as a major causative agent in Malaysian children. The results further support that RSV infection is a frequent cause of hospitalization among Human respiratory syncytial virus in Malaysia children in tropical and developing countries.4 In the majority of the RSV studies in developing countries, the prevalence of RSV associated with ALRTI was underestimated due to the application of less sensitive detection methods such as ELISA or immunofluorescence assays.31 During the 6-month study from May to November, a continuous activity of RSV was seen with a small peak in July, and then RSV activity started to increase from August to October with a relatively big peak in October. The finding seems to be consistent with RSV outbreaks during the wet season in tropical and subtropical countries with seasonal rainfall.32 However, this study only presents a small picture of the circulation pattern of the RSV genotypes in Malaysia. For a more representative result, a study spanning several years is required since variation in prevalence from year to year is common in respiratory infections.",

It was speculated that all BA genotypes with duplicated regions shared a common ancestor that was separate from other group B genotypes.13 It was classified into BA-I to BA-VI using G protein gene analysis. Rapid generation of the genetic variation among BA strains is partly related to the immunological selection at duplicated regions in the ectodomain of the G protein.

These newly introduced genotypes comprised the majority of the RSV strains from 2005 to 2010. The different methods of phylogenetic trees largely supported that UPM B strains were separated into 2 different clades, namely BA9 and BA10 genotypes. These findings of the current study are consistent with the Dapat study, which found cocirculation of several BA genotypes in all studied periods with domination of 1 genotype in each season. The present finding seems to be also consistent with other research that found BA genotypes are replacing the previously dominant RSV B genotypes.13,35 Among all RSV-B sequenced strains, residue Thr229, located outside the duplicated portion was changed to the Ile. This change was not observed in other retrieved GenBank strains without duplicated regions. This finding is in agreement with Trento et al13 who showed that T229I change occurred in all BA strains with duplicated regions. Consistence with that study, the S247P AA substitution was found in all B strains. The strains JQ933971, JQ933972, and JQ933973, which were classified in clad-included BA9 strains, had a substitution of V271A. Except for strain JQ933953, the rest of the strains clustered in the BA10 had a E292G change. Also E226D change was seen in JQ933961. The results are consistent with the study by Dapat.37 However, other changes including T289I and S269P were not observed in this study. G protein length diversity due to the position of the final stop codon was observed among RSV B strains, which leads to a deduced G protein length of 312 or 319 amino acids.",

There is remarkably good agreement between the result of pairwise distance methods and molecular trees of different methods (BI, MP, and NJ).

Host immune system evading and reinfections by RSV could be due to the within and between subgroup antigenic variations.14 The presence of emerging viruses and the lack of relative protective immunity to the new strains may facilitate effective spread of these new strains.12 The variation in the G protein length may contribute to the antigenic changes and escape from the immune system.38 However, further studies are required to determine the role of the G protein length on RSV immunity. The findings obtained in this study have important implications for the understanding of the evolutionary pattern of RSV as well as vaccine development. Previous studies have shown that genotype shifting during consecutive years is a common feature of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infections.12 However, caution must be taken as study at multiple locations and for several consecutive years with a large sample size is required to better appreciate the epidemiology of the RSV. Long-term epidemiological surveillance of RSV strains is important to illuminate antigenic and genetic bases of the infections by RSV.",
