China and in South Korea use the location data from the mobile communication providers (telcos) to identify the previous contacts. For this purpose, the whole trajectories of each person have to be stored (at least for some period, usually 2-3 weeks) and in order to enable proper post processing and detection of periods of \"past closeness\" to the trajectories of a person diagnosed sick. This approach triggers, however, in multiple societies justified concerns about the far-reaching privacy violation, in some countries such means are even forbidden by law. Approaches which might remove -or at least substantially limit the privacy violation, while offering at least equivalent identification of the past contacts are definitely needed! In answer to these concerns very recently the MIT researchers [2] have published a concept in which the trajectory of the movement is stored locally on everybody\u00b4s mobile device, and can be uploaded to a trusted cloud. A public service associated with data stored at the public cloud would make it possible to anybody to check if his trajectory has a commonality with any of the already stored trajectories of infected person. The work on that is in progress [3] .",

Therefore, the locations could be represented by semantic notions like: on the walk, during exercising, at the social meeting which meaning is entirely private to the given user and meaningless to anybody else! This strengthens additionally the privacy of location, being well known as intrinsically difficult to preserve! As for time -we have already mentioned that there is no need to keep a tight time synchronization at participating devices. The notion of the local time of the contact should be precise enough to be used -jointly with the date of test listed in the certificate -in order to decide about the point in time where a test might be useful, and length of the quarantine.

The presented approach allows for a step-wise release strategy, in which first a \"quick and semi-dirty\" but useful solution might be released, and slowly replaced by improved versions. While the basic service oriented-software architecture and the basic mechanism for data exchange establishment among the \"close\" Bluetooth devices should be set from the very beginning, multiple other algorithms can be initially implemented in a rather simplistic form and gradually replaced in later updates. Out of experience one must, however, consider that not all users will always have the newest version, so precautions for \"interoperability\" between the older and newer versions have to be taken. Let us present an example of such analysis for the algorithm making the decision if a contact is significant for spreading the infection on basis of the relative distance.",

If the owner of the device X is diagnosed sick, a proper notification will be posted, but ignored by the device Y as a fake (no matching entry in the local log). If the owner of the device Y is diagnosed sick, no notification will be posted to the device Y because there is no information about a proper contact! In both cases the newer strategy is prevailing.

In this approach such malicious claims could be misleading only if the \"joking person\" really made a \"contact\" with those to be \"wrongly alerted\". The probability of such actionespecially if everybody tries to obey social distancing is low.

For this purpose, the deployed application should be extended by a \"trusted PID\" generator, following procedure: deriving PIDs -at any time! -as a one-way hash on the record containing [personal data of the user, any arbitrary phrase invented by a user]. In case of doubt if the PID in a notification of contact with a person diagnosed sick (as proven by the certificate od infection!) has in the past REALLY been used by the claiming individual, he might be requested to prove it, by proving the knowledge of the proper phrase. Adding some personal data (easily verifiable and widely known, like first and family name) to the record used for the hash generation -as mentioned above -would prohibit \"just sharing the phrase\"! Finally, let us also indicate, that this concept could be also extended toward the defense of business owners against fake claims of visits by people tested later as infected. For this purpose, a version of application with a certified non-changeable log (e.g. following the principle described in [15] ) could be created, and customers requested to approve that the log containing their PIDs collected while patronizing the place might be published if necessary for such defense (as PIDs can be changed any time this would not be a real privacy leakage of third parties).
