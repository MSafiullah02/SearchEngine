We did not include seasonal influenza A/B, which could have been diagnosed using rapid antigen test beside RT-PCR or culture in this study. The CA-RVs tests were performed for patients with a suspicion of symptomatic CA-RVI based on the respective clinician's judgement. We excluded 3426 CA-RVs tests that were performed during the pretransplant period or in recipients who received both SOT and HSCT or re-transplantation. Thereafter, 10,616 and 3794 CA-RVs test results from SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, were finally included. The non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU had undergone 23,367 CA-RVs tests (Fig. 1\n). Repeated identical CA-RV isolation in one patient within 30 days were considered as the same infection. Therefore, the cohort included 85 (29.7%) and 61 (21.3%) CA-RVI cases in SOT and HSCT recipients, respectively, and 140 (49.0%) CA-RVI cases in non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU (Fig. 1 and Table 1\n).

Nevertheless, comprehensive data with nearly total 40,000 exclusively multiplex RT-PCR tests in our study can be seen as a strength. In addition, the data demonstrated that recipients of SOT or HSCT have different frequencies for CA-RVI compared to non-transplant critically ill patients in ICU, and these three high-risk groups with positive rates of each CA-RV in RT-PCR tests were detected on a large scale at one hospital. The data from one hospital might ensure the homogeneity of severity and consistency of laboratory tests in the study population.",
