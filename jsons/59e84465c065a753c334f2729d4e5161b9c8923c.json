The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices, social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19 like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.",

Our SD based epidemiological model explicitly captures the disease progression pathways, intervention pathways, causal linkages, and assumptions.

In 1960s and 70s, several seminal works such as Limits to Growth, Urban Dynamics, and World Dynamics emerged. More recently, the C-ROADS World Climate Policy model, developed using an SD approach to understand the long-term climate effects, has been widely adopted.",

It is a compartmental model of the pandemic, wherein the population is divided into various age group wise 'compartments' to indicate Covid-19 disease progression and the interventions. Within each compartment, population is assumed to be homogeneous without and spatial or temporal attributes. While there are a number of SIR based models (Lourenco et. all. 2020 ; Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad 2020, MedRxiv 2020), our model differs from them not just in much more detailed modeling of various stages of disease progression, but also differs in explicit modeling of quarantining and isolation of both symptomatics and asymptomatics under key interventions of Testing and Contact Tracing. We also have a much more detailed model of the healthcare subsystem that is absent in almost all other models. Unlike (Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad 2020), we do not assume any seasonality effect of temperature and humidity since the evidence on it is thin and we would rather be conservative.",

The accuracy of absolute numbers generated by the model depend greatly on how accurate structural assumptions, assumed/estimated parameters, and input data, are. As long as the parameters and input data get the relative numbers and trends right, we can compare the relative impact of various policy interventions and learn which interventions or intervention combinations are most likely to take the system to desired state. This is particularly critical when almost simultaneously estimation of number of current infections in UK from very well-respected research teams (Lourenco et. all. 2020; Ferguson et. al. 2020 ) differ by orders of magnitude. Similar order of magnitude difference in number of infections are noted for Santa Clara county in Califorina (Bendavid, et al. 2020) SD framework makes incorporating behavioral feedback possible. For example, as the number of infections cases rise, people may adopt better personal hygiene. Behavioral feedback is also important to model the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and possible policy resistance. The success of a prolonged lockdown may come at the cost of wearing people down and they may stop following any containment measures resulting in a much worse second wave of pandemic. Also, the strict Covid-containment measures may inflict high collateral damage from other diseases. The devastating economic impact of strict measures may make people desperate and more vulnerable if their health and nutritional levels suffer. Due to time pressure many such scenarios are not incorporated here but must be kept in mind when making policy choices.",

The Susceptible (S) people get exposed to the virus from contact with an infectious person. Initially all those exposed to virus are non-symptomatic and noninfectives, and become infective (but not symptomatic) only after a latency period of dEA days. After another dAI days, these individuals develop symptoms and move to Infectious Symptomatics compartment. The sum of dEA and dAI represents the average incubation period, dP. The persons in Infectious Symptomatics compartment are said to exhibit mild symptoms and are active in the community, and thus continue to transmit the virus. A fraction of such mild cases recovers, while for others, the disease worsens resulting in hospitalization (move to Hospitalised patients class). A fraction of the serious hospitalised patients recovers, while the rest become critical requiring ventilator / ICU facilities (move to Critical patients class). A fraction of the critical patients recover while the rest, unfortunately, die. It is assumed that the Recovered patients and the Dead do not transmit the virus. Note that the external seeding of the virus in the community is captured explicitly. Now, suppose quarantining and isolations of infectious persons are possible. This is explicitly captured by the flows out of the stocks A and I. The flow to the Quarantine and Isolation stocks are modeled as governed by different control fractions. The flow of asymptomatics from A to Q A represents the proportion of persons who are quarantined either through awareness efforts (represented by f 1 (t)) or contact tracing of a positive tested patients (represented by fX(t)). The flow of asymptomatics from A to L A represents the proportion of persons who are isolated after testing positive for Covid-19 though early tracing and testing effort (represented by f2(t)). The quarantined/ isolated asymptomatics, either recovers, or develop symptoms and proceed to the quarantined Symptomatic and Isolated Symptomatic stocks. The flow of Infectious Symptomatics from I to Q I represents the proportion of persons who are quarantined through awareness efforts (represented by f3(t))). The flow of symptomatics from I to L I represents the proportion of persons who are isolated after testing positive for Covid-19 (represented by f4(t)).

The spread in India is due to arrivals of infected individuals from abroad. Now, in the www.covid19india.org website (crowdsourced database available there), a few of the cases has been tagged as 'imported'. This is interpreted as those individuals who have arrived from abroad infected. Since we do not have the information on the exact arrival date to India, we assume that all these 'imported cases' came to India on an average of 7 ( + ) days prior to being identified as positive. Thus, for example, the imported patients on March 2 nd is assumed to have arrived on February 24 th . These imported cases arrivals is taken to define the flow XAR(t). Also, lockdown is taken to start on 25 th March 2020. The results of model calibration exercise is shown in Figure 3 below, for the All India data. The simulation duration was from 24 th Feb to 14 th April. It is observed that the new cases and cumulative cases give a reasonable fit to the reported data of the pandemic's spread in India. Also, observe that the simulation over estimates the number recovered and underestimate the number dead. Further calibration of recovered and dead based on current data only has a grave risk of over-estimating deaths in future since it appears that people are approaching hospitals very late when disease has progressed significantly. We assume that this scenario will change as time passes. Also, in future we plan to take comorbidity and patient case details for Indian conditions into account. It is observed that the model reasonably captures the reported trend even for changes in the calibrated values. During the initial days, the model seems to overestimate the trend. However, the more recent behaviour, especially post lockdown, is capture reasonably well. Hence, it is decided to calibrate the model with the recommended parameters.",

Do note that it is assumed that no new cases arrive at the state/ country from an external source in the above simulation time period. Figure 5 and 6 shows the simulation outputs for all India data for intervention scenarios 1A to 5B. Figure 5 shows that interventions 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, and 5B (4B and 5B overlaps in figure) are significantly more than their 'A' counterparts (all overlapping, along the x-axis). This clearly shows that increased testing and tracing and isolating has a significant impact in controlling the pandemic spread. Let's zoom in (see Figure 6 ). It can be readily observed from Figure 6 that once lockdown is lifted (any of the scenarios 1-5), the new cases reported will increase exponentially (all 'B' scenarios). The policies 2A, 4A and 5A seem to result in low spread of pandemic, with policy 4A being the least. Also, it is observed that all the 'A' policies, 1A to 5A will result in a short term increase in the number of reported cases. This is due to the larger number of cases that gets discovered initially due to increase in the testing rates. A few other policies have been evaluated (Policies 6A to 7D as mentioned in previous section). Figure 10 compares the behaviour of policy 6C, 6D, 7C and 7D with policy 4A (the best so far). It is readily apparent from the figure that policies 6C, 6D and (to some extent) 7C can help mitigate the pandemic spread. These show better projected behaviour than policy 4A. This shows that improved hygiene, social/ physical distancing, usage of masks and other protective gear can be quite effective. Unlike policy 6C (where Home, work and other contacts are at 50% and schools closed), in policy 7C only schools are closed, while home, work and others are back to 'normal'. However, the relative deterioration is only marginal between 6C and 7C (and still better than policy 4A). This again is due to improved hygiene, social/ physical distancing, usage of masks and other protective gear. The practical implementation of this policy remains to be seen. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the state-wise response to policy 6C and 7C respectively. Policy 6C (see figure 11 ) is effective in readily controlling the pandemic spread. Although policy 7C ( figure 12 ) shows an increasing rates, the growth is not exponential but asymptotic (which is a good thing, means the pandemic will not go out of control).",

Note that this factor of 1.5 is also an artificial result of the fact that we take base infectivity to be .015 from (Singh and Adhikari 2020). Any change in the base infectivity number will have a corresponding impact on the base contact correction multipliers.",

Other aspects included, which goes beyond the standard SEIR representation of Covid-19 are, the age-groups specific contacts across various contact zones or locations; age specific progression of & recovery from the disease; and explicit representation of quarantines and isolations.
