Foul-smelling expectoration is associated with anaerobic infections due to aspiration, lung abscess and necrotizing pneumonia. The presence of Gram-positive diplococci indicates pneumococcal pneumonia; small Gram-negative coccobacillary forms are typical of H. influenzae, and staphylococcal organisms appear in tetrads and grapelike clusters. In mycoplasma, viral and legionella pneumonia, typical bacterial organisms are not seen. If sputum is not available, a specimen can be obtained by tracheobronchial suction.",

In some areas, particularly Papua New Guinea, South Africa and Spain, resistance of the pneumococcus to penicillin is common. For children with non-severe pneumonia, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or oral amoxicillin for 5 days [9]. In severe pneumonia in hospitalized children, the policy in low-income countries is to first give benzylpenicillin injections, changing the therapy to oral amoxicillin when the child responds. In very severe pneumonia, in children in low-income settings, chloramphenicol may be given first with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin in combination as an alternative 10, 11.Box 1.1Key Facts: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) in Children\n\u202220% of all deaths in children under 5 years are due to ARIs\u202290% of all deaths due to ARIs are due to pneumonia\u2022\nStreptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are two top causes of pneumonia\u2022Low-birthweight, malnourished and non-breastfed children are at high risk of having pneumonia\u2022High fever, rapid breathing, and retraction of the chest are indicators for hospitalization\u2022Children with malnutrition and edema should be admitted to hospital\n",
