For such disasters, a communitarianoriented ethical lens offers useful perspectives into the underlying relational nexus that favors the spread of infection. This chapter compares two traditional bioethical lenses-the communitarian and care ethics framework-vis-\u00e0-vis their capacities to engage the moral quandaries elicited by pandemic influenza. It argues that these quandaries preclude the analytical lens of ethical prisms that are individual-oriented but warrant a people-oriented approach. Adopting this dual approach offers both a contrastive and a complementary way of rethinking the underlying socioethical tensions elicited by pandemic influenza in particular and other public health disasters generally.",

Pandemic influenza is one such incident that afflicts all sectors of the society. 2 It also raises questions and issues related to utility and equity, ensuring the protection of vulnerable individuals and groups in society, the need to exercise public health powers with respect for human rights 3 as well as the just allocation of human and material resources. 4 Attending to these issues, however, juggles many kinds of personal, social, political, and professional interests against one another; thus, reflecting the traditional public health dilemma of fine-tuning individual against collective good. 5 Since the restrictive approach of individualism-driven moral lenses 6 is unsuitable for people-centered quandaries, it seems pertinent to employ a people-centric moral lens to engage them. In this vein, the ethical prism of communitarianism and ethics of care seem apt. By examining and contrasting the core fabric of the communitarian and care ethics frameworks vis-\u00e0-vis the attendant dilemmas of pandemic influenza; this chapter attempts to tease out a broader ethical path towards engaging the challenges of pandemic influenza.",

It has been hypothesized that the virus originated from wild waterfowls and has only slowly evolved through multiple animal species including humans. 8 But what is known about the disease caused by the virus-influenza-is that it is a febrile illness of the upper and lower respiratory tract, characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough, myalgia, and malaise. Pneumonia is a principal serious complication 9 and local symptoms include sniffles, nasal discharge, dry cough, and sore throat. 10 Pandemic influenza outbreaks describe the rapid spread of influenza infection. Whereas there is some conceptual controversy about the description and definition of pandemics, 11 they generally refer to the dissemination of new infective diseases to which immunity has not been developed in a widespread manner across a significant part of the world. 12 They could break out in nations with a large geographical size (such as China, India, and the United States) or when the number of affected nations are many.",

Contemporary society experiences an increased development of new serotypes of several kinds of respiratory viruses because of the evolutionary potential afforded by the human population explosion and the great global increase in human mobility. 16 In a manner of speaking, it seems that PHDs such as pandemic influenza outbreaks have evolved to become recurring features of the human experience. Some insights into the biological features and processes that create pandemic outbreaks support this idea.",

This comprises seven genera including influenza virus A, B, C, and D. 17 Although both the genus influenzavirus A and B affect humans and cause pandemics, 18 influenza A has been the principal culprit in known outbreaks to the extent that four major pandemics have resulted from it (1918-1919, 1957, 1968, and 2009) . 19 However, genetic reassortment and exchange of influenza viruses between humans and animals generate antigenic shift, which periodically introduces new viruses to the human population. This, in addition to mutation and selection, produces antigenic drift that accounts for the year-to-year variations in influenza A subtypes. 20 Wild ducks, for instance, serve as the primary host for various influenza type A viruses that occasionally spread to other host species and cause outbreaks in such animals as fowl, swine, and horses. Such outbreaks often lead to new human pandemics 21 due to novel viruses infecting immunologically na\u00efve people. 22 A critical aspect of the emergence of novel virus strains is genetic variation and combination that occur at the hemagglutinin (HA) antigens (of which there are 16) and neuraminidase (NA) enzymes (of which there are nine) 23 between and amongst human and animal influenza viruses.",

However, it is not known when any will occur or whether it will be caused by the H5N1 avian-derived influenza virus, newer subtypes like H7N9, or completely novel subtypes. Virologists like Webster and Govorkova argue that given the number of cases of H5N1 influenza that have occurred in humans (more than 251) with a mortality or death rate of more than 50%, it would be prudent to develop robust plans for dealing with such pandemic influenza and its (expected) new variations. 30 Such plans, however, necessarily demand attention to the associated ethical dynamics. Regardless of the specific subtype of human or animal-derived influenza outbreaks, the public health challenges and the moral quandaries are essentially the same.",

Specifically, crowds of people facilitate viral transmission by enabling sharp upticks in the rate of transmission. The virus also circulates for longer periods in infected persons. 33 The biological features of influenza and its mode of transmission elicit some observations. One, pandemic influenza is not a single disease for which a single and specific therapeutic intervention that will be effective all the time can be developed. In other words, while there is a general approach to engaging this public health disaster, specific interventions will usually vary by each outbreak. This gives an existential and evolutionary advantage to the influenza virus over human communities. It also engenders a disaster dynamic in the sense that every outbreak becomes \"sudden\" and potentially associated with large human casualties.",

            "text": "An influenza pandemic has the potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than any other public health threat. 34 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were reported. 37 Also, the H5N1 outbreak recorded a death rate of 59%, 38 and the recent H7N9 outbreak caused 251 human infections and 67 deaths. 39 In the United States, the estimated potential threat of pandemic influenza is 1.9 million deaths, 90 million sick people, and nearly 10 million hospitalizations, with almost 1.5 million requiring intensive-care units. 40 Global estimates are higher. For instance, the 1918 \"Spanish flu\" caused an estimated 20-50 million global deaths. 41 It has been projected that a recurrence of the 1918 influenza strain would probably result in the death of 51-81 million individuals. 42 These data show that substantial numbers of deaths are an inevitable consequence and feature of pandemic influenza. However, death itself often brings about certain social consequence including the death of some of the most gifted members of the society. Sir William Osler, one of the pioneers of scientific medicine, died of complications arising from influenza in 1919. Influenza was cited by the German war general, Erich von Ludendorff, as a significant reason for why the initial gains of their last offensive faltered and ultimately failed during World War 1. 43 From a biological perspective, influenza exploits na\u00efve immune systems which tend to over-respond to the influenza virus. As such, young and promising adults constitute a large part of vulnerable victims. In this regard, potential contributions to societies are nipped in the bud, young widows and widowers emerge as well as a lot of orphans. For instance, 21,000 children were orphaned due to the 1918 outbreak in New York City. 44 Influenza also spread within households soon before or after the onset of symptoms in primary infected patients. 45 Another associated social feature of pandemic influenza is the closure of schools with an attendant truncation of learning and educational opportunities, depending on the length of the outbreak. While some of these social features are local and exert localized effects, human beings as social animals with the aid of the increased means of locomotion transmit some of the local features into a global experience. The 1957 pandemic of influenza which occurred during a time of much less globalization spread to the United States within 4-5 months of its detection in China while the 1968 pandemic spread to the U.S. from Hong Kong within 2-3 months. 47 It is estimated that the burden of the next influenza pandemic will be overwhelmingly focused in the developing world. 48 However, the epidemiological notion well-known to public health experts that infectious diseases can predicate outbreaks in neighboring places and nations 49 implies that even so-called developed societies cannot be spared as long as the current interpenetration of people across the globe remains. The 2009 influenza outbreak, for instance, spread to 85 countries and caused a total of 39, 620 cases of infection. 50 In short, in a globalized world, infectious diseases travel in nodes of human, material, and animal networks. 51 Data from sporadic studies suggest that influenza may be fairly prevalent in Africa, albeit sub-clinically. It may, therefore, have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality on the continent 52 should a combination of factors create a virus that is viable enough to cause a pandemic. This will have far-reaching consequences for the continent due to the material and human resource constraints, lack of preparedness plans as well as the very limited bio-therapeutic capacities that are currently available to produce vaccines. It may likewise create the dispersal of a virus novel to other continents that have experienced typical outbreaks.",

First, the nature of the \"disseminating\" nation influences how infection spreads elsewhere. For example, China's slow reaction to the 2003 SARS outbreak as well as its limiting of access to patients and other relevant information 47 HHS, \"Hhs Pandemic Influenza Plan.\" P. B6. 48 86, no. 9 (1996) . P. 1208 54 Eric K Noji, \"Public Health Issues in Disasters,\" Critical Care Medicine 33, no. 1 (2005) . P. S29. seemed to have deepened the global intensity of that crisis. 55 In other words, how a local public health disaster is handled shapes the local severity and how it spreads elsewhere. On the other hand, well-handled local health crises positively influence the possible impacts on contiguous nations. In this vein, Radest notes that Canada's rapid and coordinated response to the SARS outbreak significantly limited its spread and impact in the United States. 56 The above examples echo the interconnectivity of the modern world and show how a course of action in one place, however passive, may significantly influence the course of events in another for good or bad. It supports the idea that contemporary health in the twenty-first century is now inevitably and inherently global with respect to infectious diseases. 57 At the heart of these remarks, however, is the possibility of utilizing different networks of human interconnectivity to actively foster the global good. In other words, learning about how people connect and relate at different levels (individually, communally, institutionally et cetera) and learning about the chief actors and players in such a relationship nexus may provide a powerful tool for driving global public health agenda. Yet, integral to such a process is how responses to pandemic influenza are framed and implemented locally as well as their attendant limitations. This theme is addressed in the next section.",

Black et al. noted that early anti-viral intervention during the 2009 pandemic helped reduce the doubling time in the early stages of the outbreak. 61 The linkage between antiviral use and reduction in clinical severity and influenza infectiousness is generally supported in the extant literature. 62 Hence, treatment of clinical cases with anti-viral agents constitutes the first-line of engagement for pandemic influenza and these drugs are employed to control or contain pandemic outbreaks long enough for vaccines to be made. 63 Yet, drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir, usually neuraminidase inhibitors, can only help reduce transmission if given within a day of the onset of symptoms. 64 On the contrary, delay in symptoms diagnosis, as well as intervention, favors infection dissemination. Nevertheless, antiviral agents for influenza offer some protection to families and households once infection has been detected. In clinical trials, antiviral treatments have been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection, hence, slowing down transmission as well as limiting the severity of the disease. 65 But the effectiveness of neuraminidase such as oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir at reducing mortality is uncertain. 66 In addition, there is some evidence of side-effects. For instance, in adults as in children, oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea and vomiting. Also, treatment trials with oseltamivir or zanamivir do not settle the question of whether the complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) are reduced. 67 Resistance to these anti-viral drugs has also been reported, even in people who have never been previously treated with them. 68 Ultimately, the success of antiviral prophylaxis critically depends on the identification of index cases in households, pre-schools, schools, and other institutional settings. 69 This clearly highlights the importance of personal, social, and institutional cooperation in relation to dealing with the associated challenges.",

They also reported that the national health effects of vaccination were greatly influenced by the timing of vaccine administration and the effectiveness of the vaccine. 72 Similarly, Ferguson et al. estimated that during a global outbreak, vaccination at the rate of 1% of the population per day would need to begin within 2 months of the initial outbreak.

One way of engaging the limits of influenza vaccines involve creating a vaccine type that is capable of eliciting cross-protective peptides/epitopes that would be effective against different variants. But this is very difficult. 86 Besides the scientific technicalities, producing vaccines for pandemic influenza is not a cheap venture. For example, Meltzer, Cox, and Fukuda estimated in 1999 that it would cost the United States about $166.5 billion to contain pandemic influenza. 87 Whereas the economic burden of influenza in lower-and middle-income countries involves direct costs to the health service and households and indirect costs due to a loss in human productivity, 88 these countries also have limited financial capacities to pursue pandemic influenza vaccination as a public health tool.

For instance, school closure is a non-pharmaceutical intervention often suggested for mitigating influenza pandemics. The logic behind this lies in the notion that children are important vectors of transmission, more infectious, and susceptible to most influenza strains than adults. It is also tied to the idea that high a contact rate in schools fosters transmission of infection. This approach, according to Cauchemez and colleagues, may bring about an estimated 40% reduction in peak attack rates. However, this reduction will be hindered if children are not adequately isolated or if the policy is not well implemented. 91 Whereas school closure may only bring about a small reduction in cumulative attack rates, it can foster a substantial reduction in peak attack rates. 92 Closure of schools may, however, increase anxiety and create a crisis, as was observed in France during the 1957 outbreak. 93 Closure of workplaces is another non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic influenza. It may be warranted by the degree of the outbreak in which businesses shut down at their own discretion, and for their own safety, as was seen during the 1918-1919 outbreak. 94 However, it may also be warranted by government policy. Either way, business closure incurs huge economic costs, pecuniary, and other consequences for the different people tied to and/or dependent on the affected businesses or their services and goods.",

These limitations, they note, make it impossible to foresee all the associated future effects and implications of situations and decisions with certitude. 100 In relation to medicine, Jean Daly notes that the art of medicine seeks to abolish uncertainty. 101 Regardless of the good intentions and telos of medicine, the stark reality is that this task has hardly been achieved. contexts. James Marcum contends that uncertainty is largely a part of medicine because of the variability of the underlying biology. 102 Uncertainty is not new in the realm of science. 103 However, in the context of public health disasters uncertainty has a strong pragmatic dimension which can influence courses of actions and decisions in multiple unfavorable ways. For example, it occurs during pandemic influenza outbreaks and generates many concerns. In this vein, Borse et al. note that the public health community cannot accurately predict the arrival of a pandemic. 104 Indeed, a great deal of uncertainty occurs in relation to estimating the potential impact of a pandemic such as influenza. 105 This scenario stifles preparedness efforts, especially in resource-constrained countries where there are often competing social needs to be met with limited budgets.

Assuming the level of risks remains constant, over-preparing for a pandemic will undoubtedly involve the committing and expenditure of more human and material resources to an outbreak. This will create a sense of waste (to decision and policy makers) after the incident and may affect the resources that will be committed to future outbreaks. The right amount of preparation will help curtail an outbreak while under-preparedness will barely help curtail an outbreak. However, if the level of risk increases, over-preparing may help curtail a pandemic whereas what was hitherto ample preparedness as well as what was hitherto not enough will enable the full range of the effects of a pandemic outbreak to be felt. \" ibid.5, no. 5 (1999) .

Not surprisingly, scholars like Peter Doshi argue that there is a need for evidence-based ways to address hypothetical scenarios of non-zero probability such as the notion that novel influenza pathogens acquire increased virulence during successive \"waves\" of infection. 108 The scientific uncertainty associated with health disasters such as pandemic influenza may, however, tempt government officials to attempt some form of a cover-up, hence, raising trust issues. For instance, during the 1911 cholera outbreak in Naples, Italian officials paid newspapers and reporters not to report the outbreak. Chinese officials tried to keep the 2003 SARS outbreak a secret. Saudi officials, likewise, tried to silence the virologist who discovered the coronavirus in 2012 and ultimately forced him to resign from his position. 109 Incidents like these have the tendency to dissuade social cooperation during public health emergencies like influenza and have the potential to weaken the overall success of public health interventions.",

For instance, only a small amount of any vaccine can be stockpiled 111 because the scientific and public health community can hardly be sure of the efficacy of any given vaccine prior to an outbreak. This is due to possible vaccine failure which will make a new outbreak not amenable to the biological effects of hitherto effective vaccines. Hence, vaccines are generally not produced until the new virus strain causing a pandemic is isolated. 112 Also, there is uncertainty over who will be at highest risk of infection and complications. 113 This creates a dilemma of some sorts with the potential that a class of the people who need vaccines may not get enough, while another class of people who will benefit less from vaccination gets too much. Another kind of uncertainty is linked with possible side-effects of vaccines.

Responding to influenza vaccine safety signals during a pandemic constitutes a scientific and public health policy issue since decision-makers must balance the immediate consequences of disease against uncertain risks. 116 One of the consequences of the therapeutic uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza is the validity of administering potentially ineffective antiviral drugs with side-effects or vaccines that may cause harm to people. Another is the validity of withholding such drugs and vaccines because it may not be useful for some class of people, or because some people may experience certain degrees of side-effects. These issues raise concerns about human rights and whether or not they may be violated through these courses of actions, or by any other course of action associated with handling a pandemic influenza outbreak.",

On the other hand, administering antiviral drugs to non-vaccinated at-risk people helps reduce the severity of illness. 122 During disaster scenarios, the goal remains saving lives but a pandemic scenario in which 25-50% of the population can fall sick within a very short time 123 often demands some type of prioritization of resources. This is partly because keeping some sets of people alive, especially health workers will ultimately help society keep more people alive during a public health disaster. For instance, the traditional view is that prioritizing the vaccination of front-line healthcare workers can help reduce staff absenteeism as well as help prevent them from becoming vectors of viral infection. This is often justified by the logic that a PHD situation such as pandemic influenza often makes health professionals work outside their normal scope of practice, put in extra hours, cover for ill workers, accept great risks 124 as well as incur other situational unexpected responsibilities and supererogatory duties.",

In this vein, isolation and quarantine raise concerns about the acceptability of confining people and preventing them from engaging in some of the social activities they otherwise would have loved.

In relation to this strand of thought, Shah notes that during epidemics, the traditional attitude of the Acholi people of Uganda involves working together to isolate the sick, mark homes of the sick with long elephant grass, warn outsiders not to visit affected villages, and refraining from potentially infection-transmitting practices including sexual intercourse. 131 This suggests at least two things.",

Traditionally, belonging to the human community or occupying specific facets of life constitutes sources of vulnerability. But the state of being susceptible to harm by the actions and activities of other people or by parts of nature such as viral organisms is also a potential source. In addition, the state of vulnerability may ensue from a range of social, economic, and political conditions. 135 In the context of pandemic influenza, the naturalistic, socioeconomic, epistemic, political, and biological dimensions of vulnerability arise. On the one hand, humans located in pandemic-prone cities or countries and other human beings linked to the global community by technological means of transportation (such as air travel) or non-technological ones (such as migrating birds) are generally vulnerable to influenza outbreaks. The likelihood of a novel strain of influenza outbreak occurring in a country such as China (for instance, Jiangcun in Guangzhou) where large numbers of people, birds, and swine mingle freely in certain markets is very high 136 ; hence, making the local population and consequently the people of such a nation more vulnerable. 132 MacPhail, The Viral Network: A Pathography of the H1n1 Influenza Pandemic.

Yet, the combination of these factors facilitates the ready transfer and exchange of the influenza viruses amongst people, especially when they are in close proximity. 142 The foregoing shows how susceptibility and vulnerability to infection during pandemic influenza reflect a combination of factors. 143 How these combine in specific localities and regions will, therefore, determine the extent of an outbreak. It is also clear that some amount of control can be exerted on minimizing some of these factors. For instance, the use of face mask (to limit infection acquisition and spread), transparency (to combat political bottlenecks), and monetary aid (to help poor nations) will exert some preventive effects on infection transmission, hence, limiting the overall burdens and severity of an outbreak.

Bioethicists like Stephen Holland regard the communitarian lens as useful since it aims at realizing collective interests. This same idea offers a strong justificatory argument for adopting it in relation to public health interventions. 148 Communitarianism pays attention to the social sphere, institutions, and interrelationships in relation to moral judgments that will inform public health policy and practice. Its ethos provides an alternative to the dominant atomistic lens of individualism which operates via the logic of self-protection 149 and the unbridled 147 MacPhail, The Viral Network: A Pathography of the H1n1 Influenza Pandemic.

For people raised within the traditional family structure-father, mother, children, and relatives-the family unit constitutes a micro-community which generally socializes the child into a community-oriented way of reasoning. While the strength of such an orientation is expressed in different measures by different individuals, it also provides the cognitive platform for balancing and pursuing personal interests in a feedback loop with the collective interests of other family members. Yet, the ultimate measure of what level of community-oriented reasoning an individual retains in adult life will depend on their education, social experiences, whatever meanings they draw from these, and how these parameters are brought to bear in the context of specific decisions and choices. This reality partly explains the multiple versions and interpretations of communitarianism, which tends to mar its conceptual and theoretical coherence. 152 It also partly explains why community values are not generally shared by all. 153 Communitarians advance three different types of claims: descriptive claims which stress the social nature of people; normative claims which celebrate the value of community and solidarity, and a meta-ethical claim which emphasizes the idea that political principles should mirror \"shared understandings'. 154 Two of these dynamics-the normative as well as the metaethical-are important in relation to engaging the ethical issues elicited by pandemic influenza. The significance of the meta-ethical dimension of communitarianism is its capacity to help drive and ground public health policies. This is especially so considering the reality that community and living together in today's fragmented and individualistic world is generally seen ever less as a necessity and assumes the dimensions of a choice as the default state. 155 Hence, these two facets will be examined in relation to their possible 150 insights and pragmatic importance vis-\u00e0-vis engaging the quandaries associated with influenza outbreaks.",

This can come through appropriate educational policies and approaches carried out prior to and during influenza outbreaks. It is not known when and in whom influenza therapeutic interventions such as antiviral drugs and vaccines may cause side-effects. It is also not known when an outbreak will occur or the attendant magnitude. Since public health disasters are classless in terms of who will and who may not be affected, the scenario of uncertainty affects every segment of people in the local communities and nation. Hence, health workers, government officials, the rich, the poor, the educated and illiterates and other possible stratification of society are potential victims. A communitarian ethos is useful in at least two ways in relation to dealing with the uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza. Generally, it can-with the right pre-disaster public education-help ensure that people understand the unavoidable scientific and knowledge-related gaps in preparedness policies and specific plans put together to engage a specific outbreak. This will help avoid or minimize blame, since scapegoating during disease outbreaks causes different shades of disruption and target important actors including health workers. 157 In fact, the better educated the public is about the challenges of stockpiling vaccines, the more cooperative they will likely be to the vaccine-supply challenges that arise during an outbreak.",

This is especially so if the people whose rights may be inhibited or violated do not consent to the process. To avert this, a discursive approach involving inclusive deliberations is essential. In this vein, the communitarian lens can help foster dialogue as well as call for the need to reward people for the sacrifices they may or will bear on behalf of the community and the society. For instance, guaranteeing that some compensation will be paid for financial losses incurred through workplace closure as well as apt public education about the nature, purposes, and conditions of quarantine facilities will help convince people that such temporary rights-related inconveniences are for the benefits of the overall society.",

For example, it can offer a way of making the important distinction between general vulnerability that people will experience as human beings, vulnerability based on age, and occupational vulnerability seen in health professionals. Based on these distinctions, it can help underscore how context-specific cooperation will help ensure the overall success of the countermeasures adopted to engage a given pandemic. Critical to this, however, is the moral currency of trust. Trust shapes how the public evaluates risks and benefits. It also influences the acceptance of prescribed public measures to mitigate present or perceived risks. 159 Effective risk and crisis communication depend on public trust in the government during a pandemic. As such, a higher level of trust will influence a more positive level of social compliance. van der Weerd and colleagues corroborated this in their empirical study of the 2009 pandemic in the Netherlands. 160 In addition to trust, transparency in terms of how priorities will be made in terms of the allocation of vaccines as well as antiviral agents, and decisions pertaining to school and/or workplace closures is important. Even in western climes, public health experts have sometimes pointed out the paucity of transparency in ethical reasoning and the scanty explicit ethical justification for pandemic-related policies. 161 Obviously, an atmosphere of trust and transparency will be conducive to 158 discussing and addressing issues related to local justice. This is especially relevant in relation to less wealthy nations or countries with weak institutions. For instance, it will be hard to garner cooperation in hitherto abandoned communities by appealing to communitarian ethos without addressing extant disparities in the social fabric as well as the healthcare system.",

Since every nation lacks an equal capacity to deal with the local burdens of pandemic influenza, it is necessary for wealthier nations to rally around poorer ones. Indeed, the transcontinental nature of health disasters including pandemic influenza and SARS underscores the urgent need to strengthen how the global community deals with emerging infectious diseases, and how novel visions of global solidarity and cooperation will be key in such an endeavor. 163 This constitutes a preventive stance and falls well within the traditional agenda of public health.

            "text": "In addition to the communitarian lens, the ethics of care perspective (EOC) constitutes a people-centric method of attempting to resolve ethical issues. Whereas it sometimes arrives at the same conclusions reached by traditional bioethical approaches, 164 employing it as a complimentary approach to the moral quandaries generated by pandemic influenza should yield additional nuances and insights vis\u00e0-vis resolving the associated moral concerns. Care ethics emphasizes varying degrees of care within relational contexts ranging from the personal sphere to the realm of moral strangers. Hence, it is an other and people-centric moral lens. It has 162 Henk ten Have, Global Bioethics: An Introduction (Routledge, 2016). P. 113. 163 Peter A Singer et al., \"Ethics and Sars: Lessons from Toronto,\" British Medical Journal 327, no. 7427 (2003) . Pp. 1342-1343. 164 Edwards, \"Is there a Distinctive Care Ethics?\" P. 185. been applied to diverse relational contexts including everyday lives, professional practices, social and public policies, as well as international relations. 165 For scholars like Steven Edwards, ethics of care uses a distinct ontological commitment to realize its outcomes as well as justify its stance. 166 It is an attempt to re-conceptualize and renegotiate the moral landscape in order to give room for a plurality of values. 167 Some have argued that the removal of friendship with its altruistic emotional sequelae and the subversion of virtue ethics from the sphere of morality were some key factors that warranted the moral change which birthed the ethics of care framework. 168 While EOC is also linked with gender-based morality which undergirded campaigns for equal employment opportunities between the sexes, legal rights, reforms of family life and sexual standards, and better education 169 ; scholars like Noddings have pointed out that it is broader and deeper than feminist ethics. 170 To be sure, one of its major impetus is the call for the expression of higher capabilities. 171 Care ethics also encapsulates a spectrum of ideas. For Kittay, care constitutes an \"achievement term\" such that caring occurs only when specific acts of care have been carried out. 172 In this vein, intentionality would not qualify as part of the baggage of care rhetoric. This obviously has some pragmatic appeal. Most people, for instance, would only appreciate care if it helps contribute towards relieving their current distress. Yet, caring may also constitute a general attitude and an orientation which may provide appropriate background conditions for shaping responses to others' needs and states of distresses. Also, one may care but situational constraints may limit how a caring impulse may translate into pragmatic ends. Therefore, that someone simply \"lacked opportunity\" to show care as Apostle Paul writes in his epistle to the Philippians does not necessarily indicate the absence of care. 173 Hence, caring cannot be reduced only to materialistic terms. One way to distinguish the general caring orientation from specific acts of care is to refer to each as \"caring about\" and \"caring for\" respectively. 174 Care ethics locates morality within the ambiance of family, friends, and colleagues, and ultimately towards the public sphere. 175 It rejects the independent and atomistic notion of the self and champions an inter-dependent and inter-related view. 176 This approach grants EOC a psychological gestalt to which people brought up in caring relationships, at least in the early phases of their lives, can readily identify with. It thus partly appeals to Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Here, the emphasis is put on the foundational roles of trust and its place in fostering a deepened sense of reciprocity within a social context of inequality. 177 Not surprisingly, some ethicists describe caring as the primary virtue which offers a general account of right versus wrong actions as well as political justice. 178 Whereas the informal social contract idea underlies inter-personal and stateindividual relationships, 179 the care ethical lens may be applied to the personal sphere as well as social institutions 180 due to its multiple ways of situating relationality. 181 Indeed, EOC focuses on attentiveness and sensitivity to the needs of others 182 and offers a moral compass for teasing out delicate boundaries between obligation-based ethics and responsibility-based ethics. As such, it seeks to transcend the depersonalized realm of asking \"what obligations do I have to Mr. X\" to the humane realm of asking \"how can I help Mr. X\" in scenarios of moral crises. 183 Since caring embodies an activity, a set of activities or a labor of care from one person to the other, it presupposes that the capacity for receiving care 184 will be present in the recipient(s) of care.",

Firstly, care ethics can, through relevant public policy, 186 positively influence how victims of disasters are cared for. Secondly, contexts of duty exist between some of the players and victims of disasters which form the basis of a relationship of caring. For instance, healthcare professionals incur fiduciary duties to at-risk people, victims of a public health disaster as well as the general populace that may potentially be infected and infect others. Thirdly, if the care ethical prism emphasizes how individuals may offer help \"in scenarios of moral crises, 187 then it should be relevant in health scenarios where different kinds of conflicting moral emergencies occur. The application of care ethics to specific disaster contexts such as influenza outbreaks, however, requires elaboration. Specifically, this needs some explication with reference to issues of uncertainty, vulnerability, human rights and justice. Whereas the dilemma of uncertainty that arises during pandemic influenza affects everyone, it will affect different sets of people differently. For instance, the biological uncertainties associated with an influenza outbreak are not known to the same extent by public health experts, health workers, the literate, and illiterate members of the society.",

The relational context, in this regard, may be situated and realized through professional associations, institutional contexts, public announcements through media outlets and patienthealth professional interactions. Kunin et al. recently reported on how primary care physicians helped pass on important pandemic-related information to out-patients during the 2009 pandemic in Israel. This, they concluded, helped enhance the success of the national pre-pandemic preparedness plans. 188 Indeed, during public health disasters, the speed at which information is needed by policymakers may be faster than is usually possible through traditional mechanisms of research dissemination. This scenario makes information sharing a norm; even possibly those provided by preliminary research findings. 189 Humans instinctively show care to other humans in need. While this caring instinct has been socially modified and conditioned in some parts of the world where individualistic tendencies run rife, some communal-oriented cultures give room for a freer expression of the instinct of care. The instinct of care may, however, be counterproductive in the context of PHDs. For instance, during pandemic influenza, sick and dying patients remain active carriers of infection, 190 as such, will infect susceptible friends and relations who feel obligated to show care in relation to helping them. In other words, \"unbridled\" caring may increase the vulnerabilities elicited during pandemic influenza. Yet, the care ethics moral lens may help modify and re-direct the caring impulse in a more socially useful way during a pandemic.",

In other words, how a healthcare worker will care professionally in the hospital context and supererogatorily in the non-hospital context will differ from how a lay member of the society can show care in a pandemic situation. However, appealing to the EOC may help facilitate the selflessness needed. If someone cares that their society survives an influenza outbreak, then they should be willing to play roles that will help bring about that goal. This will facilitate compliance with therapeutic measures such as vaccines and antiviral drugs as well as non-pharmaceutical measures such as contact tracing, quarantine, and workplace closure.

P. 72. tion that it is not possible to integrate and apply justice to care, 192 such a limitation hardly applies to the context of a public health disaster such as pandemic influenza. For instance, the different conflicting priorities that arise during influenza outbreaks such as rationing of limited resources will be easier if some people are at least willing to forgo their interests for others. In non-familial carer and cared-for relationships involving at-risk government representatives and at-risk members of the society and familial relationships involving parents and children living in the same house, an appeal to a care ethical lens may help drive the moral sensitivity to the needs of others, enabling some vaccine-eligible persons (under the standard rationing criteria) to forgo their ration, preferring rather that other at-risk people (for example, ordinary people and younger family members) have them. This kind of selflessness approximates some form of humanitarian act in that person A decides to overlook their interests for others \"without expecting rewards\". 193 However, because human beings naturally seek their own personal interests, there may be some difficulty in achieving this other-centric goal in as many people as possible in a public health disaster situation. This implies that the care ethical lens may have some limitations in relation to sufficiently engaging the ethical dilemmas raised by pandemic influenza in particular and other types of public health disasters, in general.
