Although most HRSV infections remain restricted to the upper respiratory tract (URT) and are associated with relatively mild clinical signs, approximately 0.5%\u20132% of primary infections in infants below six months of age result in severe bronchiolitis or pneumonia requiring hospitalization [1]. Young infants with a history of premature birth and those with congenital heart or lung disease have an increased risk of developing severe disease upon primary HRSV infection [2]. Another high-risk group of severe HRSV disease is found at the other extreme of age\u2014the frail elderly\u2014with progressively waning immunity, in which HRSV is recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality [3]. A third high-risk group of severe HRSV disease is formed of individuals who are immunocompromised, either iatrogenically upon e.g., cell or organ transplantation or cancer treatment, or through inherited or acquired immunodeficiency [4,5,6].",

Immunosuppressive medication given to prevent transplant rejection or graft-versus-host disease causes increased susceptibility to infection, and may lead to prolonged virus shedding [8,9,10]. Severity of disease and mortality risk are directly associated with the level and duration of immunodeficiency [11,12]. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections with HRSV have especially been associated with high morbidity and mortality in allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [5,13]. In lung transplant recipients, HRSV infections have been associated with induction of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [14]. Therapeutic options are currently restricted to administration of ribavirin and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [15,16], although several antiviral compounds are currently in clinical development [2,17].",

Preclinical studies in animal models could be instrumental, but all animal models of HRSV infection have limitations [18]. Several animal models have been developed with specific benefits such as high susceptibility (cotton rats, calves, lambs), availability of immunological reagents and knockout strains (mice), and close relationship to humans (non-human primates). However, none of these models fully captures all of these advantages. The human challenge model offers an alternative approach [19,20,21], but for obvious reasons these studies do not allow investigation of severe LRT disease and cannot be performed in individuals belonging to risk groups. Therefore, evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy of antiviral compounds in immunocompromised patients largely depends on phase III clinical studies, which are expensive and hard to conduct in this heterogeneous patient group.",

Indeed, observations in the immunocompromised ferrets were comparable to those in humans with prolonged influenza virus shedding and emergence of antiviral resistance. The ease of handling the animals allowed for daily collection or respiratory tract swabs, which enabled detailed studies of the kinetics of virus replication. However, whereas ferrets are among the best animal species for modeling human influenza, previous reports of HRSV infections in ferrets have yielded disappointing results. In particular, Prince and Porter infected ferrets of different ages with the Long strain of HRSV, and showed that the virus replicated well in the URT, but poorly in the LRT [22]. Moreover, replication in the LRT proved to be age-dependent and restricted to infant ferrets.",

They observed replication in respiratory epithelial cells in the URT of ferrets of all ages, but exclusively detected replication in the LRT in infant ferrets. Interestingly, in these animals HRSV replicated in the alveolar epithelial cells. In IT inoculated ferrets we clearly detected HRSV replication in bronchial epithelial cells, which are also predominant target cells for HRSV in humans [28]. The major differences between the two studies are the route of inoculation and the passage history of the virus. In our study, we have no evidence to show whether IN inoculation of ferrets using an inoculum size of 0.3 mL (150 \u03bcL per nostrum) resulted in efficient LRT infection. This will need to be addressed in future experiments in which IN-inoculated animals will be euthanized at early time points. Although HRSV loads were detected in throat swabs of both immunocompetent (Figure 1E) and immunocompromised (Figure 2E) animals, this virus could have derived from either the URT or the LRT. Nevertheless, we expect that the different outcomes of the two studies mainly result from the use of a laboratory-adapted versus a wild-type HRSV strain. In other studies, the use of clinical isolates has also been associated with different outcomes of infection both in vitro and in vivo [29,30,31].",

            "text": "Several animal models have been developed for HRSV, but none of these fully reproduce the pathogenesis of severe HRSV disease observed in humans [32]. This is partly due to the complex pathogenesis in humans, where primary infection can either result in subclinical virus replication, mild disease, or severe disease requiring hospitalization. As we do not fully understand what drives severe disease in humans, it is almost impossible to reproduce this disease in animals. One of the major disadvantages of the ferret model as it is presented here is the apparent lack of clinical signs. It may be possible to induce clinical signs by using a higher virus dose for primary infection, but it is questionable whether that would really mimic human disease. Studies in which clinical signs are of importance can probably better be performed using a natural host model such as the bovine RSV model in calves or lambs [33,34]. A second drawback of the ferret model is the limited availability of immunological reagents, which largely precludes in-depth immunological studies. This is a major restriction, as HRSV bronchiolitis is associated with inflammation and is sometimes considered an immune-mediated disease [35]. Therefore, murine models of HRSV will remain indispensable to support our understanding of the mammalian immune response to HRSV. Finally, our experiments with PZ show that these human immunoglobulins exhibit a short half-life in ferrets, requiring an adjusted dosing schedule to address the efficacy in this animal model. These observations are in accordance with previous studies that found limited effectiveness of human antibodies in the infant ferret model, whereas maternal infection did provide protection against HRSV [36]. Still, the ferret model of HRSV also has a number of strong advantages. First of all, ferrets appear to be highly susceptible to infection with wild-type HRSV. In combination with the ease of handling the animals, which allows for daily collection of throat and nose swabs, this allows sensitive detection of viral loads at high resolution. Importantly, the viral load curves start at undetectable virus levels one or two days after inoculation, demonstrating that the virus detected at later time points is not residual input virus, but truly derives from de novo produced HRSV particles. In fact, the ferret studies resemble individual case studies in humans. The fact that the ferrets are outbred non-SPF animals results in a significant level of biological variation, but also brings the model closer to the real situation in humans, in which similar variation is observed. Experiments in ferrets will often include fewer animals than those in rodents, but this is compensated for by the fact that day-to-day collection of clinical specimens is much easier. Finally, when compared to the prototypic highly susceptible animal model for HRSV, the cotton rat, an important difference is the high level of HRSV replication in tracheal epithelial cells, which appears to be absent in cotton rats [23]. Despite their high susceptibility, HRSV-infected cotton rats do not transmit the virus to naive cage mates by direct transmission [37]. We will investigate whether ferrets can be used for transmission studies, which would further strengthen their potential use in preclinical testing of antiviral compounds.",

            "text": "A major strength of the ferret model is the potential to model infection of immunocompromised animals using immunosuppressive medication regularly used in human transplant patients [8]. Respiratory virus infections are described as an important cause of severe respiratory tract disease in immunocompromised patients [5,6,13,38]. The most prevalent respiratory viruses in this population are rhinoviruses and coronaviruses [38], but severe respiratory tract infections are in most cases caused by influenza viruses or paramyxoviruses, including HRSV [39]. With ongoing specialization, academic hospitals have seen a shift in the profile of patients, resulting in an increased number of immunocompromised patients with severe comorbidities. The majority of severe influenza and paramyxovirus infections in adults involves patients with some form of immune dysfunction related to preceding hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation, or to oncology treatment. The immune suppression results in delayed viral clearance [8,9,40], leading to increased risk of lower respiratory tract infection, potential for development of antiviral resistance, escape from neutralizing antibodies, and risk of nosocomial spread [41,42]. Our findings obtained using the immunocompromised ferrets resemble the increased viral loads and delayed viral clearance in humans, as demonstrated by the day-to-day sampling of the immunocompromised ferrets. Animal models for HRSV infection of the immunocompromised host have also been developed in mice and cotton rats, resulting in more severe lung lesions or prolonged RSV replication, respectively [43,44]. However, these models were based on the use of cyclophosphamide monotherapy, which is less commonly used in humans than combination immune suppressive therapies. As ferrets provide an important animal model for human influenza, we previously developed a protocol to induce immune suppression in ferrets using medication routinely used in human transplant patients, and demonstrated prolonged influenza virus replication [8]. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the use of antiviral compounds could result in development of drug resistance. Based on the HRSV data presented in the current manuscript, we believe that the HRSV model in ferrets can be used in parallel with the influenza model for preclinical studies of antiviral efficacy and development of drug resistance.",
