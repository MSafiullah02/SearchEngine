In eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, the acquisition of cellular\ncopper requires a conserved plasma membrane-localized Cu(I) importer,\nCtr1 (Figure 2, left).11 The copper trafficking hypothesis12 posits\nthat free copper present in the cytosol is vanishingly low and that\nCu(I) must be shuttled to distinct cellular targets by dedicated Cu(I)\nchaperones. The human Cu(I) chaperone Atox1 (Figure 2) is conserved from bacteria (denoted CopZ; vide infra) to man and is a small cytosolic protein with the ferredoxin-like\nfold harboring a solvent-exposed CXXC motif that forms a bisthiolate\nCu(I) complex.13 Atox1 is proposed to acquire\nCu(I) from the C-terminal domain of hCtr1 directly via a specific\nprotein\u2013protein interaction14 or\nvia a glutathione\u2013Cu(I) complex intermediate.15 It is unclear how cells ensure that Atox1 is capable of\nsequestering all Cu(I) imported through hCtr1. A recent study reveals\nthat Atox1 is capable of binding to liposomes, a mimic of the plasma\nmembrane, via weak electrostatic interactions in vitro thereby reducing the dimensionality of the search along the inner\nleaflet of the plasma membrane and facilitating Cu(I) loading.16 Likewise a recently characterized bacterial\nCu(I) chaperone, CupA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, localizes to the plasma membrane via a single membrane-spanning\nhelix (Figure 2, top).17",
