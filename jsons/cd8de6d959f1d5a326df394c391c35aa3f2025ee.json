However, simple combinations of multiple query keywords may not generate satisfactory search results. We therefore propose a search method which automatically combines query keywords to generate queries by extracting the relations among query keywords. This method consists of two Web search processes: one to determine the temporal relations between query keywords, and one to generate queries based on the obtained temporal relations. We discuss these two processes along with experimental results and implementation issues regarding a prototype system.",
