Recent research has analyzed, inter alia: the determinants of persistent differences in regional rates of entrepreneurship (Andersson and Koster 2010; Bishop and Shilcof 2017; Fotopoulos and Storey 2017; Koster and Hans 2017; Modrego et al. 2017); regional firm entry and exit rates (Bishop and Shilcof 2017; Li 2017); the location and mobility of entrepreneurs (Di Addario and Vuri 2010; Kulchina 2016); regional knowledge spillovers as an entrepreneurship attractor (Audretsch et al. 2006; Bonaccorsi et al. 2014); and the concentration of entrepreneurship in neighborhoods, cities and clusters (Di Addario and Vuri 2010; Pe\u2019er and Keil 2013). This valuable background has greatly enhanced our understanding of regional aspects of entrepreneurship.",

            "text": "What is much less well-known is why many entrepreneurs locate their ventures at their place of residence. It turns out that entrepreneurial homeworkers are surprisingly prevalent. For example, according to the present study, which utilizes data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS)\u2014a representative longitudinal dataset of individuals and households residing in the UK\u2014nearly 40% of the self-employed in the UK are homeworkers. This fact appears to be little known, in part because apart from a handful of prior studies (Mason et al. 2011; Reuschke 2016), entrepreneurial homeworking has been largely neglected as a research topic. This neglect is surprising for several reasons. First, homeworking influences entrepreneurs\u2019 ability to serve lucrative markets and scale their businesses by hiring workers. Hence, it bears on entrepreneurial performance. Second, homeworking carries implications for understanding who participates in entrepreneurship. This is of interest to researchers concerned with the drivers of entrepreneurial selection. Third, the joint emergence of high-tech occupations and the decline of \u201ctraditional\u201d employment provided by large employers make homeworking a topical alternative mode of employment. There is considerable policy interest in discovering more about the prevalence of homeworking in the new digital economy (Blount 2015; Huws et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Moreover, uncovering the determinants of entrepreneurial homeworking can inform several prominent areas of entrepreneurship research. These include how entrepreneurs manage work-life balance, where they locate their ventures, and how public policy influences entry into entrepreneurship. First, emerging research demonstrates that many people value the flexibility of being self-employed, and often \u201cblur\u201d home and work commitments to enhance their well-being and satisfaction (Boden 1999; Hurst and Pugsley 2011; Sev\u00e4 et al. 2016). While much research has emphasized the importance of variations in work hours for achieving flexibility, the potential role of homeworking in this regard (whereby entrepreneurs can quickly switch between performing home and work duties) has been rather neglected. Second, entrepreneurship scholars are increasingly investigating entrepreneurs\u2019 venture location choices (Dahl and Sorenson 2010; Koster and Venhorst 2014; Kulchina 2016; Stam 2007), and how these choices affect the performance of their ventures (Di Addario and Vuri 2010; Frederiksen et al. 2016). Yet this body of research is largely silent about homeworking, even though it may allow entrepreneurs to economize on commuting costs and rents, while facilitating flexible working. Third, public policy is known to favor entrepreneurship through, for example, various programs that promote self-employment as a career choice (Caliendo and Kritikos 2010; Michaelides and Benus 2012; Parker 2018, Chaps. 18\u201321). Policymakers also design policies to encourage entrepreneurs to create jobs for others (Henrekson and Johansson 2010; Mathur 2010). To date, however, few policy prescriptions have connected these hitherto disparate threads, even though (as we will argue) entrepreneurial homeworking may provide a basis for doing so.",

The purpose of the present article is to investigate this possibility, and in the process to analyze the determinants of homeworking, including business structure and caregiving responsibilities. Using BHPS data, this paper uncovers salient determinants of selection into homeworking and provides evidence about whether homeworking is or is not a transitional phase for entrepreneurial ventures. As a byproduct, our findings also shed light on two outstanding puzzles in entrepreneurship scholarship, showing how homeworking can partly explain why so few of the self-employed create jobs for others, and why on average the self-employed suffer an earnings penalty compared with employees.",

Evidence shows that non-financial factors influence entrepreneurs\u2019 choices (Burke et al. 2000; Hurst and Pugsley 2011; Taylor 1996). These factors include a desire for creativity and autonomy (Block and Koellinger 2009; Hytti et al. 2013; Schneck 2014), and intrinsic satisfaction from work (Guerra and Patuelli 2016; Lange 2012). Another relevant factor is the flexibility afforded by self-employment. Entrepreneurs work longer hours on average than employees but often enjoy greater latitude over when they work and what tasks they perform there (Hyytinen and Ruuskanen 2007). Flexibility can be especially beneficial for entrepreneurs having household and caregiving responsibilities, who need to juggle their time between work and home (Boden 1999; Hurst and Pugsley 2011; Sev\u00e4 et al. 2016). Overall, the evidence suggests that entrepreneurs care about both financial payoffs and non-financial factors when deciding whether to run a business (Block and Koellinger 2009). This insight informs our theorizing below, which incorporates both financial and non-financial components of utility into entrepreneurs\u2019 decision-making calculus.",

The local nature of social networks and the need to reduce commuting costs given long work hours also explain why many entrepreneurs live close to where they work.

We commence by noting that many residences are spatially constrained and lack the facilities to accommodate employees on-site (Reuschke 2016). This may prevent entrepreneurs from being able to offer a comfortable working environment to employees, inducing entrepreneurs to eschew homeworking in favor of using a dedicated office or factory location outside the home. In addition, many employees expect standard working conditions and hours, and access to standard office resources which may be lacking in somebody else\u2019s home. For instance, unless a home is exceptionally commodious, and can be renovated to house regular office facilities and equipment, it may be difficult to offer employees the kinds of working conditions they are used to in larger firms.",

One solution to this problem is for the entrepreneur to rent a central, dedicated office location, which is the logical alternative to homeworking. In such a location, the entrepreneur can work alongside their employees, making monitoring simpler and more effective. For all these reasons, one would therefore expect that, in the context of maximizing expected financial returns, employer entrepreneurs are less likely to be homeworkers:Hypothesis 1The propensities of entrepreneurs to choose homeworking and hire employees are negatively related.",

Home location is likely to impose monitoring costs on the business partner whose residence is not being used as the business location, as discussed above in the context of employees. While this is not necessarily an insuperable complication, it can entail time-consuming and ongoing negotiations between business partners, reducing the attractiveness of home-based venturing for one or more of the business partners.

Real options logic (Dixit et al. 1994) suggests that entrants seek to avoid heavy early-stage investments until they are sure that the payoff in entrepreneurship is high enough to merit them. One such costly investment is in arranging to secure and equip an office location for a new venture, since if the venture fails to thrive, the associated costs are largely sunk and unrecoverable.

Summarizing these predictions, we have:Hypothesis 4aHomeworking status in entrepreneurship is positively associated with transitions into non-homeworking employer status in entrepreneurship the following year.Hypothesis 4bHomeworking status in entrepreneurship is positively associated with transitions into non-homeworking business partnership status in entrepreneurship the following year.",

On the other hand, almost all self-employment involves the entrepreneurial functions of risk-bearing and business ownership and control. Self-employment is a prominent and important segment of the labor market, accounting for over 10% of the workforce in the UK, the USA, and many other countries (Parker 2018, Chap. 1). Many self-employed are business owners whose activities have been linked to aggregate productivity, wealth creation, job generation, innovation, and growth (Guiso and Schivardi 2011; Koellinger and Thurik 2012). Since all entrepreneurs own their own business and do not have an employer, the self-employment measure possesses the merit of inclusiveness.

We coded a variable High-tech occupation as a binary variable using the BHPS SOC 2000 classification. Science, technology, research, design, legal, and financial professions are coded as high-tech occupations. Table 7 in the Appendix provides a detailed list.",

For example, married entrepreneurs may be more financially secure and so better able to support flexible homeworking that can accommodate other household responsibilities such as caregiving (Werbel and Danes 2010). We accordingly coded a dummy variable called Married. In addition, abundant research has linked human capital with self-employment, which may affect various types of self-employment differently (Parker 2018, Sec. 5.2). We therefore included two human capital controls: a dummy for whether the respondent is a graduate, Graduate; and age as a broad measure of experience, Age.

To start with, regions with high average house prices tend also to have higher business office rents (Dobson and Goddard 1992) and so are more likely to induce entrepreneurs to work from home if they can. In addition, higher regional average earnings tend to be concentrated in urban centers where there is a higher density of consumers (Dumais et al. 2002).

LAD-level average house price data from 2004 to 2008 were obtained from the UK House Price Index (UK HPI) dataset. The UK HPI uses house sales data from HM Land Registry, and Registers of Scotland. House sales data are compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). We used average house price data of each LAD as of December of each calendar year and log-transformed the numbers to generate the control variable House price. Average earnings for each LAD were taken from ONS, Earnings and hours worked, place of residence by local authority: ASHE Table 8. We used Table 8.7a (annual pay) of each year during 2004\u20132008. We had to map each ASHE unit code to corresponding LAD codes to transform the data to LAD level. These data were used to compute a log-transformed Local earnings variable. Note that for all cases, House price and Local earnings exhibit variation from year to year. Additionally, we collected data on the local unemployment rate, Unemployment rate, at the LAD level from UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As noted in the \u201cIs homeworking a transitional state?\u201d section, if that is the case, one might expect numerous hybrid entrepreneurs to transition into homeworking from year to year. To check whether this notion gains empirical support, Table 4 presents the year-to-year transition matrix for hybrid and non-hybrid entrepreneurs, calculated by pooling every wave of the sample. The table shows that, among non-hybrid entrepreneurs, there are relatively high annual transition rates (11\u201317%) between homeworking and non-homeworking. In contrast, virtually no hybrid entrepreneurs make transitions into homeworking\u2014or even out of hybrid status. Hence, homeworking does not seem to be a risk-minimization strategy for hybrid entrepreneurs, casting doubt on the notion that homeworking is an entry point for entrants using this strategy. As a side note, the low rate of transitions out of hybrid entrepreneurship and into full-time entrepreneurship (1.8%) is striking, and contrast with the higher rate (8.5%) observed by Folta et al. (2010) in the Swedish context. It is not clear what explains this result. While it is of secondary interest in the present study, it nevertheless calls for further explication in future research.",

Also, once we control for sample selection, being a homeowner is negatively related to homeworking overall and for the female self-employed subsample.

Homeworking can help explain the limited scale of most entrepreneurial ventures (Davidsson et al. 2009; Hurst and Pugsley 2011) and their surprisingly limited growth ambitions (Delmar and Wiklund 2008; Wiklund and Shepherd 2003). The logistical difficulties of operating a multi-person venture from a domestic property, together with the agency costs entailed by spatially separating employees from the entrepreneur owner-manager, could account for incompatibility between entrepreneurial homeworking and job creation. Combined with the prevalence and persistence of homeworking, the weak job creation performance of the self-employed may become more understandable.",

That could shed light on the impact of other policy instruments such as zoning laws and rent subsidies, which might also affect the entrepreneurial choices explored in this article. Mason et al. (2011) noted that planning laws, regulations, and tax rules were formulated decades or even centuries before the digital knowledge-based economy was envisaged. Policy changes may be needed to support home-based entrepreneurship in this new context, for example by allowing social housing residents to start home-based businesses to escape poverty and worklessness. The task of formulating detailed policies in this regard is likely to be complex and multi-faceted: we leave it to future work.",

First, the present paper abstracted from several important considerations, including endogenous worker mobility, entrepreneur mobility, and the determination of business office rents. Some prior research (e.g., Rosenthal and Strange 2012) has explored some of these issues, though not in the context of homeworking decisions. A fuller treatment of these issues would seem worthwhile. Second, among the empirical limitations of this article one may question the use of self-employment as a measure of entrepreneurship. It would be interesting to know whether the results obtained here continue to hold for alternative definitions of entrepreneurship; and to quantify the amount, type, and determinants of homeworking using alternative definitions. Third, it would be valuable to utilize data from other countries and investigate temporal variations and trends in the phenomenon of self-employed homeworking. These tasks are all left for future research.",

Thus, the paper should be regarded as exploratory and correlational in nature: it does not make strong claims about uncovering causal relationships. Fifth, our investigation did not exhaust all forms of risk-minimization strategies associated with homeworking. For instance, it is possible that some self-employed homeworkers organize as sole proprietors, and switch to incorporated status and non-homeworking. We lack the data to explore this possibility in our study, though we note that prior research suggests that this kind of transition is infrequent (\u00c5stebro and T\u00e5g 2017).",

More research is needed on this topic, in part to inform entrepreneurs and policymakers, and in part to build out scholarly understanding of entrepreneurship. Its prevalence alone makes it deserve of further attention; but one can also imagine a whole set of questions which researchers can explore anew by distinguishing between homeworker and non-homeworker entrepreneurs. For example, are borrowing constraints different for the two groups of entrepreneurs, and are the growth and survival prospects of their ventures different too? How does the growing trend of flexible \u201cgig economy\u201d working and multiple job holding (Adams et al. 2018) intersect with homeworking among the self-employed, and what are the likely directions this may take in the future? What are the regional impacts of homeworking in terms of economic development and living standards? These are all interesting questions which the homeworker distinction open up for fresh investigation, and which promise to generate further unexpected and fruitful insights.",
