The technique is also constantly evolving due to the development of ion sources and the construction of analyzers, improvements in the fragmentation process, and progress in software capabilities. Consequently, the application area is broadening. Starting as a tool to solve particular problems in physics and chemistry, from the mid\u20101980s, MS has become one of the essential tools for a broad range of sciences and industries. The dynamic development of \u201cbiological\u201d MS was initiated by the discovery of soft ionization techniques: electrospray by Yamashita and Fenn (1984) and matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) introduced by Tanaka et al. (1988). Both inventors were rewarded with a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002. Since the introduction of both ion sources into laboratory routine, we have observed milestone discoveries in life sciences, medicine, nanotechnologies, environmental protection, and chemistry, which would not be possible without mass spectrometers. Moreover, some fields were formed because this tool was created, and this includes proteomics, metabolomics, and tissue MS imaging.",

The interaction between the virus and the host which has developed over time is complex and sometimes unexpected. Thus, virology requires increasingly more sophisticated tools to progress. MS is one of the unique tools allowing us to look into the fate of the information delivered to the cell by a virus, and visualize the changing microenvironment of the infected cell. Some of the applications of MS encompass the physicochemical characterization of virions and viral proteins during the infection, evaluation of the interactions between viral proteins and between viral and cellular proteins, analysis of proteome alterations in the infected cell, and the design and testing of the efficacy and cytotoxicity of antivirals. A separate branch includes high molecular weight (MW) measurements of the whole viruses and identification of their assembly dynamics during capsid formation in a time\u2010dependent manner. Using this technique, it is possible to observe the formation of capsids and them filling with nucleic acids, providing insight into the fascinating process of viral replication. In such cases, MS achieves new frontiers in the mass measurement range, almost reaching mass values of the microscopic objects.",

In some cases, especially in medical applications, the time required for the identification of the pathogen is a critical factor for the application of appropriate therapies. To date, MS has been routinely used for the identification of infectious microorganisms, but current MS\u2010based approaches could also be effective toward the identification of viruses infecting humans. As some viral infections develop relatively rapidly and, due to their high infectivity, pose a threat to the human or animal population, fast methods of detection of the etiological factor are required. However, such analyses seem to be difficult due to viral biology, as only scarce amounts of viral proteins are present in body fluids during the early stages of the infection. One may speculate that the infection may be sensed earlier, by the analysis of antigens presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) by infected cells; however, analytical approaches identifying such presentations are missing thus far. A similar analysis has also been carried out for the development of effective vaccines, which is another field in which virology and MS mingle. MS is used to design vaccines, but it is also used to verify the content and quality of this versatile medicinal products. Thus, the importance of MS in virology seems to be obvious, as combining those two fields offers new research perspectives. Although there are some reviews on this subject (Cobo, 2013; Greco et al., 2014), the area is developing rapidly, and any attempt to summarize the latest achievements may be helpful. Moreover, the broader presence of this subject to the scientists involved in MS may result in new solutions to the obstacles in this field.",

However, once they enter the host, they hijack the cellular machinery to serve their purpose, changing the cell into a virus factory that becomes invisible to defense systems. A virus particle carries information in the form of RNA or DNA, which, in complex with the capsid proteins, forms the viral core. This nucleocapsid is protected by the shell built of proteins (naked viruses) or a lipid bilayer (enveloped viruses), which protects the viral genetic material in the hostile extracellular environment. Regardless of the virus type, the shell is always decorated with the proteins responsible for attachment and entry to the host cell, which initiates the replication cycle.",

Each viral species is fitted to use a limited number of receptors, which is one of the most important determinants of tissue and species specificity. The binding initiates the complex process of virus entry, which ends up in the delivery of the viral genetic material to the replication site: the cytoplasm or the nucleus, where the replication starts. Viral proteins are expressed and initiate remodeling of the cell by the formation of intracellular structures serving as viral factories and protecting viral components from detection by the natural defense mechanisms. Eventually, the viral replication machinery initiates production of progeny nucleic acids, which interact with the capsid protein(s) forming nucleocapsids. These macromolecules are further matured, and the shell is formed. The release may occur simply due to the disruption of the host cell, but cellular transport routes are frequently utilized, and virions are slowly released to the extracellular space, which finalizes the viral cycle.",

(1960) during simulations of micrometeoroid behavior. CDMS focuses on the simultaneous measurement of the charge (z) and m/z ratio of the single ion rather than on the calculation of the MW of the molecules, based on the mass spectrum (Fuerstenau & Benner, 1995). Results are shown as a plot of MW (usually presented in MDa) as a function of the density of ions charges detected by the instrument (see Fig. 1). This methodology was adopted in the area of biological applications to molecular mass estimation of DNA (Schultz et al., 1998) and viruses (rice yellow mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus; Fuerstenau et al., 2001). Here, typical MS was also unable to directly measure MWs of such large objects. Instead, a smart modification of the mass spectrometer was applied: after ESI, highly charged, viral capsids were guided through an amplifier, able to estimate their total charge, which was proportional to the current measured. As an additional verification, the time of flight of the molecules measured in the time\u2010of\u2010flight (TOF) analyzer was evaluated. M/z ratios were calculated based on both measurements, allowing for the acceptable precision of the measurement.",

CDMS measures single ion parameters with a speed reaching 1,000 ions/min, which means that the time of analysis is long in comparison to other MS\u2010based techniques. Additionally, the resolution of CDMS is also limited, but in a measured range of MDa or even GDa, precise MW calculations has minor importance. Continuous improvement of this method is also observed, like in case of increase in sensitivity of CDMS using so called pulsed mode (Todd & Jarrold, 2019).",

            "text": "GEMMA is a method of molecule/particle diameter measurement, when applied to high MW objects like viruses. This works as a connection of electrospray or nanospray ion sources with a DMA. The principles of analysis using this approach were described in detail elsewhere (Kaufman et al., 1996; Guha et al., 2012; Pease, 2012; Campbell et al., 2015) Briefly, multiply charged ions formed after electrospraying are directed to the neutralizing chamber and then to the DMA (Kaufman et al., 1996). In the neutralizing chamber, ions interact with \u03b1\u2010particles generated by 210Po. Charge\u2010reduced molecules are traveling to DMA and there their electrical mobility diameter is measured. The result is given in nanometers, in contrast to the typical MS analyses (see Fig. 3), but in some cases can be graded in Da as well (see Fig. 2). The difference between DMA and typical IMS stays in ion trajectories. In DMA ion travel, trajectory is an effect of the interaction between electric field generated in analyzer electrodes and drift gas flow, moving ortogonally to the direction of ion travel, while ions move in the same trajectory in typical IMS, differing by the time of travel. It makes DMA analyzers similar to sector instruments allowing for work in the mass filter mode.",

            "text": "GEMMA is widely used in investigations related to viral interactions with eukaryotic cells. Specifically, it has been used to estimate the binding ratio between antibodies and viral capsids when conventional MS\u2010based methods failed. Bereszczak et al. (2014) used ESI\u2010Q\u2010TOF and ion mobility MS to measure MWs of antibody\u2010hepatitis virus complexes up to ca. 8 MDa with the additional validation of results with the aid of GEMMA and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo\u2010EM). As it would be difficult to directly measure molecular mass, based on Q\u2010TOF system in the given MW range, the authors successfully used estimations based on predicted charge load on the ionized molecules and verified the results with other methods (Bereszczak et al., 2014). Far earlier, the ESI\u2010GEMMA technique was developed as a convenient method for the analysis of high MW molecular complexes (Loo et al., 2005; Allmaier et al., 2008). Kaddis et al. (2007) have proven the usability of this methodology for the analysis of large molecules as well as high MW noncovalent complexes up to more than 9 MDa (Kaddis et al., 2007). Nowadays, GEMMA\u2010based systems seem to be reliable alternatives to other analytical methods, typically used in the investigations of interactions between big molecules. An excellent discussion of the advances of this technique is provided in the work of Havlik et al. where interactions between tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus and the vaccine formulations were investigated by various techniques. The authors compared results from GEMMA, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and TEM. They found that the size distribution pattern of viral capsids at various stages of vaccine preparation defines the behavior of capsids assembly dynamics significantly better than microscopic methods, which mainly comes from sample preparation methodology for each of the techniques. It seems that sample preparation for GEMMA is the least invasive and does not significantly affect the final result (Havlik et al., 2015). Compared with other methods used for molecular mass estimation, this technique is cheaper, less time consuming and simpler in application than concurrent techniques, like ESI\u2010TOF\u2010MS, CDMS (more time consuming), or microscopic techniques like TEM, AFM, cryo\u2010EM (higher costs, sophisticated sample preparation, result dependent on sample prep; Weiss et al., 2019).",

Some interesting data in the measurement range reaching even GDa have been shown by Hogan et al. (2006): during the electrospraying of bacteriophage MS2 with further analysis by DMA, the dimension of their capsids was estimated to be 24.13 \u00b1 0.06 nm. Measurements did not influence the viability of the phages, which was confirmed in bacterial cells, since phages were still able to infect Escherichia coli strains after electrospraying. The limit of measurement was rather related to physical frontiers of the ESI than to dimensions of the particles, that is, bigger phages, such as T2 or T4, were not fully covered by the solvent droplets during electrospray formation. This resulted in fragmentation and the complete loss of phage function. Furthermore, the authors were able to separately detect capsids and tails of phage Lambda. This observation verified the possibility of in\u2010source fragmentation of the bigger phages during ionization process, which was somehow related to dimensions of spraying droplets. Unfortunately, the exact fragmentation mechanism was not proposed and remains unknown.",

Moreover, in such types of mass spectrometer, ionization of the measured objects does not necessarily increase the quality of analysis. The system uses an electrospray ion source, or a surface acoustic wave nebulization source, but focusing and guiding of the particles measured is carried out based on molecule inertia rather than the charge. The authors of this experimental system obtained satisfactory results in the measurements range from ca. 20 to 110 MDa, analyzing empty capsids and those filled with phage DNA of the bacteriophage T5. It is also worth mentioning that polystyrene nanoparticles at a diameter of ca. 45 nm (validated by scanning electron microscopy) were used as a reference material.

The researchers employed LC\u2010MS/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), which allows the abundance of small molecules or group of proteins after their enzymatic digestion to be quantified based on the unique peptides released. Next, they monitored the protein content changes in virions upon heat\u2010induced disassembly, which was aimed to mimic the entry process. As a result, some proteins were identified as important players during virus release from the endosome to the cytosol (Benevento et al., 2014). Interestingly, MS studies on nonenveloped viruses revealed the usefulness of these methods evaluation of viral protein activity. Salganik and colleagues studied the adeno\u2010associated viruses (AAV) to identify proteolytic active sites which catalyze autolytic cleavage of viral capsids. The researchers employed LC\u2010MS/MS analysis to identify the cleavage sites within capsid proteins and to show that AAV particles contain an intrinsic protease activity that is activated in the acidic environment of cellular endosomal compartments. Using both mass spectrometric analysis and N\u2010terminal Edman sequencing, they identified unique autocleavage sites in AAV type 1 (AAV1) and AAV9. Results showed that AAV protease may have an important role in virus infection (Salganik et al., 2012). Furthermore, a direct LC\u2010MS/MS analysis proven to be effective in characterizing AAV capsid proteins (VPs) in variety of AAV serotypes (Jin et al., 2017). Soon after, Zhang et al. described a novel method to characterize AAV capsid proteins. A microfluidic ZipChip capillary electrophoresis linked to mass spectrometer (CE/MS) was employed for the identification of three AAV2 proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Researchers described the ZipChip CE/MS as a powerful method to confirm AAV serotype identity, which could support recombinant AAV gene therapy development (Zhang et al., 2018). Recently, MS techniques were also utilized in the analysis of the AAV capsid glycosylation profile. Aloor et al. employed high resolution MALDI\u2010TOF and identified N\u2010glycosylation of AAV8 capsid protein. These results showed that, contrary to previous data, AAV capsids are prone to glycosylation, which may influence AAV tropism (Aloor et al., 2018). In fact, MS\u2010based methods enable the robust characterization of N\u2010 and O\u2010linked glycans in complex virus samples, especially in glycoprofiling viral surface proteins (see also in posttranslational modification (PTM) analyses, subchapter IV.C and useability of glycan analysis in vaccine development, subchapter VIII.B).",

Further studies also described other host proteins that are incorporated into HIV\u20101 particles and interact specifically with viral proteins and these included Tsg101, cyclophilin A, and Apobec3G. All of these appeared to affect HIV\u20101 infection: Tsg101 plays a role in virus assembly, cyclophilin A regulates infectivity, whereas Apobec3G promotes hypermutation of HIV\u20101 genome, which causes lethal mutational loads that terminate progeny virus production and propagation (Franke et al., 1994; Braaten & Luban, 2001; Garrus et al., 2001; Demirov et al., 2002; Lecossier et al., 2003; Mangeat et al., 2003; Mariani et al., 2003).

The authors claimed that further analysis may demonstrate the importance of SARS\u2010CoV S N\u2010glycosylation in receptor recognition and virus entry to the cell, but a report by Chakraborti et al. showed that glycosylation of SARS\u2010CoV S did not influence virus binding to its entry receptor (Chakraborti et al., 2005). On the other hand, a few years later, Zhou et al. demonstrated that a single N\u2010glycosylation site in SARS\u2010CoV S is important for the interaction with the mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL)\u2014a serum protein involved in activating the complement system. The identified N\u2010linked glycosylation site N330 appeared to be critical for binding of S protein by MBL and further inhibition of virus infection.

For that reason, they undergo a constant antigenic drift (Medina et al., 2013; Herv\u00e9 et al., 2015). Consequently, alterations in protein sequence result in an escape from immune clearance but may also mask epitopes, for example, changing the glycosylation pattern. Cruz et al. studied the glycosylation patterns of the HA protein. Researchers employed a high\u2010energy collision dissociation (HCD) and collision\u2010induced dissociation tandem MS (HCD/CID\u2010MS/MS) for characterization of the site\u2010specific profile of HA from A/New Caledonia strain (Cruz et al., 2018).

These small (approximately 50 nm in diameter) enveloped viruses include over 40 pathogenic human species of flavivirus and hepacivirus genera. Viruses egress from infected cells through a secretory pathway. During this process, viral particles undergo diverse maturation steps, such as glycosylation or proteolysis (Voisset & Dubuisson, 2004; Fields et al., 2013). Additionally, a recent study by Rana et al. investigated the role of a capsid anchor (CA)\u2014a hydrophobic peptide of a capsid protein, in the morphogenesis of ZIKV. Previously, CA was considered to direct the pre\u2010membrane protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the study showed that CA has another function, as it controls E protein stability and availability. Thus, CA expression is believed to be necessary for the production of infectious ZIKV particles (Rana et al., 2018). Glycosylation and proteolysis also enables the incorporation of host proteins into the viral capsids, as shown for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by Lussignol et al. Using different purification methods and LC\u2010MS/MS, researchers identified 46 host proteins in HCV particles. Among several new host factors, a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein was identified and further showed to participate in HCV infection (Lussignol et al., 2016). Thus, despite the protein composition of HCV still not being well described, it is believed that cellular proteins are important components of the virus particle (Pawlotsky, 2013). Future MS based studies on host proteins incorporated into virions should broaden current knowledge on other Flaviviridae members, such as ZIKV or West Nile virus (WNV).",

This PTM has been described as being important for the regulation of transcription and cell stress, DNA repair, and tumorigenesis (Golebiowski et al., 2009; Bertolotto et al., 2011; Kessler et al., 2012; Sahin et al., 2014). Studying the SUMOylation of viral proteins is difficult, as this process is dynamic during infection and SUMOylated proteins are usually of low abundance. For this reason, MS has been employed as an accurate and sensitive tool to detect and identify SUMOylated viral proteins. For example, the analysis of SUMOylated proteins was performed for HSV\u20101\u2010infected cells and revealed a decrease in the SUMOylation of specific antiviral proteins, which may suggest that modulation of the virus replication microenvironment enhances the infection (Sloan et al., 2015). Similarly, Li et al. demonstrated that the EBV infection suppresses global cellular SUMOylation to facilitate the virus lytic replication. On the other hand, SUMOylation has been shown to be an important factor for influenza A virus infection. Viral proteins interact with the host SUMOylation system to facilitate their modification and, consequently, improve the replication process. SUMOylation of influenza nucleoproteins is necessary for protein intracellular trafficking, while modification of the virus nonstructural protein NS1 enables the neutralization of interferon production (Santos et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014). Interestingly, in a more recent work by Dominigues et al., quantitative proteomics showed a unique re\u2010SUMOylation of 63 host proteins in response to influenza virus infection.

As such, genomes are relatively short, and the cleavage sites of viral polyproteins to release active proteins can be predicted, it allows for fast estimation of protein composition in newly discovered virus.

Similarly, the same comparison was made for the LLC\u2010MK2 cells infected with mentioned viruses and for uninfected cells. This allows viral biomarkers to be found\u2014the peaks characteristic for each cultivated serotype\u2014and to create an in\u2010house viral protein database. The analysis of the cells infected with the poliovirus strains isolated from clinical samples and their proper identification showed the potential of this analytical technology based on MALDI analysis for virus identification (Calderaro et al., 2016). In the next study, the team continued the research and analyzed the most common viruses causing respiratory tract infections (influenza A and B viruses; adenovirus C; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; echovirus; CMV; and human metapneumovirus). As previously reported, the cell culture step was included to amplify the signal, since the amount of analyte present in the sample is the major limitation of current MALDI protocols (Calderaro et al., 2016). For each virus, the spectra for uninfected and infected samples were compared and peaks that differentiated those two in the MW range from 2,000 to 1,1500 Da were indicated. Those peaks may represent the virus\u2010specific proteins or might be the effect of the cell line response for the infection. Hence, the list of peaks was used to create the main spectrum profile (MSP) for each reference virus. The library that consists of all the MSP was then used to identify viruses from 58 clinical samples. The signal was initially amplified in the cell culture and further analyzed. The proposed system was able to discriminate between seven different viruses. In the case of influenza, it was possible to identify the sample as human influenza virus, but distinguishing between species A and B was not possible. The same problem occurred for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Mentioned studies showed that a MALDI\u2010based approach can be used for virus analysis, despite some limitations, and could lead to the reduction of the time and costs of the analysis in comparison with classical methods.",

Here, high resolution and high mass accuracy (of 1\u20135 ppm) spectra are required (Schwahn et al., 2009). Initially, translated gene sequences for influenza HA, neuroamidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein M1 of all viral strains isolated from humans were used as an input (type A H1\u2014931 sequences; type A H3\u20142,814; type B HA\u20141,057; B type Vic87\u2010like\u2014424; and B type Yam88\u2010like\u2014629 sequences). With the aid of bioinformatics tools, the masses of their theoretical tryptic peptides were obtained and matched. Then, the peptides characteristic for certain type and subtype of the virus (signature peptides) from each viral protein were chosen. The care was taken to choose the most conserved peptides for each type and subtype with the masses that differ by the largest value from theoretical tryptic peptides of all known influenza antigens whose sequences are not conserved. For example, the peptide with the mass 593.307520 (SSIMR) comes from HA and is characteristic for type A and subtype H3 of influenza virus. Such mass identified in the spectrum from the whole virus digest may correctly identify the strain and subtype but the data has to be acquired with the aid of a high\u2010resolution mass spectrometer, for example, MALDI FT\u2010ICR (Downard, 2013). This approach may be used for the analysis of mixed strain proteins in the vaccines, to distinguish seasonal from pandemic influenza strains and to determine currently circulating strains, which is essential for the production of effective vaccines.",

Moreover in this case, PCR due to its nature, allows to increase the amount of the measured material (Metzgar et al., 2013). In the microbiological analysis, the primers are designed to bind to conserved regions present in about 95% of all the bacteria and amplify heterogeneous regions between the primer sites. Such an approach is more difficult for viruses, which are characterized by higher diversity and it is not possible to design broad\u2010range primers for general diagnostics. However, the in silico analysis of the influenza virus sequences allowed the selection of primers in conserved regions of the core gene segments that allows for detection of all known influenza viruses and distinguish >90% of all species and types (Sampath et al., 2005). Following the RT\u2010PCR amplification, the sample was desalted and analyzed with the electrospray. Sufficient mass accuracy of PCR amplicons allows for the unambiguous determination of the base composition (i.e., the number of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts) of each amplicon, which allows for the identification of the pathogen. The complementary nature of the DNA strains (in the case of DNA viruses) make such analysis possible at the level accuracy of around 20 ppm (see Table 1), but such analysis is also possible for RNA viruses (Sampath et al., 2007). Moreover, new pathogens may be assigned to the viral family based on the conserved primers. Such primers allow for the efficient PCR from all the members of the certain family, whereas the base composition is able to indicate the new member. In the case of SARS, it was shown that this approach was able to categorize it as a new member of the coronavirus family, based on the coronavirus primers designed and tested before its emergence (Sampath et al., 2005).",

In the Ibis T5000 Respiratory Virus Surveillance II kit, used in this study, 16 primer pairs were distributed in a 96\u2010well plate, in which each well contained one pair of primers, which allowed for the analysis of six patients per plate. Clinical samples collected and analyzed before, with classical clinical virological methods were used. This study proved the usefulness of the new technique, since it was characterized by 87.9% accuracy in comparison with conventional clinical virology assays, and was able to identify viruses in the samples previously unidentified. In particular, for RSV, 34 samples were positively identified with both RT\u2010PCR/ESI\u2010MS and clinical virology (rapid immunochromatographic tests), three samples unidentified by clinical virology were positively identified with RT\u2010PCR/ESI\u2010MS (the positive identification of two of them was further confirmed by another PCR\u2010based platform) and two were misidentified with RT\u2010PCR/ESI\u2010MS, but their identification with clinical virology was correct. Additionally, the method was shown to be sensitive, rapid (time to detection, 8 hr) and was able to detect simultanously multiple pathogens. Sampath et al.

In AP\u2010MS assay bait protein is immobilized on a solid support such as magnetic beads or agarose, prey proteins are in the solution. In this case different types of baits such as specific antibodies, proteins with attached tag can be used (like: FLAG, HIS\u2010tag, MYC, HA, GFP, streptavidin). After the affinity step proteins are digested with enzymes (proteases such as trypsin), the obtained peptides can be analyzed using the UPLC system connected with mass spectrometer. The AP\u2010MS assay belongs to the group of library\u2010independent methods, and is a universal technique allowing the usage of a wide group of molecules acting as baits. The application of a complex protocol involving cell lysis, purification, eliminates the possibility of detection spatial, temporal, weak, and transient PPIs. The development of PPI research strategies which are combined with tandem MS has become an important and powerful approach during interactome study. Various types of AP\u2010MS assays have been introduced over time. Particular assays differ by the types of tags and the types of protein purification methods (Dunham et al., 2012). In native AP\u2010MS, proteins are fused with antibody and linked to the magnetic beads or agarose. The antibody binds to the selected protein and forms an immunocomplex while unbound proteins are washed away. This assay requires high purity antibodies directed exactly against the prey protein (Gillen & Nita\u2010Lazar, 2019). Taylor and Knipe (2004) used the native AP\u2010MS method to identify 50 both cellular and viral proteins that interact with viral DNA\u2010binding protein ICP8, important in the HSV\u20101 genome replication (Taylor & Knipe, 2004). Gillen et al. used the AP\u2010MS technique to study the interaction of a protein involved in inhibiting the host's immune response against the Kaposi's KSHV. Applying the a group of selected monoclonal antibodies and MS for identification, the binding sites of the ORF45\u2010binding protein were found (Gillen et al., 2015). As specific antibodies availability is limited in some cases, the introduction of GFP protein as a tag significantly simplified this problem. The main advantage of GFP is that the signal from this protein can confirm the expression of proteins of interest, being helpful in mapping the intracellular location of prey proteins. Munday et al. used GFP AP\u2010MS method for investigation the cellular interactomes of the human respiratory syncytial virus L\u2010 and P\u2010proteins. The GFP AP\u2010MS approach showed that HSP90 and several other chaperones are involved in the replication of the viral genome by binding to polymerase and stabilizing L\u2010protein (Munday et al., 2015). As shown by Crow et al., during HSV\u20101 infection, the IFIX protein responsible for the inhibition of expression of viral genes is bound by several E3\u2010ubiquitin ligases which degrades the host's immunity proteins. Magnetic beads connected with anti\u2010GFP antibodies were used for affinity purifications and analyzed using MS. The identified IFIX interactions were verified by comparing biological replications of IFIX\u2010GFP complex and pure GFP as a control using SAINT algorithms (Crow & Cristea, 2017).",

The use of a basic TAP tag with a high MW (21 kDa) has an adverse effect on the folding, activity and interaction of proteins; therefore, numerous modifications of the used tags have been introduced. Changing the tags to SF\u2010TAP (streptavidin II and FLAG) resulted in a weight reduction to 4.6 kDa. Depending on the assay, different tag combinations are used (Rigaut et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2001). Applying the TAP\u2010MS methodology (Eberle et al., 2014) examined the effects of viral HCV nonstructural protein (NS) 5A, responsible for interference with cellular pathways and the regulation of viral RNA replication. In total, 274 proteins were identified in this experiment; the CRAPome platform was used to verify protein interactions. As a final result, 24 high confidence proteins were obtained (see Fig. 7). Among them, fifteen were confirmed by an independent research group in another experiment (Germain et al., 2014). Germain et al. applied IP\u2010MS/MS approach and ectopic expression of individually FLAGG\u2010tagged HCV proteins such as Core, NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. All baits were tagged at the N\u2010terminal, only NS4B was tagged at the C\u2010terminal. Ninety\u2010eight proteins were identified, including 74 new proteins, not previously described in the literature. The use of IP\u2010western blotting confirmed eleven new virus\u2010host interactions and gene silencing during HCV\u2010associated proteins investigation, which allowed for the identification of eleven partners that are new modulators of HCV replication (Fig. 8).",

Most of the experimental methods are time\u2010consuming, expensive, require special equipment and have a high rate of false\u2010positive results. During the past decade many computational methods have been designed to meet the challenge. Computational methods can be used to predict protein complexes based on PPI network analysis and network integration with various additional data, such as a gene function, PTMs modifications, coexpression or other introduced parameters. Various algorithms are available; however, all computational methods are based on several major assumptions such as assigning relevant scores to identified interactions, recognition of complexes by grouping available PPI networks or inclusion of additional data in the analysis and evaluation of the obtained complexes by comparison with the so\u2010called golden standard datasets. However, so far, no existing method is able to predict efficiently the entire human, or other mammalian interactomes. Difficulties are provided by: instabilities in PPIs, the complexity of processes in which the selected protein is involved, dynamic changes that occur in cells (Rao et al., 2014). Experimental and predicted PPIs are collected in a number of different databases which are available on\u2010line, such as database of interacting proteins accessed at: http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu (Xenarios et al., 2000), FPCLASS (Interactions and Properties of Human Proteins) accessed at: http://ophid.utoronto.ca/fpclass/ (Kotlyar et al., 2015), HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database) accessed at: http://www.hprd.org/, IntAct (Molecular Interaction Database) accessed at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact (Hermjakob et al., 2004), iRefWeb a web interface to protein interaction data accessed at: http://wodaklab.org/iRefWeb (Turner et al., 2010), STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) accessed at: http://string-db.org/ (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), BioGrid (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets) accessed at: https://thebiogrid.org/ (Oughtred et al., 2019). Reference maps of interactions have been created to better understand cellular functions. Open reading frames (Wiemann et al., 2016) enabled progress in interaction mapping. So far, several maps have been published: BioPlex (Huttlin et al., 2015), Qubic (Hein et al., 2015), CoFrac\u201015 (Wan et al., 2015), HI_11_14 and novel generation HI\u2010III\u201019 (Rolland et al., 2014) and HuRi (The Human Reference Protein Interactome Mapping Project). HuRi is the first human binary reference interactome map described by Luck et al. HuRi was generated by screening 90% of proteins coded in the human genome for binary PPIs by applying the Y2H assay. The integration of HuRi with different types of data such as the proteome, the transcriptome, and the genome allow the investigation of physiological and pathological cellular aspects.",

However, this effect is often not sufficient to control the infection and, in some cases, may result in antibody\u2010mediated enhancement of the infection. Further, the rapid evolution of viral pathogens results in the emergence of escape mutants due to changes in highly variable viral surface proteins in terms of the primary sequence but also due to PTM (e.g., glycosylation). To develop a vaccine that can also induce cell\u2010mediated responses it is essential to identify epitopes that are effectively presented in the context of MHC I and MHC II. Efforts to predict such epitopes in silico were undertaken, but due to the high variability of MHC molecules and unobvious rules of peptide presentation, the reliability of these methods is limited.

In such cases, analysis of the peptidome presented in the context of the MHC starts with the expression of viral proteins or infection with the virus (Lorente et al., 2019). Cells are then lysed, and MHC molecules are being pulled down using monoclonal antibodies allowing for the distinction of different MHC classes. Peptides associated with the MHC molecules are further released in acidic conditions and further analyzed by LC\u2010MS/MS. Obtained data are searched against databases of viral proteomes, and peptides are mapped (Meiring et al., 2006; Weidanz et al., 2007). Importantly, this approach also allows for mapping of epitopes that are modified posttranslationally. Exemplary, (Mulherkar et al., 2018) isolated the MHC I associated peptidome using monoclonal antibody affinity purification, and then identified peptidome compounds by nanoLC\u2010orbitrap\u2010MS. The authors identified and confirmed six novel MHC\u2010I restricted epitopes that were able to bind to HLA\u2010A2 and HLA\u2010A24 alleles and used in vitro and in vivo methods to generate CD8+ T cells specific for each of these peptides. Wu et al. (2019) used LC\u2010MS/MS, also in the MRM mode, and identified 21 peptides derived from the influenza A virus proteins presented by immunocompetent cells with the further estimation of the response level of T cells. In similar experiments, 25 epitopes were found from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV\u20106B) presented in the MHC II context. They were able to activate T cells recruiting from CD3+ and CD4+ subpopulations. In natural conditions, observed T\u2010cells reactivity toward presented antigens, identified during the investigation, allows controlling HHV\u20106B infection at a reasonable level (Becerra\u2010Artiles et al., 2019). Ternette et al. (2016) immunoprecipitated peptides bound to HLA class I complexes from HIV\u20101\u2010infected primary CD4+ T cells and C8166 cell lines, and further identified those by LC\u2010MS/MS. A similar work was previously carried out, but the researchers here used primary T\u2010cells infected with HIV\u20101 for the first time, which improves the reliability of the results (Hickman et al., 2003; Yaciuk et al., 2014).

The more sophisticated analysis was described by Xie et al. (2011), who shows the benefits of LC\u2010MS for characterization and monitoring of a recombinant influenza candidate vaccine formulated from purified rHA antigens. Application of this method allowed for the identification of impurities in the preparation, verification of rHA primary sequence, analysis of PTMs of the rHA and assessment of protein degradation. Similarly, Creskey et al. described an LC\u2010MS method for the simultaneous quantification of HA and NA content in influenza vaccines (Creskey et al., 2012; McKnight et al., 2017). The developed technique has the potential to determine the precise HA content in vaccines and to increase the accuracy of reference antigen standards. It can also be used to monitor manufacturing consistency by assessment of other protein content, as NA or chicken egg proteins. This is especially important, as the HA/NA content is one of the major parameters describing the viability of the virus; these two proteins are major targets for neutralizing antibodies. The importance of such analyses was shown by Brgles et al. (2016) who compared the protein and lipid composition of mumps viruses, showing that the research model may severely affect the vaccine contents. Furthermore, MS allows for the analysis of vaccine contaminants, as described by Lei et al.

Both, N\u2010 and O\u2010glycosylation form a shield on the viral capsid proteins that is one of the most important modulators of immunogenicity, but which also affects protein folding and the consequent solubility (Varki et al., 2015). The glycosylation pattern differs significantly between different cell types and between organisms. Even more importantly, glycosylation patterns are important for the recognition (or lack of recognition) of viral epitopes by our immune system. This is mostly relevant for heterologous expression systems, where the viral protein is immunogenic but does not elicit protective immune responses. For that reason, vaccine antigens are often produced in mammalian cells, despite the high cost and low expression efficiency. Analysis of the glycan shield is a difficult task due to the high heterogeneity of the polymers and high flexibility of sugar chains. Developments in MS allowed for the precise mapping of protein glycosylation and other PTMs, which could enhance vaccine effectiveness in the near future (Wyatt et al., 1998; Helle et al., 2010; Machiels et al., 2011; Burton & Hangartner, 2016; Cao et al., 2017; Lavie et al., 2018).",
