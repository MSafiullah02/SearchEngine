(https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/covid-19questions-answers/) One infected person (even asymptomatic) can transmit the disease to more than 400 patients in 30 days. Because it is transmitted from host to host, keeping it away from a host will cause its own death (decay). This can be achieved through a lockdown.",

Results of a scientific data model indicate that there was a negative correlation in the predicted number of cases with temperatures from 1\u00b0C and above (Fig. 1 ). An increase in the average temperature from 1 to 9\u00b0C was associated with a decrease in predicted cases from 24 to 19. Similarly, an increase in the average temperature from 10 to 19\u00b0C was associated with a decrease from 18 to 7 cases [3] .",

With the incubation temperature increased to 70\u00b0C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5 min [4] . For most animals, the melting point of lipids is between 20 and 40\u00b0C. In the case of SARS-CoV2 being zoonotic, it is presumed that the melting point of its lipid layer should be around 40\u00b0C, resulting in its faster decay during the summer.",
