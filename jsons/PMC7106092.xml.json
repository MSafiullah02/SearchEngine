Members of the genus Orthoreovirus have been isolated from a broad range of mammalian, avian, and reptilian hosts (Fields et al., 2001, Jackson and Muldoon, 1973, Rosen et al., 1960). The mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) were first isolated from humans in 1951. These viruses commonly infected humans but are rarely pathogenic in adults (Tyler et al., 2004). However, recent studies have demonstrated that reoviruses that spilled over from wild animals can cause acute and severe clinical disease in humans (Cheng et al., 2009, Chua et al., 2007, Chua et al., 2008, Chua et al., 2011). These recent discoveries have raised concerns about future zoonotic reovirus infections in humans and also demonstrated the need to better understand virus-host interactions.",

Feng et al. reported that the induction of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by exogenous ALV infection regulated viral entry (Feng et al., 2011). PI3K activation was required for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of CD4+ T-cells, and the suppression of PI3K signaling reduced HIV infection post-viral entry and post-reverse transcription, but prior to HIV gene expression (Francois and Klotman, 2003). The activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a strategy for Zaire Ebola virus to regulate vesicular trafficking and cellular entry (Saeed et al., 2008). Influenza A virus NS1 protein activated the PI3K/Akt pathway to augment its efficient replication (Ehrhardt et al., 2007, Shin et al., 2007). The direct relevance of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to reovirus infection is currently unknown.",

Studies have demonstrated that type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) enhance p53 transcription, and p53 also contributes to the immune responses that lead to the eradication of pathogens, such as viruses (Takaoka et al., 2003). p53 is involved in influenza virus-induced cell death, and inhibiting p53 could increase viral replication (Turpin et al., 2005). Another study demonstrated that p53 plays a crucial role in the cellular innate defence against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Dharel et al., 2008). However, the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) could down-regulate p53 in infected cells (Marques et al., 2005). Moreover, the absence of p53 inhibits the replication of both EMCV and HPIV3 (Marques et al., 2005). The role of p53 in reovirus infection is of concern.",

Our study found that Akt can be phosphorylated in a PI3K-dependent manner early during infection, and the blockage of Akt activation could promote viral replication. Following the induction of PI3K/Akt, the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated during reovirus infection. The up-regulation of p53 using an inhibitor or the overexpression of p53 in cells increased reovirus production, and knockdown of p53 by siRNA reduced reovirus replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 is involved in the regulation of mammalian reovirus replication.",

To further analyze the downstream effectors of Akt responsible for the defence against viral infection, we examined the expression of phosphorylated MDM2 and p53 upon reovirus infection. After infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 significantly increased from 6 to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3\nA) and recovered to the normal level at 32 p.i. Under non-stressed conditions, the MDM2 protein tightly regulates p53 via an autoregulatory feedback loop (Vassilev et al., 2004). Phosphorylated MDM2 serves as an ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 degradation (Vassilev et al., 2004). Because reovirus infection increased the level of phosphorylated MDM2, the expression of p53 was inhibited from 6 h to 28 h p.i. (Fig. 3B). To examine whether both p-MDM2 and p53 were regulated in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner, cells pre-treated with the inhibitor LY or transfected with siRNA targeting Akt were infected with MPC/04, and the levels of both genes were analyzed at 12 h p.i. As expected, LY treatment (Fig. 3C) or the knockdown of Akt (Fig. 3D) decreased p-MDM2 expression and increased p53 expression compared with mock treatment. These results indicated that reovirus infection activated the PI3K/Akt/MDM2/p53 pathway.",

Furthermore, the knockdown of p53 led to a 92% decrease in viral RNA (Fig. 5C) and 1.6 log PFU/mL-fold decrease in the viral titer (Fig. 5D). The inhibition of MDM2/p53 by Nutlin was expected to increase the expression of p53 and promoted viral replication. However, Nutlin treatment did not increase viral replication when p53 was knocked down (Fig. 5E and F). In contrast, viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 5E) and virus replication (Fig. 5F) was reduced, indicating that p53 was required to regulate reovirus replication via PI3K/Akt.",

            "text": "The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in cell growth and survival. The PI3K/Akt pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the replication of many viruses. The blockage of PI3K/Akt during infection with the ALV, vaccinia virus, and other viruses inhibits viral replication, but we observed that PI3K/Akt pathway activation antagonized rather than supported the virus. While the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the replication of many viruses, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which PI3K/Akt regulates viral replication are not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that the downstream effector MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt was activated during reovirus infection, which inhibited p53 expression in cells. The up-regulation of p53 using inhibitors or the overexpression of p53 in cells promoted reovirus replication, and the knockdown of p53 by siRNA inhibited reovirus replication. Studies demonstrated that type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) regulate p53 transcription, and p53 also promotes the immune responses that lead to the inhibition of viral replication. However, the replication of both EMCV and HPIV3 was inhibited after the down-regulation of p53 (Marques et al., 2005), which is consistent with our results. In our study, Nutlin treatment did not affect IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression (data not shown) suggesting that type I interferons did not play a role in regulating reovirus replication. The activation of PI3K, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit p110 and an adaptor/regulatory subunit p85 (Ram and Ethier, 1996), leads to Akt activation. Phosphorylated Akt inactivates several pro-apoptotic proteins, including GSK-3\u03b2, to promote cell survival (Cross et al., 1995). Akt activation leads to MDM2 phosphorylation and then inhibits p53 transcription (Pan et al., 2011), which results in cell survival. p53 accumulation significantly enhanced reovirus-induced apoptosis, virus release and dissemination (Pan et al., 2011), which may be a key factor for increasing reovirus production. Another study from Zhe Liu\u2019s research group showed that the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway facilitates hepatitis C virus entry (Liu et al., 2012). A significant increase in p53 was observed 6 h p.i., indicating that p53 may play a role during viral replication. However, this does not necessarily rule out the possible role of the PI3K/Akt pathway and p53 in reovirus entry. Because the virus attachment and adsorption may be inhibited during the second wave of virus infection by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and then reducing the p53 level. This could be a potential mechanism for p53 regulating reovirus infection.",
