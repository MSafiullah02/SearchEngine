Ang-1 and Ang-2 are ligands for the endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. Tie-2 is expressed throughout the surface of endothelial cells and has low activity [4]. Ang-2 antagonizes Tie-2, and Ang-1 activates Tie-2. Tie-2 activation helps decrease vascular permeability and prevents endothelial cell death [5, 6]. Ang-2 is normally stored in Weibel\u2013Palade bodies and is rapidly released upon stimulation to mediate endothelium activation and sensitize endothelial response to inflammatory cytokines [7, 8]. Ang-2 levels increase in septic shock and are associated with vascular leakage and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9]. Whether Ang-2 is also associated with EV71-induced PE remains unknown.",

The mechanism of EV71-induced PE remains unclear. One study reported that in PE caused by elevated pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, the P/S ratio of total protein is less than 0.60, whereas the P/S ratio of albumin is less than 0.7 [12]. In the present study, the authors found that the P/S ratio of total protein was 0.9 \u00b1 0.2, and the P/S ratios of albumin were greater than 1.0 \u00b1 0.3, which indicated that EV71-induced PE is associated with increased pulmonary capillary permeability. Wu et al. used pulmonary artery catheterization to monitor pulmonary circulation hemodynamics in 5 infants with EV71-induced PE and found that pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were normal or slightly elevated [3], which suggested that PE is not caused by elevated hydrostatic pressure of pulmonary capillaries. The present clinical data showed that infants with PE had noticeable tachycardia, high blood pressure, and other signs of symptomatic nervous system; however, myocardial enzymogram, the images of heart and left ventricle ejection fraction were basically normal. Treatments such as heart strengthening and diuresis had no effect. Therefore, none of these clinical data support the hypothesis that EV71-induced PE is associated with elevated hydrostatic pressure.",

The endothelial cells incubated with serum from infants with PE showed the same results; however, these changes were not noted in cells incubated with serum from control group infants. Endothelial cells normally connect with one another through cell adhesion molecules [16], and VE-cadherin is one of the adhesive proteins necessary for maintaining vascular integrity. The VE-cadherin molecule is related to F-actin. When inflammatory mediators stimulate the endothelium, F-actin rearranges and centripetal tension increases. Changes in the F-actin skeleton affect the endothelial connections and lead to the formation of gaps in the endothelium, thereby increasing permeability [17].",
