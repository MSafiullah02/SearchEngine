Some of them had been established with T-even bacteriophages, which at the time had been studied in much greater detail than animal viruses. The phages were known to have proteins that bound to cell surface \u201creceptors\u201d on specific host bacteria. Interaction with the receptors triggered conformational changes in the virus particles. The result was perforation of the bacterial cell wall and ejection of the viral DNA genome and some proteins into the cytosol.",

However, influenza and paramyxoviruses were known to use sialic acid residues as receptors, and have sialidase activity for receptor destruction [2]. It was generally assumed that other animal viruses used a variety of receptors explaining the observed differences in cell tropism and host range. Identification of additional receptors took place later: The HIV virus receptor CD4 on T cells and the Epstein\u2013Barr virus receptor CR2 on B cells were identified in 1984 [3], [4], the poliovirus receptor CD155 in 1989 [5], and the coxsackie adenovirus virus receptor in 1997 [6].",

For many viruses, the high particle to plaque-forming unit (a measure of virus infectivity) ratio makes analysis of entry difficult still today.

Being pH independent, such fusion reactions are triggered by interactions with one or more cell surface receptors. HIV-1, a lentivirus, needs two cell surface receptors that induce successive changes in the conformation of the fusion-active glycoprotein. In the case of paramyxoviruses and herpes viruses, fusion is usually triggered by interactions between receptor-binding viral spike glycoproteins and distinct metastable viral fusion proteins [20]. For the fusion activation mechanism, different models are being discussed [21].",

In the plasma membrane, tetraspanins are known to organize locally into dynamic, ordered clusters and microdomains (tetraspanin-enriched microdomains) that contain, in addition to tetraspanins, selections of surface proteins [34], [35]. Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains play a role in cell adhesion, migration, fusion, signaling, vesicle traffic, and other processes. Also in virus infection, they seem to have multiple functions including receptor presentation, exposure of viruses to proteolytic activators, signaling, clathrin-independent endocytosis, and post-endocytic events such as endosome maturation [33].

In addition to its bona fide receptor (DPP2), this corona virus requires exposure to protease; either a TTSP family member on the plasma membrane or cathepsins in endolysosomes. These cleave the viral fusion protein and activate membrane fusion. Studies with mouse lung-adapted Middle East respiratory syndrome virus in tissue culture and in vivo show that infection efficiency is elevated by tetraspanin CD9 because it links the DPP2 and TMPRSS2 (a TTPS protease) into a ternary complex [36]. That these entry factors are associated with each other and concentrated in microdomains ensures rapid processing of incoming virus, efficient infection, and higher virulence. Clinical isolates of the related human coronavirus-229E also require CD9. Unlike tissue culture adapted strains, they prefer activation by TMPRSS2 on the cell surface over activation by cathepsin L in late endocytic compartments [37]. A likely explanation is that by elevating the concentration of receptor and TMPRSS2 locally, CD9 promotes early activation, which in turn allows entry without passage into late endocytic compartments. The virus avoids inactivation, exposure to interferon induced factors, and detection by Toll-like receptors that can activate cellular innate immunity.",

To those of us who followed viruses after endocytosis, it was clear that coated vesicles did not deliver the virus particles and other cargo directly to lysosomes but rather to uncoated, large vacuoles largely devoid of luminal material.

Rhabdo- and alphaviruses undergo acid-activated fusion in early endosomes where the pH is about 6.2. When the threshold pH is below 6.0 as it is for influenza A virus, delivery to late compartments is required.

The awkwardly named \u201cdendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) grabbing nonintegrin\u201d (DC-SIGN) is one of these lectins [93]. It binds and internalizes a broad range of viruses that carry high mannose N-linked glycans in their envelope glycoproteins. Viruses introduced into the skin through insect bites and other mechanisms take advantage of DC-SIGN in dendritic cells to promote dissemination from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs [94]. We have observed DC-SIGN clustering by surface-bound bunya viruses in real time followed by internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [76]. In this case, the lectin not only serves as an attachment factor but as an authentic receptor.",

Influenza viruses occur in two forms: spherical and filamentous. While the spherical particles mainly enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis, the larger filamentous forms use macropinocytosis [95], [96]. The particles are presumably too large to use the other two mechanisms. A consideration seldom addressed in virus entry studies is the possibility that virus aggregates may enter cells by mechanisms other than single particles [97], [98]. Aggregates may exist in the inoculum or they may form on the cell surface during high multiplicity infection.",

During coevolution with their hosts, they have developed a modus operandi that is based on profound adaptation to the host(s). During cell entry, they profit from deep insights into the broad spectrum of signals and conduits by which cells in multicellular organisms interact with each other and the outside world. Receptors, signaling, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking are all part of a refined machinery that viruses take advantage of. Viruses make use of their \u201cinsider information\u201d not only for entry and replication but also to avoid cellular defenses, to support different routes of transmission from organism to organism and between tissues in the body, to provide back-up systems, and to expand and adjust tropism. That virus/host cell interactions during entry are often redundant and adaptable is a challenge for our efforts to develop antiviral strategies. However, it is an inherent part of the life-style of many viruses.",
