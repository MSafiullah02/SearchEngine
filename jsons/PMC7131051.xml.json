These findings are of note because of the ongoing intertwined epidemics in Hartford (and elsewhere) of two sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the study's target age and ethnic groups as well as a third disease, AIDS, for which sexual contact is a primary route of transmission. Findings from this Centers for Disease Control (CDC) funded study, entitled Project PHRESH.comm (Philadelphia and Hartford Research Effort on Sexual Health and Communication), suggest key cultural and contextual factors underlying the spread of these STDs in the city. The analysis presented is framed by syndemic theory (Freudenberg, Fahs, Galea, & Greenberg, 2006; Singer, 1996; Singer & Clair, 2003), which seeks to elucidate the tendency for multiple, co-terminus and interacting epidemics to develop under conditions of health and social disparity. As Easton (2004, p. 211) notes, \u201cThe concept of syndemics is useful for understanding how sociocultural, historical, and geographical, realities in urban areas interact with and compound the adverse consequences of disease.\u201d",

This approach proved useful historically in focusing medical attention on the immediate causes and expressions of disease and contributed to the emergence of modern biomedical treatments, some of which have been enormously successful. However, as the compendium of knowledge has advanced, it has become increasingly clear that diseases do not necessarily exist in isolation from other diseases and conditions, that disease interactions are of considerable importance to disease course and consequence, and that the social conditions of disease sufferers are critical to understanding health impacts at the individual and population levels. Rather than existing as discrete conditions, multiple life-threatening diseases often are concentrated in particular populations.",

One such interaction has been found, for example, between type 2 diabetes mellitus and various infections, such as hepatitis C viral infection in women (O\u2019Connor, West, Lorntz, Vinicor, & Jorgensen, 2004). The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing and now impacts the lives of millions of women around the globe. Various factors are recognized as contributing to the onset of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and aging. The role of infection, however, is only beginning to be recognized. Already it is clear that risk for serious infections of various kinds increases significantly with poor diabetes control, but appreciation of more complex relationships between infection and type 2 diabetes is now emerging as well (Soule et al., 2005; Visnegarwala, Chen, Raghavan, & Tedaldi, 2005). The NHANES III study found that type 2 diabetes increases among people who have been infected with the hepatitis C virus. (O\u2019Connor et al., 2004). Similarly, several health reports note that diabetes is present in as many as 37% of those who are critically ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Booth et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 2003). These examples suggest the importance of dynamic diabetes-infection linkages. It is disease interactions of this sort that are a central element in syndemics. Syndemic theory seeks to draw attention to and provide a framework for the analysis of these interactions.",

At the same time, the percentage of new cases among females increased from 18% to 30% between 1990 and 1999, and women were reported with AIDS at a younger age than men (e.g., 20.8% vs. 12.6% in the 13\u201329-year-old age group) (Hartford Community Health Partnership, 2003).

The major goal of this project is to understand strategies and patterns of communication and negotiation surrounding condom and other barrier contraceptive use in these sexually active at-risk populations. The study weaves together a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus group discussions, systematic cultural assessment techniques (Bernard, 2001), in-depth individual sexual and romantic life history interviews, sexual behavior diaries, scenario drama discussions, and structured interviews staged over 4 years of data collection (2004\u20132008).

These purely sexual relationships can be short-term, never proceeding to a romantic stage by definition (e.g., \u201cho,\u201d \u201cone night stand\u201d).

In fact, less than 5% of participants had ever been in a serious relationship in which neither they nor their partner had side partners. The majority (72%), both males (69%) and females (76%), had a secondary partner during one or more of their serious relationships, or had a serious partner who they thought had cheated on them (males 79%, females 86%). In addition, many said that they were already talking to someone else before ending a serious relationship, serving as a catalyst for ending a current relationship when the partner finds out or as a motivating factor to move on once the current relationship grows stale or becomes otherwise unappealing (e.g., controlling behavior by the partner, violence, interference from the baby mama/daddy)\u2014in either case, hedging bets against being alone.Participant: Um, when I was with Carlos, me and Carlos broke up when we were up here, so we broke up for like a couple of weeks or whatever, because, you know he just keeps, he kept playing me [seeing other women] \u2026 we always would break up and get back together and stuff like that and while we were broken up I was messing with Jamal.

Study participants have learned to be cautious about commitment in romantic relationships and tend to hedge their bets by having multiple partners and various kinds of relationships. Moreover, four contextual factors appear to be critical in limiting condom use: (1) condoms are not always available when passions run high; lack of a condom is often not a barrier to having sex; (2) the decision to use a condom flows from a culturally informed assessment of a partner's presumed level of risk rather than from a public health understanding of risky behaviors; (3) emotional involvement in relationships runs counter to continued condom use; the decision to curtail condom use is made quickly; and (4) relationships in which condoms are not used are multiple, overlapping and sequential. The result is a high level of risk for STD. This risk is not random or meaningless; it is conditioned by socioeconomic factors that press participants to focus on short-term pleasure and emotional and material gains rather than on long-term planning and monogamous partnerships. It is, in short, a rational response to social disparity. The results of our investigation, however, lead us towards pessimistic conclusions regarding STD prevention and risk reduction behaviors with current methods. While existing prevention efforts have succeeded in teaching participants about condoms, the context of their utilization creates multiple opportunities for sexual disease transmission.",

These conditions, and the beliefs and behaviors they give rise to in turn, help drive the spread of multiple and potentially interacting STDs, a phenomenon that is termed here the STDS. The STDS in Hartford is reflected in the comparatively high rates of HIV and other STD infections in the low-income, inner city ethnic minority neighborhoods from which study participants were recruited and the comparatively high rates of STD diagnoses reported by study participants. As this discussion suggests, the analysis of syndemic spread must take into account cultural and behavioral patterns in the social context. While syndemics reflect social conditions and unequal social relationships, their diffusion is mediated by the beliefs and behaviors of involved communities, and these, in turn, reflect human responses to the life experiences of injustice and social suffering.",
