These cells were then cultured in MEM containing various concentrations of fetal bovine serum at indicated time period. Next, we compared the viable cell number and cell proliferation rate of p17-expressing cells with those of vector transfected cells. Trypan blue day exclusion assay revealed that the viable cell number was reduced in p17-expressing cells as compared with vector transfected cells. The significant difference was observed at 24 and 48 h incubation. The interesting aspect is that the p17-mediated effect was more clear when cells were cultured in lower serum (1% and 0.1%) condition (Fig. 2\nA). The doubling time of each experiment was calculated and is shown (Fig. 2A). The p17 expression increased the doubling time significantly as compared with vector transfected cells. By using an alternative MTT assay to evaluate the cell proliferation rate, the same growth inhibition pattern of p17 was observed (Fig. 2B, upper). To further confirm that this growth inhibition activity of p17 was specific, we transfected sigma C-pcDNA3.1(\u2212) plasmid into cells. The sigma C expression was demonstrated in our previous study [23]. The presence of sigma C did not alter the cell proliferation rate (Fig. 2B, lower).

The cell death was evaluated by the quantification of plasma membrane damage by measuring the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The principle of LDH activity determination was a two-step reaction. In the first step, NAD+ is reduced to NADH/H+ by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step, the catalyst (diaphorase) transfer H/H+ from NADH/H+ to the tetrazolium salt INT (2-[4-iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride) which is reduced to formazan. The increase of LDH activity in the cell culture supernatant directly correlates to the amount of formazan formed during a limited time period [26]. As shown in Fig. 3\nA, for a 24 and 48 h observation, Vero cells without or with various amounts of p17 expression, under 5% serum or 0.1% serum cultured condition, illustrated a comparable LDH activity level. Cells were treated with 2% Triton X-100 as a high control, which provides information about the maximum releasable LDH activity in the cells. Apoptosis is an alternative cell death way without plasma membrane lysis. The DNA fragmentation was a hallmark feature of apoptosis. Vero cells infected with ARV S1133 strains or ectopically expressed ARV sigma C leaded cells undergoing apoptosis [23]. This result indicated that the p17 expression did not cause the DNA ladder phenomena (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5). Apoptosis was also monitored by PI followed by flow cytometric analysis, and no signs of apoptosis were revealed in p17-expressing cells or control cells (data not shown). These experiments were performed in BHK, 293, and HeLa cells, and the same results were obtained (data not shown).",

Increasing expression levels of p17 were monitored by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A, upper). Four CDK inhibitors p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p21cip1/waf1, and p27kip transcripts were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4\nA). The expression of CDK inhibitors was quantified relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene, actin (Fig. 4A). While the p15INK4b, p16INK4a, and p27kip mRNAs were synthesized at similar levels in vector transfected (data not shown) or p17-pcDNA3.1(\u2212) transfected Vero cells. The level of p21cip1/waf1 mRNA was revealed as a dose- and time-dependent elevation, which is consistent with the increasing amounts of p17 (Fig. 1, Fig. 4A). When ARV sigma C was ectopically expressed, the p21cip1/waf1 mRNA was not altered (data not shown). The same outcome was obtained when these experiments were performed in BHK, 293, and HeLa cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis also demonstrated that p17 expressing cells synthesized a greater amount of p21cip1/waf1 than vector transfected cells (Fig. 4B). The induction pattern of p21cip1/waf1 mRNA and p21cip1/waf1 protein was consistent.",

Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of endogenous p53 was accumulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in Vero cells expressing p17 (Fig. 5\nA) but not in vector transfected cells (data not shown). Furthermore, it is well known that an activated p53 formed tetramer and exerted a specific DNA binding ability to activate downstream genes. We thus analyzed the luciferase reporter activity, which was controlled by a synthetic promoter containing direct repeats of the transcription recognition sequence for p53, in cells with or without p17 expression. Vero cells were transfected with various amounts of p17 expression plasmids together with p53-luciferase reporter DNA. The luciferase activity was expressed as activation folds. Our results clearly revealed that the p53 specific-DNA binding capacity was increased in the presence of p17 in a dose-dependent pattern (Fig. 5B). The timing of the induction of p53 and p21cip1/waf1 is almost consistent, suggesting that the induction of transcriptionally active p53, in response to p17, activates the expression level of p21cip1/waf1.",

The possible p53-mediated alterations in the viability of the cell were ruled out by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). When Vero cells expressed dominant negative p53, the p17-induced p53-drived luciferase activity was reduced about 5- to 7-fold (Fig. 6\nA), further, the p17-mediated growth retardation phenomenon was significantly released (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, p17-mediated p21cip1/waf1 induction was abolished in the presence of dominant negative p53 (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 6).

To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that ARV p17 is capable of retarding cell growth in cultured transiently transfected cells, a novel biological function of p17. The inhibition of cell growth effect of p17 was more dramatic when cells were cultured in low serum medium. We explained that this result may be due to the complex components (e.g., growth factors, serum protein) of fetal bovine serum, and these factors may modulate cellular signaling and cell cycle check point control.
