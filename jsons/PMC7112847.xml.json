It has a mortality rate exceeding 40% and is caused by an iridovirus which was isolated originally in 1998 (Chen et al., 1999). Electron microscopy showed that this is an enveloped virus with icosahedral symmetry has and a diameter of 120\u2013160 nm. On the basis of histopathological and morphological evidence, the virus is characterized as a member of the Iridoviridae family and is designated as soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) (Chen et al., 1999).",

Phylogenetic analysis based on the major caspid protein (MCP) is considered to be an appropriate method for differentiating different iridovirus strains and species (Bollinger et al., 1999). Multiple alignment and phylogenetic trees of various STIV MCPs (major capsid proteins) show that STIV belongs to the genus Ranavirus (Zhao et al., 2007). The complete sequence of the STIV genome has been described (GenBank accession no. EU627010). The STIV genome is 105,890 bp in length and contains 105 potential open reading frames (ORFs), which encode polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1294 amino acids and 20 microRNA candidates. Comparative genomic analysis shows that STIV has a colinear arrangement of genes similar to that of frog virus 3 (FV3), which is a member of the Ranavirus (Huang et al., 2009).",

Artificial infection showed that the mortality rate of turtles infected with STIV inoculated by injection was greater than 40% (Chen et al., 1999). Only a PCR-based method is available for the detection of STIV (Zhao et al., 2007). However, conventional PCR is neither sufficiently accurate nor sufficiently quantitative for routine diagnosis (Yue et al., 2008). The aim of this study was to develop a double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) method for detection of STIV. Monoclonal antibodies against STIV were produced and used to develop the DAS-ELISA, which may prove to be useful for detecting STIV antigens in clinical samples.",

As CO cell line is not only sensitive with STIV, the results of tissue culture must be identified by other detection methods. PCR detection method is the most common method for the detection of STIV at present. In this study, the correlation rate between DAS-ELISA and PCR was 98.4%. The number of positive samples detected by DAS-ELISA was two more compared to that determined by the tissue culture and PCR method. It is possible that the STIV gene concentration was lower than the sensitivity of tissue culture or PCR, and two false negatives may have been detected. The DAS-ELISA method could also detect antigens of STIV. In other words, it could detect live viruses in samples. In contrast, PCR could only detect gene fragments. These results clearly suggest that the DAS-ELISA has high specificity and sensitivity, and produces more reliable results than PCR.",
