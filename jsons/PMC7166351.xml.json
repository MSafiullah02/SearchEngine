Influenza viruses are the predominant pathogens involved with the presentation of influenza\u2010like\u2010illness with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that 5\u201310% of the world's population are infected with influenza each year, resulting in 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths annually [WHO, 1999]. However, the clinical symptoms of an influenza infection are difficult to distinguish from infections with other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103), adenovirus (HAdV), coronaviruses (HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HCoV\u2010HKU1), metapneumovirus (HMPV), and rhinovirus (HRV). Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish these infections to monitor influenza epidemiology and vaccine efficacy.",

Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of infectious\u2010related deaths in children worldwide. However, the majority of these deaths occur in children in developing countries [Williams et al., 2002]. The differing etiologies of respiratory illnesses in young children and adults is poorly understood, although it is well known that some viruses such as HRSV are much more likely to cause severe disease in children <5 years [Ogra, 2004]. In Papua New Guinea acute respiratory infections have a high burden, with pneumonia being the most common cause of hospitalization and death in children <5 years of age [National Health Plan, 2010]. The high carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae in this population [Francis et al., 2009] and the absence of vaccination against seasonal influenza or S. pneumoniae undoubtedly contribute to the high morbidity and mortality due to acute respiratory infections.",

However, this figure is comparable to the detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with influenza\u2010like\u2010illness in studies from China [Huo et al., 2012] and Madagascar [Razanajatavo et al., 2011]. These differences may be attributed to the lower socio\u2010economic status of people in these countries, or environmental and other more complex factors. All of the viruses which were targeted in this study were detected in at least two patients.

The detection of HRV in 17% of samples may be an underestimate as more than 100 serotypes exist [Kennedy et al., 2012] and a single primer set may not be sufficient to amplify all of the existing variations. However, the frequent detection of this virus in the respiratory tracts of healthy people make it difficult to determine the etiological role it plays in influenza\u2010like\u2010illness and lower respiratory tract infections as many studies that have compared the detection rate of HRV between patients with influenza\u2010like\u2010illness and healthy controls have not found a significant difference between the two groups [Buecher et al., 2010; Chidlow et al., 2012].

Seasonal influenza vaccination is very rare in Papua New Guinea, so this is unlikely to have any bearing on the detection rate of these viruses in this population. Outbreaks of influenza have had a major impact on Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations in the past. The isolation of many communities and the contribution of poverty, high bacterial carriage and poor access to health services have led to significant mortalities in indigenous populations [Kelso and Reading, 2010]. The samples analyzed in this study were collected closely following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. All of the influenza A strains that were further subtyped (n = 25) were confirmed as A/H1N1pdm09 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza Surveillance and Research, Melbourne Australia (data not shown). The majority of the PNG population most likely had very low immunity to this virus and therefore the rates of influenza A may have been higher during this period than at other times.",

In particular, HRSV is accepted as the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract disease in young children [Leung et al., 2005]. Nair et al. [2010] estimated that HRSV caused 66,000\u2013199,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age in 2005, and 99% of these deaths were in developing countries. HAdV can be associated with respiratory illnesses throughout all age groups, but most commonly in young infants or school aged children. By age 5 almost 75% of children have serological evidence of adenovirus infection [Langley, 2005]. The detection of influenza B at significantly higher rates in young children has not been reported extensively [Peltola et al., 2003]. Previous studies have suggested that influenza B may cause less severe illness in adults due to partial immunity elicited to previously circulating strains of influenza B virus [Glezen et al., 1980; Newland et al., 2006].",
