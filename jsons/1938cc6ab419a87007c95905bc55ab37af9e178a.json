Texts of interest include abstracts of clinical trials in English and in multilingual contexts. The main focus is on information characterized via the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) framework, but data extraction is not limited to these fields. Recent neural network architectures based on transformers show capacities for transfer learning and increased performance on downstream natural language processing tasks such as universal reading comprehension, brought forward by this architecture's use of contextualized word embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. This paper contributes to solving problems related to ambiguity in PICO sentence prediction tasks, as well as highlighting how annotations for training named entity recognition systems are used to train a high-performing, but nevertheless flexible architecture for question answering in systematic review automation. Additionally, it demonstrates how the problem of insufficient amounts of training annotations for PICO entity extraction is tackled by augmentation. All models in this paper were created with the aim to support systematic review (semi)automation. They achieve high F1 scores, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying transformer-based classification methods to support data mining in the biomedical literature.",

Such systems need to be able to classify and extract data of interest. We show that transformer models perform well on complex dataextraction tasks.

This architecture's key strengths are rooted in both feature representation and training. A good feature representation is essential to ensure any model's performance, but often data sparsity in the unsupervised training of embedding mechanisms leads to losses in overall performance. By employing a word piece vocabulary, BERT eliminated the problem of previously unseen words. Any word that is not present in the initial vocabulary is split into a sub-word vocabulary. Especially in the biomedical domain this enables richer semantic representations of words describing rare chemical compounds or conditions. A relevant example is the phrase 'two drops of ketorolac tromethamine', where the initial three words stay intact, while the last words are tokenized to 'ket', '#oro', '#lac', 'tro', '#meth', '#amine', hence enabling the following model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, such as syllables that indicate chemical compounds. When obtaining a numerical representation for its inputs, transformers apply a 'self-attention' mechanism, which leads to a contextualized representation of each word with respect to its surrounding words.",

LSTM architectures commonly employ a trimmed version of Word2Vec embeddings as embedding layer. In our case, this leads to 20% of the input data being represented by generic 'Unknown' tokens. These words are missing because they occur so rarely that no embedding vector was trained for them. Trimming means that the available embedding vocabulary is then further reduced to the known words of the training, development and testing data, in order to save memory and increase speed. The percentage of unknown tokens is likely to increase when predicting on previously unseen and unlabelled data. We tested our locally trained LSTM on 5000 abstracts from a study-based register and found that 36% of all unique input features did not have a known representation.",

As we show later, the automated annotation technique causes noise in the evaluation because as the network learns, it can assign correct tags to wrongly labelled data. We also show that sentence labels are often ambiguous, and that the assignment of a single label limits the quality of the predictions for their use in real-world reviewing tasks.",

This resulted in each sentence being represented by a fixed length vector of 768 dimensions in each layer respectively, as defined by the model architecture's hidden size. These vectors can be obtained for each of the network's layers, and multiple layers can be represented together by concatenation and pooling. 2 We used the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to reduce each layer-embedding into two-dimensional space, and plotted the resulting values. Additionally, we computed adjusted rand scores in order to evaluate how well each layer (or concatenation thereof, always using reduce mean pooling) represents our input sequence.

We created sets of general, differently phrased P, I, and O questions for the purpose of training a broad representation of each PICO element question. In this section we describe the process of adapting the ebm-nlp data to the second version of the SQuAD format, and then augmenting the training data with some of the original SQuAD data. Figure 1 shows an example of the converted data, together with a highlevel software architecture description for our QA-BERT model. We created a conversion script to automate this task. To reduce context length, it first split each ebm-nlp abstract into sentences. For each P, I, and O class it checked the presence of annotated entity spans in the ebm-nlp source files. Then, a question was randomly drawn from our set of general questions for this class, to complete a context and a span-answer pair in forming a new SQuAD-like question element. In cases where a sentence did not contain a span, a question was still chosen, but the answer was marked as impossible, with the plausible answer span set to begin at character 0. In the absence of impossible answers, the model would always return some part of the context as answer, and hence be of no use for rarer entities such as P, which only occurs in only 30% of all context sentences.",

This classification works by adding a spanclassification head on top of a pre-trained transformer model. The span-classification mechanism learns to predict the most probable start and end positions of potential answers within a given context (Wolf et al., 2019) . The Transformers library offers classes for tokenizers, BERT and other transformer models and provides methods for feature representation and optimization. We used BertForQuestionAnswering. Training was carried out on Google's Colab, using the GPU runtime option. We used a batch size of 18 per GPU and a learning rate of 3 \u22125 . Training lasted for 2 epochs, context length was limited to 150. To reduce the time needed to train, we only used BERTbase (uncased) weights as starting points, and used a maximum of 200 out of the 442 SQuAD domains. To date, the Transformers library includes several BERT, XLM, XLNet, DistilBERT and ALBERT question answering models that can be fine-tuned with the scripts and data that we describe in this paper. Figure 2 shows the dimensionality-reduced vectors for 3000 sentences in BERT-base, along with the positions of three exemplary sentences. All three examples were labelled as 'P' in the gold standard. This visualization highlights overlaps between the sentence data and ambiguity or noise in the labels. Sentences 1 and 2 are labelled incorrectly, and clearly appear far away from the population class centroid. Sentence 3 is an example of an ambiguous case. It appears very close to the population centroid, but neither its label nor its position reflect the intervention content. This supports a need for multiple tags per sentence, and the fine-tuning of weights within the network. Figure 3 shows the same set of sentences, represented by concatenations of SCIBERT outputs. SCIBERT was chosen as an additional baseline model for fine-tuning because it provided the best representation of embedded PICO sentences. When clustered, its embeddings yielded an adjusted rand score of 0.57 for a concatenation of the two layers, compared with 0.25 for BERT-base.",

Here, recall and precision scores in ranges between 0.92 and 0.97 are possible with F1 scores not dropping below 0.84 for the main classes of interest.

Table 3 shows examples of two abstracts, as predicted by the model. Additionally, this table demonstrates how a sentence prediction model can be used to highlight text. With the current infrastructure it is possible to highlight PICOs selectively, to highlight all classes simultaneously, and to adjust thresholds for class assignment in order to increase or decrease the amount of highlighted sentences.

We never used the full SQuAD data in order to reduce time for training but observed increased performance when adding additional data. For classifying I entities, an increase from 20 to 200 additional SQuAD domains resulted in an increase of 8% for the F1 score, whereas the increase for the O domain was less than 1%.

This indicates that the addition of impossible answer elements was successful, and that the model learned a representation of how to discriminate PICO contexts. The scores for correctly predicting PICOs in positive scenarios are lower. These results are presented in Table 5 . Here, two factors could influence this score in a negative way. First, labelled spans can be noisy. Training spans were annotated by crowd workers and the authors of the original dataset noted inter-annotator disagreement. Often, these spans include full stops, other punctuation or different levels of detail describing a PICO. The F1 score decreases if the model predicts a PICO, but the predicted span includes marginal differences that were not marked up by the experts who annotated the testing set. Second, some spans include multiple PICOs, sometimes across sentence boundaries. Other spans mark up single PICOS in succession. In these cases the model might find multiple PICOs in a row, and annotate them as one or vice versa. ",
