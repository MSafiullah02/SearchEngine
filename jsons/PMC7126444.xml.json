Plant viruses are of special interest as carriers of immunogenic peptides and for use as potential vaccines, in part because they are not infectious in humans and other animals. Compared to most animal viruses, the structure of most plant viruses is very simple, and are often formed with a single coat protein (CP) type. Most plant viruses are not enveloped, and many accumulate to very high levels in their host. For these reasons, viruses such as tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV), cowpea mosaic comovirus (CPMV) and johnsongrass mosaic potyvirus (JGMV) have been investigated for their potential use as epitope presenters with different degrees of success Haynes et al 1986, Hamamoto et al 1993, Usha et al 1993, Jagadish et al 1993, Fitchen et al 1995, Sugiyama et al 1995, Turpen et al 1995, Beachy et al 1996, Lomonossoff and Johnson 1996.",

We investigated whether or not the PR2 genes are activated in BY2 protoplasts and in N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and Xanthi-NN plants following infection by w.t. TMV or TMV mutants. RNA dot blot analyses were performed using total RNA purified from protoplasts (at 24 and 36 h.p.i.), Xanthi-nn (4 d.p.i.), and Xanthi-NN (4 d.p.i.) plants inoculated with TMV-RB19, TMV-RB19E or w.t. TMV-U1.32P-labeled DNA molecules specific to acidic or to basic PR2 gene were used as probes. There was little or no induction of acidic or basic PR2 mRNA in BY2 protoplasts infected with w.t. TMV or with hybrid viruses (data not shown). In contrast, TMV-RB19 induced accumulation of acidic and basic PR2 gene expression in inoculated leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and Xanthi-NN (Figure 6). In Xanthi-NN plants inoculated with TMV-RB19, basic PR2 gene expression was about two times greater than that on TMV inoculated Xanthi-NN plants, whereas the accumulation of acidic PR2 mRNA was about the same in both plants (Figure 6). On inoculated leaves (IL) of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn plants, high levels of mRNAs of acidic and basic PR2 gene expression was observed after inoculation with TMV-RB19, but not by w.t. TMV or TMV-RB19E (Figure 6 and data not shown). Basic PR2 gene expression was induced in inoculated leaves, but not in non-inoculated upper leaves (SL; Figure 6(a)). However, basic PR2 mRNA levels in Xanthi-nn inoculated with TMV-RB19 was about 20 times higher than in Xanthi-nn leaves inoculated with w.t. TMV, and about three to five times higher than in Xanthi-NN leaves inoculated with TMV or TMV-RB19 (Figure 6(a)). In contrast, the accumulation of acidic PR2 mRNA in Xanthi-nn inoculated with TMV-RB19 was similar to that observed on Xanthi-NN inoculated with TMV or TMV-RB19 (Figure 6(b)).

TMV CP is a good carrier because it self-assembles in an ordered manner, and accumulates to large amounts in infected tissues. Furthermore, as the atomic structure of TMV is known, one can design proteins that display foreign peptides on the surface of the virion. CP molecules have presumably evolved a variety of functions (e.g. efficient assembly), and in some cases, play an important role in virus movement and/or replication (Matthews, 1991). Mutations in viral CP can cause loss of certain CP functions (Bendahmane et al., 1997). Similarly, display of peptides on the surface of TMV as fusion to the CP can reduce local and systemic virion accumulation in infected plants, and can induce the expression of host defense genes (Beachy et al., 1996; this study).",

The 23 amino acid residues of peptide G5-24 from the RV glycoprotein, and the ten amino acid residue peptide containing the 5B19 epitope from MHV spike protein, were successfully exposed on the surface of TMV. The respective viruses, TMV-G5.24 and TMV-5B19, systemically infected N. tabacum Xanthi-nn. However, insertion of the peptide 31D from the RV nucleoprotein in TMV CP (TMV-31D) reduced the infectivity of the hybrid virus TMV-31D in plants. In BY2 protoplasts TMV-31D replicated and CP-31D accumulated to high levels (Figure 3(b)). The results indicate that the lack of virus accumulation in infected plant leaves may result from interference with local movement. This important finding remains unexplained, since it has been shown that local cell to cell spread of TMV does not require CP. A possible explanation for these results is that leaf cells that are infected are killed before local spread can occur.",

CP (e.g. G5-24, 5B19, and 5B19L; Figure 1(a); Table 1), were successfully displayed on TMV particles, and the chimeric viruses caused systemic infections.

Altering the pI:charge value in hybrid CP to bring it near to that of w.t. CP, 5.31:\u22122 (by inserting Asp to Glu residues before or after the peptide) eliminated the necrotic reaction and resulted in local and systemic infection (Table 1). These results confirmed the importance of pI:charge value of the hybrid protein, and show that highly positively charged peptides can influence the interaction of TMV with the host. In contrast, negatively charged epitopes are more tolerated than are positively charged epitopes (e.g. G5-24 and 5B19L peptides; Table 1).

Although N. tabacum Xanthi-nn lacks the N gene, the hybrid virus TMV-RB19 induced HR on these plants. The mechanism of induction of HR by TMV-RB19 on Xanthi-nn plants is not known. However, the signal transduction pathway that results in HR on Xanthi-NN and Xanthi-nn may, at least in a part, be different. This is supported by the observation that TMV-RB19 induces cell death in infected BY2 protoplasts whereas w.t. TMV does not. Furthermore, protoplasts derived from Xanthi-NN plants do not die when infected with TMV (Otsuki et al., 1972). It is known that infection by TMV induces the expression of the basic PR2 gene in the inoculated leaves and the expression of the acidic PR2 gene both locally and systemically in Xanthi-NN Brederode et al 1991, Heitz et al 1994, but not in Xanthi-nn plants that lack the N gene (Linthorst, 1991). In contrast to Xanthi-nn plants inoculated with w.t. TMV, Xanthi-nn plants that produce necrotic lesions following inoculation with TMV-RB19 resulted in the expression of the basic and the acidic PR2 genes. These results indicate that the HR observed in the Xanthi-nn plants inoculated with TMV-RB19 may share a portion of the HR signal transduction pathway with the HR in Xanthi-NN.",

An answer may reside in the fact that TMV-RB19 and TMV-5B19 assemble to form virus particles which are very insoluble in plant cells. Indeed, electron microscopy experiments showed that virus particles were recovered from membrane-rich fractions rather than from a soluble supernatant fraction. This may indicate that insertion of the RB19 or 5B19 peptides at the C terminus of TMV CP creates a domain on the surface of assembled viruses that interacts with and destabilizes cellular membranes, thus causing BY2 cell death. Porta et al. (1994) studied the expression of an epitope from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) on the surface of CPMV and found an unusual affinity of the hybrid CPMV-FMDV with cellular membranes. Porta et al. (1994) proposed a direct involvement of three amino acid residues (Arg-Gly-Asp) of the FMDV epitope in affinity with the membrane. The predicted hydrophobicity of the CP-5B19 and CP-RB19 compared to w.t. CP suggests that both proteins may create hydrophobic domains at the C terminus of the hybrid CP that is not present in w.t. CP. This domain may interact with and anchor the CP and/or the virus with cell membranes.",
