            "text": "The respiratory tract is continually exposed to a range of microorganisms that normal immune responses generally prevent from causing infection. Hence, it is not surprising that patients with significantly impaired immunity frequently develop lung infections. Immunodeficient patients also frequently have several other risk factors that contribute to an increased risk for development of pneumonia, including low-level microaspiration of oropharyngeal contents, mucosal damage caused by cytotoxic therapy, underlying lung damage, and poor nutrition. As a consequence, lung infections are a common and frequently serious complication in patients with significant impairment of the immune system. Pulmonary infiltrates occur in 25% of patients with neutropenia developing after chemotherapy, and up to 5% of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) will die as a result of pneumonia. The range of potential pathogens causing lung infections in immunocompromised patients is much broader than for the usual pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia and includes organisms such as Aspergillus fumigatus and human cytomegalovirus (CMV); the diagnosis of infections due to these microbes can be difficult, and the required therapies frequently are toxic. The large number of potential pathogens and the background disease together make management of lung infection in immunocompromised patients considerably more complex, and the use of invasive diagnostic tests such as bronchoscopy frequently is necessary. This chapter focuses on the common causative pathogens and the clinical approach to pulmonary infections in patients who have been severely immunocompromised by chemotherapy, organ transplantation, or hematologic disease (Box 28-1\n) but not human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (discussed in Chapter 29). Pneumonia in patients with milder degrees of immunosuppression due to myeloma, low-dose cytotoxic therapy, or disease-modifying agents administered for rheumatologic conditions generally should be managed as community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia, but with recognition that the disease could be due to various opportunistic pathogens, as discussed in this chapter.Box 28-1Diseases and Conditions Associated With Severe Immunocompromise*\nLymphoma/leukemiaHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)Aplastic anemiaSolid organ transplantationOther causes of neutropenia (fewer than 1500 cells/mL)Inherited disorders of immune function (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease, recent chemotherapy)High-dose corticosteroid treatment (greater than 30 mg prednisolone for 21 days or longer)Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine)Treatment with cytotoxic therapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate)\n",

The three main categories of immune defect are absolute or functional neutropenia, defects in cell-mediated immunity, and deficiencies in antibody responses (a clinically less severely affected category). Each is associated with a particular range of pathogens (see Table 28-2). Patients with neutropenia are mainly at risk for infection with extracellular pathogens such as pyogenic bacteria and filamentous fungi. Defects in cell-mediated immunity tend to predispose affected patients to development of infections with intracellular pathogens such as viruses and mycobacteria, as well as some unusual extracellular infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Deficiencies in antibody responses result in a high incidence of infections due to encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and to herpesviruses. Individual patients may have a combination of these immune defects; for example, lymphoma can cause impairment of cell-mediated immunity that can be combined with neutropenia if the patient receives chemotherapy.",

The immune defects associated with HSCT depend on the conditioning regimen and type of graft, and evolve with time. In phase I, the preengraftment phase (15 to 45 days after transplantation), prolonged neutropenia and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier increase the risk of bacterial and fungal infections. Herpes simplex virus reactivation also can occur during this phase. In phase II, the immediate post-engraftment phase at around 30 to 100 days after transplantation, infections relate primarily to impaired cell-mediated immunity and include those due to herpesviruses (particularly CMV) and PCP unless the patient is given prophylaxis. During phase III, the late phase (beyond 100 days), common pathogens again include herpesviruses, but there is also a marked increased incidence of infection with encapsulated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, perhaps relating to impaired humoral immunity. Graft-versus-host disease also is associated with ongoing susceptibility to Aspergillus during phases II and III. For recipients of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplants, substantial differences may be observed during phase I, but susceptibility to infections during phases II and III is about the same. The risk of disease from community-acquired respiratory viruses is elevated in all three phases.",

            "text": "By combining the clinical pattern of presentation with knowledge of the patient's immune defect, a differential diagnosis of likely pathogens can be suggested. For example, infections developing rapidly over 1 to 3 days with a marked rise in serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), pronounced fever, and focal radiologic changes are very likely to be due to infection with pyogenic bacteria. In a patient with a defect in cell-mediated immunity, however, widespread ground glass infiltrations in both lungs developing over several days could represent CMV pneumonitis or PCP. In general, the more severe and prolonged the immune defect, the greater the range of possible causative pathogens and the less typical the clinical presentation for a particular pathogen, prompting the need for early invasive investigation if the initial therapy is failing to effect improvement. Furthermore the character of the disease can be dictated by the severity of the immune defect. For example, infections due to filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus progress faster with increasing severity of neutropenia, but may regress and become more focal when the neutrophil count recovers. Table 28-3\nshows the common conditions that should be considered for different presentations of lung complications in immunocompromised patients. Many patients will be found to have dual pathologic processes, either involving two separate pathogens or with simultaneous noninfective (fluid overload being the most common) and infective problems, which will be responsible for separate elements of the clinical picture.",

For instance, infected indwelling vascular and urinary catheters can form foci of infection that can metastasize to the lungs, and previous Aspergillus infection may recur during new episodes of immunosuppression. Knowledge of previous and present CMV status identifies patients at risk for development of CMV pneumonitis, and positive sputum surveillance cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa may indicate likely causes of a new pneumonia. In addition, positive samples from other patients also may be helpful, because local epidemics of respiratory virus infections are not uncommon in hospitals, and more rarely, clusters of nosocomial Aspergillus, Nocardia (both of which may be associated with ongoing construction on the hospital site), or Legionella infection can occur.",

Patients with certain ethnic backgrounds or a pertinent travel history are more at risk of TB, endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis, or parasitic diseases such as disseminated strongyloidiasis. Finally, the patient's background lung structure and function should be considered, because existing structural abnormalities may make certain pathogens more likely. For example, bronchiectasis could predispose affected persons to pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa (Figure 28-1\n), and preexisting lung cavities to Aspergillus infection.",

The most likely reason for a lack of improvement in the patient's condition within 48 to 96 hours is infection with bacteria resistant to first-line antibiotics. At this point, treatment with second-line antibiotics effective against likely resistant organisms should be started. Consideration also should be given to starting antibiotics that are effective against MRSA and anaerobic pathogens if this has not been done already. In patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection, especially those with CT evidence of associated nodular disease or patchy or infarct-shaped consolidation, failure of first-line therapy warrants testing for fungal antigens (galactomannan or \u03b2-d-glucan) and either fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with BAL or percutaneous CT-guided biopsy (mainly for evaluation of dense consolidation adjacent to the pleura). These investigations also will be necessary in patients whose pneumonia fails to respond to second-line antibiotic therapy or those with subacute or chronic consolidation in whom sputum microbiologic or cytologic testing is nondiagnostic. With progressive disease and lack of a definitive diagnosis after the foregoing tests, surgical biopsy should be seriously considered.",

As a consequence, unless nasopharyngeal aspirate studies identify a respiratory viral infection, early FOB with BAL and, if possible, transbronchial biopsy should be attempted. Often, however, these patients are markedly hypoxic, increasing the risk associated with the procedure. Negative results on FOB do not exclude infective causes, and a decision then needs to be taken about empirical treatment versus VATS lung biopsy.

Aspergillus and Nocardia tend to cause a small number of nodules, whereas mycobacteria also can cause large numbers of small nodules. In addition, blood-borne spread of bacteria or Candida from infected indwelling devices can cause a variable number (often numerous) of pulmonary nodules. Serum testing for fungal antigens (galactomannan or \u03b2-d-glucan) should be performed. Nodules caused by pyogenic bacterial and viral pneumonia tend to be associated with other radiographic changes findings such as ground glass infiltrates or consolidation. The other major causes of nodules are underlying malignant disease and lymphoproliferative disorders secondary to prolonged immunosuppression. In the absence of CT signs suggestive of invasive filamentous fungal infection (the halo and crescent signs), nodules in patients with line infections or a positive blood culture may be treated empirically as for metastatic infection. For a majority of other patients with lung nodules, FOB with BAL is necessary, although for patients at high risk for infection with invasive filamentous fungi, if CT changes suggestive of Aspergillus infection are present, then empirical antifungal therapy is a reasonable alternative strategy, especially if the result of fungal antigen testing is positive. If FOB findings are unhelpful, the patient should progress to percutaneous CT-guided or VATS lung biopsy, because infections due to fungi, Nocardia, or mycobacteria are accompanied by specific histopathologic changes, and biopsy frequently is diagnostic.",

In our own experience, peroral FOB can be performed without significant bleeding in patients with a platelet count of 10,000/mL. BAL should be performed in patients with marked hypoxia or severe tachypnea only after careful consideration of risk versus benefit, because the procedure commonly reduces Pao\n2 by 20 mm Hg and may precipitate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The chest radiograph may be normal in appearance or show nonspecific diffuse bilateral infiltrates. CT scan is more sensitive at identifying pulmonary infiltrates and classically shows bibasal symmetric ground glass opacities, septal line thickening, and multiple small centrilobular nodules (Figure 28-9\n). More asymmetric changes, consolidation, and effusions are not uncommon, however. The main considerations in the differential diagnosis are IPS, drug-induced pneumonitis, and, in patients not receiving effective prophylaxis, PCP. Serologic determination of either IgG or IgM has no place in the diagnosis of CMV disease, because these antibodies merely reflect previous exposure. However, CMV reactivation is nowadays readily detected by identifying significant viremia through either measuring the level of pp65 antigenemia or CMV DNA using PCR assay in the blood. CMV viremia usually is detectable 2 to 5 days before any clinical manifestations. Unfortunately, CMV viremia is not always present in patients with CMV pneumonitis; conversely, evidence of reactivation does not necessarily mean that new lung infiltrates are due to CMV pneumonitis. The chance that CMV infection is responsible for new lung infiltrates is proportional in part to the level of CMV in the blood, especially if the viral load increased rapidly. Definitive confirmation that CMV is causing pneumonia requires identification of CMV in the respiratory tract by FOB for BAL and preferably a transbronchial biopsy, or possibly a VATS lung biopsy. The presence of \u201cowl's eye\u201d intranuclear inclusions on cytologic examination is pathognomonic for CMV infection and although this modality is rapid, it is a relatively insensitive test. CMV can be cultured from respiratory samples using fibroblast cell culture to look for the distinctive cytopathogenic effect, but this takes at least a week and therefore is of little clinical benefit. The main diagnostic techniques for CMV pneumonitis are the relatively sensitive rapid tests for CMV antigens using BAL samples directly, or indirectly by probing cell cultures inoculated with the samples after 24 to 48 hours incubation (the shell vial or early antigen detection assays). Quantitative PCR assay on BAL fluid has been used to improve the predictive value for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis but requires further investigation.

Ganciclovir has significant marrow-depressant effects and may be too toxic for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients or in patients with existing pancytopenia. Oral absorption is poor, but oral therapy with the valine ester valganciclovir has excellent bioavailability. The second-line agent foscarnet also inhibits the activity of viral DNA polymerase (by binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site). Foscarnet frequently causes significant renal toxicity. Alternatively, cidofovir has a broad activity against DNA viruses including CMV, acting as a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerases. Cidofovir causes both myelosuppression and renal toxicity, and patients should be prehydrated and given probeniced before initiation of treatment. Patients with CMV disease also are frequently given hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as passive vaccination therapy. Very few studies have compared these drugs for efficacy in CMV pneumonia. Treatment lasts from 14 to 21 days and should be guided by blood tests measuring the level of CMV viremia. Patients at risk for such infection often are given antiviral prophylaxis such as with valganciclovir. The mortality rate for established CMV pneumonia is up to 50% in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients but is less in other types of immunocompromised patients.

On chest radiographs, CNPA manifests as an indolent patch of consolidation with or without cavitation that progresses over weeks or months (Figure 28-13\n), whereas CCPA manifests with an expanding upper lobe dry cavity with a thickened and irregular wall.

In high-risk patients with a compatible clinical syndrome and CT findings highly suggestive of IPA (halo and crescent signs), the diagnosis can be made clinically and may not require confirmation by invasive investigations. However, some Aspergillus species (e.g., A. terreus) are resistant to amphotericin B, and a clinical presentation similar to that in IPA can be caused by rarer filamentous fungi with drug sensitivities that differ from those demonstrated for Aspergillus. Hence, microbiologic confirmation is reassuring, because it ensures that appropriate treatment is given. A microbiologic diagnosis of IPA can be made by culture, cytologic, or histologic appearances in BAL or lung biopsy specimens, or by the detection of fungal cell wall antigen (galactomannan or \u03b2-d-glucan) or DNA (by PCR assay) in blood or BAL fluid. Isolation of Aspergillus from BAL in a high-risk immunodeficient patient is highly predictive of IPA but is relatively insensitive, identifying only 50% of cases of IPA. Culture from sputum is even less sensitive, and blood cultures are only rarely positive. Percutaneous CT-guided or VATS biopsy is highly sensitive, because histopathologic examination of the sample can readily identify fungal hyphae infiltrating through lung tissue if fungal stains are used. Hence, strong consideration should be given to biopsy of lung nodules not responding to conventional antibacterial antibiotics, especially if BAL was nondiagnostic. To decrease mortality by allowing rapid identification of cases of IPA before the fungal load is high, several noninvasive tests have been developed. These include detection of galactomannan or \u03b2-d-glucan cell wall antigen in the blood (or BAL fluid if FOB has been performed), or PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA from the blood or BAL fluid. These tests are highly sensitive and when used as surveillance in high-risk patients could lead to preemptive antifungal therapy before clinically apparent disease has developed, leading to an improved mortality. However, detection of fungal DNA in a single sample of peripheral blood is a poor indicator of early invasive fungal infection, and galactomannan antigen is not specific for Aspergillus spp., frequently giving false-positive results (especially in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or in young children). Despite these caveats, a negative galactomannan assay result makes active IPA infection unlikely. Serologic tests for antibodies to Aspergillus usually yield negative results in immunocompromised patients with IPA.",

Doses, modes of action, and common toxicities for the different treatment options are given in Table 28-6\n. Voriconazole may be more effective than amphotericin B for treating IPA, but which drug is used depends on the patient's tolerance for that agent and any preexisting medical conditions (e.g., amphotericin B should be avoided in patients with renal problems, and azoles in patients with liver disease). Itraconazole is less efficacious and should be reserved for oral treatment in patients recovering from IPA after induction treatment with amphotericin B, caspofungin, or voriconazole or for the long-term treatment required for chronic forms of invasive aspergillosis. Drug levels probably should be monitored for patients receiving itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, at least for patients on prolonged therapy. The role of combination therapy remains unclear, but this strategy is potentially attractive in view of different mechanisms of action for the three effective classes of drugs. Urgent surgical resection should be considered in patients with major hemoptysis, because fatal bleeding is not uncommon. Elective resection can be used as primary therapy for single lesions due to IPA, especially those containing an intracavitary mycetoma that might lead to reactivation of IPA during subsequent immunosuppression. Treatment of IPA for several weeks often is necessary, followed by prophylactic therapy in cases with persisting radiologic changes. Treatment of CNPA and CCPA will need to be continued for months if not years (and even lifelong). Owing to a combination of uncontrolled infection and the underlying disease, the mortality rate for IPA is around 50%, and with chronic forms of aspergillosis, the infection rate remains as high as 33%. Azoles can be used for prophylaxis in at-risk groups, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Fluconazole is not effective at preventing mold infections such as IPA, and despite its efficacy against Aspergillus, voriconazole seems to offer no clinical benefit over prophylaxis with fluconazole. However, prophylaxis with the newer extended-spectrum triazole posaconazole reduced the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with prolonged neutropenia, from 7% to 1%. Acquired resistance of A. fumigatus to posaconazole has emerged during the course of therapy, which may potentially limit its use for prophylaxis.",
