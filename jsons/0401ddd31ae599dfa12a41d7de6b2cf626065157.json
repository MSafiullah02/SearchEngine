            "text": "The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.",

More specifically, the bilateral and peripheral ground-class and consolidative pulmonary opacities in CT are the typical features of COVID-19 symptoms, and the greater severity of the disease with increasing time from onset symptoms shows larger lung involvement and more linear opacities, a.k.a. the \"crazy-paving\" pattern and the \"reverse halo\" sign Bernheim et al., 2020) .",

However, there are still two major challenges: 1) Noisy data, due to the large variations of data collected in an emergent situation, such as using different reconstruction kernels and CT manufactures, along with possible patient movements; 2) Confusing cases, due to similar radiological appearance of COVID-19 and other pneumonia, especially in the early stage.

The most essential task is to exploit the latent relationship among various COVID-19 cases and CAP cases, and then make a prediction for a new testing case, i.e., whether belonging to COVID-19 or not. The proposed framework employs a vertex-weighted hypergraph structure to formulate data correlation among different cases. The module of \"uncertainty score measurement\" is used to generate two metrics, i.e., 1) noisy data aleatoric uncertainty and 2) the models inability epistemic uncertainty. Then, the proposed UVHL conducts learning on the hypergraph structure to make a prediction for the new testing case, by simultaneously a) incorporating the uncertainty values of measured data to relieve the misleading patterns from noisy low-quality data and b) allocating more attention to the nodes distributing around the classifying interface in the latent representation space. Another ad- vantage of the proposed framework is its flexibility in utilizing multi-modal data/features when available. We apply our proposed method to a large dataset, with 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve a satisfactory accuracy of 90% for identification of COVID-19 from CAP.",

Hypergraph learning was first introduced in (Zhou et al., 2007) , in which each node represents one case, each hyperedge captures the correlation between each pair of nodes, and the learning process is conducted on a hypergraph as a propagation process. By this method, the transductive inference on hypergraph aims to minimize the label differences between vertices that are connected by more and stronger hyperedges. Then, the hypergraph learning is conducted as a label propagation process on the hypergraph to obtain the label projection matrix (Liu et al., 2017) , or as a spectral clustering (Li and Milenkovic, 2017) .",

For our UVHL model, K nearest neighbors are connected for each vertex when generating hyperedges. We note that it is important to generate a suitable hypergraph structure for representation learning. However, how to select the best K value in this procedure is difficult. A large K will lead to high dissimilarity insider the hyperedge, while a small K may be not informative enough to the overall hypergraph structure. To select a suitable K, the following strategy is adopted to select K. First, a pool of candidate K values is set as [2, 3, ..., 20] in our experiments. Given a set of training data and corresponding testing data, we further split the training data into 5 folds. The 5-fold cross-validation is conducted on the training data, where different K are used.

Compared with SVM and MLP, our approach obtains better performance (i.e., 6.79% and 6.03% relative improvement in terms of ACC, respectively), demonstrating that the hypergraph based approach has the effective ability to tackle the pneumonia identification task. 2. Compared with other hypergraph based methods, i.e., inductive hypergraph learning (iHL) (Zhang et al., 2018) and transductive hypergraph learning (tHL) (Zhou et al., 2007) , our approach achieves relative gains of 5.47% and 3.82% in terms of ACC, respectively. 3. Besides the better sensitivity value, our proposed UVHL method achieves much higher specificity value compared with all other methods. This indicates that our proposed method can not only have high recall of COVID-19 patients but also be effective on filtering CAP patients, which is quite useful in practice. ",

Experimental comparison is demonstrated in Table 4 . Our method using regional feature has higher sensitivity, while the specificity is relatively lower, compared with the cases of using radiomics features. These results indicate that regional feature is better in finding the true positive COVID-19 cases, while radiomics features have the advantage of identifying CAP cases. When using both types of features in our proposed method, the performance becomes stable, along with both increasing sensitivity and specificity, as shown in the last row of Table 4. This observation demonstrates that our proposed method has the ability of jointly utilizing multi-type features and achieve better performance. ",

It should be noted that we have not included MLP, as MLP performs very badly when having very few training data. To do that, we investigate how the compared methods work with respect to a small scale of labeled data from 10 to 100 for COVID-19 and CAP respectively. In these experiments, 100 cases for each category are selected as the validation data. The training data selection process repeats 10 times and the average performance is calculated for comparison. Experimental results are shown in Fig. 5 . As shown in these results, we can observe that SVM performs inferior in all settings when given just very few labeled data, and the hypergraph based methods perform the best. We can also observe that our proposed method, i.e., UVHL, can achieve very stable performance when only a few labeled data are available, which justifies the effectiveness of our proposed method in these difficult situations.",

Confronting the challenging issues from noisy data and confusing cases with similar clinical manifestations and imaging features, our proposed method employs a hypergraph structure to formulate the data correlation among the known COVID-19 cases, the known as CAP cases, and the testing cases. Through this method, two types of CT image features (including regional features and radiomics features) are extracted for patient representation. To overcome the limitations of the noisy data, a data uncertainty measurement process is conducted to measure the uncertainty of each training case. Finally, a vertex-weighted hypergraph learning process is used to predict whether a new case is COVID-19 or CAP. We have conducted experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, including 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from 5 hospitals, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on identification of COVID-19 in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods.",
