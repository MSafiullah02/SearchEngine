Protein chip is a high-throughput method used to track the interactions and activities of proteins and to determine their function, including on a large scale [34]. Its main advantage lies in the fact that large numbers of proteins can be tracked in parallel. The chip consists of a support surface, such as a glass slide, nitrocellulose membrane, bead, or microtiter plate, to which an array of capture proteins is bound [35]. Probe molecules, typically labeled with a fluorescent dye, are added to the array. Any reaction between the probe and the immobilized protein emits a fluorescent signal that is read by a laser scanner [36]. Protein microarrays are rapid, automated, economical, and highly sensitive, consuming small quantities of samples and reagents [37]. The concept and methodology of protein microarrays was first introduced and illustrated in antibody microarrays (also referred to as antibody matrix) in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents [38]. The high-throughput technology behind the protein microarray was relatively easy to develop, because it was based on the technology developed for DNA microarrays, which have become the most widely used microarrays [39].",

Other labels can be used, such as affinity, photochemical, or radioisotope tags. These labels are attached to the probe itself and can interfere with the probe-target protein reaction [40]. Therefore a number of label-free detection methods are available, such as surface plasmon resonance, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanowire sensors (where detection occurs via changes in conductance), and microelectromechanical system cantilevers [41], [42]. All of these label-free detection methods are relatively new and are not yet suitable for high-throughput protein interaction detection; however, they do offer much promise for the future [43], [44].",

In the present study, 6 fixed early markers of corresponding febrile respiratory virus antibodies on an antibody chip were detected by means of fixing the antibodies and specific recognition of early virus markers that are found in human serum. The results showed that the specificity of selected antibodies for early markers are extremely strong, and the positive rate is \u223c100%, in which PIV, RSV, and BoV had 1 undetected case, probably because of experimental operation and other operator factors. However, the overall positive detection rate meets the required standard for a rapid-detection chip and has consistent accuracy compared with the ELISA method. The chip can be extremely useful for rapid detection of these 6 kinds of viral infection at an early stage.",
