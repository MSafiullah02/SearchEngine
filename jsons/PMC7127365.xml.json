Within the field, the spatial structure of tourism in cities has been an important research area (Pearce, 1998), focusing on the ways in which phenomena are arranged in space, and how this affects urban tourism planning and design applications. One important research direction is to empirically analyze the distribution of tourism-related phenomena, such as selected attractions, supporting facilities (Pearce, 1995), and accommodations in general, hotels in particular. These studies have identified distinct distribution patterns of particular tourism sectors in certain parts of cities, the most notable being clustering and linear patterns; these patterns can be explained by factors such as accessibility, land rent, planning restrictions, comparative shopping, and proximity to other tourism-related phenomena (Ashworth and Tunbridge, 1990, Pearce, 1987, Pearce, 1995). However, previous studies have largely focused on the influence of the surrounding environment on the selected tourism sector, and have not fully addressed the interactions and associations between all of the urban tourism phenomena.",

Nowadays, tourism occupies substantial amounts of space within urban destinations via tourist-historic urban cores, museums of all kinds, urban waterfronts, theme parks, and specialized precincts (Edwards et al., 2008). However, before the 1980s, studies of urban tourism were fragmented and it was not recognized as a distinct field (Edwards et al., 2008). An upsurge in interest in urban tourism was sparked by Ashworth's work in 1989, in which he stated that \u201c\u2026the failure to consider tourism as a specifically urban activity imposes a serious constraint that cannot fail to impede the development of tourism as a subject of serious study\u201d (Ashworth, 1989:33). In his pioneer work, Ashworth (1989) outlined four extant approaches to analyzing urban tourism: (1) the facility approach, which focuses on the spatial analysis of the location of tourism attractions, facilities, infrastructure, and zones; (2) the ecological approach, which focuses on the structure and morphology of urban areas and features the identification of functional zones or districts such as central business districts (CBD); (3) the user approach, which adopts a marketing perspective focused on tourists; and (4) the policy approach, which is concerned with a range of policy issues including infrastructure provision and destination marketing (Ashworth, 1989).",

The framework emphasized the identification of subject cells within a matrix defined in terms of scale (site, district, city-wide, regional, national, and international) and themes (demand, supply, development, and impacts). For instance, Rigall-I-Torrent et al. (2011) examined the effects of beach characteristics (such as beach length, width, sand type, or beach services) and distance of a hotel from the beach on sun-and-beach hotel prices at the regional level. A study at the city level by Yang et al. (2012) investigated potential factors contributing to hotel location choice in Beijing by incorporating both hotel and location characteristics. They found that star rating, years since opening, service diversification, ownership, the agglomeration effect, public service infrastructure, road accessibility, subway accessibility, and accessibility to tourism sites are all important determinants. While Ruggero and Rodolfo (2014) found that structural social capital is the strongest positive determinant of hotel performance, compared with weaker and generally not significant relations linking occupancy and control variables, such as category, size, location.",

They can be divided into two basic categories: (a) spatial decision support applications and (b) spatial statistics support applications. The former uses GIS systems that are specifically designed to handle spatial relationships to integrate four types of relevant data: tourist characteristics (e.g., Lau and McKercher, 2006), actual temporal\u2013spatial behavior (e.g., Shoval et al., 2011), landscape elements and tourist locations (e.g., Brown, 2006), and the images added to these locations (e.g., Gaughan et al., 2009). Then, a decision-support model is added to the GIS to analyze the overall temporal\u2013spatial behavior and to obtain some optimal conclusions (Bahaire and Elliott-White, 1999, Beedasy and Whyatt, 1999, Bertazzon et al., 1997, Boers and Cottrell, 2007, Brown, 2006, Dye and Shaw, 2007, Gaughan et al., 2009, Lau and McKercher, 2006, Perez et al., 2003, Shoval et al., 2011, Van der Knaap, 1999). The second type of application uses GIS not only to integrate data, but also to analyze the spatial patterns of tourism (Allen et al., 1999, Atasoy, 2010, Farsari and Prastacos, 2004, Porter and Tarrant, 2001). Allen et al. (1999) developed a parcel-based GIS model for assessing land-use change in the past; they built a spatial multivariate logistic regression model and selected 20 variables to predict the possibilities of land-use change for Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. However, the study focused on land-use change in a coastal tourism destination area without investigating the relationship between tourism phenomena and the changes in land use.",

The understanding of the determinants of hotel location selection is key to ensure coherent spatial planning at tourism destinations (Issahaku and Francis, 2013). According to previous studies, the main research approach used to explain location choices and spatial patterning of hotels are regression methods based on economic theory (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2014). The explanatory variables in these regression models are related to labor, culture, capital, and policy characteristics. In addition, as the hotel industry is closely linked to the real estate industries, which are significantly driven by economic conditions and external events, factors that affect these industries should be included in the analysis of the location of hotels (e.g., Yang et al., 2012). For instance, Porter and Tarrant (2001) identified and examined inequalities in federal tourism sites and campsites in Southern Appalachia based on five socioeconomic variables including race, education, household income, occupation, and local heritage.",

Tourism accommodation comprises a bundle of private attributes located in a specific physical environment which embeds public attributes, such as natural environment, public safety or cultural heritage (Albert et al., 2014). Seul (2015) found that hotels compete with more distant neighbors of similar quality than those who are quality-differentiated. In addition, the results also suggest possibility of cooperation among neighboring hotels similar in quality. To increase the demand, hotels are likely to be located in places that are proximate to their potential markets. They are usually highly clustered so as to obtain benefits from agglomeration effects. Barros (2005) found that hotels close to their potential markets are more efficient than their counterparts that have poor accessibility. A model proposed by Yokeno (1968) indicated that in a mono-centric city, spatial centrality is observed among hotels, due to the large demand for accommodation in the city center such as the central business district (CBD) or the tourist district (Yokeno, 1968, Shoval, 2006). Weaver (1993) argued that this is because tourists prefer a location where a variety of services are available.",

This was supported by Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2007, Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2011, who pointed out that hotel products and other tourism-related products can be viewed as bundles of public and private characteristics or attributes, and that the public attributes include characteristics of public good, such as non-rivalry and non-excludability (Samuelson, 1954). Some examples of attributes that contribute to the public good include, but are not limited to, environmental quality, public safety, public infrastructure availability, and cultural diversity. Therefore, these attributes and services are believed to influence both the tourists\u2019 utility functions on the demand side and the tourism agents\u2019 production functions on the supply side (Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2007). Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2007, Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2011 argued that the supply of attributes related to the public good and services influence hotel's room rates, and hence, generate higher revenue for hotels near rich public infrastructures. Based on this argument, hotels are likely to choose locations with a high rate of public good and an abundant supply of services.",

For this study, the level of the hotels, the dependent variable, is further categorized into lower-grade hotels (representing medium tariff hotels) and upper-grade hotels (high tariff A and high tariff B hotels).",

Cities compete for the opportunity to host events that draw large crowds of visitors because such visitors tend to spend a great deal in hotels and restaurants. As Hong Kong's hosting of the equestrian competitions at the 2008 Olympic Games may have affected the spatial distribution of star hotels, the influence of mega-events is also explored in this research. It should be pointed out that some factors such as socio-economic variables that may also affect the spatial distribution of hotels are not included in the model.

As mentioned above, previous studies have found that commercial and traffic land use types may have significant close relationships with hotel locations. Hence, this study focuses on these two land use types and broadly divided the land use data into three categories (commercial, traffic, and other). The area surrounding each hotel is defined using buffers with a 500-m, 1000-m, or 1500-m radii. By overlaying land use and buffers with GIS data, we are able to derive the land utilization in the environment surrounding each hotel.

The hotel locations reveal two main trends. First, there is continuous development in the central business district (CBD). Second, the hotels are expanding into surrounding districts. This pattern is related to the urban structure of Hong Kong. Older urban areas of Hong Kong are to the north of Hong Kong Island and Tsim Sha Tsui; between 1973 and 1990 Hong Kong began to develop nine new towns to cope with population growth. Due to the limited land resources, a large part of the rural land cannot be easily changed to other land use types (e.g., cargo port back-up or large development areas). Thus, urban areas have grown slowly since 1990 and the city now has a relatively stable spatial pattern (Fig. 2).",

Upper-grade hotels are more likely than lower-grade hotels to be closer to the commercial and business areas, rather than to attractions, suggesting that business facilities and shopping play an important role in determining the location of upper-grade hotels in Hong Kong. However, the negative coefficient of S_AN, which represents distance to shopping attractions, suggests that super shopping centers impose exclusivity obligations and thus investors cannot change land use in surrounding areas to build upper-grade hotels.

The results show that there is no difference between lower-grade and upper-grade hotels in terms of traffic accessibility. Hong Kong has highly convenient transport facilities giving each hotel access to potential tourism markets without needing extra accessibility. Thus traffic accessibility might not be an important consideration for establishing upper-grade hotels in cities with highly convenient transport facilities.",

            "text": "The discrete choice model explains hotel location choice based on the economic principle of utility maximization. It suggests that when hotel investors are facing a spectrum of choices of different locations, they are going to pick the most desirable location to maximize its associated utility subject to certain constraints (Yang et al., 2014). The non-significance of the land use diversification indicator (LUD) shows that the establishment and operation of upper-grade hotels are not dependent on diversity of land use. Compared to the significance of CLA, the non-significance of GFA is interesting. CLA is the area of land zoned for commercial use surrounding hotels, whereas GFA is the gross floor area for commercial use in a TPU. Theoretically, both of them should be strongly correlated as the former is the basis of the latter. The difference might be partly attributed to the way we collected the data. The GFA data are collected at the TPU level. Upper-grade hotels may be established in the most prosperous parts of a TPU, where commercial land is clustered, making the relationship between CLA and hotel location significant. When calculating GFA, we not only include the floor space of commercial and business buildings, but also some residential buildings, because in Hong Kong many buildings have shops on the lower floors and dwellings on the higher floors. These types of shops might not be any more attractive to upper-grade hotels than to lower-grade hotels. Furthermore, many shop owners rent space on higher floors to operate shops, the so-called \u201cUpstairs Shops.\u201d Obviously, tourists are unlikely to purchase goods in these shops.",

This indicates that the spatial pattern of hotels and their surrounding environments is stable within the 1000-m buffer. However, when the buffer radius is increased from 1000 m to 2000 m, the coefficients change significantly. Perhaps, when establishing a hotel, an investor focuses on the spatial structure within a certain distance (around 1000 m) of a hotel, but once established, the concrete jungle blocks the propagation of the spatial pattern beyond that limit.",

Theoretically, it contributes to the literature of urban tourism by conducting a spatial and temporal analysis of urban tourism phenomena. It examines two aspects of urban hotel spatial structure. The first is the effect of the built environment on hotel location choice, which is the main focus of many previous hotel studies. The second, neglected by most previous research, is a temporal analysis of the relationship between hotels and the built environment after the hotels are built. The results reveal that after a certain period of operation, the spatial structure of hotels and their surrounding built environments are significantly changed within a certain radius. Although this research is not able to directly examine how a hotel's operation influences the surrounding built environment, the significant temporal variation in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables such as the commercial land use may partly suggest that hotels influence the built environment in the surrounding area.",

These models are not only able to explore the relationship between the hotel level and built environment, but are also capable of examining temporal variation so that the changes in spatial structure can be investigated. To analyze the changes in the spatial patterns during the operation period, Model 11 is established.

The results suggest that in Hong Kong, traffic accessibility is not a significant variable, as Hong Kong is well known for its convenient public transport system, so developers need not consider this factor. Furthermore, the establishment of hotels may affect the surrounding land use within a 1-km radius; for example, it may increase the area of commercial land. This in turn may attract more upper-grade hotels, which prefer to be located near commercial centers. In addition, due to limited land resources and the concrete jungle, some upper-floor shops could be regarded as potential tourism products, but these have not been fully developed. More promotion efforts should be dedicated to these shops to increase the diversity of tourism products and the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise.",

If the historical data could be obtained, the results would be more convincing.
