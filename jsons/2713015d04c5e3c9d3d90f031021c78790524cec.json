Here we provide evidence that BW001, a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, induces anti-CVB3 activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In parallel, we have demonstrated that BW001 induces human PBMCs to express mRNAs of multiple types of interferon (IFN), including IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-o and IFN-g, and to express mRNAs of at least 11 subtypes of IFN-a. The induced IFNs may contribute to the anti-CVB3 activity. The results suggest that BW001 could be developed into a medication with the potential to treat CVB3 infectious diseases by inducing natural mixed IFNs.",

Based on lesions observed in newborn mice, coxsackie viruses are classified into two large groups, with 24 coxsackie viruses in group A, and six in group B (Pulli et al., 1995; Bolanaki et al., 2005) . Coxsackie A viruses affect skeletal muscle, while coxsackie B viruses cause pathological changes in several tissues, including the central nervous system, pancreas, liver and brown fat (Hyypia & Stanway, 1993) . Coxsackie B viruses are the etiological agents of a wide spectrum of human diseases, including mild respiratory infection, aseptic meningitis, and fatal myocarditis. Outbreaks of coxsackie B virus infection occur annually throughout the world (Patel et al., 2004) , and coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) is the most significant pathogen of acute and chronic myocarditis in humans (Liu & Mason, 2001; Patel et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Myocarditis caused by CVB3 experiences three phases. In phase 1, the virus enters and proliferates in the myocardium and subsequently activates the host immune system. In rare cases, if host immune activation continues unabated despite elimination of the virus, T cells may target the host's own tissue through molecular mimicry, initiating phase 2 of the disease. In this stage, cytokine activation and cross-reacting antibodies may further accelerate cardiac damage. The cumulative effect may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, when the disease develops into phase 3 (Rezkalla et al., 1996; Liu & Mason, 2001) . In general, it has been considered that antiviral therapy would be most effective in phase 1 of the disease process (Levi & Alejos, 2001; Liu & Mason, 2001) . Potentially effective antiviral agents include coxsackie receptor blockers (See & Tilles, 1992) , nucleoside analogues (Kishimoto et al., 1988; Heim et al., 1997) , immunoglobulin (McNamara et al., 1997; Bozkurt et al., 1999) and interferon (IFN) (Heim et al., 1995) .",

On the basis of the result shown in Fig. 1d , we isolated total mRNA from human PBMCs incubated with BW001 for 12 h. At this time point, the anti-CVB3 activity was obviously induced. Using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, the IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-o and IFN-g mRNAs in the total mRNA were analysed. b-actin-specific mRNA was used as an internal control. The results showed that the BW001stimulated human PBMCs expressed mRNAs of IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-o and IFN-g (Fig. 2a) , and that higher levels of mRNAS of IFN-a and IFN-b were induced than those of IFN-o and IFN-g. These results imply that the anti-CVB3 activity induced by BW001 may correlate with the expressions of IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-o and IFN-g. There is increasing evidence that IFN-a is a major factor in conferring antiviral activity to the human body, and we therefore evaluated the IFN-a produced by BW001-stimulated human PBMCs from a number of healthy donors. The PBMCs from six donors were treated with 3 mg mL \u00c01 BW001 or BW002 for 36 h, and the supernatants were then harvested for IFN-a detection with an ELISA kit. The results showed that BW001 could induce all six donors' PBMCs to produce IFN-a, and the levels of IFN-a ranged from 80 to 200 pg mL \u00c01 . The control ODN BW002 did not induce IFN-a (Fig. 2b) . The data confirm that BW001 can activate human PBMCs to secrete high levels of IFN-a. To clarify the subtypes of IFN-a that are induced by BW001 further, we tried to analyse the mRNA expression profile of 13 subtypes of IFN-a. Because of the amino acid homology among the subtypes of IFN-a, it is difficult to distinguish them by antibody-based methods such as ELISA. Furthermore, the absence of introns in the genes of IFN-a subtypes and the similarity in the size of genes of IFN-a subtypes make it impossible to discriminate the subtypes of IFN-a by RT-PCR. To conduct the analysis, total mRNAs were isolated from PBMCs from a healthy donor whose PBMCs were treated with BW001 produced 160 pg mL \u00c01 of IFN-a. The total IFN-a-specific cDNAs were amplified with IFN-a consensus primers in a RT-PCR and then were used to construct a cDNA library. The inserts of fifty clones in the library were randomly sequenced. After numerating, we found that the clones carrying IFN-a 1 and IFN-a 13 cDNAs comprised 24% of the clones in the library; IFN-a 2, 14%; IFN-a 7, 14%; IFN-a 5, 10%; IFN-a 16, 10%; IFN-a 21, 10%; IFN-a 8, 8%; IFN-a 4, 4%; IFN-a 10, 4% and IFN-a 17, 2%; and that clones positive for IFN-a 6 and IFN-a 14 were not detected (Fig. 2c) . The data demonstrate that BW001 can stimulate human PBMCs to express at least 11 subtypes of IFN-a mRNAs, suggesting that BW001 has the potential to stimulate the production of most subtypes of IFN-a.",

Upon invasion by viruses, the cells of the human body can produce various type I IFNs, including IFN-a, IFN-b and IFN-o, to limit the virus infection. In the human immune system, plasmacytoid dendritic cells expressing Toll-like receptor 9 are responsive target cells of CpG ODN with respect to antiviral reactions (Krug et al., 2001) . After the challenge of viruses, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of secreting very large amounts of IFN-a/b, at levels up to a thousand times more than are typically produced by most cells (Siegal et al., 1999) . The results presented here imply that a significant control of CVB3 infection might be achieved in vivo by the injection of BW001, which will induce type I IFN. IFN has been reported to inhibit the replication of viruses, activate natural killer cells (Pestka et al., 2004) , kill IFN-a produced from human PBMCs stimulated by BW001. Human PBMCs from six blood donors were cultured in the medium or in medium containing BW001 or BW002 (3 mg mL \u00c01 ) for 36 h, and the supernatants were harvested for IFN-a detection with an ELISA kit. Each symbol represents the average level of IFN-a produced from the human PBMCs from one donor, and the horizontal line represents the median of the level of IFN-a from six donors. Data from one representative experiment of three are shown. (c) IFN-a subtypes expressed by BW001-stimulated human PBMCs. Human PBMCs (donor 056315) were stimulated with BW001 for 12 h and then harvested for isolation of total RNA. The total cDNAs were synthesized using an oligo (dT) 18 primer and then used as templates for PCR amplification of IFN-as with IFN-a consensus primers. The IFN-a cDNA library was constructed by inserting the PCR products into pMD-18T plasmids. The inserts were randomly sequenced and the IFN-a subtypes were determined from the NCBI website. The inserts of 50 clones were sequenced, and the clones representing different IFN-a subtypes were counted. The results show that most subtypes of IFN-a can be expressed by BW001-stimulated human PBMCs.",

It is generally believed that the transcription of the various IFN-a species is modulated through multiple signalling pathways depending on the virus and types of cells infected. It has been found that a distinct virus may induce a characteristic profile of IFN production. For example, Newcastle disease virus preferentially induces the IFN-a 8 subtype in infected cells (Barnes et al., 2001) ; hepatitis C virus induces increased IFN-a 5 in PBMCs, Sendai virus causes human peripheral blood leucocytes to express at least nine IFN-a species, including IFN-a 1, IFN-a 2, IFN-a 4, IFN-a 7, IFN-a 8,  IFN-a 10, IFN-a 14, IFN-a 17 and IFN-a 21 (Nyman et al., 1998) . On the other hand, different IFN-a subtypes seem to exhibit different profiles of antiviral activity (Cajean-Feroldi et al., 2004) . For example, the antivesicular stomatitis virus effects in vitro are due to the existence of IFN-a 1, IFN-a 21, IFN-a 16, IFN-a 5, IFN-a 4, IFN-a 6, IFN-a 14, IFN-a 8, IFN-a 7, IFN-a 17 and IFN-a 10 (Schanen et al., 2006) . Recombinant human IFN-a 1, IFN-a 2, IFN-a 5, IFN-a 8 and IFN-a 10 could inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus. Among these, IFN-a 8 was the most and IFN-a 1 was the least effective (Koyama et al., 2005) . Our results that BW001 induced 11 IFN-a subtypes from the human IFN-a gene portfolio suggest that the anti-CVB3 activity induced by BW001 is correlated with the production of mixed IFN-a in a balanced ratio.",

In comparison with the most widely used recombinant IFN, BW001 may have several advantages in the treatment of virus infections. The first is that BW001 induces mixed IFNs, whereas the recombinant IFN currently used is usually a single type of IFN. For instance, recombinant IFN-a 2b is used to treat hepatitis C, hepatitis B, genital warts, Kaposi's sarcoma, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, malignant melanoma, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and Erdheim-Chester disease (Samuel, 2001; Braiteh et al., 2005; Kurokohchi et al., 2005; Sarin et al., 2005; Ward & Kugelmas, 2005) ; and IFN-b is used for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (Banwell et al., 2006; Derwenskus & Lublin, 2006) . Obviously, the synergistic action of mixed IFNs is more effective than a single type of IFN. The second advantage is that BW001, with a phosphorothioate backbone, is more resistant to endogenous nucleases and therefore has a longer half-life both in vitro and in vivo (Sands et al., 1994; Yu et al., 2002) . For comparison, in the human body, the half-life of a regular recombinant IFN-a is 3-4 h and that of the long-term recombinant IFN-a carrying polyethylene glycol is 35 h (Glue et al., 2000) . The third advantage is that BW001 induces endogenous IFNs with no immunogenicity in the human body. Repeated use of recombinant IFNs was reported to induce IFN-neutralizing antibodies that will hinder continuous therapy (Oberg & Alm, 1989; Lok et al., 1990) . It is noteworthy that naturally occurring IFNs have been proved to have a higher antiviral activity than their recombinant counterparts in vitro (Heim et al., 1995; Dahl et al., 2004) .",

(a) Photomicrographs of Hela cells protected by BW001-induced supernatant from CVB3 infection. PBMCs were treated with or without various oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (3 mg mL \u00c01 ) for 36 h, and the supernatants were used to treat Hela cells for 24 h. The cells were attacked by 10 \u00c2 TCID50 (50% tissue-culture infectious doses) of CVB3 for 48 h and then photographed (magnification \u00c2 100). (b) Anti-CVB3 activities of the supernatants from the PBMCs of eight healthy donors. The anti-CVB3 activity in the supernatant (10-fold dilution) was tested by a virus protection assay and represented as an OD value. Each symbol represents the anti-CVB3 activity of one supernatant. Each horizontal line represents the median value of anti-CVB3 activity. 'P': ODN vs. medium. (c) Dose effect of BW001 in inducing anti-CVB3 activity. The human PBMCs were cultured with various doses of CpG ODN for 36 h and the supernatants were assay for their anti-CVB3 activity. Each symbol represents the mean OD value AE SD of anti-CVB3 activity. (d) Kinetics of BW001-induced anti-CVB3 activity. The human PBMCs were cultured with ODNs at 3 mg mL \u00c01 for 96 h, and the supernatants were collected at various time points for assaying of their anti-CVB3 activities. (e) Comparison of anti-CVB3 activities between BW001-induced supernatants and recombinant human interferon (IFN)-a. PBMCs were cultured with 3 mg mL \u00c01 of BW001 for 36 h and the supernatants were collected to determinie their anti-CVB3 activities in parallel with the determination of the activity of recombinant human IFN-a.
