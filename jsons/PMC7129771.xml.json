            "text": "A microbiologist and pathologist, who was engaged in research on African Tick-borne Relapsing Fever, Joseph Everett Dutton (Fig. 1\n), became a victim of this disease. He was born on 9th of September 1874 in Higher Bebington, Cheshire, as the fifth son of the chemist John Dutton, was educated from 1888 to 1892 in the King's School of Chester, and entered the Liverpool Medical School and the Royal Infirmary in the same town. In 1897 he was graduated and was appointed to the George Holt Fellowship in Pathology. One year in the Departments of Surgery followed. He undertook his first scientific expedition in 1900 as a member of the third expedition of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine together with H.E. Annett and J.H. Elliott. They studied malaria and filariasis. At the beginning of 1901 Dutton travelled alone in the Gambia. It was the sixth expedition of the Liverpool School. On May 10, Dr. R.M. Forde, Colonial surgeon at the hospital in Bathurst, demonstrated a patient, where he (Forde) had found in the blood \u201cvery many actively moving worm-like bodies whose nature he was unable to ascertain\u201d (Dutton, 1902). The patient went back to England where Dutton examined him again, but he found no parasites in his blood. This patient, a 42-year-old government employee, came back to the Gambia several months later. Dutton, who was also back to the colony, examined him on December 15, 1901, and \u201cfound a flagellate protozoon evidently belonging to the genus Trypanosoma\u201d and he suggested \u201cthat the name \u2018Trypanosoma gambiense\u2019\u201d [should] \u201cbe given to this trypanosoma\u201d (Dutton, 1902). We have told earlier the whole story in this journal (K\u00f6hler, 2002). Because this patient was also ill with malaria Dutton did not realize the relation between sleeping sickness and trypanosomes. The tenth expedition of the Liverpool School led Dutton in 1902 together with J.L. Todd and C. Christy in 1903 to Belgian Congo. The King of Belgium placed a considerable amount of money at the disposal of this expedition. The researchers left Liverpool on September 23, and reached the Stanley Falls at the end of the year. Dutton's special interest was directed to tick-borne relapsing fever of the Central African type. He was able to infect monkeys by the bites of spirochaete-carrying soft ticks, Ornithodorus moubata. What he did not know, Philip Ross and Milne made the same experiment a few weeks before in Uganda. Dutton found also that Borrelia duttoni could pass into the eggs and larvae, and so confer infective potential on the tick of the succeeding generation (Manson-Bahr, 1951). Robert Koch (1906), who had no information about these results, found while he was in East Africa in 1905 that this transmission is possible up to the third generation. Christy and Dutton infected themselves with the disease, possibly at the dissection of a patient died of relapsing fever. Christy survived but Dutton died after the fourth relapse on 27th of February 1905 in Kosongo/Congo Free State. He was at the age of 31 years. The news about his death came relatively late to England because \u201cThe journey from Kosongo to the nearest telegraph station takes 2 months\u201d (Anonymus, 1905).",

He went to Buenos Aires, and back to Italy he became a coworker of S. Belfanti at the Istituto Sieroterapia Milano. Later he followed an academic career and was appointed Professor of Morbid Anatomy in Cagliari (1897), Modena (1898) and Pisa (1903). His main field of research was the aetiopathogenesis of infectious diseases, he published on bacterial toxins and immunity. In 1904 he dissected a patient died of Malta Fever and published the pathological findings (Carbone, 1904). Brucella melitensis was isolated by him and transferred to experimental animals. In order to get information about the toxin production he cultivated the microorganisms, and it seems that he infected himself by this way. Carbone died on 6th of September 1904, aged 41 years (Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, 1976).",

Howe and Miller (1947) reported on six cases of glanders occurring within 1 year (1944/45) in Camp Detrick, Frederick, MD. In the small laboratory a research program on glanders was performed. The first two cases occurred 2 weeks after an accident, when a technician dropped a flask containing a virulent suspension of Burkholderia mallei. The technician did not infect himself but two physicians staying in the laboratory fell ill. Two technicians became infected by routine laboratory work and the route of infection of two veterinarians was possibly aerogenic. The patients were cured by sulfadiazine.",

He was born on 14th of May 1860 in Vienna as the third child of Paul Ferdinand Hofmann von Wellenhof and his wife Klothilde, n\u00e9e Kraus (data from his thesis). He studied medicine in Vienna and Graz (where he was graduated), and was for some years First Assistant at the Institute of Pathology. Then he changed to the Institute of Hygiene, interrupted by some years of assistantship at the Institute of Zoology, all in Graz. As a result of his work in the Institute of Pathological Anatomy he reported on the detection of a \u201cpseudodiphtheria bacillus\u201d (later often cited as \u201cHofmann-Wellenhof'scher Bacillus\u201d); first on 20th of September 1887 at the 66th Assembly of the \u201cGesellschaft Deutscher \u00c4rzte und Naturforscher\u201d in Wiesbaden, followed by the detailed publication (von Hofmann-Wellenhof, 1888; K\u00f6hler, 2004). Before 25th of September 1889 (he was since 1888 assistant at the Institute of Hygiene at Vienna) he performed \u201cinfection experiments with the virus of glanders\u201d. Around October 8, his temperature raised and he had pain in his left chest (pleuritic rub). For some days he improved, then he complained about \u201crheumatoid discomfort\u201d. Eight days later purulent blisters and abscesses developed, and on 22nd of the month he was hospitalized. The clinical picture was that of acute glanders, and the dissection confirmed the diagnosis. The source of infection was unclear; an aerogenic infection was supposed. Georg von Hofmann-Wellenhof died on 23rd of October 1889, aged 30 years (Anonymus, 1889).",
