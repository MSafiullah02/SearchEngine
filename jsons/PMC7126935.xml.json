            "text": "Management and nutrition of the newborn calf during the first hours of life have the potential to permanently affect the lifetime performance of a dairy cow (Faber et al., 2005; Soberon et al., 2012). The role of colostrum in supplying IgG to the neonatal calf has been well described (Weaver et al., 2000; Godden, 2008). It is known that the timely delivery of colostrum, colostrum quality and quantity, and rate and amount of intestinal IgG absorption are essential components to guarantee a successful passive transfer in calves (Godden, 2017; Kertz et al., 2017). To achieve these goals, it is important to harvest a sufficient quantity of high quality colostrum. Release of oxytocin is the prerequisite for milk ejection and complete colostrum harvest. A continuous ejection of colostrum is dependent on the presence of adequate circulating oxytocin concentration (Wellnitz and Bruckmaier, 2001).",

            "text": "Milk ejection is an innate neuroendocrine reflex, which involves the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and sensory neurons in the teat. In neurosecretory terminals of the pituitary gland, oxytocin is stored and emptied into the bloodstream upon successful stimulation (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1996; Tan\u010din et al., 2001; Ma\u010duhov\u00e1 et al., 2004). Tactile stimulation of the teats results in the release of oxytocin and causes the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the mammary alveoli, whereby the alveolar milk fraction can be removed (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1998; Tan\u010din et al., 2001). While tactile stimulation of the teats is the primary sensory impulse for milk ejection, genital stimulation and the presence of the newborn calf are also potent stimuli for oxytocin release (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1998; Tan\u010din et al., 2001). Furthermore, it was shown that the presence of the calf during machine milking could influence the release of oxytocin and milk ejection (Akers and Lefcourt, 1982; de Passill\u00e9 et al., 1997; Lupoli et al., 2001).",

The average annual milk yield was 11,000 kg/cow. From drying off to the first 20 DIM, cows were housed in a naturally ventilated transition management facility providing freestall barns bedded with sand and ad libitum access to feed and water. Heifer and cow pens had 36 and 144 stalls, respectively. Cows were fed a TMR diet once daily consisting of corn silage and grass silage as forage with corn and canola-meal based concentrate formulated to meet or exceed the dietary requirements for dry and lactating Holstein cows (NRC, 2001). The approximate intake of MP was estimated at 1,189 g/d. All prepartum cows were vaccinated during the dry period and prepartum heifers before the first calving to improve colostrum quality. The vaccination against Escherichia coli, bovine rotavirus, and coronavirus (Rotavec Corona, MSD Animal Health, Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) was carried out 3 to 12 wk before calving. Postpartum cows were milked 3 times daily (0600, 1400, and 2200 h).",

Animals were moved into an individual maternity pen (3.5 \u00d7 3.5 m) bedded with fresh straw when the amniotic sac was visible or broken outside the vulva, or appearance of feet of the emerging calf were detected outside the vulva. A vaginal examination was conducted in every animal transferred to the maternity pen to assess dilatation of the vulva and cervix, as well as position, posture, presentation, and vitality of the calf. If the cow had not delivered the calf 1 h after the appearance of the amniotic sac or calf feet outside the vulva, calving assistance was provided to reduce calf losses (Schuenemann et al., 2011). Intensity of calving assistance was recorded using a 4-point scale (0 = calving in the prepartum pen; 1 = no assistance; 2 = assistance by 1 person; 3 = assistance by at least 2 persons).

The detection of the IgG concentration was based on coating and conjugating the IgG with anti-bovine IgG coupled to a peroxidase enzyme, which catalyzed a color change proportional to the IgG concentration of the sample. This color change was measured photometrically. Rabbit serum with anti-bovine IgG (5 \u03bcg/mL; A 5645, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) was pipetted into each well of a 96-well polystyrene plate (F96 Cert. Maxisorp Nunc-Immuno Plate, Thermo Scientific GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and blocked with a 0.5% gelatin PBS solution. The diluted colostrum samples were inoculated into the uppermost cavity of each column. In addition, the samples were diluted by using a 2-logarithmic dilution series with PBS-Tween buffer in a ratio of 1:2. Furthermore, the peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-bovine IgG and the substrate solution (332 \u03bcL of stock solution, 10 mL of tetramethylbenzidine buffer, 30% H2O2) were added, which started the enzyme reaction. By applying 50 \u03bcL of 1 molar sulfuric acid, the reaction process was stopped. The photometric intensity was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA Reader (GENios, Tecan Germany GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). The mean value of the IgG concentration in each well of one column resulted in the final colostrum concentration (mg of IgG/mL). Colostrum containing \u226550 mg/mL of IgG was regarded as high quality colostrum (McGuirk and Collins, 2004).",

According to Stelwagen and Singh (2014) the tight junction integrity of the mammary gland might be compromised following administration of high, nonphysiological, doses of exogenous oxytocin. The increased permeability is likely due to a disruption of the cell-cell contact as a result of the mechanical forces caused by the sudden alveolar contraction (Stelwagen and Singh, 2014).",

About 15 to 20% residual milk stays in the udder after milking. Nostrand et al. (1991) found that the use of exogenous oxytocin increased lactation milk production during the declining phase of lactation after peak milk yield. However, mean fat and protein percentages did not differ for oxytocin and control cows during lactation (Nostrand et al., 1991). We could not detect a difference in colostrum quantity for cows receiving exogenous oxytocin (OXY) and presumably a higher endogenous oxytocin concentration (CA) compared with CON cows.",

According to Bielmann et al. (2010), a digital refractometer can determine the IgG content in colostrum measured by RID with a correlation of r = 0.71 and acceptable test sensitivities and specificities. In our study there was only a weak correlation between sandwich ELISA and Brix refractometry (r = 0.44). Obviously, results obtained by sandwich ELISA and RID cannot be directly compared (Dunn et al., 2017). Therefore, the results in our study generated by sandwich ELISA limits the comparability with other studies using RID. It remains speculative why there was only poor agreement between the 2 methods. According to Elsohaby et al. (2017), variations in the correlation coefficients could be related to the different non-IgG components in colostrum. The measurement via Brix refractometry assesses IgG concentrations indirectly, through assessing total dissolved solids that affect the sucrose concentration. These are affected by dry period length (Rastani et al., 2005), vaccination status of the dam (Hodgins and Shewen, 1996), and season of calving (Morin et al., 2001). Further research is needed to compare the different analytical methods.",

Older cows seemed to produce colostrum with higher IgG concentrations, being exposed to antigens for a longer time during their life than younger cows. Antibodies are transferred from serum into colostrum and the colostral IgG concentration increases with the number of lactations. Consequently, the parity itself had a positive influence on colostrum quality (Conneely et al., 2013). In our study, primiparous cows and cows in 2nd parity had lower colostrum quality determined by both methods compared with older cows, which is consistent with previous studies (Pritchett et al., 1991; Gulliksen et al., 2008). Van Saun and Sniffen (2014) recommended prepartum feeding diets with at least >1,100 g/d, with 1,300 g/d of MP being better amount. The feeding diet in the present study was slightly above 1,100 g/d (1,189 g/d), but below the 1,300 g/d recommendation, which might explain the weak percentage (48%) of high quality colostrum found. Furthermore, it might explain the poor performance of 2nd parity cows. As 41% of colostral samples drawn from primiparous cows exceeded the cutpoint of 50 mg of IgG/mL, it is worthwhile to measure colostrum quality on farm and discard only the low quality colostrum.",

The exposure of cattle to high ambient temperatures during late pregnancy has been associated in different studies with poorer colostrum composition, including lower mean concentrations of colostral IgG and IgA, and other components, such as total protein, casein, lactalbumin, fat, and lactose (Godden, 2008). The negative effects of heat stress may influence DMI, resulting in nutritional restriction. Furthermore, a reduced mammary blood flow causes impaired transfer of IgG and nutrients from the blood stream to the udder, or impaired immune reactivity of mammary gland plasmacytes that produce IgA (Godden, 2008; Tao and Dahl, 2013). Part of the included animals were exposed to higher ambient temperatures during late pregnancy. Resulting heat stress could have affected colostrum quality, which could explain the low percentage of high quality colostrum found (48%). However, this remains an assumption because heat stress parameters were not assessed in the present study.",

Therefore, the results need to be validated with a multicentric study design. Also, the 3 treatment procedures were not randomly allocated on a cow basis but on a daily basis. This approach was chosen to increase compliance with farm employees. We are aware that a random allocation of each cow to 1 of the 3 groups would have been more robust. Based on previous experience, however, we assumed that a study design with a random allocation on a cow basis would have reduced compliance significantly. Furthermore, in the present study 2 treatment procedures (OXY and CA) were compared with a CON group. The option of an i.m. application of saline solution as a placebo in the CON group was rejected, which is an obvious study limitation. A study design with a second control group considering the application of a placebo might have enhanced the comparison of the different treatment procedures.",
