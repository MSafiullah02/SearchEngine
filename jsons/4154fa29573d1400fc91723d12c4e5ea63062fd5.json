Seventyfive (41.0%) patients had chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory system disease, malignant tumor, chronic liver and kidney disease, and others. All patients received antiviral and supportive therapies after diagnosis. By the end of February 13, 78 (42.6%) patients had been discharged and 21 (11.5%) patients had died, the rest 84 (45.9%) of the patients remain hospitalized in stable condition.",

According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 6 15 (71.4%) of the non-survivors matched the grade of overt-DIC (\u22655 points) in later stages of NCP (Table 2), the median time from admission to DIC was 4 days (range, 1-12 days). On the contrary, only one (0.6%) survivor matched the DIC criteria during hospital stay. In our enrolled patients with NCP, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and FDP levels, and longer PT compared to survivors on admission. By the late hospitalization, the fibrinogen and AT levels were also significantly lower in non-survivors; this suggested that conventional coagulation parameters during the course of NCP were significantly associated with prognosis. DIC appeared in most of the deaths. Patients presenting with a virus infection may develop into sepsis associated with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is well established as one of the most common causes of DIC; development of DIC results when monocytes and endothelial cells are activated to the point of cytokine release following injury, with expression of tissue factor and secretion of vonWillebrand factor. Circulation of free thrombin, uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants, can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis.8",

Their data suggest that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during SARS-coronavirus infection contributes to more severe lung pathology and that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plays a protective role following infection. In addition, Fatma Berri et al 10 reported that plasminogen contributes to inflammation caused by influenza through fibrinolysis, and 6-aminocaproic acid can protect against influenza. Presumably, fibrinolysis may also be induced following severe 2019-nCoV infection. The limitations of this report included that, as a relatively small, single-center study, the mortality and characteristics of enrolled patients may not be representative; our findings should be confirmed in an adequately powered clinical study. In addition, some patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission.
