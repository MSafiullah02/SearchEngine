            "text": "Coronaviruses infect a number of different vertebrate species and cause economically important diseases in people, pets, livestock and poultry [1]. Especially with the explosion of SARS in 2003 in several countries, coronavirus research has been becoming more ravishing [2, 3]. These coronaviruses are classified into three groups. One tightly clustered subgroup based on phylogenetic analysis and antigenic cross-reactivity contains canine coronavirus (CCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline coronavirus (FCoVs) [4, 5]. In fact, all of these viruses are antigenically so similar that they may be regarded as \u2018host range mutants\u2019 rather than as separate species [6, 7, 8, 9]. Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses with exceptionally large genome sizes (up to 31 kb). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used for virus identification [10, 11, 12]. However, PCR cannot distinguish several viruses at the same time from one sample and a positive amplification can be verified only by subsequent assays to elaborate sequence information. By overcoming this limitation, microarrays and biosensors have become valuable tools for viral discovery, detection, and genotyping [13, 14, 15, 16]. Microarrays that contain several thousand different DNA sequences (probes) can theoretically identify several thousand different organisms at one time and exhibit more sensitivity and specificity than those tests which employ a single target sequence. However, the high conservation of the coronaviruses represents a design challenge and a main hindrance for the identification. It is only when coronavirus microarrays can provide information for a wide range of viral strains and have no cross-reaction between different coronaviruses that they are then usable and practical for coronavirus detection.",

We constructed 104 cDNA clones of eight viruses including different genes by using different (4-15) pairs of primers designed for TCoV, CCoV, FCoV, FIPV, TGEV, PRCoV, BCoV and HRCoV, and a pair of universal primers designed for the RNA polymerase gene of coronavirus. Probes were compared to the database to ensure each probe was unique to the respective virus. The probe fragment was then obtained through plasmid PCR using the same primers as clone construction, precipitated with ethanol and suspended in 300 ng/\u03bcl with 50% DMSO for spotting purposes. Viral RNAs were extracted from the cryolysate of cell cultures infected with the examined coronavirus strains, labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dyes during PCR with different primer pair sets, and hybridized to the primary gene chip. Extensive cross-reactions between CCoV, FCoV, FIPV, TGEV and PRCoV were found and these clones may exist in a similar site in genes. Through the screening of hybridization, the ultimate specific gene chip was developed with the DNA fragments reamplified from the chosen recombinant plasmids without cross-reaction between different coronaviruses.",

In this study we tried to label the cDNAs of BCoV directly with Cy3-dCTP during reverse transcription and subjected them to specific hybridization, however no positive signal appeared. We think the amount of total vRNAs may be so low that the amount of cDNA labeled cannot meet the chip limit required. The amplification of sample cDNAs with PCR is therefore necessary to obtain satisfactory hybridization results. Secondly, the quality and concentration of probes is another important factor related with the signal intensity [23, 24, 25]. We obtained the probes by PCR and then purified and concentrated them to make certain that the OD260 was >0.1, the OD260/OD280 was >1.4, and the concentration of probes reached 50 \u03bcg/ml.",

It is expected to remain effective with possible mutants and to be of value when other new coronaviruses emerge. Because of the same PCR amplification and further Cy3 electrochemistry magnification, the chip method has a more than 1,000 \u00d7 sensitivity than PCR. As we just compare the sensitivity of BCoV detection using the gene chip and PCR methods with the same primer sets, in future we will compare other coronaviruses and different primer sets with these two methods in order to confirm the high sensitivity of DNA microarray technology.",
