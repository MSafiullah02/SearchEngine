            "text": "In the last 25 years, chemokines and their receptors have become promising targets in many fields of research. Because the chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 5 (CCR5) represent highly interesting candidates of the chemokine receptor family, much of investigations have recently been carried out in the development of ligands for these receptors. Maraviroc (1) is the first and to date the only FDA- and EMEA-approved drug on the market, targeting the CCR5 receptor (see Fig. 1) [1, 2]. The intention of this review is to elucidate the structure activity relationships of various small-molecule CCR2 and CCR5 ligands. The focus will be on the receptor binding affinity, antiviral activity for the treatment of HIV, and chemotactic activity for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In addition to the receptor binding affinity, many further aspects, which play a crucial role in drug development, will be discussed, e.g., physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, and the affinity to the human Ether-\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG), a K+-channel which would lead to severe side effects induced by the compounds.\n",

            "text": "The CCR2 receptor has become a promising target in the therapy of atherosclerosis. The concerted action of the chemokine ligand CCL2 and the CCR2 receptor plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes from the bone marrow into the arterial wall, which is known to be an early key step in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Lesions of the arterial endothelium are caused by mechanic injury or toxins and lead to migration of monocytes into the subendothelium that is mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. In the artery wall, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which develop to foam cells by taking up blood lipids [3\u20135]. Advanced plaques become unstable and can suddenly rupture. They expose their content to the blood, leading to platelet aggregation and occlusion of the blood vessel. Thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction result as serious long-term complications. With regard to the increasing number of patients, the use of small-molecule CCR2 antagonists in atherosclerosis has attracted significant attention in the last years [6]. The CCR2 receptor is linked also to progression and development of other inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [7].",

            "text": "The CCR5 and the CXCR4 receptors are mainly known as co-receptors required for the development of the HIV-1 infection [8]. The binding of gp120 of the virus to CD4 receptors on T-lymphocytes and macrophages leads to a conformational change of gp120 and enables the interaction with the CCR5 co-receptor. This triggers conformational changes in gp41, which leads to the fusion of the virus with the host cell [9]. At the beginning of an infection, the vast majority of the transmitted virus strains is M- or R5-tropic and uses the CCR5 receptor as a co-receptor. The T- or X4-tropic virus strains, which use the CXCR4 receptor as a co-receptor, are associated with an advanced disease progression [10]. A genetic polymorphism of the CCR5 receptor, characterized by a deletion of 32 bp in the gene segment encoding the receptor (CCR5\u039432 bp), results in a lack of function of the CCR5 receptor in homozygote individuals. These CCR5\u039432 bp mutations are found in 1\u20135% among uninfected Caucasian population and is exceedingly rare in infected patients (<0.1%), which indicates that CCR5\u039432 bp homozygotes are strongly resistant against HIV-1 infection [11\u201313]. The CCR5\u039432 bp mutant has also been linked to reduced susceptibility to coronary artery diseases and myocardial infarction [14, 15]. CCR5\u039432 bp polymorphism, as well as the function of the CCR5 receptor as a co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion, stimulated the beginning of several drug development programs by different pharmaceutical companies since the early 2000s.",

Hence, considering hERG channel blockade is essential to improve cardiovascular safety of novel CCR2 antagonists. The increase of overall polarity of the drugs by introduction of hydrophilic ring systems and substituents on side 2 has been a successful strategy to eliminate hERG inhibition [31]. Further, successful approaches are the attenuation of the pK\na value of the basic amine, modification of its steric environment, and the formation of zwitterions [32, 34].",

Despite the fact that human and murine CCR2 receptors show high sequence homology, binding affinities of ligands differ considerably among species [36]. INCB3344 (2) showed the IC50 values of 5.1 nM in hCCR2-binding and 3.8 nM in chemotaxis assay. 2 has been used as a tool in rodent in vivo efficacy models for multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and obesity and was effective in lowering macrophage levels in the targeted tissue [25, 26, 37]. Despite a high selectivity over other chemokine receptors, INCB3344 (2) was not a suitable clinical candidate due to its moderate hERG binding activity (IC50 = 13 \u03bcM) and inhibition of CYP 3A4 [6, 35]. This data led to further structural modifications of 2. The removal of the ethoxy group at the quaternary carbon at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring led to a loss of the mCCR2 affinity but retained the hCCR2 affinity. Previous SAR studies proved that the trifluoromethylphenyl residue on side 2 was crucial for the CCR2 binding affinity. The (R)-configuration at the position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring was also known to be important for the CCR2 affinity [38, 39]. The optimization involved the replacement of one phenyl ring by a heteroaromatic ring to reduce hydrophobicity (logP) as in INCB3284 (3). 3 includes a 6-methoxy-3-pyridyl moiety on side 1 and is a selective and potent CCR2 antagonist with IC50 values of 3.7 nM in hCCR2 binding and 4.7 nM in chemotaxis assay. In contrast to INCB3344 (2), INCB3284 (3) was a substrate for CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6, but had no inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP system. The inhibition of the hERG-associated potassium channel was rather low (IC50 = 84 \u03bcM) [35]. The balanced profile and safety data made INCB3284 (3) a promising candidate for phase I and phase II clinical trials, which were unfortunately terminated ahead of schedule [40].\n",

Another important aspect is the hydrogen binding potential of the urethane moiety and the restriction to small substituents at the benzoxazine heterocycle. SAR studies led to RS504393 (12) (IC50 = 89 nM) as the most affine compound of this benzoxazine class. The SARs of spiropiperidines were extensively investigated. In these spirobenzoxazine systems, the position 4 of the piperidine is disubstituted by a spiro-phenyl urethane system. Only piperidines or linear alkyl chains were accepted by the CCR2 receptor, other substituents were inactive or revealed reduced affinity. This group of compounds is highly selective for the CCR2 receptor [48].\n",

In order to eliminate the zwitterionic character of a piperidine-based amino acid derivative developed by Johnson&Johnson and to increase solubility, a cyclohexylazetidine system was prepared first [31, 55]. Different six- and five-membered heterocycles were introduced in the 4-position of the cyclohexane ring, which reduced the hERG channel activity. Finally, the thiazole derivative 19 was identified as the most potent candidate. A cis orientation of the thiazolyl and the azetidinyl substituents on the cyclohexane ring was found to be essential for the high CCR2 binding affinity [55]. Compound 19 revealed an IC50 value of 37 nM in the CCR2 binding assay and did not interact with the hERG channel (IC50 > 50 \u03bcM). A promising cardiovascular safety profile was confirmed in an anesthetized dog safety study. A high selectivity against other chemokine receptors was found, but the pharmacological profile remains to be reported [56]. In 2013, further variations of the heteroaromatic substituents at the N-acylglycine moiety were published, which started from 19 as a lead compound. Although various compounds with the high CCR2 affinity, promising functional activity and low hERG channel affinity were identified, none of these compounds displayed a promising pharmacokinetic profile [57].",

Replacement of the methylene moiety in 3-position by an amino moiety led to the closely related class of 7-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octanes. A systematic evaluation of the substituents on the exocyclic amino moiety resulted in 20, the most promising compound of this series. 20 displayed the high CCR2 affinity (IC50 = 31 nM) and low cardiovascular risk (hERG IC50 > 50 \u03bcM).

The most recent studies were based on the homology modeling, where in 2010 published crystal structure of the closely related CXCR4 receptor served as a template. The CXCR4 structure shows a higher sequence homology as well as a larger binding pocket than the structure of bovine rhodopsin. The binding pocket of the CCR2 receptor is formed by transmembrane domains TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 [28]. Glu291, located on the transmembrane region 7 (TM7), was proposed to be an important anchor residue of various CCR2 ligands, including spiropiperidines [48, 60, 61]. The central basic amine, present in most CCR2 receptor ligands, forms a salt bridge to this conserved acidic residue.",

The tetrahydropyran oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with both Tyr49 in TM1 and Thr292 in TM7. The biaryl system on the other site is fixed between the hydroxyphenyl moieties of Tyr120 and Tyr259 and to a lesser extent by His121 via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0-stacking interactions. His121 also interacts with Arg206 (TM 5), which results in a weaker ligand-histidine interaction. In the CCR5 receptor, His121 is replaced by phenylalanine (see Fig. 5), which cannot form interaction with arginine and therefore adopts an alternative rotameric conformation increasing the \u03c0-\u03c0-interactions. In case of TAK779, the residues Tyr49, Trp98, Tyr120, and His121 are discussed to form an aromatic cluster contributing to the CCR2 receptor binding [60, 62]. For the binding of the spirocyclic antagonist RS504393 (12), Glu291 and Asp284 were identified as hydrogen bond partners for the tertiary amine within the piperidine ring [48, 49]. Expectedly, the binding of the CCR2 antagonists devoid of basic amine was not affected by Glu291 mutations [22, 23].",

Compounds 49 and 50 demonstrated similar CCR5 binding affinities in low micromolar range, indicating no advantage of the cyclized N-substituent of 49. The SAR investigations, in which the substituent R\n2 of the acyl group was varied, revealed that neither (hetero)aromatic nor aliphatic groups increased the CCR5 receptor affinity (Table 15). The phenylacetyl derivative 53 was the only compound with potency in the high sub-micromolar range. Introduction of substituents at the o- and m-position of the phenylacetyl group did not significantly affect the binding affinity. However, an increase in affinity was observed after introduction of polar electron-withdrawing substituents in p-position. In particular, sulfamoyl (55), N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl (56, 57), and methylsulfonyl (58) groups showed nanomolar CCR5 affinities. Replacing the methyl (56) with the ethyl group (57) at the amide N-atom slightly increased the CCR5 affinity (Table 15). Replacement of the amide substructure by a sulfonamide moiety was shown to be detrimental, whereas the introduction of a urea moiety instead of the amide retained the CCR5 affinity. Compounds 55, 56, and 57 showed no affinity towards CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CXCR1, and CXCR2 receptors. The N,N-dimethylsulfonamide 57 displayed micromolar affinity to muscarinic and serotonergic receptors as well as the hERG channel [45]. Therefore, the methyl sulfone 58 was chosen as the new lead compound for further ligand development.\n",

Introduction of one 60 or two 59 fluorine atoms into the p-position of the phenyl rings resulted in decreased CCR5 affinity. In contrast, one chlorine atom in p-position (61) was highly beneficial. Therefore, further substituents in p-position of one phenyl ring, retaining the other phenyl ring unsubstituted, were investigated. Compounds with strongly electron-withdrawing substituents such as trifluoromethyl (62), cyano (64), and methylsulfonyl (66) were highly potent, but also the methoxy derivative 65 demonstrated high CCR5 affinity (Table 16). Electronic effects alone are not sufficient to explain the SAR. The weakly potent difluoro (59) and 4-fluoro (60) compounds as well as the methylsulfonyl (66) derivative demonstrated sufficient metabolic stability and a good pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The potential of the fluorine atoms to reduce oxidative metabolism on the phenyl rings of the diphenylpropyl moiety indicated a possible approach to improve oral bioavailability in this series of CCR5 ligands [47].\n",

In the oxagranatane exo-80 (Table 20), the basicity of the central amino group is reduced to pK\na 6.0 compared to pK\na 7.8 of exo-78. However, the hERG channel affinity was not reduced, which suggested that the basic center itself is not essential for hERG binding [90]. Docking of 78 into a hERG channel model indicated a lipophilic interaction of the phenyl ring of the benzimidazole moiety with the hERG channel residues. In order to inhibit this overlap, a triazole moiety (84) instead of the benzimidazole ring (78) was introduced, which dramatically decreased the hERG affinity. The introduction of an isopropyl side chain at the triazole motif (85) increased the antiviral activity, but the added lipophilicity increased the affinity to the hERG ion channel as well. The cyclobutyl group of the amide 78 was shown to overlap nicely with the lipophilic binding pocket of the hERG channel. In order to interrupt this interaction, polar fluorinated groups were introduced (86, 1). The 4,4-difluorocyclohexyl derivative 1 does not show any binding to the hERG channel, even at a concentration of 1,000 nM. Combined with low nanomolar antiviral potency (Table 22) [89], a broad anti-R5 HIV-1 spectrum and no inhibition of CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, and 2D6 enzymes compound 1 were characterized as an inverse agonist of CCR5 receptors, stabilizing the receptor in the inactive conformation [91].\n",

The tropane N-atom is protonated and forms a salt bridge with Glu283. The NH moiety of the amide forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic group of Tyr251 (Fig. 7). The length of the propyl chain between the two N-atoms correlates with the positions of Glu283 and Tyr251 in the receptor. The fluorine atoms in the cyclohexane ring form two hydrogen bonds with Thr195 and Thr245. The phenyl group interacts with five aromatic residues, Tyr108, Phe109, Phe112, Trp248, and Tyr 251 in the binding pocket. The interaction of the benzene ring with Trp248 is believed to prevent the activation-related motion of the receptor, which underlines the inverse agonist character of maraviroc (see Fig. 7) [95]. Compared to the CXCR4/IT1t structure [30], the binding site of maraviroc (1) was found to be deeper, without any contact to extracellular loops. The availability of the X-ray crystal structure of the CCR5 receptor will help to promote the development of novel potent CCR5 ligands with optimized properties.\n",

The structure of PF-232798 (90c) resulted from an alternative approach which intended to circumvent the CYP 2D6 and hERG activity of the HTS lead UK-107,543 (51). The introduction of the tropane substructure instead of the piperidine moiety was previously proven to reduce CYP inhibition [1] and was therefore incorporated into the new lead compound. The lipophilic imidazopyridine and benzimidazole substructures of 51 and 78 were shown to be responsible for the inhibition of CYP 2D6 and high hERG binding [80]. In order to prevent lipophilic interactions with the hERG ion channel, the imidazopyridine substructure was replaced by more polar 1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine, which led to the 3-substituted (89a\u2013c) and 1-substituted (90a\u2013d) series of compounds. The methyl carbamates 89a and 89b demonstrated high hERG inhibition. Reducing the size of the amide substituent to an acetyl group (89c) significantly increased the selectivity for hERG ion channel within the series 89. Also the hERG affinity was reduced by incorporation of a m-fluoro substituent into the phenyl ring (89b). Switching the substitution position of the 1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine slightly improved the gp160 inhibition from 89c to 90a, but was detrimental in terms of hERG binding. The lowest hERG inhibition (IC50 = 12 \u03bcM) could be achieved by introduction of an isopropoxycarbonyl substituent 90c (Table 24). Compound 90c demonstrated complete oral absorption in rat and dog that was accompanied by improved metabolic stability compared to maraviroc (1) and other compounds in this series. Moreover, PF-232798 (90c) displayed antiviral activity against maraviroc-resistant viruses and was therefore chosen as the follow-up clinical candidate of maraviroc (1) [98].\n",

The key features of the tropane moiety are an increased steric hindrance around the basic amino group and restricted conformational flexibility of the molecule. In order to retain the steric hindrance, the introduction of an additional methyl moiety into the propyl chain was envisaged. Several heterocycles as well as different amido substituents were screened for their antiviral activity, oral bioavailability, and low propensity towards hERG ion channel inhibition and interaction with a range of CYP enzymes.

Increasing the size of the alkyl substituent to a cyclohexyl group (93) inhibits the interactions with the hERG channel leading to an affinity higher than 10 \u03bcM. Enantioselective synthesis of 93 allowed the determination of (R)-93 as eutomer, with a 100-fold higher antiviral activity than the (S)-enantiomer. Bioisosteric replacement of the 1,3,4-triazolyl residue of (R)-\n93 by a 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl ring in (R)-\n94 resulted in a highly metabolically stable and potent CCR5 ligand. The 1,2,4-triazole (\nR)-94 displays excellent whole-cell antiviral activity (IC90 = 2.6 nM), complete oral absorption in rat, and does not inhibit human CYP 1A2, 2C9, and 2D6 enzymes.

The role of CCR5 receptors in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases led to an increased interest of using CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [106].

A few chemokines show a one-to-one specificity as CCL2 is specific for the CCR2 receptor, while other chemokines are promiscuous and bind to different receptors [109, 113, 114].

Comparative analysis revealed 66 % sequence identity in general between CCR2 and CCR5 receptors and 82 % identity in the active site. Receptor homology modeling studies predicted a ligand binding pocket of the CCR2 receptor formed by TM2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. In the CCR5 receptor TM1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 form the binding pocket for CCR5 inhibitors, which is located at the extracellular region and is partly covered by the extracellular loop. Both CCR2 and CCR5 receptors possess glutamic acid in the anchor site in TM 7, Glu291 in CCR2 receptors, and Glu283 in CCR5 receptors. Glu291/Glu283 is essential for the interaction with protonated tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium ions. Superposition of CCR2/CCR5 binding sites revealed that all residues are identical except three: Ser101/Tyr89, His121/Phe109, and Arg206/Ile198, which differ considerably in their electronic and hydrophobic properties.",

Using computational calculations, low-energy three-dimensional receptor conformations of human CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were created, and the binding sites of 15 within the CCR2 and CCR5 receptor were predicted. Mutation experiments in which single amino acids were replaced within the receptor structure were performed, and after transient expression in the L1.2 cells chemotactic and competitive binding experiments to CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were carried out. Based on these data, it was postulated that Trp98/Thr292 in the CCR2 receptor (Fig. 3) and Trp86/Tyr108 in the CCR5 receptor (Fig. 5) were significantly associated with the efficacy of TAK-779. His121 in the CCR2 receptor was also important for antagonistic efficacy and was replaced by Tyr108 in the CCR5 receptor. An altered rotational orientation of TM3 is responsible for a different positioning of these aromatic residues in both CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. A comparison of quaternary ammonium salt TAK-779 (15) with antagonists including a tertiary amine showed differences in binding of these interacting residues. Depending on Glu291 in the CCR2 receptor and Glu283 in the CCR5 receptor facing either TM1 and TM2 or TM3 and TM6, different orientations of TM7 are possible: The first receptor conformation leads to a receptor activation network formed between TM 1, 2, 3, and 7, which is supposed to be required for the receptor activation by the chemokine. The second conformation is expected to be stabilized by antagonist binding [62].\n",

The development of 106 started from a potent CCR2 antagonist with an indolylpiperidine scaffold. It showed selectivity over the CCR5 receptor, but due to its high structural similarity with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), this indolylpiperidine was not selective and interacted with several serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. In order to improve the selectivity, a conformational restriction of the indolylpiperidine via a tropane moiety was performed, and the steric bulk around the basic amine was increased. Moreover, the flexible pentyl chain was exchanged by a methylcyclohexyl linker. The conformational constraint of both the piperidine ring and the pentyl alkyl chain led to 1,000-fold increased CCR2 selectivity over a number of serotonin and dopamine receptors but retained high CCR2 affinity. In contrast to previous compounds, 106 showed moderate CCR5 affinity (IC50 = 4,000 nM) (Table 30) [41, 119].",

Merck developed further a new class of promising CCR2 antagonists based on the \u03b3-aminobutyramide core. The screening of Merck\u2019s sample collection led to some lead compounds, which upon further optimization resulted in ligands 108, 109, and 110 (Table 31) with both CCR2 and CCR5 antagonistic properties. A high structural similarity to known CCR5 antagonists was achieved by incorporation of a substituted piperidine ring. Compound 108 with the 4-phenylpiperidine moiety demonstrated moderate binding affinity to the CCR2 receptor (IC50 = 150 nM) as well as to the CCR5 receptor (IC50 = 72 nM). 108 showed improved potency compared to previously characterized unsubstituted piperidine analogs. Further variations of the phenylpiperidine moiety by 3-phenylazetidine, 3-phenylpyrrolidine, and 4-phenylazepane showed that the piperidine ring was best in terms of CCR2 and CCR5 affinity. The spiro[indene-piperidine] 109 was about 2-fold more active with IC50 values of 80 nM (the CCR2 receptor binding affinity) and 30 nM (the CCR5 receptor binding affinity), whereas its closely related saturated spiro[indane-piperidine] analog was less potent. The introduction of a methyl group in various positions of the \u03b3-aminobutyramide backbone and the piperidine ring decreased potency with the exception of a methyl moiety in the 3-position of the piperidine ring. However, the CCR2 and CCR5 affinity is strongly dependent on the relative and absolute configuration of the piperidine derivatives.\n",
