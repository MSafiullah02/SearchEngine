In this context, the scattering of US waves produces artifactual images characterized by horizontal reverberations of the pleural line (A-lines) and mirror effects.",

Moreover, their heterogeneity may be exploited as a means to characterize the alterations of the lung surface. 5 Another well-known phenomenon linked to the increase in subpleural lung density (in the absence of consolidated tissue) is the coalescence of many vertical artifacts in more extended echogenic patterns, in which the individual artifacts are still recognizable or fused in a single homogeneous subpleural echogenic area (white lung). When the subpleural density goes toward the value of 1 g/mL (about that of the solid tissue), then consolidations appear.",

Reparative processes with pneumocyte hyperplasia and interstitial thickening can occur. The advanced phases show gravitational consolidations similar to those of ARDS. There are hemorrhagic necrosis, alveolar congestion, edema, flaking, and fibrosis. 9 An analysis of the available computed tomographic (CT) data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia 10 shows largely bilateral lesions that are patchy and also confluent, appearing as ground glass or with a mixed consolidative and ground glass pattern. Ten percent of lesions with a crazy-paving appearance are reported. The lesions often have a wedge-like appearance with a pleural base. Major consolidations may show air bronchograms. Pleural effusion is absent. Patchy or confluent lesions tend to be distributed along the pleura. The lobe most frequently affected is the lower right lobe, followed by the upper and lower left lobes. The posterior lung is involved in 67% of cases. 11 Given that LUS can identify changes in the physical state of superficial lung tissue, which correlate with histopathologic findings and can be identified on CT but remain hidden in a large percentage of chest radiographs, the role of LUS can be relevant in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. It should also not be underestimated that, in experimental models of ARDS, LUS has proved capable of detecting lung lesions before the development of hypoxemia.",

The first pulmonary manifestations are represented by a patchy distribution of interstitial artifactual signs (single and/or confluent vertical artifacts and small white lung regions). Subsequently, these patterns extend to multiple areas of the lung surface. The further evolution is represented by the appearance, still patchy, of small subpleural consolidations with associated areas of white lung. The evolution in consolidations, especially in a gravitational position, with or without air bronchograms, and their increasing extension along the lung surface indicate the evolution toward the phase of respiratory insufficiency that requires invasive ventilatory support. Figures 1 and 2 show the US characteristics of the interstitial syndrome present in intermediate COVID-19 pneumonia. Early viral pneumonia shows few, usually bilateral, pulmonary lung areas characterized by single or bundled, pneumogenic-type vertical artifacts, or small areas of white lung. Advanced COVID-19 pneumonia shows evident consolidations, especially in the posterobasal regions, and widespread patchy artifactual changes. This pattern is similar to that of ARDS. In this context, the development of algorithms able to aid the clinician with a real-time detection and localization system is of great interest. 12 ",

The well-known advantages of LUS in terms of portability, bedside evaluations, safety, and the possibility of repeating the examination during follow-up cannot be overlooked and should be exploited and implemented. Moreover, the possibility of performing a LUS examination at the bedside minimizes the need for transferring the patient, with a potential risk of further infection spreading among health care personnel. Comparison with chest radiography and/or a lung CT scan might help in designing a proper diagnostic workup according to the general and local technological and human resources.",
