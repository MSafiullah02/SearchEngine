Although the journal has become more technical as the field of energy-related research has matured, we expect the articles that we publish to inform energy-related policy. Mathematical modeling, econometrics and other approaches should serve only to support the policy issues being examined. Modeling should be a means rather than an end. Papers that are focused on technology assessment, mathematical modeling, econometrics and other approaches with a few policy implications tacked on at the end, or no deeper and explicit new policy insights and implications derived from the analysis, do not belong in Energy Policy. They should be sent to more technically oriented journals.",

            "text": "\nEnergy Policy has a continuing mission of advancing and informing policy issues about energy use and supply. Fulfilling this mission requires well-researched articles using rigorous research methods and thinking about energy policy issues. We consider a continuum of papers, from those that make more substantial contributions to policy to those that make more substantial contributions to methodology, but we expect all papers to have a focus on policies about energy supply or use.",
