Email: Rob.ranzijn@unisa.edu.au The aim of this paper was to examine to what extent the Commonwealth Government's stated policy goals of independence and self-provision in old age are achievable. A qualitative study was conducted with thirty middle aged adults in Adelaide and Whyalla in South Australia, either presently employed, unemployed, or retired. In general, participants with a history of continuous stable employment believed they were in a good financial situation and were confident about their future, but many of the participants had a history of precarious employment, no financial security, and expected to rely primarily on Government support in their old age. Transport and mobility were identified as key links between financial situation and lifestyle options. It is concluded that Commonwealth and state governments need to intervene to enable mature aged people to become and remain employed and also to build up the public housing stock.",

Given the diverse nature of ageing as a field of study, research students are widely spread across the disciplines. This creates challenges in engaging emerging researchers in the wider ageing research community or policy arena, and in supporting them to remain in the field. While more information about current postgraduate research students in ageing will become available through the new Ageing Research On-line Website and other national initiatives, little is currently known about the directions existing postgraduate research on ageing is taking, or the motivation, needs and future career intentions of the students. Such information is crucial if appropriate strategies are to be developed to harness the expertise required in tackling the new ageing research agenda. This paper draws on the findings of an exploratory study, undertaken by the ACA, of an Australia-wide convenience sample of PhD students in ageing. The purpose of the study was to gain an insight into their motivations, experiences and future career intentions. The paper also identifies from the literature some of the strategies used in other countries to build research and career pathways for ageing researchers and describes recent initiatives at the ACA to develop emerging researchers in ageing. The key challenges and implications for research, education and policy will be considered.",

            "text": "There is a growing body of international literature focusing on older people as volunteers, but little is known about older people volunteering for research studies. This paper aims to expand our knowledge base in this area by presenting data from a study of volunteers for a research registry based in The Australasian Centre on Ageing at The University of Queensland. Specifically, the paper presents data on the motivations of older people to volunteer for the registry. These data suggest that there are four main factors explaining why older people wish to participate in research studies. First, older people are seeking ways to make a contribution to society and to research. Second, they are looking to be more informed, particularly in relation to the findings of research studies. Third, participants are seeking social interaction. Fourth, they wish to be involved in the broader University environment. Thus, participating in research as a volunteer provides opportlvlities for older people to become involved in ageing issues as well as create value in their own lives. The presentation discussed the implications of these findings for researchers and policy-makers. This presentation is based on 50 in-depth interviews with male defence service veterans, including cohorts from both World War I1 and Vietnam. The study was a joint research initiative between the University of South Australia and the Department of Veterans Affairs' (national office). The presentation will address various issues concerning ageing men's nutrition utilising a holistic approach to health, including physical, social, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects. Recommendations presented to the Department of Veteran's Affairs will be identified. It is arguable these recommendations will outline implications concerning health promotion for future research and community health programs affecting ageing men and nutrition. fostering community action, developing personal skills and re-orienting health services. The results concluded that in theory, an aged care facility can move beyond an institutional medical model of care to one that is a health promoting aged care facility that promotes quality of life, and a happier healthier life for residents, relatives and staff. In practice, however, it is necessary for governments and policy makers to develop healthier public policy that is developed in collaboration with residents, relatives, staff and the community. These stakeholders could work in partnership with policy makers to promote wellness, foster relationships and reorient aged care services from a treatment model to one that promotes health and wellbeing. It is also necessary to reduce the negative stereotyping attributed to aged care and ageing, reduce staff turnover, provide improved and increased aged care services and promote education through the school curriculum, to the community and within aged care, but from a specialist aged care perspective. Education is also important for the elderly themselves to enable them to become empowered in their own informed life decisions. Of particular interest, the findings revealed that student nurses feel confronted by the 'old wrinkly bodies' of residents during the process of providing care. They describe being shocked and horrified at what they saw as the 'decay and deterioration' which brought them face to face with the reality of getting old. With the ongoing support of the Registered Nurse preceptors, the students worked through the issues, reconciled their ageist attitudes and came to perceive the elderly residents in a different light. At the completion of their experience, over 90% of the students reported that they would consider aged care as a future employment option.",

            "text": "Ms Janet Taylor Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT) are acknowledged as having a key function in assessing the health and social needs of elderly clients, and historically, they have assessed the medical, psychological, social and functional status of older clients and make recommendations on care plans to meet identified needs. Revised operational guidelines released in 2002 stipulate that ACATs also have a responsibility to work with other providers to facilitate clients' access to recommended services to give effect to the care plan. The Review of the Tasmanian Aged Care Assessment Program identified a concern that ACATs focused primarily on the early phases of the assessment process and gave insufficient attention to consultation with service providers in developing and following through on recommended care plans. Concurrently, the Review also identified problems with the wide range of clients assessed by ACATs; specifically, ACATs routinely conducted assessments on clients with no or few indicators of risk of admission to residential care or need for a high level of support from community services. An analysis OP client flows indicated that at least 15% of ACAT assessments would more appropriately be performed by another agency with a more broad based community focus. The two issues of high initial client flows and lack of follow through are interlinked: ACATs reported that they were too busy performing assessments to engage in appropriate networking and follow through activities. This paper presents data to inform these issues and the recommendations made by the review team to address them by way of (a) screening of ACAT intake, (b) active involvement of other agencies in developing care plans and (c) follow through to sign off on implementation of the care plan. Prior to admission of an elderly person to a residential aged care facility (RACF) an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) must assess their level of dependency. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, following admission, some elderly people are reassessed as requiring a different level of care. A study was conducted both to determine the incidence of the re-assessment of elderly clients following admission to a RACF in Tasmania and to gain insight into the variables that make elderly clients vulnerable to re-assessment. The approach involved the conduct of focus group discussions with Directors of Nursing of RACFs to inform the development of a survey, which was then administered to all residential aged care providers in the State, with a 75% response rate representing 70% of the total aged care places in the State. The findings highlighted that more than 10% of elderly people admitted to a RACF in Tasmania are subject to a re-assessment within 60 days of admission. This results in them either being reclassified from high to Iow care or vice versa. Aged care providers appear to lack confidence in the ability of ACATs to accurately assess the level of care residents will require following admission to a RACF This was apparent in the finding that 50% of respondents conduct their own independent off-site assessments. The study also revealed a number of variables associated with re-assessment.",

The risk to caregivers of poor health outcomes is accepted, but the mechanism by which the chronic stress of caregiving results in poor health is less well understood. It is hypothesised that such a mechanism may be allostatic load, a novel concept specifying physiological systems that may suffer cumulative wear and tear as a result of chronic stress, leading collectively to poor health. The current study is a 3year NHMRC-funded longitudinal comparison of three groups: 80 new dementia spouse caregivers, 120 veteran caregivers, and 60 non-caregivers. Because of expected differential attrition rates, groups were oversampled in Year 1 to achieve similar group numbers in Year 3. Caregivers were sampled from the Memory Disorders Study Unit in Adelaide, and non-caregivers from the SA Electoral Database. Measures include health status indicators, allostatic load markers, stress-health mediators (mastery, social support, positive and negative affect, family functioning, community service use), environmental stress (life events) and psychological stress (appraisal), and caregiver-specific stress measures. The study is now early in its third year. Results from Year 1 indicate group differences in stress, but not in allostatic load. However there was a modest relationship between indices of allostatic load and both environmental and psychological stress. Initial analysis of Year 2 data indicate an increase in allostatic load for participants who relinquished care after Year 1. Allostatic load appears responsive to changes in stress; whether this leads to poor health will be evident from Year 3 data. Interactions with the health and welfare system were mixedsome were highly supportive and some were somewhat counter-productive.",

The objective clock time demands of caring are well known. The influence of intra and inter personal, subjective time and space organisation of the unit is less so. The mutual invasion of privacy, the intrusion of age specific worldviews, the lack of psychological personal space and time, and the re-scheduling of tempo, may be some manifestations of the differing time and space organisation.

Domestic violence is one aspect of elder abuse that has received very little attention other than as a category of elder abuse and located within a care model of situational stress and/or aggressive behaviour. Even less is understood about the interface between domestic violence, elder abuse, Alzheimer's and other dementias. This paper provides an analysis of the literature in relation to Abuse, Dementia and Older Women and raises questions about both the domestic violence and elder abuse paradigms in relation to older women's experiences of domestic violence. Both paradigms are critiqued for their blindness: domestic violence to age and elder abuse to gender. The role of dementia and associated aggressive behaviour within this blindness is also considered. Arguments are presented for a shift in both paradigms. Such shifts will influence changes to the service response, policy development and organisational culture to ensure that rights to safety and well being are not compromised.",

However, for others the request may be prompted by inadequate attention to factors that are possible to ameliorate. The challenge then is to ensure that the best care possible is provided to the patient (and hisher carer). Recommendations from the study, including those relating to palliative care, will also be discussed. An aged care facility is where many of us will spend our last months or years, and increasingly it is the place where we will die. As a result the role of aged care facilities to provide care for the dying has evolved and there is increasing pressure to provide services from admission to death within the one setting. The availability of palliative care has been advocated to ensure physical, psychosocial and spiritual care is provided. However, to define a patient as palliative may not be appropriate, rather one should ask whether and what palliative care skills are required at a given time. As such palliative care should be viewed across a spectrum with three componentsa palliative care approach, palliative interventions and specialist palliative care. This paper reports the findings from an NHMRC study conducted in South Australia during 200213 that explores these components in residential aged care facilities. Conducted in two stages, stage one involved a survey to randomly selected residential facilities in South Australia to quantify resident deaths from cancer vs non-cancer diseases, the proportion of current residents who require palliative care, existence of specific palliative care policies and the interface with specialist palliative care services. Stage two describes the profile of 69 residents with a non-cancer diagnosis whose care needs and specialist palliative care involvement were longitudinally tracked over a two month period. Discussion will include implications for palliative care services and practitioners.",

Planners of future health care services will need to make allowance for these variations. Changes in the income and asset status of the older population in the past decade impact on the need for assistance with asset management and financial planning in, and for older age. Using primary data from a national survey of 3,434 respondents, and 100 in depth interviews regarding asset management, this paper identifies the extent to which management of income and assets by and on behalf of older people is a significant challenge to families and social institutions. It identifies the assumptions and expectations about the rights of older people in relationship to financial management, the problems arising for family asset managers and emergent issues in public policy regarding incomes policy and economic management in retirement. The reduction in supply of hospital and residential care places in Australia over the past 15. years, relative to population, is well recognised. The interdependence of hospitals, residential care and community care services in the care of frail and disabled older people demands an understanding of the provision of services not only at a national and a state level, but also at a regional level.

Road safety and continuation of driving is increasingly becoming a priority issue for Australians, particularly as the rate of individuals entering the older age group is progressively rising. A uniform national approach to licence renewal based on evidence-based assessment is being discussed by the Commonwealth and State governments as one approach towards meeting the needs of the community and older adults. The purpose of this paper is to explore the issues that may arise in the transition to a new system. Thirty-nine adults over the ages of 70 years old were interviewed. Half the participants were drivers with the remaining having ceased driving within two years of the interviews. In addition, half of the participants were residents within metropolitan areas in Brisbane, with the remaining residing in rural towns in Queensland. The results highlight the current lack of significant interaction between older drivers, their family, doctors and transport officials regarding driving assessment issues. In order to introduce an interactive system, considerable work will need to be done in order to actively engage older drivers in the process.",

Our subsequent research explored the stereotypes that are held about older workers. Negative stereotyping of older workers compared to younger workers was clearly identified and the stereotyping of older workers and intentions to hire them were significantly correlated. The current research reports on three interventions that were developed in order to promote positive attitude change toward older workers. Two hundred and sixty-seven randomly selected hiring decision-makers across industries from the private sector and 97 undergraduate students participated in a study that tested three interventions that were aimed at promoting positive attitude changes toward older workers and increasing the likelihood of their hiring. One intervention was a fact sheet (FS). one was aimed at inducing cognitive dissonance (CD) and the third was a CDFS combination. The results showed significant effects among hiring decision-makers but not undergraduate students. Hiring decision-makers in the CDFS condition had significantly more positive attitudes toward older workers overall compared with no intervention controls. Further, this group indicated that they were significantly more likely than controls to hire older workers and endorsed positive attitudes toward older workers in areas that are important in hiring, such as adaptability and trainability. T h e CDFS intervention demonstrated empirically that the combination of a cognitive dissonance-based and an information-based intervention was effective at promoting positive attitude changes toward older workers among hiring decision-makers and increasing the reported likelihood of hiring older workers. This paper addresses the findings of a bachelor of nursing honours research project which investigated the experience of registered nurses who utilise the Resident Classification Scale (RCS), the key instrument which links funding to the assessed need of residents in aged care facilities. The project is significant because there is little literature or research, which addresses the application of this instrument in the field or its implications for aged care nurses' practice.",

The implications of this for their identity as aged care nurses, and in relation to the recruitment and retention of nurses in the sector, are briefly explored. The paper concludes with a brief outline of strategies identified by the nurses to address these concerns. This quantitative, quasi-experimental pilot study investigated how environmental factors affect the mealtime behaviours of elderly people with dementia in a dementia specific unit of an aged care facility. Consistent with the method, this study involved the development of a tool, which objectively measures these effects. The findings of this study indicate that the environment does indeed impact on the mealtime behaviours of those with dementia in an institutional context. The environmental variable of noise was the one factor, which affected the mealtime behaviours of those with dementia most significantly throughout the conduction of this study. During this study, increased environmental stimuli were found to affect participants by reducing their ability to perform the various steps associated with eating. Increased environmental stimuli were also identified as a trigger to aggressivelagitated episodes. The paper concludes with recommendations for further study in this important area.",

            "text": "Within Australia aged care has undergone significant change over the past twenty years. These changes have had implications for the way that nurses' practice is structured within the sector. A key concern Australasian Journal on Ageing Volume 22.4 Supplement 1 is that RNs now have limited involvement in the provision of care to residents. Rather, it appears that it is unregulated workers who provide the majority of care. Surprisingly, there is a gap in the literature, which addresses how these two groups work together in the provision of resident care and, of primary concern to this study, how information regarding resident care is transferred from unregulated workers to RNs. Given this gap, this bachelor of Nursing (Hons) research study employed a critical research method to give four aged care nurses an opportunity to explore this issue. Each nurse participated in an interview, transcripts of which were then analysed and developed into a 'discussion paper'. Consistent with the collaborative intent of the methodology, the discussion paper was then given back to the participants for consideration prior to their meeting together within the context of a focus group discussion. This gave them an opportunity to further reflect on, and develop the analysis of, the issues raised in the paper. The findings revealed a division of labour in residential aged care, which saw RNs completing technical nursing care and unregulated workers being given responsibility for the provision of personal care to residents. The nurses' accounts indicate that such a division had many implications for the relationships they formed with unregulated workers and, subsequently, the transfer of resident care information. They suggest that the processes utilised to support the transfer of resident care information from unregulated workers to RNs were ad-hoc. The nurses identified that such ad-hoc processes had many implications in the provision of quality care to residents. Of particular concern were issues surrounding timing, quality and the appropriateness of information transferred and the impact of inconsistent 'carer' training on their ability to effectively assess resident needs.",

The assessment takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and requires minimal equipment.

The Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS) is a tool designed in the UK to assess the extent to which clients feel they have received enough information about prescribed medicines. Data collected can provide a \"medicine information profile, a total satisfaction rating, and subscales of \"action and usage\" (AU) and \"potential problems of medication\" (PPM). Recent applications of this tool with a frail older Australian population have resulted in minor revisions to maximise its utility as a component of examining and monitoring educational interventions around medication management. This paper presents a revised SIMS and data from the evaluation of the Bundoora Extended Care Centre .Australasian Journal on Ageing Volume 22.1 Supplement 1 Client Oriented Medication Program. The paper will examine the utility of SIMS in evaluating medication management education interventions with a frail older Australian population and as an ongoing quality assurance tool.",

            "text": "Several large surveys of older adults including the ABS National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, have reported that depression is less prevalent (around 2%) at this stage than at any other stage in the life span. These findings are contrary to recent results found by Silver Chain (Western Australian Home Care Agency) after the assessment of 4,996 individuals referred for home care using the Yale Depression Screen (YDSa single item screening question asking if the client has often felt depressed over the last four weeks). We found that 63% screened positively for depression and 41% reported feeling lonely. This suggests that the prevalence of depression in certain sub-populations of elderly (eg those receiving home care) may be considerably higher then the prevalence in the general aged population. Prior to developing and testing a model for home care that identifies depressed and lonely individuals and responds appropriately to their needs, it was essential to validate the above finding. Subsequently we compared (N=200) participants' responses on the YDS with face-to-face interviews administering the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Duke Social Support Index (DSSI). To rule out that the depression upon entry to home care is transient we are also completing follow up interviews at three months. This paper will discuss the results of this study and the future directions of this research. Staff caring for the frail aged'are challenged to find comprehensive, valid, and reliable symptom assessment tools. We trialed the Symptom Assessment Scale*, a tool used in the palliative care arena, with aged care residents able to supply selfreports. We administered the items, which assess symptom distress caused by nausea; insomnia; fatigue; breathing, bowel, and appetite problems; and pain to 46 hostel residents, three times daily for five days, establishing the tool's reliability and validity. Based upon findings, we deleted items measuring nausea and appetite problems and added one measuring bladder problems, then trialed the revised tool with 49 hostel residents, daily, for five days. In this trial, participants were encouraged to complete the tool entirely unassisted, the proportion able to achieve this ranging from 19.6% to 35.4%. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for this scale ranged from 0.50 to 0.64. Test re-test Intraclass Correlation Coefficients from Day 1 to Day 2 ranged from 0.62 to 0.74 in the case of pain, fatigue, and breathing problems, but were 0.19, 0.27, and 0.46 respectively for bladder problems, insomnia, and bowel problems. Satisfactory concurrent validity was demonstrated with an established measure of well-being. Although the revised tool's stability over time requires additional investigation, it has the potential to provide aged care staff with a quick and valid overview of symptom status in residents able to provide self-reports. Many older Australians feel uncomfortable using the telephone. Chances are this is because they may not hear very well, as one in two people over 60 has a hearing loss. Perhaps they may have difficulty being understood by others. For them the standard telephone is one of the most inaccessible pieces of equipment and making a telephone call becomes a nightmare. How would you manage your life without access to the telephone? Without appropriate telecommunication access we are denied the opportunity to participate in life in an equal way. It is easy to become isolated from family, friends and society. Fortunately, this need not be the case. More and more Australians are discovering an easy way to participate in a telephone conversation regardless of hearing or speech difficulties, restoring independence and accessibility into their lives. Australia's equitybased National Relay Service (NRS) is changing people's lives in ways they never thought possible, bridging the communication gap and bringing people together under terms and conditions that are similar to those that other Australians enjoy. You can say goodbye to difficult calls and hello to a new way of communicating with the NRS. This paper discusses how and what it has meant for some of our older citizens.",

In both institutional care and home care, the use of migrant labour is common and voluntary labour supplements much of the care provided by paid labour. However the cost of care on the open market remains beyond the means of most of the elderly and tax-supported care is scarce and rationed. Health bestrides the private and public sectors and in the latter, neo-liberalist ethos has lead to governments seeking to cap public spending, reduce taxes and privatise services from which profits can be made. Contractualism is part of neo-liberalism and is the basis of newer community care policies and these strengthen autonomy for those in need of care, those such as the ailing aged, but scarcity and the rationing process undermine such benefits. In many other countries guest workers provide care labour and reduce its scarcity.",

Recommendations on how to establish a rapport with research participants to ensure effective data collection will also be discussed. This will provide guidance for future qualitative research aimed at drawing rich descriptive data through the use of in-depth interviewing practices, particularly those involving ageing populations. Older people who are considered frail are sometimes regarded as a difficult client group to interview. As a result, their views and perspectives are often excluded or overlooked in both research and quality assurance activities. While there is considerable information about interviewing in general, there is very little information regarding effective interviewing, techniques that recognise issues specific to this particular client group. This paper looks at gaining meaningful information in a structured or semi-structured interview process from the perspective of the researcher and how this in turn can make it a satisfying experience for the older person. Practical experience gained in both community and institutional settings using a variety of methods is explored. Methods include face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and the use of interpreters for CALD client interviews.

The emerging understanding of the need to extend working life beyond current retirement ages is recognised as a core strategy to offset the potential costs of ageing on welfare and health budgets. As critical is the retention of workers to boost labour supply levels as supply tightens over coming decades. When developing approaches to extending working life the influences of retirement behaviour must be considered. This paper is based on research undertaken in a large Australian company over the past three years. The project explored factors that contributed to retirement decisions and assessed the level and range of planning undertaken by individuals in preparation for retirement. The research also considered retirement in the context of the life continuum, in particular the influence of age on skill Australian Association of Gerontology 36th National C o n f e r e n c e A b s t r a c t s development employment mobility and marketability. I t finds there is a complex interplay between a person's life situation, financial position and employment experience and opportunities that influence their retirement outlook. Against a background of population ageing, concerns about the high costs of early retirement and labour shortages among some industrialised nations, policy makers are increasingly emphasising the need to extend work life, support older workers to stay in work or to find a job, and to tackle age discrimination in the labour market. This paper is based on recent research which examined developments in public policies towards older workers in a number of countries: Australia, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the USA. It is noted that the trend towards early retirement and lower employment rates among older workers have a complex set of causes and that public policy efforts so far have often made little impact on the problem. Deficiencies are related to mono-causal understandings of the phenomenon and the fragmentation of policies. Consequently, the paper argues that only through an integrated and coordinated approach aimed at stimulating the social partners and individual workers to change their behaviour will public policies be able to make a sufficient impact on the employment rates and retirement patterns of older workers. Crucial to the degree of success will be the ability of policy makers to make policies sufficiently sensitive to the specific needs of both different groups of workers and employers.",

Objective: To determine if cGMP has protective effects in NG 108-15 (cholinergic-neuron-like) cells exposed to excess NO, and if basal cGMP levels are needed to protect against onset of apoptosis. Method: Apoptotic cells were quantified by TUNEL. Results: Cell death caused by SNAP and ODQ treatments was associated with apoptotic DNA fragmentation. SNAP at 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 2.0 mM caused significant (p<0.05) increases in the percentage of TUNEL labeled cells from a control of 0.90 to 6.19%, 6.36%, 7.25%, and 15.1% respectively. ODQ at 40 mM caused noticeable apoptotic DNA fragmentation, suggesting that even basal levels of cGMP may be important for protecting neural cells against onset of apoptosis. Pre-incubation of ANP with SNAP-and ODQ-treated cells decreased the apoptotic cell death. Conclusions: The data suggest that low basal levels of cGMP may protect cells against apoptosis and that elevated levels of cGMP in the presence of added NO may serve as an important counter-balance to the toxic actions of NO. This neuroprotective mechanism may be especially important in protecting against the development of neurodegenerative diseases encountered in the ageing process, such as Alzheimer's disease, HIV dementia and Parkinson's disease, in which excess NO is thought to contribute to the neuronal apoptosis.",

This project, therefore, developed a measure of interpersonal dependency for use with older adults and evaluated it in a home-care service setting. The following questions were answered in the process: 1) Are older people who access homecare services higher in their levels of interpersonal dependency than older people who do not access home-care services? 2) What is the relationship among interpersonal dependency, depression and physical dependency in an older home-care population? The 15 participants for item selection focus group sessions and a scale pilot study included 14 women and I man aged over 65 years from Perth metropolitan day centres and also three allied health professionals. Participants for scale reliability and validity studies included 703 older adults (aged over 65 years). Two hundred and fifty-two were Silver Chain Nursing Association clients, 358 were Positive Ageing Foundation members and 9 3 were members of the Council on the Ageing. A reliable and valid 20-item interpersonal dependency measure for use with older adults resulted from the development process. In addition a comparative study utilizing the new measure found that older adults in the home-care service population scored higher on the measure of interpersonal dependency than older adults sampled from the other populations. A hierarchical regression analysis found that both interpersonal dependency and depression were significant predictors of mobility in older adults. These findings have important intervention and financial implications for service providers. Screening for interpersonal dependency in older adults could assist in designing interventions that are more attuned to individual's needs and thus reduce reliance on services.",

Ms Margaret Brown, Hawke Institute. Universio of South Australia, SA. Ms Eileen Willis, Flinders University of South Austrulia, SA. Email: Margaret.Brown@unisa.edu.au Research suggests that the development of a simple and practical tool for advance care planning is essential to ensure that all residents have their wishes respected when dying in an aged care facility. A study funded with a NHMRC grant examined Palliative Care In Aged Care Facilities For Residents With A Non-Cancer Diagnosis.Data was collected in two stages, 1) from a representative sample of residential aged care facilities in South Australia and 2) from 69 residents who participated over a 10 week period in a more in depth prospective data collection to ascertain palliative care needs and services. Fifteen care directors were interviewed about current palliative care policies and procedures in the facility.There has been little research investigating the use of advance directives or the process of 'advance care planning' even though the Standards for Aged Care recognizes the importance of identifying and respecting the resident's wishes about their terminal care. However, the standards do not indicate how these wishes might be identified and recorded on admission to a facility especially if the resident is no longer competent. This research noted that the Aged Care Facilities had developed forms to record the resident's wishes about their care but there was no consistency in the content or the use of terminology across the facilities. Nor was there consistent information about the legal advance directive forms available in South Australia. Not all facilities had a palliative care policy to guide the process of advance care planning.53. End-of-Life Choices in ResidentialAged Care Will I have to go to hospital to die? Who will make decisions about my care? Will my fears and concerns be listened to? Will my family have a say in what happens to me? Will I be in pain? Can I change my mind about the kind of care I want? Can I choose who will be with me at the end? These questions may arise as a person enters an aged care facility, the questions becoming more urgent as death approaches and more complex for those with dementia. Families may also have questions about quality of life, dignified death, resuscitation, invasive medical treatment, and their role in care planning. Drawing from the guidelines being developed by the Australian Palliative Aged Care (APAC) project (Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing)it will be shown that the unique and diverse needs of people in residential aged care require an approach that considers their specific situation and allows for options, flexibility and review as changes occur. The guidelines, derived from the best available evidence, emphasise the need to educate and empower aged care workers to consider alternatives to the unnecessary hospitalisation of dying residents.Through a dynamic partnership with their families and caregivers, residents can participate in advanced decision-making that respects their wishes. Rather than believing they have come to the end of life's choices, people in residential aged care can be offered empowering and liberating alternatives, through realistic and achievable end-of-life choices. 54.

To thereby determine what factors characterise these admissions and identify system issues and failures that lead to unplanned admission. To determine system measures that might be implemented to reduce the need for unplanned admission.Method:Detailed information was gathered about 100 patients, aged 75 years and over, living at home or in a hostel, and admitted through the emergency department over a 12 month period. Interviews of patients, carers, and health care personnel were undertaken including clinical file reviews. The interviews were carried out by a Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) in Community Aged Care. Questionaries were sent to general practitioners. Qualitative analysis of the data obtained was undertaken by the CNC and a specialist geriatrician. The analysis process, and conclusions arising from that analysis, were validated by an expert panel in 10 randomly selected cases from the 100 study patients.Results: Detailed demographic, historical, social and functional data. was obtained for all the study patients. General practitioner information was obtained through questionnaire returns in 62 cases. In 79 cases the research analysis concluded that there existed opportunities for earlier alternative intervention that may have obviated the need for unplanned emergency admission. In 18 of these cases elective, planned admission may have been a suitable alternative. Recumng themes were identified that categorised missed opportunities for alternative intervention.Conclusions: Unplanned admissions of older people through the emergency department are a suboptimal way of resolving the chronic health care needs of older people. At the same time they compromise effective management of hospital resources. In a very significant number of cases (79 of 100) in this study alternative measures and opportunities were identified that may have prevented the unplanned admission. Many of the cases comprised older people with chronic or subacute illness that would be amenable to alternative measures. There is a need to develop systems of care that can identify and meet the needs of this group of patients.106. Bridging the Gap: Continuity of care inrehabilitationEmail: b.dow @nari.unimelb.edu.au    Over the past 10 years, there has been a national and international trend towards home care as a substitute for hospital care. With the introduction of homebased rehabilitation, inpatient lengths of stay have reduced as clients can now go home to participate in rehabilitation at an earlier stage of care. The transition between hospital and home is often occurring when the client is still physically vulnerable and may be requiring high level care. Maintaining good links between hospital and home is therefore critical for the client's safety and for best practice in rehabilitation.This paper draws on two studiesan evaluation of home-based rehabilitation currently being undertaken by the National Ageing Research Institute on behalf of the Department of Human Services in Victoria and the doctoral research of one of the authors. It presents the perspectives of clients, carers, and staff from both inpatient and home-based rehabilitation about the rehabilitation continuum. Based on analysis of interviews, surveys and focus groups, some of the barriers and enablers associated with bridging the gap between hospital and home are discussed.Features of good practice included : -Inclusion of the client and carer in discharge planning and care plan development Providing feedback on referrals Minimising time lags between one service and the next Providing opportunities for continuity of care; and Providing a physical environment that facilitates networking opportunities.",

The service is based within the hospital Emergency Department (ED) and has been of particular relevance to older people.

In-Depth Interviews with Ageing Men -Learning from past health researchMr James Smith, University ofSouth Australia, SA. Dr Murray Drummond, University ofSourh Australia, SA Email: james.smith@postgrads.unisa.edu.auIt has been argued that men are reluctant to talk about issues concerning their health(DHS, 2000). Further, such hesitation is particularly prevalent in older males(Zinn, 2002). However, a range of factors can contribute to the openness and willingness of ageing men to participate in research. These are pertinent when utilising in-depth interview techniques to investigate personal health issues, such as those related to nutrition. To overcome limitations that exist with regard to how ageing men divulge personal information throughout in-depth interviews, one must investigate existing barriers.",

Interpersonal Dependency in Older Adults: Development of a Measure and its Evaluation in Health Care Services Ms Deborah Gardner, Edith Cowan University, WA. Email: dkgardne@student.ecu.edu.au Increasing dependency in older age is conceptualised differently by various disciplines. Psychologists have contributed to our understanding of dependency in older age by describing and explaining the functionality of dependency across the life-span. Psychological research has also examined variables (such as the responses of carers to the dependent behaviours of older people) that exacerbate dependent feelings and behaviours (Baltes., 1996), but it has not included an individual difference measure of interpersonal dependency.

This paper will describe and evaluate the development of a TNH involving three nursing homes which are located geographically close to each other in collaboration with ACU. Continuing meetings have been held with the Directors of Nursing and a Nurse Educator from the NHs and staff from ACU to provide planned clinical experiences for undergraduate students. Clinical (aged and palliative care), professional skills and assessments for the placement have been developed at meetings of NH and university staff. A research grant allowed evaluation of the experience and examined if students' attitudes towards working with older adults generally and working with older adults in long-term care improved as a result of this experience.",

Impairment in memory functions is among the early signs of Alzheimer disease and neuropsychological assessment of memory functions can often detect the early signs of impaired memory. In recent years, computerized assessment of many cognitive functions has been developed, including the assessment of memory functions. Here we contrast the performance of 33 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 71.2 years, SD = 7.62) on Microcog, one of the first commercial computerbased assessment instruments intended for use with older adults, with a standard, widely-used measure, the third edition of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-111). Participants were screened for possible depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale, and completed both memory tests in counter-balanced order. WMS-I11 General Memory correlated .53 with the MicroCog Memory Index and .52 with the General Cognitive Functional Index. Correlations between the visual memory measures of the two tests were not statistically significant. Using criteria from each test's manual, the participants were classified as lying within the Average or Above Average ranges. The resulting cross-classification gave a value of Cohen's kappa of .38, with 33% of participants classified differently by the two tests. We conclude that the correspondence between the two measures is not sufficient to substitute one for the other for clinical decision making as to the memory functioning of older adults. This poster will address specifically how the Aged Care Consultation Service (ACCS) has improved the quality of aged care interventions, treatment and discharge planning. The challenges for this service have been to provide holistic assessments and consultations, and treatment of these patients within the acute setting. Commencement of an early treatment program aims to avoid functional decline and reduce hospital length of stay.",

The aim of the groups is first of all to help participants to cope more effectively with the emotional demands of living with dementia, and secondly to evaluate the changes that occur. Levels of anxiety and depression and cooing style were assessed at regular intervals, before, during and after the groups had ended. Selected group sessions were videotaped to allow a qualitative analysis of group processes and patterns of individual change.The findings suggest that people in the early stages of dementia can benefit significantly from support group intervention.

Focus groups and individual discussions have been held with medical staff regarding the frequency and type of assessment and management of medications for each Residentand this haws been incorporated into the protocol for Resident management in each facility.A 25% reduction of falls in the high risk, frail resident population is projected, over a 12 month period. Bundoora Extended Care Centre (BECC), a sub acute facility in Melbourne, identified the need to address issues relating to the safe and appropriate management of medications once discharged home from hospital by clients and their carers. As part of the National Demonstration Hospital Program -Stage 4, BECC developed a Client Orientated Medication System (COMS). As the effectiveness of an individualised education program for older clients has been demonstrated by research over time, the COMS included a suite of interventions that focus on educating frail elderly clients/carers to better manage their medication at home. In particular, the benefits of implementing the clinical pharmacy role were recognised in the development of COMS. This poster demonstrates the role of the hospital pharmacist as part of a multidisciplinary team in a Client Oriented Medication System in the sub-acute setting. It will illustrate the importance of pharmacy-client communication throughout the process and presents information on components such as the educational role including academic detailing with clients and the preparation and dissemination of information for discharge that best addresses the needs of frail older people and those who care for them in the community.
