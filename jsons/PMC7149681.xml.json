Boys are more susceptible than girls (male:female preponderance of 1.4:1).2 Croup season peaks in late autumn (September to December), which closely correlates with the prevalence of parainfluenza virus infection in the community, and also occurs in winter, with a strong seasonality pattern.4 There is often a smaller spring peak. Episodes are usually self-limiting and are influenced by weather conditions.",

This is usually easily diagnosed by an asymmetry of the tonsillar pillars. The affected side is asymmetrically enlarged and protrudes anteriorly into the mouth. Many other agents may be indistinguishable clinically from streptococcal pharyngitis (Box 25-2\n). Coxsackieviruses often cause ulcers in the posterior pharynx along with a sore throat. Measles can cause a severe pharyngitis, but the associated symptoms of conjunctivitis, rash and Koplik's spots make the disease easily diagnosable. Parainfluenza and influenza viruses can give a painful pharyngitis, with frequently associated symptoms of cough and laryngitis. EBV, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and HSV can produce significant pharyngitis. They also tend to last longer than the other viral causes of pharyngitis. These viruses produce other upper respiratory symptoms such as nontender cervical adenopathy, or in the case of HSV, tongue and mouth ulcers. HSV pharyngitis has been described as a disease in which \u2018the gums swell up and swallow the teeth\u2019 (Figure 25-6\n). Acute HIV infection (\u2018seroconversion illness\u2019) may cause symptoms in up to 50% of patients. It is a mononucleosis-like illness in which pharyngitis is a prominent feature (see Chapter 93). Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes diphtheria, which is easily diagnosed because of the gray pseudomembrane in the posterior pharynx along with pharyngitis (Figure 25-7\n). Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a common cause of pharyngitis and can also cause a scarlatiniform rash. It is a cause of many non-GAS throat infections.34\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is an important cause of pharyngitis in sexually active individuals. The appearance of the pharyngitis is nondiagnostic, so a heightened awareness is required to make this diagnosis35 (see Chapter 65). Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause pharyngitis, but generally will progress to cough also, often with wheezing and pneumonia.36\nCandida albicans can cause pharyngitis but normally only in the immunocompromised host.
