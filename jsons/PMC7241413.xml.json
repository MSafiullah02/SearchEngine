            "text": "Coronaviruses are new viruses. Although there have been many timely discoveries for this virus, there are still many things unknown [1,3]. I designed a novel tool named the DNA nucleotide footprint plotter. It can distinguish different types of viruses such as Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-Cov virus, HIV virus, and influenza virus, as indicated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n. It was also used to compare the complete sequence of COVID-19 corona strain with OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS-CoV (Fig. 5\n) as well as different subtypes of corona viruses (Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16). The characteristics of hundreds of virus genomes and gene segments have been displayed by DNA footprint plotter (data not all shown). This application has the capability to display the exact changes that occur in nucleotide position of nonstructural and structural regions of the novel different complete genome of COVID-19 corona strains (Fig. 6). Even if the method is designed to observe structural changes at the genomic level that single nucleotide polymorphism calling tools cannot identify, it is possible to show genotype changes and amino acid changes at a single nucleotide resolution. In addition, DNA footprint plotter is a useful tool to determine the evidence of recombination. A recombination between Corona virus MT121215 and Influenzavirus HC668016 was simulated by making a FASTA file containing the beginning of the flu genome and the end of the corona virus genome. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, the simulated recombination created a chimera of partial flu virus and partial corona virus.",

However, the tool can precisely demonstrate single nucleotide information (Fig. 6). The method itself has no limit to plot the number of nucleotide bases. But due to the size of computer screens and paper, too many bases will cause the lines to overlay each other. Thus the sizes of virus genome or segments of eukaryote genome are recommended for one particular plot. One plot can display a complete virus genome, and users can combine multiple plots together to visualize more complicated genomes such as the genomes of eukaryotes. Or if only a partial virus genome or a particular gene are of interest, the corresponding regions can be displayed by DNA foot plotter.",
