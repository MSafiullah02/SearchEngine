Broadly speaking, responses to an epidemic fall into two categories: coordinated and uncoordinated. Coordinated responses include vaccination and quarantine schemes, travel restrictions, and information spread through mass media. Uncoordinated responses cover individuals adapting their behavior based on their own perceived risk; this includes improved hygiene regimens and avoiding crowded places and public transport during outbreaks. Surveys consistently identify such precautionary measures taken by individuals during epidemic outbreaks [2, 3] . Fear of becoming infected during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong caused huge behavioral shifts; air travel into Hong Kong dropped by as much as 80% [4] . Responses to a large study covering numerous European and Asian regions revealed that, in the event of an influenza pandemic, 75% of people would avoid public transport, and 20-30% would try to stay indoors [5] . These behavioral shifts change the potential routes for transmission and can alter the size and time scale of an epidemic [6] .",

Gross et al. [8, 9] considered a simple susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) model with rewiring, in which susceptible nodes disconnect from infected neighbors at rate \u03c9, and immediately reconnect to a randomly chosen susceptible node. This simple model led to bistability and to oscillatory solutions, albeit with oscillations limited to an extremely narrow region of the parameter space. This rewiring procedure has since been extended to consider scenarios where both the susceptible and * k.blyuss@sussex.ac.uk infected nodes can rewire, and diseases with a latent period [10] . Zhang et al. [11] presented a further alternative, where news about past prevalence influences whether nodes choose to disconnect edges. The authors found an estimate of the critical delay that induces a Hopf bifurcation, thus causing periodicity. Tunc et al. [12] studied a network model with temporary deactivation of edges between susceptible and infected individuals. On a growing network, Zhou et al. [13] showed that cutting links between susceptible and infected individuals can lead to epidemic reemergence, with long periods of low disease prevalence punctuated by large outbreaks.",

A number of models have identified other possible causes of periodicity in epidemic dynamics. To give one example, Hethcote et al.

Incidence reports of mycoplasma pneumonia have found evidence of epidemic cycles in many different countries, with periodicity of three to five years [20, 21] . Recently, it has been suggested that syphilis exhibits periodic cycling [22] , although these findings have been subsequently questioned [23] .

If an individual is aware of the state of their neighbors and responds accordingly, then times of high prevalence will be associated with greater caution, curbing further spread. Conversely, without advance warning, behavior will return to normal as prevalence wanes, enabling a second wave of the epidemic. Despite this intuition, adaptive network models have so far not been able to show such robust oscillations over reasonable regions of the parameter space. To tackle this problem, we introduce a simple SIS model on an adaptive network with N nodes. Infected nodes transmit the disease to susceptible neighbors at rate \u03b2 across links, and recover and become susceptible again at rate \u03b3 , independently of the network. Susceptible nodes cut links that connect them to infected neighbours at rate \u03c9 and, after a fixed time delay of length \u03c4 , reconnect to susceptible nodes chosen uniformly at random from all such available nodes. The delay between cutting and reconnecting is crucial. It is unrealistic to expect that alternative contacts can be identified and established arbitrarily quickly. The delay represents both people's hesitance to make new contacts and also the potential lack of availability of such new contacts when an epidemic is spreading thorough a population [5] .",

The delay before an S-I edge is rewired to an S-S edge introduces a complication, as not all newly formed edges will be between two susceptible nodes. To see this, consider an example of a susceptible node with two or more infected neighbors. At some time t 1 it disconnects from one of these neighbors. Then, in the interval (t 1 ,t 1 + \u03c4 ) another infected neighbor transmits the disease to it. If it then remains infected until time t 1 + \u03c4 , the new edge will be of an I -S type rather than S-S. To deal with this issue we use a technique similar to that used by Kiss et al. [27] for a pairwise model with an infectious period of fixed length. Consider y p (t) to be the cohort of susceptible nodes that have cut a link at time t \u2212 \u03c4 and are waiting to reconnect.

Using this result in the numerical linear stability analysis of (4) allows us to analyze the stability of the endemic equilibrium. As shown in Fig. 2(a) , changes to both \u03c4 and \u03c9 are capable of destabilizing the endemic equilibrium. Regardless of the value of \u03c4 , eventually high values of the rewiring rate make the DFE stable again. For most values of \u03c4 this coincides with the point where the endemic steady state becomes biologically infeasible (less than or equal to zero), leaving the DFE as the only plausible steady state for the system. However, for sufficiently small values of \u03c4 , the endemic steady state remains feasible, and there is a small region of bistability. Qualitatively, this behavior is the same for any choice of the other parameters, as long as the endemic steady state remains biologically feasible, as illustrated for Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 2(a) .

If the value of \u03c4 is large enough, then after a certain time the number of edges in the network is small enough to effectively starve the disease of transmission routes, and prevalence falls. These edges are then redrawn at the same rate as they were cut \u03c4 time ago, and k(t) grows, which allows the disease to spread again. Figure 2 (d) illustrates this behavior both in simulation and in the meanfield model (4) , showing how after the initial outbreak each new wave of infection is preceded by the recovery of network connectivity. The effect of oscillatory interactions between network connectivity and the propagating disease may be more pronounced in network simulations. Gross et al. [8] found that adaptive rewiring without delay can lead to the formation of highly connected clusters of susceptible nodes that are vulnerable to disease once any one node becomes infected. Since the model (4) does not account for changes in network structure, i.e., the closure is the same for all times and it does not depend on the average degree or degree distribution, this can potentially explain the small discrepancy between the solution of the deterministic and simulation models observed in Fig. 1 .",

Time snapshots of several large networks in Fig. 4 show the evolution of the degree distribution at various key points of an epidemic in an oscillatory regime. The initial network topology (black solid lines) is quickly reorganized to a peaked distribution. The oscillations in prevalence cause slight but repeated changes in the degree distribution. Unsurprisingly, when prevalence is at or near its peak, nodes with a lower degree are more common. When the prevalence falls, the distribution curves shift to the right, and the shape of the distribution flattens slightly. When the endemic steady state is stable, the degree distribution stabilizes to a peaked distribution between the two extremes of the oscillatory regime. A very important observation is that, irrespective of the initial network topology, due to rewiring different networks eventually settle on a very similar skewed degree distribution. This implies that earlier conclusions derived for the specific closure (1) appropriate for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs are actually applicable to modeling long-term dynamics of different types of networks, for which the influence of the initial topology is low since a significant amount of rewiring has already taken place.",

It would be of great value to examine a similar situation under delayed rewiring, with time delay representing the time for which infected nodes partially isolate themselves before rewiring, in accordance with advice given by public health authorities. This would alter the nature of the variable x(t) in the model. For example, if only infected nodes rewire, x(t) \u2248 e \u2212\u03b3 \u03c4 . Preliminary tests of this rewiring scheme show behavior similar to the present model.",

            "text": "Numerical simulations have shown that a similar oscillatory behavior is observed for other initial network topologies, including scale-free networks. Furthermore, since rewiring nodes choose their new neighbors uniformly at random from all available susceptible nodes, the initial network topology itself is transient, as shown in Fig. 4 , and, as a result, over time our model becomes more relevant. Future work will look at how the degree distribution and oscillations are affected in the case when the network links are rewired not randomly but according to a preferential attachment or some fitness-based rule. This could result in some interesting new dynamics due to the competition between the increased probability of highly connected nodes receiving new links, and the increased probability of infection.",
