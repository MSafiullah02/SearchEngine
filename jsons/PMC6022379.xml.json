The sequences of the selected primers were compared to an alignment of the E gene sequences of 14 strains of WNV. The details of the oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the E gene of WNV are given in Table II. The real-time monitoring of RT-LAMP assay was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63\u00b0C for 60 min in Loopamp Real-time Turbidimeter (LA-200, Teramecs, Japan). Positive and negative controls were included in each experiment. The real-time monitoring of RT-LAMP amplification of WNV template was observed through spectrophotometric analysis by recording optical density (OD) at 400 nm at every six seconds with the help of Loopamp Real-Time Turbidimeter (LA-200, Teramecs, Japan). The cut-off value for positivity by real-time RT-LAMP assay was determined by taking into account the time of positivity (Tp; in min) at which the turbidity increased above the threshold value fixed at 0.1, which was two times more than average turbidity value of the negative controls of several replicates. Therefore, a sample having Tp values of \u226445 min and turbidity above the threshold value of \u22650.1 was considered positive. To facilitate the field application of RT-LAMP assay, the observance for amplification was also performed through colour change by addition of 1 \u03bcl of SYBR Green I dye to the tube. In case of positive amplification, the original orange colour of the dye will change into green that can be seen under natural light as well as under ultraviolet (UV) light (302 nm) with the help of a hand-held UV torch lamp. In case there is no amplification, the original orange colour of the dye will be retained.",

The applicability of RT-LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis of WNV was evaluated on 105 acute-phase serum samples from patients with ocular infection. The results were compared with conventional RT-PCR. A panel of 35 DEN- and 25 chikungunya-positive serum samples along with 10 negative acute-phase serum samples and 20 negative serum samples were used for comparative evaluation. Of the 105 samples, 27 were positive by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative OD values with different categories of sample panel are depicted in Fig. 2. All positive samples revealed a higher OD value of 0.2-0.6 as compared to 0.05 in the case of negative samples. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to conventional RT-PCR by picking up four additional positive cases which were missed by RT-PCR. No cross-reactivity was observed with DEN- and chikungunya-positive samples along with healthy serum samples, thus establishing the specificity of RT-LAMP assay.",

Several outbreaks in different countries with various range of severity have been reported earlier. A recent outbreak of WNV was seen in the United States. More than 1100 cases and at least 44 deaths have been reported24. During the past decade, various nucleic acid amplification techniques such as RT-PCR, TaqMan real-time RT-PCR, SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR and NASBA have been developed to address the need for rapid identification of WNV with accuracy. Despite the high magnitude of amplification, these PCR-based methods are costly and require trained personnel to perform assay. In addition, these methods are often cumbersome to adapt for routine clinical use, especially in peripheral healthcare settings and private clinics. Therefore, a rapid, specific, cost-effective and sensitive test is necessary for effective surveillance of new WNV circulating strains. Based on TaqMan chemistry, two real-time RT-PCR assay systems for the detection of WNV RNA genome in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissues samples from human, field-collected mosquitoes and avian tissue samples have been reported8.",

The higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP reaction are attributed to continuous amplification under isothermal condition employing six primers recognizing eight distinct regions of the target. Besides, the higher amplification efficiency RT-LAMP reaction yields large amount of by-product, pyrophosphate ion, leading to white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture.
