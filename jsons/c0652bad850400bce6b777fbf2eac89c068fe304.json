This would be recognised as result of the disease provoked by a new coronavirus able to infect humans and transmit within human populations. By January 23, Chinese authorities had taken severe measures to contain its spread: imposing travel bans, restricting mobility within Wuhan, isolating suspect and confirmed cases, banning gatherings and shutting schools and entertainment venues. This did not prevent the virus from reaching several other countries and all regions of China quickly. On January 30, with 7,711 confirmed cases in China and 83 in other countries, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (1, 2) Mexico confirmed its first cases of Covid-19 on February 27 in travellers returning from Italy to Sinaloa and Mexico City respectively. On March 15, the Mexican National Committee for Safety in Health (Comit\u00e9 Nacional para la Seguridad en Salud) announced the start, on March 23, of distancing measures to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, declaring the start of the second phase of the epidemic. Phase three would be declared nearly a month later, on April 21. Distancing measures included suspension of all non essential activities of public, private and social sectors, and was initially planned to last until April 30, but was later extended until May 17 or May 30, depending on the local situation of every municipality of the country. These measures were designed to lower disease incidence rates of COVID-19 and keep the number of hospitalized and critical cases manageable. (3, 4) There are important reasons to expect that the number of actual infected cases in Mexico City, and the country at large, are larger than the reported ones. The testing rate in Mexico is the lowest among the OECD countries (5) and the positivity rate for testing in Mexico City on the week ending on May 6, for example, ranges between 24.5% to 41.7% depending on the municipality (6) . Both of these factors imply a likely large sub-reporting of cases. The strain on the Health system is already important in Mexico City and other large population centers in the country. To the day of submission of this work, the model used by the Federal Government's General Directorate of Epidemiology (Direcci\u00f3n General de Epidemiolog\u00eda) has not been publicly released. There is no technical information available on the model's fundamental underlying (biological, statistical, mathematical) assumptions on contact rates, initial conditions, percentage of asymptomatic carriers, basic reproduction number among others. As far as we are aware of, there is only one peer-reviewed published model on the Mexican case but this is centered on the analysis of the",

Models are commonly used to estimate, for example, the extent of the reduction in the effective transmission rate needed to control an epidemic.

These are models that depend on a large number of parameters and for which, once fitted to limited or noisy data, a broad range of certain parameter values produce similarly acceptable fits. This is clearly disconcerting, since using different parameter estimates one will surely obtain widely different predictions from the same model, rendering its application to forecasting impractical, a problem which unfortunately is frequently overlooked at times when theoretical expectations and scientific rigour are directly needed.",

One way to tackle these uncertainties is to use a Bayesian approach and analyse whether the mitigation measures are being effective and what are the worst-case scenarios to be expected. Specifically, we introduce the predictive posterior distribution for epidemiological models. This allows us to analyse a full spectrum of scenarios, thus enabling us to determine whether the response is being appropriate in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Instead of accurately calibrating models with data, which is a difficult task to carry out from the short time series of the early stage of an epidemic, we focus on the effects of parameter variability in the model's predictions.",

Examples of simple epidemiological models are the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) or the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models, for which the states are N = (S, I, R) or N = (S, E, I, R), respectively. More realistic models, as the one we will use here, with the aim to estimate disease toll and burden, introduce additional states to follow hospitalized and critically-ill patients. Suppose now that we have an observational dataset D \u2261 {N (obs) (t)} tmax t=0 , possibly with an observational time-and compartmental-correlation matrix. From here we can derive the likelihood P (D|\u03b8) of observing this dataset given a set of parameters. Using Bayes' rule, the posterior distribution of the parameters given the dataset is simply P (\u03b8|D) \u221d P (D|\u03b8)P0(\u03b8) where P0(\u03b8) is the prior distribution of the parameters. The standard way to calibrate the model is to find the set of parameters, denoted here as \u03b8 , which maximizes the posterior distribution P (\u03b8|D), that is, \u03b8 = arg max \u03b8 P (\u03b8|D). These are sometimes referred to as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. When the prior distribution is flat, and the posterior distribution exists, \u03b8 coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator. Once the model has been calibrated using this point estimator, the evolution of the epidemic is given by N (t, \u03b8 ), which can then be used to make predictions.",

This set of plots are fairly informative and it is worth discussing them in detail. We first notice that by using the parameter's posterior distribution, the deterministic solution (indicated by a solid red line for each frame in the first row), the solutions spread fairly widely, with all possible epidemic curves encapsulated by the dashed black lines. Thus, the deterministic solution is very sensitive to parameter changes, which makes it unsuitable as a forecasting tool by itself. Secondly, the density plots show that certain epidemic curves tend to accumulate in specific (dark) regions. Interestingly enough, there is an increment in the density of curves symmetrically distributed D R A F T above and below the deterministic curve at the beginning of the epidemic. It turns out that the increased density above the red solid line corresponds to the epidemic that would have resulted if no contingency plan had been implemented. The latter is indicated by a solid dark green line only on the first plot. We thus conclude that the contingency plan was successful, albeit mildly, managing to flatten the curve and shift its peak to the right. Actually from the parameters' posterior distribution, one can show that prior the activation of the contingency plan, the basic reproduction rate R0 was 2.48, which was lowered to the value 2.03 once the plan was activated on March 23. Similarly, the increased density of curves below the deterministic line indicate what would have happened if the mitigation had been more successful. We finally observe that the deterministic curve for daily new critically-ill patients obtained is above the data, suggesting that we are overestimating the total toll for the number of deceased patients predicted by our analysis.",

Interestingly enough, the support of the distribution of times is compact, meaning that one could provide a rather hard and robust interval within which peak actually happens, admittedly rather large. We can also provide the mean date for the peak to occur. For instance the mean date for new infected cases is May 18, with a standard deviation of 17 days. One may argue that having a rather large standard deviation does not provide informative predictions for the peak of the epidemic.

In Mexico, several hundreds of Health Units constitute the country's sentinel surveillance system where cases are detected and followed to identify possible contacts of that case and other relevant information (14, 15) . A case detected by symptomatic surveillance has to be confirmed by testing, but, to obtain a concrete, workable estimation of the epidemic, tests must be widely applied to the general population, not only to suspect cases already detected by the surveillance system.",

            "text": "The positivity test rate for SARS-CoV-2 in the various municipalities of Mexico City was around 20%-40% on May 8, 2020 (6) . This high positivity rate and the limited number of tests currently performed may prevent obtaining an accurate estimate of both the epidemic size and the true growth rate of the epidemic including the determination of the days where the epidemic peak is occurring; in particular, identification of the time of maximum incidence may be confounded. Since tests are insufficient and, for the particular situation of the Mexican economy, increasing the testing rate is unfeasible, mathematical modeling projections can help to evaluate different scenarios that are consistent with the observed trend of the epidemic curve. Our model provides projections based on confirmed cases corrected for under-reporting that put the more likely dates of maximum incidence towards the end of May or early June, 2020. Earlier dates are possible, too, but with lower probability. These findings are important because lifting the Sanitary Emergency Measures, firstly implemented in late March in Mexico City, is programmed for May 30, 2020. If our scenarios are correct, the risk of a new outbreak is high, given that the date for ending confinement would coincide with the dates predicted to be of maximum incidence. Moreover, even D R A F T if maximum incidence occurs in early May 2020 and incidence decreases the following days, the number of susceptible individuals will still be large. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, there is yet no significant herd immunity in the population. In Mexico, April 30 (Children's day) and May 10 (Mother's day) are significant dates for family gatherings and celebrations. To the date of submission, the effect of these perturbations on the epidemic curve are yet unknown. However, our modelling approach allows for the consideration of these actions and the planning of mitigation or other intervention measures because of its probabilistic nature.",
