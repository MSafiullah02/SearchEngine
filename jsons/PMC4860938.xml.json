These include gloves, mouth mask, rubber dam and high volume evacuator (HVE).[3] Preprocedural rinse mainly chlorhexidine (CHX) in varying concentrations, (0.12% normally) are also being used to reduce the bacterial contamination before ultrasonic scaling and periodontal surgery.[4] Hence, it seemed prudent to evaluate the efficacy of simple and inexpensive methods such as CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse and HVE in reducing bacterial contamination in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling procedure in dental setup by assessing the colony forming units (CFUs) before and after their use.",

Before ultrasonic scaling procedure, the room was cleaned and fumigated with formaldehyde and potassium permanganate crystals for 2 days (48 h). Following fumigation, blood agar plates were kept for 10 min in the four corners and in the middle of the closed room to collect bioaerosol samples. After 10 min, agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h to allow for the growth of bacteria. Following this, the culture plates were assessed for CFUs using manual colony counting device. Fumigation was repeated until there was a substantial reduction in contaminated bioaerosols in the room. The dental chair was disinfected with surface disinfectant (bacilol-25) and instruments such as mouth mirror, probe, kidney tray and scaler tips were sterilized in the autoclave.",

Similarly, another study done using saliva samples showed that two consecutive 30s preprocedural rinsing with CHX (0.12%) had a profound effect on the bacterial flora of the oral cavity.[101112]",

The above results of our study are comparable with the findings of Harrel et al. who also found that HVE was effective in minimizing the bioaerosol contamination during ultrasonic scaling. The HVE used in dentistry has a large opening about 8 mm or greater and is attached to an evacuation system that helps to remove a large volume of air up to 100 cubic feet of air per minute.[1314] These characteristics of HVE could also be the possible reason why HVE has shown to reduce contamination caused from operating site by more than 90%.[151617] However, there are reports where only a narrow difference was observed when either HVE or conventional suction device (CDS) was used to reduce bioaerosol contamination.[1819]",

Unfortunately, many dental practitioners appear to use only the personal protection barrier as a single approach to reduce the risk of infection.[20] As we have observed in our study, a significant reduction in the CFUs when a combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used, we emphasize the need to use both CHX (0.12%) and HVE along with the personal protective barriers in routine dental infection control thereby minimizing any legal or regulatory risks that may exist in dental practice.[120]",
