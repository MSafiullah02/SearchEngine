During the following weeks the international medical community has witnessed with unprecedented coverage the public health response both domestically by the Chinese government, and on an international scale as cases have spread to dozens of countries. While much regarding the virus and the Chinese public health response is still unknown, national and public health institutions globally are preparing for a pandemic. As cases and spread of the virus grow, emergency and other front-line providers may become more anxious about the possibility of encountering a potential case. This review describes the tenets of a public health response to an infectious outbreak by using recent historical examples and also by characterizing what is known about the ongoing response to the COVID-19 outbreak.",

For example, the relatively low CFR rate (\u223c2% compared to >60% in Ebola Virus cases, >30% in MERS-CoV cases, and >9% in SARS-CoV cases) raises concerns for subclinical and unreported infections. 59 This restricts public health officials' ability to determine whether this ongoing Chinese epidemic (widespread disease transmission within a nation) has yet made the jump to a pandemic (widespread disease transmission occurring in multiple nations). Similarly, the competence of the Chinese CDC in identifying the outbreak and implementing rapid control measures is threatened by reports of \"narrative controlling\" preventing effective communication between frontline practitioners and the global outbreak response. 60 In an outbreak that seems to change hourly, a delay of days or weeks diminishes the responders' ability to truly assess the impact, transmissibility, extent of spread, and virulence of the disease. As such, much of the characterizations of COVID-19 should be understood as preliminary and subject to change as data becomes more readily available.",

Mimicking the rapid spread of the virus, the hourly expansion of misinformation on television, news reports, and social media have obscured the actual communication by international health authorities to medical professionals and the wider public. 3 While the health community mobilizes to contain the virus, emergency providers outside China have a duty to address the growing public fear with accepted principles of public health.

One of the most striking features of the current COVID-19 outbreak are the reports of detainment of journalists, threats to whistleblowers, punishment of government officials, and deletion of social media posts in apparent efforts to control the image of the outbreak. This has contributed to a widespread distrust of the communications by the Chinese government and public health officials reminiscent of the SARS epidemic.6",
