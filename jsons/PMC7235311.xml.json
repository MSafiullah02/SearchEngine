Such a service has been touted as being a useful, convenient, and safe means to reduce the risk of exposure to infection sources of the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, this distribution method may still pose a potential risk of spreading the disease.",

This has suddenly spurred them to the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.4 The likelihood that delivery workers (1) have direct contact with novel coronavirus\u2013infected customers without ever experiencing symptoms and (2) may subsequently act as a presymptomatic transmitter unwittingly passing the novel coronavirus to their healthy customers, coworkers, or families should be taken into consideration (Figure 1). Evidence has shown that presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission is 1 of the major routes by which the novel coronavirus spreads.5 Furthermore, 1 study indicates that presymptomatic transmission accounts for 6.4% of 157 locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in Singapore.6\n",

For example, in developed countries, such as the United States, Instacart offers the \u201cLeave at my door delivery\u201d option. In developing countries, such as Vietnam, GrabFood implements the contactless Grab transaction for which delivery workers will leave the meals at the designated position, standing 2 meters away to await customers.2.Strict use of new face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers. Delivery workers should wear new face masks and gloves, and frequently apply hand sanitizers to minimize contamination with the novel coronavirus.3.E-Wallet (ie, digital) or credit card payment method. In developing countries, digital payment or credit card payment is encouraged to limit contact with delivery workers.4.Discarding of packaging. Customers should discard the packaging as soon as possible and wash hands immediately after.\n",
