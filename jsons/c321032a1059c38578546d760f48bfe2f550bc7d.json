L-selectin has been found to be uniquely expressed on the CD56 high subset of peripheral blood human NK cells at a density higher than that of all other peripheral blood leukocytes, including CD56 low NK cells. NK cell activation results in modulation of L-selectin expression depending on the stimulus: phorbol esters, IL-2, IL-15, and TGF-\u03b2 down-regulate L-selectin on CD56 high NK cell subset, whereas increased levels can be observed on both NK cell subsets in response to IL-12, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b1. In accordance with these observations, CD56 high NK cells bind to the physiological L-selectin ligands on peripheral lymph node HEVs with higher efficiency as compared to the CD56 low subpopulation, thus resulting in a selective advantage of this population in extravasation across HEV [26] . There is also evidence from Uksila et al. [25] showing that a portion of CD16 + NK cells express L-selectin, and that IL-2 treatment diminishes the expression of this molecule and concomitantly increases the levels of \u03b1 4 integrin and CD44, two major receptors involved in lymphocyte binding to mucosal HEV. Thus, IL-2 activation of NK cells decreases adherence to peripheral LN HEV, while increasing adherence to mucosal HEV.",

The pattern of \u03b2 1 integrin expression changes upon NK cell activation, in that activated NK cells acquire \u03b1 1 \u03b2 1 and \u03b1 2 \u03b2 1 integrins, and down-regulate the expression of \u03b1 6 \u03b2 1 [24, 33-35]. \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 -VCAM-1 adhesive pathway is involved in the adhesion and migration of resting or IL-2-activated NK cells across IL-1\u03b2-, IFN\u03b3-, TNF-\u03b1-activated, but not resting, endothelial cells. Integrin-mediated NK cell interaction with endothelial cells is characterized by a peculiar structural feature: the formation of podosomes that represent dot-shaped protrusions of the cellular ventral membrane provided with adhesive properties and formed by particular cytoskeletal architecture [36] . Recent evidence indicates that the interaction of \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 integrin with VCAM-1 on porcine endothelial cells is also required for both rolling and firm adhesion of human NK cells to porcine endothelial cells [37] . \u03b1 4 integrin subunit can also associate with another \u03b2 chain, the \u03b2 7 , to give a functionally distinct integrin receptor capable of binding the mucosal vascular addressin MAdCAM-1. \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 is expressed on NK cells and mediates NK cell binding to mucosal HEV [25, 38, 39] . Functional evidences indicate, however, that NK cells expressing both \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 and \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 bind well to VCAM-1 but poorly to MAdCAM-1, suggesting that regulation of MAdCAM-1 versus VCAM-1 expression might critically control the recruitment of NK cell subsets to distinct tissues [40] .",

These observations have been further extended by Campbell and colleagues [48] who provided the first evidence that distinct (CD56 + CD16 + and CD56 + CD16 -) peripheral blood NK cell subsets have a unique repertoire of chemokine receptors. CD16 + NK cells uniformly express high levels of CXCR1 and CX3CR1, low levels of CXCR2 and CXCR3 and no detectable levels of CXCR5. By contrast, CD16 -NK cells express high levels of CXCR3, low levels of CX3CR1, and are negative for CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR5; moreover, both NK cell subsets express high levels of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12 (SDF-1\u03b1/\u03b2). With respect to the CC chemokine receptor family, these authors found that the majority of NK cells lack the expression of CCR1-7 and CCR9, and only the CD16 -NK cell subset expresses high levels of CCR5 and CCR7, the latter molecule mainly involved in the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs [48] .",

            "text": "The expression of Fak family members on NK is controversial. Rabinowich and colleagues [65] have reported that p125Fak is expressed on NK cells and that \u03b2 1 integrin engagement results in activation of this kinase and its association with Fyn and Zap-70 PTK. By contrast, we demonstrated that human peripheral blood NK cells express Pyk-2 that is constitutively associated with the cytoskeletal protein paxillin, but not p125 FAK. Engagement of \u03b2 1 or \u03b2 2 integrins on human NK cells results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both Pyk-2 and paxillin. Moreover, we demonstrated that Pyk-2 acts as an upstream mediator of \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 integrin-triggered MAPK cascades, and controls the development of NK cell-mediated natural cytotoxicity [66] [67] [68] . More recently, we have reported that NK cell binding to endothelium activates Pyk-2 and the small GTP-binding protein Rac, a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Both Pyk-2 and Rac activation are coupled to integrins and chemokine receptors. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding dominant negative mutants of Pyk-2 and Rac, we demonstrated that both Pyk-2 and Rac are functionally involved in chemokine-induced NK cell migration through endothelium or ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 adhesive proteins. We also found that Pyk-2 is associated with the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin triggering, but not with PIX, another exchange factor for Rac that is associated with paxillin through p95 PKL. Collectively, these results indicate that Pyk-2 acts as a receptor-proximal link between integrin and chemokine receptor signaling, and the Pyk-2/Rac pathway plays a pivotal role in the control of NK cell transendothelial migration [68] . These results are consistent with a report by Sancho et al. [69] indicating that Pyk-2 can colocalize with the microtubule-organizing center at the trailing edge of migrating NK cells and in the area of the NK cell membrane that faces target cells.",

In this model, however, NK cell recruitment was mediated by CCL2 (MCP-1), as neutralization of this chemokine resulted in reduced NK cell numbers in the lungs and impaired clearance of the pathogen from this organ [74] . Among CXC chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) has been reported to promote innate defense mechanisms following coronavirus infection in the central nervous system by recruiting and activating NK cells [75] . The involvement of CX3CL1 (fractalkine) in supporting NK cell migration in vivo has been provided by the evidence that CX3CL1-transfected tumor cells exhibit a reduced growth capability that is mediated by an increased recruitment of activated NK cells [76, 77] . In addition, using an in vivo model of NK cell-mediated lung tumor cell clearance and blocking antibodies against CX3CL1 or CX3CR1, it has been demonstrated that decreased clearance of tumor cells following perturbation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 interaction is attributable to defective NK cell recruitment to the lung [78] .",
