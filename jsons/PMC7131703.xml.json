            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), previously known as kennel cough, is an endemic respiratory syndrome, which is frequently observed in densely housed environments, such as kennels and animal shelters, due to overpopulation and continuous introduction of pathogens. CIRD has a multi-agent aetiology, with more than one viral or bacterial agent being involved sequentially or synergistically to cause disease (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007). Pathogens commonly associated with CIRD development include canine adenovirus 2 (CAdV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Less commonly, canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) can cause respiratory disease (Decaro et al., 2008b, Kawakami et al., 2010). Canine adenovirus 1 (CAdV-1) and canine distemper virus (CDV) infections are also involved in the development of respiratory disease, but they are usually characterized by multi-organ involvement (Decaro et al., 2008b, Decaro et al., 2007a). Apart from these pathogens, a plethora of emerging agents have been recently associated to CIRD, including canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2003, Decaro et al., 2007b), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV) (Renshaw et al., 2010, Decaro et al., 2014), non-primate canine hepacivirus (NPCHV) (Kapoor et al., 2011, El-Attar et al., 2015), canine bocaviruses (CBoV) (Kapoor et al., 2012) and the bacterial species Mycoplasma cynos (Chalker et al., 2004) and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (Chalker et al., 2003, Priestnall et al., 2010). Equine-derived canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N8 caused a large respiratory outbreak in the US in previous years (Crawford et al., 2005), but it has been now replaced by the avian-like virus H3N2 which has originated in southeastern Asia (Zhu et al., 2015) and is now spreading in the US (unpublished data). While there are some reports about the circulation of classical CIRD agents, data about new and emerging respiratory pathogens in dogs are scarce (Priestnall et al., 2014). Therefore, in order to obtain new insights into the epidemiology of canine respiratory agents, we have conducted an epidemiological survey using molecular methods in CIRD clinically ill, exposed and convalescent dogs in Italy between 2011 and 2013.",

Samples were considered positive if the amplification curves were higher than the threshold line generated by the software on the basis of the background fluorescence.

However, in recent years a plethora of novel agents have been associated to this infectious, multifactorial disease of dogs, thus leading to a resurgence of interest in canine respiratory pathogens (Priestnall et al., 2014). Epidemiological investigations aiming to identify the causes of CIRD, carried out in recent years, have yielded contrasting results. A longitudinal study on respiratory viruses in a rehoming kennel in UK with a history of CIRD demonstrated the circulation of CPIV, CRCoV and, at a lesser extent, of CaHV-1, while CAdVs and CDV were not detected (Erles et al., 2004). A survey for viral and bacterial agents in household dogs presented at various animal hospitals in Japan confirmed CPIV as the main agent of CIRD, although several ill dogs were infected with B. bronchiseptica and other pathogens including CRCoV, CAdV-2 and CDV, were detected in few animals (Mochizuki et al., 2008). Joffe et al. (2015) conducted a similar study in CIRD dogs submitted to Canadian veterinary clinics, finding a high prevalence of CPIV and M. cynos, while few dogs tested positive for CRCoV. A large survey carried out on 503 asymptomatic dogs of animal shelters in the US showed active circulation of M. cynos (61.3%), B. bronchiseptica (40.8%), CAdV-2 (26.3%), and CDV (15.4%), whereas CPIV, CRCoV, CaHV-1, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and CIV H3N8 were detected only sporadically (Lavan and Knesl, 2015). It is noteworthy that CDV, one of the most serious pathogens of dogs (Decaro et al., 2004), was present in a so high proportion of asymptomatic animals.",

B. bronchiseptica was detected mainly in dogs coinfected with other viral and bacterial agents, which resulted in higher clinical scores. It is well know that this bacterium can act as primary CIRD agent, but its pathogenic potential is increased with simultaneous viral and bacterial infections (Priestnall et al., 2014). As for the detected mycoplasmas, M. cynos is a well recognized cause of respiratory distress in dogs, while the pathogenetic role of M. canis is generally limited (Chalker et al., 2004). These findings were confirmed by the present study, where the former agent was significantly associated to high clinical scores alone or in co-infections with CRCoV and M. canis, whereas the latter induced no or very mild respiratory signs. Surprisingly, other classical CIRD pathogens, including CDV, CAdV-1 and mainly CAdV-2 were not identified in any sampled animals. CDV and CAdV-1 are responsible for very severe clinical forms, involving multiple organs and leading to high mortality of infected dogs (Martella et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2008b). In contrast, CAdV-2 infection is generally restricted to the respiratory tract and, even in the case of systemic spreading, the induced disease is confined to this apparatus (Decaro et al., 2008b). The lack of detection of these severe or mild classical CIRD agents even in kenneled dogs may be related to the extensive vaccination programs, which have enormously reduced their circulation in the canine population. However, sporadic re-emergence of canine distemper and canine infectious hepatitis in Italy has been observed in recent years as a consequence of uncontrolled, often illegal importation of purebred pups from eastern European countries. (Decaro et al., 2007a, Martella et al., 2008). CaHV-1 was not detected in any respiratory samples collected during the 2011\u20132013 epidemiological survey. Although this virus is more often associated with neonatal mortality in 2\u20133-week-old pups, the present findings are in contrast with those of previous studies reporting active circulation of CaHV-1 in CIRD dogs (Erles et al., 2004, Kawakami et al., 2010). In some circumstances, CaHV-1 was even proven to be responsible for fatal outbreaks of respiratory disease (Kumar et al., 2015).",

Generally, kenneled dogs are more prone to be infected by CIRD pathogens due to continuous introduction of animals, especially pups, lack of prophylactic measures of the handling personnel and high density of population that facilitates pathogen spreading among housed dogs. A possible explanation for our findings is that, in most instances, the CIRD agents were recovered from dogs displaying mild respiratory distress, which is often misrecognised in overcrowded environments presenting other, more severe clinical issues.",

According to the most recent WSAVA guidelines (Day et al., 2016), only those against systemic viral infections caused by CDV and CAdV-1, the latter being prevented using cross-reacting CAdV-2 modified live virus (MLV), are considered to be core vaccines. MLV or killed formulations are available also against CPIV and B. bronchiseptica, but these are considered as non-core vaccines and do not prevent active infection but only the induced disease (Day et al., 2016). Considering the increasing pathogenetic role of emerging viral and bacterial CIRD agents, specific vaccines are needed in the field. However, the recent studies have displayed spotted epidemiological situations on the basis of the geographic areas, so that vaccine formulations should be prepared taking into account the different pathogen distribution in the different countries.",
