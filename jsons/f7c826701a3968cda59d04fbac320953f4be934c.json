To further enrich this cohort's data, UKB has begun to link the wealth of information already collected from each individual to their primary care electronic health record (EHR) [1] . In the UK, the first point of contact with the health service for individuals with a new (non-emergency) medical problem or a chronic condition is their local general practitioner (GP). These GPs also receive information from the specialist health services that they refer their patients to, resulting in a closed loop communication system which should result in a complete (time-stamped) summary of their patients' medical conditions, investigations, regular (prescribed) medications, etc. Introducing primary care EHR information will enable UKB researchers and policy makers to assess the course and outcomes of a plethora of different diseases and risk-factors at scale, whilst allowing them to simultaneously explore the genetic factors associated with each.",

A total of four data sources (two in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales) using four different controlled clinical terminologies (containing more than 500,000 terms to record information) and different data schemas are used. As a result, researchers with no previous experience working with primary care EHR would need to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to create phenotyping algorithms for important biomarkers e.g. blood pressure or haematological laboratory markers. This is further complicated by several recent meta-research reports that have identified significant methodological issues with biomarker development research [2] , which has resulted in large amounts of research waste [3] . Specifically, these reviews suggest that biomarker discovery pipelines and processes are often plagued by poor methodology [2] ; the end result of which is poor replicability of results, as was recently demonstrated by the inability to replicate sample sizes and modelling outcomes in several studies using a large critical care database [4] . Preventing research waste in EHR-based biomarker discovery requires robust clinical validation of phenotypes. However, relying on individual clinical-academics to manually review and refine all of the phenotyping algorithms under development is not easily scalable. As such, an automated but more robust approach for creating and evaluating EHR phenotyping algorithms for biomarkers in primary care data is necessary to address the aforementioned methodological concerns.",

It is likely that many non-EHR-specialists will be working UKB data for the foreseeable future, and given that the pandemic has already had significant and widespread societal, economic, medical and health service impacts globally [8] , there is an impetus to ensure rapid access of these critical data to researchers during this public health emergency, whilst ensuring that this does not come at the cost of research quality [10] .

The entity types were used here to give a starting point for Read terms that may be used to record a particular clinical measurement. Additionally, differences in data schemas mean that information is recorded in different ways: for example, data in Scotland can have the units specified as free text in addition to another two values while data from England (TPP) do not specify units and only cover a single value field. Entity types are easier to manipulate given that only a few hundred exist and the group of related Read terms can then be used to identify equivalent terms in CTV3 via the mapping and hence identify equivalent data in the different data sources.",

Lastly, it provides research-ready phenotyping algorithms for commonly recorded biomarkers in primary care for users. The observed distribution values of the measurements across all biomarkers are consistent with the standard reference ranges for normal results [23] .

The likelihood of this happening however is low given that CTV3 encapsulates Read v2 and GPs tend to use the same set of terms over time. Due to the manner in which codes are used, similar but distinct measurements were sometimes grouped under the same entity code and were incorrectly included by the approach -for example, most lipid measurements had both plasma and serum related terms and manual review subsequently removed the plasma measurements for consistency.

As such, the phenotyping algorithms that have resulted from this work should hopefully facilitate rapid and robust access to the primary care EHR data for UKB participants during the COVID-19 public health emergency, and long after.This study is part of the BigData@Heart programme that has received funding from the InnovativeMedicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement no. 116074.
