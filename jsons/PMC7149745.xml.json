We now know that germ-line-encoded receptors or other molecules with pattern-recognition capabilities can detect and respond to generally distinct microbial structures, which are conserved and shared by related groups of microorganisms. Moreover, innate immune recognition mechanisms act as sophisticated mediators between detection of infection and induction of the appropriate adaptive immune response (Fearon, 1997, Medzhitov, 2007). However, innate defense mechanisms against infectious agents have a much older history, and the exocrine secretions of the body contain a great number of distinct soluble factors that protect the body from the majority of potential pathogens that enter along with food and air or by intimate contact between individuals. These constitute the principal subject of this chapter.",

Evidence for this is seen in IgA-deficient subjects who lack secretory IgA antibodies in their secretions and yet are not severely compromised, even though the deficiency may be partially compensated for by secretory IgM or small amounts of IgG in secretions (see Chapter 105). Furthermore, innate defense mechanisms help to define the minimal requirements for successful colonization by commensal and pathogenic organisms: those that cannot adapt to these conditions will be incapable of maintaining themselves within the host. Much of the earlier work on innate defense systems in mucosal secretions was performed in saliva or milk, which are readily accessible in large quantities. However, it has become apparent that similar mechanisms operate in most secretions, although with significant differences of detail. Increased attention to the antimicrobial factors present in the genital tract occasioned by the AIDS epidemic, for example, has revealed that this tract has multiple non-immunoglobulin-based defense mechanisms (Quayle, 2002).",

Most such surfaces are reinforced by the copious secretion of mucus, which is propelled by peristaltic or ciliary action and is thought to physically entrap microparticles, including microorganisms; however, specific interactions between mucins and bacterial receptors may also be involved (Lichtman et al., 1996; see also Chapter 14). Furthermore, mucosal surfaces desquamate, and there is a considerable turnover of epithelial cells (estimated at 1011/day from the human small intestine alone; Potten and Morris, 1988) which, on shedding, carry with them a burden of attached microorganisms.",

Furthermore, epithelial cells have been found to synthesize complement components C3, C4, and factor B (Strunk et al., 1988). However, the concentrations of complement components present are usually well below those found in serum, and consequently it is uncertain whether complement operates as a fully functional system in secretions, especially in the absence of overt inflammation in the corresponding mucosal tissue. On the other hand, high concentrations of biologically active complement components are detected in the gingival crevicular fluid, which bathes the space (crevice) between the teeth and the free gingiva (Hajishengallis, 2010).",

            "text": "Phagocytes represent a major component of innate defense at the cellular level, and all classes of phagocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells, occur within mucosal tissues. Some of them develop special characteristics in accordance with their location, for example, mucosal mast cells and lamina propria macrophages. Although the activities of phagocytes may be largely confined to the tissues themselves, at least under normal healthy circumstances, rather than taking place within the lumen, the microenvironment close to the mucosal surface may permit phagocytic activity, as in the case of alveolar macrophages. As most secretions are hypotonic, phagocytes probably do not survive with functional activity for long in the bulk fluid phase. However, their contents may be released upon lysis or through induced degranulation and thereby contribute to the soluble antimicrobial factors in the secretions. Part of the lactoferrin (Lf) and lysozyme, as well as myeloperoxidase (as distinct from secretory peroxidase), found in whole saliva or milk, for example, originates from neutrophils emigrating into the gingival crevice or the lactating mammary gland (Moldoveanu et al., 1982). Milk, however, is isotonic and contains variable numbers of both macrophages and neutrophils, depending upon the stage of lactation and both exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Huge numbers of neutrophils accumulate rapidly in milk in response to infection (mastitis), but their phagocytic activities are compromised by constituents of milk, particularly casein, which they ingest in competition with the microorganisms. This results in premature activation, diversion, and attenuation of the neutrophil intracellular killing mechanisms (Grazioso and Buescher, 1996, Russell and Reiter, 1975, Paape et al., 2003).",

CRP activates complement C1q in the presence of phosphorylcholine, which is present on apoptotic cells and is also a constituent of the capsule of certain bacteria. CRP can also bind phosphoethanolamine, a constituent of the cell membrane of Salmonella enterica. These activities enable CRP to confer protection against a number of microbial pathogens through opsonization, including S. pneumoniae (Szalai et al., 1995), Haemophilus influenzae (Lysenko et al., 2000), and Sa. enterica (Szalai et al., 2000), as demonstrated in mouse models of infection.

            "text": "SAP has a molecular mass similar to that of CRP and 51% identity with CRP and is also produced by hepatocytes in response to IL-6 (Bottazzi et al., 2010). SAP can bind to phosphorylcholine and, similar to CRP, promote apoptotic cell clearance. SAP can also bind to microbial surface structures such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and terminal mannose or galactose residues. Important pathogens detected by SAP include Streptococcus pyogenes and Neisseria meningitidis. In vivo studies to determine the role of SAP in infection have produced mixed results, as well as data that cannot be readily interpreted. For instance, SAP was shown to protect against infection with pathogens that it cannot bind (Listeria monocytogenes) (Singh et al., 1986), whereas it enhanced the virulence of some of the pathogens it can interact with (S. pyogenes and rough strains of Escherichia coli) (Noursadeghi et al., 2000). The latter effect might be attributed to an antiopsonic effect of SAP bound to the pathogen, thereby reducing its opsonophagocytic killing. This suggests that certain SAP-coated pathogens may evade immunity rather than being tagged for opsonophagocytosis. Whereas CRP can be used as a diagnostic marker of inflammation (within 24 h, its plasma concentration rises by as much as 1000-fold over the baseline, \u22643 mg/L), the levels of SAP are virtually invariant (30\u201350 mg/L) (Bottazzi et al., 2010).",

In addition to a C-terminal pentraxin-like domain that is homologous to that of CRP and SAP, PTX3 contains a unique N-terminal region, which mediates some of its binding activities (e.g., conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus) (Bottazzi et al., 2010). PTX3 is rapidly induced in a variety of cell types, including myeloid dendritic cells and phagocytes, in response to TLR activation. In neutrophils, PTX3 is constitutively stored in the specific granules and is released by several stimuli, including TLR agonists (Maina et al., 2009).",

Intriguingly, polymorphisms in the PTX3 gene are associated with risk for pulmonary tuberculosis and P. aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis (Olesen et al., 2007, Chiarini et al., 2010). Furthermore, PTX3 mediates a variety of antiviral activities against influenza viruses, including inhibition of virus-induced hemagglutination and viral neuramidase activity, as well as neutralization of virus infectivity in vitro (Reading et al., 2008).",

The interaction of PTX3 with C1q bound to plastic (mimicking a microbial surface) leads to activation of the classical complement cascade.

These data were interpreted to mean that PTX3 can promote the clearance of pathogens tagged by PTX3, whereas in the fluid phase PTX3 may protect against unwarranted complement activation (Bottazzi et al., 2010). PTX3 also interacts with factor H, a major negative regulator of the alternative pathway. This interaction promotes the deposition of functionally active factor H and iC3b on apoptotic cells and prevents excessive activation of the alternative complement cascade, thereby limiting tissue damage under inflammatory conditions (Deban et al., 2008).",

This anti-inflammatory activity is dependent on the N-linked glycosidic moiety of PTX3, which is reminiscent of a similar regulatory activity of IgG mediated by its Fc core polysaccharide (Kaneko et al., 2006). In fact, PTX3 is just one of two known secreted molecules that can directly block the leukocyte adhesion cascade and limit neutrophil extravasation at mucosal sites, the other one being the endothelial glycoprotein Del-1, an antagonist of the LFA-1 integrin (Eskan et al., 2012).",

MBL can also initiate complement activation by binding to IgA (Roos et al., 2001). Another well-known collectin is bovine conglutinin, which interacts with the complement breakdown product iC3b and is able to neutralize influenza A virus (Hartshorn et al., 1993). Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D (which is closely related to conglutinin) occur in the lung surfactant, and are synthesized by type II alveolar cells (Hoppe and Reid, 1994). SP-A and possibly SP-D can bind to bacteria and viruses via carbohydrate groups and promote their phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, possibly through interaction with the C1q or related receptors (Nepomuceno et al., 1997). Moreover, SP-A inhibits TLR2-dependent St. aureus peptidoglycan-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in human monocytic cells and rat alveolar macrophages by binding directly to TLR2 (Murakami et al., 2002a). SP-A can regulate the innate immune response also by binding CD14 and thereby preventing cellular activation in response to certain serotypes of LPS (Sano et al., 1999).",

Milk-derived sCD14 may facilitate neonatal intestinal epithelial cell responses to LPS (Lab\u00e9ta et al., 2000), but conversely, injury may be induced by LPS in renal tubular epithelial cells, leading to proteinuria (Bussolati et al., 2002). In contrast to the agonistic activity of sCD14 in mCD14-negative cells, high levels of sCD14 may inhibit LPS-induced TNF release in monocytes/macrophages (Haziot et al., 1994). Mechanistically, sCD14 can compete with mCD14 for LPS thereby promoting LPS efflux from mCD14 and transfer to plasma lipoproteins (Kitchens and Thompson, 2005). In vivo studies suggest that sCD14 may exert protective local proinflammatory effects in tissues, whereas, conversely, it may exert systemic anti-inflammatory effects (Kitchens and Thompson, 2005). In this regard, sCD14 levels are upregulated in sepsis (Landmann et al., 2000), possibly mitigating the severity of disease, because LPS lethality in mice was diminished by recombinant sCD14 (Haziot et al., 1995).",

Thus low LBP concentrations may enhance the biological activity of LPS, whereas during the acute phase high concentrations may be inhibitory, as suggested by the protective effect of LBP against endotoxin shock in mice (Lamping et al., 1998). Thus, similar to sCD14, LBP also has dual stimulatory and inhibitory effects that are believed to promote protective inflammation against gram-negative bacteria in local sites while preventing potentially destructive inflammation in response to LPS.",

The original observation involved an alternatively spliced murine TLR4 mRNA, which results in the expression of a secretory form of TLR4 (sTLR4) devoid of transmembrane and intracellular domains (Iwami et al., 2000). Functionally, sTLR4 inhibits LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation and TNF release. Since that observation, soluble forms of several TLRs (e.g., TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6) have been detected in human plasma, milk, parotid saliva, or amniotic fluid (Kacerovsky et al., 2012, Kuroishi et al., 2007, LeBouder et al., 2003). In terms of function, human sTLRs act as negative regulators of TLR-mediated cellular activation. For instance, sTLR2 in parotid saliva can bind TLR2 agonists in the fluid phase and thereby inhibit TLR2-dependent cytokine induction (Kuroishi et al., 2007). More recently, a soluble form of TLR9 was shown to be generated by a specific proteolytic event in the endolysosomal compartment and to inhibit TLR9-dependent signaling (Chockalingam et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Although lysozymes isolated from different species or even from different tissues of the same species show similar biological activity, they differ biochemically and in specific activity. Human lysozyme has a higher specific activity and more potent antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms than hen egg-white lysozyme (Iacono et al., 1980). However, few species of bacteria are directly lysed by lysozyme, and other modes of action independent of its enzymatic activity include the activation of bacterial autolysins, bacterial aggregation, blocking of bacterial adherence, and inhibition of acid production by oral microorganisms (Iacono et al., 1985, Laible and Germaine, 1985, Twetman et al., 1986, Wang and Germaine, 1991). Moreover, cell walls of oral streptococci weakened by cleavage of peptidoglycan (Cho et al., 1982) become susceptible to lysis by the addition of detergents or monovalent anions such as bicarbonate, fluoride, thiocyanate, and chloride, which predominate in saliva (Pollock et al., 1987). Its cationic property (pI 10.5) may allow lysozyme to exert bactericidal activity analogous to other cationic proteins, and although binding to oral bacteria is strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength, bacteriolysis caused by lysozyme may be physiologically significant in the oral environment, where these parameters can fluctuate markedly. However, there is no clear evidence that salivary levels of lysozyme are related to the occurrence of dental caries or periodontal disease (Tenovuo, 1989). Remarkably, lysozyme is reported to display inhibitory activity against HIV-1 (Lee-Huang et al., 1999).",

It is thought that \u03b1-lactalbumin evolved from calcium-binding lysozyme c after the divergence of birds and mammals, as it retains the conserved calcium-binding residues found in lysozyme c (McKenzie and White, 1991). Although normally devoid of muramidase or antibacterial activity, a variant form of \u03b1-lactalbumin was found to induce apoptosis in tumor cells (Svensson et al., 1999). This variant, designated HAMLET (human \u03b1-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), assumes an oligomeric \u201cmolten globule\u201d conformation induced by the release of calcium at low pH in the presence of oleic acid (Svensson et al., 2000). As these conditions occur in the nursing infant stomach, it was speculated that HAMLET might serve to protect the infant gut. HAMLET is bactericidal against S. pneumoniae (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2000, Hakansson et al., 2011) by a mechanism akin to starvation and involving sodium-dependent calcium influx (Clementi et al., 2012). At sublethal concentrations HAMLET augments the effects of common antibiotics against the same pathogen (Marks et al., 2012).",

Lf-knockout mice show no abnormalities of iron status (Ward et al., 2003). Although many functions have been proposed for Lf relating to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities, it is uncertain which of these are relevant in vivo. Lf is synthesized by a variety of mucosal tissues, major sites being the mammary gland and the genital tract (reviewed by Teng, 2002), although some mammals (e.g., rats and rabbits) contain no Lf in their milk (Masson and Heremans, 1971). Lf is found in the secondary granules of neutrophils and is synthesized by myeloid precursors, not mature neutrophils (Rado et al., 1987).

Each lobe is in turn folded into two domains, separated by a cleft in which each iron-binding site is located. In all cases Fe3+ is liganded to an aspartic acid, two tyrosines, and a histidine, together with two oxygen atoms from a synergistically bound carbonate ion (Baker, 1994). Iron binding and release are associated with conformational changes in the protein (Anderson et al., 1990). The open \u201capo\u201d form is more susceptible to denaturation and proteolytic digestion than the Fe-bound (\u201cholo\u201d) form. Iron is released at pH <3, whereas in transferrin iron release occurs at pH \u223c5.5 (Mazurier and Spik, 1980).

Apo-Lf is bacteriostatic, as it inhibits the growth of various bacteria in vitro, and addition of iron abolishes its activity, indicating that inhibition of iron uptake is involved. Many microorganisms are susceptible to iron deprivation, including mucosal pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio cholerae (Weinberg, 2001). However, many bacteria can overcome this effect by secreting low-molecular-weight high-affinity iron chelators (siderophores) that can remove iron from Lf, or by scavenging iron from other sources (Brock et al., 1991). Others, notably Haemophilus and Neisseria, express specific Lf receptors, regulated by iron levels, which allow them to acquire Lf-bound iron (Gray-Owen and Schryvers, 1996). Lack of iron in P. aeruginosa prevents it from forming a biofilm, thereby making it more susceptible to other host defense mechanisms (Singh et al., 2002). In contrast, Fe\u2013Lf inhibits binding of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (Fine and Furgang, 2002), suggesting that low iron levels might aid colonization.",

Lf occurs at high concentration (\u223c1 mg/mL) in human milk, and breast-fed babies are less susceptible than bottle-fed babies to gastrointestinal infection, suggesting that Lf might be an important factor in breast milk. However, attempts to modify the gastrointestinal microbiota of bottle-fed infants by supplementing formula milks with Lf have failed to confirm this (Roberts et al., 1992). Nevertheless, oral administration of Lf can protect against bacterial infection in animal models, for example, amelioration of Helicobacter infection possibly by glycan-mediated interference with bacterial adherence (Wang et al., 2001), reduction of the overgrowth and translocation of enterobacteria in mice fed bovine milk (Teraguchi et al., 1995), reduced severity of systemic E. coli infection in neonatal rats infected orally (Edde et al., 2001), and protection of rabbits against Shigella flexneri infection, through inhibition of bacterial uptake by host cells (Gomez et al., 2003). An antibacterial effect of Lf dependent upon iron binding was revealed when \u03b22-microglobulin-knockout mice, which suffer from an iron overload condition similar to human hemochromatosis, became less susceptible to tuberculosis after treatment with Lf (Schaible et al., 2002). These studies suggest that Lf might have therapeutic benefit in certain bacterial infections in humans.",

Lf appears to be most effective at the early stages of infection, acting either by blocking viral receptors on host cells or by binding directly to the virus. Lf blocks entry of rotavirus into enterocytes by a mechanism that is independent of iron saturation, but enhanced by desialylation, and mimicked by two tryptic peptides distinct from the lactoferricin region (Superti et al., 2001). A C-terminal region peptide of Lf binds to hepatitis C virus E2 protein and prevents interaction with the host cell (Nozaki et al., 2003). In contrast, inhibition of hepatitis B virus infection in vitro depends upon the interaction of Lf with hepatocytes rather than the virus (Hara et al., 2002). The lactoferricin region of Lf is partly responsible for its ability to inhibit binding of HIV to the CXCR4 or the CCR5 chemokine receptor (Berkhout et al., 2002).",

In neutrophils Lf inhibits binding of LPS to L-selectin and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (Baveye et al., 2000). LPS-mediated IL-8 production by endothelial cells is inhibited by Lf through its basic N-terminal region (Elass et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 1999). Conversely, immobilized (not soluble) Lf stimulates eosinophil activation (Thomas et al., 2002), suggesting that Lf bound to airway epithelial cells might exacerbate asthma.",

Increasing evidence suggests that Lf is multifunctional, with iron binding, release of basic peptides, and even proteolytic activity contributing to different functional scenarios. Pediatric clinical trials of Lf have been encouraging in terms of safety, as well as efficacy in certain cases, such as reducing the incidence of late-onset sepsis in infants, but more studies are warranted to further address its safety and efficacy in the treatment of neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and enteric and respiratory infections (Ochoa et al., 2012, Pammi and Abrams, 2011).",

Bovine LPO preparations are heterogeneous (Paul and Ohlsson, 1985): a major fraction consists of a single polypeptide chain of 78.5 kDa, and smaller molecules are derived by loss of carbohydrate groups or deamidation of asparagine or glutamine residues. Human SPO is also heterogeneous, and at least three major forms of 78, 80, and 280 kDa have been reported (M\u00e5nsson-Rahemtulla et al., 1988).

In human saliva, gp340 binds HIV-1 gp120 and inhibits viral infection (Wu et al., 2006).

This provides an efficient means for bacteria such as Actinomyces viscosus, S. mutans, and Streptococcus gordonii to bind to teeth without being cleared from the oral cavity (reviewed by Lamkin and Oppenheim, 1993). Acidic PRPs on the tooth surface can be degraded into peptides having potential defense properties (Madapallimattan and Bennick, 1990). For example, the antimicrobial pentapeptide Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro-Gln is proteolytically generated from acidic PRPs by commensal Streptococcus and Actinomyces spp. The synthetic pentapeptide desorbed bound bacteria and counteracted sucrose-induced decrease of dental plaque pH in vitro (Li et al., 2000).

SLPI is a potent inhibitor of serine proteinases (such as human leukocyte elastase) and is also capable of inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity in vitro (McNeely et al., 1995). In the oral cavity SLPI may impede the ability of HIV-1 to infect additional target cells (Wahl et al., 1997). SLPI blocks HIV-1 infection of macrophages and primary T cells at concentrations (1\u201310 \u03bcg/mL) that occur naturally in saliva (Shugars and Wahl, 1998). These findings suggest that SLPI may be partially responsible for the low rate of oral transmission of HIV-1. Although numerous studies report that SLPI protects cultured mononuclear cells against infection, the inhibition of HIV-1 infection of human macrophages is highly variable (Konopka et al., 1999, Turpin et al., 1996). These discrepancies have been attributed to factors such as variability of macrophage susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and the quality of SLPI preparations (Shine et al., 2002). In addition to SLPI, there are other endogenous inhibitors of HIV-1 in oral secretions, including thrombospondin, Lf, mucins, cystatins, and PRPs. Thrombospondin, which aggregates the virus and blocks virus\u2013CD4 interaction during viral entry, is effective at physiological concentrations (Crombie et al., 1998), whereas the others inhibit HIV only at supraphysiological concentrations.",

S100-A8 (also known as myeloid-related protein-8; MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) are abundant cytoplasmic proteins in neutrophils and can form MRP8/14 heterodimers (also known as calprotectin) with antimicrobial activity (Achouiti et al., 2012, Ma et al., 2010). In mice, these antimicrobial proteins protect against lung infection with Klebsiella pneumonia (Achouiti et al., 2012), whereas treatments that interfere with IL-17 production diminish the release of MRP8/14 and exacerbate pulmonary mucosal infection with S. pneumoniae (Ma et al., 2010). However, S-100 proteins are also endogenous activators of TLR4 and have been implicated in endotoxin-induced shock (Vogl et al., 2007) and in inflammatory bowel disease (Manolakis et al., 2011).
