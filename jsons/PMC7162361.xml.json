            "text": "Morpholino oligos (Morpholinos) are synthetic uncharged P\u2010chiral analogs of nucleic acids. They are typically constructed by linking together 25 subunits, each bearing one of the four nucleic acid bases. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of three Morpholino subunits joined by inter\u2010subunit linkages. The morpholino phosphorodiamidate backbone of Morpholinos consists of morpholine rings that bear methylene groups and are bound through modified phosphates in which the anionic oxygen is replaced by a nonionic dimethylamino group. The substituted phosphate is bound through an oxygen atom to the morpholine's exocyclic methylene group, and through a phosphorus\u2010nitrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of another morpholine ring. One standard DNA nucleobase (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine) is bound to each morpholine ring. The ends of Morpholinos are conventionally named 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 by analogy with the nomenclature for nucleic acids (although if one were to number the atoms of a morpholino oligonucleotide backbone by IUPAC rules, the numbers assigned to the ends would be different). The secondary amine of the morpholine ring at the end of an unmodified morpholino oligonucleotide is called the 3\u2032 end of the oligo, whereas the 5\u2032 end terminates with a chiral carboxamidated phosphorodiamidate group (Fig. 1).",

This favors the interaction of Morpholinos with nucleic acids, since there is no repulsion between anionic backbones as there is in duplexes of natural nucleic acids. When dissolved in pure water, nucleic acids lose their ability to form stable Watson\u2010Crick bonds due to anionic repulsion between strands, whereas Morpholinos will still bind to complementary nucleic acid sequences (Summerton, 2004). Because Morpholinos are uncharged, they have no strong electrostatic interactions with proteins. Unmodified Morpholinos have little or no affinity for bovine or human serum albumin (H.M. Moulton, unpub. observ.). In contrast, interactions of anionic phosphorothioate oligos with proteins cause multiple physiological, non\u2010antisense effects (Lebedeva and Stein, 2001). Proteins that bind nucleic acids generally interact electrostatically with the anionic phosphates of nucleic acids, stabilizing binding. Morpholinos appear to have little or no interaction with nucleic acid\u2013binding proteins (Hudziak et al., 1996).",

In no case was degradation of the Morpholinos detected (Hudziak et al., 1996). Morpholinos were incubated in serum and in liver homogenate without degradation (Summerton and Weller, 1997).

However, study of a morpholino phosphorodiamidate ApA dimer using circular dichroic spectroscopy showed stacking of bases in aqueous phosphate buffer (Kang et al., 1992). On the basis of molecular modeling, the bases of Morpholinos should stack in a fashion analogous to those of natural nucleic acids, allowing strong interactions with complementary nucleic acid sequences by Watson\u2010Crick base pairing. A 400 MHz 1H NMR analysis of a carbamate\u2010linked Morpholino found the morpholine ring in the chair conformation (Stirchak et al., 1989). Molecular modeling of a Morpholino with the morpholine rings in the chair conformation suggests that a Morpholino and an RNA form an A\u2010form heteroduplex with a helical pitch similar to that of an A\u2010form RNA\u2010RNA duplex (J.E.

However, single strands of mRNA folded into secondary structures contain single\u2010stranded regions, such as the loops of stem\u2010loops, with which Morpholinos can readily hybridize. Because double\u2010stranded regions of most RNA secondary structures are shorter than 25 base pairs, the overall binding affinity of Morpholinos for RNA is usually sufficient to invade and displace those short double\u2010stranded regions (Summerton, 1999).",

            "text": "Radioisotope delivery into organisms can be pretargeted using Morpholinos (Mang'era et al., 2001). Practitioners of nuclear medicine strive to minimize radiation exposure of a patient while delivering radionuclides to target tissues for imaging or for therapeutic applications. By attaching radioisotopes to antibodies that are specific for target tissues, the antibodies can anchor isotopes on these tissues. Because the large antibody molecules diffuse slowly, the isotopes must be maintained in the plasma at high concentrations or for long durations to achieve good delivery of radioisotope\u2010linked antibodies to their targets. Pretargeting with Morpholinos involves introducing an antibody\u2010Morpholino conjugate into the bloodstream; this can be done using high concentrations or re\u2010dosing to saturate the target without exposing the patient to radiation during this pretargeting stage. Next, a conjugate of a radioisotope (possibly chelated) with a complementary Morpholino is added to the blood. Because the Morpholino has a much smaller molecular mass than an antibody, the radionuclide\u2010Morpholino conjugate diffuses relatively quickly and is captured at the target tissue more rapidly through Morpholino\u2010Morpholino pairing. Unbound radionuclide\u2010Morpholino conjugate is rapidly eliminated through the kidneys.

In the first steps of translation, the initiation complex forms at the 5\u2032 cap and then scans through the UTR to the start codon (Fig. 3A). At the start codon, the large ribosomal subunit binds, the initiation factors dissociate, and translation proceeds through the coding region. If a Morpholino gets in the way of the initiation complex before the initiation complex reaches the start codon, it prevents assembly of the ribosome and translation of the mRNA. Nonetheless, it is preferable to target the start codon instead of upstream sequences for two reasons. First, the quality of sequence deposited in public databases is often poor in the UTR, especially for older sequence records. Second, although rare in vertebrate genomes, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) do exist and can allow a ribosome to enter and assemble downstream of a Morpholino bound in the 5\u2032\u2010UTR.",

However, since Morpholinos are not charged they will not form electrostatic complexes with cationic delivery reagents. Without such complexation, the Morpholinos are poorly delivered to the cytosol of treated cell cultures. To overcome this limitation, Morpholinos can be annealed to complementary or partially complementary strands of anionic nucleic acids. Special Delivery oligos are heteroduplexes of Morpholinos and partially complementary DNA, and are delivered after complexation with a cationic delivery reagent, usually EPEI (Morcos, 2001). Special Delivery oligos were designed as a replacement for scrape loading of adherent cells, but can also be used with cells in suspension. Special Delivery oligos provide a more homogeneous delivery than scrape loading, and many studies have been published using them. However, several problems are inherent in the system: (1) EPEI is somewhat toxic to cells; (2) the concentration ratio of heteroduplex to EPEI is fixed; (3) only a single oligo sequence can be delivered at an effective concentration at any one time; and (4) the complexation procedure, which must be done prior to each delivery, adds complexity and variability to the experiment. Special Delivery oligos can be made by following a fairly simple design and hybridization protocol. This approach has mostly been supplanted by Endo\u2010Porter, which is simpler to use, more versatile, more effective, and less toxic in most cell types.",

However, as with any custom\u2010sequence control oligo, there is a possibility that the 5\u2010mispair oligo will interact with an untargeted RNA, triggering an off\u2010target effect. If an oligo targets a high\u2010copy\u2010number transcript, requiring relatively high Morpholino concentration for knockdown, and the mispair oligo interacts with a low\u2010copy\u2010number transcript, the mispair oligo might cause effects even at concentrations below the concentration at which the targeting oligo becomes effective.",

The definition of the effective and specific concentration range based on a 5\u2010mispair oligo evolved through trial and error. Originally a 4\u2010mispair specificity control was recommended, but a 4\u2010mispair oligo sometimes measurably decreased the target protein concentration at concentrations low enough that the corresponding targeting oligo was just becoming effective, so there was not a wide enough effective and specific concentration range to be consistently useful. Many investigators use the 5\u2010mispair oligo as a negative control, but that was not its intended purpose. Assuming that adding the mismatches does not create too much complementarity to an important off\u2010target mRNA and trigger an off\u2010target knockdown, the 5\u2010mispair oligo usually behaves as a negative control when used at concentrations low enough that the targeting oligo is just becoming effective. However, the 5\u2010mispair oligo is intended as a specificity control to be used in an experiment to determine the effective and specific concentration window. The 5\u2010mispair oligo is intended as a specificity control that shows the targeting oligo is being used in its effective and specific range. To demonstrate specificity of the targeting oligo, the targeting oligo, a 5\u2010mispair control oligo, and a true negative control oligo (such as the standard control) are used at the same concentration in parallel treatments. If the 5\u2010mispair and negative control oligos produce the same results, and the targeting oligo produces a different result, the experiment indicates that the targeting oligo has been used within its effective and specific concentration range. Appearance of an effect due to interaction of a target RNA with the 5\u2010mispair control oligo suggests that, at that same concentration, the targeting oligo might also interact with off\u2010target RNAs.",

Therefore, if exposure to plastic surfaces is required, it is best to do the procedures with Morpholinos in a relatively concentrated state (>1 \u00b5M). Similarly, if Morpholinos are to be stored in solution for more than a few days, it is best to store them at high concentration.
