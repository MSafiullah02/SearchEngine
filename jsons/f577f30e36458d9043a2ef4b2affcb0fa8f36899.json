The main purpose of this work is to describe its evolution using ultrasound measurements of muscular excursion and thickening fraction (TF). Single-center prospective study of 79 consecutive uncomplicated elective cardiac surgery patients, using motion-mode during quiet unassisted breathing. Excursion and TF were measured sequentially for each patient [pre-operative (D1), 1 day (D2) and 5 days (D3) after surgery]. Pre-operative median for right and left hemidiaphragmatic excursions were 1.8 (IQR 1.6 to 2.1) cm and 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) cm, respectively. Pre-operative median right and left thickening fractions were 28 (19 to 36) % and 33 (22 to 51) %, respectively. At D2, there was a reduction in both excursion (right: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8) cm, p < 0.001, left: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.8), p = 0.003) and thickening fractions (right: 20 (15 to 34) %, p = 0.021, left: 24 (17 to 39) %, p = 0.002), followed by a return to pre-operative values at D3. A positive moderate correlation was found between excursion and thickening fraction (Spearman's rho 0.518 for right and 0.548 for left hemidiaphragm, p < 0.001). Interobserver reliability yielded a bias below 0.1 cm with limits of agreement (LOA) of \u00b1 0.3 cm for excursion and \u2212 2% with LOA of \u00b1 21% for thickening fractions. After cardiac surgery, the evolution of diaphragmatic function is characterized by a transient impairment followed by a quick recovery. Although ultrasound diaphragmatic excursion and thickening fraction are correlated, excursion seems to be a more feasible and reproducible method in this population.",

            "text": "Impaired diaphragmatic function following cardiac surgery due to mechanical or hypothermal damage to the phrenic nerve has been well described [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although moderate in most cases, up to 6% of patients may suffer more severe forms of diaphragmatic dysfunction leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation and associated pulmonary complications [5] . But apart from clinically relevant diaphragmatic dysfunctions, little is known about the natural course of diaphragmatic function in the early post-operative period. Providing such description would help to better understand the impact of cardiac surgery on diaphragm function. Among the different tools to assess diaphragm performance, ultrasound (US) techniques have gained an increasingly prominent role as a non-invasive bedside imaging modality due to their simplicity, non-invasiveness, feasibility and reproducibility [6] [7] [8] [9] . US measurements have also shown good correlation with the reference method, i.e., transdiaphragmatic pressure measurement, whose semi-invasive nature, complexity and expertise requirement compare unfavorably against echography in daily clinical use [6] .",

Imaging quality check included regularity in amplitude and frequency of the DE and visibility of the diaphragmatic line throughout the respiratory cycle. In each patient, to ensure that all measurements were made from the same acoustic window, the distance between probe placement and the lower extremity of the ribcage on the mid-axillary line was measured and used as the reference site for the subsequent exams. Under normal quiet breathing conditions, hemidiaphragm dysfunction was defined as an excursion < 1 cm (cm) downwards during inspiration, and diaphragmatic paralysis corresponded to an absence of motion (0 cm) or a paradoxical motion (diaphragmatic ascension during inspiration) [8] .",

The diaphragmatic muscle layer was then measured between the pleura and peritoneum at both end-inspiration and end-expiration using regular M-mode, and the values averaged over 3 consecutive respiratory cycles (Fig. 1b) . Hemidiaphragm thickening was defined as the difference between end-inspiratory and end-expiratory thickness values, measured in mm. We further calculated TF as: Exams were performed individually by experienced operators (AT, PC, MA, JPL, ML, MRL).

After this apparent diaphragm \"stunning\", a rapid normalization to pre-operative values for right and left excursion ensued. In 36% of these patients, the reduction in DE was seemingly severe enough to be graded as \"dysfunction\" according to current criteria [8] . Nevertheless, this greater reduction in excursion was also transient and showed rapid recovery by D3. Based on a clinical uneventful course for our patient population, such dysfunction is probably benign in nature. Moreover, this alteration in diaphragmatic function, even in case of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, was not associated with clinical signs of respiratory impairment. Studies on diaphragmatic function focusing on cardiac surgery patients with an uneventful course are scarce. Lerolle et al. studied the diaphragm of patients with difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation and a comparator group of patients extubated within 12 h postoperatively [6] . Among patients from the latter group, a reduction in DE was also encountered on the 2nd or 3rd post-operative day [6] . However, some differences with respect to the present study should be noted. Excursion measurements were made between forced expiration and maximal inspiration requiring patient's cooperation, whereas we studied patients breathing normally, without effort. This accounts for the difference between a \u2212 40% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion decrease observed in the study by Lerolle et al. [6] and the one found in this study (\u2212 17%). We chose to avoid forced inspiration because the ability to mobilize a vital capacity in the postoperative period is impaired by postoperative pain and is highly variable among patients. This also allowed us to obtain our values by averaging 3 consecutive respiratory cycles, thereby avoiding selection bias.",

Diaphragmatic thickening during inspiration has the theoretical advantage of better reflecting the active contraction of muscle bundles [13] . While this may hold true in mechanically ventilated patients [13] , such difference was not apparent from our study. Moreover, since obtaining appropriate acoustic windows for thickening imaging can be quite difficult and sometimes even impossible (34% failure rate in our cohort), excursion appears as an easier measurement to assess the function of the diaphragm in spontaneously breathing patients. To further compare both methodologies, we undertook a reproducibility sub-study, evaluating excursion and thickening measured twice in the same patients by two different operators. Visual analysis and numerical comparison show that both methods are reproducible, although they seem to suggest that excursion is a more reproducible metric of diaphragm function than thickening. Previous authors found a good reproducibility for each parameter when measured individually [8, 10] .The small disparity we encountered may be a reflection of the difference between the magnitude of excursion (centimeters) and thickening representation of the agreement between paired diaphragmatic thickening fraction measurements obtained by two different operators instead of thickening to assess diaphragmatic function due to the inherent measurement errors with the latter. Our study has a number of strengths. First, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the natural course of diaphragmatic function in consecutive elective cardiac surgery patients using US as the assessment tool. Second, we have described how the diaphragm behaves after planned sternotomy using serial measurements, demonstrating a transient postoperative dysfunction of the main respiratory muscle, even in asymptomatic patients. Third, we have also added to the work of previous authors by demonstrating that such evaluation is both feasible and reproducible in this particular subset of patients.",

Due to unpredictable and uncontrollable external factors, we were unable to collect data from a small number of patients during the 3-month study-period. While we recognize the potential introduction of bias related to missing data, its influence in a study that was not designed to be statistically powered to detect meaningful differences between groups is probably negligible. We did not quantitatively assess the influence of pain (e.g. visual assessment score, analgesic dose) during image acquisition, although any meaningful impact was probably minimized by assuring that all exams were performed during quiet, unassisted breathing. Furthermore, owing to the small size of our population, interpreting the lack of association between variables such as topical hypothermia or COPD and diaphragmatic dysfunction should be made with caution. Finally, we only provide information on patients without respiratory impairment, and therefore cannot extrapolate on the role of diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients with respiratory distress or difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation following cardiac surgery, similarly to what has been proposed by some authors in different clinical settings [14] .",
