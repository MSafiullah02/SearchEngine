Large blood trypanosomes of the subgenus Megatrypanum, followed by small blood forms of the subgenus Schizotrypanum, comprise the majority of the trypanosomes reported in bats throughout South America, Asia, Europe and, especially, Africa [1,3,5,7,8,10-14]. The subgenus Megatrypanum, originally comprising large blood trypanosomes from artiodactyls [15], was amended exclusively on a morphological basis to include any large trypanosome found in bats, monkeys and rodents [1,2,4,6]. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated the polyphyly of the traditional subgenus Megatrypanum, which was revised as a clade comprising trypanosomes from ruminants headed by the type species T. theileri, a cosmopolitan parasite of cattle [16-19]. However, in the reappraisal of this subgenus, other species from non-ruminant hosts that putatively belong to this subgenus need to be phylogenetically positioned, especially those from bats, which together with trypanosomes from artiodactyls, account for most of the species assigned to this subgenus [1,4,7].",

T. rangeli was found in Brazilian bats [26], this species is infective to several mammals and comprises distinct genotypes [26,27], which clustered into a clade containing T. conorhini from rats, T. vespertilionis from a European bat and two African trypanosomes from monkey and civet. Although T. rangeli, T. conorhini and T. vespertilionis were morphologically classified into the subgenera Herpetosoma, Megatrypanum and Schizotrypanum, respectively, molecular phylogenies demonstrated that they clustered together forming the strongly supported sister clade of the Schizotrypanum clade. Trypanosoma sp. (T. sp. bat) from an African megabat (suborder Megachiroptera) originally assigned to the subgenus Megatrypanum was positioned at the edge of this clade [8-10,18,20,23,24].",

The positioning of a kangaroo trypanosome at its edge in association with vicariance has supported the southern supercontinent hypothesis for the origin of T. cruzi. Accordingly, this species could have originated in marsupials at a time when South America, Australia and Antarctica formed a single continent. However, in conflict with this hypothesis, some Australian trypanosomes from marsupials are more related to trypanosomes from non-Australian hosts [9,18,20,21,23,24]. The discovery of African terrestrial mammals infected with trypanosomes placed in the T. cruzi clade [18] has complicated the southern supercontinent hypothesis.",

In this scenario, which is the most parsimonious for explaining the relationships observed within the T. cruzi clade, an ancestral trypanosome parasite in bats diverged to lineages that evolved exclusively in bats, giving rise to the bat-restricted species, or evolved through multiple switches at independent times in hosts of other mammalian orders, including the generalists T. cruzi and T. rangeli, which also infect bats. Multiple trypanosome jumps between hosts were most likely facilitated by the sharing of niches by bats, haematophagous insects (vectors) and terrestrial mammals. Oral infection through the predation of infected bats by other mammals and by the consumption of insect vectors by bats probably played important roles in the colonisation of new hosts by bat trypanosomes. Transmission of trypanosomes among bats is likely to occur by an oral route when the vector insects are eaten by insectivorous bats. The grooming habits of the bats probably facilitates the infection by the bat trypanosomes transmitted by ectoparasite cimicids [3,6,7]. Both vectorial and oral transmission routes are important in the natural transmission cycles of T. cruzi and other trypanosomes nested in the T. cruzi clade [1,3,6-8].",

For the haemoculture, bat blood samples were transferred to tubes containing a medium consisting of solid phase blood agar base (BAB) with an overlay of LIT (liver infusion tryptose) medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS); the tubes were maintained at 25-28\u00b0C for 10\u201315 days. Positive cultures were transferred to culture flasks containing a monolayer of insect cells (Hi-5 from Trichoplusia ni) and epimastigotes from log-phase cultures were then transferred to TC100 medium (= Grace\u2019s medium) containing 10% FBS, with incubation at 25\u00b0C. The utilization of insect feeder cells for the isolation in culture of trypanosomes largely improves the differentiation of blood trypomastigotes to epimastigotes and the multiplication of epimastigotes in primary cultures [10,33,34]. The isolates were grown in TC100 with 5.0% FBS for DNA preparation and cryopreservation at the Trypanosomatid Culture Collection (TCC) of the Department of Parasitology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",

PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the variable V7-V8 region of SSU rRNA (employed as barcodes), whole SSU rRNA and gGAPDH genes were determined as before [35-37]. Sequences were aligned using Clustal X [38] and the resulting alignments were manually refined. We created the following alignments for phylogenetic inferences: a) the V7V8 region of SSU rRNA sequences (~880 bp) from the new bat trypanosomes aligned with their closest Australian and bat trypanosomes, yielding a high similarity index for the new bat trypanosomes by BLAST search; b) gGAPDH sequences (~830 bp) of trypanosomes representing all major clades in the phylogenetic tree of Trypanosoma, using non-trypanosome trypanosomatids as an outgroup; c) concatenated gGAPDH and SSU rRNA sequences (~3.3 kb) from 6 new isolates and several species of T. cruzi clade using T. lewisi as an outgroup. The species included in the phylogenetic trees and their respective host, geographical origin and GenBank accession numbers are shown in Table 1. Phylogenies were inferred by using maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian inferences (BI) and parsimony (P) analyses. Parsimony and bootstrap analyses were carried out using PAUP version 4.0b10 [39] with 500 replicates of a random addition sequence followed by branch swapping (RAS-TBR) as previously described [36,37]. The ML analyses were performed using RAxML v.2.2.3 [40]. Tree searches were performed with GTRGAMMA, with 500 maximum parsimony starting trees. Model parameters were estimated in RAxML for the duration of the tree search. Nodal support was estimated with 500 bootstrap replicates in RAxML using GTRGAMMA and maximum parsimony starting trees. MrBayes v3.1.2 [41] was used for BI inferences as described previously [36,37].",

However, the parasitemia was low and few trypomastigotes could be found in blood smears. Other blood samples from this species and from H. caffer could not be examined by this method because of fieldwork complications. The blood samples from all bats were examined by haemoculture, and cultures of 11 R. landeri isolates and three from H. caffer were established. These new trypanosomes from bats were first cultivated with a monolayer of Hi-5 cells in TC100 medium, and then gradually adapted to TC100 dispersing feeder cells.",

However, multilocus phylogeny validated in this subgenus only the trypanosomes from ruminants allied to T. theileri[16,17,19,45]. With the exception of artiodactyls, bats were the main hosts of trypanosomes morphologically classified in the subgenus Megatrypanum[1,7], so a thorough phylogenetic analysis of bat trypanosomes was required to warrant their exclusion from this subgenus.",

The morphology of T. livingstonei blood and culture forms largely differs from those of the Megatrypanum species. However, epimastigotes of this species developed into large trypomastigotes resembling blood forms under a monolayer of mammalian cells at 37\u00b0C, a process also observed for the Megatrypanum trypanosomes [1,45]. In fact, T. livingstonei blood and culture forms exhibited unique morphological features as shown by light and SEM microscopy. This new species exhibited a cytostome, reservosomes and a disk-shaped kinetoplast, all of which are absent in species of the Megatrypanum and common to those of Schizotrypanum. This is the first study to use TEM and SEM to analyse a bat trypanosome not classified into Schizotrypanum. There are no unambiguous differences in the overall ultrastructural organisation that would be useful for distinguishing T. livingstonei from Schizotrypanum trypanosomes, even though the new species strongly diverged with all molecular markers and in several biological features such as the inability to develop inside mammalian cells and lack of infection in mice and triatomine bugs.",

SL RNA genes have also been used for species identification and genotyping of T. cruzi and T. rangeli[22,26,27,54], T. vivax[55] and T. theileri[17,19]. The characterisation of whole SL gene repeats in T. livingstonei showed a larger length and more polymorphic sequences among isolates of the same species and repeats of the same isolate, when compared to other trypanosome species. In addition, this species enclosed a copy of 5S rRNA within its intergenic region, as reported before for T. vivax, T. conorhini, T. rangeli, T. desterrensis, T. theileri and T. melophagium, but absent in T. cruzi, T. cruzi marinkellei, T. brucei and T. lewisi[17,19,21,44,45,55,56].

These species, which could all be synomies, were reported in bats from Congo, Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania [1,3,7,47].

Bats may have originated in Laurasia (~ 65 MYA), and bat trypanosomes should have diverged since the great diversification/expansion of bats in the Eocene [29-31]. A long past and extensive bat radiation, recent movement of bats across large geographic distances (even large oceanic barriers but not across the Atlantic Ocean), and incomplete bat palaeontology have complicated the studies about the origin and dispersion of bat trypanosomes. Associations between bats and their trypanosomes, and an evaluation of possible paleontological and eco-biogeographical scenarios could account for the origin, genetic diversity, relationships and current distribution of these parasites and are crucial for understanding their evolutionary history.",

This may allow for the description of several new species and the creation of new subgenera to accommodate new species that formed clades without correspondence to any subgenera previously proposed by Hoare [1]. To meet these objectives, new trypanosome cultures should be obtained and deposited in reference collections. The naming of any new trypanosomatid species should be considered valid only when supported by sound and broad phylogenies (using at least SSU rRNA and gGAPDH genes). However, the description of new trypanosome species based on small DNA sequences, accompanied or not by the morphology of blood flagellates (mostly because cultivation have failed), have been accepted [58-60]. We are designating the new African bat isolates as T. livingstonei on the basis of its position in the Trypanosoma phylogenetic trees inferred using SSU rRNA and gGAPDH genes, its genetic distances from other species and also taking into account its peculiar SL RNA gene repeats. Morphological features and information regarding host species, and its behaviour in culture and in mice complement the species description. These data can be valuable for comparative studies of the cellular biology, host-parasite interactions, ecology and evolution of trypanosomes.",

T. livingstonei fell at the edge of the T. cruzi clade, which comprises all bat trypanosomes sampled to date regardless of whether they are from Africa, Europe or South America. The position of T. livingstonei at the base of the T. cruzi clade further supports the hypothesis that the clade was ancestrally a group of bat-restricted parasites that evolved exclusively in these hosts and later jumped at independent times to mammals of other orders. In the most likely scenario, the trypanosomes from several mammalian orders nested into this clade, including those from African and Australian terrestrial mammals, evolved from a bat trypanosome. Other explanations require multiple jumps into bats, which seem less probably. Apparently, this ancestral bat trypanosome gave rise morphologically, biologically (different life cycles and vectors), ecologically and genetically distinct species. The positioning of T. livingstonei in all inferred phylogenies provides evidence that the T. cruzi clade derived from a bat trypanosome, prior to the splits between T. cruzi, T. rangeli and the Australian groups, hence, lends further support to the bat seeding evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of this clade [24]. This study also adds some additional support to T. cruzi itself evolving from a bat trypanosome as the resulting data make more likely that the common ancestor of T. rangeli and T. cruzi was a bat trypanosome.",
