            "text": "The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as an etiologic agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has prompted many groups to develop rapid and accurate molecular assays for the detection of this virus (1)(2)(3)(4). To date, most of the assays have focused predominantly on samples taken from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stools (5)(6). Although detection of SARS-CoV RNA in the plasma of SARS patients has been reported (1), the relatively low sensitivity of the ultracentrifugation-based approach for detecting SARS-CoV RNA in plasma has made this assay impractical. Recently we showed that a one-step real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the polymerase region of the SARS-CoV genome could detect viral RNA in 75\u201378% of nonultracentrifuged serum samples from adult SARS patients during the early stage of disease and that the serum SARS-CoV concentrations on admission were of prognostic significance (7). This finding demonstrates that plasma/serum SARS-CoV quantification may potentially be useful for the early diagnosis of SARS.",

Informed consent was obtained from the patients or their parents, and ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board. The serial blood samples used in this study were collected from the patients during sample collection for routine blood tests for monitoring lymphocyte counts and biochemical indices and enzymes. The convalescent sera of these patients were tested for IgG antibody against SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-infected cells in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (6). All patients were serologically positive for SARS-CoV IgG antibody. As negative controls, blood samples from 15 pediatric patients who suffered from fever and infections other than SARS were collected. The plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in the pediatric patients were compared with the results for adult SARS patients as reported previously (7).",

A RT-PCR system specifically targeting the polymerase gene [orf1ab polyprotein; nt 15327\u201315398; GenBank accession no. AY278554 (10)] of the SARS-CoV genome was designed as described previously (7). The RT-PCRs were set up in a reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL. The primers and fluorescent probe were used at concentrations of 300 and 100 nM, respectively, and 12 \u03bcL of extracted plasma RNA was used for amplification. The thermal profile used for the analysis was as follows: the reaction was initiated at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min for the included uracil N-glycosylase to act, followed by reverse transcription at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. After a 5-min denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of PCR were carried out with denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 20 s and annealing/extension at 56 \u00b0C for 1 min. The sensitivity, linearity, and precision of the assay have been established, as described previously (7). We were able to detect down to 5 copies of the synthetic oligonucleotide in the reaction mixture, which corresponds to 74 copies/mL. SARS-CoV concentrations are expressed as copies/mL of plasma/serum. Because no recovery experiments had been done, the reported concentrations (copies/mL) were minimum estimates. A semilogarithmic plot of different calibrator concentrations against the threshold cycles yielded a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.987. The CV of the copy number of these replicate analyses for this amplification system was 16% at 280 copies/mL (7).",

The assay detected SARS-CoV RNA in the plasma of all patients (100%) at a mean of 7 days (range, 6\u20138 days) after fever onset, representing a mean of 4 days after admission (range, 2\u20136 days), and the median plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration was 483 copies/mL. At a mean of 14 days (range, 12\u201315 days) after fever onset, the detection rate for plasma SARS-CoV dropped to 62.5% (5 of 8), and the median plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration was 103 copies/mL.",

The adult plasma samples were taken at a mean of 4 days after fever onset (range, 2\u20136 days) and exactly 7 days after fever onset. The median adult plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration at a mean of 4 days after fever onset was 125 copies/mL. We observed no significant difference between the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration in the pediatric patients and that in the adult SARS patients (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P = 0.076). In addition, we compared the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration at day 7 after fever onset. The median adult plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration at day 7 was 84 copies/mL. Once again, we observed no significant difference between pediatric and adult SARS patients (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P = 0.076). Because the number of patients in this study was limited, further study involving more patients may be necessary to address the difference of viral loads between adult and pediatric SARS patients.",

These data are largely concordant with our previous data on adult SARS patients showing a high detection rate for serum SARS-CoV RNA within the first week of illness (7).
