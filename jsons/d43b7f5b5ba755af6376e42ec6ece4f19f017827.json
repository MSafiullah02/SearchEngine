Intracellular phosphorylation to the mono, di, and triphosphate derivatives is mediated by host cell enzymes. In both uninfected and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected cells the predominant derivative is the triphosphate, which has an intracellular elimination half life of less than 2 h [76] . Ribavirin triphosphate is generally the predominant metabolite [76] . 246 Ergonul et al. The broad spectrum antiviral activity of ribavirin can potentially be attributed to its multiple mechanisms of action. As a purine analog, it can function in multiple cellular and viral processes. An important aspect of the antiviral activity of ribavirin may stem from the ability to act via multiple mechanisms simultaneously [43] . Five distinct mechanisms were suggested. Some of these actions potentiate others [49] . Ribavirin monophosphate competitively inhibits cellular inosine-5\u2032-phosphate dehydrogenase and interferes with the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and thus nucleic acid synthesis in general. Ribavirin triphosphate also competitively inhibits the GTP dependent 5\u2032-capping of viral messenger RNA. Ribavirin is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an inhibitor of RNA capping, a polymerase inhibitor, a lethal mutagen, and an immunomodulatory agent [43] .",

In the first clinical report in 1995, the observation was limited to three health-care workers (HCW), who had been infected with CCHFV infection [33] . All three patients were severely ill with low platelet and white blood cell counts, raised aspartate transaminase, and evidence of impaired haemostasis. According to severity criteria defined by Swanepoel [95] , all had an estimated probability of death of 90% or more. The patients became afebrile, and their haematological and biochemical abnormalities returned to normal within 48 h of ribavirin treatment, and all made a complete recovery. This finding was found to be encouraging for the use of ribavirin in CCHFV infections, but did not constitute evidence of efficacy.

The lack of randomization is the main criticism for these observational studies. However, sometimes the observational studies could give qualified information, if they could be well designed [101] . But, the researchers should be aware of the potential confounders. While performing the clinical outcome studies on ribavirin use in CCHF, there are significant confounders; 1. Severity of the infection might differ. There are mild and severe forms of the disease, because of several reasons. (see also Chapter 16). 2. Number of days from onset might differ. Some patients could get the ribavirin at an earlier, prehemorrhagic phase of the infection, whereas some patients could get the ribavirin at a later phase, hemorrhagic phase of the infection. 3. The severity of the gastrointestinal symptoms might differ. Some patients cannot get drug via oral route, because of severe hematemesis. This parameter is important in pharmacological effectivity. If the ribavirin was saved for the severe cases, an observational comparative study between the ribavirin given and not given group would have a misclassification bias in favor of not using ribavirin. The patients who would not receive ribavirin would be usually the mild cases. A well designed observational study should minimize the effect of these confounders to avoid the misclassification bias.",

Apheresis platelets have a shelf life ranging from 24 h to 5 days and are stored at room temperature. These products account for most platelet transfusions in the developed countries. HLA-matched platelet concentrates: If the donor of an apheresis platelet concentrate is selected because the donor's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type is matched to the recipient's HLA type (due to the development of alloimmunization to HLA), the apheresis platelet product is considered to be an HLA-matched platelet component. Use of platelet transfusions is indicated to control active bleeding or to prevent hemorrhage associated with a deficiency in platelet number or function. Platelets are used prophylactically to prevent bleeding when the platelet count is less than 10,000-20,000/\u00b5L. There is a growing trend to reduce the prophylactic platelet transfusion \"trigger\" to counts as low as 5,000-10,000/\u00b5L in stable patients without significant hemorrhage [69] . Dose and infusion rate: RDPs The average adult platelet concentrate dose is one unit of RDP per 12 kg of body weight. There is a growing trend in the United States to define a standard \"dose\" of platelet concentrates. This standard varies among different institutions from 4 U, 6 U, or 8 U of platelet concentrates to be infused per transfusion episode. Platelet units usually are pooled into one bag by the transfusion service prior to issue. They should be infused within 4 h at a rate that depends on the patient's ability to tolerate the volume. RDPs may be \"volume reduced; that is, the pooled RDPs undergo centrifugation that allows separation of platelets from the platelet poor plasma. Excess platelet poor plasma is removed, and the therapeutic dose then is concentrated into approximately 100 mL. Volume-reduced platelets are infused more rapidly than nonvolume-reduced platelets and must be infused within 4 h of pooling [69] . Pheresis platelet-SDPs. One SDP concentrate is considered a therapeutic dose, equivalent to six units of RDP. SDPs should be infused as rapidly as possible, depending on the patient's ability to tolerate the infused volume.

As a general rule, platelet counts should be obtained 18-24 h post-infusion. The average-sized adult who receives 1 U of RDP per 12 kg of body weight or one SDP dose should have a posttransfusion platelet increment of 30,000-50,000 \u00b5L. Patients who have smaller or no increment at 18-24 h post-infusion should have platelet counts performed 10-60 min after the next platelet transfusion. If the 10 to 60 min posttransfusion increment is minimal or not increased at all, the possibility of refractoriness caused by alloimmunization should be entertained. Antibody-related platelet destruction is often related to the development of HLA-specific antibodies in response to foreign donor HLA antigens [79] . The patient then should be considered for HLA-matched platelet transfusions or crossmatched platelet concentrates. Poor posttransfusion platelet survival, in addition to being caused by alloimmunization, is often seen in conjunction with fever, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and others. Patients in these settings are considered to be refractory on a nonimmunologic basis and are not expected to benefit from HLA-matched platelet transfusions. Patients who have life-threatening hemorrhage may require larger platelet doses to be therapeutic. Currently, controversy is growing as to whether patients requiring prophylactic platelet transfusions would benefit more from repetitive small-dose platelet transfusions or be better off using extra high-dose platelet transfusions. Randomized, well-controlled studies to answer this issue have not yet been done [69] .",

This may lead to an improvement in therapy; an example could be the finding of inhibitors of the viral protein processing. During the last decade, the potential of RNA interference as a therapeutic agent against virus infection has been discussed. Recently many studies have displayed the efficacy of chemically synthesized short interference RNA as a tool to combat a diverse group of viruses. However it should be mentioned that before RNA interference can be used as therapeutic agents several questions need to be addressed, such as: (1) the transient effect of short interference RNA, (2) delivery methods, and (3) cell uptake [15] .",

The type I interferons includes interferon-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03bb [12, 87] . There are at least 14 subtypes of interferon-\u03b1 genes, but only one \u03b2 and \u03bb gene. All type I interferons have antiviral activity as well as antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. Virus-infected or stimulated cells upregulate and secretes interferon type I. The secreted interferons induce other cells to express potent antiviral proteins and to activate additional antiviral mechanisms that will limit the viral spread. The antiviral activity of interferon-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 is not directly coupled to the interferon molecule per se.

MxA belongs to the dynamin super family of large GTPases, whose members function in a variety of intracellular transport process. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that MxA has a significant antiviral activity against CCHFV [3, 4] . Andersson and coworkers demonstrated that MxA colocalizes and interacts with CCHFV nucleocapsid protein in the perinuclear region of infected cells; it was therefore suggested that this interaction inhibits the virus replication process. Similar results have been observed for other members of Bunyaviridae [37, 64, 81] . These results together imply that all animal bunyaviridae may be restricted in their intracellular growth by MxA, and probably by the same mechanism.",

            "text": "Infections with CCHFV elicit antibodies to the virus that are not present several (about 5-9) days after onset of illness [78, 88] . Patients who have died of CCHF do not usually develop a measurable antibody response [78] . It is likely that even if such patients did have low levels of CCHFV-specific IgG they still could be reinfected. For example, it was shown for West African sheep, which play a central role in the maintenance cycle of CCHF virus in disease-endemic areas because they serve as host for both the virus and the tick vector, that even sheep that were infected previously and had anti-CCHF virus IgG can be reinfected and transmit the virus [42, 106] . CCHFV-specific IgM remains elevated for 40 days after infection [42] but there are no reports whether such elevated levels could protect from infection or reinfection. However, such antibodies could play a protective role in secondary transmissions. The virulence of the virus is likely diminished in such transmissions possibly due to existence of subpopulations of virus adapted to a host that are selected after passage through another vertebrate host; such subpopulations seem to be less virulent and might have an altered capacity of transmission [41] . This is consistent with the observation that infectivity from secondary cases is unusual [94] unless heavy exposure to virus contaminated tissue has occurred [1, 73, 77] . However, the efficacy of treatment in such secondary transmissions is difficult to evaluate because of lack of controls and because the risk for fatal outcome of the secondary case is not so high. There is currently no specific antiviral therapy for CCHF approved for use in humans by the FDA. A formalin-inactivated suckling mouse brain-based vaccine has been used in Bulgaria and other parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union for protection from CCHFV infections. In the Rostov region of the former Soviet Union, 1,500 persons received the vaccine and showed a high frequency of detectable antibodies. Likewise, vaccine was given to several hundred human volunteers in Bulgaria, with resulting high antibody induction. With the relatively small target population of persons at risk for contracting CCHFV, the large-scale development and production of a CCHF vaccine by modern standards seems unlikely.",

In more recent times, Bulgarian investigators suggested that immunotherapy treatment of seven patients with severe CCHF via passive simultaneous transfer of two different specific immunoglobulin preparations, CCHF-bulin (for intramuscular use) and CCHFvenin (for intravenous use), prepared from the plasma of CCHF survivor donors boosted with one dose of CCHF vaccine, resulted in quick recovery of all patients [102] . No side effects were observed and the patients were discharged in good health. Although there was no control group of cases of the same severity (an average of 25 cases per year are reported in Bulgaria), and firm evidence of its value is lacking, previous experience suggested that in such cases the prognosis is unfavorable even when the patients are treated with the intramuscular formulation (CCHF-bulin) -for 4 years (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) 15 such patients have died. The investigators attributed the success of this approach to the quick distribution of the antibodies through the circulation that is important for acute infections combined with a sustained and even increasing antibody concentration from the muscle depot. They suggested that the intravenous preparation be used for treatment of all cases of CCHF.",

            "text": "Advances in development of monoclonal antibodies and antibody engineering have raised hopes for new candidate drugs for prevention and treatment of CCHFV infections. Immunotherapy of CCHF has been based on polyclonlal antibodies obtained from serum of immunized animals or humans. Although such preparations could be effective, the use of monoclonal antibodies could allow better control of the composition of the therapeutic preparations and in some cases could be more effective. For example, the humanized monoclonal antibody Synagis, which is the first and only monoclonal antibody yet licensed for an infectious disease, is the preferred of the two available licensed products in most situations (the second one is the RSV-IGIV, RespiGam, which is a solution of IgG enriched in neutralizing antibodies to RSV). However, the mAbs recognize a single epitope that may limit their usefulness against pathogens that exhibit genetic variations [16] . This problem could be solved by generating mAbs against conserved epitopes and/or use of mAb cocktails [16, 24] .",

In neutralization assays on SW-13 cells, mmAbs to G C , but not to G N , prevented CCHFV infection. However, only a subset of G C mmAbs protected mice in passiveimmunization experiments, while some non-neutralizing G N mmAbs efficiently protected animals from a lethal CCHFV challenge. Thus, neutralization of CCHFV likely depends not only on the properties of the antibody, but on host cell factors as well. In addition, non-neutralizing antibody-dependent mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, may be involved in the in vivo protection seen with some of the mmAbs.",

Humanization decreases but does not eliminate the possibility for immunogenic effects and in some cases is difficult to do. We have initiated an experimental program aimed at the development of fully human mAbs (hmAbs) that recognize G N and G C and neutralize the virus by using our phage display libraries. G N and G C mediate the virus entry into susceptible cells, and have been recently expressed and characterized as membrane-associated proteins [13, 84, 103] . Currently there are no available human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) directed to epitopes on G N and G C . We plan to use two different procedures for Env expression from non-infectious material and presentation in native conformations: (i) mammalian cell surface associated functional Envs, and (ii) recombinant expressed soluble Envs. Production of Envs in close to native conformation is of critical importance, for in many instances the ability to elicit potent neutralizing activity to oligomeric Envs depends on the retention of their native three-dimensional structure. As our second method for presentation of Env antigens, we use recombinant soluble Envs we have been developing. The ability to produce soluble forms of such glycoproteins using recombinant mammalian expression systems often allows for production of the protein in a form that is unperturbed in tertiary and quaternary structure. For example, viral Envs are invariably oligomeric, composed of homo or heterotrimeric or tetrameric forms, and the systems using high expression vectors and tissue culture often allows for rapid production of such native oligomeric versions of these types of proteins. Such soluble constructs can be more easily purified and they are quite useful in analyzing the structure and oligomeric nature of the proteins. Thus significant amounts of purified soluble Envs from all these viruses will be available for screening of PDLs.",

We and others have successfully used these protocols for identification of hmAbs directed against epitopes on the HIV Env [72, [110] [111] [112] . Recently, we developed a novel methodology, sequential antigen panning (SAP), based on alternating various Envs during panning of PDLs, which was used to identify four new potent broadly HIV-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody Fabs (m12,14,16,18) [109] . We plan to use the SAP methodology for the Envs. If there are conserved neutralization epitopes on these viruses and the SAP approach is successful, we could obtain a hmAb(s) that is effective against several or all isolates in addition to nhmAbs specific to individual isolates. In preliminary experiments we identified three hmAbs that bind specifically to the Envs expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus and are being characterized for neutralizing activity by our collaborator R. Flick and epitope mapping (Zhu et al., in preparation).",
