Patients must be fully involved in the decision-making process prior to any procedure being performed. [1] Prior to a patient undergoing any procedure informed consent must be obtained from the patient. The process of informed consent should include (1) describing the proposed intervention, (2) emphasizing the patient's role in decision-making, (3) discussing alternatives to the proposed intervention, (4) discussing the risks of the proposed intervention and (5) eliciting the patient's preference (usually by signature). [2] During this process, the patient must be educated on the risks, benefits, and alternatives of any given procedure or intervention and understand the information put forth. It is important that the patient understand the consequences of not undergoing the procedure to include no relief of pain and potential worsening of their disease. Obtaining Informed consent is both an ethical and legal obligation of any medical practitioners in the United States and originates from the patient's right to direct what happens to his/her body. [2] In general, patients that are more susceptible to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) according to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) include:",

Typically steroid injections are used for a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, gout, bursitis, tendinitis, joint pain, plantar fasciitis, sciatica, or chronic low back pain. Prednisone/corticosteroid injections can offer fast-acting relief of inflamed muscles, joints, tendons, and bursa, which leads to a decrease in pain. In radiology, patients with chronic pain frequently undergo procedures which include the injection of prednisone/corticosteroids (such as methylprednisolone or triamcinolone). Prednisone/corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory agents that slow down the accumulation of cells responsible for producing inflammation. Steroids are frequently injected during pain procedures with the intention of easing pain, increasing a patient's mobility and quality of life. Procedures that require the injection of prednisone/corticosteroids which are performed in radiology, orthopedic practices, pain management as well as other practices, may include joint injections of the shoulder, knee, hip, elbow, epidural steroid injection of the cervical or lumbar spine.",

Prednisone/corticosteroids have been shown to cause a variable degree of adrenal suppression for at least a few weeks as well as an altered immune response making them more susceptible to infection. There is a possible reduction in the immune response for up to a few weeks following the procedure. Each case is unique, and no management will cover all possibilities. Caution should be used when assessing patients for prednisone/corticosteroids injections balancing the severity of their underlying disease/comorbidities, the potential benefit and the risks including immunocompromise, and the additional risk should the patient have or become infected in the period after injection when there is likely to be an ongoing effect on the immunological system. Patients should be fully aware of the potential increased risk, the lack of clear evidence and be engaged in decision making. Likewise, practitioners should consider the risk benefits balance of such injections and under which circumstances they will continue to provide the injections in the current environment.",

We at Middletown Orthopedics want to inform our patients of the potential side effects of the injection of steroids and the measures to protect yourself against serious illness. This is particularly important to understand right now considering the current COVID-19.The procedure you are about to have is an epidural steroid injection that involves the injection of prednisone or corticosteroids. A common side effect of corticosteroids like prednisone is increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression. This can occur even with relatively small amounts injected into the epidural space. Immunocompromised (sometimes referred to as \"immunosuppressed\") means you have a weakened immune system. For one reason or another, an immunocompromised person cannot fight infections as well as people with a healthy immune system.The risks of rare but serious infections must be weighed with the expected benefits of pain relief and functional improvement from epidural steroid injections.You can protect yourself after the procedure from developing infection by following the CDC guidelines to protect yourself from the Coronavirus:\u2022 Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\u2022 Sneezing and coughing into the fold of your elbow \u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\u2022 Avoid touching people who may be ill \u2022 Disinfect/sanitize surfaces regularly \u2022 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.I understand the above information and agree to have the stated procedure. ",
