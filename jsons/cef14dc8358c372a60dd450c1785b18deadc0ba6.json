These infections cause significant economic burden, with estimated direct and indirect medical costs in the US exceeding $70 billion annually [2, 3] . Children under the age of 5 have an average incidence rate of four to six viral respiratory infections/year and the rate gradually decreases to one to two/year in most adults [4] .",

Ineffective treatments for children include both inhaled and oral corticosteroids and Echinacea. Among adults, decongestants, antihistamine/decongestant combinations, and intranasal ipratropium have been shown to improve cold symptoms [17, 18] . Additionally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to relieve discomfort due to colds but not to improve respiratory symptoms [19] . When taken within 24 h of symptom onset, zinc has been shown to reduce the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy adults [20] . Echinacea plant preparations have not proven effective in treating common colds among adults [21] . In supplementation trials, regular use of vitamin C did not decrease the incidence of common colds, but did have a positive effect on symptom duration and severity. Therapeutic trials of vitamin C during a cold have not shown a significant effect on common cold symptom reduction, but it may be worth considering in individual cases given its favorable safety profile and low cost [22] .",

The LAIV is recommended over the IIV for children ages 2-8 when immediately available if the child has no contraindications to the live attenuated vaccine. When vaccine supply is limited, preference should be given to those at higher risk, including children age 6-59 months, adults >50 years of age, those with immunosuppression or other severe chronic disease including morbid obesity, women who are or will become pregnant during the influenza season, residents of long-term care facilities, and Native Americans/Native Alaskans [32] .

Influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus have all been identified, though in the majority of cases no causative agent is isolated [41] . Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumonia cause acute bronchitis in approximately 5-10 % of adult cases [40] . Though pneumonia-causing pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis are sometimes isolated from patients with acute bronchitis, their role is unclear and they do not appear to be etiologic agents of bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults [40, 41] .",
