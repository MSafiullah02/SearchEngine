One of the most exciting discoveries is that the innate host defense system consists not only of mobile and versatile immune cells such as DCs, macrophages, ILCs, and unconventional T cells but also of a large variety of resident sessile cells. Resident innate immune cells are predominantly located at the interface between the environment and the host, where pathogens can enter the body. There are several types of sessile cells: innate defense responses use mucosal EpCs such as bronchial, intestinal, tubular, gastric, pancreatic, and uterine EpCs as well as vascular cells such as ECs and VSMCs. Also, other cells types such as adipocytes and osteoblasts are found in the innate immune system. A few different cell types, as extracted from the rapidly growing literature, are presented in the following.",

Of importance are mucosal surfaces prone to contact with pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes, which requires that immune recognition principles have to be tightly controlled to avoid uncontrolled permanent activation. To be an effective physical first barrier of defense against invading infectious pathogens, EpCs, all intensely equipped with PRMs such as TLRs and NLRs, have evolved innate immune antimicrobial functions able to secrete local antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins [1] (for antimicrobial peptides, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_23).",

In fact, there is growing evidence suggesting that innate immune mechanisms in cells of the oral mucosa represent an effective first-line defense against pathogens that enter and contaminate the oral cavity on a daily basis. Gingival epithelium accounts for a robust innate immune defense system that works in many ways for the protection of underlying connective tissue. First, it provides a physical barrier which does not allow microbes to invade while enabling selective transaction with the oral environment. Second, upon interaction with microbes, it secretes cytokines as well as chemokines to activate the influx of neutrophils and other immune cells into the sulcular area [11, 12]. Third, the gingival epithelium has been found to be a source of antimicrobial peptides which are crucial for an effective innate immune humoral defense response [13]. Cells of the gingival epithelium are equipped with various PRMs including TLRs [12, 14] and NLRs such as NLRP3 that forms the inflammasome [15, 16]. Again, when uncontrolled, MAMP/DAMP-induced, PRM-mediated innate immune responses of cells of the oral cavity may cause pathologies in the form of gingivitis and periodontitis which may result in chronic periodontal diseases [17].",

Of particular relevance is the NLRP3 receptor that upon activation by DAMPs is capable of forming an inflammasome, thereby contributing to lung inflammation. For example, novel data have shown the presence and functional activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the DAMP cristobalite silica in human lung EpCs that may contribute to lung diseases [23] (for silica particles as exogenous DAMPs, see Part IV, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_15).

The mucosa is lined with highly polarized epithelial absorptive cells with their apical plasma membrane domain facing the lumen while the basolateral surfaces are associating with lamina propria where professional immune cells reside. A small population of intestinal epithelial stem cells is located at the bottom of crypts, from which functionally distinct epithelial cell types differentiate and mature. These cells operate as critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration [29, 30].",

This occurs during acute kidney injury (AKI) together with renal cell necrosis (e.g., in thrombotic microangiopathy, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or acute tubular necrosis {ATN}). In addition, inflammation is present in autoimmune and alloimmune kidney injury which includes all forms of glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and allograft rejection [56]. In this context, it is worth noting already here that there is a kidney-specific molecule, namely Tamm-Horsfall protein/uromodulin, that acts as a renal DAMP. Uromodulin is selectively produced by the cells of the thick ascending limb and secreted into the distal tubule.

To maintain the growth of commensal organisms on their external surface and defending the underlying tissues from invading pathogens, EpCs of the female genital tract have evolved innate immune antimicrobial functions as well as the capability to modulate the recruitment and activity of immune cells of both immune systems. In fact, PRM-bearing cervico-vaginal EpCs reportedly respond to MAMPs and/or DAMPs and produce an array of innate immune factors such as complement, pro-inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and antiviral factors which allow these cells to communicate with the immune system [60\u201362]. Indeed, several studies have shown that uterine and cervico-vaginal EpCs\u2014besides macrophages and DCs\u2014execute immunological functions by expressing PRMs such as TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs. However, the mechanism by which these cells work together is still limited [63\u201365].

They are significant contributors to innate mucosal immunity and generate various sophisticated antimicrobial defense mechanisms including the formation of a tight barrier and the secretion of antimicrobial substances. EpCs functionally express multiple PRMs to provide these active defense mechanisms. Notably, mucosal surfaces are prone to contact with pathogenic as well as commensal non-pathogenic microbes, and therefore, immune recognition principles must be strictly regulated to avoid uncontrolled permanent activation. Indeed, these balancing mechanisms are probably due to the pathogen-induced emission of DAMPs which are recognized by EpCs together with MAMPs on the one hand and a result of MAMP recognition alone in the presence of commensals on the other hand. But this has to be proven in future experiments. As also stressed elsewhere [66], deciphering these mechanisms will provide essential understanding to how mucosal tissues maintain health and activate immunity, as well as how pathogens promote disease.",

Typically, fibroblasts synthesize most of the ECM of connective tissues, including interstitial collagens, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, that is, compounds and molecules that are needed to maintain a structural framework for many tissues. Of note, persistently activated fibroblasts are called myofibroblasts (phenotypically characterized by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin {\u03b1-SMA}) that mediate the excessive secretion of collagen in chronically injured organs and tissues.

This view has been challenged by data illustrating extensive phenotypic heterogeneity among fibroblasts from different tissues and a given tissue under various physiologic conditions. For example, as reviewed [69], lung fibroblasts have been demonstrated to be heterogeneous in cell surface marker expression as well as in their levels of collagen production. Cardiac fibroblasts were shown to be well-established as key regulators of ECM turnover in the context of myocardial remodelling and fibrosis. Also, periodontal fibroblasts also are characterized by heterogeneity based on morphology, glycogen pools, and collagen production. Further, fibroblasts from different anatomic sites have been found to possess distinct transcriptional patterns. Under appropriate stimulation, for example, mediated by DAMPs, quiescent fibroblasts can acquire an active synthetic, contractile phenotype and express several SMC markers (i.e., myofibroblasts) which are not exclusive to fibroblasts. On the other hand, human hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts show the biologic characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells [69, 70].",

Traditionally, fibroblasts are defined as local resident cells of mesenchymal origin. The mesenchymal cells that form the fibroblast population are believed to be derived from a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This transition process is a form of cell plasticity in which EpCs lose their special molecular markers and acquire mesenchymal phenotypes associated with expression of proteins of fibroblasts [70, 71]. A similar process, called endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has also been reported. The EndMT is a fundamental cellular mechanism that regulates embryonic development and diseases such as cancer and fibrosis. Recent developments in biomedical research have shown remarkable potential to harness the EMT process for tissue engineering and regeneration [72, 73]. In addition, another source of fibroblasts refers to circulating fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes that are derived from bone marrow stem cells [74]. Finally, so-called pericytes have been suggested to contribute to the adult interstitial fibroblast population able to synthesize collagen as well [75].\n",

Moreover, investigations on human gingival fibroblasts revealed clear mRNA expression of TLRs and NLRs which were found to be activated by chemically synthesized agonists mimicking microbial products for these receptors [79]. Also of interest in this context are studies on synovial fibroblasts that showed the DAMP HMGB1 mixed with the MAMP LPS to synergistically up-regulate TLR4 and RAGE expression on the surface of these cells [80].",

As executed at various locations of the body, phagocytosing vascular macrophages can participate in debris removal and efferocytosis (see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22), and evidence has been presented that they can mediate cytotoxic functions in the vessel wall as well. Notably, defective efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis is regarded as a significant promoter of atherosclerotic plaques progression [121]. Importantly, there is another mechanism of atherosclerosis progression: macrophages engulf the deposited normal and modified lipoproteins, transforming them into cholesterol-laden foam cells. Foam cells, known as characteristic cells involved in atherosclerosis, persist in plaques and promote disease progression through several mechanisms including contribution to plaque instability [127].",

Sessile resident vascular DCs have been observed in the intima of atherosclerosis-prone vascular regions exposed to disturbed blood flow patterns. In experiments on mice, several phenotypically and functionally distinct vascular DC subsets including cDCs and pDCs have been described [128]. Similar to mice, in humans, DCs can be detected in the arterial intima of healthy young individuals, and increased numbers of DCs have been observed in atherosclerotic lesions [129]. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the different DC subsets awaits further investigations. Human vascular DCs are mainly found in the plaque shoulder and rupture-prone regions as well as in marginal parts of the plaque core. The majority of DCs in advanced plaques appears to be activated as revealed by the expression of costimulatory molecules which allow them to stimulate autoreactive T cells [129].

Ironically, when the vascular insults turn out to be too severe or occur chronic-repetitively and persistently, this primarily beneficial protective function of vascular cells shifts to the contrary, namely, chronic inflammation associated with overshooting repair mechanisms (VSMC proliferation!), which drive life-threatening atherosclerotic processes. In fact, atherosclerosis as a chronic disease is characterized by two fundamental hallmarks: innate immune-mediated inflammation and lipid retention. Accumulating evidence suggests that ECs, VSMCs, adventitial cells, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014vascular DCs and macrophages are predominantly involved in atherogenesis. Pattern recognition molecules such as TLRs, NLRs, and RLHs have been identified as an essential link between the immune system and cardiovascular disease development. In fact, there is rapidly growing evidence indicating that DAMPs \u2194 PRMs interactions contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis and its concomitant diseases. Although much has been discovered about TLR activation in cellular components of the cardiovascular system, the roles that individual members of the TLR, NLR, and RLH family have in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases and associated clinical practice remain undefined.

Pathological bone loss occurs when this homeostatic relationship is disturbed.

They are characterized by production and maintenance of the cartilaginous matrix, which consists to a large extent of collagen and proteoglycans. In vivo, it has to resist to very high compressive loads, and that is explicable in terms of the physico-chemical properties of cartilage-specific macromolecules and with the movement of water and ions within the matrix [133, 134]. Chronic mechanical injury or excessive levels of ROS may damage chondrocytes or even result in their death associated with the release of DAMPs [135, 136]. So it is not surprising that these cells are also equipped with various PRMs including TLRs that can sense DAMPs to initiate inflammatory responses [136, 137]. In fact, mature chondrocytes express TLR1 and TLR2 and may react to cartilage matrix/chondrocyte-derived DAMPs. This interaction may lead to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines which stimulate further TLRs and expression of inducible DAMPs such as cytokines, thereby establishing a vicious circle. Apart from a role of TLRs, there is first evidence suggesting that the recognition receptor RAGE when stimulated by the DAMP S100A4 (for S100 proteins, also compare Part IV, Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_12 and 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_14) can activate human articular chondrocytes, thereby promoting joint inflammation [138, 139].",

As mentioned above, as vital bone-resorbing cells, they play a pivotal role in skeletal development and adult bone remodelling. They also participate in the pathogenesis of various human bone diseases. Osteoclasts differentiate from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation of two essential factors, the M-CSF and receptor activation of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) [146]. The close relationship of osteoclast function to responses of the innate immune system has already been recognized. Thus, there is growing evidence suggesting that DAMP-induced activation of PRM-bearing cells of the innate immune system may be involved in osteoclast formation [147, 148]. In particular, DAMP-triggered activation of TLR5 has been shown to activate RANKL and osteoclast formation and therefore represents a potential key factor in inflammation-induced bone erosions in diseases like RA, reactive arthritis, and periodontitis [149]. These data are of interest regarding the observation that TLR5 can be activated by endogenous ligands produced in inflamed RA synovium and, thus, may reflect a first clue that TLR5 may play a crucial role in inflammatory bone loss seen in a wide range of autoimmune and infectious diseases [149, 150].",

White adipose tissue, composed of adipocytes that are held together by a poorly vascularized and innervated connective tissue, stores dietary energy in a highly concentrated form as triglyceride, mostly in a single large lipid droplet. In periods of caloric need, these triglycerides can be rapidly hydrolyzed by lipases (a process known as lipolysis), and the resulting free fatty acids are then released and transported to other tissues to be oxidized in mitochondria as an energy source. However, the WAT is not only a site of an energy reservoir but also acts as an active metabolic organ that can secrete specific bioactive molecules that have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions. Some of these secreted molecules function as a variety of adipokines as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins (e.g., TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and adiponectin and IL-10, respectively) [155\u2013158].",

Brown adipocytes in BAT are packed with mitochondria (determining the brownish color) that contain uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This protein, when activated, short-circuits the electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis, thereby stimulating respiratory chain activity [157, 158].",

Studies have reported the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in subsets of adipocytes, and LPS has been shown to signal through TLR4 (although not increasing its expression) and induce IL-6 and TNF secretion [165]. Also, it could be demonstrated that TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 protein co-localized with adiponectin in human adipocytes, with TLR4 exhibiting the highest immunohistochemical expression [159\u2013161]. It is also worthwhile to briefly mention here that the dual activation of TLR4 in adipocytes by LPS and fatty acids represents a molecular gate that connects innate immunity with metabolism [153]. Potential DAMPs in adipose tissue released by dying adipocytes or individual lipids are thus present in increased concentrations in obesity [162]. It is therefore of high interest to identify what PRRs mediate the link between obesity and adipose tissue inflammation. In sum, accumulating evidence indicates that obesity is closely associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

            "text": "As our knowledge about the function of PRM-bearing cells of the innate immune system continues to grow, it becomes increasingly more apparent that we have to redefine what we mean by immune defense. Previously, the term \u201cimmune cells\u201d was restricted to mobile and versatile cells such as DCs, macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes; however, presently, we are learning about an entire family of cells with different functions. We may distinguish cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, mobile circulating cells, sessile cells, resident tissue cells, and so on. Ultimately, a whole organism\u2014a body\u2014is designed as a \u201cdefense machinery\u201d with different body parts and tissues having distinct functions and exerting different mechanisms of defense. In this context, Matzinger [163] concludes: \u201cIn their own defense, tissues send a panoply of signals that initiate immunity and guide the choice of effector class. Th1-Th2 and Treg is far too simple a representation of the breathtaking variety of the resulting responses.\u201d Moreover, all those innate immune cells are committed to rapidly recognizing both infective and sterile inciting insults, aimed at mediating essential mechanisms of elimination of the inciting agent (e.g., pathogens) as well as\u2014if necessary\u2014facilitating and preparing subsequent acquired/adaptive immune responses. As also discussed elsewhere [164], numerous intricate interactions among the various innate cells take place that finally guarantee protective immunity. Thus, rather than acting as isolated sensory and effector cells, innate immune cells are in constant communication and collaboration with each other, locally and distally. These interactions are critically important for the efficient control of both infectious and sterile injuries.",
