[1] [2] [3] During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, HCWs were reported to account for 20% of critically ill SARS cases. [4] The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the recent Ebola outbreak have further amplified the concerns of HCWs for adequate respiratory protection equipment (RPE). The most common RPE used by HCWs are surgical masks and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). [5, 6] However, surgical masks are not able to provide barrier to sub-micrometer-size bioaerosols, [7, 8] while N95 class filters are associated with high breathing resistance, which may be the reason for 1/3 of HCWs' headaches during long-term use of N95 FFRs. [9] In addition, annual fit-testing is required for N95 FFRs since face seal leakage would significantly affect the achieved protection. [10, 11] The finding that HCWs were infected with SARS despite the use of N95 FFRs gave rise to the interest in using powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) for outbreaks of highly contagious pathogens. [12, 13] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines a PAPR as \"an air-purifying respirator that uses a blower to force the ambient air through air-purifying elements to the inlet covering.\" [14] Compared to N95 FFRs, PAPRs feature several advantages to the wearers. Firstly, PAPRs offer higher assigned protection factors (APF) ranging from 25 (loose-fitting PAPRs) to 1,000 (full facepiece tightfitting PAPRs), whereas the APF for N95 FFRs is 10. [14] Other significant advantages of using PAPRs are the decreased breathing effort and the cooling effect on the face. In addition, loose-fitting PAPRs do not require annual fit-testing and can be used by HCWs who cannot achieve a good fit with N95 FFRs due to facial hair or other factors. [15] Given that a loose-fitting PAPR is not designed to completely seal to the face or neck, if inspiratory flow exceeds the airflow delivered by the blower (over breathing), unfiltered air may leak in. [16] It was found that with increasing inspiratory flow, the manikin fit factors for a loose-fitting PAPR decreased exponentially. [17] Therefore, the determination of minimum operational flow is crucial for a loose-fitting PAPR. PAPRs were originally developed to protect various industrial workers from workplace airborne hazards. [3] The minimum air flow rates for NIOSH-approved tight-fitting and loosefitting PAPRs are 115 L/min and 170 L/min, respectively. [14] These testing flow rates were mainly obtained from industrial workplaces, primarily mining. [18, 19] Industrial settings often require workers to perform moderate to high effort job activities, [20] therefore PAPRs used in those conditions must provide sufficient air flows to satisfy the breathing demands for the workers. However, the workplace environments experienced by HCWs differ significantly from the industrial conditions, especially pertaining to physical exertion when performing routine work activities. [21] Currently, there are no scientific studies conducted on the respiratory flow required by HCWs using PAPRs, and no national or international standards are available regarding the minimum operational flow for PAPRs used by HCWs. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the breathing characteristics of one group of HCWs (hospital cleaning staff) in order to determine the minimum operational flow required for operating loosefitting PAPRs. The methods developed in this pilot study can be easily used to characterize breathing flow for all other HCW groups. The results obtained from this study may assist in improving the scientific basis for future updates to NIOSH PAPR standards.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 146, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 151, "end": 154, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 296, "end": 299, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 634, "end": 636, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 729, "end": 732, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 733, "end": 735, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1033, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1242, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2000, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2203, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2334, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2535, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2666, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2759, "end": 2763, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2767, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2865, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3184, "end": 3188, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An innovative portable respiratory flow recording device (Safety Equipment Australia [SEA] Pty Ltd., Australia) was employed in this field study.
