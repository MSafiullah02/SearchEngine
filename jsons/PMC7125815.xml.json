According to the paradigm of Mosmann et al,68 undifferentiated or naive T helper cells, TH0 cells, under appropriate conditions, may differentiate along distinct pathways to become either TH1 or TH2 lymphocytes.

            "text": "The major function for differentiated TH1 cells is regulation of cell-mediated defense against tumor cells and infections, particularly defense against viral, fungal, mycobacterial, and intracellular pathogens. The most significant cytokine elaborated by differentiated TH1 cells is interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). This cytokine stimulates microbicidal activities of phagocytes, increases class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression, activates neutrophils, stimulates cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and activates vascular endothelial cells, thereby promoting T lymphocyte adhesion and extravasation. Importantly, IFN-\u03b3 promotes CD4+ T-cell differentiation to the TH1 subtype and inhibits differentiation of TH2 cells, promoting TH1 dominance. Thus, the net effect of IFN-\u03b3 production is the promotion of macrophage-rich inflammatory reactions, and inhibition of IgE-dependent, eosinophil-mediated reactions. TH1 cells also produce interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine known to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells, aiding in the development of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and production of lymphotoxin (LT), which promotes recruitment and activation of neutrophils and endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Conversely, cells of the TH2 subtype seem to function as physiologic regulators of immune responses, inhibiting potentially damaging TH1 responses. The major cytokines produced by activated TH2 cells are IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 mediate allergic reactions and the defense against helminthic infections; IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 antagonize the actions of IFN-\u03b3, thereby suppressing macrophage activation. IL-4 stimulates differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to the TH2 subset,91 leading to an interesting conundrum; differentiated TH2 cells are the major source of IL-4, yet this cytokine is obligatory for TH2 differentiation. Current thinking suggests that antigen-stimulated T cells (including NK-T cells, \u03b4\u03b3-T cells) and mast cells secrete small quantities of IL-4; in the context of persistent antigen stimulation, IL-4 concentrations locally increase. If the inflammation does not trigger IL-12 production, the result is increasing differentiation of the TH2 subset of T cells.82 Thus, the so-called key determinant of the TH2 profile may be persistent or repeated T-cell stimulation with little inflammation or macrophage activation. Other possible explanations include the production of IL-4 by other cell types or genetic factors that influence an individual's sensitivity to IL-4. Excessive or uncontrolled TH2 proliferation is associated with deficient cell-mediated immunity, particularly to infections by intracellular microbes (e.g., mycobacteria).1\n",

            "text": "Support for this conceptual model of allergic inflammation can be found in several experimental observations. In an in vivo study, Linden et al58 challenged 10 allergic rhinitis subjects with birch pollen and 20 normal subjects with coronavirus. Ten of the 20 normal subjects inoculated developed upper respiratory infections (URIs). In contrast to patients with allergic rhinitis, subjects who developed URIs had increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 (P < 0.05) in nasal lavage fluids that correlated with symptoms (P < 0.001). These authors clearly showed that distinct cytokine profiles are expressed in viral URIs and allergic rhinitis, thereby supporting the concept that TH1 cytokines (especially IFN-\u03b3) are present in viral infection. Schwartz et al86 measured the T-cell cytokine response (IFN-\u03b3) in two adult patients who were mildly atopic but had extremely elevated IgE levels (4000\u20136000 IU/mL). Compared with cells obtained from a control subject, the peripheral blood monocytes obtained from these patients and cultured in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 were refractory to TH1 stimuli (IL-2, tetanus, phytohemaglutinin). The authors concluded that these elevated IgE levels represent an overly dominant T-cell commitment to the TH2 cytokine pattern, and speculated that such patients may have a defect in TH1/TH2 regulation. Tavernier et al93 attempted to discern whether the differences between atopic and nonatopic individuals were the result of proliferative responses of stimulated T cells or of the cytokine profile elicited by these cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 atopic and 10 nonatopic subjects were stimulated in vitro with house dust mite, cat, and dog allergens, and cell culture supernatants were assayed for IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-\u03b3. No differences in either T-cell proliferation or IFN-\u03b3 levels were detected in the atopic versus nonatopic subjects. Significantly higher IL-5 levels, however, were detected among mite-sensitive subjects after stimulation with mite extract and in cat-sensitive subjects stimulated with cat extract. Similarly, IL-4 levels were significantly higher among cat-sensitive subjects stimulated with cat extract and dog-sensitive atopic subjects stimulated with dog extract. Such results point to differences in elicited cytokine profiles by stimulated T cells, rather than to differences in their ability to proliferate in response to allergen stimulation.",

Interestingly, delivery of sIL-4R by way of the airways (nebulized) proved to be a more potent modulator of airways hyperresponsiveness and was also effective in inhibiting hypersensitivity responses\u2014leading the authors to speculate that the soluble receptor may be an effective therapy for allergic responses to aerosolized allergens. A study using intraperitoneal or intranasal sIL-4R in allergen-challenge in a mouse model of asthma recently has been completed. As anticipated, aerosol delivery of soluble receptor effectively blocked aspects of the late-phase pulmonary response (personal communication, W. Henderson, May 1999).

They found that the levels of TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) correlated with the observed increases in eosinophil numbers and IgE levels, but the levels of TH1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-8) did not. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 levels seemed to correlate with those of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Soluble IL-6 receptor correlated significantly with eosinophils and soluble IL-4 receptor with IgE levels (P < 0.0001). In most cases, positive correlations between cytokines and their soluble receptors could be demonstrated. Such results imply that the release of soluble cytokine receptors occurs in vivo and that their presence has a modulatory effect on the various cytokines.",

IL-13 and IL-4 can induce STAT6, and STAT6-deficient mice cannot make IgE,67 thereby supporting the postulate that STAT6 signaling (and therefore induction by IL-4 or IL-13) is critical to IgE switching, eosinophilia, and allergic inflammation.105 Interestingly, the differential requirement for IL-13 independent of IL-4 in experimental asthma offers an alternate pathway for induction of allergic inflammatory responses.38 This feature is particularly intriguing in the context of the observations of Doucet et al30: that IL-4 and IL-13 specifically increase adhesion molecule and cytokine expression by human lung fibroblasts. Consequent triggering and maintenance of inflammatory cell recruitment and homing may help explain airways remodeling.

Anti-IgE binds circulating IgE, preventing the interaction of IgE with its surface receptors on mast cells, thereby precluding subsequent signaling and release of mast cell inflammatory mediators. An antihuman IgE antibody has shown promise in lowering IgE levels and modulating the early- and late-phase allergic response in a phase II study in atopic adults with asthma.13 In a phase II trial in allergic rhinitis, Casale et al19 showed that the recombinant human monoclonal antibody to IgE (rhuMAb-E25) significantly decreased serum levels of free IgE in a dose-dependent manner. Because rhinitis symptom scores correlated with antigen-specific IgE levels, the authors concluded that the monoclonal antibody should prove an effective therapy for allergic diseases, but they were unable to demonstrate statistically or clinically significant improvements in symptoms within the dosage range tested. A phase III trial in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis recently has been completed; although the results have not yet been published in the peer-reviewed literature, a press release stated that the anti-IgE \u201cdecreased the severity of nasal and ocular allergy symptoms compared to placebo, and reduced the number of rescue allergy medication tablets by more than 50 percent.\u201d35\n",
