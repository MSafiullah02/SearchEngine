The astrovirus genome is approximately 7000 nt long and has a 5\u2032 untranslated region followed by three open reading frames (ORF\u2019s), a 3\u2032 untranslated region, and a poly-A tail. Two ORF\u2019s, ORF-1a and ORF-1b, are linked by a translational frame-shift and encode the non-structural proteins [5, 6]. Analysis of ORF-1b indicates that it encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [7]. This region of the astrovirus genome is the most conserved gene between the mammalian and the avian astroviruses, as well as among the avian astroviruses [8]. ORF-2 encodes the capsid protein, which is the primary antigenic determinant of the virus.",

[9] in the United Kingdom, and the first isolate of TAstV in the United States was identified in 1985 [10]. A second TAstV type, which was antigenically and genetically distinct from the previously identified United States isolates (TAstV-1), was isolated in 1996. This and similar isolates have been designated TAstV-2 [8, 11, 12]. The entire genome sequence of the prototype TAstV-2 isolate, NC/96, has been reported and bears many similar features to human astroviruses (HAstV\u2019s) [11]. Based on epidemiological studies using electron microscopy as many as 78% of turkey flocks presenting enteritis have TAstV in their feces [13]. For this reason TAstV-2 is believed to be one of the etiological agents of poult enteritis complex, an economically important polymicrobial disease characterized by enteritis and, in severe cases, high mortality in commercial turkeys under 6 weeks of age [14].",

Specimens were collected primarily from flocks affected with enteritis, however, two isolates (NC/SEP/A40/03 and NC/SEP/A252/04) came from flocks described as healthy and performing well. Total RNA was extracted from intestinal contents by diluting 200 \u00b5l of the sample in 1.2 ml of PBS, homogenizing and performing a clarification by centrifugation. Then 250 \u00b5l of the supernatant was used for RNA extraction with Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

            "text": "The irregular assortment of the polymerase and capsid genes of these and other individual viruses suggests that recombination may be occurring among TAstV isolates in the field. Genome recombination has been reported for several positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses including: astroviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and caliciviruses [17, 20\u201328]. To address the issue of recombination in more detail, ten isolates were sequenced in the intergenic region and analyzed. The 2.9 kb nucleotide sequence spanning the amplified region of the polymerase and capsid genes of four of these isolates (VA/SEP/A33/03, CA/SEP/A269/04, NC/SEP/A222/03 and TX/SEP/A311/04) and the TAstV-2 (NC/96) prototype was selected to demonstrate results. The SimPlot computer program [29] was used to analyze the alignment of the five TAstV isolates using a window size of 200 nucleotides that was moved along in 20-nucleotide steps. The percent identity was calculated for each window and plotted in a line chart. The chart showed that VA/SEP/A33/03 shared a low level of sequence identity in the polymerase region when compared to TAstV-2 NC/96 and a constantly high level of nt identity in the capsid region with the same virus. A single cross of the two curves was observed 200 nt after the ORF-1b/ORF-2 junction (Fig. 4). The likelihood analysis of recombination in DNA (LARD) program [30] was used to identify the point of recombination between VA/SEP/A33/03 and TAstV-2 NC/96. The predicted site was at nucleotide 1120 of the region amplified. This recombination site was different than the site suggested with other RNA viruses, where the recombination site is frequently found at the conserved region of the ORF\u2019s junction [19, 24, 27]. When isolate CA/SEP/A269/04 and TAstV-2 NC/96 were compared, no significant change of sequence identity was observed between the polymerase and capsid regions. When isolates NC/SEP/A222/03 and TX/SEP/A311/04 were compared with TAstV-2 a low level of sequence identity in the polymerase and capsid regions was observed, although the junction region and the region from nucleotides 200 and 900 of the capsid gene had higher sequence identity.\n",

[20] reported that phylogenetic analysis of different regions of human astroviruses provided contradictory genotyping and demonstrated the occurrence of recombination between strains. Recombination requires concomitant infection of one host with two strains. Natural co-infection with two strains is certainly feasible due to the high incidence of TAstV-2 in commercial turkeys. The preferred mechanism of recombination among ssRNA viruses is a copy-choice mechanism where the polymerase enzyme switches from copying one RNA molecule (donor template) to another (acceptor template) without releasing the nascent strand [31].",

Eight serotypes of HAstV and three serotypes of bovine astrovirus have been defined [1] and are believed to evolve to some extent as immunological escape mutants. Interestingly, turkeys do not seem to elicit a good antibody response to the TAstV [32], which may explain why the virus circulates as multiple discrete sub-lineages similar to HIV [33, 34] as opposed to homogenous populations which undergo gradual antigenic drift with host immune pressure thereby assorting chronologically and geographically [35, 36].",

Multiple TAstV genotypes were often present in one geographical region and even on the same farm. Although the polymerase gene assorted into two phylogenetic groups, this gene was more conserved and may be able to serve as a target for nucleic acid detection tests. Furthermore, evidence of recombination was shown by different topologies of the polymerase and capsid gene phylogenetic trees and by SimPlot analysis. It is also interesting to note that the two isolates collected from healthy flocks grouped together. Finally, extensive genetic variation, and the likely consequential antigenic variation, has practical implications for virus detection methods, vaccine development and epidemiological studies.",
