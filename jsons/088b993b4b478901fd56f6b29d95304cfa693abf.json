            "text": "The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the health organizations around the world [1] . Large institutions and even cancer centers have reoriented their clinical activity to accommodate the large number of patients with respiratory distress related to COVID-19 pneumonia. In many countries, official recommendations from authorities Page 3 of 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f have asked to cancel non-urgent clinical activities and elective surgery, and reduce out-patient clinic visits. Some centers have even turned their operating theater to intensive care units and mobilized young oncologist for working in the intensive care unit (ICU) [2] . In Europe and in North America, there are no clear data on how long this crisis will impact cancer patient care and many physicians are concerned by the \"distraction effect\" of the pandemic on the continuous care of cancer patients [3] . In this unique situation, cancer patient management is particularly complex and one must balance the risk of a delayed cancer diagnosis or potentially curative treatment against the obvious risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, management of resources allocated to cancer care such as general anesthesia availability, nurses and medical staff shortage either for medical leave or reallocation may be limited. This means that triage measures must be appropriately taken and, in this context, some of the international cancer societies have issued some recommendations that we want to summarize and adapt here for Liang et al. reported that 1% out of 1590 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 acute respiratory disease had a cancer medical record and a median age of 63 years. Moreover, patients with a cancer record had a more severe form of COVID-19 that those without cancer (7/18 [39%] vs. 124/1572 [8%], respectively; P = 0.0003). Patients with history of surgery or chemotherapy in the months before COVID-19 have greater risk of developing severe disease (odd ratio [OR]: 5.34; 95% CI: 1.80 -16.18; P = 0.0026) [4] .",

Interestingly only 42.7% were on active treatment (including chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy or radiation therapy). Regarding the outcome, 3/12 patients had serious illness, 1/12 required ICU level care, and 3/12 died [5] . Zhang et al identified that the recent use of anticancer therapies in the 14 days before COVID-19 such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery was an independent predictor of death or severe events with a hazard ratio greater than 4. The patients aged over 60 years had higher incidence of COVID-19 infection (4.3% vs. 1.8%, respectively) [6] . Furthermore, in cancer patients the risk of COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 when compared to the general population is increased by 3 times, the risk of severe is increased by 5 times, and the risk of death is increased by 8 times [6] . These findings have led the oncological groups to issue some cautiousness-raising recommendations. On the other side the risk taken by patients with postponed potentially curative options, or even palliative treatments has not been established yet for obvious reasons.",

However, Cortiula et al. insist on the risk of the so-called \"distraction effect\" on cancer patients outcome [3] . It is recommended to maintain a weekly MDTB meeting with one specialist per specialty with discussion limited to patients requiring critical decisions only; MDTB meeting should be held in rooms allowing for social distancing.

The critical point is that all types of patients should visit the clinic only when it is indispensable, meaning that we should screen all the follow-up patients in order to verify the necessity of their visit based on the national or regional guidelines in force. Telemedicine consultation in this setting has gained a lot of popularity ; and it can be used in many different ways [7] . The patients with organized appointments for a consultation or an IO procedure should be informed that in case of infection symptoms instead of coming at the in-or out-patient clinic they rather get at the relevant department for testing the day before. At present, a major problem is that testing patients is time-consuming. Even rapid tests performed directly on site, that need less than two and a half hour to obtain the results (measured from the time the sample is taken to the time the result arrives), pose a genuine organizational problem as we are facing a disease with high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, meaning that numerous patients require testing, and lack of isolated space for those waiting for their results.",

The infiltration of paravertebral nerves of T7 T8 and T9 allows the blockade of the sympathetic liver innervation but not the parasympathetic from the vagus nerve [13] . A double blind study comparing sedation and local anesthesia associated of not to sham injection or paravertebral block nerve using 12.5ml of bupivacaine 0.5% at each level, found a significant reduction of the pain assessed by pain analog scale (VAS) analysis during and after the procedure [13] .

Isolation of the diaphragm during thermal ablation of sub diaphragmatic liver tumors is also potentially useful since it reduced significantly the 24 hours cumulative dose of morphine by a factor of 20 [15] .

Poly-chemotherapy, extensive surgery, and some targeted therapies are responsible for major decrease in immunity. On the other hand, local therapies, such as thermal ablation, induces induce low decrease in immunity if any, with then probably no risk of increasing the viral infection risk and severity, as far as patient coming to the hospital are correctly protected and stay as short as possible. Moreover IO treatments have a low risk of post-treatment adverse events that might require long stay in hospital or access to post-operative intensive care. Thus French national recommendations, for treatment of digestive cancer during COVID-19 pandemic state that \"when possible, for lesion smaller than 3cm and liver metastases, percutaneous thermal ablation that uses less or no intensive care or post-operative care resources and allows for very short hospital stay should be favored\" [22] . For oligometastatic patients with a small tumor burden and a possible curative intent, the treatment must not be delayed, and they must be treated with short hospital stay, ideally as an out-patient procedure. Extensive liver resection will probably be delayed due to the possible lack of post-operative intensive care resources, but in some patient who require very extensive liver resection \"liver preparation\" before surgery with IO (i.e., preoperative portal vein embolization, portal vein deprivation, and pre-operative biliary drainage) can be performed. In such patient performing these radiologic procedures as early as possible will not place the patient at high risk, and will avoid him to queue up on the waiting list of patients scheduled for the end of outbreak restrictions and make him ready for surgery as soon as it will be possible in regards to other limitations.",

It has been shown in a randomized placebo-controlled trial that dexamethasone effectively reduce the occurrence of the post-embolization syndrome [30] . Short dexamethasone therapy (3 days) should be administered in TACE patients except those with contraindication (mainly uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) in order to lower post-TACE symptoms allowing a reduction of hospital duration. Except COVID-19 patients in the late phase (for whom TACE should be postponed), no warning against short-exposure of corticosteroids has been raised in the current context so far [31] .",

Once again pain treatment is beneficial to oncologic patients due to the possibility to treat patient in a single day hospital with very minor risks of prolonged hospitalization or need for intensive post-treatment care. The shortage in anesthetic resources including drugs such as curare and hypnotics lowers our access to general anesthesia and rachi-anesthesia is a very efficient surrogate to general anesthesia in the population of patients with painful pelvic bone metastases who can benefit from percutaneous osteosynthesis [50] .

Deep abdominal biopsy carries a low risk of complication and must be performed when needed to decide for treatment strategy. At last, when compared to other deep organ biopsy, lung biopsy carries the specific risk of pneumothorax and the decision to expose the patient to a prolonged hospital stay must be weighted in front of the benefit of early diagnosis. Both clinical and technical considerations must be balanced and discussed with the patient and multidisciplinary tumor board [55] . The benefit of an early diagnosis with possible access to a curative treatment must push toward no delay in biopsy. On the other hand, severe emphysema, a small, deep lesion, pre-existing comorbidities, a long trans pulmonary path and all factors known to increase risks and severity of pneumothorax must be discussed. Technically, an access with no transpulmonary path must be preferred if possible. Any countermeasure to pneumothorax such as opposite position immediately after biopsy, or even better side decubitus at the time of the biopsy with biopsied lung down are recommended [56, 57] . In addition, the use of blood patch [58, 59] or gelatin sponge slurry [60] or even normal saline tract sealant [58] are effective countermeasure to pneumothorax and chest tube placement. Overall, after 3 weeks of COVID-19 pandemic, our lung biopsy program has been maintained to 70 % of our usual practice avoiding biopsy in patients with emphysema as well as for nodule < 1 cm. Specific consideration must be taken for patient requiring biopsy to enter clinical trial or precision medicine studies. Decisions must be discussed with the patient and during MDTB meetings taking into account the actual benefit.",

Although this method has been less reported than thermal hot ablation techniques, this method has the advantage of being painless during treatment. However, it carries the risk of bleeding and tumor seeding along the needle tract since it cannot be ablated during withdrawal of treatment applicators[20]. Of course, substitution of curative ablation techniques by less invasive out-patient procedure like radioembolization (SIRT) can also be discussed. There are no randomized data comparing thermal ablation and SIRT, however radiation segmentectomy can provide local tumor control and 55% 5-years survival in cirrhotic patients with localized hepatocellular carcinoma[21]. This alternative is very well tolerated and limits the risk of short-term complications and secondary visits in the COVID-19 context.",
