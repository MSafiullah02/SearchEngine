            "text": "\nViral diseases are widespread throughout the world and can range from minor infections to plagues that alter the course of history. The burden of diseases induced by viral infections is enormous, with most of the deadly infectious diseases being caused by viral infections. Among the viruses, coronaviruses (CoVs; subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) represent a major group of viruses known to be responsible for respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in multiple species (Pene et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2009, Chan et al., 2012). The CoVs affecting human population are referred to as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). They lead to multiple respiratory diseases, such as common cold, pneumonia, and bronchitis (Lim et al., 2016). This century has seen rapid evolution of HCoVs, the contributory factors being urbanization and poultry farming. These factors allowed crossing of species barrier and genomic recombination of these viruses (Jones et al., 2013). Six HCoVs have been identified so far, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The latter four viruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) are mainly responsible for one-third of common cold infections in human, which in severe cases can lead to life-threatening pneumonia and bronchitis (van der Hoek, 2007). The former two viruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) are responsible for life-threatening conditions, i.e., SARS and MERS (Graham et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2016, Hemida et al., 2017). Both SARS and MERS epidemics have surfaced for first time in the present century. The symptoms of both these conditions are similar, i.e., pneumonia marked by fever, headache, and subsequent onset of respiratory symptoms, such as cough, which may later develop into life-threatening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (de Wit et al., 2016). However, MERS has a much higher mortality (~35%) as compared to SARS (~10%) (Rabaan, 2017).",

Thus, unlike bacterial and fungal infectious diseases there is no single, magic-bullet approach to control viral infections. The most remarkable progress so far has involved vaccines and interferon therapy (Durai et al., 2015, Tang and Marasco, 2015, Enjuanes et al., 2016).",

            "text": "However, viral polymerases have also emerged as potential targets for design of drugs for viral diseases. Activity of viral polymerases is needed in several steps of the virus life cycle (Shi et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2013, Deval et al., 2014, Velkov et al., 2014). Viral polymerases are known to play vital role in viral genome replication and transcription. They are thus critical for the survival and multiplication of viral particles. Two-thirds portion of the CoV genome from the 5\u02b9-end, expresses large replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab) which are cleaved by viral proteases to produce the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and helicase (Hel). RdRP is thus the core enzyme of multiprotein replicase\u2013transcriptase complex (RTC) required for transcription as well as replication of CoVs. One of the approaches for discovering anti-CoV drugs is to target the viral proteases thus inhibiting the production of RdRp and Hel, thereby blocking replication and transcription of CoV genome (Choi, 2012, Moradpour and Penin, 2013, Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016). In this chapter, the structure and functions of CoV RdRP will be discussed in detail along with a survey of design and development of RDRP inhibitors so far.",

Usually, the RdRP domain is readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, however biochemical characterization has been hindered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is now a well-known fact that replication and transcription of the ~30 kb CoV RNA genome is catalyzed by an RdRP domain in the C-terminal part of nsp12, one of 16 replicase subunits (Imbert et al., 2006, Sexton et al., 2016). However, thus far full-length, nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which hinder both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRP-targeted antiviral drug design. Interestingly, for SARS-CoV a second protein, 22-kDa nsp8, with RdRP activity has been identified. This enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure (i.e., nsp(7+8), consisting of eight copies of both nsps) (te Velthuis et al., 2012).",

            "text": "More than two decades ago, the sequence analysis of the first CoV genomes was performed, and more recently comparative sequence analysis has allowed identification of the putative RdRP domain of the CoV RTC (Boursnell et al., 1987, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, te Velthuis et al., 2010). The C-terminal, i.e., the two-thirds of the 930-odd-amino-acid subunit, known as nsp12 was successfully aligned with the conserved motifs of already known RdRPs (Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Xu et al., 2003). The unprecedented size of nsp12 among viral RdRP subunits, commonly ~500\u2013600 amino acids, suggests that it may possess other functional domains in its as yet uncharacterized N-terminal domain (NTD). Biochemical information on the CoV RdRP has, however, remained scarce so far, particularly because full-length nsp12 was refractory to expression in bacterial systems. Preliminary evidence for the in vitro RdRP activity of nsp12 came from a study of the SARS-CoV enzyme by Cheng et al. (2005). The experiments involved the use of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013nsp12 fusion protein. However, because of protein instability, the protein fragmented into three parts, hampering the studies. The studies also led to identification of primer-dependent activity on poly(A) template using filter-binding assays, however enzyme biochemistry was not further analyzed in detail (Cheng et al., 2005). Given its pivotal role in viral replication and the efficacy of polymerase inhibitors used to combat other virus infections, the RdRP is widely regarded as an important and attractive target for the rational design of anti-CoV drugs (Xu et al., 2003, De Clercq, 2004). Therefore, several research groups have tried to solve the technical issues involved in the stable expression, purification and in vitro activity of the full-length CoV nsp12. Reasonable success has been achieved in development of methods to generate recombinant nsp12 protein containing its natural N-terminus. This was found to be a critical step on the road toward the purification of a stable recombinant CoV RdRP (te Velthuis et al., 2010).",

The N-terminal loop of motif B contains three conserved residues (Ser682, Gly683, and Thr687) that seem to interact with the nucleotide that forms base-pairing with the incoming rNTP (21, 25\u201327 (Ago et al., 1999, Butcher et al., 2001, Ng et al., 2002, Tao et al., 2002). The \u03b1-helical part of motif B, along with the \u03b1-helix formed by motif D, is stacked beneath the central \u03b2-sheet. The conserved asparagine on motif B \u03b1-helix is considered to contribute to the specificity of RdRP for rNTPs versus deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). This is proposed to be due to hydrogen-bonding with the second conserved aspartate of motif A which in turn hydrogen-bonds to the 2\u02b9-OH of rNTP SARS-CoV RdRP. As seen in Table 10.1, Asn691 of motif B appears to interact with Asp623 of motif A through a hydrogen bond. Thus, Asn691 is likely to play similar role as Asn623, i.e., help sugar selection of rNTP.",

Most of the viruses spend their entire life cycle in host cell cytoplasm and thus do not have access to host polymerases and thus must encode their own polymerases for transcription and replication. Based on the type of genome, replication strategy, and need for transcription, viruses are classified into seven classes, while based on their function viral polymerases are classified into four classes, i.e., DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DdDP), DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP), RdRP, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDP) (reverse transcriptase). RdRP and reverse transcriptase are unique to virus, as host cell need not replicate RNA or perform reverse transcription, while other polymerases are present in host cell, too.",

The RdRPs perform the same basic function as all the other viral polymerases, i.e., to copy a nucleic acid template strand to yield a daughter strand. This activity involves transfer of a nucleotidyl moiety of incoming NTP (complementary to template strand) to the 3\u02b9-end of a growing daughter strand of DNA or RNA. The polymerase activity requires two divalent metal cations, i.e., Mg2+/Mn2+. The polymerase active site consists of binding sites for the template strand, primer (i) and the incoming NTP (i+1). The reaction steps include binding of template\u2013primer and NTP, incorporation of nucleoside monophosphate into the growing daughter strand with the release of pyrophosphate, and translocation of the template strand and growing daughter strand from i+1 site to i site. The metal ions bound to the aspartate residues play their roles by (1) facilitating the reaction between 3\u02b9-OH of terminal RNA or DNA primer and the alpha phosphate group of incoming nucleotide through binding to 3\u02b9-OH and increasing its nucleophilicity and (2) positioning the incoming NTP by binding to its phosphates and stabilizing the pyrophosphate leaving group.",

            "text": "Among the RdRPs of CoVs, one of the most well studied in terms of mechanism of action is that of SARS-CoV. There are two replicase subunits with RdRP activities that are believed to be involved in replication of SARS-CoV genome. The first one is 106-kDa nsp12 while the second one involves the 22-kDa nsp8. As discussed previously, RNA genome replication is a crucial step in SARS-CoV propagation and is mediated by the RNA replicase, which is composed of viral nsps and host proteins. SARS-CoV nsp12 is the first protein encoded by ORF1b and generated by cleavage of pp1ab by PLpro and 3CLpro. It is considered the catalytic core of the RNA replicase due to the presence of the SDD motif that is common to coronavirus RdRPs (Oh and Ahn, 2013). During the synthesis of viral genome and subgenomes, nsp12 initiates the RNA synthesis from the 3\u02b9 ends of the viral genome and subgenomes in plus and minus senses (Selisko et al., 2006). The correct initiation of the synthesis of RNA is crucial for maintenance of the viral genome\u2019s integrity. Generally, RNA viruses utilize two mechanisms to initiate the RNA synthesis: de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation (Kao et al., 2001). In de novo initiation the starting nucleotide provides the 3\u02b9 hydroxyl group for the addition of the next nucleotide, whereas in primer-dependent initiation a separate oligonucleotide or protein primer is required to provide the hydroxyl nucleophile (Masters, 2006).",

They developed a reliable protocol for successful expression, purification, and in vitro activity of stable SARA-CoV nsp12 (te Velthuis et al., 2010). The first part of their study involved description of a combined strategy that involved bacterial expression of nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Ubp1), which recognizes the cleavage site in nsp12 that is locates between ubiquitin (Ub) moiety and N-terminus. Proteolytic cleavage of nsp12 fusion protein generates purified and stable SARS-CoV nsp12, containing its natural N-terminus. In the second part of the study, Aartjan et al. assessed the polymerase activity of the nsp12 by monitoring the incorporation of nucleotides on a synthetic RNA template. The extension of the primer was observed by incorporation of [\u03b1-32P] ATP and the extension of the 32P-labeled primer. The sequence alignments of SARS-CoV nsp12 with a known structure of an RdRP revealed that the nsp12 residues 618, 760 and 761 are the canonical aspartic acids responsible for the coordination of the divalent cation in the active site of RdRP. In other viral RdRPs, the substitution of equivalent residues with asparagine or alanine resulted in changing or abolishing the activity of polymerase. In order to obtain an active site mutant that could be used as negative control, Aartjan et al. engineered an nsp12 mutant D618A. The mutant protein showed only 8 \u00b1 3% residual primer extension activity. Therefore, it confirms the nsp12-specific nature of the RdRP activity and supports the previous hypothesis that this residue is an essential player in the active site of the enzyme (te Velthuis et al., 2010).",

They tried to find whether the dsRNA-binding channel of this complex plays any role in the RdRP activity of nsp8 and whether this activity is influenced by nsp7 (Imbert et al., 2006). Therefore, they generated and purified recombinant forms of SARS-CoV nsp8 and nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex that have natural N-terminal residues. Their finding proved that exposure of the natural N-terminus is crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex on partially dsRNA templates, demonstrating that nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex is multimeric RNA polymerase that is capable of primer extension as well. The activity is 20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp at equal monomer concentration. Moreover, they performed a site-directed mutagenesis of nsp8 to identify residues that may contribute to the catalytic center of the nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex polymerase. Their efforts resulted in two observations: (1) mutation of the conserved N-terminal D/ExD/E motif, including SARS-CoV residues D50 and D52, abolished the polymerase activity, while mutation of the C-terminal motif, comprising of D161 and D163 in SARS-CoV, did not affect RdRP activity; (2) the primer extension activity of nsp8 is severely affected by the presence of N-terminal extensions, i.e., ubiquitin and His6, due to changing its oligomeric state. The strong activity of nsp7\u2013nsp8 complex indicates that the activity of nsp8 is unlikely to be directly controlled by an N-terminal cleavage event, as was observed for the PV polymerase (Marcotte et al., 2007). These observations propose that a more diverse array of nsp8-containing RdRPs may be involved in CoV transcription and replication (te Velthuis et al., 2012).",

            "text": "HCoV-2295 and HCoV-OC43 were the only HCoVs known before the SARS epidemic. These two viruses cause self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. In 2003 when SARS-CoV suddenly emerged, the researchers especially those involved in antiviral research were not so well prepared. The improvement in SARS treatment depends on identifying effective antivirals for viral load suppression. Thus, three general approaches were used to identify potential antiviral treatment for HCoV infections (Barnard and Kumaki, 2011, Kilianski and Baker, 2014). The first and fastest approach to drug discovery was to test drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity that were used to treat CoV associated human infections. Numerous agents were identified by this approach including interferon alpha, beta, and gamma, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors (de Wilde et al., 2013, Falzarano et al., 2013, Frausto et al., 2013, Chan et al., 2015, Zumla et al., 2016). The second drug discovery approach to identify antivirals for SARS involved screening of chemical libraries that comprised numerous existing compounds or databases, containing information on transcriptional signatures in different cell lines. Various classes of drugs were identified by this approach including those that affect neurotransmitter regulation, kinase signaling, protein processing, estrogen receptor, lipid metabolism, and DNA synthesis or repair (Chan et al., 2013, de Wilde et al., 2014, Elshabrawy et al., 2014). The third approach to identify treatment for SARS included de novo development of specific antiviral agents based on viral genome and structural biology of individual CoVs. The development of such candidate drugs was more time-consuming than that in the first two approaches. Many viral inhibitors were identified by this method including mAbs that target the host receptor, siRNA inhibitors that target specific viral enzymes involved in the viral replication cycle, inhibitors of virus endocytosis by the host cell, and inhibitors of host cellular proteases (Du et al., 2014, Jiang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2014, Ying et al., 2014, Chan et al., 2015).",

Although its mechanism of action is still a debatable issue, it blocks the replication of various RNA and DNA viruses by inhibiting inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase which is a key enzyme involved in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) biosynthesis. Ribavirin also inhibits the viral RdRP activity by blocking mRNA capping and induction of mutations in RNA-dependent viral replication. However, ribavirin did not show any significant activity against SARS-CoV replication in cell culture\u2014its required inhibitory concentration is much higher (500\u20135000 \u03bcg/mL) than that needed to inhibit other viruses (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL). Thus, it does not appear to represent a viable treatment option. However, high doses of ribavirin have been used in treating SARS patients, but its clinical application has been limited due to severe side effects associated with the high doses (Booth et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003, De Clercq, 2006, Cheng et al., 2013, Peters et al., 2015).\n",

Yap et al. have experimentally shown that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (2) could selectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication inside host cells, leading to viral mRNA transcripts production 1000-fold less than that in untreated control (Yap et al., 2005). This is possibly related to the inhibition of SARS-CoV RdRP (Anand et al., 2003, Bermejo Martin et al., 2003, Koren et al., 2003, He et al., 2004, Yap et al., 2005). In this study, Yap et al. incorporated multiple bioinformatics tools to investigate the potential binding modes/sites of ATA with RdRP of SARS-CoV and other pathogenic positive-strand RNA viruses as well as with several other proteins. The positive controls used in this study constituted of three proteins for which crystal structures are available: Ca2+-activated neutral protease (m-calpain), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) of Yersinia pestis, and HIV integrase. Eight regions with homologous 3D-conformation were obtained for 10 proteins of interest. R\nbinding (754\u2013766) is one of these regions located in the palm subdomain of SARS-CoV RdRP, which was predicted by molecular docking studies to be important binding motif recognized by ATA (Cushman and Sherman, 1992, Posner et al., 1995, Liang et al., 2003, Sun et al., 2003, Yap et al., 2005). The results of this experiment showed that ATA could bind to RdRP as well as other proteins in SARS-CoV where it can inhibit their activity by incorporating its binding motifs to the catalytic domains of the specific proteins. This inhibitory binding mechanism, especially for RdRPs, could explain why mRNA transcripts were reduced by 1000-folds when SARS-infected cell culture was treated with ATA compared to untreated control. Thus, ATA could be developed as potent antiviral drug targeting the replication machinery in possibly over a large group of positive-strand RNA viruses (Yap et al., 2005).\n",

These analogs are based on flexible acyclic sugar scaffold of acyclovir (ACV) and flex-base motif found in fleximers that inhibit RdRP. These doubly flexible nucleoside analogs were evaluated for their antiviral activity and viewed as a novel class of drug candidates with potential of inhibiting several CoVs. Fleximers are unique nucleoside analogs that possess purine base scaffold where pyrimidine and imidazole rings are attached by a single carbon\u2013carbon bond instead of being fused like in typical purines. The designed analogs retain all the essential purine hydrogen-bonding pattern, as well as they allow the nucleobase to explore alternative binding modes. These analogs have several advantages including binding affinity to atypical enzymes, ability to overcome resistance caused by point mutations in biologically important binding sites, and increased binding affinity compared to other inhibitors. Peters et al. described the design, synthesis, and preliminary screening of this new class of nucleoside analogs. Flex-base modifications of fleximers were combined with acyclic sugar scaffold of ACV, a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (Fig. 10.5\n) (Peters et al., 2015).",

Further, its thumb subdomain is smaller than that of HCV RdRP and the essential part of inhibitor binding pocket of HCV does not exist in it. Therefore, it seems that the nonnucleoside inhibitors for HIV-1 or HCV may not work for SARS-CoV polymerase. However, different allosteric site exists in SARS-CoV polymerase which can be targeted for the development of SARS-CoV polymerase inhibitors (Xu et al., 2003).",

Two nsps with RdRP activity have been identified for SARS CoV, which are nsp12 and nsp8 having de novo and primer-dependent polymerase activity, respectively. Studies have led to reveal many of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the polymerase domain facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Numerous approaches to develop RdRP inhibitors ranging from small molecule inhibitors to fleximers of ACV and siRNAs have been explored in the recent past. Fundamental research into CoV RdRP is thus proving to be invaluable, and will likely continue to be, in combating current and emerging CoV infections.",
