Pakistani strain MT240479 (Gilgit1-Pak) was found in close proximity to MT184913 (CruiseA-USA), while the second Pakistani strain MT262993 (Manga-Pak) was neighboring to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain in the constructed cladogram in this article. Afterward, four whole genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences were taken for variant calling analysis, those who appeared nearest relative in the earlier cladogram constructed a week time ago. Among those two Pakistani strains each of 29,836 bases were compared against MT263429 from (WI-USA) of 29,889 bases and MT259229 (Wuhan-China) of 29,864 bases. We identified 31 variants in both Pakistani strains, (Manga-Pak vs USA=2del+7SNPs, Manga-Pak vs Chinese=2del+2SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs USA=10SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese=8SNPs), which caused alteration in ORF1ab, ORF1a and N genes with having functions of viral replication and translation, host innate immunity and viral capsid formation respectively. These novel variants are assumed to be liable for low mortality rate in Pakistan with 385 as compared to USA with 63,871 and China with 4,633 deaths by May 01, 2020. However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies.",

In the current century, the first wave of transmission started from SARS CoV in Guangdong, China and thereafter disseminated worldwide which resulted in 916 fatalities [2] . Next reported infected with SARS-nCoV2 strain in Wuhan-Hubei, China [4] . This infection got widespread and of May 01, 2020, 2,036,770 active cases, 234,279 (7.06%) deceased and 1,048,807 (31.59%) recovered has been reported worldwide [5] . This strain mainly belongs to the B-beta coronaviruses genus [6, 7] . It has been observed that mortality rate vary from country to country which pondered the scientists to look into linkage between different variants of the SARS-nCoV2 with its severity along with other influencing factors e.g. temperature, testing facility, lockdown measures, aging factor and hygienic practices. Recently published genomic characterization study speculated the proximal origin of human Corona virus from Bat (Rhinolophus affinis) and Pangolin (Maris javinica) strains by natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer or natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer due to the novel observed variants in Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and polybasic cleavage site of the Spike region [8] .",

SARS-nCoV2 might also have affected its interaction with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in humans causing low virulence but for validation of this assumption functional studies are needed. We also performed structural analysis and modelled mutant proteins 3D structure from target-template alignment using N and ORF1a proteins of USA and Chinese strains as template and both Pakistani N and ORF1a as target sequences to visualize it on amino acid level to further ensure the differences in studied strains.",

This hypothesis still needs more research to validate and to find out association of these mutant genes and other influencing factors with the pathogenicity of this virus.",

In the current era Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques are booming to let genomic data available seamlessly to scientists and researchers for deciphering an unseen in depth view of viruses on genomic level to overcome and combat this disease. For genomic level characterization and comparison, we did phylogenetic study on 784 Corona virus strains based on whole genome nucleotide sequenced available data, the two Pakistani strain MT240479 occurred in the same clade with MT184913 (CruiseA-USA) and MT262993 appeared in close proximity to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain. We also performed variant calling and detected 31 variants in N, ORF1ab and ORF1a genes while comparing Pakistani strains with MT263429 and MT259229. These mutational events come up with some predictive evidence about the outcomes of cases. On January 19, 2020 first case of COVID-19 was reported in Washington, USA and after one and half month time death rate was 27% while in Pakistan first case appeared on February 26, 2020 and death rate after the same time was 10.14% with 89.86% recovery rate, the death rate still going low up to today's statistics. Similarly, China too suffered from very high ratio of deceased people 43.18% same time after its first case was being reported [25] Gilgit1 and Manga strain variants are assumed to be linked with low severity of this pandemic along with other factors of high temperature, less elderly people and ablution practices in Pakistan.
