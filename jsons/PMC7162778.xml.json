Named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World health organization [1], the disease pandemic has resulted in a major health crisis. The pathogen of COVID-19 has been attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta coronavirus closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2]. COVID-19 has resulted in many infections and death throughout the world [3]. Unlike those seen in influenza, the morbidity and transmission modality of COVID-19 appear more severe and uncontrollable [4]. The primary pulmonary injury and subsequent cardiovascular complications constitute the key pathophysiology of this deadly disease. This review updates and summarizes the pathophysiological features, possible underlying mechanisms, and clinical characteristics of pulmonary and cardiovascular injury of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The highly contagious virus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the primary pathogen responsible for the development of COVID-19. It belongs to the Coronaviridae family [5]. Structurally and functionally similar to most members of the Betacoranavirus Subgroup B, SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1\n) has thought to be descended from a bat gene pool as the seventh member of coronavirus family known to infect humans, and comprises a positive-sense single-stranded RNA with 50\u2013200nm in size [6]. Among the other 6 coronaviruses capable of causing illnesses, only SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reportedly cause severe disease and fatalities [7]. Infection by the other 4 coronaviruses remains asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in normal people. According to the full-length genome sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 is 79.5% homologous with SARS-CoV. Like SARS-CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infects lung alveolar epithelial cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis in association with angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) [8]. An epidemiological study enrolling 44672 confirmed cases in China has indicated that the overall case-fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was about 2.3% [9], whereas it was 9.6% (774/8096) in the SARS-CoV epidemic [10] and 34.4% (858/2494) in the MERS-CoV outbreak [11]. Mortality in Italy, Spain and France may be higher and closer to that of SARS-CoV. This may be due to strain variation, yet to be determined. However, in consideration of rapidly increasing numbers of confirmed cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission [12,13], the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity seems to be stronger than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Ultrastructural examination of SARS-CoV-2 by cryo-electron microscopy has demonstrated that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 appears approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than SARS-CoV, structurally explaining why SARS-CoV-2 has a high contagiousness [14].",

Shen, et al. [15] has recently reported a genomic diversity of SARS-Cov-2 in patients with COVID-19. They observed, by meta-transcriptomal sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from of COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, and healthy individuals. They observed a limited polymorphism and diversity in the intra-host setting, and a substantial proportion of bacteria in several COVID-19 patients, similar to other patients with non-coronaviral pneumonia. As a common complication of viral infection, especially for respiratory viruses, secondary bacterial infection often results in a significant increase in morbidity or even mortality. Indeed, in the retrospective observational study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, Du, et al. [16] reported that in addition to SARS-Cov-2 infection, simultaneously or secondarily, other pathogens may participate in the COVID-19 development and complications, contributing to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Thus, co-infection of other pathogens certainly complicates the pathogenesis and management of COVID-19.",

People with confirmed COVID-19 usually develop fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing).

Initially, testing for all other sources of respiratory infection is implemented while assessing epidemiologic factors to assist their diagnosis, including the information as to whether the person has had close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within 14 days of symptom onset or a history of travel from affected geographic areas or epicenters within 14 days.",

The samples need to be processed quickly and stored at four degrees celsius. The reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are a standard procedure for viral genomic sequence identification, which involves the synthesis of a double-stranded DNA molecule from the RNA template. If patients are confirmed COVID-19 positively, their laboratory evaluation should be repeated to evaluate for viral clearance prior to being released from quarantine. Patients with the early stage of COVID-19 may have a normal or decreased total white blood cell count and a decreased lymphocyte count. Subsequently, neutrophils arise wit lymphopenia, and the increased ratio of neutriophils vs. lymphocytes is considered a negative prognostic factor. Patients may have increased values of LDH, muscle enzymes, and C-reactive protein. In critical patients, the thrombogenic biomarker D-dimer may increase, the counts of blood lymphocytes decline persistently, and laboratory alterations in biomarkers of multi-organ injury become prominent.",

Wang et al. [18] suggest that diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or titer rising \u22654 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.",

The death rate remains high in those admitted to the intensive care and on ventilator due to complications of respiratory and cardiac failure [16]. Even though the lung is the primary organ damaged by the virus, COVID-19 is now regarded as a systemic disease, involving a broad range of other vital organs, such as heart, liver and kidney [20]. However, it remains largely unclear whether the organ and tissue injury in patients with COVID-19 is the direct or indirect consequence of the virus infection. ACE2, a known protein binding to SARS-CoV-2, is expressed widely in various organs and tissues, including the cardiovascular, digestive and urogenital systems beside the respiratory tract [21,22]. Theoretically the virus may target those organs and tissues with positive expression of ACE2. Cardiovascular cells are known to express ACE2 at high levels, which serves as a key regulator of blood pressure and cardiac contractility [23]. Moreover, the virus infection may trigger a drastic immune response which leads to production of large quantities of cytokines, i.e. \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, which may indiscriminately injure vital organs [24]. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 infection injures the myocardium, leading to elevated levels of myocardial biomarkers (eg, troponin I > 28 pg/mL) and certain abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography [25]. Increasing clinical evidence indicates that virus infection-associated cardiac dysfunction worsen COVID-19 patient's clinical conditions usually in association with the poor prognosis [26,27]. In spite of the observation that myocardial injury occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients [28], the underlying mechanisms remains largely unclear. Several lines of clinical evidence point to the possibility of viral infection directly occurring in the myocardium. Both direct and indirect pathogenic impacts of the virus infection may cause injury of the pulmonary and myocardial tissues (Fig. 2\n).",

            "text": "Recent autopsy reports have demonstrated several anatomical features of COVID-19-induced pulmonary and myocardial injury. The early lung of COVID-19 patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells [31]. Liu et al. showed that the lung and cardiac tissues contain significant amounts of inflammatory infiltrates, indicating the inflammatory nature of tissue damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection [26]. Patients with a medical history of coronary heart disease are prone to the cardiac injury caused by COVID-19. Although there was no evidence that the acute episode of cardiac injury was caused by coronary events in this patient, one may not rule out the possibility that the underlying medical condition might have made the patient more vulnerable to the hypoxia- and cytokine storm-induced cardiac ischemia [32]. Moreover, post-mortem examinations showed moderate pericardial effusion with light yellow and clear liquid and mild epicardial edema indicative of myocardial inflammation, further suggesting that a peri-cardiac inflammatory response contributes to the myocardial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. In a pilot study, Xu et al. [33] failed to find evidence of myocardial injury in a histopathologic case by autopsy, in which there were only a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without other substantial damage in the cardiac tissue. This paradoxical result may be attributed to the small sample size and absent clinical evidence of myocardial injury in this case. Overall, future research is needed to enroll more cases with definite clinical evidence of myocardial injury to further investigate histopathologic characteristics of COVID-19-related myocardial injury. The viral infection induces an excessive immune reaction in the host, which in turn generates a 'cytokine storm', comprising released by proinflammatory cytokines known to act on cardiovascular cells [34,35]. One of the protagonists in the cytokine storm is interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is produced and released by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues. IL-6 promotes the differentiation and activation of B lymphocytes, and stimulates the production of acute phase proteins.",

In an observational study of 52 critical sick adult COVID-19 patients, 19 patients suffered from acute myocardial injury, and 9 of them (75%) died [29], suggesting a higher mortality in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular complications. Analysis of COVID-19 related death cases has confirmed that myocardial injury was one of the major causes of death. In a review of 25 death cases with COVID-19, Xun et al. found that the serum cTnI were significantly increased in 18 cases, and more COVID-19 cases with heart injury than other organ injuries except for the lung. Zhang et al. reported that 89% of 82 death cases were observed with myocardial injury, which was second only to death cases with pulmonary injury [36]. Moreover, in a study of 416 COVID-19 patients, myocardial injury was independently associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality [27].

Structurally, the SARS-CoV-2 particle has an ACE2-binding domain [40]. The virus binds to human ACE2 with high affinity, and uses it as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in two distinct conformations, along with inhibition of spike-mediated entry by SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and therapeutics. Although the main target is the epithelium of respiratory system, the virus may use the ACE2 path to invade cardiomyocytes directly as many cardiovascular cells express ACE2 (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 may trigger ACE2 activation and upregulate ACE2 downstream signal transduction, including the activation of Ras-ERK\u2013AP-1 pathway [41].

            "text": "As the cellular receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is a monocarboxylase highly expressed in cardiac tissue [42], and exhibits cardio-protective roles as a potent negative regulator of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) by counterbalancing functions of ACE [43]. As a membrane protein, it can also initiate outside-in signaling [44]. SARS-CoV have been previously demonstrated to induce myocarditis in a ACE2-dependent manner [45]. The trimers of the SARS-CoV spike protein initially extends into a hydrophobic pocket of ACE2 catalytic domain [46], which consequentially leads to the endocytosis of SARS-CoV particles and fusion of virus to cardiomyocytes with the help of type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2) [47], finally downregulating ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes [48,49]. When RAS is over-activated further myocardial injury is a consequence in SARS patients. Moreover, downregulation of ACE2 may be, at least partly, caused by the shedding of ACE2 ectodomain, mediated by TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) in coupling with the production of TNF-\u03b1, a well-known pro-fibrotic and myocardial impairing factor [50]. The binding between SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 on the cardiomyocyte surface also triggers the Ras-ERK\u2013AP-1 pathway and activates the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, a pro-fibrosis factor) [41]. The above theories are supported by an autopsy report of heart samples from SARS patients, in which the presence of SARS-CoV in the heart was associated with marked down-regulation of ACE2 expression as well as a significant increase in macrophage infiltration and interstitial fibrosis, verifying ACE2 inhibition is involved in SARS-CoV-driven myocardial injury [49].",

This physiological mechanism may be involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial injury. As is well-known, pulmonary dysfunction is the primary insult of SARS-CoV-2, which induces hypoxemia, hypotension and, in some cases, shock [20,39]. As a consequencet, an insufficient oxygen supply may occur in multiple organs including the heart. Concomitantly, myocardial oxygen demand is increased in virus-infection states, as high metabolic rate induces an augmented burden on the myocardium [54], further causing the imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Along with disease progression, this imbalance is increasingly aggravated, which may result in myocardial injury in COVID-2019 patients, especially for those with cardiovascular disorders who have already exhausted myocardial reserve capacity on the supply side. Other systemic contributors may include, in addition to hypoxia, respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, fluid or electrolyte disorders and an activated neuro-humoral system following severe infection may also lead to myocardial stunning and injury, even inducing malignant arrhythmia and sudden death.",

            "text": "Previous studies have confirmed that the immune abnormality is related to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection [45]. Specifically, cytokine storm, an excessive and uncontrollable cytokines production in response to infection, is suggested to be the main contributor, as numerous studies have found that the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [eg, Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), IFN\u03b3 inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)] are significantly increased in COVID-19 patients, associated with disease progression [55,56]. Among so many cytokines, IL-6 serves as the core of cytokine storm, given that IL-6 not only amplifies cytokine storm by stimulating production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also results in vascular leakage, interstitial edema [57]. Moreover, IL-6 has also been shown to weaken papillary muscle contraction, which causes myocardial dysfunction [58]. In addition, IFN\u03b3 is also regarded as a marker of cytokine storm, causing cell apoptosis through regulating JAK/STAT1 axis and p38-MAPK1 [59]. However, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 are also increased in COVID-19 patients, and their levels are also related to disease severity [55,56], demonstrating the close relation between pro- and anti-inflammation. Cytokine storm is a clear contributor to COVID-19-related myocardial injury, demonstrated by a study that revealed that increased levels of IL-6 were significantly associated with high hs-TnI levels [26], a cardiac-selective biomarker of myocardial infarction and injury [37]. Further studies are needed to explore the cytokine expression in cardiomyocytes, which will promote a better understanding for SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in cardiac tissue.",

Additionally, confirmed cases of COVID-19 show several more-specific symptoms, such as anosmia, dysgeusia, chest pain [26,38] and palpitation [60]. Electro physiologically, COVID-19 patients are prone to the development of arrhythmia, especially tachycardia, indicative for myocardial injury. In a study of 138 COVID-19 patients, 23 patients (16.7%) presented with arrhythmia, and other evidence for myocardial injury [12]. Indeed, the COVID-19 patients with tachycardia were often in severe or critical situations. For a better understanding of the etiology of cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19, researchers analyzed body temperature in different groups (mild, light, severe and critical groups), given the fact that high fever caused by the virus infection and inflammation can elevate the heart rate. The result showed that there was no significant difference in the body temperature correlation with arrhythmia between the mild and severe/critical groups. Many COVID-19 patients with tachycardia are severely ill and need critical care, as tachycardia represents a sign of a failing heart [30].",

Hui et al. reported that the mean EAT density of critical/severe groups in chest CT scan were significantly lower than patients in the light/mild groups (-98.77 /-96.08 HU vs -69.37/-84.76 HU), suggesting that myocardial inflammation occurred in COVID-19 patients [30]. As the cytokine storm and consequent inflammatory response are suggested to be the mechanisms contributing to myocardial injury, low EAT density showed in chest CT scan appears to be a high-risk factor for myocardial injury. However, low EAT density is not the optimal imaging parameter of COVID-19-related myocardial injury since it is an indirect sign of inflammation and may be substantively influenced by subjective factors in clinical practice. Other imaging modalities with high sensitivity and specificity such as echocardiography and myocardial magnetic resonance imaging should be preferentially chosen if appropriate.",

            "text": "Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are traditional anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drugs. They have been shown to control the SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro [61,68]. The underlying mechanism may involve the increase in the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, interference with the glycosylation of ACE2 [69] and inactivation of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [70]. A small sample size study showed that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients [71], but this conclusion still has not been verified by ongoing RCTs [72,73]. The cardiotoxicity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine should not be neglected. They may prolong QT interval and induce ventricular arrhythmia [74]. Thus, they should be used very cautiously (if at all) to treat COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or uncorrected electrolyte disorder. Given the pivotal role of immunologic overresponse in COVID-19, anti-inflammatory therapy is also promising for treating COVID-19. Corticosteroids were used during the SARV-Cov and MERS-Cov outbreaks and have also been used for patients with COVID-19. However, previous studies on whether corticosteroids exert protective [75,76] or adverse [77] effect in SARV-Cov and MERS-Cov infection came to conflicting conclusions, since it might induce in-hospital secondary infection and long-term complications while inhibiting inflammation-related organ injury. With lack of conclusive evidence, the use of corticosteroids may be prudently considered in critical COVID-19 patients with clear evidence of immune overreaction, but their use is not generally recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Some have advocated against non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), notably ibruprofen, which may be associated with worse outcome with COVID-19, based on anecdotal reports. Targeted agents such as tocilizumab are also regarded as potential therapy. Tocilizumab was shown to facilitate chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy because it can inhibit IL-6, the core cytokine of cytokine storm syndrome [78]. Several clinical observations demonstrated a predominant increase of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients, which is associated with severe conditions [38,79], so inhibiting IL-6 activation may ease the overreacting immune system. Future well-designed RCTs are expected to clarify tocilizumab's efficiency and its applicable patients.",

For cardiovascular patients under regular anti-hypertensive treatment, it has been suggested that they should discontinue ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications. However, ACEI/ARB play a protective role in COVID-19, given that ACE2 shedding caused by SARS-Cov-2 invasion may result in its downregulation, following the activation of RAS axis which is partly responsible for severe organ injury in COVID-19 [48]. Thus far, there have been no clinical data supporting the case for ACEI/ARB discontinuation in COVID-19 patients. According to WHO's guideline, changing the routine antihypertensive therapy under the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid potential harm or pursue potential benefits is not recommended before any compelling evidence published.",

            "text": "Other therapies with less evidence-based foundation are also worth mentioning. Plasma treatment means transfusing convalescent plasma containing anti-virus polyclonal antibodies, and were proved to be effective in treating SARS patients and COVID-19 patients in observational studies [81,82]. Although the number of patients so treated is small, this does make scientific sense. Dilated horse anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro study [8]. Some traditional herbal therapies against coronavirus infection were found to be effective during SARS outbreak and are widely used in current practice in China [83]. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has shown both efficiency and safety in treating ARDS [84]. All the above therapies need more verification by RCTs [85], [86], [87], [88], [89]. Due to the widespread cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients, new or worsening heart failure is common especially in those with poor prognosis [79]. After recognizing the onset of heart failure, causes leading to decompensation should be evaluated first, especially those should which could be managed and corrected immediately such as acute coronary syndrome and severe rapid arrhythmias. Hypoxemia following pneumonia and ARDS is common in COVID-19 patients and will be worsened by heart failure. Thus oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation should be more rigorously used in COVID-19 patients with heart failure than those without. Diuretics should be considered under the evidence of volume overload, as well as renal replacement therapy which can simultaneously eliminate excessive cytokines. Rehydration should be more prudently prescribed in shock patients with COVID-19 than normal shock counterparts, considering that pulmonary edema following rapid fluid resuscitation will further impair alveolar ventilation. Mechanical assist devices such as intra-aortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may help patients get through critical periods and should be considered when necessary.",
