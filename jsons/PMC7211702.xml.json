She was initially managed as a case of Community Acquired Pneumonia, but was tagged as a Person Under Investigation (PUI) due to her occupation as a health provider. She was admitted in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, (converted to the hospital\u2019s COVID Critical Unit) with necessary precautions undertaken. During the first hospital day, she developed sudden onset of severe dysarthria and right upper and lower extremity weakness, giving a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 4. Plain cranial CT scan showed a subtle hypodensity in the left centrum semiovale and corona radiata (Fig 1\na). CT-angiography showed significant stenosis in the left M1 segment of the Middle Cerebral Artery (Fig 1b). Intravenous thrombolysis (IV rTPA) was initiated at a dose of 0.9mg/kg body weight 3.4 hours post ictus with 10% bolus of the total dose given initially, followed by the remaining dose as an infusion over 1 hour. Immediately after IV rTPA, the patient\u2019s right leg weakness resolved with an NIHSS of 3. Repeat plain cranial CT scan 24 hours post- IV rTPA showed absence of hemorrhage. Cautious hydration was made and Aspirin 100mg was started. However, on day 3 post ictus, his right leg was seen to be moving side to side with a cumulative NIHSS of 6. There were fluctuations in motor strength thereafter for which adjustment in IV hydration was made. She was confirmed COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) along with the classic findings on High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest showing areas of ground glass densities with focal areas of consolidation predominantly in both perihilar and peripheral regions of the lung (Fig 2\n). The patient is being managed for the COVID-19 infection and is still admitted with mild dysarthria, right upper extremity falls before 10 seconds and right lower extremity drift (NIHSS of 4). Laboratory tests are as follows (please refer to table 1\n.)",

[6], [7] Sars- CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract by inducing release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)1\u03b2 and IL-6 by binding to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR), triggering an inflammatory cascade and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Suppression of the inflammatory mediators have been shown to limit injury [12]. Increased inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, C-Reactive Protein and Fibrinogen) have been shown to increase stroke severity and disability within 30 days [13], while erythrocyte sedimentation rate has not been shown to predict the outcome of stroke [14]. Chest imaging of COVID-19 patients show consolidation, ground glass opacities and bilateral lung involvement, which were consistent with findings in our patient.[1], [6], [7] Diagnostic parameters of COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein which are seen in our patient (Table 1). These levels are directly proportional to the clinical outcome and mortality. Procalcitonin levels are normal unless there is a concomitant bacterial infection [1], [6], [7], [13].",

Possible mechanisms that may explain acute ischemic events in COVID-19 patients include cardiovascular compromise in the setting of infection, reduced oxygenation in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic inflammation causing thrombosis or plaque disruption. This patient had a coexisting cerebral vascular disease that may have an impact on the outcome of immediate treatment of stroke. Together with antithrombotics, the balance in hemodynamic status is paramount in treating such patients pre- and post- thrombolysis. Fluid management therefore remains a challenge among stroke patients who are COVID-19 positive as acute respiratory distress syndrome is a known potential sequelae, especially in those with multiple comorbidities. This reported case had severe stenosis in the left M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery which would make thrombolysis a better option as we anticipate the multisystemic problems that COVID patients are faced with. To mention, myocarditis, the second common mentioned cause of fatality next to severe lung infection may exacerbate heart failure. Vice versa, acute heart failure should also be evaluated for myocarditis as a primary complication of COVID-19.[10 Whether this is secondary to viral infiltration, or hypoxia and cytokine storm mounting in response to systemic infection[15], the aggressiveness in stroke management remains a priority because stroke is reversible.",

These occur on top of the already existing problem of shortage of healthcare professionals as they are inadvertently exposed and hence, quarantined.

There are no specific clinical guidelines established in handling COVID-19 positive patients who are eligible for thrombolysis. Management of hemodynamic status must always balance the risk and benefits of such treatment in COVID positive cases. There is no direct causal relationship of stroke with COVID-19 as of yet but given the fact that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to developing neurologic complications such as acute vascular events, monitoring these complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection is highly warranted. We therefore propose the following: 1) Development of an Acute Stroke Unit capable of managing COVID-19 patients and 2) Establishment of a clinical pathway and guidelines for the management of these complications in COVID-19 patients.",
