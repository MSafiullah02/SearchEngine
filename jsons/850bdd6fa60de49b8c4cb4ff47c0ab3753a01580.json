Similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2003, COVID-19 is an airborne illness that is highly transmittable between humans. Immediately after the Chinese government shared information about the virus publicly in late January 2020, stricter preventive measures, such as community quarantines and temporary business closures, swept across Chinese cities. The local outbreak quickly developed into an emerging public health crisis to the extent that World Health Organization (WHO) soon declared it as an unprecedented global pandemic. In March, Europe and the United States have successively become the epicenter of the pandemic, and many countries imposed restrictions on human mobility. As of March 23, 2020, infections were confirmed in 190 countries/territories/areas, totaling 332,930 cases, more than 14,510 deaths, and an exponentially growing number of suspected cases worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020).",

The Chinese hotel market witnessed a 71% year-over-year decline of occupancy in 23-26 January (Baker, 2020) . In this research note, we propose and calibrate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to understand the effect of infectious disease outbreak on tourism. By applying this model to the case of coronavirus pandemic, this study represents a pioneering research effort on evaluating the impact of coronavirus on tourism. Compared to time-series and econometric analyses, the DSGE model can depict nuanced interactions across market decision makers under the general equilibrium framework. In contrast to the computable general equilibrium model (Blake, Sinclair, & Sugiyarto, 2003) , decision makers in DSGE models optimize within a stochastic environment. Since the length and severity of the outbreak is uncertain, we believe it is more suitable to use DSGE model to address the impact of health crisis in this scenario.",

Households derive utility from consumption and health status (Hall & Jones, 2007) ; consumption is divided between tourism goods and generic goods. Households also combine health expenditure with leisure time to rebuild and accumulate health (Yagihashi & Du, 2015) , which is subject to disastrous risk during societal epidemics (World Health Organization, 2017). Producers consist of tourism goods producers and generic goods producers, with the latter providing products for generic consumption and health spending. The government balances its budget and enacts policies. More specific equations used in the DSGE model are detailed in our online Supplementary materials.",

A loss of health status would affect welfare directly, as health appears in the utility function, and indirectly by altering the consumption of tourism and generic goods (Barro, 2006) . Tourism consumption is related to health risks because tourists must travel and interact with crowds. Therefore, the dynamics of tourism consumption should follow the dynamics of economy-wide health status to some extent. Conversely, an epidemic outbreak would force the government to restrict travel due to associated health risks, and the degree of such restriction would depend on the overall health status. We capture the negative impact of an epidemic on tourism consumption by using x t along with the household health accumulation.",

In our baseline calibration, we identify a monthly disaster probability of 1.6%, implying that disaster occurs every 5 years on average.

As health disaster risk increases, we see a gradual deterioration in health status. As health status influences labor productivity, a declining health status leads to lower tourism and generic outputs. Apart from the supply side, tourism demand (C r ) also declines given its relationship with health risk, whether spontaneously or due to government-instituted bans on human mobility. To rebuild health, households begin to increase their health spending and leisure time while reducing their working time in the tourism and other sectors. More resources spent in the health sector cause health status to improve over time and eventually revert to the pre-shock level. These trends represent a typical path during the outbreak of a social-wide pestilence (World Health Organization, 2018). Fig. 1 also indicates how the economy evolves under different conditions relative to the persistence of health disaster risk. This figure plots the IRFs to a shock in \u03c9 t under three persistence scenarios: \u03c1 = 0.6 (baseline), \u03c1 = 0.4 (optimistic), and \u03c1 = 0.8 (pessimistic). Higher persistence means that the increase in health disaster risk endures, as the time path of \u03c9 t conveys. Fig. 1 also reveals that a longer and greater risk of health disasters pushes the tourism sector and the overall economy into an abyss. The peak points of decline in tourism sector output and labor are thus much lower, and the downturn lasts much longer, as risk persistence increases. More resources are hence needed to pull the economy out of trouble due to prolonged risk of a health disaster. Fig. 2 displays how the size of a disaster matters when the risk persistence is flat. This figure presents the IRFs to a shock in \u03c9 t with different disaster sizes: \u0394 = 10% (baseline), \u0394 = 5% (optimistic), and \u0394 = 15% (pessimistic). A larger disaster size corresponds to a larger share of post-outbreak health deterioration potentially. As indicated in Fig. 2 , all variables, including tourism sector output and labor, decline more as the disaster size increases. The persistence of this effect also changes, as it peaks at impact or at later points after the outbreak. The time paths in Figs. 1 and 2 closely resemble the comparison among COVID-19, SARS in 2003 , and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2014 (Peeri et al., 2020 .",

Because more resources are applied to restore health status, health demonstrates a swifter recovery overall.

As the coronavirus outbreak hinders tourism consumption and health status, welfare also declines, as presented in Fig. 4 . One possible policy to facilitate post-crisis tourism recovery is to subsidize tourism consumption. Such practices, like providing tourism consumption vouchers for residents, have been proved useful in China after the global financial crisis (Yan & Zhang, 2012) . From a general equilibrium perspective, tourism sector subsidies must be financed by resources redistributed from other sectors; therefore, higher tourism sector consumption would have a crowd-out effect. Our simulation result in Fig. 5 compares the baseline case to those involving a sectoral policy and comprehensive policy. A sectoral policy refers to one in which the tourism sector is subsidized two periods (quarters) after the outbreak, whereas a comprehensive policy includes simultaneous subsidies to the health sector as well. As indicated, the sectoral policy overcomes the tourism sector decline; however, such mitigation comes at the cost of a deeper recession in the generic sector. The rebuilding of health status is also weaker because resources are extracted from the health sector. Overall welfare declines accordingly. By contrast, the comprehensive policy improves tourism consumption and health rebuilding, albeit at the cost of regular consumption. Because health status plays a notable role in households' utility, general welfare improves.",
