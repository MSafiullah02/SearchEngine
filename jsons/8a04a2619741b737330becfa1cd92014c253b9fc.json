On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (2). By January 31, 2020, a total of 192 fatalities and 3,215 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in Wuhan; 8,576 additional cases were spread across >300 cities in mainland China, and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countries spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America. The rapid global expansion, rising fatalities, unknown animal reservoir, and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential (3, 4) initially resembled the 2003 SARS epidemic and raised concerns about global spread.",

            "text": "On January 22, 2020, China announced a travel quarantine of Wuhan and by January 30 expanded the radius to include 16 cities, encompassing a population of 45 million. At the time of the quarantine, China was already 2 weeks into the 40-day Spring Festival, during which residents and visitors make several billion trips throughout China to celebrate the Lunar New Year (5) . Considering the timing of exported COVID-2019 cases reported outside of China, we estimate that only 8.95% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 2.22%-28.72%) of persons infected in Wuhan by January 12 might have had COVID-19 confirmed by January 22. By limiting our estimate to infections occurring \u226510 days before the quarantine, we account for an \u22485-6-day incubation period and 4-5 days between symptom onset and case detection (Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/26/5/20-0146-App1.pdf) (2) (3) (4) 6) . The low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection (7) suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of Wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in China for days to weeks. Moreover, these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparent.",

Both estimates are consistent with a similar epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan (4).

By January 26, a total of 107 of these 130 high-risk cities had reported cases.

            "text": "Our conclusions are based on several key assumptions. To design our mobility model, we used data from Tencent (https://heat.qq.com), a major social media company that hosts applications including WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019) (Statista, https:// www.statista.com); consequently, our model might be demographically biased by the Tencent user base. Further, considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains. Our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of COVID-19 (4) and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for SARS (9) . We expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of COVID-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available (Appendix). However, our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties, including extensive prequarantine exportations throughout China and far greater case counts in Wuhan than those reported before the quarantine. I n January 2020, we investigated a 2-family cluster of persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the city of Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province, China. We attributed the infections to contact with an infected but potentially presymptomatic traveler from the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Our epidemiologic investigation was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Zhoushan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
