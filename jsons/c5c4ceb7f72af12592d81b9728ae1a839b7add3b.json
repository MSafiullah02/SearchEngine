Much research spanning >20 years shows a strong association between microorganisms including pathogens in asthma onset, severity and exacerbation, yet with the exception of antibiotics, few treatments are available that specifically target the offending pathogens. Recent insights into the microbiome suggest that modulating commensal organisms within the gut or lung may also be a possible way to treat/prevent asthma. The European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology Task Force on Anti-infectives in Asthma was initiated to investigate the potential of anti-infectives and immunomodulators in asthma. This review provides a concise summary of the current literature and aimed to identify and address key questions that concern the use of anti-infectives and both microbe-and host-based immunomodulators and their feasibility for use in asthma.",

Despite these important associations, the use of antiinfectives (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, vaccines) that specifically target known pathogens, or drugs that are based on or exploit microbe-host receptor interactions (toll-like receptor agonists, bacterial lysates) or are immunomodulators (vitamin D), and/or may work in part by altering our associated microbiology (probiotics) are, with the exception of severe asthma, seldom considered in asthma treatment, prevention and guidelines.

Anti-infectives (such as antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals) directly act on the pathogen or its receptor limiting infection or replication. Vaccines work by boosting both innate and importantly, adaptive immune responses (provided by dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes) to the pathogen providing longlasting protection. Immunomodulators including TLR agonists, BL, vitamin D act on the immune system, boosting innate immune responses providing short-term protection. Vitamin D may act on underlying immune responses, such as inflammatory responses or allergic inflammation, reducing pathogen-driven inflammation or pathogen-driven enhanced allergic inflammation. Microbiome modulators such as probiotics may alter the microbiome of the gut. This may have important downstream effects on the immune system, such as those that affect respiratory immunology and asthma the development of the immune system.

Three large cross-over trials show no evidence of increases in AEs in the two weeks following TIV in adults or children. 71 Concerns that LAIV could increase AEs, wheezing episodes and hospitalizations in children 70 were allayed the absence of an association of LAIV with AE in high-risk children. 72 F I G U R E 3 Challenges and unknowns facing new treatments for asthma exacerbations that target respiratory pathogens. Challenges facing the design and implementation of therapies that directly target pathogens or their biology (in blue) include site of infection and site of drug delivery, route of delivery, specific mechanism of action, the drug's pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) and also the patient demographic (Pt), subset or specific endophenotype of asthma concerned. These challenges can at least in part be addressed by preclinical studies and are often taken into account during drug design. Unknowns are also identified (in red) and can be model or pathogen specific. These include, but are not limited to, the window of therapeutic opportunity (Dt) for therapeutic treatments, which defines the time between infection and onset of clinical disease (LRTI symptoms for asthma), and importantly, this variable thus describes the window in which suppressing replication in theory will suppress symptoms and/or clinical disease. How pathogen load affects clinical disease is also controlled by a second variable (Dl), which defines the quantity of pathogen that has to be affected to observe a quantitative change in clinical disease or symptoms. The unknown c defines a comparison, between a new drug (eg antiviral) versus the standard treatment (eg GC). This unknown is important as regulatory authorities will not approve a new drug if does not show improvements or a better safety profile compared with the standard treatment already available. The unknown d represents duration of treatment; this takes into account other variables that are often difficult to predict and include the possible effects of secondary infections (eg bacterial co-infection), drug resistance (eg as seen with macrolides), plasticity of endophenotype treated and other complexities that can impact on clinical disease after pathogen load is decreased as defined by Dl. Theoretical relationships between pathogen and load and clinical disease are based on human challenge studies with RV, in asthmatic individuals 57,58",

This ancient surveillance network provides a form of first line of defence in the airway. 91 Signalling through TLRs produces a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and importantly, antimicrobial proteins. Therefore, precise targeting of individual TLR pathways could provide a mechanism of promoting specific immunity, allowing for tailored immunomodulation, an approach that is highly attractive in chronic diseases such as asthma where numerous immunological disparities are evident. withdrawal of inhaled GCs whilst asthma conditions remain stable or even improved. 101 The proposed mechanism is the restoration of the Th1/Th2 balance. However, supporting evidence is yet to be provided. A follow-up, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in poorly controlled, moderate-to-severe asthmatics where CYT003A was administered as an add-on to current GCs and b 2agonist therapy showed no significant advantage over placebo in relation to the primary outcome of change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in secondary outcomes of change from baseline in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ). 102 These data suggest that whilst CYT003A may have a use in initial control of disease in GC-sensitive patients, it has no efficacy as an add-on therapy for more severe patients. In addition, more prolonged administration of the TLR9 agonist, assessing its ability to readdress the supposed Th2 skewing, was not conducted. Additional concerns stem from recent reports of potential impairment of TLR9 function in PBMCs in severe asthmatic patients. 103 ",

[117] [118] [119] In view of two well-conducted meta-analyses, an opportunity of asthma/wheezing prevention with probiotics seemed to not be plausible. 118, 119 One may speculate, however, that the studies to date may not have used the right probiotic, the right dose, the right timing or duration and/or population. Therefore, more studies are still needed.",

For the clinical studies that have been performed with available anti-infectives or immunomodulatory agents, conclusions are often contradictory or show a lack of robust evidence supporting an effect. Reasons for these outcomes include a small number of studies, differences in study design making direct comparisons difficult or studies that are underpowered for primary or secondary endpoints, or subgroup analysis. As shown in Table 3 There is also a substantial body of literature investigating preclinical development of anti-infectives and immunomodulatory drugs and preparations in animal models, with many studies endeavouring to better understand the scientific principles behind their mechanism (s) of action. This is an absolute necessity in the anti-infective drug discovery pipeline; however, there is some confusion regarding how best to progress these anti-infectives in these studies in clinical trials, or alternatively, how interpretations of preclinical work can best inform on future clinical trials is a subject of wide debate. Much consideration still needs to be given to how future drug targets related to anti-infectives are progressed, and how drug discovery programmes are best implemented to exploit these.",

For influenza virus infection, approved treatments exist, but for RSV infection, there is only prophylaxis available for high-risk infants. These approaches are yet to be tested specifically in asthma. Intensive research is needed to develop clinically feasible antivirals against RV, as it is the main trigger of asthma. Another important point is suitable models to test new antivirals, and how these are implemented in antiviral testing and development. Recruiting and testing large patient numbers of asthmatics with a specific endophenotype in clinical trials of natural infections is logistically difficult. Virus challenge models that are available for RV 57,58 and RSV 34 may avoid some of these constraints, as lower numbers of patients are employed, but they are yet to be used specifically to test antivirals in asthma. This is an important discussion point, and the challenges and unknowns associated with these infection models are presented in Figure 3. These general points can be equally applied to other microorganisms. 4 | AN TIFUNGALS 4.1 | Severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) & Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)Up to 50% of adult asthmatics who remain inadequately controlled despite maximal doses of inhaled corticosteroids are sensitized to one or more filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus. This understanding has led to the term \"severe asthma with fungal sensitization\" (SAFS), which describes a grouping of asthmatics with severe disease but lacking some of the serological and radiological features of the related and more aggressive allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (eg IgE <1000 IU/mL, absence of bronchiectasis). Globally, almost 5 million asthmatics have evidence of ABPA, whilst many more have SAFS.59 Corticosteroids remain the backbone of treatment in both SAFS and ABPA; however, steroid side-effects including osteoporosis and diabetes have driven the search for alternative therapeutic options. Of these, the azole antifungal agents have been most widely investigated following the assumption that the allergic airways inflammation is primarily driven by the presence of airway fungal infection.",

In addition, a similar trial of voriconazole in a group of SAFS patients failed to show a significant clinical benefit, leaving the future of azole treatment in SAFS uncertain. 65 A possible alternative to azole therapy is the antifungal amphotericin B, which was first used in 1959 for a case of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Whilst published data remain largely limited to case reports, in a recent study of patients with SAFS or ABPA, nebulized amphotericin B failed to produce a clinical benefit in 18 of 21",

Studies in asthmatic children and adolescents addressing pneumococcal colonization, IPD burden, immune responses to pneumococcal vaccination and its potential benefit against AE are currently lacking. 77 In a 2002 Cochrane review, 78 only one study involving PPSV-23 vaccination of asthmatic patients was eligible for inclusion and reported fewer AEs followingvaccination. Another study did not observe a difference in the risk of hospitalization due to pneumococcal pneumonia following PPSV-23 vaccination comparing asthma patients to control subjects.79 5.3 | Experimental vaccines for RSV and RVVaccines for RV and RSV that are associated with AEs and asthma inception are lacking. RSV vaccine research has been hampered by formalin-inactivated RSV immunization trials in infants and children in 1966, which resulted in increased disease severity upon first natural RSV infection, with hospitalization of 80% of vaccinees and 2 deaths.80 Candidate vaccines against RSV, currently in clinical trials, include live attenuated viruses, gene-based vectors, RSV-F-nanoparticles and RSV-F subunit vaccines. Preclinical studies have identified a highly conserved RV capsid protein that induces cross-reactive cellular and humoral immune responses to heterologous RV strains,81 and may allow the development of a broadly cross-reactive subunit RV vaccine.",

Therefore, attempts were made to determine whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acute respiratory tract infections in healthy and asthmatic children. According to a systematic review, 112 children previously diagnosed with asthma may experience a 74% reduction in the risk of AE (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.59).112 More studies are needed to provide a larger and more powerful meta-analysis before the benefits of vitamin D can be stated with confidence.6.4 | Summary and outlookWhilst the efficacy of disease-modifying specific TLR stimulation and use of BL in stable asthma continues to be explored, there is a clear agenda for assessment of these agents in prevention of AE. Benefits for the use of TLR agonists include the potential ability to reshape long-standing immune responses/polarity; good PK/PD profiles; good stability and ease of delivery; and reduced risk of adverse effects. Several controlled clinical trials have been undertaken to explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma prevention and control, as well as respiratory tract infections. In view of the recent randomized controlled trials, vitamin D cannot be recommended as adjunctive therapy for asthma or asthma prevention.Nevertheless, its preventive activity, particularly in AEs, seems promising.Probiotics are preparations of live microorganisms that may colonize the intestinal tract and/or compete with pathogens, and may also stimulate the immune system. An interesting aspect of the immunostimulatory effects of probiotics is their ability to lower the number of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that may lead to AE. In this respect, probiotics were superior to placebo in diminishing the incidence of acute URTIs in the general population.113,114 Despite several methodological issues, this concept definitely warrants further investigations in asthma.Animal studies have shown that modification of the microbiota modulates the systemic immune responses of the host, resulting in lower sensitization rates and reducing allergic inflammation.",
