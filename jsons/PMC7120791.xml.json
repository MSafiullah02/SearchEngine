            "text": "If cross-species transplantation is ever to become a reasonable therapeutic modality for human beings, it will be because the potential for success has been demonstrated in a nonhuman primate model. The imperative has always been to select a primate research subject from a species that is plentiful, is not endangered, readily procreates in a managed environment, and mimics the human response (immunologic homology) to both organ transplantation and potential transfer of infectious disease. Several Papio subspecies of baboons, including Papio hamadryas anubis (olive baboon), meet these important criteria. These animals remain ubiquitous throughout sub-Saharan Africa and have adapted well to the managed environments of major primate centers worldwide. A list of United States-based primate centers housing breeding colonies of baboons can be found in Table 19.1. The Surgical Research Laboratory at Loma Linda University, for instance, has maintained a salutary relationship with the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, Texas, for the procurement of juvenile baboon research subjects.\n\n",

Nevertheless, the olive baboon and its closest relatives remain vital to laboratory investigation of xenotransplantation. Their most important laboratory role may be as recipients of solid organ xenografts, including heart, lung, liver, and kidney. Host immunoregulatory strategies that are efficacious with baboon recipients are, in many instances, directly applicable to the human setting. Maintenance of chronic immunoregulation and graft surveillance is much more difficult in baboons, however, whose feral nature makes them much less cooperative than human recipients. Baboon recipient mortality and morbidity are reflective of the experience in humans, as are measures of immune response. Baboons are susceptible to most of the same, or similar, infectious agents that threaten human subjects. Hence, they represent an important analogy to the threat of infections facing human recipients. They also represent an excellent model for the potential of infectious disease transfer in clinical trials of xenotransplantation. Finally, beyond their important role as laboratory recipients, baboons may have substantial potential value as organ and cellular xenodonors.",

While recipient survival was limited in each of these pilot experiments (excepting the bone marrow transplant), a great many scientific and philosophical lessons were learned from each one. Importantly, no public health crisis evolved from any of these experiments.",

Naturally occurring recipient antibody may be removed temporarily by: (1) using extracorporeal adsorption on a carbohydrate or immunoadsorption column (Taniguchi et al.,1996; Alwayn et al.,1999; Brenner et al.,2000), (2) pre-treating the primate host with norfloxacin to remove bowel aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (Ma\u00f1ez et al.,2001), or (3) neutralizing them by repeated infusions of anti-idiotypic antibody preparations (McMorrow et al.,2002). Interestingly, anti-idiotypic antibody generated against human Gal\u03b11,3Gal antibodies is highly cross-reactive with baboon sera, suggesting that the baboon immune composition is a reasonable facsimile of that observed in human hosts.",

The roles of several immunocytes, including natural killer cells, activated T and B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and granulocytes, are under investigation (Dehoux et al.,2001). While hyperacute rejection relates largely to pre-existing antibody and the triggering of intravascular coagulation, delayed acute rejection is produced, in part, by a profound, and as yet, poorly characterized innate cellular immune response that is both antibody-dependent and independent. The baboon response, both ex vivo and in vivo, appears to mirror that expected of human hosts.",

And, because they are readily available and because their immune response and adaptation to immunoregulation and antimicrobial therapy mimics that observed in humans, baboons have become a highly desirable model for the study of solid organ xenotransplantation. Baboons have been used as hosts for orthotopic and heterotopic heart, lung, liver, and kidney xenotransplantation. The vast majority of recent investigations involve baboon recipient survival and the characterization and manipulation of the primate immune response to organ transplants derived from commercially produced transgenic pigs. Thus far, baboon host and pig graft survivals have been measured in days or weeks. Most recent graft survival in a modified pig-to-primate model is about 60 days.

Of these, viruses and even prions (since barnyard animals have become potential donors) are of significant concern in xenotransplantation and public health circles.

They may or may not produce disease in their natural host, but several examples (e.g., Ebola, SARS, influenza, spongiform encephalopathy, monkey pox, and possibly HIV) have produced illness and death among inadvertently exposed human beings. Some of these and other viruses are (or may be) capable, through horizontal transmission, of producing profound global public health consequences.

There is particular concern about endogenous virus particles that seem to exist as an important piece of the genetic code of a species (e.g., PERV, or porcine endogenous retrovirus). Experimentation in baboons should help define the true importance of each fear. Baboon recipient models will undoubtedly play a role in determining each specific donor animal\u2019s potential for producing or transmitting conventional or novel viral illnesses to human patients.",

While size is important for short-term and terminal experiments, it is an even more vital factor when long-term support, maintenance, and surveillance are at stake. Juvenile baboons are easier for the transplant research team to manage and are generally less hazardous to their surroundings and their caregivers than are their adult counterparts. They require less transfusion volume during major operations, particularly those using cardiopulmonary bypass. They are easier to sedate and anesthetize. One or two full-size adult baboons, utilized as blood donors, will usually suffice for a vigorous xenotransplantation research laboratory.",

Anesthesia for operative procedures in baboons is administered much as that for human infants and children in the hospital setting. While protocols vary from laboratory to laboratory, all teams use some form of dissociation (ketamine) and sedation (Zolasepam and Tiletamine) prior to endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia is then maintained with inhalation agents, including N2O2 and isofluorane. Depth and control of anesthesia is monitored by using indwelling groin arterial and venous catheters and electrocardiography. An arterial blood gas is useful for making initial ventilator adjustments, but blood sampling and blood wasting must be kept to a minimum in juvenile baboons, which possess small blood volumes. Additional venous infusion catheters are inserted into the dorsal arm veins.",

Invasive devices, therefore, are completely withdrawn as the animal emerges from anesthesia. Orthotopic heart transplantation, for example, is accomplished with excellent operative outcomes using this less restrictive approach. Other specific surgical research protocols may require more contained or invasive perioperative management. Most animals will not require post-operative intravenous fluids and intense monitoring to assure their operative survival. Close observation is important, however, particularly for assessment of the animal\u2019s discomfort. Pain is controlled using regular injections of a narcotic during the initial 12\u201324 h, and, on occasion, thereafter depending upon an individual animal\u2019s needs. Baboons are quite intuitive about the timing of post-operative oral intake of water and food, hence both may be made available to them during the early perioperative period. Baboons are usually capable of being returned to maintenance quarters within 24 h of an operation, where treats such as favorite fruits are provided.",

Using immunoregulatory strategies readily adaptable to a clinical protocol for additional baboon-to-human infant xenotransplants, laboratory host survival has consistently exceeded a year, and in some cases has extended beyond 2 years. Growth of both the baboon hosts and their xenografts has been documented (Matsumiya et al.,1996b). Despite the complexities of a chronic immunosuppression and surveillance protocol in the baboon model, the animals have experienced a vigorous existence while entirely dependent upon their xenohearts. Death from xenograft rejection has been uncommon.

Guidelines and safeguards for this type of research should be established, and investigators should thoroughly examine the potential for infectious disease transfer from animal donor to human recipient and beyond.
