Here we report for the first time the occurrence of fusion of cells within a tissue exposed in vivo to permeabilizing electric pulses. The dependence of electrofusion on the ratio of applied voltage to distance between the electrodes, and thus on the achievement of in vivo cell electropermeabilization (electroporation) is demonstrated in the metastasizing B16 melanoma tumor model. The kinetics of the morphological changes induced by cell electrofusion (appearance of syncytial areas or formation of giant cells) are also described, as well as the kinetics of mitosis and cell death occurrence. Finally, tissue dependence of in vivo cell electrofusion is reported and discussed, since electrofusion has been observed neither in liver nor in another tumor type. Particular microenvironmental conditions, such as the existence of reduced extracellular matrices, could be necessary for electrofusion achievement. Since biomedical applications of in vivo cell electropermeabilization are rapidly developing, we also discuss the influence of cell electrofusion on the efficacy of DNA electrotransfer for gene therapy and of antitumor electrochemotherapy, in which electrofusion could be an interesting advantage to treat metastasizing tumors. \u00df",

            "text": "Spontaneous cell fusion among animal cells occurs during certain stages of the developmental program, like in the case of the generation of muscle \u00a2bers by myoblast fusion. Otherwise, cells in tissues do not fuse in spite of close contacts between them. There are two main reasons for the absence of cell fusion in tissues. First, the external matrix of the cells constitutes a physical obstacle to the fusion. Second, the structure of the lipid bilayers, with external hydrophilic layers at both sides of the internal hydrophobic core, prevents the spontaneous fusion of intact lipid bilayers. However, fusion between the plasma membrane and the membrane of cell internal vesicles, as well as fusion between membranes of di\u00a1erent internal vesicles, or \u00a2ssion (e.g., at Golgi tubular networks), constantly occur in the living eucaryotic cells. Indeed, fusion and \u00a2ssion sustain membrane tra\u00a4c, endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as intracellular transport in general. The mechanisms underlying the`internal' fusions and \u00a2ssions are still under analysis: vesicle fusion occurs mainly on the basis of SNAREs proteins interactions [1] , but other proteins, like the SM proteins or the Rab proteins might also be involved (reviewed in [2] ). These proteins can also directly contribute to membrane fusion [1] , like the spike protein of murine coronaviruses [3] or other viral proteins [2] . In spite of rapid accumulation of new results, the membrane fusion mechanisms are not yet fully described. Recently the role of the lipids has been pointed out because membrane \u00a2ssion of Golgi tubular networks has been shown to depend also on the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid by speci\u00a2c proteins [4] . However, the mechanisms underlying the fusion of intact plasma membranes of two di\u00a1erent cells, like in the case of the myoblast, are still unknown at the molecular level.",

This last approach, termed electrofusion, is based on cell electropermeabilization [7] (also termed electroporation), which is caused by the increase in transmembrane poten-tial imposed by the application to the cells of external electric \u00a2elds [8] . Reversible cell electropermeabilization corresponds to the transient and reversible modi\u00a2cation of the plasma membrane structure [9] . In vitro, this mod-i\u00a2cation has several biological consequences as well as some biotechnological and biomedical applications [10, 11] : (i) increase of membrane permeability to non-permeant or low-permeant molecules, (ii) electroinsertion into the membrane of proteins possessing transmembrane domains, or (iii) electrofusion of cells.",

They were usually located in the center of the tumor cell, symmetrically surrounded by cytoplasm (Fig.  1A ,B). The membrane limiting each individual cell was clearly visible. On the contrary, in electrically treated tumors, 70 h after the delivery of permeabilizing EP, completely di\u00a1erent patterns could be detected (Fig. 1C^H ). The nuclei were reassembled in a common cytoplasm forming polynuclear giant cells. These giant cells con-tained several nuclei in close contact (a maximum of 64 nuclei was counted in one case, see Fig. 1H ), organized in two di\u00a1erent categories: (i) patterns with a large cytoplasm and a peripheral ring of multiple nuclei ; (ii) patterns with multiple nuclei arranged randomly in the center. At 70 h after EP delivery (1350 V/cm), 4.8% of the nuclei (observed randomly as described in Section 2) were included in giant cells containing more than one nucleus. This was in clear contrast with the situation observed in the control tumors removed from the mice either at the time of the treatment of the treated tumors or 70 h later. Indeed in each of these control situations, out of the 1700 cells counted, no cell was found to contain more than one nucleus. Nevertheless, the complete examination of all the control sections showed that in controls, very few tumor cells did contain two nuclei. the nuclei distribution was observed. However, two mod-i\u00a2cations were detected: the appearance of syncytial areas and the formation of giant cells. In the syncytial areas, the membranes separating the cells were no longer detectable (Fig. 2B,C) . In the \u00a2rst hours after EP delivery, this mod-i\u00a2cation was the predominant one. In the giant cells (Fig.  2D^F) , the cytoplasm is clearly limited by a continuous membrane and the number of nuclei in each giant cell could be easily counted. Contrarily to the syncytial areas, giant cells were not abundant 1 h after tumor electric treatment.",

In parallel, fusion was detected in almost all the sections (16 out of 18 sections examined at 15 h after EP delivery). Previous experiments have also shown that the B16 tumors were only weakly a\u00a1ected by bleomycin when pulses of an amplitude of 500 V/cm were used. Thus we were expecting that only few cells were permeabilized at this low amplitude, instead of a large majority of the cells at 1350 V/cm. We con\u00a2rmed this situation using the permeabilization test based on the e\u00a1ects of high doses of bleomycin on the electropermeabilized cells. In agreement with the non-homogeneity of the electric \u00a2eld distribution when plate electrodes are applied over a more or less spherical tumor (the highest amplitude of local electric amplitudes being found the closest to the electrodes, model not shown), permeabilization was observed only in restricted areas. In parallel, at 500 V/cm, patterns revealing cell electrofusion in B16 tumors (Fig. 6) were not detected on the whole of the tumors sections, but only in de\u00a2ned regions that could correspond to the parts of the tumors which were permeabilized. Thus, in combination with the facts that (i) the number of nuclei per giant cell at 15 h using pulses of 500 V/cm was just one fourth of the number of nuclei detected using pulses of 1350 V/cm, and that (ii) syncytial areas were not detected at 500 V/cm, it can be concluded that, as expected from the theory and the in vitro results, extent of in vivo electrofusion seems to be closely related to the extent of cell electropermeabilization.",

It is interesting to note that in the B16 tissue exposed to the permeabilizing electric pulses the disappearance of the limits between adjacent cells was already detected at the earliest time analyzed (1 h). At that time, no change in nuclei distribution in the overall B16 tissue was detectable. Later on, nuclei distribution in the tissue changed, separation between the cells became clear, and it was possible to detect typical giant cells similar to those obtained after cell fusion in vitro [37] . The nuclei were either all located in one group in the center of the cell, or located at the cell periphery, forming a circular pearl chain around the center of the cell. In both cases, the stain of the cytoplasm was more homogeneous and intense. The \u00a2rst signs of nuclei redistribution were observed at 3 h after EP delivery. Ten hours after EP, the morphological changes were completed. These morphological changes thus occurred very slowly with respect to the initial membrane perturbation, like in vitro, where it was shown that the completion of the process requires several hours and corresponds to large rearrangements of the cytoskeleton [21] .",

To our knowledge there is no report on fusions in mammalian tissues other than developmental fusions, such as the myoblast transforming into myotubes, or pathological fusions, like the generation of multinucleated giant cells, a characteristic feature of tuberculosis granulomas formed by the fusion of monocytes or macrophages [37] .",

Obviously, these giant cells should be subject to cell death because their electropermeabilization, which generated their fusion, should also permit cytotoxic drug uptake. However, in the case of a non-homogeneous distribution of the cytotoxic drug, or of an insu\u00a4cient local supply, cell death could also occur in the cells not loaded with the drug, because, as shown here, mitoses in giant cells are altered and the death of cells in syncytial areas is triggered even in absence of cytotoxic drugs. Thus, cell electrofusion could be an important advantage of the in vivo delivery of EP to metastasizing tumors.",
