On January 7, 2020, the identification of a new virus, named SARS-CoV-2, was announced (WHO, 2020a). The disease, known as COVID-19, produces mild symptoms in most people, but can also lead to severe respiratory illness. On January 23, authorities have quarantined the city of Wuhan and, by the end of January, authorities had enforced restrictions in at least fifteen additional cities in Hubei Province. Cases were recorded in every province-level subdivision in China and, in a few weeks, the virus had spread to dozens of other countries in Asia. The United States reported the first coronavirus case on January 20, in the Washington State, and, on January 24, the first cases were reported in Europe (Spain, France and Italy) (Hopkins, 2020). Latin American was free of the virus until February. The first case confirmed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (on February 25) was a 61-years old man who had travelled to Lombardy, northern of Italy (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020). On March 5, the Argentinian Ministry of Health reported the first coronavirus case, a 43-years old man who has also visited Italy (Argentina, 2020). Since then, the virus has spread all over the world: in Africa, Asia, America, Europe and Oceania (Hopkins, 2020).",

On March 19, a new decree determined that bars, restaurants, beaches, shopping centers and commerce in general (except for food and medicines) should be shut from March 21. Public transport within the city was limited as well as part of the passenger's transport within states. Industrial activities were not suspended, as well as all activities related to health and basic services (DOERJ, 2020). Similar restrictions were adopted in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.",

During the first quarantine week, in Rio de Janeiro, public transport had a reduction of approximately 50% and private vehicles were significantly reduced (Cyberlab, 2020). The containment measures had a huge impact in the daily life of the citizens, but they also had a positive impact on air quality (Saadat et al., 2020). Satellite images recorded in March and April 2020 showed a clear decrease in particulate matter in the metropolitan areas of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Pollutant concentrations depend on emissions, but also on meteorological conditions, transport, deposition and atmospheric chemistry, so a direct relation between satellite images for a single day and emissions cannot be done. Anyway, the same results had been observed in China, Italy, Spain, France and other areas of the world (Copernicus, 2020; NASA, 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020).",

The city is divided by the Tijuca Massif in the southern and northern regions. The south, a typical urban area with residential and commercial buildings and predominance of vehicular emission sources, receives winds from the Atlantic Ocean. The north of the city receives air masses from the main industries in the MRRJ: metallurgical and steel industries in the western zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro (Santa Cruz and Campo Grande districts), pharmaceutical, chemical, plastic and metallurgical industries in the northern area (cities of Belford Roxo and Nova Iguac\u00fa) and the city of Duque de Caxias (northeastern area), with more than 800 industries in several sectors, such as chemistry, petrochemistry, oil refining, fuel storage, power generation, gas production, plastic and metallurgy (Dantas et al., 2020).",

Tijuca, also located in the northern area, near the Tijuca Forest mountains (Tijuca Massif) predominantly receives weak mountain breezes from the south and pollutants due to local vehicular emissions.

In general, primary pollutant concentrations showed a decrease in the first days of the lockdown. The differences observed between them can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in Rio de Janeiro. According to the last emission inventory for the MRRJ, mobile emissions account for 98, 67.3, 66.5 and 42.3% of total emissions of CO, HC, NOx and PM10, respectively (INEA, 2016). Mean values for Brazil, estimated in the last national inventory of vehicular emission, showed that 47 and 46% of CO and NMHC, respectively, are emitted by light-duty vehicles (LDV). Motorcycles also contribute with a high fraction (34 and 25% of CO and NMHC). Heavy-duty vehicles (trucks and buses), fueled by diesel, contribute to 91 and 96% of NOx and particulate matter emitted by vehicular sources, respectively (NEI, 2014). During the partial lockdown, trucks continue to run since industrial and construction activities were maintained as well as the transport of food and cargo in general. The fleet of buses was partially reduced while passengers' cars circulations had a 70\u201380% decrease in the first lockdown week (03/23\u201303/29) and then raised to approximately 50% (Fiocruz, 2020). Then, a higher decrease in CO and NMHC should be expected, mainly for the period of 03/23/2020 to 03/29/2020, as will be discussed later. Ozone concentrations, the main secondary pollutant in Rio de Janeiro, markedly increased, mainly in Tijuca and Iraj\u00e1, as expected considering previous results obtained during a ten-day truck driver strike (Dantas et al., 2019).",

For CO, values were 15.2% lower and 12% higher in Bangu and Tijuca, respectively. The increase in primary pollutant levels in Iraj\u00e1 and Tijuca can be attributed to the small reduction in the traffic and people circulation in the city. Meteorological conditions as a high atmospheric pressure system, high temperatures and absence of rains until March 20 could contribute to the increase in pollutant concentrations. Winds from the north-northwest also favored the transport of pollutants to Iraj\u00e1 and Tijuca. As an example, air masses arriving in Iraj\u00e1 were simulated using the dispersion model Hysplit implemented by the Air Resources Laboratory - NOAA e Australian Bureau of Meteorology (HYSPLIT, 2020; Rolph et al., 2017). Using a backward dispersion model, air masses arriving at 8:00 (local time, BRT) from the north-northwest were modelled (Fig. S7 Supplementary Material). The air mass trajectory passed through the industrial areas of Nova Igua\u00e7\u00fa and Belford Roxo and over the main highways BR-101 and 116, and also through several avenues and the expressways Linha Vermelha and Avenida Brasil, with intense traffic of both light and heavy-duty vehicles. The monitoring station of Bangu, located in the west area (see Fig. 1), between the massifs of Pedra Branca and Gericin\u00f3-Mendanha, received winds from the west area and was not impacted by the vehicular emissions of the main avenues and highways.",

            "text": "As expected, the decrease in PM10 and NO2 was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as the transport of air masses and meteorological parameters. Moreover, the traffic of trucks and other cargo vehicles was not reduced since supermarkets, drug and construction materials stores continued the activities as well as industries and gasoline stations. These vehicles fueled with diesel are the main contributors to PM10 and NO2. Urban buses circulation was only partially reduced (approximately 50%). Considering the last emission inventory for the MRRJ (INEA, 2016) emissions of PM10 and NO2 are mainly due to heavy-duty vehicles. Trucks contribute to 49.8 and 32.1% of PM10 and NO2 emissions, respectively, while urban buses account for 42.6 and 50.6%. The lower decrease for particulate matter levels in comparison to NO2 is probably due to the highest contribution of trucks which continue circulating within the city. Other sources such as construction works, industrial emissions, dust resuspension and transport from the vegetated areas (rainforest) could also contribute to particulate matter emission. Recently, Tobias et al. (2020) reported similar results for the city of Barcelona (Spain). The decrease in CO levels was lower than the reduction of light-duty vehicles flux. In part, these results may be due to a surge in demand for food and package delivery services which led to the increase in motorcycles use.",

Since NMHC/NOx ratios were approximately equal in the period of March 02\u201322, the increase in ozone concentrations was probably related to air masses entering from the northern industrial area. As recently discussed by Dantas et al. (2020), the reactivity of the volatile organic compounds (VOC) mixture in Iraj\u00e1 is highly increased by industrial air masses rich in aromatic compounds (such as alkyl-substituted benzene and xylene isomers). During the fourth and fifth weeks, the sharp decrease in NO2 concentrations (53.9 and 19.7%, respectively) lead to an increase in ozone, since atmospheric chemistry in Rio de Janeiro is under VOC-controlled conditions. In April, as previously discussed, the levels of all pollutants had a small variation due to the relaxation of social isolation measures. In Bangu, NMHC remained with small variations and the increase of ozone levels may be attributed to the decrease in nitrogen oxides (Geraldino et al., 2020).",

The main restrictions were applied from March 23, however, in April, social isolation was relaxed in spite of the recommendations of WHO, scientist and medical experts and also state's governments. The partial confinement of the population, reduction of road traffic and economic activity led to the decrease in CO and NO2 levels and, by contrast, to the increase in ozone concentrations. Similar results had been observed in 2018, during a 10-day truck driver strike. Since particulate matter and ozone are, in general, the pollutants of main concern in Rio the Janeiro, these results suggest that the assessment of air quality policies in the city requires the analysis of air masses transported from the industrial areas as well as the study of VOC speciation and the impact of NMHC/NOx ratios on ozone levels, considering that the high temperatures and solar radiation indexes favor ozone formation. The impact of meteorological conditions cannot be neglected and should be analyzed in the future.",
