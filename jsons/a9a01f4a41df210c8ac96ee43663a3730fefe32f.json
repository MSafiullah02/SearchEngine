Patients at risk for multidrugresistant pathogens or with a prior history of such, as well as patients at high risk for mortality at the time of presentation (septic shock or pneumonia requiring ventilator support) should be prescribed two anti-pseudomonal agents from different classes until further information from the cultures is available [1] . Beta-lactam antibiotics with anti-pseudomonal coverage include cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillintazobactam, or a carbapenem with anti-pseudomonal activity such as meropenem or imipenem. Aztreonam can be used as an alternative agent in patients with a documented penicillin allergy. A second anti-pseudomonal agent can be either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone; however, neither of these antibiotics should be used as sole agents. Aminoglycoside monotherapy for the treatment of pneumonia is not recommended due to poor lung penetration and alveolar concentration, prompting higher antibiotic dosing that potentially can lead to nephro-and ototoxicity [1, 27] . Fluoroquinolone monotherapy is discouraged due to the increasing rate of resistance to this particular antibiotic class. Agents with MRSA coverage, vancomycin or linezolid, should also be included into the initial treatment regimen of pneumonia. In neutropenic cancer patients with a true community-acquired pneumonia or an early hospital acquired pneumonia, an agent with coverage against atypical pathogens such as Legionella spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydophila pneumoniae should be included into the regimen. Fluoroquinolones, doxycycline or azithromycin should be a part of the regimen in such clinical scenarios [28] .",

Due to the side effect of pancytopenia, ganciclovir is generally contraindicated in the settings of severe neutropenia or a pre-engraftment phase of HSCT [31, 32] . For the treatment of influenza A and B infections, neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir are recommended [31] . RSV pneumonia is typically treated with aerosolized, oral or intravenous ribavirin [31, 33, 34] . Addition of intravenous immunoglobulin may further reduce mortality in this patient population [35] . In high-risk patients with severe human metapneumovirus (hMPV) pneumonia, ribavirin treatment may be used as well but the use of this agent remains controversial [31, 36] . For the treatment of parainfluenza virus (PIV), the use of ribavirin has been described in the literature; albeit without any evidence of reduced mortality [37] . Treatment with interferon Alpha-2b for severe PIV pneumonia may be another promising therapeutic option that needs to be studied further [38] .",
