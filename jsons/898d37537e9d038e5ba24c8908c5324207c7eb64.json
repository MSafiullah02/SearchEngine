            "text": "A number of new taxonomic proposals have been considered by the Executive Committee of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) since publication of its Sixth Report in 1995 [2] . Several of these proposals were ratified subsequently at the Plenary Meeting of the ICTV during the Tenth International Congress of Virology in Jerusalem in August 1996. Others have been ratified by postal ballot of the full membership of the ICTV subsequent to a meeting of the Executive Committee of the ICTV in Strasbourg in May 1997. Table 1 presents the current version of the Universal System of Virus Taxonomy which includes the new taxonomic proposals which have been ratified by the ICTV up to the end of 1997 [1] . This is an abbreviated version of the up-dated taxonomy; it does not extend to the listing of approved virus species, a feature which is expanding rapidly. A major revision of virus taxonomy is being undertaken currently by the individual Study Groups of the ICTV, which is scheduled to be published as the Seventh Report of the ICTV prior to the Eleventh International Congress of Virology in Sydney in 1999.",
