Transmission rates can be explained by seasonal weather conditions, but this does not account for observed variations in fatality rates. Many factors point to Vitamin D as a candidate explanation but historical controversy surrounding Vitamin D studies and the lack of a coherent framework for causal inference has hampered acceptance of this explanation despite a wealth of evidence in its favour.",

Available data for all four countries suggest that a common link is relatively low Vitamin D deficiency levels [4] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Canada may also benefit from a low population density. Japan has a very high population density but has the lowest incidence of Vitamin D deficiency which is attributed to its high fish-content diet. The reason behind the other countries is less clear but presumed to be lifestyle, diet and nationwide policy on supplementation. A lack of more recent data and issues with inconsistent testing methods and definitions make it difficult to assert this with certainty. Nonetheless, the broad pattern of serum 25(OH)D correlations with outbreak severity appears to hold consistently and account for outliers across the full latitude range.",

Phillipine Dr Mark Alipio recently published a (preprint) retrospective multicentre study of 212 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 from three hospitals in Southern Asian countries. Data pertaining to clinical features and serum 25(OH)D levels were extracted from the medical records. Alipio concludes, \"Vitamin D status is significantly associated with clinical outcomes (p<0.001). For each standard deviation increase in serum 25(OH)D, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a severe outcome were increased approximately 7.94 times; the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a critical outcome were increased approximately 19.61 times,\" indicating that, in COVID-19 patients, increased serum 25(OH)D level could improve clinical outcomes, and/or mitigate the worst (severe to critical) outcomes.

Modern techniques, such as the \"front door criterion\" enabled deconfounding of even unknown or unmeasured variables through the use of mediator variables.

Cyclic dependencies can't be handled by DAG causal models which are \"acyclic\" by definition. The acyclic restriction is necessary for quantitative analysis because cyclic dependencies (positive or negative feedback loops) are mathematically very complex to model . However they can be analysed 4 qualitatively and the relationship is worthy of discussion. It's clear from the viral cycle that anything that controls disease severity, reduces the number of viral particles, or lowers the probability of infection will suppress the feedback loop. Environmental conditions hostile to virus particle survival will reduce transmission rates; Isolation, quarantine and social distancing measures similarly. Neither is expected to reduce 3 Any challenges to the assertion of independence can be handling by modifying the diagram appropriately or similarly considering the expected nature of the impacts. 4 Sophisticated techniques using DCGs have been developed recently that can handle cyclic dependencies.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related pneumonia, while also causing acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via ACE2 receptors in cells [41] in epithelial cells in the lungs. Studies of related coronaviruses show that viral replication downregulates ACE2 [42] . This dysregulates the RAS since it depends on the counterbalancing effects of ACE and ACE2: as ACE2 is depleted the RAS becomes over-activate, resulting in a cytokine storm in the host which causes ARDS [43] [44] . 5 Influenza: old and new threats.

She teaches Public Health at the University of Cambridge Background to this paper In response to the urgency of the unfolding crisis, on 23rd March, 2020, we published an early online report [67] outlining evidence supporting a beneficial role for Vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, calling for hospitals to test serum levels, treat deficiency and report data and outcomes. Response to the report was highly polarised. Those critical of it were quick to dismiss citing \"correlation isn't causation\". The report contained direct and indirect evidence for cause but lacked a formal framework justifying causal inference which has slowed the adoption of this critical information. A causal inference framework has a great deal of value to add beyond the current pandemic. Vitamin D has received a great deal of renewed attention in recent years, but a beneficial role for it in disease states has been controversial [68] . Vitamin D deficiency is association with many serious diseases has raised the question of whether it is a bystander, simply a general marker of illheath, or plays an active role in the cause and progression of diseases. The lack of standardised serum level testing and a long history of research and clinical trials with significant design flaws adds significant noise and confusion to the body of research making {DOI} Page 23 of 30",

If so, the size of the causal effect can be calculated.",

            "text": "CI employs causal diagrams (models) which are mathematically and graphically represented by \"directed acyclic graphs\" (DAGs). These network-like diagrams of connected nodes declare the flow of causes-to-effects in the model, and CI's new symbolic language makes it possible to mathematically express and answer the causal questions we wish to pose. Formal rules dictate how DAGs are created, manipulated and interpreted soundly, and CI gives ways to test models for correctness and identify potential flaws. CI formally distinguishes seeing from doing , (adding a \"do-operator\") which allows for a new, highly-succinct definition of \"confounding\" as: the difference between seeing X and doing X on an outcome (Y). If seeing and doing are equal in outcomes, there is no confounding, otherwise there is. Prior to CI, statistics has been unsuccessful in clearly, succinctly and correctly defining confounding. The nature of confounding was ironically itself confounding. The purpose of a causal model is to explain the underlying process generating the observed data. The process of drawing and iterating DAGs brings clarity and interpretability to what can otherwise be highly-confusing data. Most importantly, models generate predictions which are testable against observed data and can be verified or falsified. Model relationships can be expressed mathematically to calculate the expected size of a causal effect purely from observed data with remarkable accuracy [70] . Models help to identify spurious correlations and also show when inference is not possible. A credible causal model must first be defined then analysed to identify potential confounding variables, and any variables that may appear to be confounders but are not. Confounding variables can be \"controlled for\" 6 enabling the deconfounding of statistics. Models help to identify variables that should not be controlled for (colliders), since doing so may inadvertently introduce selection bias. CI gives us the power to interpret the size of causal effects from correlations in observational data.",
