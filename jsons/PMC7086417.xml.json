Although they have similar incidence rate in developed and developing countries, the mortality rate is higher in developing countries [1\u20133]. ARIs are responsible for approximately 20% of all deaths in children under 5 years in 2006; about 70% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and the southern regions of Asia. Viruses are the main causative agents of respiratory infection, but bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause them as well. The leading ARI-causing viruses are rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4], with RSV affecting mainly infants under 1 year of age [5, 6].",

Viral infection can have multiple clinical manifestations, such as pneumonia, defined as an inflammation of the lung parenchyma. This condition is often associated with visible changes on chest X-rays, CT scanning, or gallium scanning and with abnormalities in alveolar gas exchange. The presentations of viral pneumonia vary considerably depending on the age and immunological competence of the host, as well as the viral pathogen. Viral pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immune compromised individuals and children [7]. The clinical presentation depends on the specific causative agent but typically includes fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms, such as tachypnoea, nonproductive cough, wheeze, and increased breath sound [7, 8].",

Airway problems are most common in infections caused by parainfluenza viruses, RSV, and human metapneumovirus [1, 8, 17]. Bronchiolitis occurs predominantly in the first year of life and with decreasing frequency in the second and third years. It is characterized by inflammatory obstruction of the small airways and hyperinflation of the lungs and typically presents along with breathing problems and wheezing. RSV is the primary causative agent of bronchiolitis worldwide, causing between 70 or 80 percent of ARIs during the high season [18\u201320]. RSV was the only virus associated with bronchiolitis in this study.",
