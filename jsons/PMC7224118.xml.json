Results show strong correlation between environmental indices and disease transmission rates when data was analysed from the outbreak in China of 2002/03. This particular study was carried out across 31 provinces and provides a balanced representation of variable climate and terrain parameters with classification based on disease cases in each area. Subtle modification of algorithms developed for multi-variate classification and labelling purposes can provide much improved results and a more successful approach to classification pertaining to disease infection [23]. Research has shown that some of the most successful machine learning techniques used in disease prediction modelling involve using suitable ensemble learning methods. This is due to the accumulation in relevant studies of improvement on classification accuracy performance over single classifier solutions [24].",

A key focus of this research in particular is to synthesize and assimilate available work in this area with assessment of field research sample data used for experiment purposes. Evidence of related disease prevention work and current state of art suggests that customising traditional algorithms is the most promising approach to deal with the issue being addressed. Classification results vary as expected depending on parameters, sample size and nature of disease with Arbovirus classification reaching 90% accuracy during experiments [26]. If this research can be further developed by applying proposed approaches to a variety of epidemic disease prediction problems; then it may be validated as being applicable to multiple environment-based diseases and prove a useful resource for pre-emptive preparation for combating infection of these diseases globally.",

In this collaborative research study, satellite images are used by research partners for image recognition and feature extraction using RGB-scaled image recognition which are then processed with environment features and corresponding field-survey values provided for comparative analysis.

The well-established classifiers used are NB, SVM, J48 decision tree and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the objective of providing variety in experiment as well as identifying strengths and weaknesses in relation to classification of each set. There were many other possible algorithms to apply for initial research however, those used in this study have proved to perform well, specifically in disease related research There are many epidemiology studies using preprocessing models currently available that have specific application for various disease classification approaches. They have shown to perform well in conjunction with existing traditional algorithms such as neural networks, decision trees, SVM and Bayesian probability [25]. Indeed, it is noticeable that SVM performs well in comparison with traditional algorithms when applied for arbovirus epidemic disease prediction modelling with 90% classification accuracy achieved [26]. This study however, was achieved using 5000 instances for training purposes whereas a much more limited data sample is available for performing machine learning experiments in this work. There are also interesting results using spatial clustering and geographical weighted regression models which take into consideration temperature readings, soil moisture and elevation in relation to SD levels which resulted in 68.93% snail dispersion classification [45].",

This approach has the possibility of combining the optimal performances of a range of different algorithms which then work together to classify the target object. In one particular study, researchers were seeking to identify the contents of a particular web page by fusing textual and visual components together and then using the outputs with application of the NB algorithm to then classify whether or not there was phishing involved on the web page [44]. This approach is worth considering when studying on a multi-variate analysis such as this current study as the use of differing approaches to achieve the same goal through a process of synthesizing identifying aspects in the dataset. For instance, if there were specific methods that could predict disease vector density that could be combined with a method that could accurately predict the future climate or weather conditions in a study area then it would beneficial to fuse the method outputs together to identify potential disease risk in that area.",

In each of the datasets, instances are represented by environmental factors extracted using RS satellite techniques together with field survey samples. The combination of environment image extraction and field-survey samples provide training data for making predictions of future snail density without need for further samples to be collected manually.

To address this issue, environment attributes were aligned to provide a common attribute training sample for comparative analysis across each year as shown in Table 1. Once common attributes were aligned, each training set was normalised using a Softmax function which constricts snail density value range into a vector between 0 and 1. The values were then discretised in order to allocate them with a density category in preparation for classification experiments. During pre-processing of raw data, every consideration has been made to carefully handle the data in order to avoid distortion from the original survey sample.",

While the data set is relatively small in data mining terms, it provides a solid basis on which to form initial opinions and observations as to which features or combination of features have the strongest influence on SD levels. When deducing which feature subsets are most influential to the SD levels, assertions can be made on future SD classification and therefore provide the most actionable and important information to those concerned for preventative measures to be implemented. Each data set listed including the collective set were applied to proposed approaches in this work for comparative analysis and validation of methods. A sample snapshot of raw training data is shown in Table 1; values are rounded to two decimal places for this example, however actual recorded data used in experiments includes up to five decimal places. All aforementioned environment features are relevant to the freshwater snail desired habitat and have shown to be indicators of potential heightened disease risk [27].

The real-world collected data in this research will is used as training seed for labelling future RS generated data which is then used for making predictions. A transductive labelling approach was initially applied [28] with an incremental element added which meant that any new instances capable of being labelled could then be added to the original data pool with the aim of increasing the chance of providing labels in successive increment phases of the labelling process. Proposed LTA and STA are an extension of the incremental transductive process which apply multi-classifier options for labelling. These ensemble approaches were a natural progression when using a multi-classifier solution for labelling as they provide options to determine the required confidence level as well as distinguishing agreement between classifiers before a class label is provided. The ITEA methods are a development of previous work [18] which detailed initial ideas and rationale to introduce the multi-classifier option into the incremental process in order to provide a choice for labelling when using multiple algorithms. The algorithm described in the Pseudocode essentially shows the procedures for LTA and STA proposed approaches which are similar in their structure. The LTA method declares that for unlabelled instances, if the probability confidence threshold is met by any of the classifiers; then that corresponding SD label is provided to the instance. The STA method is similar however, it requires all of the classifiers otherwise no label is provided to the instance. The selection of the most appropriate ensemble approach depends on the stringent requirements of a particular research study.",

These were selected due to the positive results received when applied to the disease prediction problem domain and also due to the variety in each approach which yields greater balance for experiment conditions. The classification is focused on three SD classes of \u2018Low\u2019, \u2018Medium\u2019 and \u2018High\u2019 making it a multi-variate analysis problem that is used to provide indication of disease likelihood rather than binary dense or not for improving disease likelihood analysis. If these algorithms perform well during testing then they can be considered for modifying to increase classification effectiveness with this research. Classifiers used in each of the experiments in these studies to assess the distribution and density of schistosomiasis vector levels. NB is a probabilistic algorithm which aims to classify data instances without bias based on the vector class properties. The NB classifier was found to provide consistent performance across the SED prediction domain however, it struggles to achieve the highest classification accuracy results when compared with other algorithms. SVM classification splits the data using a hyper plane which then deduces the class and instance it should reside in. SVM has shown to provide increased classification accuracy over NB in disease prediction research however NB is relatively more consistent across varied datasets [26]. Modified versions of SVM have been widely used with success in the area of disease predictions in epidemiology studies [29] thus it was deemed suitable and applied it with the previous method. Based on the Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm, J48 creates rules for classification based on the information present in the set [30]. During experiments it was shown to perform well when compared with the other selected algorithms in many instances with higher classification accuracy percentages. MLP is a classification tool which functions as a feed-forward neural network and has shown promising results in data classification [31]. One of the advantages of its application is that it continually processes data in order to distinguish classes. In this study, ten layers are used with five neurons hidden and three output neurons. In addition to aforementioned classifiers, a LibLinear algorithm was applied due to positive performance in similar multiclass problem research [32] and a novel feature ranking approach namely max-relevance-max-distance for comparison with our proposed methods [33].",

This is a common problem when analysing satellite images and is related to the climate conditions at the time of image acquisition [34]. For example, rain or heavy fog will reduce visibility from space rendering poor resolution from which to extract environment information from. This research issue is important to address for these occasions as a partially complete dataset can considerably reduce machine learning effectiveness for classification and making predictions. The necessity for addressing missing data instances is due to the nature of classification for these disease vectors and difficulty in attaining primary field survey data. Larger training sets are desirable for use in prediction modelling due to increased training and classification potential so the aim is to retain as much collected sample data as possible especially in the case of learning with limited resources. Simply removing instances which are incomplete would likely result in higher SD classification accuracy in many cases however it would also distort the sample data and misrepresent the selected study area. This would not be indicative of the state of environment therefore the objective for real-world samples is to interrogate authentic environment data as much as possible to extract the prescient information. Common imputation methods for dealing with this problem tend to use mean attribute values from the original set, however the aim of this work is to provide a more bespoke dataset inclusive solution that outperforms standard methods when replacing actual values:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} { v }_{ i }=\\frac{ { v }_{ i-2 } + { v }_{ i-1 } +{ v }_{ i+1 } + { v }_{ i+2 } + {\\hat{v}} }{ 5 } \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}vi=vi-2+vi-1+vi+1+vi+2+v^5Data imputation experiments were conducted empirically by manually removing a random number of instance attributes from each year then replacing them using a combination of methods which consisted of applying:WEKA missing value replacement filter (Version 3.7).The previously proposed MDPV.A novel RCC which uses correlation across the existing data then regression to replace the missing values.Iterative Robust model-based Imputation (IRMI) which uses sequential and iterative approaches for imputing missing data from a variety of data types.The RCC method was proposed to incorporate some of the CTA framework into a unified tool for data imputation in partially complete data.

These methods have shown to be successful in providing accurate class labels to a variety of different machine learning problems. Limited availability of real-world training samples is a common problem in this research discipline and one that is being continually addressed to find a satisfactory solution [35]. Of course, the learning approach that applied is dependable upon the research problem being addressing. Based on the requirement to make predictions using limited training samples as seed for future classification, this indicates using a combination of labelled and unlabelled data with this research which is deemed most suited to semi-supervised machine learning [36]. It is the assertion of this research that semi-supervised approaches are most suitable to apply to this problem domain due to their ability to provide sufficient solutions when considering classification problems with limited training samples [37]. A key contribution of this work is to make predictions on future epidemic disease likelihood based on the environment factors present in a particular area. Taking into consideration acquired field-survey samples over a number of years for making future unlabelled predictions, semi-supervised learning is the most appropriate paradigm to pursue. In addition to this, current research using semi-supervised learning and classification is progressing and providing consistently promising results. Introducing an incremental training element to a semi-supervised labelling process provides a more proactive approach in terms of the machine learning applied for accurate SD classification. This active learning process has the capacity to inform and update the machine process while simultaneously providing class labels [38]. The rationale is to maximize the machine learning capacity before labelling SD instances and has proved to be viable and effective strategy for semi-supervised research application [39].",

Experiments were conducted using well-established algorithms in the bioinformatics research domain including NB, SVM, J48 and multilayer perceptron with application of WEKA machine learning software. Classifiers were combined using the default stacking meta-learner implemented in WEKA and compared with proposed liberal (LTA) and strict (STA) training approaches. As part of the incremental transductive models proposed, a set of constraints must be selected as well the confidence threshold to which any label can be assigned by the classifiers. Then the passive iteration threshold must be set that stops the labelling process when the active learning process can no longer provide new labels for SD classes.

Incremental transductive SVM (ITSVM) was previously proposed as a semi-supervised method for labelling SD classes and applies the SVM classifier incrementally with newly labelled instances being added to the original sample for increasing training potential. Benchmark results in these initial studies comparing ITSVM with standard SVM application resulted in SD labelling improvement on 21% of test cases [17].

            "text": "In addition to ITSVM application, the labelling process was further developed by applying a multi-classifier labelling approach. The basis for this is that ensemble classifier solutions have shown to provide increased classification performance accuracy than standalone algorithms [24]. This being the case, novel ITEA approaches were developed to provide SD class labels using a combination of multi-classifier learning methods. As part of the ITEA, two implementations are derived which are LTA and STA training approaches. These approaches are designed to provide bespoke labelling processes using multi-classifiers solutions for the providence of SD class labelling when required to a specified confidence level. The rationale for these ITEA methods was to provide a classification process with the caveat of label confidence selection and stringency of corroboration between chosen classifiers. Applying these methods for problems in a case specific and selective manner may provide the most appropriate approach for that particular sparse data paradigm. Vector labelling methods in this research are not limited to schistosomiasis disease alone but can be applied for alternative environment-based disease prediction models that use machine learning solutions. The first ITEA sub-method is a LTA which has a labelling requirement of any single selected classifier from those chosen which is capable of assigning a class label to the selected confidence level. Using the LTA method requires selecting a number of classifiers to build an SD labelling model with the basic constraint of a one classifier assignment strategy. Prior to running the labelling process, a pre-defined confidence level is decided then during the incremental process the liberal aspect of the method requires a single classifier to meet the desired confidence level in order for a class label to be assigned. The STA is similar process to the LTA with the confidence selection and classifiers pre-defined but the point at which it differs concerns label assigning constraints. With the STA, all classifiers selected must meet the required confidence levels and assign a label to the selected class in agreement otherwise the instance remains unlabelled.",

SMOTE is a method traditionally used for over-sampling and data imbalance issues. The purpose of SMOTE application with this research is to address the issue of sparsity of data for training purposes. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of increasing instances of data on classification performance in contrast to real-world limited samples. As part of this research, SD class numbers were equalised in order to avoid skewing results due to the fact that there is varied distribution in the target study area which potentially provides imbalance and over-fitting. The SMOTE Equilibrium technique was implemented by pre-processing raw field survey data then equalising the number of SD classes from each year.

Ultimately, if applying SMOTE can greatly improve classification performance over original data performance, then the process can be optimised to provide a bespoke model for use with this research issue. The rationale behind proposing SMOTE is based on the fact that although there is the now the technological potential to access to vast sources of satellite imagery to extract environment information for classification, this may not be sufficient to achieve the greatest performance. It is important to also consider the fact that sparse training samples may not be representative of the greater population of data. Testing was conducted on each year of training data and the SMOTE method was modified to achieve an equilibrium of SD classes and provide balance in the sample to eliminate the likelihood of over-fitting. This recurring issue with many labelling problems and classification research disciplines may skew results if not addressed [42]. SMOTE has been applied with many studies in bioinformatics to address imbalanced data issues. This suggests that the imbalanced data problem is a recurring issue in various disciplines of machine learning for classification that this research hopes to address by avoiding imbalanced data with skewed results [43]. Using over-sampling as opposed to under-sampling techniques, the aim is to increase training potential of a sparse dataset by generating a larger pool of data based on the original limited set.",

The purpose of this is to analyse whether an increase in simulated instance numbers of synthetic data in addition to the equilibrium caveat, can improve balance and performance over original data classification results. To implement the SMOTE Equilibrium approach, the data was processed to equalise the balance of instances in each set, then SMOTE was applied to increase original instance numbers for each year in multiples of 100 ranging from 100 to 1000 instances. Results of these experiments will highlight the possibility of achieving significant increase in accuracy performance for SD prediction with an increase in data instances or whether the difference between a sparse sample will be rendered negligible. The interest of this research is to discover how classification accuracy performance changes with an increased synthetic data pool as opposed to a limited real-world set. If it is the case that a snapshot of data can provide competitive results when compared with a much larger pool of data, then research can be focused on utilising sparse training data rather than spending time on sourcing field survey experts. This will reduce the requirements and cost of specialist equipment needed for collection of training material, saving acquisition time and resources. Initially experiments were conducted using the entire collection of the training sample inclusive of every year as a training set to test on each year in order to assess how well a varied dataset of original could perform in terms of accuracy.\n",

Results show a significant increase in value replacement precision using RCC as opposed to other methods as shown in Fig. 4b with more precise values provided on 70% of test cases over other tested methods. This provides the ability to improve the training scope of partially complete sample data when faced with future incomplete satellite imagery. IRMI provided interesting results which can be analysed further with more test data.When comparing ITSVM with standard SVM application, this research shows that the ITSVM method experiments resulted in greater or equal classification accuracy over standard SVM application in 21% of cases. This is a positive finding which suggests the potential benefits of using incremental, semi-supervised learning for classification in this domain.In terms of the ITEA and LTA/STA paradigms, results show that when compared with the standard default Stacking ensemble; LTA outperforms Stacking in each of the including provision of all class labels for 2003, 05 and 09 when using the same four algorithms for experimenting on 29.1%. Figure 6 shows that 70% and 80% confidence have a high labelling percentage whereas it declines steeply when increasing to the 90% level. STA performed inferiorly to the Stacking ensemble in each of the test cases on average of 40.1% of test cases and was incapable of labelling a single instance from the field survey data in 2007 which signifies the extent of classification difficulties in that year. Correlation of labelling percentage decline was evident with both three and five-point category STA results as shown in Fig. 6b labelling performance was especially poor in years 2007 and 2008.Each of the SMOTE equilibrium Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 show that with every increase of 100 instances on average there is a steady improvement in classification accuracy percentage with some individual exceptions. Algorithm classification accuracy % and f-measure results are presented in these tables with lowest and highest instance results highlighted to identify range of performance improvement. It is also evident that the SVM classifier performed poorly compared with NB and J48. In accordance with this, the MLP algorithm was applied when testing the SMOTE Equilibrium on the 1000-10,000 instance range in order to diversify the methods further and provide performance analysis. Using synthetic data simulation for each year with instance numbers ranging from 1000-10,000 as shown in Fig. 7 shows a trend in increased performance with all but the NB classifier which remained at consistent accuracy levels throughout each year. Analysis of SMOTE Equilibrium methods show many classification accuracy increases when experimenting from 100 to 1000 instances with an average collective increase of 21.26%. With each increase further from 1000 to 10,000 instances over each year, results indicate a slower collective average accuracy rise of 4.82%.",

ITEA are proposed to improve the snail density labelling potential when dealing with limited training data. This approach was initially applied with the traditional SVM algorithm and then developed further with STA and LTA caveats for suitability and application dependant on the confidence levels required in label providence. SMOTE Equilibrium is introduced as a procedure to provide findings and analysis of classification performance when applying over-sampling techniques to sparse training samples. The data was preprocessed prior to the over-sampling process then comparatively analysed with the original set classification to discover the snail density improvements made with a larger data sample.",

The training process does not handle the environment anomalies well when classifying so in these cases it may be better to deal with the original smaller dataset for training purposes.",

Using the two variants of this approach can help utilise the labelling process to suit the research aims. As the results show, LTA provides a high number of labels in the 85% confidence threshold especially in the three-point category graph. The STA as expected labels significantly less instances and shows a steep decline in 2007 and 08 with a small recovery of stability in 2009. These ITEA methods and their results are research problem dependant and can be taken on a problem by problem basis for successfulness of outcome.",

The difference in accuracy has been detailed through each instance increase from hundreds to thousands to highlight the improvement if any when adding additional instances for training and classification purposes. Results have shown that by using the SMOTE Equilibrium method can significantly increase the sparse data training potential for making future predictions. Additionally, this method prevents over-fitting and enables us to enhance the data synthetically while at the same time keeping the integrity of the real-world sample. These results show that there is a beneficial aspect to the synthetic increase of instances for classification purposes. These results can be further investigated to distinguish the most favourable trade-off between synthetic simulation and real-world data for highly accurate classification for making predictions.",

Looking ahead to the next stage for continuation of this research, consideration will be given to the average temperature of the research areas in these sample years to discover the ratio or relationship of SD values to the increase or decrease in general environment characteristics. Spatio-temporal conditions can then be assessed and proposed methods applied and compared with standard algorithms for classification performance.",
