In the United Kingdom (UK), children aged under 15 years comprise 37% of all influenza-attributable hospital admissions (Cromer et al., 2014). The estimated hospital admission rate for influenza in previously healthy children aged under five years reaches 1.9 per 1,000 annually in England and is more than five times greater in children aged 5 to 14 who have comorbidities (Cromer et al., 2014). Influenza-like-illness (ILI) places a significant burden on healthcare systems (Rudan et al., 2005). In the United States, over 600,000 life years are lost, at a cost of $87.1 billion every influenza season (Molinari et al., 2007).",

While enzyme immunoassay based point-of-care tests (POCTs) for influenza and RSV have been available for several years, a health technology appraisal found little benefit of using these devices in a near-patient setting (Nicholson et al., 2014). Moreover, these tests have lower sensitivities compared to PCR-based devices (Boku et al., 2013, DiMaio et al., 2012, Goldenberg and Edgeworth, 2015). A new multiplex PCR-based POCT, Enigma\u00ae MiniLab\u2122 FluAB-RSV PCR assay (Enigma Diagnostics Ltd, Salisbury, UK), became available in 2015. The performance characteristics of a commonly used laboratory based respiratory pathogen panel (xTAG\u00ae) and the POCT assay are summarized in Table A1 (Appendix 1, Supplementary Data) (Lopes et al., 2012, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, 2011, Perez-Ruiz et al., 2012).",

Inpatient admission data was collected during the main influenza season between November 1 and February 28 of two consecutive years, for patients having a Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (xTAG\u00ae RVPfast2, Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) ordered within 72 hours of admission. Patients admitted during the 2013/14 season when only the RVP was used (period 1) were compared (with data collected retrospectively) to those during the 2014/15 season, in which both the POCT and the RVP were used in parallel (period 2). In period 2, the POCT was available for use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for any patient admitted to Mountain Ward who required a swab taken for respiratory virus diagnostic testing. The final sample size was 274 (period 1) and 300 (period 2) (see Appendix 2 for details, Supplementary Data). Staff were encouraged to act on the POCT result although no formal protocol was introduced. Study outcomes are presented from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS).

This suggests that a POCT could function as a gateway or screening test to prevent the use of additional or more expensive tests, with the benefit of providing a faster result. This could be seen if a POCT is implemented in other settings, as performing fewer expensive tests could be cost-saving for any healthcare provider treating patients during respiratory season.
