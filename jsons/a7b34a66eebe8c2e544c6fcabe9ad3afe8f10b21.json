Due to lack of sufficient native fluorescence, the proteinaceous capsid of HRV2 was labeled with Cy5 for detection by the red laser (l ex 630 nm) implemented in the instrument. On the microdevice, electrophoresis of the labeled virus was possible in a BGE without stabilizing detergents, which is in contrast to conventional CE; moreover, analysis times were drastically shortened to the few 10 s range. Resolution of the sample constituents (virions, a contaminant present in all virus preparations, and excess dye) was improved upon adaptation of the separation conditions, mainly by adjusting the SDS concentration of the BGE. Purity of fractions from size-exclusion chromatography after labeling of virus was assessed, and affinity complex formation of the labeled virus with various recombinant very-low-density lipoprotein receptor derivatives differing in the number of concatenated V3 ligand binding repeats was monitored. Virus analysis on microchip devices is of particular interest for experiments with infectious material because of easy containment and disposal of samples. Thus, the employment of microchip devices in routine analysis of viruses appears to be exceptionally attractive.",

These particles range from several tens of nanometres to some few micrometers in size, and usually cannot be electrophoresed in the presence of stabilizing matrices like gels, due to the small dimensions of the pores of these materials. These biological particles possess a z-potential and move therefore in solution in colloidal or subcolloidal form under the influence of an electric field applied along the separation capillary. As the cross-section area of the separa-tion channels of microchips has the same order of magnitude as those of the capillaries in CE but the path is much shorter, these microdevices allow for much shorter analysis times but also exhibit less consumption of chemicals and solvents (whereas not smaller sample volumes) and have the additional advantage that the whole chip is disposed after the run thus minimizing contamination.",

As the pK a of borate is 9.25, the buffering capacity of this BGE is still sufficiently high (it is about 20% of the maximum capacity). The electropherograms were recorded at different separation voltages. The peak of the dye which was incompletely removed by SEC in this fraction is detected together with two not fully resolved peaks at lower migration time. The smaller peak originates from the virus; the larger one is from a contaminant of unknown nature that we always detected in the virus preparations. Resolution of these two peaks is influenced by the degree of derivatization: the higher the excess of dye the better is the resolution (not shown). This is seemingly due to the increasing anionic mobility of the labeled virus as mentioned above, which leads to a larger difference in migration time in relation to that of the contaminant. In accordance with earlier experiments [9] the virus peak decreases upon heating of the sample because the virus undergoes structural changes resulting in subviral particles whereas the peak from the contaminant remains at its initial position (data not shown).",

We thus tried to improve the poor separation of the virus from the contaminant (which can be seen from Fig. 1 ) by applying SDS at various concentrations. The resulting selectivity coefficients for the two consecutively migrating components are shown in Fig. 2 . This coefficient is expressed as the ratio (the larger mobility always being the numerator) of the total mobilities of the respective separands: the virus, the contaminant and Cy5. It is unit at no separation and .1 if the analytes are being separated. We found that at zero or low SDS concentration the selectivity coefficient is very high for the pair HRV2-Cy5, but it is close to 1 for HRV2 and the contaminant. Increasing the SDS concentration results in a steep descent of the curve for HRV2-Cy5 and at SDS concentrations .5 mM the value of the selectivity coefficient approaches 1. In contrast, the curve for the pair HRV2-contaminant increases with the SDS concentration with a sigmoid shape and approaches a plateau with a selectivity coefficient of about 1.2 at more than 5 mM SDS. The two curves subtend at 3.1 mM SDS, which is thus the best compromise for separation. From the electropherograms in this crucial SDS concentration range (we show those between 2.0 and 5.0 mM SDS in Fig. 3 ) it can be seen that indeed at 2.8 mM SDS, the virus and the contaminant almost comigrate, and at 5 mM the pair HRV2 and Cy5 migrates in a single peak. However, at 3.1 mM HRV2 is baseline-separated from both other constituents; this SDS concentration in the BGE was thus used for all further analyses.",

A typical series of electropherograms obtained upon reaction of the virus with MBP-V(363) at various molar ratios is shown in Fig. 6 . We have chosen SEC fraction number 9 (nearly no free Cy5 was present) in order to avoid comigration of free Cy5 and the resulting virusreceptor complex. The initially narrow virus peak shifts to longer migration times (i.e. to higher effective mobilities counter that of the EOF) upon complexation with the receptor fragment, and broadens due to the formation of multiple complexes. This result is reminiscent of previous investigations of complex formation between MBP-V(563) and HRV2 using conventional CE [19, 22, 31] . It shows that complexes of labeled HRV2 with MBP-V(363) can be resolved by this type of electrophoresis. However, these are most probably less well-defined because of lower avidity and the possibility of binding via three and two modules to the five symmetry-related binding sites [33] .",

The results are depicted in Fig. 7 , where the total mobility of the complexes was related to that of the noncomplexing contaminant that was taken as the internal standard. In all cases, the mobility increased with increasing receptor concentration, and the curve reached a plateau at the highest molar excess of receptor.

This indicates that the binding sites on the virus surface might be differently modified by the derivatization and/or that the specific binding activity of the ligands might vary because of incorrect folding of single receptors modules. Therefore, at this time, we did not attempt to derive quantitative data such as binding constants from these data. Nevertheless, the increase in the fraction of complexes formed with the number of concatenated modules reflects very well the data obtained via surface plasmon resonance and via FL correlation spectroscopy [26, 33] .",

However, this is in agreement with our previous findings by using other dyes, and with the fact that the infectivity of the virus still remains upon labeling. The modification of the virus surface by the dye certainly affects receptor attachment, as can be concluded from the excess of receptor needed to give a noticeable complexation which is orders of magnitude larger as compared to experiments using native virus [31] . To avoid such restrictions, we intend to label the genomic RNA, on the one hand, and to label the receptor at the single N-terminal free amino group that arises upon enzymatic removal of the MBP. In this way, the interaction sites of the reactants remain intact allowing for the unperturbed determination of the physicochemical parameters of the virus-receptor interaction. This is one of the topics of our current investigations.",

This dye has an excitation wavelength (l ex is 649 nm) that is well-suited for the red laser of the employed commercial instrument, the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Compared to conventional CE in fused-silica capillaries, the analysis time with the microdevice was at least by one order of magnitude lower than with conventional CE. Separation from a contaminant, which also becomes labeled upon reaction of the virus sample with reactive Cy5, and from the excess free dye was improved by addition of SDS and varying its concentration in the BGE. Chip electrophoresis with the finally selected BGE (100 mM borate buffer, pH 8.3, containing 3.1 mM SDS), enabled an extremely rapid assessment of virus purity, and the investigation of bioaffinity reactions of labeled virus with a number of soluble artificial receptor fragments. This is exemplified by the investigation of the interaction between FL-labeled HRV2 and VLDL receptor derivatives with different numbers of ligand binding repeats. However, it is of note that FL labeling modifies the receptor binding sites on the viral capsid. Therefore, the affinity for the receptors of FL-labeled virions differs from that of the native viruses. To overcome this problem we are currently assessing the possibility to detect virus rendered fluorescent via incorporation of dyes into its RNA genome. This will allow for the determination of the binding parameters of the native partners using minute amounts of sample in short times on an electrophoresis microchip device. ",
