Population-based surveillance coupled with comprehensive laboratory diagnostics are also needed to identify the burden of pathogen-specific causes of pneumonia. In many parts of the world, the great human and financial costs associated with such a surveillance system preclude its consideration.",

Despite the availability of new vaccines in some wealthy countries, pneumonia remains the leading infectious killer among children in much of the world, and the approaches to treatment and prevention have changed little since the 1980s. Beginning in 1981, the World Health Organization promoted a simple clinical management approach for children that consisted of counting respiratory rate and checking for chest indrawing before administering antimicrobial therapy.4 A number of important changes have occurred since then, including the development of vaccines to prevent some infectious causes of pneumonia, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and influenza virus, discovery of new pathogens, such as hantavirus, metapneumovirus, and SARS coronavirus, and new treatment approaches, such as short-course ampicillin. These changes in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of pneumonia have not resulted in a new global agenda for controlling pneumonia, perhaps in part because the burden in the most affected parts of the world is so ill-defined. There is a need for better surveillance for vaccine-preventable pneumonia pathogens and improved methods of pathogen detection to guide a reinvigorated global program to prevent and control pneumonia.",

There is one provincial hospital, six community hospitals, and one military hospital. Since 1975, pneumonia surveillance has been a core function of the Thai Ministry of Public Health and as such has been determined not to require review by ethical committees or institutional review boards. In September 2002, the pneumonia surveillance system in Sa Kaeo was modified to include active case ascertainment at all eight hospitals in the province. There are no private or other acute care hospitals in the province, and therefore these hospitals capture essentially all of the acute care admissions for the population under surveillance. All hospitals are equipped with at least basic laboratory facilities and staffed by one or more university-trained laboratory technicians. Although routine microscopy, chemistry, hematology, and serologic testing are available, equipment and materials to conduct bacteriological testing is lacking or limited. There is universal health care and patients pay 30 Baht (US$0.75) per visit, but this fee is much less than the cost of a hospital stay.",

Two primary readers interpreted the radiographs and a third served to resolve discrepancies. The radiologists used the WHO standard criteria for the interpretation of chest radiographs for diagnosing pneumonia in children.10 In addition, a pilot study of 100 images was conducted so that all three readers could compare and standardize interpretations.

Census data from the Sa Kaeo (2001) Provincial Health Offices were used to calculate the minimal incidence of pneumonia. To calculate the maximum incidence, rates were adjusted separately for each age category to account for incomplete chest radiography and health-seeking behavior using data from the community survey.11 Specifically, in each age-group we multiplied the frequency of radiographically confirmed pneumonia by the total number of persons with clinical pneumonia and divided the result by the proportion that sought care. This number was then divided by the population to get an upper limit of the incidence. Data on routine service and ancillary costs associated with pneumonia hospitalization were collected in Sa Kaeo as part of another study.13\n",

Additional efforts, such as enhancing diagnostic services to include culture and sensitivity to more appropriately guide treatment, are needed to adequately address the substantial problem of tuberculosis in Thailand. In addition, HIV testing and counseling should be offered to all pneumonia patients, as the prevalence is likely higher than the 4% identified in this study.
