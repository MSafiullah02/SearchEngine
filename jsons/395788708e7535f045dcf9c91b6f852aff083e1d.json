Extended preferences for multi-valued choices are used to evaluate the fact of manipulation. Individual manipulability of agents is considered, when manipulating agent moves its ideal point over the plane. The range of possible manipulating positions of the agents is restricted to some rectangle on the two-dimensional coordinate space, within the feasible area of positions of alternatives and agents. The preferences of agents are assumed to be linear orders, constructed by the proximity of the alternatives to the agents, ordered according to Euclidean distance. The computer calculations, using Monte-Carlo simulations has been performed for 3, 4, and 5 alternatives and for even number of agents from 4 to 20. 100 thousands profiles were generated for each number of alternativesnumber of agents case. The results of the simulations show that there are groups of procedures with relatively low degree of manipulability for all of the considered multiple-choice extensions.",

Agents can shift their ideal position in such a way that provides them better result of collective choice. There are several different methods to do so. First, the agent can only move its position inside the feasible area, in this case, a rectangle. Second, the agent can move throughout the entire space. And third, an agent can reveal any preference, regardless of whether it is acceptable given the current location of the alternatives. In the second version of manipulation, the agent's insincere position, in the case of going beyond the boundaries of the limited space, may not be permissible from the substantive considerations in terms of interpretations of the axes in space. In the third version of manipulation, the presentation of unacceptable preferences can be unambiguously recognized by other participants in the vote as manipulation. Thus, in the evaluations, the first version of manipulation is considered. Tie-breaking situations and degenerated cases are not considered.",

The number of agents for which x better, than y exceeds the number of agents with the opposite preferences (y is better, than x).

The dominant set Q is said to be the minimal if no proper subset is a dominant set. The choice is equal to Q. If there are several of them, then the union is taken. 2. (MUS) Minimal Undominated Set. The set Q is called undominated set if no alternative outside Q dominates any alternative inside Q via majority relation l. The undominated set Q is a minimal one, if no proper subset is an undominated set. The choice is equal to Q. If the set is not unique, then the union of such sets is taken. 3. (MWSS) Minimal Weakly Stable Set. The alternative x belongs to the weakly stable set Q if the following condition holds. If there exists an alternative y 2 AnQ which dominates x via majority relation l, then there exists some alternative z 2 Q, which dominates y, i.e., zl y. A set is called the minimal weakly stable if it does not contain proper weakly stable subsets. The choice consists of the alternatives of the set Q. If the set is not unique, then the union of all such sets is taken. 4. (F) Fishburn's Rule. The binary relation c is defined as follows x c y , D\u00f0x\u00de & D\u00f0y\u00de, where D\u00f0x\u00de is the upper contour set of the alternative x in the majority relation l. The choice contains the undominated alternatives via c. 5. (US1) Uncovered Set I. We construct a binary relation d in the following way xd y , L\u00f0x\u00de ' L\u00f0y\u00de, where L\u00f0x\u00de is the lower contour sets of the alternative x in the majority relation l. The undominated alternatives on d are chosen. 6. (US2) Uncovered Set II. The alternative x B-dominates some alternative y (xBy) if xl y and D\u00f0x\u00deD\u00f0y\u00de, where D\u00f0x\u00de is the upper contour set of x in l. The choice consists of B-undominated alternatives. 7. (R) Richelson's Rule. For the majority relation l upper and lower contour sets (D\u00f0x\u00de and L\u00f0x\u00de) for each alternative x 2 A in the relation l are constructed. Then the binary relation r is defined as follows: xr y , L\u00f0x\u00de L\u00f0y\u00de^D\u00f0x\u00deD\u00f0y\u00de^\u00f0 L\u00f0x\u00de ' L\u00f0y\u00de \u00bd _D\u00f0x\u00de & D\u00f0y\u00de \u00bd \u00de \u00bd The choice consists of the alternatives undominated via r. 8. (C1) Copeland's rule I. For each alternative x the value function u\u00f0x\u00de is constructed as the difference of the cardinalities of lower and upper contour sets of the alternative in majority relation l. The choice consists of the alternatives with maximum value of u. 9. (C2) Copeland's rule II. Function u\u00f0x\u00de is equal to the cardinality of the lower contour set of alternative x in majority relation l. The alternatives with maximum of u are chosen. 10. (C3) Copeland's rule III. Function u\u00f0x\u00de is equal to the cardinality of the upper contour set of the alternative x in majority relation l. The alternatives with minimum of u are chosen. 11. (kSS) k-stable set.",
