AdNull was used as a control vector with identical backbone but no transgene [27]. The vectors were produced in 293 cells and were purified by double CsCl gradient centrifugation [28].

Several virulence factors have been identified as possible vaccine candidates, but the most promising are the V antigen and the F1 protein [7\u201311, 32\u201334]. Antibodies against V and F1 confer protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates [9\u201311, 14, 15, 33, 35]. Recent studies have shown that a single intramuscular immunization with both recombinant antigens delivered with adjuvants and combined in a molar ratio of 2:1 (F1:V antigen) protected mice against an aerosol challenge with Y. pestis [10, 11, 36\u201339]. Although this protection was correlated with high IgG levels [40], it has been suggested that nonhumoral immune responses also participate, because immunized IL-4\u2013deficient mice, which do not mount effective humoral immune responses, have been shown to be protected against plague [41]. Also, immunization with the combined subunits failed to protect signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 4\u2212/\u2212 mice against plague; Stat 4\u2212/\u2212 mice are diminished in their capacity to mount type 1 cytokine responses [42]. It was shown recently that cellular immunity in the absence of antibody can protect against pulmonary Y. pestis infection; transfer of Y. pestis\u2013primed T cells to naive B cell\u2013deficient \u03bcMT mice protected the mice against a Y. pestis challenge [43]",

V antigen plays important roles in the virulence of plague. It participates in the regulation and translocation of the effector proteins Yops into host cells through a type III secretion system. Yops virulence factors produce cytoskeletal rearrangements and apoptosis in macrophage-like cells, allowing bacteria to escape phagocytosis and to proliferate extracellularly [12, 13, 45, 46]. In addition, purified V antigen has been shown to suppress the normal inflammatory response in the host by down-regulating the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, which promotes the production of IL-10 by macrophages, and by inhibiting the chemotaxis of neutrophils [47\u201350]",

            "text": "The basis for the protection conferred by the recombinant V antigen vaccine is not well known. The correlation with high IgG titers and protection of immunodeficient SCID/Beige mice against pneumonic plague by passive transfer of anti\u2013V antigen\u2013specific immune serum [14, 15, 51] suggests that anti\u2013V antigen antibodies play a significant role. It has been shown that anti\u2013V antigen antibody administered during infections of mice with Y. pestis restore the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 [49], and in vitro assays have shown that anti-V antigen antibodies can partially block the delivery of Yops (and the consequent downstream effects of Yops) in infected macrophage-like cells [52]. Thus, the protection conferred by a V antigen vaccine might be achieved by opsonization through antibody association with surface V antigen on Y. pestis by blocking the delivery of Yops to host cells, by preventing early bacterial growth in macrophages, and/or by neutralizing the immunomodulatory activity of V antigen, allowing the host to mount an inflammatory response",

They are stable, easy to manipulate, can be produced inexpensively at high titer, and can be purified by commonly available methods [53]. Ad vectors are capable of delivering genes to a broad variety of cell types, and relevant to their use as a vaccine is their ability to infect DCs and other APCs in vivo. The Ad vector itself may act as adjuvant by inducing a strong inflammatory response at the injection site and by promoting the differentiation of immature DCs into professional APCs [54\u201356]. Recombinant Ad vectors expressing a wide variety of pathogen-specific genes have been used in vaccination studies in rodents, canines, and nonhuman primates [57\u201372]. Ad vectors induce protective adaptive immune responses against the transgene product very rapidly after a single application [19\u201326]. This feature is particularly useful for postexposure vaccination or to combat infectious agents that cause infrequent but rapidly spreading outbreaks associated with high mortality",

Most importantly, the immune responses evoked by AdsecV were sufficient to protect immunized mice against an intranasal challenge with a fully virulent strain of Y. pestis.
