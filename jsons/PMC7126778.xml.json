The ITRs and flanking DNA contain several sites for the binding of viral proteins and cellular factors, possibly serving as origins of replication for AdV DNA via the strand displacement mechanism [10]. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ITRs of HAdV-B14 CHN are 137 bp (Table 2) and similar to those for the de Wit strain. We observed two nucleotide substitutions in the 5\u2032 ITR, (CHN)T68C(de Wit) and (CHN)C134G(de Wit), and one in the 3\u2032 ITR, (CHN)A34702G(de Wit). Similar substitutions in the 5\u2032 ITR have been reported in HAdV-B14 previously isolated from the United States [6]. The functional impact of these substitutions remains unclear. The extreme end of the HAdV-B14 CHN 5\u2032 ITR contains a 10 nt motif (CATCATCAAT), and has been found to be conserved among other HAdV-B prototype strains. Another 10 nt conserved motif (ATAATATACC) within the 5\u2032 ITR of HAdV is directly involved in the interaction of the terminal protein precursor (pTP) and DNA polymerase during viral DNA replication [11], and this was seen in HAdV-B14 CHN. Several cellular transcription factors, including nuclear factor 1 (NF1), nuclear factor III (NFIII), specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and activating transcription factors (ATFs) are known to enhance virus replication, and are important for efficient growth [12], [13]. The binding motifs for these factors are localized within ITRs of AdVs; to identify the binding motifs for these host transcription factors, we generated multiple ITR sequence alignments using various HAdV-B species (Table 1\n). Binding sites for NF1, NFIII, Sp1 and ATFs were identified at nucleotides 26\u201339 (TGGAATGGTGCCAA), 40\u201350 (ATGTAAATGA), 108\u2013114 (GGGGCGG), and 131\u2013136 (TGAGGT), respectively. The typical ATF motif (TGACGT) was found to be conserved among all representative sequences, however a nucleotide substitution, (CHN)G134C(de Wit), was noticed in the CHN strain when compared with the de Wit reference sequence.",

Two ORFs were identified in the E1B transcription unit of HAdV-B14 CHN, encoding proteins of 180 and 494 amino acids with corresponding molecular weights of 20 and 55 kDa, respectively. The TATA box and poly (A) signal were identified at nucleotides 1575 and 3471, respectively (Table 2). The 20 kDa protein showed high homology to the small t-antigen, an anti-apoptotic protein that blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by inactivating BAK and BAX [22]. The 55 kDa E1B protein showed homology to the large t-antigen, whose function is to inhibit cellular p53-mediated host defense mechanisms. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, and mediates antiviral host cell responses by initiating cell cycle arrest upon infection. The 55 kDa protein directly binds to p53 and represses its function [20], [21]. An E3-ligase complex comprising the large t-antigen, the E4 ORF6 protein, and certain cellular cofactors degrades the p53 protein [33], [34]. A BC-Box binding motif, 177ALRPDKQYKI186, known to be essential for the stability of this complex, was also identified in the 55 kDa protein. A third protein from the E1B transcription unit has sometimes been reported in HAdVs, especially B- and C-types. However, the ORF encoding this protein was not seen in the HAdV-B14 CHN genome.",

The protein encoded by the first ORF was 558 amino acids (66.6 kDa), and designated the penton protein. This is one of the three major capsid proteins in AdVs responsible for facilitating virus internalization via interaction with host integrins. Two conserved motifs [Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and Leu-Asp-Val (LDV)] within the penton protein are responsible for this interaction with integrins. The RGD motif interacts with \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 types of integrins, whereas LDV interacts with \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b14\u03b27 integrins [33]. For HAdV-B14 CHN, RGD and LDV motifs were identified in the penton protein at amino acids 338\u2013340 and 297\u2013299, respectively. The HAdV-B14 CHN penton was 100% identical to other penton proteins in HAdV-B14 strains previously isolated from North America and with two previously reported B14 strains from China (BJ430 and GZ01). We identified two substitutions, (CHN)S328F(de Wit) and (CHN)N362D(de Wit), in the penton protein when compared with HAdV-B14 de Wit. A conserved fiber-interacting domain (ESRLSNLLGIRKK) was also identified at amino acids 262\u2013274. In addition to the penton protein, the L2 region of AdVs encodes three additional proteins (pVII, pV, and pX). These serve as core proteins and facilitate packaging of viral DNA within the capsid, by forming associations with the viral DNA through arginine and lysine-rich regions [34]. The ORF for pVII was identified at nucleotides 15380\u201315958 in HAdV-B14 CHN, and the protein comprised 192 amino acids (21.3 kDa).

For pVII, a single protease cleavage site (21MYGG\u2193A25) was found, while in pX two protease cleavage sites (25MLGR\u2193G29 and 43LRGG\u2193F47) were identified. Similar cleavage sites have also been reported in pVIII and pX proteins of HAdV-B11 and HAdV-C5 [23].",

A common poly (A) signal for these proteins was situated at nucleotide 21779 (Table 2). Protein pVI is associated with the transport of hexon molecules to the nucleus, and participates in the disruption of the endosomal membrane during virus infection; however, mature pVI is a minor capsid protein [35]. The HAdV-B14 CHN pVI protein comprises 246 amino acids (26.6 kDa) and was 100% identical to its homolog in the HAdV-B14 (303600) North American strain. We found 99% identity to the corresponding protein in the HAdV-B14 de Wit strain, because of an amino acid substitution; (CHN)D3N(de Wit). Two nuclear localization signals (KRPRP and KRRR) were identified at amino acids 132\u2013136 and 241\u2013244, respectively. Two endoprotease cleavage motifs (29LNGG\u2193A33 and 232IVGL\u2193G236) were also determined near the N and C termini of HAdV-B14 CHN pVI. The hexon protein is the major structural component of the adenovirus capsid, constituting about 63% of the virion mass. The epitopes located on the hexon protein are targets for neutralizing antibodies in vivo. These epitopes also assist cytotoxic T cells in recognizing the virus and provide the basis for classification of AdVs [36]. The second ORF predicted at nucleotides 18252\u201321089 in the L3 region encodes the hexon protein (945 amino acids, 106.9 kDa; Table 2). The HAdV-B14 CHN hexon protein was 100% identical to that in the HAdV-B14 (303600) North American isolate, and 99% identical to that in the de Wit strain. We identified a single amino acid substitution, (CHN)I497M(de Wit), in the HAdV-B14 CHN hexon protein when compared with the HAdV-B14 CHN de Wit hexon. The third protein encoded in the L3 region is the 23.9 kDa (209 amino acids) viral protease. The function of this protein is to cleave other viral proteins, thereby allowing for viral assembly and maturation [37].",

A common poly (A) signal for L4 proteins was predicted at nucleotide 27333 (Table 2). The 100 kDa protein is a nonstructural protein; it is required for translation of late viral mRNAs, and acts to inhibit translation of cellular mRNAs. This protein also serves as a scaffold for hexon attachment, thereby facilitating its folding into a trimer, and transport to the nucleus [38], [39]. The predicted 100 kDa protein for HAdV-B14 CHN comprised 812 amino acids, which actually corresponds to a molecular weight of 91 kDa. This protein is 100 and 99% identical to its homologs in the HAdV-B14 (303600) North American and de Wit strains, respectively. An amino acid substitution, (CHN)G343D(de Wit), was identified in the de Wit strain. The 22 kDa protein, in conjunction with IVa2, is now known to play a critical role in the recognition of the packaging domain of the AdV genome, and leads to viral DNA encapsidation [40]. A homolog of this protein was identified in the HAdV-B14 CHN L4 region, and comprised 191 amino acids (21.7 kDa). Similar to the L4 100 kDa protein, this protein was also 100% identical to that in the HAdV-B14 (303600) North American strain, and 99% identical to that in the de Wit strain. When compared with the HAdV-B14 de Wit strain, we found a substitution, (CHN)V173I(de Wit). The L4 33 kDa protein plays an indispensable role in virion assembly [41]. The homolog of the 33 kDa protein in HAdV-B14 CHN was 226 amino acids (25.4 kDa) and 100% identical to the L4 33 kDa protein in the de Wit strain. The fourth ORF in the HAdV-B14 CHN L4 region encodes pVIII (227 amino acids, 25 kDa; Table 2), which is a minor capsid protein, found on the interior of the capsid with three other hexon-associated proteins (pIIIa, pVI and protein IX) [42].",

Structurally, the fiber protein can be divided into three parts: the N-terminal tail; a central shaft with repeated motifs; and a C-terminal globular knob. A hydrophobic motif (10FNPVYPYE17) was identified at the N-terminal end of the HAdV-B14 CHN fiber protein.

This outbreak symptoms also differed from HAdV-B14-associated outbreaks reported in the United States. Sequences from Huang's study were not publically released in GenBank; however, according to their published report, they performed sequencing of fiber, hexon and E1A genes. Their results showed 99% identity to the fiber, hexon and E1A genes of HAdV-B14 strains reported for other Chinese isolates, and with the United States isolate associated with infections at military camps. Taken together, all these findings suggest that HAdV-B14 might have been circulating in China since, or even before, 2010. In summary, considering the prevalence of HAdV-B14 in China, close surveillance of circulating HAdVs in China is required to prevent future outbreaks, and respond to them once they occur.",

The PCRs were conducted in 50-\u03bcL volumes, and included 1 \u03bcL of high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Transgene, Beijing, China). Thermal cycling conditions involved an initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, then a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min after the 35th cycle. All reactions were conducted on a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. DNA fragments were extracted from gels and purified with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Purified DNA was directly sequenced on an ABI3730XL Sequencer using BigDye Terminator version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled using Vector NTI Advance 10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).",
