However, the pervasion of machines in everyday life requires that the non-humans are increasingly closer in their abilities to the ordinary thought, action and behaviour of the humans. This view merges the idea of the Humaniter, a longstanding myth in the history of technology: an artificial creature that thinks, acts and feels like a human to the point that one cannot make the difference between the two. In the wake of the opposition of Strong AI and Weak AI, this challenge can be expressed in terms of a shift from the performance of intelligence (reason, reasoning, cognition, judgment) to that of sentience (experience, sensation, emotion, consciousness). In other words, the challenge of technology if this possible shift is taken seriously is to move from the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to that of Artificial Sentience (AS). But for the Humaniter not to be regarded as a mere myth, any intelligent or sentient machine must pass through a Test of Humanity that refers to or that differs from the Turing Test. One can suggest several options for this kind of test and also point out some conditions and limits to the very idea of the Humaniter as an artificial human.",

More precisely, these are abilities that can be broadly described as empirical and aesthetical (from the Greek emperia, experience, and aisthesis, sensation). These multiple aptitudes of experience, namely, sensation, perception, emotion and sentiment, to which consciousness can be added, turn attention to the sentience. In this other dimension, perhaps even more complex, of human life lies the origin of a research program which supplements that of artificial intelligence. One could name it, with all the precautions of use, the Artificial Sentience (AS), that is to say the exploration and the transfer of the functions and abilities of human experience and senses to a machine. However, it would be legitimate to ask, critically, if it goes for artificial sentience as for artificial intelligence, so that one could state as well that \"Artificial sentience doesn't exist\" [3] 1 .",

The difficulty of a shift from AI to AS comes from the fact that all human functions and abilities, from the most intellectual to the most sensory, can be transferred to machines. The idea of a total substitution, which concerns both the mind and the body, corresponds to an ancient myth of technology, of the art of production of artefacts and possibly, of artificial creatures [5] . I propose to call it the Myth of the Humaniter, that is, the fictitious or imaginary idea of a humanoid artificial creature which allows a total and perfect substitution between human and machine. The Humaniter is an artificial creature which combines and articulates a whole set of human functions and abilities beyond those, more classic, of the Actor or the Producer: the Reasoner, for reasoning and intelligence, the Cogniter, for knowledge and belief, the Voliter, for will and desire, and finally, the Experiencer, for experience, sensation, emotion and possibly consciousness. The Humaniter as an artificial creature that replaces the human is held to be a myth, but this does not prevent many researchers from trying to realise it.",

In other words, I think that the Humaniter is indeed a myth and that, just as there is no artificial intelligence, there is no artificial sentience. The major argument in support of this thesis is that, if an artificial creature such as the Humaniter existed, it would be actually a human being. It would be endowed with the same general physical and psychic constitution, and only its creation would be artificial, that is, non-sexual 2 .

From an operational point of view, it is justified by the need to have machines which, when interacting with humans, behave in a manner that shows their ability to express sensations, emotions and even consciousness. It is a way of making machines more \"human\", especially if they are called upon to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives. From a reflexive point of view, this shift from intelligence to sentience is justified by the need to better understand the abilities of machines to process information, so that they come as close as possible to the humans processing. This makes it possible to measure the possible difference between the ability of the machine and that of the human and to learn therefore about the singularity of the human, which in turn questions the singularity of the machine [6] .",

From this point of view, it takes sides, in the debate between strong AI and weak AI, if one takes up the cleavage proposed by Searle, in favour of a strong program, even if it can be shown that only the weak one can be achieved. Strong AI refers to the Artificial Intelligence program which envisions the intelligent machine as endowed with ability not only of reasoning, but also of consciousness. In comparison, weak AI bounds to an intelligent machine deprived from this full scope of abilities and that can then function as a device intended to better understand human intelligence, the only one provided with consciousness. One could say that the parallel works for artificial sentience, if we consider that strong AS designates the program of Artificial Sentience in which the sentient machine is endowed with an ability of sensation and emotion and to some extent, consciousness. In comparison, weak AS relates to a sentient machine deprived from this full scope of abilities and that can function as a device intended to better understand human sentience and the role of consciousness. Now, one can come back to the two principles, the Principle of Artificial Intelligence and the Principle of Artificial Sentience, in order to clarify their meaning, but also, to show their conditions and limits.",

Because if it was so, then it would mean that the machine is a human who, among other things, is able to say \"I\" -as in the expression \"I think\". In this respect, it is illusory to think that when a machine says \"I, Robot\", it has comparatively the same kind of meaning as in the sentence of a human who says \"I, Human\"\u2026 In addition, it can be noted that the difference between identity (\"exactly\") and similarity (\"approximately\") says nothing about the power of reasoning given to the machine by calculation, if only we compare it to that of the human. Thus, a machine can follow a reasoning which approximates that of the human, whereas it is of a power which is clearly higher than that of the human (as in the chess game with Deep Blue, or the Go game with Alpha Go). Now, it goes without saying that the \"thought\" has a fairly diverse set of meanings, as suggested by Descartes who uses this term to designate reason, doubt and imagination as well as knowledge, will and sentiment [7] 3 . In another interpretation, a philosopher such as Wittgenstein would say that the concept \"to think\" requires to consider the multiple uses that one makes of it in everyday life, the relationship with language and with the behaviour of the body [8] : \"194. We must never forget that 'thinking' is a word of everyday language \u2026 We should not expect him to have a unified use, quite the contrary. 220. 'Thinking' is a largely ramified concept. A concept that contains many manifestations of life. The phenomena of thought are dispersed. 223. The expression on the face of someone who thinks, and that of an idiot. The brow that creases in reflection, in attention.\" This last point raises the whole question of the bodily expression of the mental life, if assumed alike Wittgenstein that it cannot be only \"internal\". It is, so to speak, its \"external\" face that draws attention, or more exactly, the coupling of thought with the words of language as well as the behaviour of the body.",

It is customary in this field to differentiate between the reasoning which proceeds by deduction, by induction and by abduction: in other words, going from the general to the particular (syllogism) or from the particular to the general, with in the abduction a return to the particular. However, this implies that certain rules of reasoning stemming from logic are norms provided with a binding force for an ordinary reasoning which deviates quite often from them. In contrast, a broader approach to thinking includes, in addition to reasoning, a variety of forms of intelligence, with sometimes an emphasis put on creation and invention, that is, the production of novelty. This is how in a psychological version we distinguish a variety of forms of intelligence, grouped under the expression \"multiple intelligence\" [9] : the logical-mathematical form, which corresponds to the rational approach; but also, the linguistic, the spatial, the bodily (implementation in dance or sport), the intra-personal (ability to understand oneself) and the inter-personal (ability to understand others), the musical; to these forms can be added the naturalist (ability to recognize animals, plants) and the existential.",

The nuance as far as the thought is concerned is that experience heard in the sense of phenomenal experience is said in first person, at the risk of fall into Descartes' solipsism. This is suggested by the experiential approach which focuses on phenomenal experience, supposedly distinct from one person to another, since no one can have access to the mental states of others. So, in the subjective approach to experience, I have no guarantee that the object as I see it (for example, a squirrel) is seen in the same way by someone else. However, this is a point disputed by Wittgenstein who notes that, by making my experience too much a strictly private matter, it can no longer be identified with that of the others. Yet even the most personal experiences, such as those of sensation and emotion, suppose a public language and disqualify the idea of a private one used by myself alone in order to express my personal sensation or emotion [8] : \"275. Look at the blue of the sky and say to yourself: \"How blue the sky is!\" If you do it spontaneously -without philosophical intentions -the idea will never occur to you that this impression of colour belongs only to you. And you will have no hesitation in making this exclamation to someone else\u2026 303. Just try to doubt -in a real case -the fear or pain of others!\". What the philosopher suggests is such behaviour of doubt, in a real situation, would be for those who suffer perfectly inappropriate and could arouse their greatest anger. This does not detract from the relativity of perception, in the \"seeing like\" mode, when, in a figure such as the Duck-Rabbit (Jastrow), some see a duck, where others see a rabbit [10] .",

Literally, sentience (from the Latin sentientem, in the nominative sentiens) describes the ability to feel, whereas the gerundive of the verb sentire refers to the concept of consciousness, taken in the sense of being aware of what surrounds us. It is common to express the difference in experience between sensation and perception by taking into account what the judgment adds, however basic it may be. This is about how I see an object, for example, a red cube: I have the sensation of the colour red, but I have the perception of a red body as a unit that occupies a certain volume in space. Sensation is distinguished from perception in the sense that my judgment, even at a primitive level, tells me that this object is not just a flat surface. It would then be necessary to add a concept, in this case the concept of \"cube\", in order to differentiate between a cube and a square, or between a cube and a sphere. Emotion (from the Latin emovere, to set in motion) is another dimension of sentience that is not easy to define, perhaps because it covers actually a multitude of aspects. Emotions do have one thing in common, however: they are the subject's overt responses to meaningful events and can trigger distinctive bodily changes and behaviours [12] .",

Numerous studies have attempted to define what consciousness is and to determine whether it is possible that a machine could be endowed with this ability characteristic of humans or certain nonhumans (animals). As Chalmers puts it, it is customary to differentiate between \"easy problems\" and \"difficult problems\" of consciousness. Easy problems are those which relate to the explanation of cognitive and behavioral functions: for instance, the ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli; the integration of information by a cognitive system; the reportability of mental states; the ability of a system to access its own internal states; the focus of attention; the deliberate control of behavior; the difference between awakeness and sleep. The difficult problems are those relating to the explanation of conscious experience, whether you call it phenomenal or qualitative if what is insisted on is the qualia.",

To see this, note that even when we have explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral functions in the vicinity of experience -perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal reportthere may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience? A simple explanation of the functions leaves this question open\u2026 This is not to say that experience has no function. Perhaps it will turn out to play an important cognitive role. But for any role it might play, there will be more to the explanation of experience than a simple explanation of the function \u2026 The same criticism applies to any purely physical account of consciousness. For any physical process we specify there will be an unanswered question: Why should this process give rise to experience?\".",

Judge J does not know which of his two interlocutors (whom he knows under the names A and B) is the machine M and the human H. In the rules of the game, it is stipulated that, after a series of exchanges, the Judge must guess who between the two of them is respectively the human being and the machine. Correct identification consists for Judge in producing a misidentification rate of 50% identical to what a random answer would give.

A first option, to recognize the machine, is to ask a question such as \"what is the value of 327 at the 4th power?\" If A answers 11433811041 after a second and B refuses to answer, or waits a few minutes to propose a result, there is no doubt that A is the machine and B the human.

Their program is able to lead the calculation of 327 to the 4th power without difficulty in no time, but it will refuse to answer or ask ten minutes before providing a result, or even offer an incorrect answer.

This is meant to show that computer programs are syntactic, they are only tools to manipulate symbols, while human thoughts have a semantic content, a meaning which is attached to words. The meaning of words in language is not reduced to syntax, because it comes from biophysical properties of our neurons that a program cannot possess. Hence this basic idea that programs cannot think: literally speaking, a computer does not speak Chinese, for it does not understand this language as humans can do\u2026 The machines will therefore never be intelligent, even if they pass the Turing Test, because the latter is not a sufficient condition for the intelligence of a machine 5 .",

He imagines the story of a people who would know only one species of bird, the seagull, and would face the problem of making a flying machine. In order to determine if they are successful in this project, these people would use the seagull test in which a machine is flying if it cannot be distinguished from a seagull whose behaviour is observed with help of a radar. The radar limits the precision of the request for imitation as the dialogue, by means of typed exchanges, limits the precision of the request for imitation in the implementation of the Turing test. In this test, planes, helicopters, hot air balloons and even other birds will not pass the seagull test and will therefore not be considered able of fly. Thus, the Turing test is perhaps a sufficient condition of intelligence, but of human intelligence, and it is linked to the language used for dialogues, which prevents it from being considered universal. It may well also be that many of our behaviours are highly dependent on the particular way in which our brain processes information at the deepest level, the one which of the subcognitive processes [18] .",

Attention is focused on the conversation between a judge J, a human H and a machine M, but the main difference in the sentience test is that the content of information and the mode of communication are not the only things that counts. It is also information and communication as it shows a set of aspects of a partner's behaviour that testify the presence of a sentience in the language itself.

This expression of sentience in language supposes not only an information content, but also a mode of communication. Now, if we stick to a classic Turing test, this implies that it can only be a verbal communication, to the exclusion of any non-verbal one which would pass through expressions of the body (gestures, facial expressions, etc.). It is therefore in the realm of the language used by the speaker that the sentience can reside, as when A or B says: \"I have a toothache, it's been a long time since it happened to me. It's a pain that takes me to the bottom molar, on the right side, and goes down into the gums.\" Or when A or B answers, to a question asked about its isolation and its awareness of it: \"Yes, I feel a little lonely in this room, and I must say that, usually, I am rather someone who likes the presence of others.\" If a machine M is able to express itself in this way, a judge J can conclude that it is a human H who communicates this message to him or her. Now, one could also conceive that the sentience test takes into account, according to the access clause to physical information, and consequently, to psychic information, the non-verbal communication. The information and the communication of a machine M should then not only be taken for that of a human H by a judge J, but it should be also by virtue of a certain behaviour of the body. This supposes that, in its dynamic aspect, that of non-verbal communication, if however it is coherently coupled to verbal communication, a machine is identical to a human. It would be so if a machine M, of strictly human aspect, begins to get angry, with the blood rising to the cheeks, the sound of the voice raising, the arms waggling, while saying to children: \"Listen, I have told you several times not to touch this Ming vase. Are you an idiot?\" Now, we are entitled to wonder if verbal and non-verbal communication and the coherent coupling between the two do not requires something like a \"grammar\" of expressions. It is certainly this common grammar that judge J should share with machine M and human H in order to produce a correct interpretation of their behaviour.",

For instance, I am achieving this baptism with a bottle of champagne, but the bottle does not break on the hull, which is interpreted as a failure of the speech act, since the ship is not properly baptised. Behind the intention of a speech act stands the intentionality, the relation of consciousness to an object, which can be extended by considering the background of this relation, the tendency or the disposition of belief and desire [21] . This notion of intentionality can be useful beyond intelligence for the sentience test as a necessary condition in order to give a meaning to an action. Now, one could argue that it is not a sufficient condition, in the sense that, if a machine passed the sentience test, it would not prove that it has intentionality. It would just prove that it behaves in action and communication as if it had an intentionality, but without experiencing sensation or emotion, neither desire and belief. In this respect, no more than syntax, the pragmatics of action would allow access to the meaning of words, if these depend on intentionality and are empty of any intention, desire or belief.",

Thus, the being in question could for example be struck by an object, but not feel any pain, while giving the appearance in his reaction that he did feel pain. The argument is quite close in the spirit to that of the doctrine of physicalism and amounts to saying that consciousness is nothing more than a physical phenomenon. However, some researchers in artificial intelligence, like Minsky, try to show that the argument is circular: the possibility of something physically identical to a human, but deprived of subjective experience, assumes that the physical characters of humans are not what produce experience\u2026 which is contradictory to physicalism. It follows as far as artificial sentience is concerned that the relation between the physical aspects of the bodily behaviour is also narrowly coupled with the psychic activity of a mind endowed with a subjective experience -the \"hard problem\" of consciousness for Chalmers [13] .",
