These structures are protected within the rigid confines of the skull and spinal canal of the vertebral column. The cerebral cortex (the outermost, gray tissue layer of the cerebrum) and the spinal cord are covered by three layers of continuous protective tissue called the meninges. The innermost meningeal layer that directly overlies the cerebral cortex is called the pia mater. The middle and outermost layers are known as the arachnoid and dura mater, respectively. The dura mater forms several intracranial compartments, including sinuses for venous drainage. Parts of the arachnoid\u2014the arachnoid villi\u2014project into these sinuses. The subpial space is continuous with the Virchow-Robin spaces. These two spaces transmit penetrating vessels to and from the brain parenchyma and do not connect with the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space lies between the pia mater and the arachnoid and is continuous in nature; the subdural space lies between the arachnoid and the dura mater. The epidural space lies between the dura and the skull. Certain infections can access the subpial and Virchow-Robin spaces, while most do not. Infections within the epidural spaces are usually caused by direct extension from adjacent infections and the infection remains in close proximity to the inciting source. Subdural infections are often associated with an extracerebral source, but these infections can spread widely within the subdural compartment well away from the inciting source. It is not uncommon to develop serous subdural effusions in bacterial meningitis. Subarachnoid infections are most often caused by hematogenous dissemination of organisms or viruses.",

These specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells constitute the blood\u2013brain barrier, which separates the brain and the meninges from the circulating blood and impedes the influx of microorganisms, toxic agents, and most other compounds, while regulating the flow of essential nutrients and molecules for normal neural function. Thus, pathogens that breach the blood\u2013brain barrier can cause CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the barrier; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specific interactions with the blood\u2013brain barrier that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism (e.g., Escherichia coli, mycobacteria, and spirochaetes).

Bacteremia or viremia can result from infection at sites adjacent or contiguous to the CNS, such as the mastoid, sinuses, or middle ear, or from primary infections at more remote anatomic sites (e.g., lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney). In children the most common predisposing conditions are sinus or middle ear infection, which lead to transient bacteremia and hematogenous seeding of the CNS [1\u20133]. Bacterial infections of the paranasal and otomastoid sinuses often produce phlebothrombosis of adjacent draining cortical (cerebral) veins. This thrombotic process can extend into regional dural sinuses. The phlebothrombosis becomes thrombophlebitis offering a direct route of transmission from the infected sinus to the adjacent extra axial spaces or to the brain along cortical venous drainage pathways. Recognition of the venous involvement is essential, since the venous obstruction can produce intra axial brain swelling which may obscure the extra axial infection source contributing to misleading interpretations on brain and spinal imaging studies. The common relationship between paranasal sinus and otomastoid causes of intracranial infection reinforces the need for the clinician and radiologic imager to be well versed in both head and neck and paraspinous anatomy.",

Fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Since these sites are all contiguous with the upper respiratory tract, CSF leaks occurring at any of these sites may enable respiratory flora to track back up into the subarachnoid space. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures and, further, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) can become colonized and serve as foci of infection. Congenital malformations, such as spina bifida or sinus tracts, can become colonized and serve as sources of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus (HSV), or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis.",

Pyogenic meningitis is associated with a marked, acute inflammatory exudate; non-pyogenic microorganisms (e.g., mycobacteria or spirochetes like Leptospira spp.) are less commonly implicated. Clinically, onset is acute with development of headache, fever, irritability, and stiff neck with or without focal neurological signs over hours to a few days. Although the overall annual incidence of pyogenic bacterial meningitis in the United States is decreasing, the outcome is invariably fatal if left untreated [1, 4].",

The risk of pneumococcal meningitis varies with age but is significantly higher in infants than in young children and adults. Over the age of 70 years, the incidence rises again to approximately double the average incidence for young and middle-aged adults. In adults the major predisposing factors for infection include alcoholism, splenectomy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, other acquired immunodeficiency conditions, diabetes, other underlying chronic conditions (e.g., chronic renal disease), and prior viral respiratory infection. Pneumococcal meningitis is the most common form of recurrent meningitis in patients who have CSF leaks. S. pneumoniae is spread by respiratory transmission in the general population and results in colonization of the nasopharynx with rates commonly in the range of 5\u201310 % of healthy adults. During the wintertime, carriage rates can rise to 20\u201330 % in certain populations depending on age and other factors.

Of these, only H. influenzae type b (Hib) is pathogenic. Although the nonencapsulated form of H. influenzae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract of healthy humans and causes localized infection (e.g., conjunctivitis or otitis media in children) without bacteremia, the more virulent encapsulated Hib serotype causes more invasive disease and is an important cause of meningitis or epiglottitis. Hib meningitis is relatively uncommon during the first 2 months of life probably because of the presence of passively transferred maternal antibodies. But by the fourth month of life, children lose these antibodies and become at risk of Hib meningitis. The occurrence of H. influenzae meningitis is directly associated with the presence and development of type-specific anticapsular antibodies to polyribosylribitol phosphate. Whether vaccine-induced or occurring naturally, presence of these antibodies is directly related to protection from invasive H. influenzae infection [5]. Various clinical studies have shown these antibodies to be opsonic and bactericidal against H. influenzae in vitro and protective in vivo. In the pre-vaccine era, colonization with nontypable strains of H. influenzae led to the development of cross-reacting antibodies that were largely protective against infection caused by type b strains. Before the introduction of the Hib conjugate polysaccharide capsular vaccine in 1986, H. influenzae was the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in children under the age of 5, with as many as 1 in 200 children acquiring invasive H. influenzae infection, including epiglottitis, septicemia, arthritis, and soft tissue infections in addition to meningitis. However, by 1995, the prevalence of meningitis caused by Hib had fallen 55 % [6]. Risk factors for Hib meningitis include malignancy, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, immunoglobulin dyscrasias, HIV infections, and cystic fibrosis.",

Persons with diabetes, a history of alcohol abuse, hepatic cirrhosis, or chronic urinary tract infections are particularly susceptible. E. coli with the K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen accounts for a majority of the cases of gram-negative meningitis in the newborn [7]. Carriage rates of the E. coli K1 serotypes vary in different populations but range from 7 to 38 % in women of childbearing age and may be as high as 50 % in nursing personnel [8\u201310]. In a study of 231 children presenting with bacterial meningitis to the emergency department during the era of widespread heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination, E. coli was implicated in 4 % and other gram-negative bacilli in 3.0 % [11, 12]. Other gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Citrobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. may also cause meningitis in the neonatal period, with an epidemiology similar to that of the E. coli K1 strains. Gram-negative bacillary meningitis still carries a worse prognosis than meningitis with a gram-positive organism [13]. Beyond the neonatal period, the vast majority of cases of gram-negative meningitis occur in the inpatient setting, especially following neurosurgery (e.g., craniotomy) and during placement of devices, such as ventriculostomy tubes, spinal surgery, or in patients who have suffered head trauma [14].",

While the probability of transmission from mothers colonized with S. agalactiae to neonates delivered vaginally is approximately 50 %, only 2 % of colonized neonates go on to develop invasive group B streptococcal disease. Group B streptococci produce polysaccharide capsules that manifest nine antigenic serotypes (types Ia\u2013VIII).

Colonization is facilitated by attachment and adherence of the microorganisms to cell surface receptors on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, enabling them to replicate in the upper airway for prolonged periods. All three pathogens, typically, may colonize the upper airway without producing symptoms. Both host susceptibility and pathogen-specific factors (e.g., virulence and pathogenicity) are critical in the development of invasive disease. Many of these factors, though identified and characterized, are still not fully understood.

After receptor binding, further interaction with the host cell is established by certain outer membrane proteins on N. meningitidis, designated Opa and Opc [18]. Binding of the outer membrane proteins to specific receptors promotes engulfment of the N. meningitidis by the epithelial cells followed by transportation of the bacteria across the cell in membrane-bound vacuoles to the intravascular space; organisms also gain access to the intravascular space by creating separations in the tight junctions of columnar epithelial cells. N. meningitidis also possess other outer membrane proteins that function as IgA proteases, which can specifically degrade the surface IgA antibodies on epithelial cells, further enhancing the probability of invasive disease [19]. Once the mucosal barrier has been breached, the development of meningococcal disease is dependent upon the survival of the organism in the bloodstream.",

The chain of events that ultimately lead to invasion of the subarachnoid space by these pathogens includes a cascade of events involving nasopharyngeal or middle ear colonization, bloodstream dissemination of the respective pathogen, crossing of the blood\u2013brain and blood-CSF barriers, and finally entrance and survival of the implicated pathogen into the subarachnoid space and subsequent infection [28]. Bacteria migrate through the brain microvascular endothelial cells in enclosed vacuoles via a mechanism that is dependent on F-actin. Thus, transport through the cell appears to be dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangement involving both microfilaments and microtubules. Because of the blood\u2013brain barrier, immunoglobulin and complement protein levels and leukocytes are significantly lower in CSF than in serum and interstitial fluid. Thus, in the early phase of infection involving the subarachnoid space, bacterial replication proceeds virtually unchecked by host defense mechanisms. Although the major host response to the invasion of the subarachnoid space by pathogenic microorganisms is a rapid influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, opsonization of bacteria and subsequent phagocytosis by neutrophils are hindered by the relative paucity of complement and immunoglobulins and the intrinsic fluid nature of CSF which is less facilitating to phagocytosis as compared to solid tissues. In addition, leukocyte proteases derived from the initial influx of leukocytes degrade whatever complement components are present in the CSF [29\u201331].",

The mechanism by which LPS and other bacterial cell wall components (e.g., teichoic acid and peptidoglycans from S. pneumoniae) act to stimulate inflammation is probably through the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [29, 32]. In vitro studies with LPS and with IL-1 and TNF show that incubation with endothelial cell monolayers leads to a rapid, transient increase in the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) as well as the selectin molecules such as ELAM-1. As a result, neutrophils are able to bind to CNS vascular endothelial cells at vastly increased rates and then subsequently migrate by diapedesis into the subarachnoid space. At the same time, adherence of neutrophils to the capillary endothelium increases the permeability of the blood vessels enabling more protein leakage into the CSF and subarachnoid space, adding to the inflammatory exudate. Figure 22.2a, b shows the dense inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages seen in a patient with purulent meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae. IL-1 and TNF, in turn, stimulate leukocytes and other categories of inflammatory cells to produce and secrete a host of other proinflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, free radicals, and nitric oxide. The end result is edema of the surrounding tissues, cell injury, and tissue necrosis. Infiltration of the walls of small arteries and cortical veins also leads to a vasculitis with intimal thickening, narrowing and occlusion of small arteries, thrombophlebitis of the cortical veins, and thrombosis of the major venous sinuses, leading to ischemia and infarction of brain tissues.\n\n",

Only 22 % were alert, 51 % were confused or lethargic, and 22 % were responsive only to pain. Within the first 24\u201348 h of onset, 29 % had suffered focal seizures or had exhibited focal neurologic signs [34]. The most common predisposing factors for acute meningitis included pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, alcoholism, diabetes, or immunosuppression associated with conditions, such as malignancy, connective tissue diseases, sickle cell disease, diabetes, organ transplantation, splenectomy, dialysis, or steroids and other immunosuppressive therapy. For patients with some of these underlying conditions, the clinical presentation of meningitis may not be classic because of alteration of the immune response, with the diagnosis only being made upon further investigation of altered sensorium, persistent headache, or new onset seizures or neurological symptoms or signs. The presentation of patients with meningococcal meningitis may be similar to those with pneumococcal meningitis; clinically, one might not be able to distinguish between the two. However, meningococcal meningitis is part of the spectrum of N. meningitidis sepsis and the manifestations of meningococcal septicemia may precede the meningitis by 12\u201324 h. Signs indicative of underlying sepsis may dominate the clinical presentation. The initial presentation in meningococcemia may be completely nonspecific, with the patient simply complaining of feeling unwell but without overt symptoms or signs of meningitis. The clinical condition of these patients may progress to irreversible shock and death before the development or obvious manifestation of meningitis.",

For example, in a review of 54 cases, Gorse and coworkers found that confusion was a predominating symptom in presentation among the elderly compared with the younger age group, and pneumonia was also more likely to be present in the older age group [35]. Typical symptoms and signs are also less commonly reported in the elderly since these patients often have cervical rigidity due to osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, or existing cerebrovascular disease. In addition, there may be hypertonicity of the neck muscles in conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease. Among the elderly, the meningitis itself may progress more rapidly, and patients are more likely to present in coma when compared with younger patient populations. With the development of coma, nuchal rigidity may be markedly less pronounced. Thus, when meningitis is suspected in the elderly, true nuchal rigidity has to be distinguished by careful physical examination. The absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis of meningitis in the elderly patient.",

In neonates and infants, meningitis may present simply as fever or irritability; generally, there is a tendency for fever to be higher in children as compared to that in adults. The classic physical signs of meningeal inflammation or irritation described in medical textbooks are the Brudzinski\u2019s and Kernig\u2019s signs [36, 37]. Although Brudzinski originally described several signs of inflammation of the meninges, the best known of these is the so-called \u201cnape of the neck\u201d sign\u2014the classic Brudzinski\u2019s sign. This sign is elicited by flexing the neck forward. The stretching of the meninges induced by this movement results in involuntary flexion of the hips and knees. Kernig\u2019s sign is elicited with the patient in the supine position and the thigh flexed on the abdomen with the knee flexed at a 45\u00b0 angle. Upon passive extension of the leg in the presence of meningeal irritation, the patient resists extension with complaints of lower back and hamstring pain. Kernig\u2019s and Brudzinski\u2019s signs are neither sensitive nor specific indicators of meningitis and are potentially elicited in only about 50 % of children and only 5 % of adults with acute bacterial meningitis.",

Cerebral herniation occurs in about 5 % of patients with acute bacterial meningitis, accounting for about 30 % of the mortality [38]. Of note, the role of a CT scan is primarily to ascertain whether a space-occupying lesion is present; a CT scan cannot rule out the presence of increased ICP. Clinical signs suggestive of impending herniation include deteriorating level of consciousness, brainstem signs (including pupillary changes, decorticate posturing, or irregular respirations), a very recent seizure, absent oculocephalic reflexes, or papilledema. Lumbar puncture should be delayed in such patients, even for those with a normal CT scan, until preventive measures can be implemented to decrease ICP [38\u201342]. Other contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture include septic or hemodynamic shock, cardiorespiratory failure, presence of predisposing conditions for parameningeal abscesses (e.g., sinusitis, chronic ear discharge, or suppurative lung disease), bleeding disorders, and infection or loss of skin (e.g., burns) over the lumbar spine.",

If raised ICP is suspected and no focal lesions are defined by radiographic studies, one might consider intravenous infusion of mannitol (1 g/kg body weight) to reduce cerebral edema followed by a lumbar puncture after an interval of about 20 min. In addition to mannitol infusion, elective intubation and mechanical ventilation of the patient may be considered prior to the lumbar puncture procedure.

In the 1970s counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) was used for direct detection of bacterial polysaccharide antigens; this test is quite insensitive and is no longer in use. Agglutination tests are commercially available for H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, and five serotypes of N. meningitidis. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are no better than that of the gram stain, and they provide no additional diagnostic yield above and beyond the gram stain and the clinical picture and rarely influence the decision to treat empirically [49, 50]. Therefore, they are not currently recommended in the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis upon initial presentation. The underlying problem with these tests is that they are not sensitive and specific enough to establish a diagnosis upon which to initiate appropriate therapy. For example, if a patient is sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, and found to have a low CSF glucose level and raised CSF white blood count, one would still initiate empiric antimicrobial and supportive therapy even if the agglutination tests are negative.",

Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive than previous technologies. However, this technique is expensive and not readily available in most hospital laboratories. Moreover, in clinical practice, physicians are likely to initiate empirical antimicrobial therapy anyway after requesting testing by conventional methods, especially for patients with typical CNS symptoms and signs.

The major value of CT and MRI scans in patients with acute bacterial meningitis is in the investigation of complications, such as cerebral infarction, vasculitis, abscess, or hydrocephalus. Figure 22.5a\u2013d shows the typical neuroradiological appearances of the brain in patients with meningitis caused by L. monocytogenes, N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and M. tuberculosis. In patients with prolonged fever of 10 days duration or longer, up to 25 % may have a subdural effusion (Fig. 22.6). In some cases this may progress to a subdural empyema, which may account for the prolonged fever (Fig. 22.7). Cortical infarction is a common complication of bacterial meningitis and usually results from vasospasm of cerebral vasculature or vasculitis associated with the meningitis itself. The MRI scan is more sensitive than CT imaging in detecting cerebritis and cortical infarction. Cerebritis is an early complication that may occur during the first 4 days (Fig. 22.8). Early necrotic regions filled with polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells and with ill-defined parenchymal swelling characterize cerebritis. In late cerebritis (4\u20138 days), central necrosis increases, there is vascular proliferation and more inflammatory cells, and suppurative foci begin to breakdown and become encapsulated.\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, chloramphenicol, which is highly lipid soluble, will readily penetrate uninflamed meninges. Fortunately, in inflamed meninges therapeutic concentrations of penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin can be achieved for treatment of the vast majority of cases of bacterial meningitis. Because only the free, unbound portion of an antimicrobial agent is capable of crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, the degree of protein binding of the antimicrobial in the patient serum is critical in determining how much of the agent eventually gets through to the CSF.

If the patient is very sick or if gram-positive cocci are seen on CSF microscopy, vancomycin should be added to the therapeutic regimen to cover for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in a dose of 2\u20133 g/day given every 8\u201312 h in adults and at 60 mg/kg for children in four divided doses, until it is known that the penicillin MIC is less than 0.1 mg/mL For patients with a history of idiosyncratic reactions to penicillin or cephalosporins, vancomycin is recommended, although chloramphenicol may be used in adults. For patients with a history of severe penicillin allergy, chloramphenicol at a dose of 4\u20136 g/day in four divided doses for adults should be given in place of the third-generation cephalosporin together with vancomycin. In adults more than 60 years of age, patients with chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression, or other debilitating conditions, the possibility of L. monocytogenes meningitis should be considered. Empirical therapy to cover L. monocytogenes includes addition of maximal doses of ampicillin (12 g daily dosed every 4 h) to the cephalosporin or vancomycin regimen until culture results for blood or CSF become available. For patients with penicillin allergy, the use of chloramphenicol, imipenem, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be considered as an alternative to cover for Listeria until culture results are available. Therapy may need to be broadened depending on the results of the gram stain. In cases where gram-negative diplococci are seen, it is probably prudent to wait until culture results confirm N. meningitidis before narrowing the bacterial coverage to penicillin because of the possibility that the gram stain might have been misinterpreted.

The use of dexamethasone as an adjunct to therapy in acute bacterial meningitis is complex. It has been shown clearly in animal models and in patient studies that dexamethasone reduces the level of inflammation and reduces the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha [56]. However, in an animal model, administration of dexamethasone together with vancomycin reduced the penetration of vancomycin into the CSF by 29 % and lowered the rate of bacterial clearance during the first 6 h in animals who received an intermediate dose of vancomycin. Animals that received a higher dose had therapeutic peaks maintained despite steroid use, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of the steroids, which reduce entry of antibiotics into the CSF, may be overcome to some extent by increasing the dose [57]. In animal studies of experimental pneumococcal meningitis, an antibiotic-induced secondary inflammatory response in the CSF was demonstrated only in animals with high initial CSF bacterial concentrations; these effects were modulated by dexamethasone therapy [58].",

The object in using osmotic agents is to achieve a sustained reduction in intracranial pressure by modifying the modes and rates of administration of the respective osmotic agent [63\u201367].",

Various clinical studies support the use of adjunctive dexamethasone in infants or children with H. influenza type b meningitis to reduce the risk of neurologic and audiologic complications, especially in those with raised ICP or coma. High-dose barbiturates may be helpful when other methods have failed to control increased ICP. Barbiturates decrease the CNS metabolic demand for oxygen thereby decreasing cerebral blood flow which, in turn, causes a fall in ICP. Phenobarbital is given at an initial dose of 5\u201310 mg/kg, at a rate of 1 mg/kg per minute followed by 1\u20133 mg/kg/h [61, 62]. Such therapies require regular ICP measurements and monitoring of cerebral electrical activity with electroencephalography. Phenobarbital is given until the ICP falls to levels 20 mmHg or until approximately 90 % burst suppression on the EEG (i.e., nine out of the ten screens of the EEG are flat) has been achieved. Serum phenobarbital concentrations should be kept within the range of 20\u201340 \u03bcg/mL. Pentobarbital is preferred because of its relatively short half-life (24 h) versus phenobarbital with a relatively longer half-life. Side effects of high-dose barbiturate therapy include cardiac depression with arrhythmias and hypotension, thus mandating invasive hemodynamic monitoring in these patients.",

If not treated, seizures may progress to status epilepticus, which in turn can lead to anoxic damage of the temporal lobe, cerebellum, and thalamus. The principles of therapy are to control seizure activity quickly and definitively. To initiate therapy, short-acting anticonvulsants, such as lorazepam or diazepam, are administered followed by a long-acting agent like phenytoin. Lorazepam is given IV in doses of 1\u20134 mg in adults, and 0.05 mg/kg in children. Phenytoin is given IV at a dose of 18\u201320 mg/kg and at a rate of no more than 50 mg/min. The rate should be decreased if signs of toxicity, such as hypotension or a prolonged QT interval, develop. If phenytoin is not successful in controlling seizure activity, intubation and treatment with IV phenobarbital may be necessary. Patients must be watched and monitored carefully for signs of toxicity, such as hypotension and respiratory depression. Phenobarbital should be given IV at a rate of 100 mg/min until seizure activity stops, up to an initial dose of 20 mg/kg.",

The epidemiologic pattern is one in which certain strains, such as echovirus 30 or echovirus 9, cause disease endemically, while other strains occur in sporadic outbreaks varying from year to year in different regions.

Arboviruses are spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes, which are part of a complex cycle of enzootic transmission between birds, mosquitoes, and small mammals. The epidemiology of these diseases may be affected in part by prevention efforts from the public health authorities. For example, many states maintain surveillance systems that include testing of mosquitoes for the presence of virus, as well as sentinel chicken flocks to determine arbovirus activity. Such efforts lead to early recognition of an outbreak and warnings by public health authorities for the population to take precautions such as insect repellants, wearing long sleeve shirts, and avoiding outdoor activity in the early evening hours when transmission is most likely to occur. In addition, mosquito control activities may contribute to reduction in rates of infection.",

An example of viral tissue tropism being determined by the combination of viral surface proteins and specific tissue receptors is that of the binding of the HIV GP120 to the CD4+ receptor on T4 lymphocytes. Other tissues with HIV tropism include monocytes and derived cells (macrophages), Langerhans cells, glial cells, and dendritic cells, all of which express the CD4+ receptor. Cells that do not express this receptor generally do not become infected with HIV [84]. So important are these surface binding sites for their respective cellular receptors that several viruses such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, and poliovirus have evolved \u201csophisticated\u201d molecular mechanisms to protect these sites from the host immune response.",

These viruses survive stomach acid, replicate in the intestine, and an initial viremia leads to infection of multiple organs within the body. A secondary viremia from these sources can lead to CNS involvement. The prompt production of antibody disrupts this second viremia and prevents invasion of the CNS. In the case of arboviruses, humans typically become infected when an infectious mosquito pierces the host epidermis to take a blood meal, depositing virus principally in the extravascular tissue although direct inoculation into the bloodstream can occur. Local replication is followed by viremia, and brain involvement is probably determined by viral tropism and the rapidity of the host immune response.",

Following invasion, an acute inflammatory reaction occurs with a perivascular distribution within the brain parenchyma and varying degrees of involvement of the meninges, depending on the infecting viral agent. The perivascular inflammatory response is predominately mononuclear although polymorphonuclear leukocytes may be seen. Infection of neural cells results in degenerative changes and phagocytosis by tissue macrophages or microglial cells. Some pathologic features are unique to certain viruses: for example, cerebral atrophy and production of multinucleated giant cells and multiple nodules of infected microglia are seen in the white matter in patients with HIV encephalitis (Fig. 22.10), or the characteristic features of multinucleation, nuclear molding, chromatin margination, ground glass nuclei, and Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies seen in HSV infections (Fig. 22.11), with extensive asymmetrical necrosis in the temporal lobes, in the insulae, and in the cingulate gyri, typically seen in neuroimaging studies (Fig. 22.12a, b) [85]. In the case of rabies, histopathologic evidence of rabies encephalomyelitis (inflammation) in brain tissue and meninges includes mononuclear infiltration, perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytic foci, Babes nodules consisting of glial cells, and the pathognomonic Negri body\u2014an intracytoplasmic inclusion body within which the virus can be identified (Fig. 22.13a, b).\n\n\n\n\n",

In the case of HSV, the distribution involves the medial part of the temporal lobe bilaterally with one temporal lobe generally much more involved than the other. Autopsy studies carried out on patients who died during active HSV encephalitis show the presence of virus in the olfactory bulbs, olfactory tracts, and the tracts of the limbic system which end in the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, cingulate gyrus, and olfactory cortex [86]. Thus, the virus appears to gain access to the CNS from the nasal mucosa to the olfactory bulbs and olfactory tracts, although the mechanism by which the virus does this remains unknown. About two-thirds of cases of HSV encephalitis in adults and older children occur in patients who have antibody to the virus at the time of infection. Many of these patients have a history of cold sores dating back 20\u201330 years. In the other one-third of patients, antibody to HSV is lacking at the time of onset of symptoms indicating that the encephalitis is likely part of the primary infection. Approximately 90\u201395 % of the cases of HSV encephalitis in older children and adults are due to HSV type I, with the remaining 5\u201310 % due to HSV type II. Neonatal herpes appears to be different, in that 90\u201395 % of these cases are due to HSV type II acquired from maternal or other sources at the time of birth.

Rabies replicates initially at the local site of inoculation, and for this reason emergency preventive measures, such as thorough cleansing of the wound and infiltration with human rabies immunoglobulin, can be effective in preventing infection with this viral agent. In the process of local replication, the rabies virus invades the nerve sheaths and is transported via nerve cells to the CNS. The rapidity of the rabies virus in reaching the CNS is a function of the distance of the nerve endings from the CNS. Thus, bites on the lower extremities may take months to produce symptoms in the CNS, whereas bites in the face may reach the CNS within weeks. It is also important to recognize that the initial incident may be forgotten because of the length of time of the onset of CNS symptoms after the initial infecting event or because the inoculation may be unapparent as has been reported for bats [87]. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for rabies is essential when managing patients with encephalitis of unknown cause, especially in patients who exhibit signs of hyperirritability.",

Generally, neither disturbance of mental status nor abnormal neurological signs are characteristic of viral meningitis. The presence of obtundation, disorientation, seizures, or localized neurologic signs should suggest brain parenchymal involvement and a diagnosis of encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Neck stiffness is generally less severe compared with bacterial meningitis. Clinical clues to an enteroviral etiology include presence of a viral exanthem, pleuropericarditis, pleurodynia, painful oropharyngeal ulcers, or peripheral vesicular lesions suggestive of hand, foot, and mouth disease. The CSF in patients with viral meningitis is usually clear with an elevated white cell count; polymorphonuclear leukocytes may predominate within the first 24\u201348 h, although this number rarely exceeds 80 % of total CSF white cells. CSF protein is generally mildly elevated, and the glucose is normal with the occasional exception in about 10\u201320 % of patients with mumps and less often in patients with enterovirus or HSV infection. In viral meningitis, the CSF gram stain will be negative and routine CSF cultures will not yield bacterial growth.

Aseptic meningitis can also be seen as part of the syndrome of primary HIV infection. Certain strains of leptospirosis will typically present with aseptic meningitis; however, most cases present in conjunction with systemic disease and severe involvement of other organs such as lung, liver, and kidney. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) belongs to the family Arenavirus and is found globally [88].

Transmission occurs by inhalation (aerosol and droplet), fomites, or direct contact with excreta or blood from infected rodents. The incubation period is 1\u20132 weeks; symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, chills, myalgia, headache, photophobia, anorexia, pharyngitis, and cough. CNS invasion is seen only in a few patients either after an initial febrile illness. During the neurologic phase, patients acquire aseptic meningitis and peripheral leukocytosis.

Because affected patients often do not have a history of having been bitten by an animal, a history of close contact with potentially infected animals, including bats, should be sought. Infection is almost always from inoculation but occasionally by inhalation. Rabies has been transmitted by corneal and solid organ allografts [96, 97]. The virus is transmitted to the CNS via nerve trunks. Proliferation in nerve cells in the brain and peripheral ganglia leads to an invariably fatal meningoencephalitis. The incubation period varies anywhere from 2 weeks more than year. Proximal bites with a relatively large inoculum of virus tend to be associated with shorter incubation periods. The onset is rapid with fever, anxiety, insomnia, headache, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, and cough. The patient may complain of symptoms suggestive of paresthesia or fasciculation at the site of the original animal bite due to viral replication at the site of inoculation or in the dorsal ganglia of the sensory nerve supplying that area. The disease quickly progresses to an encephalitic phase consisting of agitation, excitation, and excessive motor activity. Patients may experience hallucinations, become combative, and develop muscle spasms with opisthotonus and involvement of the respiratory muscles. Painful spasms of the throat muscles, precipitated by attempts to swallow, may follow\u2014this explains why patients tend to avoid drinking or swallowing. Spasms may be precipitated by mere air blowing onto the face; seizures are frequent. Periods of hallucinations and aberrant mentation may alternate with lucid periods that get progressively shorter as the disease progresses. Hyperesthesias with excessive reactivity to normal stimulation of light, sound, and touch are very common; autonomic nervous system changes such as dilated pupils, increased salivation, lacrimation, perspiration, and postural hypotension occur. Ultimately, brain stem function is affected with cranial nerve palsies, optic neuritis, and the characteristic hydrophobia due to the painful, violent involuntary contractions of the muscles of respiration and those in the pharynx and the larynx, initiated by attempts to swallow. Eventually the disease progresses to cardiorespiratory depression, coma, and death. Occasionally, rabies may present as an ascending paralysis clinically similar to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome; corneal transplants from two patients presumed to have died from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 actually transmitted clinical rabies, resulting in the death of the recipients [98, 99]. The laboratory diagnosis of rabies requires viral isolation, positive serology (assuming the patient has not been immunized), or demonstration of the characteristic Negri bodies in brain tissue. Laboratory diagnostic evaluation for rabies includes serological testing plus demonstration of viral antigen by IFA in infected tissue, including corneal scrapings, skin biopsies or brain biopsies, and analysis of CSF or saliva specimens for rabies virus antigen or RNA [100]. Survival of patients with rabies is rare; most of the few who have survived received the rabies vaccine prior to the onset of illness.",

B virus is also commonly referred to as herpes B, monkey B virus, herpesvirus simiae, and herpesvirus B. The virus is commonly found among macaque monkeys, including rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, and cynomolgus monkeys (also called crab-eating or long-tailed macaques), any of which can harbor latent B virus infection and appear to be natural hosts for the virus. Monkeys infected with B virus usually have no or only mild symptoms. In addition, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice can be experimentally infected with B virus. The virus is related to human HSV but humans have little native ability to contain it in contrast to its natural host in whom it produces \u201ccold sores.\u201d Human infection usually results from bites or scratches from macaques or mucocutaneous exposure to monkey saliva; laboratory personnel who work with ostensibly healthy monkeys or their tissues are particularly at risk. Indirect contact transmission, such as a needlestick injury with a contaminated needle has been documented. B virus is transmitted to humans from saliva in monkeys and reaches the brain via nerves at the site of the monkey bite. Patients acquire an ascending myelitis and fulminant meningoencephalitis, which leads to death. Infection is diagnosed by a rise in antibody titer or by isolating the virus from the CNS. There are seven different exposures for which postexposure prophylaxis is recommended: if postexposure prophylaxis is administered, it should be started soon (within hours) after the exposure. Neurologic tests should include lumbar puncture and MRI of the brain; electroencephalography (EEG) should also be considered. CSF samples should be sent for culture, PCR detection of viral DNA, and serologic testing. While use of intravenous acyclovir and ganciclovir therapy for patients with the early stages of B virus disease, including patients with early signs of CNS disease has been associated with increased survival for some patients, antiviral therapy has not been effective in patients with advanced encephalomyelitis [101].",

            "text": "Brain abscesses develop as localized areas of cerebritis (i.e., poorly demarcated areas of encephalitis), initially consisting of bacteria in the brain parenchyma together with inflammation and edema. Over the ensuing days this area of cerebritis becomes more localized with the development of necrosis in the middle and a ring-enhancing capsule. Ultimately, host defenses lead to the development of a well-formed fibrous capsule. The most common predisposing conditions for the development of a brain abscess are infections in the middle ear, paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and teeth (dental abscess). It is believed that bacteria reach the brain through valveless emissary veins, which traverse the cranium into the venous drainage system of the brain, or retrograde spread through the venous system. Alternatively, direct extension through an area of osteitis or osteomyelitis adjacent to the sinus or middle ear infection provides access to the CNS; chronic otitis media is a common predisposing factor with the abscesses most frequently forming in the temporal lobe or cerebellum. The other major mechanism by which the brain parenchyma becomes seeded is via metastatic transmission through the cerebral arteries from an extracranial focus of infection. Approximately 20 % of brain abscesses arise from a contiguous focus; 25 % are associated with hematogenous spread from a distant focus, such as a pyogenic lung abscess or bronchiectasis, and 25 % occur following trauma [105\u2013107].",

However, the classic triad of focal neurological signs, fever, and headache is present in less than 50 % of cases; nuchal rigidity is not prominent in patients with brain abscess. Similarly, patients with subdural empyema seem to present with a more localized headache and focal neurologic symptoms and altered level of consciousness. Other common signs and symptoms include fever, chills, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and altered sensorium [119]. Depending on the location of the lesion, fever and stiff neck may be present. Headache of varying degree of severity is the most consistent symptom among patients with brain abscess. The headache is generally not well localized and may be mild and difficult to differentiate from ordinary headaches. Fever is present in 40\u201350 % of cases, and focal neurologic symptoms and signs, such as hemiparesis, aphasia, ataxia, and sensory deficits, may be present in one-third to one-half of cases. Papilledema as a reflection of increased ICP is present in only a minority of cases [112, 119]. Likewise, seizures are observed in approximately 25\u201345 % of patients by the time they present. The seizures are most often generalized and associated with frontal lobe lesions. Other frequent CNS findings include altered mental states\u2014confusion, aberrant behavior, and somnolence. To some extent, the presenting signs and symptoms are dependent on the location of the abscess. For example, cerebellar abscesses often present with nystagmus, ataxia in the ipsilateral extremities, vomiting, and dysmetria [120, 121]. Frontal lobe abscesses generally present with headache, drowsiness, and deterioration of mental status or aphasia together with hemiparesis and unilateral motor signs. Temporal lobe abscesses may present with or without aphasia or dysphasia, depending on whether the abscess is in the dominant hemisphere. Patients with occipital lobe abscesses may present with homonymous hemianopia, while typical features in parietal lobe abscesses include hemianesthesia, homonymous hemianopia, neglect of one-half of the body, alexia, or impaired spatial perception. Pituitary abscesses may simulate a tumor and can present with visual field defects and endocrine abnormalities.

MRI is more sensitive than CT scans and provides information on the size, location, and stage of the abscess together with the extent of surrounding edema and presence or absence of mass effect, such as midline shift, hydrocephalus, and impending herniation. The time line for bacterial brain abscess evolution is reasonably predictable and is divided into early cerebritis, late cerebritis, early abscess, mature abscess, and hopefully resolution (Fig. 22.8). Each of these stages takes place in roughly 4 days, hence the rule of 4 s for intra-axial brain abscess. This evolution of brain abscess is predicated on a normal immune system and does not apply in the immunocompromised host. Success of treatment is measured by progressively diminishing cross-sectional diameter of the abscess cavity. Radiologic changes in the abscess wall (i.e., thickness and contrast enhancement), surrounding edema, or status of internal contents are not reliable predictors of treatment success. Characteristic findings of a brain abscess are a ring-enhancing lesion in the contrast CT or MRI studies with a hypodense center reflecting the necrotic center of the abscess surrounded by a variable zone of edema [124] (Fig. 22.16a, b).\n\n",

MRI and CT are comparable in defining retropharyngeal abscess and chronic fungal sinus and skull base infections. CT is less sensitive than MRI for characterizing the stages of cerebritis and abscess formation and for excluding other causes of intra axial necrotic masses in the brain [125, 126]. MRI especially with diffusion brain imaging sequences maintains a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; see following discussion.

On T2-weighted sequences the central area of necrosis appears hyperintense and is surrounded by a well-defined hypointense capsule and readily discernible surrounding area of low density, representing cerebral edema. Another major advantage of MRI imaging studies is their ability to detect the cerebritis stage before the formation of the abscess with a fully developed capsule. The most helpful MR sequence is the diffusion techniques. This technique, most applicable once central necrosis has occurred, demonstrates the restriction of water movement within the forming fibrous abscess capsule. Other methods, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), can detect products of bacterial metabolism, such as lactate, acetate, or pyruvate, and may improve our ability to differentiate brain abscesses from malignancy [128\u2013130].",

Stereotactic-guided needle aspiration of pus drains the collection and enables procurement of specimens for gram stain, culture, and histology. Open craniotomy may be considered in cases where response to antimicrobial therapy is poor or the organism isolated from culture is antimicrobial-resistant. Antimicrobial therapy alone may be considered for patients with numerous abscesses that are not amenable to surgical drainage or for patients with small abscesses who have stable neurologic function. The choice of antimicrobials is determined both by the spectrum of microbiological agents known to cause brain abscess and the degree to which individual antimicrobials penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier and enter into the abscess cavity itself. For brain abscesses that develop in contiguity with frontal sinus infection, mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora may be assumed to be present. In this situation, even if anaerobic bacteria are not recovered, treatment should be given with high-dose penicillin 10\u201320 million units per day together with metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 h or 15 mg/kg IV every 12 h. If there is any suspicion that the abscess may have arisen from a dental focus, anaerobic cultures should be held for 7\u201314 days to enable detection of Actinomyces spp. growth. However, actinomycosis should respond to standard therapy with penicillin. Brain abscesses that are related to chronic otitis media and mastoiditis should be treated with a combination of antimicrobials that will cover anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas spp. Thus, a combination of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole would work well in this clinical scenario. Although bacterial cultures may not always yield growth of anaerobes, particularly if the organisms are fastidious, the absence of growth of Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas spp. on culturing abscess material from a patient who has not received prior intravenous antimicrobial therapy can be relied upon to rule out these particular organisms as the cause of infection. Similarly, the absence of S. aureus from culture of abscess matter would also be very good evidence that this agent is not involved in the pathogenesis of the abscess. In general, S. aureus is much more likely to be implicated in endocarditis, metastatic infection to the CNS, or in the setting of trauma or postsurgical wound infection. If a brain abscess is associated with a neurosurgical procedure, vancomycin should be included in the empirical therapeutic regimen to cover both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.",

The most common cause of the spontaneous infection in the epidural space is hematogenous spread from distant foci (50 %), such as infections of the skin and oral cavity, pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections, endocarditis, intra-abdominal and pelvic sepsis, and urinary tract infections [136]. Other causes of spontaneous abscess formation include direct extension (i.e., contiguous spread) from preexisting discitis or osteomyelitis in an adjacent vertebral body, extension of a decubitus ulcer or paraspinal abscess, blunt spinal trauma, or penetrating injuries. Secondary causes include postoperative infections (16 % of all spinal epidural abscesses) and infections associated with epidural anesthesia catheters [141\u2013143]. An epidural hematoma resulting from trauma can also become secondarily infected and progress to an epidural abscess [136].",

            "text": "The location of an epidural abscess within the spinal canal is determined largely by the underlying cause of the epidural abscess [104, 136, 140, 141]. The majority of spontaneous spinal epidural abscesses that result from hematogenous spread of bacteria are usually located posteriorly within the spinal canal; epidural abscesses secondary to preexisting vertebral osteomyelitis are usually confined to the anterior spinal canal [140\u2013145]. The segregation and isolation of abscesses to the anterior or posterior spinal canal is thought to be secondary to septations within the epidural fat [140]. These septations not only divide the epidural space into anterior and posterior compartments but also divide the space longitudinally. The longitudinal septations usually limit the extent of epidural abscess formation to up to four vertebral levels [140]. Postsurgical spinal epidural abscesses often involve multiple compartments, extending several levels and circumferentially around the spinal cord, secondary to disruption of the epidural septations [144]. In addition to causing compression of the spinal cord, pus and granulation tissue in the epidural space can cause ischemia of the spinal cord by compromising and reducing arterial blood flow. The neurologic sequelae of epidural abscess formation can be slowly progressive or dramatically acute in nature; in the latter scenario, complete paralysis could occur within a matter of hours [141]. The neurological injury is thought to be secondary to both compression of the neural elements vascular thrombosis and ischemia [140, 141, 146, 147].",

The spectrum of risk factors is fairly consistent between reports of other large case series [136, 137, 140, 144]. Certain comorbid states such as diabetes and alcoholism result in an immunodeficient state that predisposes a patient to the development of a spinal abscess [144, 146].

Discitis and the bacteremia associated with IV drug abuse, directly seed the epidural space with pathogens responsible for the epidural infection [141].",

Leukocytosis is found in roughly 75 % of patients [141, 148]. Results of CSF analysis are variable, ranging from normal to frank pus [144]. Blood cultures have been reported to be positive in up to 60 % of cases [140]. Contrast-enhanced MRI scans give superior resolution of soft tissue, the spinal cord, and epidural space when compared to CT myelography and are the diagnostic procedure of choice in many facilities. An epidural abscess appears as a low-intensity image on T1-weighted MRI scans (Fig. 22.17). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging remains one of the most sensitive, specific, and accurate imaging methods for confirming and defining the presence of a spinal epidural abscess and determining its location [54, 137\u2013139]. If MRI services are not available, myelography should be carried out. Lumbar puncture to determine CSF protein concentrations is not needed for diagnosis and may introduce bacteria into the subarachnoid space with consequent meningitis and, therefore, should not be performed [154].\n\n",

If the patient has neurological signs at presentation, immediate surgical decompression of the spinal cord is absolutely essential. During the time that culture results are not available, and because S. aureus is a commonly implicated pathogen in spinal epidural abscesses, an antistaphylococcal penicillin, a first-generation cephalosporin, or vancomycin should be included in the treatment regimen together with an agent that is active against gram-negative organisms, such as a third-generation cephalosporin. If MRSA is suspected or implicated, vancomycin should be used. If the infection follows a neurosurgical procedure, an antistaphylococcal penicillin, a third-generation cephalosporin, and an aminoglycoside are prescribed in combination. Spinal epidural abscess carries with it a high mortality rate and significant long-term sequelae, including paralysis. The mortality rate is estimated to be 14 %, and 35\u201340 % of patients will have neurological sequelae, such as residual weakness or permanent paralysis [136, 138, 140, 148]. Prognosis depends upon the clinical and neurological condition of the patient at the time of presentation [136, 141, 146, 149]. Patients presenting with sepsis or plegia have higher mortality and long-term morbidity rates [137, 138, 142, 144, 145, 148, 150, 154].",

            "text": "Spontaneous vertebral osteomyelitis usually results from hematogenous spread of organisms through the segmental spinal arteries to the subchondral plate region of the vertebral body adjacent to the disc space [167, 168]. In adults, the nidus of infection begins in the vertebral bodies at the level of the end arteriolar arcades and, after endplate destruction, spreads secondarily into the avascular disc space [156, 168]. In children, the disc space contains vascular channels that allow primary seeding of the intervertebral disc [156, 168, 169]. Segmental spinal arteries typically bifurcate to supply adjacent vertebral segments, this bifurcation is thought to account for the fact that vertebral osteomyelitis typically involves two adjacent vertebrae and the intervening disc space [168]. Postoperative vertebral osteomyelitis usually occurs due to direct inoculation of the microorganism at the time of surgery [156, 157, 161, 164, 167, 169]. The principal sources of wound contamination are surgery personnel or the patient\u2019s own skin flora [167]. Unlike spontaneous vertebral osteomyelitis, the disc space is often the nidus of infection in patients who have undergone a surgical procedure [156, 167, 169]. Other sources or risk factors for vertebral osteomyelitis include inoculation via decubitus ulcers and trauma or IV drug abuse [165, 172\u2013174].",

Radiological imaging is often unable to differentiate between vertebral osteomyelitis caused by mycobacteria and bacteria; thus, initial clinical assessment of a patient with spinal osteomyelitis should include tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis, especially in high-risk patients or in regions or countries with a high prevalence of mycobacterial infections or in countries where tuberculosis and HIV infection are endemic [163, 165, 166]. Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species, and other less common fungi have all been implicated as causes of vertebral osteomyelitis [165, 182]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus are the most commonly implicated pathogens in vertebral osteomyelitis in IV drug abusers and occur at roughly equal rates [175, 183].",

The pain is localized, continuous, and generally unrelated to movement or position [157]. Vertebral osteomyelitis acquired by the hematogenous mode tends to involve the lower dorsal and lumbar spine. Nearly all spine infections are associated with tenderness on palpation over the involved level: vertebral osteomyelitis tends to be localized to the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae in 58 and 30 % of cases, respectively [156, 157, 161, 166]. Involvement of the cervical vertebrae (11 %) has been noted among IV drug abusers and patients with pulmonary tuberculous [156]. Neurologic impairment, such as sensory loss, weakness, or radiculopathy, is reported in one-third of cases. The presence of radiculopathy, positive straight leg raise, and neurological deficit (4\u201316 %) is less reliable and often indicates the presence of epidural involvement [157, 166]. Fever is found in approximately half of patients with pyogenic spinal osteomyelitis, and constitutional symptoms, including malaise, night sweats, and anorexia, have been reported [157, 161, 167, 191].",

For example, the differential diagnosis of back pain in a patient with fever includes various viral syndromes, aortitis, pyelonephritis, and pancreatitis [161]. In the absence of fever, other causes of back pain, such as an osteoporotic fracture, spondylarthritis, degenerative disc disease, or spinal stenosis, might have to be ruled out [161, 168]. In several large patient series, the delay between the onset of symptoms and eventual diagnosis has ranged from 3 weeks to 3 months [157, 162, 168, 192]. These delays in diagnosis can result in significant neurological morbidity [168].

Blood cultures are critical in the workup of a patient with a putative diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis and, if positive (up to 78 % of blood cultures are positive), might obviate the need for an invasive diagnostic procedure to procure a biopsy specimen [157, 165, 178]. Plain X-ray findings include disc space narrowing and vertebral end plate changes that usually become apparent 2\u20134 weeks after symptom onset in approximately 80 % of patients [156, 157, 167, 191]. Technetium 99 m bone scanning combined with gallium scanning has a 90 % sensitivity and specificity for vertebral osteomyelitis [193]. MRI imaging is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for vertebral osteomyelitis and has the added benefit of providing details regarding the presence of an epidural or paraspinal abscess and various other complications [156, 161, 194\u2013196]. Characteristic MRI changes include decreased T1 signal and increased T2 signal of the involved vertebral endplates and disc space [156, 196] (Fig. 22.18). Positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose has a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of MRI and might be considered if the patient has metallic implants [195].\n\n",

If imaging is suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis but blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth, then a biopsy of the infected vertebra is mandatory [156, 157, 167, 191]. The procedure of choice would depend on the presence of underlying intrinsic patient risk factors with input from surgical and interventional radiology personnel regarding CT-guided versus open biopsy [161]. When blood cultures are negative, a CT-guided needle biopsy can be used to make a definitive microbiological diagnosis 60\u201390 % of the time [157]. An open biopsy should be considered when both blood cultures and CT-guided aspirates are negative [167]. A skin test for tuberculosis should be placed in all patients and CT aspirates or biopsy material should be sent for routine fungal stains and cultures [167, 192]. If polymicrobial osteomyelitis is suspected (e.g., a patient with concomitant intra-abdominal sepsis), a biopsy should be performed whether or not blood cultures are positive for bacterial growth [181].",

Prolonged courses of parental antimicrobials directed by specific culture results and antimicrobial susceptibilities are the rule [161, 165, 191]. Although there are no data from controlled trials that suggest the optimal duration of therapy, 4\u20136 weeks of antimicrobial therapy is usually recommended [176, 197, 198]. One large review suggested that 4 weeks therapy with high-dose IV antimicrobials is sufficient to treat pyogenic spinal osteomyelitis as long as the following criteria are met: (1) there are no undrained abscesses, (2) the patient is clinically stable, and (3) the ESR has decreased to one-half its original value [165].",

Tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis requires an average of 12 months treatment with a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, depending on regional susceptibility [156, 199]. Treatment of other less common bacterial and fungal causes of vertebral osteomyelitis should be tailored to the individual pathogen and to regional antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.

A variety of surgical approaches have been described in the literature, each with its own advantages and disadvantages [156, 162, 192].

Conflicting data exist regarding the association between duration of ventricular drainage and the rate of EVD-associated infections [205, 210, 216, 217]. Some clinical series have shown a linear relationship between infection and duration of ventricular drainage [218, 219]. Various authors have advocated the routine changing of ventricular catheters after day 5 in order to lower the risk of infection, while others have suggested that the duration of monitoring is not a risk factor associated with infection. In fact, later studies have shown that a constant daily rate of infection actually decreases after day 10 or 11 of drainage [217, 219].",

Because the results of the CSF leukocyte count may be confounded by intraventricular hemorrhage, Pfausler and colleagues introduced the \u201ccell index\u201d as a new parameter for the diagnosis of EVD-related ventriculomeningitis [221]. They showed that a significant increase of this index is highly indicative of EVD-related ventriculitis in patients with hemorrhagic CSF and that calculation of the \u201ccell index\u201d on a daily basis allows the timely diagnosis and hence initiation of antimicrobial therapy of catheter-related ventriculomeningitis [221]. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (70 %), S. aureus (10 %), and gram-negative bacteria (15 %), including P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and E. coli, remain the most common microorganisms associated with ventriculomeningitis [220\u2013224].",

The benefit of systemic prophylactic antimicrobials for the first 24 h postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient\u2019s age or the type of internal shunt being used, has been demonstrated although the benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain [226\u2013229].",

Antimicrobial impregnated catheters have been manufactured for a variety of applications and have been shown to be effective in preventing EVD-associated infections [225, 230, 231, 235\u2013239, 244, 245]. Beer and colleagues suggest that the management of EVD-related ventriculitis should involve decisions related to catheter exchange, the type and route of administration (intravenous versus intrathecal) of antimicrobial therapy, based on the type of suspected organism and its resistance pattern, and the duration of antimicrobial therapy [220]. Once the diagnosis is made, broad-spectrum antimicrobials should be administered, followed by diagnostic testing, and targeted antibiotic therapy as soon as antimicrobial susceptibility testing results become available.",

The histologic appearance depends on the stage of the disease. Initially it consists of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. But later, after a phase of lymphocytic proliferation, granulomata with caseating centers become a prominent feature (Fig. 22.19). Another feature of tuberculous infection of the meninges is involvement of the blood vessels traversing the meninges: small- and medium-sized arteries are most often involved, although capillaries and veins may be similarly affected. The changes include granuloma formation and inflammation of the adventitia, which causes a reactive cellular proliferation of the intima, which in turn may lead to occlusion of the vessel and infarction of the areas supplied by the vessel. Clinically, this vasculitis is frequently found in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery due to its anatomic location at the base of the brain, where the inflammatory response is most intense. This profound inflammatory response with vasculitis causes compression of neural tissues and compromises cerebral blood flow leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, obstruction of CSF free flow, resulting in hydrocephalus and cerebral edema.\n\n",

The classic findings of elevated protein, depressed CSF glucose relative to serum, and pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance, together with a history of chronic illness over a matter of weeks as opposed to days as in acute bacterial meningitis, is strongly suggestive of a tuberculous or fungal etiology. Median CSF protein levels generally range between 100 and 400 mg/dL but may go as high 2 g/dL, although levels of that magnitude usually suggest mechanical blockage of CSF flow. The median white count generally runs between 100 and 200 WBC/mm3. The CSF glucose is less than 45 mg/dL in 70\u201380 % of patients. The glucose level tends to become progressively lower and the protein progressively higher as the duration of illness progresses without appropriate therapy; when treatment is successful, the glucose level tends to return towards normal. Although any one of these CSF parameters may be completely normal, it is extremely unusual for all three parameters to be completely normal in a patient with true tuberculous meningitis. If CSF analysis is completely normal and the laboratory reports M. tuberculosis, the report should be considered suspect until proven otherwise.

Treatment must be continued for at least 12 months. INH is generally used at a dose of 300 mg/day in adults or 10 mg/kg/day in children. The most serious side effect is hepatitis, which ranges from asymptomatic enzyme elevations to fulminant hepatic necrosis. The true risk of INH side effects is approximately 0.1 % among those receiving INH alone for prophylaxis and greater than 1 % for those receiving INH as part of a treatment regimen for tuberculosis [270]. The incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher in persons over 35 years of age, as well as those with other conditions affecting liver function such as alcoholism and viral hepatitis. The dose of rifampin is 600 mg/day and is only infrequently associated with side effects such as a flu-like syndrome and a hypersensitivity reaction with renal, hepatic, and hematologic toxicity. Pyrazinamide is given in a dose of 25 mg/kg/day and has a relatively low incidence of side effects; there is little added toxicity when combined with INH and rifampin. INH, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide all have good penetration of the CSF. Ethambutol is generally administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg for the first 1\u20132months of treatment with a reduction in dose to approximately 15 mg/kg/day because of the risk of optic neuritis, seen in approximately 25 % of patients. The first clue to the development of this complication is loss of red-green vision or diminished visual acuity; ophthalmologic consultation is suggested in these situations. Streptomycin was one of the first drugs found to be active against tuberculosis and is commonly administered in a dose of 20\u201340 mg/kg/day for children and 1 g/day for adults. Unfortunately, the irreversible ototoxicity is so frequent that it is not advisable to use this agent unless absolutely necessary. Second-line antituberculous drugs such as para-aminosalicylic (PAS), cycloserine, ethionamide, kanamycin, and amikacin should only be used based on treatment failure with primary agents and antimicrobial susceptibility studies. Of these agents, ethionamide and cycloserine penetrate well into the CNS.",

The mortality rate among HIV-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis is significantly higher than the comparable rate for meningitis caused by susceptible strains. In short, the best way to prevent HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis is to diagnose and isolate infectious cases of tuberculosis promptly and administer appropriate treatment promptly in all patients in whom the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is suspected or ascertained [273].",

Perhaps the most significant prognostic factor for survival is the degree to which the disease has advanced at the time of initial presentation. Other factors correlating with poor response to therapy include age and coexistent miliary disease. The earliest sign of response to therapy in most cases is reduction in peak daily temperatures within the first 1\u20132 weeks and subjective improvement in fatigue and malaise over the same period. However, early studies pointed out that it was not uncommon for some markers of disease, such as the presence of bacilli in a smear of the CSF or a rise in CSF protein, to occur shortly after the initiation of treatment. In general, the glucose level in the CSF rises with successful treatment while the protein returns to normal more slowly, a process that may take as long as 6 months.",

The pathogenesis of tuberculomas is similar to that of tuberculous meningitis in that a tuberculous granuloma, seeded during the phase of acquiring the primary infection, breaks down and, because of its location within the brain parenchyma, produces a mass lesion rather than meningitis. Patients may present with fever, headache, focal or generalized seizure, or change in mental status and may manifest signs of proptosis, papilledema, or transient neurologic deficits. Clinical features are related to the anatomic location of the tuberculoma. Generally, patients have a single lesion on presentation. However autopsy series and sophisticated radiologic studies have shown that in up to 70 % of patients, multiple lesions are present. The duration of symptoms prior to presentation is somewhat longer than in tuberculous meningitis, averaging weeks to months with occasional patients having symptoms for years prior to diagnosis. In fact, 30 % of patients with tuberculomas may remain asymptomatic throughout their life. Neuroimaging CT scan and MRI have a 100 % diagnostic sensitivity (Fig. 22.21); however, tissue confirmation is essential in order to rule out malignancies or other ring-enhancing, space-occupying lesions, such as pyogenic bacterial abscesses, neurocysticercosis, or toxoplasmosis [124, 260].\n\n",

Common clinical manifestations include constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, weight loss), back pain, spinal tenderness, paraplegia, and spinal deformities [277]. Symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis (i.e., paraparesis, loss or disturbance of sensation with a sensory level on the trunk, bowel and bladder dysfunction) and spinal block, as well as nerve root pain, paresthesia, and motor weakness, may be seen [163].",

This can be most easily demonstrated by the marked increase in the number of cases associated with HIV infection and the fact that as the CD4+ count decreases the incidence of cryptococcal infection increases markedly, particularly at CD4+ counts less than 200 cells/mm3.

Symptomatic patients usually present with fever and cough and a variety of chest radiographic findings, such as nodular, pleural-based lesions and lobar infiltrates. The initial pneumonia generally clears without treatment, even in immunosuppressed patients. Dissemination from the pneumonitis results in seeding of various organs in the body; the CNS is particularly vulnerable (Fig. 22.22a\u2013c). The organism may remain latent in the lung and at other sites indefinitely. Thus, most patients presenting with cryptococcal meningitis have no evidence of a concurrent pulmonary disease.\n\n",

Patients may develop raised ICP with papilledema (33 %), cranial nerve palsies (20 %), and seizures; if left untreated, the condition progresses to obtundation and, ultimately, death. Occasionally, total visual loss develops secondary to fungal involvement of the optic tracts, as well as from adhesive arachnoiditis, chorioretinitis, or elevated ICP. Hydrocephalus is a frequent complication even in patients who responded to therapy. Neuroimaging can reveal the extent of CNS involvement: Figure 22.23 shows C. neoformans involvement of the basal ganglia.\n\n",

            "text": "The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is usually not difficult. The classical and time-honored method for diagnosis is demonstration of the yeast in spinal fluid by India ink stain. Microscopically the India ink particles serve to outline the very large clear polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeast. The test is positive in over 90 % of HIV-infected patients, but in only 50 % of patients with normal immunity. Several latex agglutination tests have been developed that detect the excess polysaccharide capsule produced in the spinal fluid of patients with cryptococcal meningitis. This test is positive in over 95 % of patients with the condition. While the test is highly reliable, it is important to recognize that there can be both false-negative and false-positive reactions. For example, HIV-infected patients with overwhelming cryptococcal meningitis may have so much polysaccharide capsule in their CSF that a \u201cprozone\u201d effect occurs, resulting in the finding that undiluted CSF or CSF tested at a 1:2 dilution may appear negative. Generally, upon dilution of the spinal fluid to 1:10 or greater, a positive reaction will be observed. Laboratories must be aware of this prozone effect and physicians who suspect cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients should alert the laboratory to ensure that this possibility is not overlooked. In addition, cross-reactions with Trichosporon beigelii or Capnocytophaga may occasionally produce false-positive latex agglutination tests. The latex agglutination should be confirmed by growth of cryptococci in culture. If a positive cryptococcal antigen titer is found in the CSF from a patient for whom CSF culture did not yielded growth of Cryptococcus spp., the antigen test cannot be assumed to be false-positive\u2014a large volume (10\u201320 mL) of CSF should be obtained for repeating the cryptococcal antigen test and reculturing for cryptococcus. The higher the cryptococcal antigen titer, the less likely it is to be a false-positive result. CSF changes in cryptococcal meningitis generally parallel those of chronic tuberculous meningitis and other chronic meningitides (Table 22.2). CSF analysis is typically abnormal as follows: glucose is generally less than 40 mg/dL, protein is elevated in the large majority of patients, and the white count is usually elevated with a lymphocytic predominance.",

In patients with no underlying chronic illness or history of HIV infection, IV amphotericin B at a dose of 0.5\u20130.8 mg/kg/day together with oral flucytosine 37.5 mg/kg every 8 h should be administered until the patient becomes afebrile and culture-negative; generally, this takes approximately 6 weeks. This should probably be followed by a course of fluconazole 400 mg/day for an additional 2\u20133 months. Flucytosine may cause severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, which, in turn, may develop as a result of amphotericin therapy. Therefore, patients need to be monitored carefully for these particular toxic side effects. Some authorities recommend measuring flucytosine levels and adjusting the dose to give a peak of 70\u201380 mcg/L and a trough of 30\u201340 mcg/L. However, services for routine measurement of these levels may not be readily available at many hospitals. Alternative therapeutic regimens include various lipid-soluble amphotericin B preparations, which may be used for patients who develop nephrotoxicity. If the patient is intolerant to flucytosine, therapy with amphotericin B at a higher dose of 0.7\u20131 mg/kg/day for 6\u20138 weeks may be considered. Fluconazole 400 mg/day orally for 8\u201310 weeks may be curative, particularly in non-immunocompromised patients who are less ill. However, it should be recognized that fluconazole alone is less effective than the combination of amphotericin B plus flucytosine: the length of time that CSF cultures remain positive is longer and rates of treatment failure tend to be higher for fluconazole-only therapeutic regimens.",

Therapy can be assessed with serial weekly or biweekly lumbar punctures for CSF Histoplasma antigen levels, white blood cell counts, and complement fixation antibody titers. A rise in the CSF glucose and fall in the CSF cell count and protein levels would suggest successful response to treatment. Resolution of abnormal findings can help determine the duration of therapy [283]. Approximately 80 % of patients will respond to amphotericin, but at least half of those initial responders will relapse and approximately 20 % will die from the disease. Treatment with Amphotericin B should be followed by an oral azole agent for an undetermined period of time. Primary therapy with itraconazole or fluconazole is not useful in the treatment of CNS histoplasmosis\u2014they do not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier particularly well, and failure rates are remarkably high. Kauffman has categorically stated that primary azole therapy of CNS histoplasmosis should be discouraged [283]. Both azoles have been used successfully for secondary treatment following induction therapy with amphotericin B [283]. The dosage suggested for itraconazole is 200 mg twice or thrice daily, and that for fluconazole is 800 mg daily. In HIV-infected patients, suppressive treatment with itraconazole 200 mg orally daily should begin after the initial course of amphotericin.",

If there is no response to azole therapy, amphotericin B at a dose of 0.1\u20130.3 mg/kg/day may be given intrathecally, optimally through an Ommaya reservoir. Intravenous amphotericin B has poor CSF penetration and has a limited role in the management of coccidioidal meningitis [289]. Recent studies on rabbit models suggest that lipid preparations of amphotericin B tend to have better penetration of brain parenchyma and meninges and might be effective in treating coccidioidal meningitis. However, such studies have yet to be duplicated in humans [293, 294]. With the demonstration of rising CSF glucose and falling white cell count and protein, this schedule of amphotericin B administration may be decreased to three times a week after 2\u20133 weeks of daily treatment, and maintenance may be achieved with twice weekly or once weekly injections. Treatment with either oral fluconazole or intrathecal amphotericin B must be prolonged for at least 2 years after the spinal fluid becomes completely normal.

Pulmonary manifestations vary from asymptomatic to overwhelming multilobar infection with involvement of hilar lymph nodes. From there, dissemination to skin and other organs may occur via lymphohematogenous spread. Normal host responses generate a characteristic pyogranulomatous reaction. Extrapulmonary involvement in descending order of frequency include skin (25 %), osteoarticular (25 %), genitourinary (17 %), and CNS (5 %) disease [295\u2013299]. CNS disease is more common in immunocompromised patients, for example, 40 % of patients with AIDS who have blastomycosis also have CNS involvement as meningitis or mass lesions [295, 300, 301]. Less common metastatic sites include the liver, spleen, and naso-/oropharynx. Chronic pulmonary infection resembling tuberculosis or other chronic fungal disease may develop. Dissemination to the skin produces a variety of clinical manifestations, such as chronic verrucous lesions with crusting and purulent drainage, giant keratoacanthoma, and lesions mimicking pyoderma gangrenosum or squamous cell carcinoma. Suppurative granulomatous lesions of the skin and bone may develop and become chronic.",

These saprophytic organisms are ubiquitous in the environment, especially soil and commonly found on bread. The genuses Absidia, Rhizopus, and Mucor can invade the CNS by direct extension or from hematogenous spread. Disseminated disease occurring via the hematogenous route may produce CNS mucormycosis resulting in infarction and abscess formation. The Zygomycetes tend to invade the paranasal sinuses or palate with subsequent progression through tissue, nerves, blood vessels, and fascial planes, followed by the vital structures at the base of the brain (Fig. 22.24a, b). In patients with diabetes, this disease typically presents as rhinocerebral mucor (Fig. 22.25). Patients are generally predisposed to this complication if their serum glucose has remained uncontrolled, and the patient has been acidotic for several weeks. Initial symptoms usually include sinus pain, headache, fever, and nasal stuffiness and discharge, which quickly progresses to facial cellulitis, swelling, proptosis, carotid artery occlusion, cavernous sinus thrombosis, CNS infarction due to fungal thrombosis, CNS hemorrhage, abscess, cerebritis, blindness, and airway obstruction caused by head and neck infections. Death ensues if the condition is not treated. Other at-risk populations include persons who have been neutropenic for more than 2\u20133 weeks, iron overload, burns, HIV infection and AIDS, blood dyscrasias, transplantation, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, IV drug abuse, and high-dose steroids. Patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis may manifest hyperglycemia and a metabolic acidosis. Lumbar puncture and CSF analysis invariably reveal a raised opening pressure, a neutrophilic pleocytosis, normal or slightly elevated protein levels, and low glucose levels. In most cases, however, CSF study findings are normal [318]. Neuroimaging studies help to support the diagnosis of rhinocerebral mucormycosis and to precisely determine the extent of disease. CT scanning and MRI reveal soft tissue extent of infection, mucosal thickening, and bony destruction of the sinuses and orbit, presence of cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebritis, and cerebral edema (Fig. 22.25). Tissue biopsy is necessary to demonstrate the invasive hyphae. The Zygomycetes all appear as ribbon-like nonseptate hyphae in tissue with right- or obtuse-angle branching (Fig. 22.24b). Treatment of the condition is based on three main principles: rapid reversal of underlying predisposing factors, antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, and timely surgical intervention. Treatment includes control of the underlying predisposing condition (e.g., control of diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoxia, and electrolyte abnormalities), IV amphotericin B in a dose of at least 1 mg/kg/day, together with vigorous surgical debridement of all involved tissue. Dexamethasone has been used to treat brain edema. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis carries a prognosis of high morbidity and mortality. Survival depends on the reversibility of underlying risk factors and early surgical intervention [319].\n\n\n",

Patients with prolonged and profound neutropenia (less than 100 cells /\u03bcL) are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis. Colonization with Aspergillus spp. can lead to tissue invasion with branching septate hyphae that are best visualized in tissue with silver stains and histologically distinct from other fungi\u2014i.e., Aspergillus spp. have frequent septae that branch at 45\u00b0 angles. Lung invasion can involve blood vessels leading to hematogenous spread. The majority of invasive CNS infections occur in immunosuppressed transplant patients in the hospital who had pulmonary disease that progressed to brain involvement via hematogenous dissemination. Compared with persons with uncontrolled diabetes who are more susceptible to infections caused by mucor, patients with prolonged neutropenia appear to be more susceptible to invasive Aspergillus spp. sinus infection with direct extension from the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with progression to cavernous sinus thrombosis. Voriconazole which has good CNS tissue penetration is usually first-line therapy with surgical debridement of all infected tissue. High-dose amphotericin B may be considered in treatment failure [320].",

However, in the large majority of cases, primary infection is asymptomatic and only becomes recognized under conditions of extreme immunosuppression, such as occurs when CD4+ counts in HIV-infected individuals fall to levels less than 100 cells/mm3, when the cysts break down and initiate symptomatic infection. In immunocompromised patients, reactivation of latent disease can cause life-threatening encephalitis. Patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis generally present with a syndrome of fever, headache and varying degrees of confusion, lethargy, obtundation, focal neurologic signs developing over a period of 1\u20133 weeks, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. In some patients, the presentation can be abrupt, with seizures or cerebral hemorrhage. Hemiparesis and abnormalities of speech are quite common. Less commonly, brain stem involvement may result in cranial nerve deficits, while dyskinesias such as Parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, and hemiballismus may also accompany the presenting syndromes. Patients occasionally present with endocrine abnormalities due to involvement of the pituitary axis as well as psychiatric manifestations, such as psychoses and dementia.",

In an HIV-infected patient, the finding of single or multiple ring-enhancing lesions by CT or MRI scanning strongly suggests toxoplasma encephalitis (Fig. 22.26a\u2013c). If the patient is also known to be, or is found to be, serologically positive for antibodies to toxoplasma, the combination is virtually diagnostic. In patients with a single lesion, the major differential is lymphoma, and a brain biopsy may be required to make a definitive diagnosis. MRI has superior sensitivity when compared with CT scanning and should therefore be used as the initial diagnostic procedure when feasible. Toxoplasmic encephalitis lesions on MRI appear as high-signal abnormalities on T2-weighted studies and have a rim of enhancement surrounding the edema on T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced images. Other imaging techniques, such as PET, radionuclide (e.g., Thallium 201) scanning, and magnetic resonance techniques have been used to evaluate patients with AIDS who have focal CNS lesions and to specifically differentiate between toxoplasmosis and primary CNS lymphoma. Grossly, the acute lesions are hemorrhagic, necrotic, space-occupying lesions with surrounding edema. Histologically, there are cysts, free parasites, necrosis, and vasculitis (Fig. 22.27a, b).

The review also found that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which is cheap and readily available in developing countries, may be suitable first-line therapy for acute toxoplasmic encephalitis in HIV-infected individuals and, in fact, was not found to be inferior compared with pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine [325]. More recent studies indicate that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is indeed an alternative treatment for toxoplasmic encephalitis because it is inexpensive, well tolerated, and as effective as pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine [326]. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be given 3\u20135 mg/kg of the trimethoprim component orally or IV every 12 h for 4\u20136 weeks. Other potential advantages of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole include less adverse events, ease of dosing, parenteral formulation, cost, and accessibility [326\u2013328]. Pereira-Chioccola and colleagues recommend that complications, such as expansive brain lesions with a mass effect (e.g., deviation of the middle line structures or imminent risk of cerebral herniation) and cases with diffuse encephalitis should be administered adjunctive corticosteroid therapy.

If there is no clinical or radiographic response within 10 days, alternative diagnoses and brain biopsy must be considered. Reactivation of latent infection in the CNS is a common HIV/AIDS-related complication. Thus, current guidelines recommend that patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis should be treated with the initial regimen for 4\u20136 weeks, depending upon the degree and rapidity of improvement, and then receive lifelong suppression with sulfadiazine 500\u20131,000 mg orally four times daily and with pyrimethamine 25\u201375 mg and folinic acid 10\u201320 mg both by mouth daily. Patients on long-term maintenance treatment for cerebral toxoplasmosis have a low risk for subsequently developing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This decreased risk is thought to be the result of chronic suppressive treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides [330]. More recent data suggest that discontinuation of maintenance therapy against toxoplasmic encephalitis for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS, who are receiving successful antiretroviral therapy, might be safe and that patients who remain clinically and radiologically free of relapse at 6 months after discontinuation are unlikely to experience a relapse of toxoplasmic encephalitis [331, 332]. However, the overall body of published data in support of a policy that recommends discontinuing secondary prophylaxis remains relatively limited at the present time.",

Ganciclovir blocks CMV replication by inhibiting CMV DNA polymerase. Alternatively, foscarnet 90 mg/kg, adjusted for renal function, can be given IV twice daily for 2\u20133 weeks. Following induction with ganciclovir or foscarnet, HAART therapy can then be given in the hope of sustained improvement in CD4+ count and maintenance of a response to therapy. In the pre-HAART era, CMV encephalitis responded relatively poorly to ganciclovir, with survival generally in the 3\u20134 month range. The suppression of HIV replication and elevation in CD4 cells observed during HAART may allow AIDS patients to undergo immune reconstitution. Discontinuation of maintenance CMV therapy for these patients may be considered in these patients [332, 342, 343].

HIV infection itself causes CNS complications, including encephalitis and dementia. Encephalopathy usually develops as part of the acute HIV syndrome during the seroconversion phase. Two pathogenic mechanisms are thought to underlie these CNS conditions. In the first mechanism, HIV and its fragments induce damage directly or indirectly through the accumulation of infected or activated macrophage and microglia cells that release neurotoxic mediators including both cellular activation products and viral proteins [345, 346]. The accumulation of these activated macrophage/microglia cells, some of which are infected, release a number of cytokines and small molecule mediators and viral proteins that act on bystander cells. These viral proteins and cellular products have neurotoxic properties and act directly and through induction of astrocyte dysfunction, leading to neuronal injury [346\u2013348]. The second, less predominant, pathogenic mechanism is the ability of HIV to impair neurogenesis [349, 350]. Kaul suggests that both proposed pathogenic mechanisms occur side by side with other host-virus interactions [345].",

Cerebral malaria, in particular, is the most prominent and serious of these complications. Attributable mortality remains relatively high (20 %) and is often associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment. As P. falciparum trophozoites mature in the red blood cells, they induce the formation of small knobs on the surface of the red cell. These knobs bind to adhesion molecules (also known as intercellular adhesion molecule-1) on the microvascular endothelial cells, leading to sequestration. Sequestration is the process whereby erythrocytes containing mature forms of P. falciparum adhere to microvascular endothelial cells resulting in marked reduction or disappearance of these cells from the circulation. Sequestration of erythrocytes in small blood vessels and consequent obstruction of microcirculatory flow is a specific property of P falciparum and an important mechanism causing coma and death in cerebral malaria. The second important factor in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is the increase in cytokine production. In an attempt to control the infection, the host immune system produces a potent proinflammatory response in which cells of the macrophage-monocyte series are induced to release various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 [353]. However, this response may also induce complications, such as severe anemia, hypoglycemia, and cerebral malaria.",

Furthermore, parasitized erythrocytes tend to adhere to adjacent uninfected cells leading to rosetting. In addition, as the parasite matures inside the erythrocyte, the normally flexible cell becomes more spherical and rigid. Because of the rosetting and increased rigidity of parasitized erythrocytes, the erythrocytes become trapped in the capillaries. The end result of cytoadherence, rosetting, and rigidity is the enhancement of sequestration of P. falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral vasculature, stagnation of the cerebral blood flow, and secondary ischemia leading to tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and prevention of delivery of nutrients to the tissues. High concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 can precipitate cerebral malaria by increasing the sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes. Although all tissues potentially can become involved, the brain is the most profoundly affected [354\u2013362].",

Once the diagnosis is considered likely, parenteral quinidine gluconate should be started. The recommended therapeutic regimen includes a loading dose of 6.25 mg base/kg (=10 mg salt/kg) infused intravenously over 1\u20132 h followed by a continuous infusion of 0.0125 mg base/kg/min (=0.02 mg salt/kg/min).

Quinidine gluconate therapy should be combined with doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin. If the patient is unable to tolerate oral therapy, doxycycline (100 mg every 12 h) or clindamycin (5 mg base/kg every 8 h) may be given intravenously until the patient can be switched to oral therapy [354, 356, 359].

Acanthamoeba spp. are usually found in soil and in fresh and brackish water. Most cases in the United States, typically children or young adults, occur in the southeastern states. Clinically, patients present with sudden onset of high fever, photophobia, and headaches; progression to obtundation occurs relatively quickly. There is usually a classic history of swimming or waterskiing in warm, freshwater lakes. The amoebae invade the nasal cavity along the blood vessels associated with the olfactory nerves and traverse the cribriform plate to reach the frontal lobes and the surrounding meninges, where they rapidly produce a highly necrotizing, purulent, and destructive encephalitis. Because of the olfactory involvement, there may be alterations of smell or taste. Otherwise, nonspecific symptoms such as confusion, irritability, restlessness, and seizures with rapid progression to delirium, stupor, and coma ensue. The CSF is usually bloody, shows a leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, low glucose levels, and elevated protein.

Patients with inactive parenchymal neurocysticercosis generally have no evidence of viable or degenerating parasites; the utility of antiparasitic drugs in these patients remains limited. However, these patients are at increased risk of developing seizures, and standard anticonvulsive therapy with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine is indicated. Patients who develop hydrocephalus need to be treated with ventricular peritoneal shunting. Virtually all patients with active neurocysticercosis have seizures, which must be treated with anticonvulsants. Probably the majority of these patients can be treated symptomatically and followed by MRI because the cysticerci typically undergo complete degeneration over a 1- to 2-year period. This process results in either calcified inactive cysticerci that continue to induce seizures thereby requiring continued therapy with anticonvulsants or, in a majority, a normal MRI in which case anticonvulsants may be tapered as long as the patients remain seizure free.",

Albendazole has been superior to praziquantel in trials comparing the efficacy of these drugs [376, 377, 379]. Another advantage of albendazole is that it also destroys subarachnoid and ventricular cysts [380, 381]. In some of these cases, particularly in patients with large subarachnoid cysts, higher doses (up to 30 mg/kg/day) or more prolonged, or even repeated, courses of albendazole may be needed. Although these agents kill the cysticerci, some controlled trials have not shown any clinical benefit over symptomatic treatment alone [382\u2013384]. The main adverse side effect of praziquantel is worsening neurologic function, i.e., headaches, dizziness, seizures, and increased ICP probably as a result of an increase in the host inflammatory response and cerebral edema due to the larval death. There is a strong consensus that there is no role for anti-cysticidal drugs in patients with only calcified lesions and those patients with single enhancing lesions will do well regardless of antiparasitic therapy [385]. Riley and White point out that while antiparasitic therapy is indicated in patients with multiple subarachnoid cysticerci or giant cysticerci they are contraindicated in patients with cerebral edema (cysticercal encephalitis) [385].",

Recent studies have found fewer shunt failures when such patients are treated with antiparasitic drugs [386\u2013388]. Cysticercosis involving the basilar cisterns is associated with a prominent inflammatory arachnoiditis and can be complicated by both vasculitis, resulting in lacunar infarctions, and invasion of the cysticerci into larger vessels, resulting in strokes.

The diagnosis may be suspected from radiographic appearance of the cyst itself seen on CT scanning or MRI. Classic radiographic features include a sharp, spherical border lacking a rim of enhancement or surrounding edema, although a fine rim of peripheral enhancement with perilesional edema may be seen if active inflammation is present.

Patients with intracranial hydatid cysts usually present with focal neurological deficit and features of raised intracranial pressure due to interference with CSF flow. The treatment of hydatid cyst is surgical and the aim of the surgery is to excise the cyst in toto without rupture to prevent recurrence and anaphylactic reaction. Albendazole therapy is given in a daily dose of 10 mg/kg, taken three times for 4 months. It is a broad-spectrum oral antihelminthic drug, which acts by blocking glucose uptake of the larva and adult worm. The glycogen stores are thus depleted thereby decreasing the ATP formation resulting in death of the parasite. Albendazole can decrease the size of large cysts and cause smaller ones to disappear.",

Normally, the adult worms bore into the mucosa and produce eggs, which pass out with stool. The eggs deposited by the female may hatch the rhabditiform larvae that enter the lumen of the intestine to be passed out in stool. Eggs released from these organisms normally mature in the soil to produce more rhabditiform larvae. In the environment, these larvae transform to the filariform infective larvae that can directly penetrate intact skin of humans and other mammals. For reasons not fully understood, in some patients the transformation from rhabditiform to the filariform infective larvae can also occur while still in the lower bowel or perianal area, before being passed out in the stool. The filariform larvae burrow through the intestinal wall and perianal skin to reinfect the patient, a phenomenon known as autoinfection. After burrowing through the skin, the filariform larvae enter the lymphatics and, ultimately, the venous system where they are carried to the pulmonary capillaries. Here, they migrate out of the blood vessels into alveoli, up the airways and then down through the esophagus to reach the small bowel. Symptoms include ground itch, urticarial, and pulmonary symptoms. A worm burden in the intestines might lead to a malabsorption syndrome.

The primary chancre is frequently associated with regional, nonsuppurative, nontender lymphadenopathy. The chancre generally heals spontaneously within 3\u20136 weeks. The incubation period from exposure to clinical disease can range anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months. Spirochetemia occurs at the onset of the primary chancre. For a period of 2\u20138 weeks following the primary chancre, the treponemes migrate to the lymphatics and gain access to the circulation to cause a systemic illness (the secondary syphilis phase) in approximately 30 % of untreated patients. Systemic manifestations of secondary syphilis include fever, malaise, headache, pharyngitis, anorexia, weight loss, and arthralgias. The classic manifestations are maculopapular, papular, or pustular skin lesions, which are distributed over the entire body, including the palms and soles and patients may develop patchy alopecia. Genital ulcerations, such as condylomata lata and mucous patches, develop in about 20\u201335 % of those with clinically evident secondary syphilis.",

This category includes two classical syndromes: general paresis and tabes dorsalis. In contradistinction to the pathogenesis of syphilitic meningitis or meningovascular syphilis, these syndromes result from progressive neuronal destruction with fibrosis and atrophy rather than ischemic damage from vasculitis. General paresis, also known as general paralysis of the insane, is a chronic progressive meningoencephalitis with a peak incidence 10\u201320 years after acquisition of syphilis. Patients generally present with gradual deterioration of mental functioning characterized by difficulties in concentration, irritability, and deficits of higher cognitive function. As the condition progresses, these manifestations become more obvious and symptoms may mimic psychiatric disease, including delusions, paranoia, emotional lability, memory loss, or dementia. Difficulties with motor control then develop with a loss of facial muscle and extremity tone, loss of fine motor control, and the development of tremors and dysarthria. Subsequently, patients may have seizures, loss of bowel and bladder control, and paralysis; the pupils become unresponsive to light and painful stimuli and may be constricted and unequal in size (the Argyll Robertson pupil). Untreated, the disease follows a progressive or subacute course over 3\u20134 years. Pathologically there is diffuse cortical atrophy, dilatation of the ventricles, and neuronal dropout with accompanying gliosis. Spirochetes can be demonstrated in 25\u201340 % of patients with silver stain.

The classical early symptomatology is \u201clightning pains\u201d in the distribution of nerve roots. These pains are described as lancinating, lasting for minutes to hours, and most often involve the lower extremities. Ten percent to 20 % of patients with tabes may also present with episodic attacks of abdominal pain. In addition to pain, some patients experience episodic paresthesias. Ultimately, patients experience progressive loss of vibration and proprioceptive sensation, particularly in the lower extremities. As a result, the patients exhibit a characteristic broad-based, shuffling gait and may develop Charcot joints. Muscular atrophy develops in approximately 20 % of patients. The Argyll Robertson pupil, in which one or both pupils constrict with accommodation but do not react directly to light, is a characteristic feature of both general paresis and tabes dorsalis. Pathologically there is atrophy of the posterior columns of the spinal cord with inflammatory infiltrates and loss of neurons. In contrast to paresis, it is unusual to be able to stain the spirochete in nerve tissue. The diagnosis is readily made from the characteristic neurologic findings together with positive serology.

Patients with lesions on moist skin or mucous membranes during either primary or secondary syphilis can usually be diagnosed by the demonstration of treponemes on dark-field microscopy. While treponemes can be demonstrated in dry lesions or lymph nodes by biopsy or saline aspiration, the yield is considerably lower. Serologic tests for syphilis are generally divided into two different types: nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests measure IgG or IgM antibodies directed at cardiolipin, which is released when the treponeme damages cells during an infection. Thus, a positive nontreponemal test is indicative of an active infection, but a confirmatory test with a treponemal test is required to verify that it is indeed a syphilis infection that is causing elevated cardiolipin levels. Currently, a standardized mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol, and lecithin which has fewer false-positive reactions is used and forms the basis of today\u2019s standardized tests. The most common of these are the classic venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), in which agglutination of the cardiolipin, cholesterol, and lecithin antigen is carried out on a slide using heated serum; the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test; the automated reagin test (ART); or the toluidine red unheated test (TRUST). Because of the stringency of the technical requirements for the test, the VDRL is generally performed only on CSF and serum screening tests are generally done with the RPR and its variants. Specific treponemal tests for syphilis include the T. pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test, the microhemagglutination test with T. pallidum antigen, the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-abs), the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the hemagglutination treponemal test for syphilis (HATTS).",

However, this will increase with the duration of the chancre during primary infection to approximately 70 % for both the treponemal and nontreponemal tests by the time the chancre heals.

The insensitivity of the CSF-VDRL test limits its usefulness as a screening test for neurosyphilis. The CSF-FTA-abs test appears more sensitive for screening CSF but is less specific than the CSF-VDRL test in distinguishing currently active neurosyphilis from past syphilis. These findings imply that clinical judgment remains the sine qua non for establishing the diagnosis of active neurosyphilis. Most other tests are both insensitive and nonspecific and must be interpreted in relation to other test results and the clinical assessment. Furthermore, one cannot use the more sensitive treponemal antibody tests with CSF to diagnose neurosyphilis as these antibodies cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and are therefore likely to be present in the CSF of all patients who have positive serum treponemal tests for syphilis. Thus, a positive CSF treponemal test does not provide any additional information to that obtained by testing serum alone.

Patients with syphilitic meningitis or meningovascular syphilis generally respond to treatment with the exception of cases in which the patient has focal cranial nerve abnormalities associated with syphilitic meningitis or larger ischemic defects caused by the arteritis associated with meningovascular syphilis.",

In one study, 89 % of 454 patients who initially had \u226510 leukocytes/mm3 of CSF had normalized their cell counts at a 1-year follow-up, as had 69 % of those with abnormal protein prior to treatment [412]. Because patients with primary and secondary syphilis are curable with standard treatment of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for three weekly doses, the question of proper treatment always arises when an asymptomatic patient is found to have a positive VDRL, RPR, or other screening test for syphilis. The problem is that this regimen does not reliably provide CSF levels in excess of 0.018 \u03bcg/mL of CSF in all patients, which is believed to be necessary to kill spirochetes within the CNS [413\u2013415]. The treatment of cerebral gummas is IV penicillin G with neuroimaging follow-up recommended for most patients [416]. Surgery should be reserved for those unresponsive to antibiotics or those with acutely elevated intracranial pressure [416]. All patients found to have serologic evidence of syphilis, assuming that false-positive tests such as those due to pregnancy and other intercurrent illness can be ruled out, should have serologic testing for HIV because the ability to eradicate syphilis is considerably lower in HIV-infected patients and re-treatment may be necessary.",

Approximately 50 % of untreated patients progress to disseminated disease. During the first stage, the earliest manifestations of Lyme disease occur at the site of the tick bite beginning as a red macule or papule that may expand to an area 10\u201315 cm with red outer borders and partial central clearing\u2014the so-called \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d skin rash. The lesion develops as early as 3 days and as late as 30 days following the initial bite and generally lasts 3\u20134 weeks. It is most commonly located on the thigh or groin and develops in approximately 80 % of patients [419, 423, 424]. Following the entry of the spirochete into the patient via the tick bite, dissemination of the spirochete occurs during the development of this initial lesion, and while some patients may develop multiple secondary annular lesions that are similar to the primary site lesion, others may clear the infection without developing symptoms. All patients largely remain seropositive. In the second stage, the organism produces symptoms by direct invasion. Systemic symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, and malaise along with generalized lymphadenopathy, meningismus, encephalopathy, migratory musculoskeletal pain, splenomegaly, sore throat, and cough may develop in varying degrees during this early disseminated phase [423, 424]. For the most part, the systemic manifestations as well the erythema chronicum migrans lesions themselves usually resolve without treatment in 3\u20134 weeks. Untreated, however, the Lyme disease spirochete becomes sequestered and persists in various tissues, particularly the CNS, joints, heart, and the skin.",

The most common neurologic symptoms are speech abnormalities, limb weakness, gait difficulties, ataxia, bladder dysfunction, visual changes, hearing loss, mood changes, sleep disorders, and deteriorating memory and concentration. Symptoms of late progressive Lyme encephalomyelitis may develop either acutely or gradually and then worsen progressively over the ensuing months to years [427, 429\u2013438]. Progression may be gradual or stepwise, characterized by sudden deterioration and only partial improvement between episodes. Headaches, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness have been reported but occur less often, while mental deficits such as behavioral changes, poor memory, and concentration are common. More severe changes including confusion, disorientation, dementia, delirium, and somnolence can occur. Symptoms such as apraxia, myoclonus, hemiparesthesia, and visual field abnormalities have been reported. Spinal cord involvement is common and myelitis may present as a progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis that can become very severe. Approximately 45 % of patients have cranial nerve palsies; involvement of the optic, facial, oculomotor, and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves have all been reported [426, 431, 439].

These patients complain of overwhelming fatigue, accompanied by loss of memory and concentration, and almost always without physical neurologic abnormalities. Psychological testing shows abnormalities or dysfunction in memory, ability to learn or acquire new information, attention span, concentration, problem solving, perceptual motor performance, and verbal fluency. Although depression and irritability are frequently reported, general fatigue appears to be the overriding complaint. Many of these patients fit the definition of the chronic fatigue syndrome as defined by the CDC. Objective laboratory and radiographic signs of infection are generally absent. CSF pleocytosis is present in less than 5 % of the cases, and CSF protein is elevated in only a minority of patients. Oligoclonal bands for B. burgdorferi are absent and patients with these complaints may or may not have antibodies to Lyme disease in the serum. Some of these patients have been reported to have MRI abnormalities, such as focal areas of increased signal in deep cerebral white matter [441, 450\u2013452]. In general, symptoms in these patients do not improve spontaneously. A variable number of persons with this condition apparently do respond to courses of antimicrobial therapy, sometimes for 6 months or more [441, 450\u2013453].",

CDC recommends a two-step approach for serological testing: the first step in the workup of patients with putative Lyme symptoms is to obtain an antibody titer using an ELISA test to screen for the presence of antibody; the second step is confirmation of positive titers with a Western blot assay; both IgG and IgM antibodies are formed. However, persistence of the IgM antibody alone in the absence of an IgG response after the first month of illness may signal a false-positive reaction. After the first 1\u20132 months of infection, over 90 % of patients will have a specific IgG antibody response to the spirochete.

For RMSF, the incubation period between tick bite and onset of illness is 2\u20136 days. Fever, headache, rash, mental confusion, and myalgia are the predominant clinical features [469\u2013471]. The rash usually develops on the second or third day of illness, initially on the wrists and ankles followed by spread to the trunk within hours. In contrast with a viral exanthem, the RMSF rash can appear on the palms and soles. About 25 % of patients may have an encephalitis at presentation with lethargy, confusion, or delirium. This may deteriorate to seizures and coma. As a result of the variability of the vessels involved in the CNS, a wide range of clinical neurologic features are associated with RMSF, including seizures, deafness, facial diplegia, gaze palsies, nystagmus, ataxia, dysphasia, transverse myelitis, neurogenic bladder, hemiplegia, and paraplegia or quadriplegia.",

Because culture of rickettsiae is difficult, serological testing remains the mainstay of confirming the diagnosis. However, though serologic diagnosis is highly accurate, it is not readily available in most institutions or as a routine service in the acute setting, and therefore treatment must be started empirically; patients with RMSF who received antirickettsial therapy within 5 days of the onset of symptoms are significantly less likely to die than those in whom therapy, for whatever reasons, was delayed [472].",

In adults and children, the recommended dose is doxycycline 100 mg per dose administered twice daily (orally or intravenously) for adults or 2.2 mg/kg body weight per dose administered twice daily (orally or intravenously) for children weighing less than 100 lbs (45.4 kg) [470]. Previously, for children under the age of 8 years, chloramphenicol was recommended because of the tooth discoloration associated with tetracyclines. However, in 1997, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases revised its recommendations and identified doxycycline as the drug of choice for treating presumed or confirmed RMSF in children of any age, because of the effectiveness of this antimicrobial in reducing attributable morbidity and potential mortality.

Long-term neurological sequelae includes paraparesis; hearing loss; peripheral neuropathy; bladder and bowel incontinence; cerebellar, vestibular, and motor dysfunction; and language disorders [473]. Sexton and colleague made the point that the mechanism of such abnormalities is rickettsia-induced vasculitis with subsequent infarction of neural tissue and that although early treatment may prevent many, but not all, such complications, other factors, such as age and race, might be playing a role in the pathogenesis of severe disease [474].",

Macroscopically, the duodenal mucosa is pale yellow with dilated villi and ecstatic lymph vessels [479]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains will reveal the presence of PAS positive material (e.g., mucin and carbohydrate) with occasional bacilliform organisms. Pathologic involvement of the brain is most often manifest by chalky, yellowish white, 1\u20132 mm nodules distributed diffusely throughout the cortical and subcortical gray matter of both the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The most frequently involved sites are the temporal, periventricular, and periaqueductal gray matter as well as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia. Histologically, the nodules are made up of microglia that stain strongly positive with PAS.

Moreover, because of the wide range of conditions in the differential diagnosis of degenerative CNS diseases, tissue biopsy is generally required for diagnosis. For CNS disease, immunohistochemistry testing using specific antibodies is more sensitive than PAS staining by being able to identify T. whipplei in tissues, including those with negative PAS staining [479, 492]. CNS involvement, consistent with the characteristic clinical syndromes of Whipple\u2019s disease, and occurring in the setting of neuroimaging studies, biopsy proven systemic Whipple\u2019s disease, or PCR are also sufficiently diagnostic [493, 494].",

The initial treatment of CNS involvement in Whipple\u2019s disease is ceftriaxone 2 g IV once daily or procaine penicillin G 1\u20132 million units IM once daily, with streptomycin 1 g IM daily and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole one DS tablet three times daily for 14 days, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole one DS tablet twice daily for at least 1 year [479, 484]. Some clinicians continue therapy for 2 years to life. For severe CNS disease with cerebral lesions, Schneider and colleagues recommend consideration of adjunct corticosteroid therapy as outlined in the guidelines for tuberculous meningitis [271, 479]. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis of CNS Whipple\u2019s disease is not good. With antimicrobial therapy, disease progression can be halted, but significant clinical improvement is limited, relapses are frequent, and established neurological defects are difficult to reverse.",

Thus, for HIV-infected persons with PML, the basis of therapy remains the initiation of antiretroviral therapy for persons who are not on therapy and optimizing the antiretroviral regimen to achieve virologic suppression in patients who are already receiving antiretroviral therapy [323]. With rapid reversal of immunosuppression followed by immunologic recovery, patients may suffer a paradoxical clinical deterioration termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [499]. High-dose corticosteroids are often recommended if a clinical and imaging syndrome resembling IRIS develops after immune restoration. The JC virus DNA detection in CSF by nucleic acid amplification techniques and the CD4+ cell count are the most promising prognostic marker; higher levels of CD4+ cell counts are associated with improved survival [512].",

Generalized atrophy is one of the features of primary HIV involvement of brain (Reproduced with permission from Rand et al. [521])",

These images demonstrate the features of chronic neurocysticercosis. The frontal lesion is calcified as evident on the CT. However, it also produces local inflammation evident on the enhanced MR image. This local inflammatory reaction frequently can produce seizure activity. Hence, late state neurocysticercosis can be a mimic for cortical oligodendroglioma. (b) Neurocysticercosis; images include a panorama of the MRI sequences in the mid-convexity level of the brain including pre and post-contrast DT1-w sequences and T2-w spin echo sequences which illustrate typical findings of neurocysticercosis. The findings in this case are those of cystic nodules scattered in brain and in the depths of the sulci. The margins of the lesion show reactive hyperemia. Within some of the lesions an organism scolex is evident confirming the basis for the nodules. (c) Neurocysticercosis. A 25-year-old male from Latin America with a lateral ventricular cyst.

Findings in acute meningitis are frequently subtle especially viral meningitis. The FLAIR sequence. A presents normal CSF within the ventricles and sulci as hypointense (dark) relative to brain. With pial inflammation there is leak of proteinaceous fluid into the subpial and subdural spaces. This highly proteinaceous fluid is hyperintense (bright relative to brain) and thus becomes visualized on fluid-sensitive MRI sequences. Serous subdural effusions are often present as well, which are imaged as high-intensity fluid outside the brain, as in this case, but without contrast enhancement along their surfaces. These types of fluid collections are considered noninfective and they typically clear spontaneously after medical treatment. The contrasted MRI (b) demonstrates pial hyperemia along the right lateral cerebral convexity (compare to left side). On the left there is thickening of the pia probably early subpial empyema. (c, d) Listeria rhombencephalitis; images include post-contrast T1-w section (c) and a T2-w sequence (d). When the distribution of the inflammatory process involves mainly the upper brain stem, as in this instance, it is described as rhombencephalitis. Rhombencephalitis is uncommon but is one the manifestations of Listeria-based meningitis, as in this case. Note there is relatively little abnormal enhancement in this case of Listeria infection. If there is thick obvious enhancement in a similar distribution, findings would be more consistent with a granulomatous infection, as in fungal or tuberculous meningitis. Similar findings can also be part of noninfectious granulomatous pial disease, as in neurosarcoidosis and non-Langerhans histiocytosis; thus, tissue confirmation is usually necessary",

All of these findings commonly occur in acute meningitis. Additionally, there are small bifrontal extra axial fluid collections without any signal along their margins which are consistent with likely sterile subdural effusions.
