Among both children and adults, acute respiratory tract illness results in significant morbidity, lost time from work, physician visits, and death. It has been calculated that throughout the world over two million deaths occur annually from acute respiratory disease.9 disease comprise the five taxonomically distinct families Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae and Adenoviridae. 9 The influenza viruses, which are comprised of types A, B and C, belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Types A and B have been associated with significant increases in mortality during epidemics. The disease may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. Immunization against influenza has been recommended for high-risk groups, and antiviral chemotherapy (amantadine) is available for the treatment and prophylaxis of all influenza A infections. The family Paramyxoviridae includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus which are a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections. RSV is a factor in severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children. Efforts to develop a vaccine for RSV have been ineffectual, but recent clinical trials with ribavirin as a small particle aerosol have been promising. The parainfluenza viruses, of which there are four human serotypes, are second only to RSV as a cause of lower respiratory tract illness. There is both a great need for and interest in developing a chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of these two viral, respiratory tract pathogens. The family Picornaviridae contains the genus Rhinovirus, which is composed of over a hundred distinct serotypes. viruses are recognized as the most important causative agents of the upper respiratory tract illness although technical difficulties appear to have hindered studies on vaccines and antiviral agents. The adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) are a ubiquitous group of doublestranded DNA viruses which are responsible for a wide variety of respiratory illnesses. These infections are most common among children, although acute respiratory disease and pneumonia are also common among military recruits. Two comprehensive reviews of viral respiratory diseases and measures for their control and treatment have been recently published. 8 p 9",

Most of these agents are directed against viral nucleic acid synthesis and require activation by a virus-induced thymidine kinase. Researchers are beginning to focus on other strategies which may produce broader spectrum antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action.
