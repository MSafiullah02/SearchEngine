Although mild and self-limited, damages to the skin should not be overlooked as they can lead to an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The associated symptoms of burning, itching or stinging can predispose HCWs to face touching behaviour, which has been implicated in viral transmission. 2 We believe that these PPE-associated cutaneous complications should not be overlooked. In this letter, we propose practical strategies that can be implemented by HCWs to mitigate cutaneous complications to various PPEs (see Table 1 ).",

Other types of gloves to consider include nitrile or vinyl gloves, if available. Application of hand creams, or hydrophobic compress with normal saline or topical zinc ointment after completing clinical duties can mitigate skin maceration. 4 One study reports that 59.6% of HCWs who regularly used N95 masks during the SARS pandemic developed facial acne while 35.8% of HCWs developed a facial rash from either ICD or ACD. 5 Similarly, prolonged goggle wear has led to urticaria, pressure injury, contact dermatitis, and acne vulgaris in HCWs. 4 Masks and goggles should be well-fitted to reduce pressure injuries, and when possible, full-face shields can replace facial PPE. Facial moisturizers or gels should be applied before wearing facial PPE. Severe skin indentation can be managed with hydropathic compress and povidone iodine diluted by normal saline at a ratio of 1:9 on the face. 4 Some facial masks are secured by anchoring to the ears, causing damage to the external ears and retroauricular skin areas due to pressure and/or prolonged exposure. 4 To avoid damage, we recommended wearing ear-independent masks when possible, covering retroauricular areas with a surgical cap prior to wearing ear-dependent PPE, clean and drying the external ear and canal and applying moisturizers to retroauricular skin.",
