We acknowledge the great impact of TURBT on urologists\u2019 daily workload and health care resources even in times of emergency. Nonetheless, we focused our analysis on the burden of major uro-oncologic surgeries on the basis of their higher likelihood of impacting hospital resources [1]. Specifically, such procedures are associated with higher costs (especially for minimally invasive approaches), a greater need for anaesthesiology and intensive care, and a higher risk of complications and longer hospitalisation. Since many urology associations, including the European Association of Urology (EAU) [2], recently provided guidance on triage of TURBT cases in times of emergency, further analyses focused on the burden of this specific intervention might be worth investigation.",

The possibility that patients might decline oncologic surgeries, even if considered as high priority, represents an additional (currently misinvestigated) concern for effective organisation of surgical activities during the COVID-19 period and beyond. To provide an insight on this point from our academic centres, we assessed the proportion of cancer patients declining intervention between March 9 and April 22, 2020 because of their fear of COVID-19. Overall, this was the case for approximately one in 20 patients in Florence, one in five patients in Turin, and more than one-third of patients in Milan.",

Although a universal template for the process of surgical informed consent remains elusive [3], the current unprecedented uncertainty should encourage our community to develop a uniform policy for COVID-19\u2013specific informed consent in urology.",
