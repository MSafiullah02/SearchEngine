            "text": "Cardiopulmonary nematodes in cats include different parasite species affecting feline lungs and the heart, with the metastrongyloid Aelurostrongylus abstrusus being the most frequent feline lungworm worldwide (Giannelli et al., 2017; Scott, 1973). Adult stages (length 5\u201311 mm, width 0.054\u20130.08 mm (Gerichter, 1949)) of this parasite are embedded in the lung parenchyma and produce eggs and larval stages causing verminous pneumonia (Hamilton, 1967; Hobmaier and Hobmaier, 1935; Schnyder et al., 2014a). Troglostrongylus sp. was described in the twenties (Vevers, 1923) and then neglected until recently, when the rediscovery of this parasite in single European countries such as Spain (Jefferies et al., 2010), Italy (Brianti et al., 2012; Di Cesare et al., 2014), Greece (Diakou et al., 2014) and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Alic et al., 2015) was reported. The adult nematodes of the latter can be easily differentiated from A. abstrusus: Troglostrongylus sp. parasites are located in bronchi and bronchioli, are larger (length 6.6\u201316.8 mm, width 0.2\u20130.4 mm (Gerichter, 1949)), males have clearly longer spicules and females have a different position of the vulva opening. However, the first stage larvae (L1) of both parasites, which are coughed up, swallowed and excreted in the faeces, are very similar (Brianti et al., 2012), potentially leading to diagnostic misinterpretations. A further rarely diagnosed feline lungworm is Oslerus rostratus (previously named Anaphilaroides rostratus): this parasite is also found in the lung parenchyma or embedded in peri-bronchial tissues, being larger than A. abstrusus (length 30\u201350 mm, width 0.34\u20130.69 mm (Gerichter, 1949)). In contrast, Capillaria aerophila (syn. Eucoleus aerophilus) is more common than Oslerus rostratus and is frequently observed in trachea, bronchi and bronchioli of foxes (Magi et al., 2015; Saeed et al., 2006), dogs and cats (Giannelli et al., 2017; Traversa et al., 2010). Capillaria sp. are thin filariform parasite with C. aerophila in cats being 12\u201319 mm long and 0.049\u20130.102 mm wide (Varcasia et al., 2014a) and diagnosis is accomplished by detection of characteristic eggs in faecal samples.",

Cats are considered imperfect hosts that may harbour immature or adult stages measuring several centimetres which are located in the right heart and the pulmonary artery or at ectopic localisations (Venco et al., 2015). Laboratory diagnosis in cats is challenging as antigen detection is insufficient and because cats are often amicrofilaraemic (Atkins et al., 2008; Genchi et al., 2008), meaning that they cannot be identified based on the detection of microfilariae in blood samples.",

The aforementioned ELISA is able to detect antibodies against A. abstrusus the earliest at two weeks after experimental infections and reaches a sensitivity of 100% ten weeks after infection.

Due to an unfavourable prognosis, the cat was euthanised and necropsied allowing further investigations. The histologic examination confirmed a bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy with a chronic interstitial nephritis, and enabled the detection of an unexpected parasite, A. vasorum, in the lung vessels. The occurrence of this parasite in dogs has been largely described in Europe, especially in the last twenty years, as the cause of canine angiostrongylosis inducing respiratory, neurological and other clinical signs (Koch and Willesen, 2009; Schnyder et al., 2010). Angiostrongylus vasorum-infected foxes, which are considered the natural reservoir of the parasite, are contributing to its spreading and establishment of endemic foci (Gillis-Germitsch et al., 2017a; Taylor et al., 2015). After the first description of A. vasorum in a dog kennel in Switzerland (Wolff et al., 1969), a gradual increase of affected dogs (Staebler et al., 2005) and foxes (Gillis-Germitsch and Schnyder, 2017) was observed approximately 30 years later. Despite its actual widespread occurrence in dogs, an infection with A. vasorum was initially not suspected in the case presented here, given that, to our knowledge, no previous natural infections of cats with this parasite have been described. In cats, A. abstrusus is the most frequent lungworm worldwide including Switzerland (Giannelli et al., 2017; Zottler et al., 2019). However, adult stages of A. abstrusus usually reside in the lung parenchyma of cats and are normally not observed in arterial vessels. Moreover, no antibodies against A. abstrusus were detected in serum or tissue fluid of this cat, excluding an infection with this parasite. Serology, i.e. a serological rapid assay based on a test developed for the detection of A. vasorum in dogs (Schnyder et al., 2014b), was previously used to test blood of badgers and wild cats, identifying animals infected with the nematodes Angiostrongylus daskalovi and Angiostrongylus chabaudi, respectively (Deak et al., 2017). Although A. chabaudi is very rarely described in domestic and wild cats and only in single European countries, the localisation of the nematode sections in the arterial vessels of the cat presented here and the histological absence of larval stages in the lungs were indicative for a potential A. chabaudi infection: in fact only wild but no domestic cats infected with A. chabaudi were patent (Diakou et al., 2016; Varcasia et al., 2014b), indicating that domestic cats are not suitable definitive hosts, not allowing maturation and release of L1 by adult female parasites. However, genetic analyses did not confirm the presence of A. chabaudi, despite the detection of nematode DNA in histological samples. Instead, ITS2 and COI sequencing both surprisingly confirmed an infection with A. vasorum: although patent infections with A. vasorum were observed in a wide range of canids and also in red pandas, badgers, stoats, weasels and even meerkats (Gillis-Germitsch et al., 2017b), the cat was not considered as a suitable definitive host for A. vasorum, as natural infections have never been observed before. Unfortunately, due to the progressing glomerular disease followed by euthanasia, no faecal samples could be collected from the here presented cat for confirmation of absence of larval stages and therefore patency. The tentative ELISAs for A. vasorum detection resulted negative. However, we would like to stress that the A. abstrusus ELISA for cats (Zottler et al., 2017; Gueldner et al., 2019) and the two ELISAs for circulating A. vasorum antigen detection and antibodies against the parasite (Schnyder et al., 2011; Schucan et al., 2012) have been well validated for cats and dogs, respectively, and optimal concentrations of the different test components were determined by a series of titration experiments. In absence of positive control sera of other cats infected with A. vasorum, it was not possible to perform these experiments. We therefore cannot differentiate if the A. vasorum ELISAs performed with the cat material were negative due to unsuitable testing or to true absence of circulating antigens or antibodies.",

            "text": "Experimental studies performed in the seventies demonstrated the development of adult male and female A. vasorum nematodes containing eggs in cats, but no larval excretion in the faeces (Guilhon and Cens, 1970). Of eight cats receiving 1\u2032000\u20132\u2032000 infective third stage larvae (L3), five developed respiratory clinical signs; six were necropsied and of these, all had pulmonary lesions. Overall, three cats harboured adult worms, of which two had females with eggs (Guilhon and Cens, 1970). In a more recent study, eighteen animals were inoculated with 50 L3: L1 were not observed in faeces, and only 14 worms were recovered, of which 11 were females and five of them were gravid (Dias et al., 2008). Among the above mentioned infected cats, two animals died within two weeks after inoculation: larval stages were identified in the pancreas in one and in the gall bladder of the other cat post mortem (Dias et al., 2008). Therefore, although not becoming patent, A. vasorum infections may be clinically relevant in cats. It was hypothesised that after penetration of the gastric mucosa, the ingested L3 may perform erratic migrations including to the before mentioned organs of cats (Dias et al., 2008). There are manifold descriptions of erratic nematode migrations leading to severe diseases when non-suitable hosts are infected with parasites of other hosts (i.e. the dog and cat ascarids Toxocara canis and T. cati migrating to the eyes or viscera of humans (Deplazes et al., 2011), or the subcutaneous canid filarial Dirofilaria repens causing tumor-like subcutaneous, ocular or pulmonary nodules also in humans (Genchi and Kramer, 2017). In infected dogs, ectopic larval stages of A. vasorum were observed in a number of organs such as brain, diaphragm, liver, pancreas and skin (Oliveira-Junior et al., 2004), and adult stages were found in the pericardial sac, in the bladder (Oliveira-Junior et al., 2004) or in distant blood vessels such as the femoral arteries (Cury and Lima, 1996). However, we were not able to confirm erratic migrations in this cat: several organs were macroscopically and histologically altered in the present case, but no ectopic parasitic stages were found. The cause for the kidney changes is not clear: the only description of a cat with renal glomerular fibrosis postulated a production of collagen type III through activated mesangial cells (Nakamura et al., 1996). In our case, glomerular changes resulted in proteinuria and azotaemia (Hilbe et al., 2019) and did not give evidence for a correlation with the A. vasorum infection.",

            "text": "Inflammatory lung lesions near vessels and vascular thrombi with nematode sections within arterial vessels are comparable with observations made in dogs infected with A. vasorum. In such dogs, nematode sections of eggs and larval stages numerically strongly outrange sections of adult nematodes (Bourque et al., 2008; Schnyder et al., 2010). The same is valid for cats infected with A. abstrusus. In contrast, in the here analysed cat lung, only adult nematodes were observed, supporting the absence of stages that would lead to faecal larval excretion and therefore to patency. Furthermore, lung alterations were observed in a single area, that was observed by histology only and not at dissection. This explains the absence of evident radiological findings by thorax radiography. Infected dogs frequently show respiratory signs and/or abnormal thorax imaging (Dennler et al., 2011; Koch and Willesen, 2009), which was not present in this case. However, this might be not surprising as also cats severely affected by feline lungworms do not necessarily show clinical signs (Crisi et al., 2016; Schnyder et al., 2014a). Interestingly, in cats experimentally infected with A. vasorum the respiratory signs occurred as early as 2\u20133 weeks after infection, with potentially deadly outcome after five weeks, while other cats remained asymptomatic or presented with mild signs such as transient coughing and tachypnoe (Guilhon and Cens, 1970). The onset of obvious respiratory signs in cats infected with A. vasorum is therefore not predictable or may be even absent; this, together with the potential occurrence of other clinical manifestations in organs unrelated to the cardiopulmonary system, renders the identification of cats infected with A. vasorum highly challenging.",
