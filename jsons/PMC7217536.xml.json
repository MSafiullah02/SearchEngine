A node fails (si=1) whenever its load exceeds its threshold, \u03b8i\u2265\u03bbi(t). The load \u03bbi(t) can change over time, is measured in discrete time steps, t=0,...,T, and is dependent on the interaction between nodes. Usually, an interaction is defined by a form of load distribution. A failing node sends load to nodes it is connected with (i.e., its network neighbors). The number of these neighbors is called the degree of the node. The load distribution can cause further node failures and kick off a failure cascade that spans a considerable share of the whole network. A robust network is considered to be less prone to large cascades that start from a few initial failures.",

Such correlations are empirically grounded, e.g., well connected banks have the tendency of lower equity than less connected banks [10,18], even though the opposite is expected to lead to more robust systems [19,20]. Some models already assume that a threshold depends explicitly on the node degree [17,21,22] or on degree-related centrality measures. Also the study of random or targeted attacks on networks can be described by our approach, as the allocation of a threshold that is smaller than the initial load \u03b8\u2264\u03bb0 implies the initial failure of the node with this threshold and can also be interpreted as an attack of this node. In this well studied context, it is important to note that, dependent on the specific network, attack strategies based on centrality measures can be more effective than attacks based on node degrees [23].",

Thus, the main node variables of interest are node degrees and thresholds. The study of these ensembles has the advantage that ensemble averages of interesting quantities can be derived by analytic iterative approaches, so called local tree approximations (LTAs) or heterogeneous mean field approximations (HMFs). They become exact in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size N\u2192\u221e (where N is the number of nodes in the network). These approximations have been extended to capture degree-degree correlations. Yet, surprisingly, the equally fundamental correlations between degrees and thresholds have not been studied analytically. Only one specific case, i.e., the removal of nodes with higher degrees, has been studied for percolation [26,27]. Other investigations of deterministic attacks so far rely on simulations [19,22]. Imposing correlations includes the ranking of nodes and this leads to order statistics that are difficult to capture analytically. In this work, we show that for infinitely large networks the ranks simplify significantly and we can identify them by a transformation of the respective cumulative distribution function (cdf).",

Correspondingly, N thresholds are drawn independently from an arbitrary threshold distribution with cdf \u03a6(\u03b8) and ordered \u03b81/N\u2264\u03b82/N\u2264\u22ef\u2264\u03b8N/N. Each node in the network receives exactly one degree and one threshold. A specific allocation or attack strategy a defines this assignment. It thus decides which nodes are prone to failure because of a small threshold. Formally, a is a bijective (Borel-measurable) function a:[0,1]\u2192[0,1] that assigns each degree rank i/N a threshold rank a(i/N). Thus, a node has degree ki/N and threshold \u03b8a(i/N). While a can be nonlinear in general, the two most common heuristics correspond to linear a. In the case of the identity a(x)=x, thresholds and degrees are perfectly positively correlated. Nodes with a higher degree receive higher thresholds and are less prone to failure, while peripheral nodes with a small degree are conjectured to fail. We call this threshold allocation the peripheral failures (pf) scheme. The choice a(x)=1\u2212x, on the other hand, means that degrees and thresholds are perfectly anticorrelated. Nodes with higher degrees receive lower thresholds and therefore are more prone to fail. Hence, this threshold allocation is focused on hubs and we refer to it as the central failures (cf) scheme.",

            "text": "As i/N counts the fraction of nodes in the network with degree k\u2264ki/N, it coincides with the value of the empirical cdf i/N=Femp(ki/N). In the case that several nodes have the same degree k, we assume that the index i belongs to the node with the highest index among the nodes with degree k. Thus, for N\u2192\u221e, a rank i/N converges to a value of the theoretical cdf F(x) [i/N\u2192F(x)] and, correspondingly, its threshold rank to a[F(x)], which belongs to a threshold \u03b8 with a[F(x)]=\u03a6(\u03b8). Hence, for F(x)\u2208]F(k\u22121),F(k)], a node equipped with the rank F(x) has degree k and threshold \u03a6\u22121{a[F(x)]}, where \u03a6\u22121 denotes the generalized inverse or quantile function of \u03a6. Accordingly, we can express the threshold cdf F\u0398(k)x of a node conditional on its degree k as\n(1)F\u0398(k)x=\u03a6|\u03a6\u22121{a(]F(k\u22121),F(k)])}p(k),where \u03a6|M denotes the restriction of \u03a6 to a set M, i.e., \u03a6|M(x)=\u03a6(x) for x\u2208M and \u03a6|M(x)=0 for x\u2209M. The initial threshold cdf \u03a6 is restricted to thresholds that belong to nodes that we can identify with the interval ]F(k\u22121),F(k)], i.e., the nodes with degree k. It is renormalized by p(k), the probability mass of the respective set of nodes. Based on this consideration, we can also compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between thresholds and degrees as\n(2)rs=12\u222b01x\u22121/2[a(x)\u2212a\u00af]dx\u222b01[a(x)\u2212a\u00af]2dx,where a\u00af=\u222b01a(x)dx is defined as the average of a with respect to a uniform distribution. As we would expect, rs=1 for peripheral failures and rs=\u22121 for central failures. Also the derivation of the conditional threshold distributions F\u0398(k)x becomes more intuitive for these two extreme cases.",

Thus, all nodes with degree k can be associated with the interval ]F(k\u22121),F(k)] (cyan color in Figs. 1 and 2). This way, we do not depict nodes, but fractions of nodes in the network or their probability mass when randomly sampling from all nodes in the network. Analogously, the bottom interval (in Fig. 1) corresponds to the ordered thresholds. For peripheral failures (Fig. 1), nodes with degree k are equipped with threshold values in the interval ]\u03a6\u22121[F(k)],\u03a6\u22121[F(k\u22121)]]. For central failures, we have ]\u03a6\u22121[1\u2212F(k\u22121)],\u03a6\u22121[1\u2212F(k)]]. Consequently, Eq.

Formally, this formula measures the overlap between the intervals ]F(k\u22121),F(k)] and ]0,\u03a6x], divided by the width ]F(k\u22121),F(k)]=p(k) to normalize the cdf. The same idea applies also to central failures, however, in this case the fraction of nodes are ordered decreasingly. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the position of nodes in the interval corresponds to the probability mass 1\u2212\u03a6(x). Thus, nodes with a threshold bigger or equal to x correspond to the interval [0,1\u2212\u03a6(x)], while nodes with threshold smaller than or equal to x belong to [1\u2212\u03a6(x),1]. To calculate the fraction of failed nodes with a threshold smaller than or equal to x within the fraction of nodes with degree k, we have to measure the overlap between the intervals [1\u2212\u03a6(x),1] and ]F(k\u22121),F(k)]:\n(4)F\u0398(cf)(k)(x)=]F(k\u22121),F(k)]\u2229]1\u2212\u03a6x,1]]F(k\u22121),F(k)]=F(k)\u2212maxF(k\u22121),1\u2212\u03a6xp(k)1F(k)>1\u2212\u03a6x(k).\n",

It is based on the idea that a node simply carries the fraction of its failed neighbors as load, i.e., \u03bbi(t+1)=ni(t)/ki, where ni(t) denotes the number of failed neighbors of node i at time t. Thus, the failure of hubs usually has devastating consequences, as it impacts many nodes. The cascade size can be reduced by protecting nodes with higher degree, by assigning them higher thresholds (pf) without changing the overall threshold distribution. For infinitely large (configuration model) random graph ensembles, the fraction of failed nodes can be expressed as\n(6)\u03c1(t)=\u2211kp(k)\u2211n=0kb(k,n,\u03c0(t))F\u0398(k)nk,where the failure probability of a neighbor \u03c0(t) at time t is given by\n(7)\u03c0(t)=\u2211kkp(k)z\u2211n=0k\u22121b(k\u22121,n,\u03c0(t\u22121))F\u0398(k)nkaccording to [12,29], where z=\u2211kp(k)k denotes the average degree and b(k,n,\u03c0)=(kn)\u03c0n(1\u2212\u03c0)k\u2212n.",

Hence, the load that single neighbors receive from a failing hub is rather small. Thus, the negative impact of failing hubs is counteracted. The local tree approximation for this model has been derived by Ref. [12] and is of the form of Eq. (5). The load \u03bb(t,k) that a node with degree k carries is a random variable that is given by a sum\n\u03bb(t,k)=\u2211i=1kLinb(t\u22121)of independent variables Linb(t\u22121) that represent the load that has been distributed by neighbors to the node under consideration before. Thus, the distribution of \u03bb(t,k) is given by the k-fold convolution of the distribution of Lnb(t\u22121) that can be calculated iteratively and is defined as\nP[Lnb(t)=0]=[1\u2212\u03c0(t)],P[Lnb(t)=1/d]=\u2211dp(d)dzP\u0398(d)\u2264\u2211i=1d\u22121Linb(t\u22121).for d>0. \u03c0(t\u22121) denotes again the failure probability of a neighbor and is given by\n\u03c0(t)=\u2211dP[Lnb(t)=1/d].A neighbor does not send any load if it has not failed with probability 1\u2212\u03c0(t).

Its load here is the sum \u2211i=1d\u22121Linb(t\u22121) of all the loads sent to it previously by its remaining neighbors. A more detailed explanation is given by Refs. [12,32].",

Yet, for ED and pf, \u03c1 can jump several times for small changes of \u03c3.
