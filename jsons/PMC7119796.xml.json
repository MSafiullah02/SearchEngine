In Denmark, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) plays a crucial role in the respiratory disease complex, leading to substantial losses within the calf rearing industry (Uttenthal et al., 1996). BRSV is a single-stranded RNA virus, which belongs to the genus Pneumovirus, classified in the subfamily Pneumovirinae in the family of Paramyxoviridae (Murphy et al., 1995). The virus is closely related to the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (Collins et al., 1996).",

            "text": "The gross lesions appear as large areas of consolidated tissue in the cranioventral parts of the lungs in which bronchi and bronchioli often are filled with mucopurulent exudate. Interstitial edema may be seen in all lobes, whereas emphysema typically is located in the diaphragmatic lobes (Kimman et al., 1989, Bryson, 1993). Microscopic findings consist of epithelial lesions in the bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli, which are filled or infiltrated with neutrophils and macrophages. Frequently, multinuclear syncytia as well as hyaline membranes can be found. Also, evidence of bronchiolar repair including epithelial hyperplasia and organisation of exudate are observed fairly early in the course of the infection (Kimman et al., 1989, Bryson, 1993). Immunostainings performed on lung tissue indicate that BRSV are located in the cranioventral lobes in most cases, and rarely in the caudal parts of the diaphragmatic lobes (Kimman et al., 1989, Ellis et al., 1996, Viuff et al., 1996). The similarity of the clinical signs and pathology appearing in BRSV-infected calves and HRSV-infected infants is noticeable (Baker, 1991). Hence, studies of BRSV-infections in calves also contribute valuable information to the disease in infants. Today, the available treatments and prophylactic precautions against the diseases are far from optimal. In fact, a vaccine against HRSV is still not available for children (Collins et al., 1996). Therefore, a great effort has been made to study the immune response and pathogenesis of the viral infection in ruminants (Kimman, 1993, Belknap et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Since lesions are present in areas of the lung where little or no virus is detected, one or several immunopathological mechanisms are assumed to be involved in the disease (Baker, 1991, Kimman, 1993). Moreover, the importance of different subpopulations of leukocytes in the lung during infection has been investigated (Kimman, 1993, Taylor et al., 1995). In particular, alveolar macrophages (AM), which phagocytise pathogens and secrete inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, have attracted attention. Human or murine AM infected with HRSV in vitro produce large amounts of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Panuska et al., 1990, Becker et al., 1991). Today, accumulating data from in vivo investigations indicate that TNF-\u03b1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. AM isolated from infants suffering from an acute RSV infection have been found to express TNF-\u03b1 protein in a cell-associated manner (Midulla et al., 1993). Moreover, Matsuda et al. (1995) demonstrated the presence of TNF-\u03b1 in the nasal discharge from HRSV-infected infants. In the murine HRSV-model, high levels of bioactive TNF-\u03b1 were found in the lungs and sera of HRSV-infected BALBc mice, post inoculation day (PID) 2 (Hayes et al., 1994). Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to possess an antiviral effect against HRSV in vitro (Cirino et al., 1993, Merolla et al., 1995) as well as in mice in vivo (Neuzil et al., 1996). Therefore, the cytokine may also be involved in the immune defense directed against the RSV infection.",

Lung lavages performed on two animals on PID 8 contained 3.7 and 10.5 ng/ml, respectively. In general, calves which had high levels of BRSV-antigens in the lung tissue had a fairly large amount of TNF-\u03b1 in the lung wash. Extremely high TNF-\u03b1 values were measured in two calves on PID 7. P. multocida was isolated in one of these cases. In contrast, TNF-\u03b1 was only found in a small amount (1.0 ng/ml) in one mock-inoculated animal on PID 4 and could not be detected in the remaining uninfected control calves.",

In agreement with what Hayes et al.

The cytokine has also been shown to be involved in the mechanisms leading to increased permeability of endothelium (Zeck-Kapp et al., 1990) and epithelium in lung inflammations (Li et al., 1995). Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to inhibit the alveolar type II epithelial cells production of surfactant phospholipid (Arias-Diaz et al., 1993) and surfactant proteins (Wispe et al., 1990, Pryhuber et al., 1996), a mechanism which has been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Arias-Diaz et al., 1993). Therefore, the biological effects induced by TNF-\u03b1 could explain the presence of purulent exudate, edema and atelectasis in the BRSV-infected lung. Hence, we suggest that the high levels of TNF-\u03b1 measured on PID 6\u20137 contribute to the severe lung lesions and clinical signs accompanying BRSV infection on PID 6\u20138.",

This might be explained by the fact that TNF-\u03b1 also appears in a cell-associated manner, partly because the cytokine binds to cells via its receptors (Ohmann et al., 1990), and also because TNF-\u03b1 exists on the cell surface as a membrane-associated form (Nii et al., 1993). Compared to other bovine studies (Yoo et al., 1995), relatively high amounts of TNF-\u03b1 were detected in the BAL fluids in this study, possibly because cell-associated TNF-\u03b1 was included, since the BAL-cells were not separated from the lung wash suspensions before they were frozen.",

This mechanism might play an important role in the RSV-infection since in vitro studies have shown that the TNF-receptor p55 is secreted in large amounts from lung epithelia cells infected with HRSV (Arnold et al., 1994). Interestingly, a homology was recently discovered between a conserved region in the G-protein of RSV and a domain within the TNF-receptor p55 (Langedijk et al., 1998). Therefore, one could speculate that RSV has evolved mechanisms by which it is able to interact with TNF-\u03b1, and thereby inhibit the antiviral effect of the cytokine. This interference may eventually result in the dramatic levels of TNF-\u03b1 found in the lung.",

Intrapulmonary administration of recombinant bovine TNF-\u03b1 or monoclonal antibodies against TNF-\u03b1 or its receptors, is one way to continue these studies in calves.
