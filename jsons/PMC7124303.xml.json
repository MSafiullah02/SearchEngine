The genus Marburgvirus consists of one species, Marburg marburgvirus, which has two distinct viruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV). In contrast, the genus Ebolavirus consists of five distinct species, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, and Reston ebolavirus, represented by Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus, Ta\u00ef forest virus, Bundibugyo virus, and Reston virus (RESTV), respectively [1]. A novel filovirus named Lloviu virus (LLOV), which belongs to the genus Cuevavirus, was recently detected from dead bats in Spain [2], [3]. Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers have occurred mainly in Africa [4], [5]. Infection causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates with high mortality rates of up to 90%. It has been shown that other animals such as pigs and fruit bats are also susceptible to these viruses [6], [7], [8], suggesting a broader host range than thus far assumed.",

The expression pattern of receptors/coreceptors is believed to be one of the major factors determining the host range and tissue tropism of filoviruses [9]. While several cellular molecules have been proposed to be filovirus receptors or coreceptors (i.e., attachment or fusion factors), the molecular mechanisms underlying filovirus entry into cells are not fully understood. Human T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) is known to contribute to filovirus entry through the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) exposed on the virus envelope and facilitates viral attachment and virus uptake independently of GP [10], [11], [12]. The IgV domain, which forms a PtdSer-binding pocket, is thought to recognize PtdSer on viral envelopes and facilitate the binding of virus particles to cell surfaces [10], [12], [13], suggesting that the IgV domain is essential for the TIM-1-mediated enhancement of viral infection.",

Though a TIM-1 knockdown experiment has demonstrated that Vero cell-derived TIM-1 largely contributes to efficient filovirus entry into cells [11], information on other African green monkey cell lines such as COS-1 and BSC-1, which are also used for analysis of filovirus infection, is limited [14], [15], [16]. In this study, we found that Vero E6 TIM-1 had different primary structures and a greater ability to promote infectivity of vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with filovirus GPs than TIM-1s derived from the other cell lines tested. Interestingly, the increased ability of Vero E6 TIM-1 is most likely due to a single amino acid difference at amino acid position 48. Our results suggest that a polymorphism of the TIM-1 molecules is one of the factors that influence the cell susceptibility to filovirus infection.",

A neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the VSV G protein, VSV-G(N)1-9 [17], was used to abolish the background infectivity of parental VSV\u0394G-G. Viral infectious units used to calculate the multiplicity of infection (MOI) were determined by counting the number of cells expressing GFP. For quantitative comparison of the infectivity in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and those expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant TIM-1s, the luciferase activity in infected cell lysates was measured using a Luciferase assay kit (Promega). The relative luciferase activity was determined by setting the value of infected control (i.e., empty vector-transduced) cells to 1.0. 293T, 293T-derived Platinum-GP (Plat-GP) (Cell Biolabs) [18], and African green monkey kidney cell lines (Vero E6, COS-1, and BSC-1) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fatal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin.",

To clarify whether the IgV domain and/or cytoplasmic tail of Vero E6 TIM-1 were involved in the ability to promote of infectivity of VSV\u0394G-EBOV GP, we constructed TIM-1-deletion mutants lacking the IgV domain (\u0394IgV) or cytoplasmic tail (\u0394CT) and examined the viral infectivity in 293T cells expressing these TIM-1 mutants (Fig. 2A and B). As expected, with deletion of the IgV domain, TIM-1 completely lost its ability to promote the infectivity of VSV\u0394G-EBOV GP. Interestingly, \u0394CT enhanced the viral infectivity but its efficiency was reduced compared to WT TIM-1. Expression levels of these TIM-1s on the cell surface were quantified with MFI values obtained by flow cytometry and found to be similar (Fig. 2C and D).

Since it was recently reported that the length of the mucin domain of TIM proteins regulates their ability to promote virus entry [26], the polymorphism in the mucin domain might regulate the function of TIM via a mechanism dependent on the length of the mucin domain. Other polymorphisms at N48 and K108 in the IgV region of TIM-1 were also found (Fig. 1B) [23]. K108 has been shown to be responsible for the binding of anti-TIM-1 monoclonal antibody 190/4, which blocks hepatitis A virus infection, suggesting that K108 might be associated with the virus-recognition of TIM-1 [23].

Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the human TIM-1 IgV gene identified some important amino acid residues for TIM-1-mediated viral infection [10]: F55, R106, G111, N114, and D115 located on the CC\u2019 loop (44-64 aa) and FG loop (101-125 aa), which form the PtdSer-binding pocket. The crystal structure of the human TIM-1 IgV domain, predicted based on that of mouse TIM-1 using PHYRE2 (protein homology/analogy recognition engine 2) [10], revealed that the structure of the PtdSer-binding pocket was conserved between human and mouse TIM-1s. We also predicted the crystal structures of the TIM-1 IgV domains of Vero E6 and COS-1 using the same approach and found that amino acids N48 and H48 were positioned on the edge of the CC\u2019 loop in the PtdSer-binding pocket (data not shown), suggesting that the amino acid substitution focused on in the present study might regulate the function of TIM-1 by affecting the formation of the PtdSer-binding pocket. Interestingly, however, we found that virus-like particles (VLPs) attached to 293T cells expressing Vero E6 TIM-1 less efficiently than cells expressing COS-1 TIM-1 (data not shown), suggesting that the IgV domain including the amino acid at position 48 might be involved in not only viral attachment but also subsequent entry steps (e.g., viral internalization and membrane fusion).",

In this study, decreased ability to promote virus infectivity was observed in TIM-1 lacking its cytoplasmic tail, suggesting the involvement of the TIM-1 cytoplasmic tail in promoting virus entry, most likely through intracellular signaling pathways. The TIM-1 cytoplasmic tail has at least one tyrosine phosphorylation site that could potentiate the intracellular signaling regulating immune responses [19], [20], [21]. In addition, it has previously been reported that the TIM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in its cytoplasmic tail activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [28] that is responsible for macropinocytosis [29], [30]. Considering these findings together, we hypothesize that TIM-1-induced signaling may partially contribute to enhanced viral uptake by macropinocytosis.",

Among these cells, kidney epithelial cells such as Vero E6 cells are highly susceptible to filovirus infection [11], but lymphocytes are resistant to filovirus infection although they express TIM-1 [15], indicating that TIM-1 expression alone is not sufficient to confer susceptibility to filovirus infection. Furthermore, although ectopic expression of TIM-1 dramatically promoted filovirus GP-mediated entry into cells (Fig. 3D and E) [10], [11], [12], filoviruses infect macrophages and dendritic cells, which have low or undetectable expression of TIM-1 [33], suggesting that TIM-1 is not essential for filovirus infection. However, since filovirus antigens are detected in many organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, and lungs at the late stage of infection [34], it is conceivable that TIM-1 polymorphism might affect overall disease progression in filovirus-infected individuals.",

For example, TIM-1 enhances filovirus, alphavirus, flavivirus, and arenavirus infections but not Lassa virus, herpes simplex virus 1, influenza A virus (H7N1), and SARS coronavirus infections [10], [12], [27]. Interestingly, we found that the infectivities of VSV\u0394G-MARV GP and -RAVV GP were enhanced less efficiently by TIM-1 expression compared to VSV\u0394G-EBOV GP. These findings suggest that there might be viral glycoprotein-dependent mechanisms underlying TIM-1-mediated viral entry. Thus, further studies are needed to fully understand the contribution of TIM-1 to the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of enveloped viruses.",
