Depending on the country, lockdown measures may include mandatory geographic quarantines, shelter-in-place requirements (except to buy food and access vital health services), closing certain types of businesses, or banning events and gatherings [9]. These social controls can hinder or delay PLWH\u2019s access to HIV care and support at hospital or clinic sites. For instance, a study conducted in China found that 32.6% of PLWHs were at risk of discontinuing ART and about 48.6% did not know where to get needed medications due to COVID-19 lockdown measures [4]. In SSA, the effect of travel restrictions on PLWHs could be even more detrimental given the long distances they must often travel to access treatment and care due to the limited availability of specialized HIV services, preferences for higher-tiered facilities, and efforts to mitigate social stigma surrounding treatment [10, 11].",

For instance, in Liberia during the Ebola crisis, rice prices increased by more than 30% and cassava prices rose to 150%; in China, food prices have increased by 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic [21]. In Tanzania, PLWHs who rely on periodic farming and cultivation jobs are breaking social distancing requirements to earn money for food, putting this immunocompromised population at even greater risk of COVID-19 infection [19]. To reduce food insecurity, some SSA countries (e.g., Rwanda, Uganda and Nigeria) have combined restrictive measures with food distribution services for vulnerable communities. However, some of these distribution services may not adhere to social distancing guidelines. In fact, in many SSA countries, vulnerable communities congregate at food distribution centers, increasing their risk of acquiring and spreading COVID-19.",

Two-way text messaging allows people in different locations to easily check on each other, converse, and provide psychosocial support without requiring travel or physical gathering.
