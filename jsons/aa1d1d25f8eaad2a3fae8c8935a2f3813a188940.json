This novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. 1 Since initial detection of the virus, more than 1,800,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, and over 400,000 persons have recovered. The first case in Israel was reported on February 27, 2020. To date, over 13,500 have been diagnosed and more than 4,000 have recovered. 2 Initially, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Israel, all persons who tested positive were admitted to hospitals. Nowadays all those with mild disease are isolated in designated hotels, whereas those with moderate and severe disease are admitted to designated internal medicine or intensive care unit departments within hospitals. The criterion for discharge from isolation is two consecutive negative tests of (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection. One difficulty faced by clinicians, as well as by patients, is the unknown time-frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patients.",

Stratifying our population by median age (above and below 44 years), the time to full recovery was shorter for the younger than the older patients: 17\u00b70 vs. 17\u00b73 days. The time to negative detection of each gene was also shorter among the younger than the older patients, for example 14\u00b74 vs 16\u00b77 days, p=0.08, for gene E. Elevated body temperature presented in 78% (7/9) of the older patients, and 54% (6/11) of the younger patients. Figure 1a describes the time (in days) until a complete negative result (negative detection of all three genes), according to patient sex. Although older, the women exhibited a shorter time to recovery than did the men (16\u00b77 vs. 17\u00b75 days p=0.6). We further examined the time from admission until negative detection of each gene. Figure 1b shows the time to recovery in all three detected genes by hospitalization day, from the first day of symptoms. All genes E, RdRp and N correlated with the sum of days leading to discharge; the strongest correlation was for gene N (r=0.78, r=0.82. r=1.0, respectively, p<0.001 for all). The time to recovery was longer for patients with hypertension or lung disease. Compared to those without hypertension, for those with hypertension (n=6), the number of days to recovery was 18\u00b75 vs. 16\u00b76, p=0.13; and for each of the genes E, RdRp, and N: 17\u00b78 vs. 14\u00b74, p=0.03; 17\u00b77 vs. 14\u00b79, p=0.05; and 18\u00b75 vs. 16\u00b76, p=0.13, respectively. In patients with no chronic illnesses at the time of admission (n=11), negative detections of gene E and RdRP were after 14\u00b75 and 14\u00b79 days, respectively. This contrasts to 16\u00b74 and 16\u00b77 days, respectively, for those with comorbidities upon admission. Full recovery was determined in those without comorbidities after 17\u00b70 days, when gene N was also not detected, and for those with comorbidities after 17\u00b74 days.",

Recovery was defined as two negative measurements for all three genes. Here we describe the days to recovery from the first day of appearance of symptoms.
