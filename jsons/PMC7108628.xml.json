Coronaviruses are associated with a variety of enteric and respiratory disease syndromes in several animal species. The two recognized human coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV, OC 43, and 229 E, have definitively been associated only with upper respiratory illness. SARS-CoV was first cultured in Vero E6 cells from autopsy tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasal swab samples obtained from patients hospitalized in Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, and Singapore, with identification by electron microscopy and complete genomic sequencing. The aetiological role of SARS-CoV was confirmed by the replication of an illness similar to that seen among humans in experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques, followed by re-isolation of the virus and detection of a specific immune response in the infected macaques.13,14 The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV is quite distinct from that of other human and animal coronaviruses,15,16 suggesting that the virus has likely circulated in its natural reservoir for a considerable period of time.\n",

Health care facilities were severely affected and transmission in hospitals was a major factor in the amplification of outbreaks.

For example, of 74 cases reported from 15 April to 9 June in Toronto, Canada, 39% occurred among health care workers, 38% resulted from exposure during hospitalization, and 23% occurred among hospital visitors.47 After health care facilities, households of SARS patients were the second most common setting of SARS-CoV transmission. Surveys in Hong Kong and Singapore indicated that 6\u20138% of people in the households of SARS patients may have been secondarily infected.48,49 The risk of transmission was greatest among those involved in direct patient care or other close contact with the patient.
