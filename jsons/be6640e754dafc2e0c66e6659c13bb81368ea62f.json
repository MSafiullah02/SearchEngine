For example, the UK government introduced its most stringent measures to control transmission of COVID-19 on March 23, 2020. However, prior to this date several important steps had been advocated and followed including avoidance of travel to work, voluntary self-isolation of symptomatic individuals and a reduction in public gathering. Analysis of COVID-19 data from London may elucidate the extent to which the early measures were effective in slowing the local pandemic.",

Following transmission, symptoms of COVID-19 may develop after an incubation period of 4-5 days. 3,4 The median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation is 11 (IQR 8-14) days. 5 Therefore, it can be estimated that the time interval from transmission to hospitalisation for the majority of patients is 12-19 days. Our data indicate that the peak in new admissions occurred only 8 days after the formal 'lockdown' within the UK, and that the deceleration and subsequent decline in new admissions to KCH occurred before the effect of the formal 'lockdown' could have had its full impact. Moreover, our data suggest that the early measures to reduce transmission had a major beneficial impact on the COVID-19 epidemic in South London.",
