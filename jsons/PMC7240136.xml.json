Therefore, we still need to be vigilant against this disease. We counted the number of days from the first symptom to death of 40 cases. The median survival time (in days) from onset to death was 13, the same as reported by Wang et al.18 Also, using single-factor analysis, we found that age was the key factor. Our study demonstrated that the time from the first symptom to death in the elderly (age > 65 y) was shorter than that of younger people (age \u2264 65 y), which is similar to that reported for MERS and SARS.27,28 On the other hand, other studies of patients with MERS found that patients with certain chronic diseases were more likely to die.21-23 However, our single-factor study did not find that these factors had statistical significance for the time. It may be that the sample size was too small. We suspect that people with these chronic diseases are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, but not to die. It also indirectly proves that this disease has a widespread, high infection rate, but low mortality compared with MERS and SARS. All in all, in the outbreak of COVID-19, we should pay attention to the health management and protection of the elderly.",
