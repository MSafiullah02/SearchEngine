While low levels of mortality are observed during outbreaks, the overall impact is typically measured in terms of economic losses and disruption to services; for example, foodborne norovirus infections are estimated to result in a loss of US$2 billion per annum [2]. The recent introduction of a vaccine for rotavirus has significantly reduced pediatric gastroenteritis levels in the USA, causing noroviruses to now become the leading cause of pediatric gastroenteritis. While typically an acute disease, norovirus infection often leads to long-term infection in immunocompromised patients and it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population [3,4].",

This is at least partly due to better surveillance mechanisms, improving our understanding of the disease burden, but also due to the availability of assays to study the development of the immune response and the efficacy of small molecule inhibitors. While the efficient culture of human noroviruses (HuNoVs) in immortalized cells has yet to be achieved [5], the development of a norovirus replicon [6], which allows the generation of cell lines stably replicating Norwalk virus RNA, has facilitated many small molecule inhibitors to be tested in vitro. The discovery of murine norovirus (MNV) [7], which replicates efficiently in immortalized macrophage cells and has both reverse genetics systems and small animal models available [8], has also enabled the examination of the immune responses to noroviruses as well as the efficacy of inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.",

Simple mechanical removal of the virus through adherence to proper hand washing techniques appears most effective with the additional incorporation of alcohol-based sanitizers into a hand washing protocol offering minor improvements [14].",

Studies investigating different cleaning regimens for hospitals have shown that detergent-based cleaning is ineffective alone; however, combined detergent and bleach may be effective.

The recent establishment of a receptor-blocking assay whereby the ability of antisera to prevent the interaction of recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) with soluble HBGA is examined and has proven to be a suitable alternative to an in vitro neutralization assay [22]. Norovirus vaccine development has also been limited by the fact that the immune response to HuNoVs is not well understood [23]. For instance, infection in volunteers with Norwalk virus resulted in a lack of long-term protection against reinfection, suggesting that the immune system is unable to generate a durable response. In addition, given the substantial norovirus strain diversity, it may be difficult to generate a broadly crossreactive vaccine capable of protecting against all norovirus strains. The cost of vaccine development for HuNoV is high, although a recent study has indicated that it would result in substantial cost savings, \u2264US$2.1 million over 4 years [24].",

High levels of specific IgA antibodies against HuNoV were detected, further supporting this route of inoculation to induce a robust mucosal protection. The advantages of an approach based on intranasal delivery are its ease of administration and the stimulation of mucosal dendritic cells facilitating a local immune response [27]. In fact, a strong mucosal IgA response in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts has been associated to increased protection against HuNoV [28]. Studies involving an intramuscular route of vaccination in chimpanzees have also provided positive results for norovirus vaccination. Animals inoculated with Norwalk virus VLPs (GI), were protected against subsequent challenge with Norwalk virus, while animals vaccinated with VLPs from a GII norovirus were not [29]. These results highlight the need for the development of efficient bivalent and broadly cross-reactive vaccines.",

            "text": "HuNoV interacts with HBGAs and, although binding to HBGA is not sufficient to enter cultured cells, it is thought that this interaction is critical for virus internalization and subsequent infection [9,19]. HBGAs are complex carbo hydrate molecules present in the surface of red blood cells, mucosal epithelia and also in different body fluids (i.e., milk and saliva). HuNoV capsids interact with different families of HBGAs including ABO, secretor and \u03b12,3-sialylated carbohydrates of the type 2 chain (e.g., sialyl-Lewis X). Individuals harboring a single polymorphism in the FUT2 gene are less susceptible to HuNoV infection, further supporting the hypothesis that HBGAs are the receptor molecules for HuNoV [9,19]. The FUT2 gene encodes for a \u03b11,2-fucosyl transferase that catalyzes the fucosylation of HBGAs and is responsible for the secretor blood type [19]. Nonsecretor individuals present a polymorphism in the FUT2 gene resulting in an enzyme unable to fucosylate H-type backbones in HBGAs. Although the interaction with HBGA is required for virus entry, it is thought that other cellular cofactors are required as overexpression of FUT2 does not rescue infectivity in cells that are competent for HuNoV replication [30]. Recent investigations suggest that HuNoV binding to cells and internalization in vivo can also occur independently of HBGA, suggesting the participation of other receptor molecules [31]. In particular, it has been demonstrated that HuNoV capsids interact with heparan sulphate, a cell membrane glycosaminoglycan, which might have a role in cell entry [32]. By contrast, MNV uses the ganglioside GD1a as an attachment ligand for infection of permissive cells, although the relevance of this molecule for HuNoV has yet to be determined [33].",

These include NS7pol, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for viral RNA synthesis, as well as NS6pro, the viral protease that catalyzes the proteolytic processing of ORF1. Translation of structural proteins VP1 (ORF2) and VP2 (ORF3) occurs from a subgenomic RNA produced during virus replication (Figure 2). The process of viral protein translation in noroviruses relies on the recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors to the virus encoded VPg protein (NS5) covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA. A specific interaction between VPg and eIF3 and/or eIF4E has been demonstrated and may contribute to viral translation initiation [36,37].",

Viral replication takes place adjacent to the microtubule organizing center, and utilizes microtubules to position the replication complex, as their chemical disruption reduces viral replication [40].

Standard screening studies involving >5000 synthetic small molecules and enzyme immune assay have also been applied successfully with 14 different compounds identified to effectively inhibit HuNoV capsid binding to at least one of the members of the HBGA ABO family [43]. Since HuNoV capsid binds heparan sulphate, another possible field of investigation would be the use of heparan sulphate analogs such as heparin, suramin and other heparan derivatives [32].

The use of specific drugs aimed to disrupt these interfaces could provide an attractive antiviral therapy. HuNoV VPg is known to interact with eIF3 and components of the eIF4F complex, thus a possible approach would consist of targeting either of these interactions with small molecules that disrupt their interaction with the norovirus VPg protein but not host cell factors. Hippuristanol is an encouraging example of the existence of drugs that specifically affect virus translation with lower toxicity for the cell. It is a marine compound identified during the screening of a panel of small molecules with affinity for the C-terminus of eIF4A. Hippuristanol inhibits translation of both MNV and feline calicivirus (FCV) and appears to be less toxic for cells than for the virus [44]. Hippuristanol has been recently used to control tumor growth in mice, supporting its use in vivo [45]. Other approaches targeting translation initiation include the development of drugs against host factor interacting surfaces in VPg that could now be facilitated by the recent description of MNV and FCV VPg protein structures [46].",

Peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) directed against the first AUG region in norovirus ORF1 gene are effective in inhibiting HuNoV and MNV replication in cell culture [49]. PMOs are similar to DNA oligonucleotides, but they are soluble in water and highly resistant to degradation making them suitable for treatments in vivo. The use of siRNA molecules to target replication is more efficient than PPMOs; PPMOs and siRNAs targeting the equivalent genomic sequence in FCV showed that siRNA elicited inhibition 50-fold larger than PPMOs [50].

Preceding the initiation of viral RNA replication, VPg must be guanylated in a step carried out by the virus polymerase NS7pol or its precursor NS6\u2013NS7 [55]. This guanylated-VPg product is then used as a primer for viral RNA synthesis. Accordingly, it may be possible to design specific nucleoside analogs to compete with GTP to inhibit VPg-nucleotydylylation, or to be incorporated but prevent the subsequent elongation of viral RNA synthesis. For example, in picornaviruses, 5-fluorouracil triphosphate functions as an inhibitor of VPg-primed RNA synthesis [56]. The 5-fluorouracil triphosphate is bound to VPg with higher affinity than uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate, the natural nucleotide typically incorporated, and this binding inhibits the formation of long VPg-primed RNA polymers, suggesting that its antiviral activity is partly due to the blocking of viral RNA synthesis initiation [56].",

Several nucleoside compounds have activity against noroviruses in cell culture, opening up their possible application as therapeutic compounds. RBV, a purine analog that has been found to possess antiviral activity against a vast number of different viruses [57], also works against HuNoV and MNV in cell culture [52]. RBV is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes into RBV mono-, di- and tri-phosphate and exerts its broad antiviral effect through various mechanisms: competitive inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which reduces the intracellular concentrations of guanine nucleotides; inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases; inhibition of mRNA cap formation; enhancement of antiviral immune responses; and lethal mutagenesis of viral quasi species as a result of incorporation of RBV monophosphate into viral RNA (reviewed in [57]). For MNV and the novovirus replicon, RBV antiviral activity is associated with a decrease in GTP levels since the complementation with GTP reduces its antiviral activity. Mycophenolic acid, a non-nucleoside inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, also affects norovirus replication further supporting that norovirus is affected by imbalances in the NTP pools. There is no evidence however, for increased mutation frequencies in noro virus genomes after RBV treatment, suggesting it does not elicit antiviral activity through lethal mutagenesis [52].",

Enzymatic assays have confirmed that suramin and NF023 are inhibitors of HuNoV and MNV RdRps, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Importantly, suramin is a drug currently used in the clinical treatment of sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma [65]. In addition to its capacity to inhibit viral RNA replication, suramin has been found to inhibit HuNoV capsid binding to heparan sulphate [32]. The styrylchromones are a new class of flavonoid compounds found to elicit antiviral activities against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including MNV [66]. Evidence indicates that they might be targeting the viral RdRp, although the precise mechanism of action is not yet known.",

            "text": "The untranslated regions in RNA virus genomes normally recruit multiple host factors to the viral RNA genome that play important roles in viral translation and replication. In noroviruses the untranslated regions are extremely short but the coding and noncoding regions in genomic and subgenomic RNA are known to fold into highly-ordered secondary structures that interact with multiple host factors including proteins La, PTB, PCBP, DDX3 and various hnRNPs among others [70,71]. Although the precise role of these proteins in the norovirus life cycle is yet to be determined, they are probably involved in viral RNA replication and genome circularization, a process that is thought to be required for many RNA viruses [72]. So far, no antinorovirus strategies have been investigated based on targeting these proteins, but as small molecule inhibitors exist for some of them, further studies in this area are warranted. For example, the identification of small inhibitory molecules targeting DDX3 has opened the possibility of targeting norovirus infections in vivo as specific downregulation of DDX3 protein levels in cells results in the inhibition of MNV [71]. Supporting this possibility, DDX3 inhibitors have shown antiviral activity against HIV in cell culture [73]. DDX3 is a multifunctional host cell RNA helicase implicated in the life cycle of a number of viruses [74]. DDX3 contributes to the innate immune response, but also to host cell translation initiation via interaction with eIF4F and eIF3 [75].",

As with all therapies targeting intestinal pathogens, there is a significant problem associated with the delivery of the inhibitor to the site of replication, as well as stability in this rather harsh environment. Subsequently, there are a number of significant hurdles that must be overcome for the use of these inhibitors in a clinical setting. An area that has yet to be fully explored is the use of inhibitors that are currently in clinical use for other RNA viruses. RBV is widely used for the treatment of viral infections and has been shown to be effective in cell culture against HuNoV, yet clinical use in the treatment of chronic norovirus infections has yet to be described. Given the conserved nature of RNA synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase provides a particularly attractive target as numerous nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors are under trial for other RNA viruses such as HCV.

The development of an in vitro culture system and an animal model that recapitulates all aspects of the disease observed in humans would prove invaluable and should remain a high priority. A better understanding of the correlates of protection would also enable better vaccine design and could lead to the generation of a broadly protective vaccine that may at least produce short-term immunity in particularly vulnerable or regularly exposed individuals.

VPg covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome recruits different HFs, including components of eIF3 and eIF4F, required for cap-independent protein translation, permitting the expression of ORF1. ORF1 is proteolytically cleaved by the viral protease NS6pro (and its precursors). Mature nonstructural proteins released after proteolysis promote the replication of the viral RNA; VPg acts as primer of viral RNA synthesis, remaining covalently attached to the viral genome after replication; the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS7pol catalyze the synthesis of viral RNA in a process assisted by the helicase-homologous viral NTPase (NS3). The binding of several host factors (HFs) such as La protein, DDX3, hnRNP A1 and PTB to the viral genome is critical for the efficient virus replication. The replication of a subgenomic RNA leads to the generation of shorter viral RNA products that are translated in the major and minor capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 (ORF2 and ORF3, respectively). Newly synthesized genomes are encapsidated in mature particles that are released into the extracellular environment.

For the modelling of the full norovirus capsid, the program Protein Workshop and the structure available for Norwalk virus (PDB: 1IHM) has been used.
