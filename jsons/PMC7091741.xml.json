Some patients were linked to a seafood market, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but, soon, human-to-human transmission was confirmed. The pathogen was promptly identified as a novel coronavirus belonging to lineage B betacoronaviruses that also include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a pandemic in China in 2002/2003, and bat SARS-like coronaviruses.1",

The estimated case fatality rate is about 2%, which is much lower than that of SARS (9.6%), while its transmission rate (R0) is 2\u20133% (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus), similar to that of SARS (3%). Like SARS-CoV-infected individuals, patients infected with this novel betacoronavirus showed abnormal findings on chest computed tomography, along with common symptoms that include fever, cough, and myalgia, or fatigue, at the onset of illness. Still, all indications suggest that the acute respiratory syndrome of SARS is, so far, more severe than that manifested by the present pneumonia outbreak.2",

Therefore, we suggest renaming NCIP as \u201cpneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)\u201d and 2019-nCoV as \u201cPARS coronavirus (PARS-CoV)\u201d, similar to SARS-CoV, to retain equivalent terminology.",
