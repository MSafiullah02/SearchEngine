All data were from the mainland of China in 2003. The criteria for SARS diagnosis were consistent with the criteria for diagnosing infectious atypical pneumonia from the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. The histories of close contacts and possible factors influencing the incubation period, including age, gender, occupation, affected area, and contact pattern, were investigated through telephone interviews. All interviews were tape recorded and checked by quality control staff to monitor the quality of the interview data. Of the 220 probable SARS cases, 11 cases (5 percent) were excluded from the present study for no reliable exposure information, and 209 cases (95 percent) were included. There were no significant differences in age and gender between the excluded and the included cases.",

Different places of exposure had different risks of SARS-associated coronavirus transmission (14). Health-care facilities were severely affected, and transmission in hospitals was a major factor in the amplification of the outbreaks. In addition to health-care workers, other patients in the same ward or on the same floor with SARS patients and visitors to the hospital were affected. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy) may be associated with an increased risk of transmission in health-care settings (14). After health-care facilities, households of SARS patients were the second most common setting of SARS-associated coronavirus transmission. An increased risk among household members of SARS patients had been shown in those with close prolonged contact with the index patient, especially in those who shared a bed, were close in proximity (within 1 m) to the patient, and dined together (15). Thus, a spouse had a higher risk of acquiring SARS. Transmission to casual and social contacts appeared to be uncommon (14).",

In addition, in many cases, the difficulties posed by \u201cincomplete\u201d data due to multiple contact dates led to researchers' presenting descriptive summary statistics without further analysis. In the present study, a nonparametric method was used to enable the inclusion of probable SARS cases with multiple contact dates, and the sample size was over 200, which agreed with the recommendation of the World Health Organization (7).

However, the maximum incubation period of SARS was less clear (13), with a number of reports of incubation periods exceeding the World Health Organization's maximum incubation period of 10 days (7, 21). Our results showed that, with a probability of 0.8, 90 percent of patients would experience the onset of symptoms within 11.58 days of infection and that, with a probability of 0.9, 99 percent of patients would experience the onset of symptoms within 22.22 days of infection. These findings suggested that the duration of quarantine might need to be reconsidered to better the practice of public health. At the beginning and the end of a SARS epidemic, to control the epidemic completely, we recommend a period of 22 days for quarantine, which would capture 99 percent of all probable SARS cases with a probability of 0.9. To some extent, such a modification of quarantine policy would increase the resources expended for quarantine. However, because the SARS patients and their close contacts are very small in number at the beginning and the end of a SARS epidemic, this effect should be minimal. During the middle stage of a SARS epidemic, because the SARS patients and their close contacts are very numerous, any extension of the maximum incubation period would have a considerable impact on health service practice and resources. \u201c\u2026, many now say that isolating even a small percentage of those who have been exposed to the illness\u2014but who are not yet ill\u2014could help quell an outbreak\u201d (22, p. 1441). Therefore, a period of 12 days is enough for quarantine, which would capture over 90 percent of all probable SARS cases with a probability of 0.8 and reduce the resources expended for quarantine, including the time that adults spend in quarantine.",

Thus, the contact pattern's having no significant effect on the SARS incubation period suggested that the route of infection and the dose of the invading organism might not be relevant to the SARS incubation period. Clinically, SARS patients tend to go downhill after a period of apparent initial recovery. Once their immune system kicks in, they begin to recover, but then they deteriorate rapidly (23). Therefore, SARS may be more like an immunomodulated disease than the traditional infectious disease discussed in the introduction. Such diseases as hepatitis A, measles, or typhoid often have their incubation periods depend on \u201cdose,\u201d because these diseases result from the direct pathologic effects of the microbes (8, 9, 12); however, diseases such as dengue, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and maybe SARS depend more on the immune system's response to the virus than on the direct pathologic effect of those viral infections.",

Generally, infection acquired at a young age was associated with an appreciably longer incubation period (16). However, our study showed that age had no significant effect on the SARS incubation period. Since an analysis of all 1,755 SARS patients in Hong Kong showed that there were a clear excess of young adults and a relative deficit of children and adolescents (20) and that health-care workers, who were mostly young, accounted for 21 percent of all SARS cases globally (14), our result might be partly explained by the age distribution of SARS patients.",

First, as the study was retrospective, it was very difficult to avoid recall bias. During the investigation of death cases with SARS, the close-contact information was obtained indirectly, which might affect the validity of results to some extent. Second, although efforts were made to sample SARS cases from all the provinces of mainland China, the availability was different in different affected areas and among the different populations affected. Therefore, selective bias was unavoidable. Finally, the SARS diagnosis at present is based mainly on symptoms and physical signs, and no specific diagnostic tests are available. Thus, although most of the probable SARS cases in this study were selected from clear transmission chains of SARS, and although some of the cases were further confirmed by the SARS-associated coronavirus antibody test, there might still be case misclassification bias. Despite these possible limitations, we believe that our results are, so far, the most reliable and available. They are useful for the development of intervention strategies and epidemic control.",
