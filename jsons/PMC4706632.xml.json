We hypothesized that the relationship of RVI with CLAD would be greater with shorter time periods based on the waning of the immune response to RVI over time. The primary outcome was development of CLAD. A secondary outcome was the composite endpoint of CLAD or death. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate and graph the probability of CLAD and its phenotypes BOS and R-CLAD. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using plots of Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were performed using Stata software, version 12.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas).",

In both univariate and multivariate analysis, RVI at all modeled risk periods was independently associated with development of CLAD (Table 4). The association was stronger at shorter modeled periods of risk. We confirmed the previously reported association of acute rejection with development of CLAD (Table 4). Our secondary endpoint, the composite endpoint of CLAD and death, showed a similar trend as the primary endpoint in both univariate and multivariate analysis, with a higher hazard ratio (HR) of RVI at 3 months and progressively declining HR as time from RVI increased (HR, 4.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.76\u20138.43; P < .01 vs HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.72\u20134.37; P < .01 at 3 months vs 12 months post-RVI, respectively). We also analyzed the association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and CLAD using 2 methods, first requiring a positive pH probe test for GERD diagnosis and second including anyone with a clinical diagnosis of GERD. No statistically significant association was seen in univariate analysis (data not shown) with either definition of GERD; therefore, GERD was not included in the final models. We were also interested in whether 1 CLAD phenotype was more strongly associated with RVI than the other (R-CLAD vs BOS). While the numbers are small, precluding a formal analysis, overall, a higher percentage of R-CLAD patients had at least 1 preceding viral episode as compared with BOS (9/17 [52.9%] vs 12/33 [36.4%], respectively).\n",

The association between RVI and CLAD was stronger with shorter modeled periods of risk but was also present when all follow-up time was considered. We demonstrate for the first time that the strength of the association of symptomatic RVI with CLAD is significantly influenced by time (eg, the proximity of the RVI episode with CLAD diagnosis). The stronger association in the first several months after RVI has important implications for future trials of antiviral agents, including powering trials for an endpoint of CLAD. This study also addresses several important limitations of prior studies, significantly extends our understanding of the role of RVI and CLAD, and provides a strong rationale for the conduct of large prospective studies to characterize the specific virologic determinants and mechanistic links between RVI and CLAD.",

However, they only considered LRTIs based largely on surveillance BALs and their cohort was small (38 LTRs, 14 with RVIs). While they followed the LTRs for 10 years for outcomes, RVI episodes were only recorded for the first year post-transplantation. Khalifah et al also reported an association between RVI and BOS in univariate and multivariate analyses in a retrospective cohort study [2], but they assessed only 4 viruses using nonmolecular methods, did not distinguish BOS and R-CLAD or use blinded reviewer assessment of CLAD, and included relatively few cases of RVI [22]. Billings et al found no relationship between RVI and CLAD overall, but a subanalysis demonstrated an association with high-grade BOS only for LRTI and had many of the same limitations as that of Khalifah et al [9]. In contrast to the above studies, Milstone et al reported no association; however, the sample size was small (only 4 BOS cases, 17 RVIs) [8].

We examined a large cohort of patients (among the largest to assess this issue) and diagnosed RVI using modern molecular diagnostic techniques that detected a large number of respiratory viruses. We used time-dependent multivariate analyses that controlled for factors associated previously with CLAD and also modeled differing periods of risk to provide insight into mechanisms the underlie the relationship between RVI and CLAD. Importantly, the primary endpoint (CLAD) was assigned using recently developed consensus definitions and by 2 blinded transplant pulmonologists. We also acknowledge certain limitations, including the retrospective single-center study design. Despite comprehensive medical records and close follow-up, we cannot exclude missing data. Thus, our rates of RVI should be considered minimal estimates because patients may have been diagnosed outside our medical center. We were not able to assess all the factors that have been linked to CLAD, including pseudomonas pneumonia and/or colonization [22\u201324] and small conidial forms of Aspergillus [22]. However, there is no consensus that these are proven risk factors for CLAD. Our study size was not large enough to permit assessment of risk of CLAD associated with specific viral organisms, nor was it large enough to assess differences between the 2 CLAD phenotypes, BOS and R-CLAD.",

            "text": "Although we found an independent association of symptomatic RVI with CLAD, it is possible that RVI could simply be a marker for patients who are otherwise predisposed to CLAD, rather than a cause of CLAD. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that RVI might be an underrecognized contributor (rather than marker) in a substantial proportion of CLAD cases. As summarized in Table 1, RVI has been linked to CLAD in several prior studies [2, 6\u201310, 25\u201329]. RVI is relatively common in LTRs, and a significant proportion of cases detected by sensitive methods can be asymptomatic. Importantly, both symptomatic and asymptomatic RVI has been linked to CLAD. Additionally, in vitro and animal studies have identified specific biologically plausible mechanisms through which RVI could mediate CLAD [30, 31]. RVI-mediated regulatory T-cell dysfunction leading to augmentation of innate, allo-, and auto-immune pathways are possible mechanistic pathways to explain a causal link between RVI and CLAD. Finally, a small clinical trial of a novel antiviral (siRNA) for a specific RVI (RSV) in LTRs demonstrated reduced risk for CLAD in the group randomized to active RSV therapy [32]. In total, these epidemiologic and experimental data are consistent with a causal association between RVI and CLAD.",

            "text": "In summary, our study addresses many of the limitations of prior studies and adds significantly to the body of evidence linking RVI to development of CLAD. This association is relevant as RVI could represent a distinct, diagnosable, and potentially treatable major cause of allograft dysfunction and loss in LTRs. If the association were confirmed in future prospective studies, at a minimum, it could identify specific patients at increased risk for development of CLAD who could then be entered into trials of preventive or treatment strategies. With the development of new antivirals for several respiratory viruses [32\u201335], it will be possible to directly test the hypothesis that RVI causes CLAD by means of interventional controlled trials. Prior to embarking on such studies, it is imperative to carefully characterize the virologic determinants and mechanisms that underlie CLAD in order to aid in the design of such interventional trials. While our study strongly suggests an association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD, we propose a large, multicenter, prospective natural history study with careful virologic and clinical assessments and mechanistic studies as a logical next step. A better understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of CLAD through future prospective studies is critical in devising rational strategies to improve long-term patient and graft survival in LTRs.",
