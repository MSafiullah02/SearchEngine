The first classification scheme by J.F. Brandt (1855) is based on morphology of the jaw and skull together with masticatory muscle position and has three suborders: Sciuromorpha (squirrel-like); Myomorpha (mouse-like); and Hystricomorpha (porcupine-like). The second separates rodents into two suborders, Sciurognathi and Hysticognathi, based on the position of incisors and the angle of the jaw (Carleton and Musser, 2005). Molecular studies yield seven clades containing three phylogenetic lineages: squirrel-related (Sciuriodea and Gliridae); mouse-related (Anomaluromorpha, Castoridae, Geomyoidae, and Myodonta); and Ctenohystrica. With diverse ecologic strategies, rodents are found naturally in a variety of habitats globally except Antarctica. The natural history and biology of members of this extensive order exhibit substantial variation. Nevertheless, similarities exist among rodents including dentition, anatomy, and disease susceptibility.",

Brachydonts have elondont incisors with brachydont molars; in Hystricomorphs, all of the teeth are elondont. Dentition is important when considering the diet and husbandry needs of these groups. Brachydonts, which include mice, rats, hamsters, and gerbils, need high calorie diets with low amounts of fiber, whereas the hystricomorphs (porcupine-like; guinea pigs, chinchillas, agoutis) are strictly herbivores and require ample abrasive roughage. Dental formulae vary but in general, rodents have four incisors, no canines, 1\u20132 premolars, and numerous (up to 12) molars.",

Most practice coprophagy or cecotrophy to maintain normal microflora and absorb microbially derived amino acids and vitamins (e.g., B and K). As such, herbivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous, and carnivorous rodents have different gastric and large intestinal anatomy. Some rodents lack gall bladders (e.g., rats and pocket gophers). Rats and hamsters are unable to vomit due to a muscular sphincter at the esophageal-gastric junction. Members of Caviidae lack the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase, making vitamin C (ascorbic acid) a necessary dietary requirement for this group (see scurvy in section, Nutritional Diseases).",

Rodents are nocturnal and though some species hibernate (e.g., woodchucks) but most of the species do not. There are numerous specializations among rodents including cheek pouches (food transport), extremity and claw development (e.g., burrowing, jumping, climbing, flying), sensory organ variations (e.g., vibrissae and large ears or eyes), special integument and pelage (e.g., porcupine quills and chinchilla fur), and tail adaptations (e.g., prehensile, fat storage). Rodents have a strong sense of smell and a well-developed vomeronasal organ, which is important for reproduction and social behavior through the sensing of pheromones. Since rodents lack sweat glands, they are susceptible to overheating.",

Like rabbits, chinchillas have two cervices that communicate with individual uterine horns. Vaginas are imperforate prior to sexual maturing and during nonbreeding and/or postpartum intervals. Placentation is discoid and hemochorial. Mammary gland anatomy varies among species. The suborders Scuirognatha and Stricognatha have altricial and precocial young, respectively. Some male rodents have testes within a scrotum, though the testes of porcupines, agoutis, chinchillas, cavies, and capybaras are located within the inguinal canal, which remains open in most male rodents. Male rodents also have well developed accessory sex glands and an os penis. Prairie dogs have perianal sacs similar to canids and felids, which are important for sexual communication. Male beavers have persistent paramesonephric ducts that resemble a uterus and are referred to as masculine uterus (Doboszynska and Zurowski, 1981, Meier et al., 1998).",

In general, the lifespan of rodent erythrocytes is shorter than other mammals, thus, higher levels of circulating reticulocytes (1%\u20136%), seen as polychromasia and anisocytosis, is considered normal. Howell-Jolly bodies may also be present. In all age groups, lymphocytes are more numerous than neutrophils. In fact, lymphocytes are the predominant white blood cells in guinea pigs (45%\u201380%). In addition, guinea pigs and capybaras have Kurloff cells (Fig. 20.3\n), which are lymphocytes containing a single, large intracytoplasmic mucopolysaccharide inclusion body, known as a Kurloff body (Jara et al., 2005). Though the actual function of these cells is unknown, they are presumed to be natural killer cells. The number of Kurloff cells in females fluctuate with the reproductive cycle stage, thus they are considered to be estrogen-dependent. Pregnant females may have 2%\u20135% Kurloff cells in circulation while males typically have fewer. Guinea pigs have heterophils similar to rabbits. Rats, mice, and hamsters commonly have neutrophils with ring-form nuclei. Chinchillas and porcupines have well-defined and segmented neutrophil nuclei. Band neutrophils may be a normal finding in some species including New World porcupines, coypu, and agoutis.",

In contrast, gamma glutamyl transferase is present in the liver of all rodents and can be evaluated to determine the hepatic injury or disease.

Guinea pigs and a number of other species including capybaras and humans, lack the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase which is required for l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) production therefore, these species require dietary vitamin C (Cueto et al., 2000). Vitamin C is necessary for the formation of collagen via hydroxylation of proline/lysine for cross linking of fibrillar collagen. Hypovitaminosis C results in decreased collagen fibril cross linking, leading to the increased fragility of blood vessels, cartilage, and osteoid. In affected individuals, gross and histologic lesions are characteristic and include capillary hemorrhage and lack of bone deposition and remodeling as a result of poorly formed and weak collagen. Other gross lesions include evidence of anemia (e.g., pallor, reactive bone marrow), periarticular hemorrhage, and swollen joints, specifically at the costochondral junctions (scorbutic lattice). Characteristic oral lesions include gingival swelling, erythema, hemorrhage, erosion, ulceration, and tooth loss. Histological examination is necessary to confirm and define bone lesions, which include: dilation of metaphyseal blood vessels, irregular columnization and hypertrophy of physeal cartilage, calcification of metaphyseal cartilage with reduced or absent osteoid, microfractures with surrounding and subperiosteal hemorrhage, medullary fibrosis, and decreased osteoclastic activity and remodeling. Tooth loss may result from a combination of abnormal odontoblasts, dentin resorption, pulp fibrosis, and a lack of/abnormal alveolar bone remodeling.",

Stress is thought to increase skin fragility and overcrowding with intraspecific aggression contributes to lesion development. Sun exposure, pruritus, and self-mutilation result in large patches of alopecia with erythema and excoriated skin with loss of the long hairs along the dorsum and tail. Microscopic lesions correlate to severity and chronicity and include variable epidermal degeneration, necrosis, erosion/ulceration, and associated dermatitis with hemorrhage and edema.

As there is no demonstrated metastatic potential or criteria for malignancy, these lesions are increasingly identified as hamartomas versus neoplasms (and also referred to as pseudo-odontomas). Nevertheless, these toothy masses are regionally destructive and almost exclusively affect the incisors. Grossly, odontogenic dysplasia presents as nodular swellings around the maxillary or mandibular incisors. Microscopically, these lesions are composed of disorganized and dysplastic proliferations of odontogenic epithelium, enamel matrix, and mineralized enamel, dentin, pulp, and cementum. In rodents, odontomas have been described as complex because they contain fully differentiated tooth elements but do not form the tooth-like structures grossly present in compound odontomas seen in other species (e.g., horse).

It affects both sexes and is typically found in animals greater than 4 years of age. Activated T cells (CD8 +) cause cellular and DNA damage leading to persistent hepatitis. Simultaneously, viral DNA integrates into the host genome at loci containing oncogenes, creating the potential for carcinogenic transformation. Hepatocellular carcinomas are reported in 100% of experimentally infected woodchucks. Grossly, most carcinomas are solitary and involve one hepatic lobe. Histologically, neoplastic masses have differing growth patterns: trabecular, adenoid, or solid with and without cystic spaces, hemorrhage, and necrosis. An interesting feature of these tumors is the presence of atypical, bizarre, and giant neoplastic cells. Adenomas may be present and are considered a precursor to carcinomas. Mitotic index and cellular morphology are used to classify tumors as adenomas versus carcinomas. The remaining hepatic parenchyma often contains acute and/or chronic hepatitis with neutrophilic to mononuclear inflammation, variable hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis, fibrosis, and biliary changes. Electron microscopic identification of the virus is definitive. Beechey ground squirrels have a similar virus with variable hepatic lesions (Cullen and Marion, 1996).",

Fleas spread the causative agent, Yersinia pestis, between hosts. Cats and other rodent-eating predators can also contract infection through ingestion and rarely via inhalation. Historically, plague has been implicated in the deaths of millions of humans, most notably in 14th century Europe during the Black Death. There are two main host types: enzootic reservoirs (voles and deer mice) and epizootic amplifiers (prairie dogs, rats, and squirrels). With close to 100% mortality, plague outbreaks in prairie dog colonies are a devastating and significant threat not only this species but to endangered black-footed ferrets, who are susceptible to disease because prairie dogs are their primary food source (Cully et al., 2010). There are three disease forms: bubonic (lymphadenomegaly with abscessation); pneumonic (necrotizing pneumonia with fibrinous pleuritis); and septicemic (multifocal necrosis of liver, lung, spleen, kidney, eye, brain). Gross lesions include multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage (Fig. 20.10\n), hemorrhagic lymph nodes, erythema of axillary and inguinal skin, splenomegaly and localized hemorrhage and necrosis in the dermis and subutis (suspected site of flea bite). Histologic lesions of bubonic disease include necrosuppurative lymphadenitis; in the pneumonic form, necrotizing pneumonia; and in the septicemic form, multifocal abscessation. All lesions contain Gram and Giemsa positive coccobacilli with characteristic bipolar morphology resembling a safety pin.

For example, approximately 20% of slender-tailed cloud rats at one zoological institution died with or as a result of cryptococcal pneumonia over a 15-year period (Berliner et al., 2007). These large, arboreal rodents were likely infected by contaminated substrates and may be a highly susceptible species, similar to some species of nonhuman primates and felids. Lesions included none or mild to severe, chronic granulomatous pneumonia with or without necrosis and regional lymphadenitis. Disseminated disease can produce subcutaneous nodules (cryptococcoma) and meningoencephalitis. Microscopically, characteristic fungal yeasts with narrow-based budding are present in cytologic preparations and histologic sections. GMS staining can enhance detection of fungal yeasts, which are 5\u201320 \u03bcm diameter with a distinct, thick (5\u201310 \u03bcm), nonstaining mucopolysaccharide capsule, the latter of which is best visualized using the PAS reaction and mucin stains. Culture can confirm infection (Fig. 20.15\n)",
