This classification is based on the onset and duration of symptoms and groups the children in three categories.\u2022\nTransient early wheezing. This is the most prevalent phenotype of early wheezing (60%) [9]. This condition generally starts in the first month of life, peaks before 3 years and resolves during the school age. Early wheezers tend to wheeze with lower respiratory tract infections, triggered by a virus, and generally have no family history of asthma or allergic sensitization. The primary risk factor seems to be a reduced lung function that remains low at age 6 years although wheezing has finished [9].\n",

This condition represents 20% of wheezing toddlers < 3 years of age [9]. Symptoms are more frequent in the 1st year of life and children may continue wheeze over childhood, typically with less frequent episodes by early adolescence. In most cases wheeze begins after an acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. These children present slightly lower pulmonary function compared to control from birth to 11 years of age. Typically they have not bronchial hyperreactivity. These findings are thought to be secondary to alterations in regulation of airway motor tone.\u2022\nAtopic wheezing/asthma. This phenotype accounts for the last 20% of wheezing children < 3 years of age [9]. More than half of all cases of persistent asthma start before age 3, and 80% begin before age 6 and are associated with early food or aeroallergen sensitization.

Hence, recently, in addition to the Tucson's groups further additional phenotypes have been proposed [12]. In particular, a group of children with intermediate onset wheeze has been defined with symptoms presenting between 12 and 42 months [12]. In this group it has been observed a strong association with atopy (in particular skin prick sensitivity to D. pteronyssinus and cat allergen), low lung function and higher levels of airway responsiveness.

It is possible that this group and prolonged wheezing represents different severities of the same wide phenotype, with the more severe phenotype being associated with longer duration of symptoms and poorer outcome [12].\u2022\nLate onset wheeze included children who start wheezing from 42 months of age and with a rising prevalence thereafter; this group showed a strong prevalence of atopy and asthma.\u2022\nPersistent wheeze included children who start wheezing at 6 months with an increasing prevalence thereafter. This phenotype was less strongly associated with atopy compared to intermediate or late onset wheeze, but was related with similar lung function deficits to intermediate onset wheeze.

Episodic (viral) wheeze is the most common phenotype in preschool children and it is characterized by distinct wheezing episodes with child being asymptomatic between episodes. Usually, it is associated with seasonal viral infection such as RSV, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. The frequency and severity of episodes are related to the severity of the first episode, atopy, prematurity and exposure to environmental factors such as tobacco smoke. Episodic wheeze declines over time disappearing within the age of 6 years, can continue as episodic wheeze in school age, change into multiple trigger wheeze or disappear later. Multiple-trigger wheeze is the second phenotype caused by the exposition to viruses or other important triggers such as cigarette smoking and allergen exposure, some children may also wheeze in response to spray, crying, laughter and exercise [12].",

It is of primary importance to determine the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms, their association with trigger factors such as physical exercise, viral infections, smoke and environmental allergens as well as the presence of a history of eczema or a parental history of asthma, eosinophilia, allergic rhinitis, and wheezing without colds [15]. Although no evidence is available regarding the usefulness of physical examination in wheeze assessment, it is important to recognize unusual or atypical features that would suggest another underlying condition [13]. A clinical index has been also proposed to define the risk of asthma development in the single patient according to the criteria of the Asthma Predictive Index (API) [16]. This index is based on the identification of risk factors during the first 3 years of life for development of asthma at school age. A positive API at age of 3 years is associated with 76% of chance of asthma development, compared with a less than 5% chance of active asthma at school age in children with a negative API index [16].",

However there are no studies supporting the usefulness of pulmonary function tests in preschool children in distinguishing between episodic and multiple-trigger wheeze [13]. In a longitudinal, prospective study conducted in preschool children with symptoms suggestive of asthma both FeNO and specific IgE measured at age four, but not lung functional tests (Rint), improved the prediction of asthma symptoms until the age of eight years, and independent of clinical history [25].

As clearly indicated in the GINA guidelines, good levels of control consider only minimal symptoms as acceptable [26]. To achieve and maintain this target, patients should be reviewed three months after the initial assessment and then every three months. In the case of an exacerbation, a follow-up visit should be scheduled within two\u2013four weeks [27]. In a study conducted in younger children, it was observed that clinicians are likely to obtain important and complementary information from children and their parents about symptoms reports and quality of life measures [28]. For these reasons, the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) was recently validated and proposed as an accurate and a reliable tool, complementary to lung function testing, to assess the level of disease control in asthmatic children [29]. However C-ACT should be used as a complement to, and not as an alternative to, other tools such as spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement in the evaluation of asthma control in children [30]. This is in keeping with the concept that, though a number of tools have been considered in the monitoring of childhood asthma, a combination of different ones is still recommended for the purpose of a comprehensive evaluation of the level of control [26]. Since asthma is primarily an inflammatory disease, the addition of a measure of inflammation, like FeNO determination, to standard spirometry and asthma control surveys may add novel information to assess asthma burden during the routine clinical follow-up of asthmatic children [20].",
