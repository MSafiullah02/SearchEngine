Antibody production is dependent, in part on cell culture and the lack of understanding of the extent of biological community complexity attributes to the limited use of methods relying on culture. Nonculturable organisms can only be identified by molecular genetic methods. Singleplex, multiplex and reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR (RT\u2013PCR) approaches have become standard methods for most laboratories. Furthermore, nucleic acid\u2010based methods (PCR and sequencing) are more sensitive than antibody\u2010based detection systems (Lim et al. 2005).",

Unlike Sanger sequencing, the use of pyrosequencing for sequencing\u2010by\u2010synthesis does not require fluorescent labelling. Incorporation of each dNTP is accompanied by release of pyrophosphate, which is converted by sulfurylase into ATP, which leads to the release of light from the conversion of luciferase to oxyluciferin.

Each with a unique profile of genetic content, GC\u2010richness, high\u2010copy repeats and low\u2010copy repeats (Bacolla et al. 2006). Particularly near regions of structurally important sequences, such as the centromere, the genomic landscape can become quite problematic for analysis. The primary factor contributing to the difficulty in studying these areas within the genome is that clusters of genomic duplications and unusual repeat structures often lie in close proximity. Consequently, sequence similarity\u2010based methods of global genome assembly fail to properly assign the correct positions of duplicated sequences. Annotation and interpretation of data from current DNA sequencing technologies can be difficult, because artificial overlaps form, significant warping of working draft sequences occurs, and numerous gaps appear in the assembly, all which, reduce overall quality and relevance of the assembly. These effects are further compounded by the absence of unique sequence\u2010tagged sites (STS) or DNA landmarks within such regions and a general under\u2010representation of such areas in clone\u2010by\u2010clone sequencing.
