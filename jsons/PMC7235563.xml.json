Even lower risk procedures, such as neuroimaging and lumbar puncture when multiple sclerosis is suspected, are planned in collaboration with internist colleagues. Vitrectomy is deferred if possible, but may be essential for diagnosing certain conditions, such as vitreoretinal lymphoma or infectious retinitis. The operation can be performed under local anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care, rather than general anesthesia.
