We designed a randomized, prospective clinical study. PVE quick ELISA test-positive dogs between 4 and 12 months of age were included in the study. Each of metoclopramide, ondansetron, maropitant and control group had 8 dogs. Metoclopramide and ondansetron were administered as 0.5 mg/kg doses three times a day via intravenous route, and maropitant was administered as 1 mg/kg doses once a day subcutaneously. The number and severity of daily vomitings were recorded. All dogs were treated and monitored for five days; treatments were continued until all animals healed. Metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant decreased the severity of vomiting from the first day and the vomiting numbers from the third day in PVE treatment. Obtained results showed that maropitant can be used successfully such as metoclopramide and ondansetron, which are frequently used for PVE treatment. At the same time, it was discovered that metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant were equally effective in reducing the frequency and severity of vomiting.

Dogs with PVE may either be asymptomatic or may die with severe clinical signs shortly. Virus attacks rapidly dividing cells (especially) the GI tract and bone marrow. Clinical signs often start with anorexia, lethargy, fever and progress within 1-2 days to vomitus and diarrhoea, which may be yellow, mucoid or haemorrhagic (Crawford & Sellon, 2010) . Vomiting is usually prominent and may be severe enough to mimic foreign body obstruction and/or cause esophagitis (Willard, 2009 ).

This shows that metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant reduced the frequency of vomiting starting with day 3 compared with the control group. None of the three drugs was superior to one another with regard to the frequency of vomiting. Sedlacek et al. (2008) used 0.9% NaCl, maropitant, metoclopramide and chlorpromazine to prevent vomiting in patients that were administered apomorphine and ipecac syrup. They reported that maropitant has a similar effect to metoclopramide and chlorpromazine in preventing apomorphine-induced central vomiting, and this effect is significantly superior to ondansetron. They determined that maropitant was as effective as ondansetron in the prevention of ipecac syrup-related vomiting and that it was superior to metoclopramide and chlorpromazine. Lenberg et al. (2012) compared maropitant and ondansetron in dogs with PVE. They reported that both drugs were similar regarding the number and severity of vomiting and the time to recovery. During hospitalization, the dogs were compared according to live weight, and maropitant was detected to induce weight gain and ondansetron was detected to induce weight loss.
