However, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19, a pattern resembling that of influenza but not SARS-CoV [17] .

ACE2 can also bind spike protein through association with B0AT1 [20] . ACE2 locates on the organs such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder and ileum, and in particular on the cell types such as type II alveolar cells, myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells, providing clues for further investigating the pathogenesis COVID-19 [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 531, "end": 535, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 843, "end": 847, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 848, "end": 851, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1392, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The virus"}, {"text": "So far, neither drug nor vaccine has been approved to treat the novel COVID-19.

For example, virally targeted agents, approved nucleoside analogs (favipiravir and ribavirin) and experimental nucleoside analogs (remdesivir and galidesivir), may have potentials against SARS-CoV-2 [22] .
