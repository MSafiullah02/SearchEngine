Traditionally, virus classification relied on properties such as virion morphology, genome organization, replication mechanism, serology, natural host range, mode of transmission, and pathogenicity. Yet viruses sharing the above properties can reveal tremendous differences at the genome level. For example, classification of many phages is currently based on presence, structure, and length of a tail, and this approach has been shown not to correlate with genomic information, leading to a very difficult situation and hundreds of unclassified phages.",

An alignment is an arrangement of residues of two or more sequences in a way that reveals their possible relatedness, with space characters inserted into the sequences to indicate single-residue insertions and deletions. A variety of algorithms and programs are available to suit a wide range of problems requiring sequence alignments as parts of their solutions. Depending on the specifics of a problem, different types of algorithms or their combinations may work best. Most alignment algorithms can be broadly categorized by the scope of their application on sequences (local vs. global), or by the number of sequences involved (pairwise vs. multiple).",

The widely used affine scheme assigns substitution scores to substitutions and a penalty to each space, and an additional penalty to each gap defined as a maximal consecutive run of spaces. Given a set of sequences, an alignment is called optimal if it has the maximal score over all possible alignments.

However, the group also includes a pair containing St. Croix river virus and palyam virus, which both currently belong to the genus Orbivirus. Further investigation using PASC revealed that palyam virus has identities higher than 59% with many other viruses in the family, and therefore is indeed an orbivirus.

The whole genome PASC may not work well for virus families with highly diverse sequences. This includes viruses with low overall sequence similarities or large differences in genome sizes and organization. For example, in the family Herpesviridae, the percentage of identity between different species in the genus Varicellovirus ranges from 39% (between cercopithecine herpesvirus 9 and suid herpesvirus 1) to 83% (between bovine herpesvirus 1 and bovine herpesvirus 5), while the percentage of identity between a virus in the genus Simplexvirus and one in the genus Varicellovirus could be as high as 54% (between cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 and bovine herpesvirus 5). The overlap of such identities makes it impossible to determine the species and genus demarcations for herpesviruses. In the family Poxviridae, the largest genome (canarypox virus) is almost 3 times as big as the smallest one (bovine papular stomatitis virus). The huge differences in the genomes sizes will introduce large artifacts when calculating the identities. In such cases, single gene or a cluster of genes needs to be used in PASC instead of whole genomes. The polymerase protein sequences of poxviruses have been used to perform PASC and a good result was obtained. However, not every single gene can be used for PASC. The genes must be present in all viruses of a family and be very conserved. They need to be tested extensively and accepted by the research community as a useful taxonomic criterion before being applied to the PASC system.",

For demarcations computed using different types of distances, it may be difficult to choose a rational reason to privilege one demarcation threshold over another. Moreover, once a demarcation is adopted and a researcher uses a different definition to measure the distance between a new virus and an existing one, the comparison with the histogram will sometimes be misleading.

            "text": "PASC is a molecular classification tool for many virus families. It calculates the pairwise identities of virus sequences within a virus family and displays their distributions, and can help determine the demarcations at strains, species, genera, and subfamilies level. PASC has many advantages over conventional virus classification methods. The tool has been successfully applied to many virus families, although it may not work well for virus families with highly diverse sequences. The PASC tool at NCBI established distributions of identity for a number of virus families. A new virus sequence can be tested with this system within a few minutes to suggest the taxonomic position of the virus in these families. This system eliminates the potential discrepancies in the results caused by different algorithms and/or different data used by the virology community. Data in the system can be updated automatically to reflect changes in virus taxonomy and additions of new virus sequences to the public database. The web interface of the tool makes it easy to navigate and perform analyses.",
