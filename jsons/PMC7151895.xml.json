In the stable isotope labeling approach, the isotopic composition of specific atoms is altered, depending on the intended purpose.

Therefore, 2H does not disturb 1H NMR spectra. In addition, the magnetogyric ratio of 2H is \u223c6.5 times lower than that of 1H, and thus the substitution of 1H to 2H mitigates the dipolar and scalar couplings for the remaining 1H atoms without altering the structure, dynamics, and function of the protein.",

Thus, each protein molecule in the NMR sample tube has a different 2H labeling pattern. The NMR signals from the residual protons in the random fractionally deuterated proteins yield useful structural information similar to that obtained from the fully protonated proteins, except that the NMR signals are narrower. The usefulness of random fractional deuteration has been demonstrated for a variety of proteins, such as thioredoxin and staphylococcal nuclease.[11], [12] LeMaster and Richards achieved the chemical shift assignment for Escherichia coli thioredoxin using \u223c75% random fractional deuteration.11 This 108-amino acid residue protein was previously considered to be too large for an analysis with 1H\u20131H homonuclear two-dimensional (2-D) NMR spectra. Their report clearly showed how 2H labeling could alleviate the molecular size limitation for NMR studies. However, the chemical shifts in a deuterated sample are slightly different from those in a fully protonated sample due to deuterium-induced isotope shifts, and thus the residual proton signals were more complex, as described later.",

            "text": "The most important reason to label protein samples with 13C and 15N is to introduce the heteronuclear NMR dimensions into NMR spectroscopy, which facilitate the analysis of complex proton NMR spectra. The heteronuclear one-bond spin couplings between 13C/15N and directly attached 1H are large enough to efficiently transfer nuclear magnetization through these spin couplings, which facilitates a variety of heteronuclear multidimensional experiments.15 The availability of multidimensional experiments enormously expands the range of NMR study, and these provide a wealth of information on the protein. For example, the [1H,15N] heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) spectrum from a uniformly 15N-labeled protein can be used to evaluate the quality of the NMR sample. Therefore, an NMR study of a new protein often starts with the preparation of the uniformly 15N-labeled protein. A good quality [1H,15N] HSQC spectrum promises advanced NMR analysis; otherwise, further optimization of the NMR sample should be performed in a trial-and-error manner. Once a preparation method for an NMR sample with good quality is established, the uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled protein is prepared, with the aim of the sequential assignment of the backbone and, if required, side chain resonances. For the assignment of the NMR resonances in uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled proteins, a series of heteronuclear multidimensional experiments have been established, which are now widely and routinely employed.[16], [17] The assignment of the NMR resonances enables a wide variety of NMR studies on protein structures, dynamics, and interactions at an atomic resolution, even in the case of relatively large proteins. For example, the structure determination of a protein up to 25 kDa can be achieved by employing uniform 13C and 15N labeling and the heteronuclear multidimensional NMR method.18 The emergence of the 13C and 15N labeling approach and multidimensional experiments has enormously advanced NMR investigations of proteins smaller than 25 kDa.",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that the application of 13C labeling is not limited to heteronuclear correlation experiments. An NMR experiment using direct 13C observation may also yield useful structural information, which cannot easily be obtained by the other methods. The utility of the 13C NMR experiments has been well demonstrated through the observation of backbone carbonyl carbons.[1], [19], [21], [20] In contrast to the 1H detection experiments, the signal dispersion in the 13C chemical shifts and the narrower linewidths are advantages of the 13C direct observation approach for relatively large proteins. The study on Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), a 23-kDa homodimer, is a classic example of such an approach. Residue selective 13C labeling was used to observe the carbonyl carbon signal of the functionally important Met residue (Met73\u2013Val74; P1\u2013P1\u2032).19 To differentiate the three Met carbonyl carbon signals, an SSI sample simultaneously labeled with [1-13C]Met and [15N]Val was prepared. Because the other two Met residues have different N-terminal neighbors, only the Met73 signals showed a 15-Hz one-bond 13C\u201315N spin coupling. This type of method, which is referred to as selective 13C,15N double labeling, is the prototype of the widely used sequential assignment method using uniformly 13C,15N double-labeled proteins. The original selective 13C,15N double-labeling method by itself is still often used as a reliable assignment method for the carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen signals of backbone peptides. Another interesting application of carbonyl carbons is the effect of deuterium\u2013hydrogen exchange of amides on the line shapes, known as the deuterium\u2013hydrogen exchange of amide on the line shapes (DEALS) method.20 This method can be used to investigate the hydrogen exchange rate of backbone amide groups in proteins. When the carbon spectra of proteins dissolved in H2O and D2O solutions are compared, the chemical shifts of their backbone carbonyl carbons differ by \u223c0.1 ppm between them. This difference arises from the proton/deuterium substitution in the amide groups of its own residue and the following residue, which is known as the deuterium isotope shift. In the DEALS method, the backbone carbonyl carbon peaks are observed in a mixture of H2O and D2O. In these circumstances, when the lifetime of the amide proton is longer than the inverse of the deuterium isotope shift in the hertz scale, the carbon peaks appear as separate peaks. Conversely, when the exchange rate is rapid, the carbon peaks appear as single averaged peaks. Therefore, slowly exchanging amide protons can readily be identified based on their line shape on the carbon spectrum. This method has an advantage in that the experiment can be conducted in a steady state, which enables the relatively precise estimation of the exchange rate, compared to other proton/deuterium exchange experiments that utilize real-time monitoring. Improvements in sensitivity, using cryogenic probes, have enabled 13C detection in multidimensional protein NMR spectroscopy.[22], [24], [23] Further development of the pulse sequences with non-proton detection might allow the establishment of a new strategy of NMR structure determination without 1H\u20131H nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), using fully deuterated and 13C-/15N-labeled proteins.",

This strategy is especially effective for analyzing backbone atoms. A suite of NMR experiments for assigning the backbone atoms of 2H/13C/15N-labeled proteins has also been established.25 Furthermore, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY), which utilizes the destructive interference between dipole interactions and chemical shift anisotropy, yields narrower lines for the amide and aromatic resonances of larger proteins.[26], [27] With a polarization transfer scheme based on cross-correlated relaxation,28 observations of the NMR signals of large protein\u2013ligand complexes (>100 kDa) can be accomplished.29 The combined use of random fractional deuteration and uniform 13C /15N labeling has been applied for the structural analysis of proteins.30 However, it should be kept in mind that random fractional 2H labeling causes some spectral complications due to the presence of several isotopomers.[31], [32] The substitution of 1H by 2H induces upfield chemical shift changes of the carbons separated by one to three chemical bonds from the substituted atom. For example, in the case of a methyl group, as many as four isotopomers \u2013 namely CD3, CHD2, CH2D, and CH3 \u2013 exist simultaneously. Each isotopomer gives signals at slightly different positions on the [1H,13C] HSQC spectrum, leading to a more complicated NMR spectrum.32\n",

The merits of the use of 2H labeling, such as line narrowing and reduced spin diffusion, are quite important when studying large proteins by NMR. The SAIL method utilizes proteins exclusively composed of stereo- and regioselectively labeled amino acids (SAIL amino acids) for NMR studies.7 In the SAIL amino acids, selected protons are substituted by deuterium, such that each carbon or nitrogen nucleus in the final protein will have at most one 1H nucleus bonded to it. In addition, 13C and 15N are used only where a 1H is bound to it or where it is needed for uninterrupted through-bond assignment pathways. To achieve this, SAIL amino acids are designed as follows (Figure 1\n):1.Stereoselective replacement of one 1H in a methylene group by 2H.2.Replacement of two 1H in each methyl group by 2H.3.Stereoselective modification of the prochiral methyl groups of Leu and Val, such that one methyl is \u201312C(2H)3 and the other is \u201313C1H(2H)2.4.Labeling of six-membered aromatic rings by alternating 12C\u20132H and 13C\u20131H moieties.The 20 SAIL amino acids (Figure 2\n) were synthesized based on these design concepts by chemical and enzymatic means.

The labeling pattern of SAIL amino acids preserves the through-bond connectivity required for backbone and side chain assignments. However, the extensive deuteration of the side chain protons enables efficient transfer of the magnetization. In addition, the stereospecific deuteration in the methylene and prochiral methyl groups eliminates the need for their stereospecific assignment. Thus, a higher level of assignment can readily be achieved by using SAIL proteins compared to UL proteins.",

A brief consideration shows that the number of nonexchangeable side chain protons in SAIL proteins is less than half, and the number of expected NOESY cross peaks is decreased by 40\u201345%, relative to UL proteins. However, most of the additional NOEs from UL proteins either involve fixed (geminal) distances or become redundant in the absence of stereospecific assignments and cause spectral overlap without furnishing independent information. In practice, the stereospecific assignment of methylene and prochiral methyl groups is quite difficult. Indeed, the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) contains the stereospecific assignments for well below 10% of the methylene protons and the Val/Leu methyl groups. On the other hand, the NOE distance constraints obtained from SAIL proteins are effective in defining the conformations of proteins due to the information from their exclusive stereospecific assignments33 and the rare signal overlap. In addition, the proton density is decreased in SAIL proteins, which mitigates spin diffusion and thus improves the accuracy of the interproton distance measurements from NOE peaks (Figure 3\n). More detailed theoretical considerations,7 which take into account the enhanced signal strength and sharper lines in SAIL spectra and the fact that overlap can render peaks unidentifiable, have shown that in practice, with larger molecules, SAIL is expected to increase, rather than decrease, the number of identifiable NOE cross peaks. The expected increase is moderate in regions without overlap but significant in regions with strong overlap. Thus, for larger proteins, SAIL is expected to yield two or more times the number of relevant conformational restraints as uniform labeling.",

            "text": "Ideally, the SAIL technique could be applied to the NMR structure determinations of proteins larger than 50 kDa and membrane proteins. To this end, it will presumably be necessary to further optimize the isotope labeling patterns of each SAIL amino acid in order to cope with the extensive crowding and line broadening resulting from the large molecular size. In an overlap and relaxation-optimized version of the SAIL approach, the number of 1H nuclei is reduced further to enable the observation of well-shaped and separated signals, even for proteins larger than 50 kDa. SAIL patterns can be characterized by the percentage of 1H atoms relative to the uniformly labeled protein in an H2O solution. The original SAIL amino acids retain 64% of all protons and 44% of all side chain protons.7 An overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL pattern comprised 53% of all protons and only 28% of all side chain protons.34 The modified SAIL 1H labeling pattern is essentially a subset of the original SAIL amino acids. For instance, a uniformly 13C-labeled Leu side chain contains four 13C and nine 1H nuclei. The original SAIL pattern reduces the NMR-active nuclei to three 13C and three 1H. In the case of overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL, the H\u03b3 methine proton, which tends to be overlapped and to provide only largely redundant NOEs, is additionally replaced by 2H. C\u03b3 can either be replaced by 12C for further reduction of the relaxation or be kept as 13C to enable the assignment of the 13C1H(2H)2 methyl group by through-bond experiments. Simulations suggest that the combined use of optimized SAIL patterns and automated structure calculation algorithms with CYANA has high potential for the automated structure determinations of higher molecular weight proteins as well as membrane proteins.34 The precision of the structure generated using the overlap and relaxation-optimized modified SAIL pattern was slightly lower than that obtained by uniform labeling and the original SAIL method because the modified SAIL method reduces the number of peaks expected under ideal conditions. However, with the actual experimental data, better results can be expected for this overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL because it facilitates the analysis of many otherwise broadened or overlapped signals. The overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL patterns may thus contribute to the determination of high-quality solution structures of proteins in the 30- to 100-kDa range and membrane proteins.",

First, this allows for a comparison between the NMR spectra obtained from in vivo and in vitro expression. The [1H,15N] HSQC spectra from both approaches should be compared to detect any possible difference between in vivo and in vitro expression. It should be kept in mind that N-terminal processing does not necessarily occur in the case of cell-free synthesis.45 Second, it is less costly and requires less effort to produce proteins from E. coli cells than by the cell-free method. Thus, optimizations of the purification protocol and the NMR buffer conditions should be performed using proteins produced by E. coli. Third, most proteins that are expressed well in E. coli cells can be produced successfully by the cell-free method. Among 44 proteins that were expressed in E. coli, 35 (80%) were also found to work well in the cell-free synthesis system. Thus, a protein that is expressed well in E. coli cells also has a good chance of being produced well in the cell-free system.",

The activity also depends on how the extract is prepared and its concentration. The presence of DTT in the S30 extract is necessary for preserving its activity over time.

Pour the dialysis solution into the outer tube. Place the inner membrane apparatus of the Float-A-Lyzer within the outer tube, and pour the reaction solution into the inner membrane. Cover the tube with Parafilm.3.Shake the tube to facilitate the production of target proteins. The optimal temperature and incubation times should be determined in small-scale cell-free reactions with reaction and dialysis solution volumes of 0.5 and 2.0 ml, respectively, prior to the large-scale reaction.4.Retrieve the reaction solution and the dialysis solution. If the produced protein has a molecular weight smaller than the molecular weight cutoff of the membrane, check the outer solution for the presence of the protein.5.Purify the produced protein according to the purification procedures for the target protein. The N terminus of the protein produced by cell-free expression may be heterogeneous due to incomplete deformylation by peptide deformylase.

The silent mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein but leads to changes in the yield, presumably by affecting the formation of secondary structures in the mRNA. For this purpose, the ProteoExpert software (Roche Applied Science; Biomax) was used, although full details on the algorithm are unavailable. One round of calculations provides ten suggested candidates for silent mutations in the region close to the N terminus of the protein. Roche recommends introducing these mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) into linear templates and using small-scale syntheses to monitor the relative yields.

In this case, not only the cell-free expression system but also well-established and thus more robust in vivo expression systems can be used for protein production, provided that the added SAIL amino acid is not affected by metabolic scrambling. Compared to in vitro expression, however, in vivo expression according to the conventional procedure requires a much larger amount of the amino acid to obtain the intended amount in the target protein. One strategy to overcome this problem involves the use of auxotrophic E. coli strains. By growing the E. coli auxotrophic strain in minimal medium containing a small amount of the target isotope labeled amino acid and a large amount of the 19 other unlabeled amino acids, a reasonable yield of the selectively labeled protein can be obtained:1.Transform the expression vector into an auxotrophic E. coli strain. The authors often use AB2826 (DE3) strains for selective labeling by SAIL aromatic amino acids.2.Prepare amino acid-containing M9 medium with different amounts of phenylalanine. The basic composition of the medium is listed in Table 2\n. The key point concerning this method is that the amount of the target amino acid can be decreased without reducing the yield. For instance, in the case of phenylalanine, the amount can be decreased to \u223c10 mg l\u22121 while retaining a reasonable yield.3.Pick the colonies, and inoculate them into LB medium.4.Pellet the E. coli cells grown on the LB medium, and resuspend them in the minimal medium.5.Grow the E. coli cells to an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.7.6.Induce the expression by adding IPTG.7.After a defined amount of time, stop the culture and check the protein expression by SDS-PAGE.\n",

The fewer long-range couplings result in further signal sharpening. The signal intensities for methylene groups are three to seven times higher with SAIL than with uniform labeling under the same conditions. Although each observed SAIL methyl group contained only one 1H, compared to three equivalent 1H with uniform labeling, comparable signal intensities were observed for the methyl groups as a result of the longer 1H and 13C transverse relaxation times.",

However, it is often difficult to analyze these spectral regions in uniformly 13C/15N-labeled proteins, especially for Phe and Tyr residues. In addition to the inherently low sensitivity, the resonances of the \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6 ring carbons of Phe residues and the \u03b4 carbons of Tyr residues are prone to overlap with each other in NMR spectra. Such limited chemical shift dispersion and strong 13C\u201313C spin couplings hamper the spectral analyses, especially for Phe residues. Furthermore, exchange broadening due to aromatic ring flipping motions, which have occasionally been reported in the literature,[53], [54] makes the NMR signals for the \u03b4 and \u03b5 atoms of some Phe and Tyr residues even more difficult, or sometimes impossible, to observe. In the SAIL aromatic amino acids, new 2H,13C labeling patterns were introduced to make the NMR spectra for aromatic resonances simple and sensitive and to facilitate their spectral assignment by exclusively using through-bond correlations.39\nFigure 4\nillustrates the repertoire of the currently available SAIL Phe and SAIL Tyr amino acids. In the [13C\u03b3,13C\u03b5,1H\u03b5]-Tyr/Phe pattern (\u03b5-SAIL Tyr/Phe), all nonexchangeable hydrogens in the aromatic rings, except for the \u03b5 position, were replaced with 2H, and only the carbons at the \u03b3 and \u03b5 positions were labeled with 13C. In the other pattern, denoted as [13C\u03b3,13C\u03b6,1H\u03b6]-Phe (\u03b6-SAIL Phe), the hydrogens at the \u03b4 and \u03b5 positions of Phe were replaced with 2H, and the carbons at the \u03b3 and \u03b6 positions were labeled with 13C. In all cases, the aliphatic moieties were uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N, and the pro-R hydrogen of the \u03b2-methylene group was stereospecifically labeled with 2H, thus enabling the unambiguous stereospecific assignment of the prochiral methylene signals. All of the SAIL Phe and Tyr residues lack directly bonded aromatic 13C\u201313C pairs in order to avoid strong one-bond 13C\u201313C scalar couplings, and the alternate 2H labeling eliminates large scalar and dipolar interactions among the ring protons.",

It is obvious that the severe signal overlap observed for uniformly [13C,15N]-labeled Phe is resolved by using SAIL Phe because of the absence of resonances and the sharpening of the remaining resonances. Employing SAIL Phe increased the aromatic signal intensities. One of the reasons for the improvement is the attenuation of dipolar interactions, which was achieved by replacing the hydrogens adjacent to the detected nuclei with 2H. In the case of the uniformly 13C-labeled aromatic ring, a long (17- or 34-ms) constant time evolution period, which causes a reduction of the magnetization, must be used in the [1H,13C] HSQC measurement to refocus the 13C\u201313C couplings.

The 3-D HBCB(CG)HE experiment can also be performed in a 2-D version, (HB)CB(CG)HE. These pulse sequences are composed of previously employed building blocks55 and are similar to the previously reported sequences, (H\u03b2)C\u03b2(C\u03b3C\u03b4)H\u03b4 and (H\u03b2)C\u03b2(C\u03b3C\u03b4C\u03b5)H\u03b5.56 A major difference between the previously published sequences and the sequences for SAIL proteins is the incorporation of H\u03b2 evolution. This was feasible because the stereoselective deuteration in the \u03b2 methylene group alleviated the overlap of the H\u03b2 resonances and prolonged the H\u03b2 relaxation time. In addition, the slower relaxation of 13C\u03b2, due to the deuteration, also enhanced the measurement sensitivity. In the case of HBCB(CG)HE, the magnetization is transferred from C\u03b3 to H\u03b5 directly via 3\nJ\nC\u03b3H\u03b5 (7.9 Hz for Phe and 7.1 Hz for Tyr) after the transfer to C\u03b3. In the HBCB(CGCZ)HZ experiment, the magnetization is transferred from C\u03b3 to C\u03b6 via 3\nJ\nC\u03b3C\u03b6 (9.3 Hz), before the final C\u03b6\u2013H\u03b6 one-bond INEPT transfer. The site-specific 2H and 13C labeling patterns made it possible to transfer the magnetization through long-range scalar couplings. Using these experiments, the correlations between the H\u03b2 and the ring protons could be detected for Phe and Tyr residues in calmodulin and EPPIb, except for those undergoing aromatic flipping-broadening.[39], [57]\n",

Compared to UL proteins, a high degree of resonance assignment can readily be accomplished by using SAIL proteins. As described in Section 1.16.3.2, spin relaxation is weakened in SAIL proteins compared to the corresponding UL proteins, which allows long NOE-derived distance constraints to be obtained. Prior knowledge of the stereospecific assignment eliminates the need for using pseudo atoms for methylene and prochiral methyl groups. Distance restraints for the structure calculation were obtained from 3-D 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra58 and from a 2-D NOESY spectrum for the aromatic region. These spectra were simplified by the presence of fewer signals, as expected.

The SAIL-labeled protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than the uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled protein. Profound improvement of the aromatic spectra quality was observed for SAIL proteins, which enabled the determination of the homodimeric solution structure.65 The NMR structure is almost identical to the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA binding domain at the N terminus (Figure 7(b)). The disordered region contains positively charged residues, which were shown to be involved in nucleic acid interactions.

The backbone assignment of EPPIb was previously accomplished by using a uniformly 13C,15N double-labeled sample prepared by the cell-free method.69 EPPIb contains 12 Phe and 3 Tyr residues, some of which form a hydrophobic cluster. Thus, the collection of NOEs involving the aromatic residues is essential for the precise structure determination of this protein. For this purpose, the use of SAIL aromatic residues was found to be very effective. The aromatic ring signals of its 12 Phe residues were well resolved for all SAIL Phe types and could be assigned readily by correlating them to the previously assigned backbone signals.57 Importantly, for the \u03b4- and \u03b5-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb proteins, the signals of Phe27, Phe110, and Phe123 were broadened beyond detection due to the intermediate ring flipping rates of these residues at 30 \u00b0C, except for a single, very weak peak assigned to the \u03b4-13C/1H signal of Phe110. At 40 \u00b0C, this weak \u03b4-13C/1H cross peak became sharper due to the increased ring flipping rate of Phe110. In contrast, all 12 peaks were clearly observed for the \u03b6 signals in \u03b6-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb. The \u03b6 signals are not affected by ring flipping because the \u03b6\n13C\u20131H moiety lies on the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 axis.",

More than 100 NOESY cross peaks involving the aromatic rings of Phe and Tyr were observed for the \u03b4-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination, whereas the corresponding number of NOEs for the \u03b6-SAIL Phe/\u03b5-SAIL Tyr combination was \u223c50. However, approximately half of the NOEs acquired for the \u03b4-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination were intraresidual or sequential and thus did not conceivably contribute to defining the overall structure. In contrast, in the case of the \u03b6-SAIL Phe/\u03b5-SAIL Tyr combination, most of the NOEs were observed between sequentially distant residues. Consequently, the convergence of the resulting structural ensemble calculated with CYANA is much better for the \u03b6-SAIL Phe/\u03b5-SAIL Tyr combination than for the \u03b4-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination (Figure 8\n). The precision of the structure was slightly lower for the \u03b4-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination compared to the other structures, especially for two loop regions on the protein surface. This local structural difference is due to the complete lack of NOE restraints between the rings of Phe55 and His147, which were clearly observed for \u03b5- and \u03b6-SAIL Phe but not for \u03b4-SAIL Phe. The lack of NOEs for the \u03b4 and \u03b5 protons of Phe27, Phe110, and Phe123 is due to the intermediate ring flipping rates and is clearly reflected in the poorly defined ring positions of these three Phe residues, although their backbone conformation was defined by other NOEs. The structure determined by the simultaneous use of all NOEs observed with the aforementioned three combinations of SAIL Phe/Tyr was well-defined, with a root mean square deviation against the crystal structure of EPPIb70 of 1.43 \u00c5 for the backbone atoms, excluding the unstructured loop regions. Because the structural quality obtained by the \u03b6-SAIL Phe/\u03b5-SAIL Tyr combination is very similar to that generated by the combined NOE data using all three combinations, the \u03b6-SAIL Phe/\u03b5-SAIL Tyr combination may be a good choice for structure determinations.",

One of the applications is a hydrogen exchange study of Tyr side chain hydroxyl groups.71 In principle, this method is an extension of the DEALS method, which is used for investigating the hydrogen exchange of backbone amide groups, to study the hydrogen exchange of hydroxyl groups.20 In the case of Tyr hydroxyl groups, proton/deuterium substitution slightly alters the chemical shifts of the carbon atom at the \u03b6 position in the Tyr ring by \u223c0.13 ppm due to the proton/deuterium isotope shift effect. In a 1:1 mixture of H2O and D2O, the 13C\u03b6(\u2013OH) and 13C\u03b6(\u2013OD) peaks are resolved on a carbon spectrum when the residence time of the corresponding hydroxyl proton is longer than the inverse of the deuterium isotope shift effect in hertz; otherwise, they appear as a single averaged peak. However, the observation of such a slight chemical shift is difficult in the case of a uniformly 13C-labeled Tyr ring due to the broad linewidth of the carbon peaks arising from dipole interactions and scalar couplings. To overcome this problem, (2S,3R)-[\u03b2\n2,\u03b5\n1,2-2H3;0,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b6-13C4;15N]-Tyr, \u03b6-SAIL Tyr, was synthesized by SAIL technology. In this Tyr aromatic ring, only the carbon at the \u03b6 position is selectively enriched by 13C, and the ring protons at the \u03b5 positions are deuterated (Figure 9\n). This labeling pattern facilitates efficient magnetization transfer between the 1H\u03b4 protons and the 13C\u03b6 atoms via three-bond scalar couplings, with a size of 7 or 8 Hz. Therefore, the assignment of the 13C\u03b6 atoms can readily be performed by the NOE correlation between 1H\u03b2 and 1H\u03b4 and subsequently by the HSQC correlations between the 1H\u03b4 and 13C\u03b6 atoms. The linewidth of the 13C\u03b6 peak is sharp enough to observe the slight deuterium isotope shift effect from the hydroxyl group. In the application of the extended DEALS method to EPPIb, all three Tyr 13C\u03b6 peaks were observed as sharp lines, with a linewidth as small as 7 or 8 Hz at 40 \u00b0C. When the sample was dissolved in an H2O/D2O mixture, two of the three peaks were doubled, which shows that their hydrogen exchange rate is smaller than the size of the deuterium isotope shift effect (Figure 9). In addition, the exchange rate was quantitatively estimated by performing a 13C-exchange experiment. This extended DEALS method is quite simple to perform and thus will be readily applicable to other cases.",

The essential concept of the SAIL method is to optimize the isotope labeling patterns of amino acids, and thus the proteins labeled with such amino acids, for various steps of protein NMR spectroscopy, such as data acquisition, spectral analysis, structural determination, relaxation analysis and dynamics, and protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013ligand interactions. This chapter described only a small portion of the numerous possible applications to be explored in the future, for which only NMR spectroscopy can be used. Developments in NMR instrumentation, including superconducting magnets as high as 1 GHz and highly sensitive cryogenic probes for various applications, have made NMR spectroscopy an even more important technique to bridge protein structures and their biological functions. In this context, the further optimization of NMR samples based on the SAIL concept will be the most crucial issue for the NMR spectroscopy of biological macromolecules.",
