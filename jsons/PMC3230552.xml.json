The long-range and local RNA-RNA contacts result in tertiary structures that modulate the function of enhancers, promoters and silencers. In addition to the direct interactions within the viral RNA, a wide spectrum of contacts between viral and cellular proteins has been identified that leads to a complex interaction network required for the fine-tuning of virus replication. This network conforms a higher order RNA-protein structure. Nowadays, limited technological procedures have studied compartmentalized aspects of these structures that represent frozen states in a dynamic equilibrium. A widely used strategy to approach RNA structure is the application of predictive algorithms that consider the viral RNA genomes free in solution.8\u201310 Although these theoretical predictions are useful to approach scientific questions, the results withdrawn are necessarily limited to small RNA domains. More refined studies predict RNA structure as it is being synthesized,11 but the real situation, the RNA in contact with viral and cellular proteins, is only addressed using reduced RNA motifs.",

            "text": "RNA viruses are classified according to the nature of their RNA genomes into plus-strand, minus-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. Of these three classes, the most abundant are the plus-stranded RNA viruses. The first replication step in these viruses is the translation of their genome that acts as a viral mRNA. Viral RNA replication takes place in replication complexes generally associated to intracellular membranes. Replication and transcription of several plus-strand RNA viruses require RNA motifs frequently located within the non-coding domains of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome. Plus-stranded RNA viruses replicate their genome through a continuous process that starts with the synthesis of an intermediate full-length minus-strand RNA, which then serves as the template for the asymmetric synthesis of progeny plus-strand genomes. During replication, cis acting replication elements (CREs) residing within the coding sequence,12\u201316 or genome cyclization may be needed.17,18 The cyclization of RNA viral genomes may be mediated by RNA interactions and also by RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, long-range and local RNA-RNA interactions may be mutually exclusive, and may function as molecular switches controlling critical aspects, such as changes between replication, transcription and translation.19\u201322",

Each sgRNA contains a 5\u2032 leader segment connected to a body sequence that is identical to the 3\u2032 end of the genome. CoV transcription requires discontinuous RNA synthesis that involves highly specific long distance interactions promoting a template switch leading to a high frequency recombination.26,27 This process is guided by transcription regulating sequences located at the 3\u2032 end of the leader (TRS-L) and preceding the body (TRS-B) of each gene. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which the discontinuous step in sgRNA synthesis occurs during minus-strand RNA synthesis.3,27\u201331",

A consensus secondary structural model for the first 5\u2032 UTR 140 nt, based on the sequence of nine CoVs representing the three genera, has been proposed.58 In this model, the region comprising the original SL-I contains two stem-loops that within this review have been named SL-Ia and SL-Ib, in order to maintain the original nomenclature proposed in previous reports for the next stem-loops (Fig. 2). Recently, it has been predicted that stem-loops SL-Ia and SL-Ib are structurally conserved in all known CoVs,59 and their structures have been confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in MHV and human CoV (HCoV)-OC43.60\u201362 A general feature of SL-Ia is that it adopts a bipartite structure and, at least in MHV, the upper region of the stem-loop needs to form a double stranded stem to support viral replication. The lower portion of this stem loop has an optimized lability that probably mediates a long-range interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome critical for sgRNA synthesis, but not required for genomic minus-strand synthesis.60 SL-Ib is the most conserved structure in the CoV 5\u2032 UTR. It is composed of a 5 bp stem and a highly conserved loop sequence that adopts a YNMG-type tetra-loop conformation, which has an important role in MHV sgRNA synthesis.61,62",

The existence of this higher-order structure was demonstrated in BCoV by RNase mapping and, similarly to SL-III, the structure rather than the primary sequence was important for DI RNA replication.56 In addition, both SL-III and SL-IV are targets for the binding of viral and cellular proteins, which may play a role in the function of both stem-loops.55,56",

The first structure is a BSL of around 68 nt, beginning immediately downstream of the N gene stop codon, which is essential for MHV viral RNA replication.63,64 Adjacent to the BSL there is a hairping-type pseudoknot (PK) of around 54 nt that overlaps with the BSL in 5 nt and is also required for viral RNA replication.22,65 Despite considerable primary sequence divergence, overlapping BSL and PK sequences are conserved in all genus \u03b2 CoVs and are functionally equivalent.64,66,67 However, genus \u03b1 CoVs contain a highly conserved PK but not a detectable BSL,65 and CoVs from genus \u03b3 have only a conserved and functionally essential BSL.39 These data indicate that CoVs from genera \u03b1 and \u03b3 must have developed alternative mechanisms to those controlling genus \u03b2 CoV replication. 3\u2032-Downstream of the PK there is a hypervariable region (HVR) that is highly divergent both in primary sequence and secondary structure even among closely related CoVs like MHV and BCoV. However, the HVR contains an octanucleotide sequence, 5\u2032-GGA AGA GG-3\u2032, that is universally conserved among CoVs. In the case of MHV, the HVR consists in a complex multiple stem-loop structure expanding the last 160 nt of the genome (Fig. 2).68 Mutational analysis of MHV HVR indicated that this stem-loop was required for DI RNA replication.68 However, further genetic analysis in the context of the full-length genome showed that the deletion of the entire HVR, including the octanucleotide, had only a modest effect on genomic RNA replication in cell culture, although an effect in pathogenesis was observed.69 This discrepancy could be explained by the competitive nature of DI replication that could increase the effect of mutations that only have a moderate impact in the context of the intact genome. Finally, the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail acts as a cis-replication signal for both MHV and BCoV DI RNAs.70 In this study, a correlation between DI RNA replication and the ability to bind poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is reported.",

In addition to the PK described above, a predicted interaction between PK loop 1 (L1) and the 3\u2032 end of the genome has been reported (Fig. 3).75 In the same study, evidence of an interaction of the replicase products nsp8 and nsp9 with the PK is presented. With this information, a model for the initiation of CoV minus-strand RNA synthesis has been proposed. According to this model, in the initial structure of the 3\u2032 UTR, the BSL is folded and the 3\u2032 end of the genome is annealed to the base of PK loop (L1) (Fig. 3A). The formed stem-loop binds to a protein complex that includes nsp8 and nsp9 causing a conformational shift that releases the 3\u2032 end of the genome and disrupts the lower stem of the BSL, leading to the formation of the PK (Fig. 3B). The new conformation is probably recognized by the viral RdRp and associated factors, promoting minus-strand RNA synthesis. The two postulated structures cannot simultaneously fold up, leading to the proposal that the BSL and the PK are components of a molecular switch that regulates different steps of RNA synthesis.22,63",

Similar PK interactions near the 3\u2032 end have been predicted for all known arteriviruses.77 In the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an additional kissing loop between SL-4 and an upstream hairpin located within the N gene is required for replication.78 However, a similar kissing loop interaction has not been predicted in other arteriviruses.

This sgRNA was the most abundant, despite its lower \u0394G value.88 This exception led to the discovery in our laboratory of a cis-acting element upstream of N gene TRS-B that specifically regulated N gene transcription by a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction (Fig. 5).88 The complementarity between the proximal element (pE) located 6 nt upstream of CS-N and the distal element (dE), located 449 nt upstream of TRS-N core sequence (CS-N), was essential to increase the level of sgRNA-N. Interestingly, the \u0394G value of this interaction was more relevant than the pE and dE primary sequences. This novel transcription regulatory mechanism is present in the CoV genus \u03b1, in which the N gene is not the most 3\u2032 one at the end of viral genome. This RNA-RNA interaction most likely promotes an increase in the transcription complex stop at the TRS-B located preceding gene N, during the synthesis of the minus-strand RNA (Fig. 5). This interruption would specifically enhance the frequency of the template switch to the leader during sgRNA N synthesis. This observation is reminiscent of that previously reported by White's group for transcription in tombusviruses by a premature termination mechanism.33,74,89 A similar long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between two genomic RNAs promoting transcription was previously described in red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV).90 In flock house virus (FHV) RNA production is also regulated by an intramolecular RNA-RNA interaction.91",

This type of contact has been described in several RNA virus systems, including CoVs, as a prior step to genome replication and transcription. Previous studies on MHV DI RNA replication, indicate that the last 55 nt of the 3\u2032 end plus the poly(A) tail are sufficient to promote the synthesis of the negative-strand, while both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome are required for plus-strand RNA synthesis.95 This observation led us to postulate an interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome for CoV replication. A direct RNA-RNA interaction between genome ends has been predicted for MHV, TGEV and severe and acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) using computer programs designed to analyze full-length genomes.96,97 Genetic evidence supporting a 5\u2032-3\u2032 end cross-talk that stimulates sgRNA synthesis60 came from a study on MHV, in which it was suggested that the base of stem loop SL-Ia, located at the 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 2), mediates a long range interaction with the 3\u2032 end. In addition, experimental evidence reported for MHV98 and TGEV (Almazan F, Galan C and Enjuanes L, unpublished results) suggests that the interaction between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends may also be mediated by RNA-protein interactions as described below.",

In MHV, belonging to CoV genus \u03b2, polypyrimidine-tract binding (PTB) protein, also known as hnRNP I, binds pentanucleotide repeats of leader TRS, located in the 5\u2032 UTR (nt 56\u2013112). Deletion of these leader repeats in DI RNAs significantly inhibited RNA transcription, suggesting that PTB might be involved in transcription regulation.166 Functional studies showed delayed virus production and reduction of viral RNA synthesis in MHV infected cells overexpressing PTB. This protein interacts with viral N protein both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a possible contribution to the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation.167 PTB also binds to the TRS-L sequences at the 5\u2032 end of TGEV genome106 (Sola I and Enjuanes L, unpublished results). hnRNP A1 specifically binds to MHV RNA consensus sequences present in viral genome negative RNAs cTRS-L and cTRS-B, complementary to TRS-L and TRS-B RNA motifs, respectively.168 Another member of hnRNP family, SYNCRIP or hnRNP Q, binds to MHV 5\u2032 UTR or to its complementary sequence c5\u2032 UTR.169 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also identified in association with TGEV TRS-L (Table 1). In addition, the knockdown of the GAPDH gene produced a positive effect on CoV-replication both in a TGEV replicon and full-length infectious virus systems, suggesting a potential role in the balance of cellular factors that positively influence TGEV RNA synthesis.106 This hypothesis is supported by the formation of a complex including GAPDH, the bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), hnRNP Q and the ribosomal protein L13a, in an inflammatory response.170",

Transition between two structural conformations may regulate the switch between essential activities within virus cycle. Future challenges in this field rely on the development of novel methodologies to study RNA structure formation in vivo as a consequence of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in the cellular environment. In addition, in vitro reconstitution of replication-transcription complexes with defined composition will be critical to analyze the contribution of viral and cell factors to RNA synthesis.",
