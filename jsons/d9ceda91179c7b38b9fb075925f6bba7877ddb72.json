Macrophages free within the ventricular lumen often were strongly positive, suggesting that immunohistochemical staining of cells from CSF samples may provide valuable antemortem diagnostic information. However, the utility of this procedure would be limited to those cases with cellular CSE A previous report of immunohistochemical staining using cat ascites-derived polyclonal anti-FIPV and BALB/c mouse-derived anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus monoclonal antibodies described only 1 cat with positive staining in monocytes in blood vessels in the choroid plexus.Z1 Positive staining of a few lymphocytes in the present study was an unexpected finding.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "All FIPV-infected cats (neurologic and control) were PCR positive in at least 1 tissue, whereas only 67% of cats with apparent neurologic FIP were PCR positive in brain tissue. The most likely explanation for this was the patchy distribution of virus in the brains, as shown on immunohistochemical staining. PCR sensitivity could be increased by sampling brain tissue from multiple sites and pooling, but this approach is impractical if brain tissue must also be preserved for histopathology. Nested PCR for herpesvirus DNA in the CSF of patients with neurologic disease detected only 62% of cases of cytomegalovirus-associated encephalopathy.2' However, PCR to detect herpes simplex virus DNA in CSF of experimentally inoculated mice was very sensitive.2z Clumped small foci with low virus load in the brain could account for the discrepancy in sensitivity of PCR on brain compared with PCR on abdominal tissues. Abdominal tissues can usually be correctly identified postmortem as containing virus by the presence of gross lesions, whereas brain tissue usually must be sampled blindly, because gross lesions often are inapparent. Histopathologic examination revealed extensive granulomatous inflammation in some FIP-affected brains, even though monoclonal antibody staining failed to demonstrate much virus in these lesions. These results agree with findings in murine coronavirus strain JHM, which produces demyelinating lesions in infected mice.34 Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice cleared virus from the brain but developed severe paralysis and demyelination. In contrast, SCID mice had persistent viral loads but no neurologic impairment or detectable lesions, suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis similar to that of FIF! T-lymphocytes (CD4' and CD8') were required for viral clearance, whereas B cells and other cells participated in demyelination. Numerous other infectious, neoplastic, and immunologic diseases can produce meningitis, encephalitis, and neurologic lesions in cats, although none are as frequent in occurrence as F I P Some of the more common infectious causes include feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency virus infection,25 rabies,j6 pse~dorabies,~' canine distemper,jK and Toxoplasma gondii.j9 Rare diagnoses include paramyxovirus-like disease:\" borna-virus-induced nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis,\" Neospora caninum,4z Sarcocystis spp.,\" fungal infections,' and feline spongiform encephalopathy.Js Postmortem differentiation of FIPV infection from other infectious causes of meningitis and encephalitis is based upon the presence of vascular and superficially oriented microgranulomas. The immunohistochemical stain described in the present study was useful for cases requiring additional confirmation. Antemortem FIP diagnosis was facilitated by CSF serology, PCR, and MRI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utility of MRI, PCR, and serology in the diagnosis of neurologic FII? Many cats in this study had focal, relatively small amounts of virus in brain tissue, despite sometimes extensive histopathological changes. Additional research should be directed at understanding the feline immunologic response to FIPV. Results of such studies will clarify the nature of both viral and host adaptations.
