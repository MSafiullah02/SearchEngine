Methods: A model using the Polynomial Regression with cubic adjustments of the number of days of contagion, demographic density, city population and climatic factors was designed to explain the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. Main results: It was evidenced that temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19, but on a very small scale. With a simulation of 30 days of contagion, a variation of -0.9% was found for each increase of 1\u00b0C. Conclusion: Temperature, despite being an intervening factor in the variation in the number of COVID-19 cases, has a reduced magnitude effect. Cities with higher temperatures don't necessarily it's more protected from the SARS-CoV-2 than those with lower temperatures, however, strong statistical significance was found, this relationship deserves to be investigated in other tests with longer time series, wide and with especially non-linear data adjustments.",

The authors also pointed out that a variant similar to SARS-CoV-2, the influenza virus, was affected by the climate, today it is unknown whether COVID-19 follows the same scalability (LOWEN, 2007; BARRECA & SHIMSHACK, 2012) . Bukhari and Jameel (2020) found some important findings in their data, for example, they made an analysis of the climatic patterns of the regions affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide until March 22, 2020, with 83% of the tests being performed in non-tropical countries (30N and above) and 90% of SARS-CoV-2 cases were recorded in the same countries within a temperature range of 3 \u00b0C to 17 \u00b0 C.",

Therefore, although currently available data is distorted by minimal per capita testing in many tropical countries, it is possible that the climate plays a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which would warrant further investigation. However, with the analysis of the database used in this research, the results were not able to demonstrate with statistical significance the influence of climatic variation in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and that it would not spread in humid and hot regions with the same speed.",

It was found that in the single factor model of the highest temperature group, each 1\u00baC increase in the minimum temperature led to a 0.86% reduction in the cumulative number of cases. Thus, the study concluded that, to some extent, temperature can impact COVID-19 transmission and there may be a better temperature for viral transmission, which may partly explain why the first explosion occurred in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with the lowest temperature in the world adopt the most stringent control measures to avoid future reversals (WANG ET AL., 2020).",

Therefore, cities with higher temperatures may not necessarily present themselves as more protected from the SARS-CoV-2 than those with lower temperatures.
