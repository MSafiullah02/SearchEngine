RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCRbased methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (\"swab-to-RT-LAMP\"). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a diagnostic and validation procedure to detect and record the outcome of RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel. Finally, we propose applications of RT-LAMP based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

This can lead to a high burden on the health care system resulting in a situation where not all patients can receive adequate treatment. Further, due to limited capacities, only people with symptoms are usually being tested, although recent studies confirmed that many SARS-CoV-2 carriers are asymptomatic (Mizumoto et al., 2020 , Arons et al., 2020 .

Samples with potential template molecules are added to the reaction and incubated for 20-60 minutes at a constant temperature (e.g. 65\u00b0C). The oligos act as primers for the reverse transcriptase and additional oligos for the DNA polymerase that are designed so the DNA products loop back at their ends. These in turn serve as self-priming templates for the DNA polymerase. In the presence of a few RNA template molecules, a chain reaction is set in motion, which then runs until the added reagents (e.g., dNTPs) are used up.",

Previously, RT-LAMP assays have been proposed for diagnostic detection of other RNA viruses, such as e.g. influenza (Ito et al., 2006) . Also, several preprints demonstrate the use of isothermal DNA amplification to detect small amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The majority of these studies used in vitro transcribed short fragments of the viral genomic RNA (Yu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; El-Tholoth et al., 2020) and showed a detection limit of somewhere between 10-100 RNA molecules per reaction.",

We prepared and tested two primer sets for different RNA sections of the SARS CoV-2 genome, namely Zhang et al's set N-A (targeting N gene) and their set 1a-A (targeting ORF 1a gene) ( Table 1 , Materials and Methods). Figure 2 shows that the oligo set for the N gene is capable of detecting 100 in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA molecules in a test reaction with 1 microliter (\u00b5l) of RNA solution. To put this into perspective: W\u00f6lfel et al. (2020) found that COVID-19 patients showed up to 7\u00d710 8 RNA copies per throat swab in the first week after infection. Assuming a quantitative extraction of all RNA molecules in the sample, this should equal a concentration of up to several million RNA molecules per 1 \u00b5l (a) Defined numbers of in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA molecules of N gene were added to the reaction and incubated at 65 \u00b0C. At indicated times, samples were taken out of the heating block, cooled on ice to stop the reaction, and photographed. (b) 5 \u00b5l of the RT-LAMP reaction product (after 60 min) were analysed on a 2% agarose gel. The typical band pattern of a successful RT-LAMP reaction was visible in the samples with 100 or more RNA molecules, i.e., in those samples that showed a color change after 30 minutes. Upon prolonged incubation at 65\u00b0C, in the case of the colorimetric assay for timepoints > 30-35 min, the negative control becomes yellowish and non-specific DNA smear appears when loaded on a gel. This is a well known problem with RT-LAMP (Gadkar et al., 2018) .",

To visualize the RT-LAMP reaction, the photo-function of a normal mobile phone is sufficient (Figure 3a ). To quantify the reaction, the difference in absorbance (\u0394OD) of the samples at 434 nm and 560 nm (corresponding to the absorbance maxima of the two forms of phenol red that is used in the RT-LAMP assay as pH-sensitive dye) was measured. For measurement a Tecan Spark Cyto plate scanner was used, but any plate scanner that allows OD measurements at different wavelengths can be used. \u0394OD values were compared in a scatter plot with the CT values of the standard RT-qPCR of the hospital laboratory's routine diagnostic pipeline (which used primers against the E gene) (Figure 3b ). The used RT-LAMP enzyme mix contains oligonucleotide-based aptamers that function as reversible inhibitors for the RTx (reverse transcription xenopolymerase) and Bst 2.0 (strand-displacing polymerase) enzyme present in the reaction. This allowed stopping of the reaction at different timepoints by cooling the samples on ice and inspecting the color visually ( Figure 3a ) or by measuring \u0394OD at a given time point of incubation at 65\u00b0C (e.g. \u0394OD30min) ( Figure 3c ). We noted that interruption of the reaction by cooling on ice for extended periods of up to 20 min is possible without loss of sensitivity. Usually the color change is detected in positive samples at timepoints > 10 min, and all positive samples have changed at 30 min. Further incubation led to color changes in negative samples. Inspection of the color curves revealed a wide gap between positive and negative samples, indicating that measurement in the time window from 25 to 30 min yields very robust results: negative samples had an absorbance difference below 0 and positive an absorbance difference well above +0.3 (Figure 3b ).",

LAMP reactions yield DNA products of heterogeneous structure which is why we needed to use a sequencing strategy that is as unbiased as possible as well as fully scalable in order to allow the analysis of the large number of samples involved. To this end, we established LAMP-sequencing, a fully scalable multiplexed sequencing strategy using Tn5 tagmentation. This allowed us to enrich LAMP-specific amplicons without selecting for a certain subset of LAMP products. We used a set of 96 barcoded adapters to barcode the RT-LAMP reaction products in 96-well plates. These adapters also contained unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for quantification purposes (Kiviola et al., 2011) . After tagmentation, the barcoded fragments were pooled and size-selected by bead purification to remove excess adapters. A second set of barcoded primers was then used to amplify the pooled tagmented RT-LAMP fragments ( Figure 5a ). Analysis of the sequences allowed us to unambiguously identify for each well whether the RT-LAMP reaction yielded a product that incorporated the viral genomic sequence.",

LAMP-sequencing is directly dependent on the RT-LAMP reaction. We observed two negative samples in the sequencing which had scored positive in the RT-LAMP reaction, indicating that these were false positives of the colorimetric RT-LAMP assay (compare Figure 4a and Figure 5a ). Overall, we could show that LAMP-sequencing can serve as a powerful validation tool for a large number of RT-LAMP assays in high-throughput. In addition, LAMP-sequencing confirmed our high threshold for positive RT-LAMP samples as spurious amplification in some RT-LAMP samples did result in a weak colorimetric shift but not in detectable virus sequences.",

We used a plate of 96 barcoded adaptors that included unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for Tn5 tagmentation of the RT-LAMP products for each 96-well RT-LAMP reaction. Tagmentation involves one pipetting step per RT-LAMP reaction plate, before the samples from each plate can be pooled. After purification and size selection of tagmented fragments, one PCR per plate is used to introduce a second barcode, one for each plate. Afterwards, the samples were analyzed using an Illumina NextSeq 550 run. (b) Comparison of RT-LAMP, RT-qPCR, and sequencing results for all samples detected during sequencing. The left panel shows the results for a total of ten plates, comprising the same plates as shown in Figure 4 . The sequencing outcome is color-coded: black if a substantial number of reads contained SARS-CoV-2 sequence, white otherwise. While the RT-LAMP test was scored after 30 minutes of incubation, the sequencing was performed after the samples had been incubated for 40 minutes (which yields the spurious LAMP reactions in negative samples, as shown by the high \u0394OD value for many of them).

We next titrated a positive COVID-19 sample (CT=21) into control specimens from COVID-19 negative test subjects, alone or in the presence of 0.1% SDS. This SDS concentration was determined empirically to not disturb a subsequent RT-LAMP assay, when diluted 1:20 in the RT-LAMP mixture. The mixed extracts were then used for RT-LAMP, without ( Figure 7a ) and with (Figure 7b ) heat treatment. In the absence of SDS, the viral RNA from the positive sample could still be detected at a dilution of 1:4096, while it was not detected at all in the presence of SDS, indicating that SDS leads to the release of RNAses and that the RNAs detected in the RT-LAMP assay are susceptible to degradation by these RNAses.

This might affect the interpretability of the measurement at 30 min (\u0394OD30min). We investigated how this pH-shift influences the RT-LAMP assay. For three plates, the data acquired for the RT-LAMP assay also included measurements for time point 10 min (\u0394OD10min). We plotted the change of the \u0394OD between time points 10 min and 30 min (i.e. the difference \u0394OD30min -\u0394OD10min, corresponding to the slope of the lines) versus \u0394OD30min (Figure 9b ).

However, Proteinase K has the same temperature optimum as the RT-LAMP reaction (65\u00b0C) and heat inactivation is not 100% efficient, even when incubating at 95\u00b0C for 10 min (see FAQ pages on www.qiagen.com), thus exposing the enzymes in the RT-LAMP reaction to unpredictable proteolytic influences. Rabe and Cepko (2020) suggest to use cheap silika preparation and novel sample inactivation protocols to enrich the RNA prior to LAMP, which however would come at the expense of complicating the simple swab-to-RT-LAMP workflow. Finally, our analysis found that a short heat treatment of 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, which poses minimal additional handling steps, does not destroy the RNA but rather stabilised it in the inactivated specimen, and improved the sensitivity and specificity of the swab-to-RT-LAMP assay (Figure 8 ). The heat likely helps to homogenize the sample, inactivate RNAses, and to break up the viral capsid to release the viral RNA.",

This is likely the bottleneck of the colorimetric RT-LAMP assay, which we found to work optimally with an input of 1 \u03bcl into the reaction. This corresponds to only 10% of the input used for the RT-qPCR. Some clinical samples contain high levels of contaminants which can lead to acidification of the reaction independent of the presence of a template RNA if too much sample is added (see also Supplementary Comments and Discussion for a detailed list of considerations and observations).",

These two peaks from phenol red are strongly changing during the acidification of the reaction (434 nm absorbance is increased, 560 nm absorbance is decreased), so we were subtracting the absorbance at 560 nm from the one at 434 nm to get a good readout of the color change.",

The relevant primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. In detail, transposon adapters containing well-defining barcodes and UMIs were annealed by mixing 25 \u00b5M of oligos (P5-UMI-xi501\u20265096-ME.fw, Tn5hY-Rd2-Wat-SC3) in 5 \u00b5M Tris-HCl (pH 8), incubating at 99 \u00b0C for 5 min, and slowly cooling down to 20 \u00b0C within 15 min in a thermocycler. Transposons were assembled by mixing 100 ng/\u00b5l Tn5(E54K, L372P) transposase (purified according to Hennig et al., 2018) with 1.25 \u00b5M annealed adapters in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubating the reaction for 1 h at 23 \u00b0C. Tagmentation was carried out by mixing 1.2 \u00b5l RT-LAMP product (~200 ng DNA) with freshly prepared tagmentation buffer (10 mM TAPS, pH 8.5; 5 mM MgCl2, 10 % (v/v) dimethylformamide) and 1.5 \u00b5l loaded transposase, and the reaction was incubated at 55 \u00b0C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of 0.033 %. Tagmented DNA of each plate was pooled and size-selected using a two-step AMPureXP bead (Beckman Coulter) purification to target for fragments between 300 and 600 bp. First, 50 \u00b5l pooled reaction was mixed with 50 \u00b5l water and bound to 55 \u00b5l beads to remove large fragments. To further remove small fragments, the supernatant of this reaction was added to 25 \u00b5l fresh beads and further purified using two washes with 80 % Ethanol before the samples were finally eluted in 10 \u00b5l 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. One PCR per plate with 1 \u00b5l of the eluate and RT-LAMP-specific and Tn5-adapter-specific primers (P7nxt-GeneN-A-LBrc and P7-xi701..16, P5.fw) was performed using NEBNext Q5 HotStart polymerase (New England BioLabs) with two cycles at 62 \u00b0C for annealing and 90 seconds elongation, followed by two cycles at 65 \u00b0C for annealing and 90 seconds elongation, and 13 cycles at 72 \u00b0C annealing and 90 seconds elongation. All PCR reactions were combined and 19 % of this pool was size-selected for 400-550 bp using a 2 % agarose/TAE gel and column purification (Macherey-Nagel). The final sequencing library was quantified by qPCR (NEB) and sequenced with a paired-end sequencing run on a NextSeq 550 machine (Illumina) with 20 % phiX spike-in and 136 cycles for the first read, 11 cycles to read the 11 nt long plateindex (i7) and 20 cycles to read the 11 nt-long well-index (i5) and the 9 nt-long UMI.",

The buffer capacity of the WarmStart Colorimetric RT-LAMP 2X Master Mix (DNA & RNA) from NEB (M1800) is very low in order to allow a color change as a function of synthesized DNA. High sample volumina, buffered samples and compounds influencing the buffer capacity of the reaction can yield false positive or false negative results. 2. The LAMP reaction can yield non-specific products which induce a pH shift; these appear with a delay of approx 10 min and thus measurements at time points > 35 min are prone to contain increasing numbers of false positives. 3. Best results were obtained with freshly prepared RT-LAMP master mixes that were kept on ice in a closed tube prior to the addition of the sample 4. Colorimetric RT-LAMP mastermixes are not very stable. Old master mixes (set up with primers) are characterized by a color change in the negative control sample already at the time point 30 min, or even earlier. This yields false positive results. Freshly prepared mastermixes can be stored maximally 14-18 hours at -20\u00b0C. Longer storage also yields false positive results. 5. Exposure to the atmosphere (open lid) leads to a slow drop in pH, presumably due to acidification by atmospheric CO2. Pipetting of RT-LAMP mixes into 96 well plates needs to be done immediately before use. Keep plates on ice while adding the samples. Pipette carefully and avoid bubbles which, if they burst, could contaminate adjacent samples.",

When using 96 well plates, pipette carefully and absolutely avoid bubbles which, if they burst, could contaminate adjacent samples. 12. Successful RT-LAMP reactions contain large quantities of DNA that are a perfect template for the assay. Therefore, after the reaction the tubes should not be opened and be carefully disposed of. 13. Analysis of RT-LAMP reactions for gel electrophoresis requires that the tubes are opened. This should be done in a well separated location and using equipment that is not shared with work benches where RT-LAMP reactions are set up or where patient samples are manipulated.",
