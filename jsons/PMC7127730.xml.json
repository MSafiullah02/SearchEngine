            "text": "The New World alphaviruses, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), can infect humans and potentially cause encephalitic disease (Weaver and Reisen, 2010). In 2013, Latin America recorded multiple confirmed cases of New World alphavirus infections with a total of 19 patients hospitalized for encephalitis. Among them, 3 patients died, 1 of whom had confirmed VEE (Carrera et al., 2013). Owing to their propensity to cause naturally-occurring disease, these alphaviruses have been classified as emerging infectious agents. The New World alphaviruses have the potential to be extremely infectious by the aerosol route and have therefore been explored previously as potential bioweapons (Zacks and Paessler, 2010). For this reason, VEEV and EEEV are classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as Category B select agents. There are currently no FDA-approved therapeutic candidates or vaccines for the protection of humans from New World alphavirus infections. The attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV is used to vaccinate select at-risk personnel; however, TC-83 has concerns regarding safety and is considered to be a reactogenic vaccine (Barrett and Stanberry, 2009). Around 40% of all vaccinees have developed disease with some symptoms typical to that of natural VEE infection (Volkova et al., 2008). Therefore, there are ongoing efforts to establish a more effective and safer vaccine, some of which include vaccine candidates derived from the V3526 attenuated strain of VEEV (Fine et al., 2010, Martin et al., 2010, Paessler and Weaver, 2009, Sharma et al., 2011). FDA-approved antiviral therapies for RNA viruses, such as ribavirin, have been ineffective against VEEV and WEEV (Canonico et al., 1984), further highlighting the importance of new therapeutic approaches as medical countermeasures against New World alphaviruses.",

            "text": "Viruses rely on their host cell for the establishment of a productive infectious cycle. Viruses are obligate pathogens that are known to modulate and utilize many host events, including host signal-transduction mechanisms. A deeper understanding of the dynamics of the interactions between the host and the pathogen can help in the identification of novel targets for therapeutics. For example, many alphaviruses have developed the ability to interfere with the induction of the host cell antiviral response (Burke et al., 2009, Garmashova et al., 2007). Animal models have also revealed changes in gene expression in VEEV-infected mouse brains (Sharma et al., 2008). We have demonstrated that host kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) and the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK-\u03b2), were modified upon VEEV infection (Kehn-Hall et al., 2012, Amaya et al., 2014). Targeting these kinases with small molecule inhibitors resulted in a decrease of viral replication. Such observations underscore the potential of host-based candidates as therapeutic targets for development of antivirals against New World alphaviruses. The advantages conferred by host-based therapeutics include a decreased potential for the development of resistant strains and an increased probability of broad-spectrum applicability to treat many viral indications. The concerns around host-based therapeutics include a low threshold for toxicity and hence, a requirement of a stringent analysis of inhibitor induced toxicity profiles in the host.",

            "text": "The host MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), responds to stress events including infection by directing multiple downstream events like inflammation and cell death (Hong et al., 2009, Hu et al., 2004, Xing et al., 2010). ERK exists as ERK1 and ERK2 (hereafter referred to collectively as ERK1/2), both of which have a central position in the MAPK cascade, downstream in RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal transduction (Roskoski, 2012a, Roskoski, 2012b). Briefly, RAF kinases act by phosphorylating and therefore activating MEK1 and MEK2 (collectively referred to as MEK1/2). MEK1/2 have dual specificity for ERK1/2, phosphorylating first at tyrosine and then threonine sites in the activation segments of ERK1/2, causing subsequent activation (Roskoski, 2012a, Roskoski, 2012b). Activated ERK1/2 act as protein-serine/threonine kinases, phosphorylating more than 150 cytosolic and nuclear substrates (Yoon and Seger, 2006, Shaul and Seger, 2007). ERK1/2 form an activated dimer and translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate transcription factors regulating gene transcription (Chuderland and Seger, 2005, Parra et al., 2005).",

Specifically, publications have implicated the ERK signaling pathway in the regulation of viral replication and gene expression for Coxsackievirus B3 (Luo et al., 2002), human cytomegalovirus (Boldogh et al., 1990, Johnson et al., 2001), Junin virus (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2014), human immunodeficiency type 1 (Furler and Uittenbogaart, 2010, Jacqu\u00e9 et al., 1998), coronavirus (Cai et al., 2007), and influenza virus (Pleschka et al., 2001). Of particular relevance to our studies, it was reported that Borna disease virus, an RNA virus with high neurotropism, also manipulates the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in vitro and appears to be essential for viral spread (Hans et al., 2001, Planz et al., 2001). Here we demonstrate that VEEV infection of human astrocytoma cells results in the phosphorylation of multiple target proteins in the ERK signaling cascade. Using a small molecule inhibitor of ERK, Ag-126, we demonstrate that ERK1/2 phosphorylation plays an important role in VEEV multiplication in infected cells. We provide data which suggest that early and late events in the viral infectious cycle are susceptible to ERK1/2 inhibitors. We extend our studies to the virulent strains of VEEV, WEEV and EEEV, and demonstrate that ERK1/2 signaling is a broad-spectrum requirement for New World alphaviruses for the establishment of a productive infectious cycle.",

            "text": "Our previous studies have indicated that host kinases including IKK-\u03b2 and GSK-3\u03b2 were modulated in VEEV-infected cells and that inhibition of these kinases with small molecule inhibitors resulted in decreased viral multiplication (Amaya et al., 2014, Kehn-Hall et al., 2012). We reported in our IKK-\u03b2 study that multiple components, which collectively constitute the NFkB response (IKK-\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b1, p65), were phosphorylated as part of a cascade activation process (Amaya et al., 2014). Based on our previous lines of evidence, we hypothesized that VEEV infection will activate other host phospho-signaling cascades in infected cells and inhibition of specific events in those cascades will have an effect on VEEV multiplication. We utilized a reverse phase protein microarray (RPPA) approach to identify changes in phospho-signaling cascades in VEEV-infected cells. We have successfully used this approach in previous studies to identify host events that are altered in virus-infected cells (Popova et al., 2010a, Popova et al., 2010b, Wulfkuhle et al., 2006). The RPPA analysis was carried out as described previously (Popova et al., 2010a, Popova et al., 2010b). Briefly, U87MG cells were either mock infected or infected with TC-83, the attenuated strain of VEEV. Infections with TC-83 as indicated throughout the manuscript involved exposure of the cells to the virus for one hour unless otherwise indicated. We are referring to as the time frame during which infection was allowed to happen after which the viral overlay was removed. The antibodies used for the analysis included a diverse range of signaling cascades such as growth factor signaling, Akt signaling, NFkB signaling, and ERK signaling. Fold differences in phosphorylation of the candidate proteins seen in infected cells were calculated in comparison with those in the uninfected cells. We observed that multiple signaling molecules, which are part of the RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK signaling cascade, were phosphorylated in VEEV-infected cells. The schematic of the ERK signaling cascade is shown in\nFig. 1A. The RPPA analysis revealed that levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were 2-fold higher in infected cells when compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 1B). The data also indicated that the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 upstream activator MEK1/2 was also increased (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, many downstream targets of ERK1/2 including Elk-1 (Cruzalegui et al., 1999), p65 (Carter and Hunninghake, 2000), and Stat-1 (Zhang et al., 2004) were activated in infected cells (Fig. 1B). Cumulatively, preliminary RPPA data indicated that the ERK signaling cascade was activated in VEEV-infected cells.",

We carried out infections of U87MG cells and collected total protein lysates at multiple time points between 5 min after the removal of initial viral inoculum (referred to hence forth as the infection period) and 6 h after the infection period. The lysates were subsequently fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), unphosphorylated (total) ERK1/2, and \u03b2-actin. The results showed an increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the infected cells after the infection period (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 7). Levels of p-ERK1/2 remained consistently higher in the infected samples than the mock samples for the entire time course which distinguished the phospho-profile of ERK1/2 in infected cells from the mock-infected control cells (Fig. 1C). We performed additional validation experiments of the RPPA data by subjecting our protein lysates to Western blot using antibodies against p-p90RSK and \u03b2-actin. The activation profile of p90RSK paralleled that of ERK1/2 and agreed with the data obtained by the RPPA process (Fig. 1D). To quantify levels of p-ERK1/2 in the TC-83 infected samples, three independent experiments were performed and the fold changes over the mock samples in each experiment averaged. Levels of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 remained at around a minimum of a 2-fold increase over the mock throughout the time course (Fig. 1E). Our analysis of total ERK1/2 levels did not indicate any significant differences between mock and infected samples, thus indicating the phosphorylation event to be independent of total protein levels. Cumulatively, the data included in Fig. 1 suggest that infection of U87MGs with the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV results in an activation of the ERK signaling cascade and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at early time points after infection.",

To define the role of ERK1/2 in TC-83 infection, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, tyrphostin Ag-126, was employed. Tyrphostin Ag-126 (\u03b1-cyano-[3-hydroxy-4nitro]cinnamonitrile), has been reported as a cell-permeable inhibitor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synthesis of tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and nitric oxide (NOS) in murine peritoneal macrophages (Novogrodsky et al., 1994). It also blocks LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK and its substrates and reduces the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in the lungs of rats treated with carrageenan (Chatterjee et al., 2003). Before we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of Ag-126, we determined the toxicity profile of Ag-126. U87MG cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 24 h later, increasing concentrations of Ag-126 were added to wells in triplicate. DMSO was added as a negative solvent control. The cells were maintained in the presence of Ag-126 for 24 h after which viable cells were quantified by measuring luminescence in a Cell-Titer-Glo assay. The assay results showed that the inhibitor was non-toxic to U87MG cells when compared to the DMSO treated cells at the concentration range tested (\nFig. 2A). For all our subsequent experiments, we have used Ag-126 at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M unless otherwise indicated.",

The cells were then incubated for up to 24 h at 37 \u00b0C after which the supernatants were collected to quantify infectious viral titers using plaque assays. Controls included infected cells treated with DMSO. As the concentration of Ag-126 treatment increased, the amount of viral inhibition increased, demonstrating a dose-dependent response (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the inhibitory effects of Ag-126 were dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI), U87MG cells were pretreated for 2 h with Ag-126 or DMSO alone and infected with TC-83 at three different MOIs (0.1, 0.5, 1). The cells were incubated for 24 h as described previously and the supernatants were collected for quantification of infectious viral titers.

At 8 h post-infection (8 hpi), VEEV capsid protein can be detected in the treated cells; however, the amount of capsid protein detected at this time point in the untreated cells was higher in the untreated cells (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 1 and 2). The difference between the amounts of capsid protein produced in Ag-126 treated versus untreated cells was more prominent at the 24 h time point (compare lanes 3 and 4). While we were unable to detect the VEEV E2 glycoprotein (GP) at 8 hpi, we could detect fairly robust expression of glycoprotein in TC-83 infected, untreated cells when compared to treated cells at the 24-hour time point (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4). We quantified the differences of treated and untreated cells at the 24-hour time point in two independent experiments and found that Ag-126 treatment modestly reduced capsid expression, and had a greater effect on GP expression (Fig. 2D). This indicated that decrease in viral structural protein levels by Ag-126 treatment may be partially responsible for decreased viral titers. We also conducted Western blot analysis on infected and Ag-126 treated and infected cell lysates to ensure that Ag-126 treatment did indeed inhibit phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Using antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), unphosphorylated (total) ERK1/2, and \u03b2-actin, we were able to document a decrease in the amount of phosphorylated ERKs at all time points tested in the presence of Ag-126 (Fig. 2E).",

We then determined if Ag-126 could inhibit TC-83 multiplication in Vero cells by pretreating cells with Ag-126 for 2 h and then infecting with TC-83. Infectious titers were measured by plaque assays at 24 h post the infection period. The result shown in Fig. 3B indicates that Ag-126 could inhibit TC-83 even in a permissive cell line such as Vero cells, albeit, the extent of inhibition being lesser than what we observed in U87MG cells. Cumulatively, our data suggested that at nontoxic concentrations, Ag-126 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreased viral protein expression and negatively influenced TC-83 multiplication in infected cells.",

Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by small molecule inhibitors affected nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 (Roskoski, 2012a). Therefore, to confirm that Ag-126 treatment indeed resulted in decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in U87MG cells, we investigated the intracellular p-ERK1/2 localization during VEEV infection in the presence or absence of Ag-126 at different time points using confocal microscopy as described previously (Amaya et al., 2014). Briefly, U87MG cells were seeded in 8-well chambered slides and infected with TC-83 virus. At 6 and 24 h after the infection period, the cells were fixed and probed with antibodies to ERK1/2 and VEEV capsid. At 6 h, nuclear enrichment of p-ERK1/2 was observed in 71% of cells that were infected with TC-83 (\nFig. 4A). We defined nuclear enrichment by a visual assessment, in which p-ERK1/2 was localized to the nucleus. In contrast, 38% of mock cells showed enrichment, whereas the Ag-126 treated cells had 22% enrichment. Therefore, treatment with Ag-126 resulted in a decrease in nuclear p-ERK1/2, thus attesting to an inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. This observation added support to the data presented in Fig. 2E.",

It would be more informative to determine if the overall replication kinetics of the virus was impacted by Ag-126 treatment. To this end, U87MG cells were pre-treated with Ag-126 for 2 h or DMSO alone as a control. Cells were infected with TC-83, supernatants were collected at multiple time points (3, 6, 16, 24 and 30 h post-infection), and plaque assays were performed. The results, as shown in\nFig. 5A, demonstrate an overall decrease in viral replication kinetics that could be clearly observed as early as 6 h post the infection period and was not exacerbated over subsequent time points. We performed time-of-addition experiments in an attempt to identify specific time frames in the infectious cycle when the inhibition by Ag-126 could be detected. Cells were treated with either Ag-126 or DMSO alone, at the indicated times (Fig. 5B). All supernatants were collected at 24 h and quantified for infectious viral titers. We observed that when cells were pretreated with Ag-126 two hours before infection (2 h pre), robust inhibition was apparent. While Ag-126 continued to be inhibitory when added 2 hpi (2 h post), the extent of inhibition was not as robust as the 2-hour pretreatment. When the drug was added at 4 hpi, the inhibitory potential decreased (Fig. 5C). We also observed a modest, but statistically significant reduction in titers when drug was added at 8 h post the infection period, which could potentially implicate Ag-126 in late events as well. However, it is unclear whether the apparent inhibition seen at the 8 h time point was due to late events in the first round of viral multiplication, or the early events of the second round of multiplication. Cumulatively, our experimentation with the addition of Ag-126 at multiple time points after the infection period revealed that Ag-126 may affect viral multiplication at early and late time frames of the infectious process. The fact that the pretreatment strategy was the most efficacious in our hands could also imply that the longer the drug is available in the system, the greater the extent of inhibition observed.",

We carried out this experiment using VEEV glycoprotein antiserum and analyzed the distribution of the glycoprotein in the ER and golgi at 1, 2, 4 and 6 h post the infection period. In our hands, we were able to detect glycoprotein in the ER at the 1 h time point and the ER signal steadily decreased during the time course of analysis (\nFig. 6A and B). We were not able to observe any distinct colocalization of glycoprotein with the golgi apparatus within the time frames included in our study (Fig. 6A). In the presence of Ag-126, we noticed that the glycoprotein signal in the ER was reduced at the 1 h time point and the difference in the ER signal between the treated and untreated cells increased by the 2 and 4 h time points suggesting that Ag-126 may have an effect on the ER localization of VEEV glycoprotein.",

As a first step, we assessed the toxicity of the compound in U87MG cells and found no loss of viability at 1 \u03bcM concentration of the compound (\nFig. 7A). Treatments greater than or equal to 5 \u03bcM, however, had a noticeable level of toxicity. Therefore, we decided to proceed with 0.1 \u03bcM treatments for analysis of viral replication kinetics when ERK was activated prior to infection. To validate that Ceramide C6 treatment was activating ERK1/2 under our experimental conditions, we collected whole cell protein lysates at multiple time points in the presence or absence of Ceramide C6 and performed Western blot analysis. The data indicated that Ceramide C6 treatment increased the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 at 0.1 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM treatments. Addition of 1 \u03bcM Ceramide C6 resulted in a earlier activation of ERK signaling (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 1 and 6), than 0.1 \u03bcM treatment confirming that Ceramide C6 does indeed activate ERK1/2 signaling in this cell type.",

At 16 hpi, where we saw the greatest difference of infectious viral titers, we isolated intracellular RNA and subjected it to qRT-PCR analysis. The genomic copies did not show any noticeable differences in the viral RNA accumulation in the cells dependent on Ceramide C6 treatment (Fig. 7E). The supernatants that corresponded to the 16 h time point that was analyzed by the PCR method was subjected to plaque assay to quantify infectious virus in those same supernatant samples. Interestingly, the plaque assays revealed an increase in the infectious viral titers in the presence of Ceramide C6, although viral RNA levels were similar to the DMSO control (Fig. 7E).",

Our earlier experiments using host-based inhibitors of TC-83 multiplication have alluded to the possibility of increased survival of infected cells when the kinetics of viral multiplication are decreased (Amaya et al., 2014). To test whether Ag-126 treatment reduced CPE in TC-83 infected U87MG cells, we imaged infected, untreated cells and infected, Ag-126-treated cells 24 hpi (\nFig. 8A). The infected, Ag-126-treated cells (panels D, H and L) appeared to be healthier than the infected, untreated cells (panels C, G and K) and phenotypically resembled the mock infected, untreated cells (A, E and I). Ag-126 treatment by itself did not change the morphology of the cells (B, F and J) when compared to the mock infected, untreated cells. Next we adopted a quantitative cell survival assay to verify increased cell viability when treated with Ag-126. In the survival assay, we measured the fraction of live cells by Cell-Titer-Glo at 24 and 48 hpi in the presence and absence of Ag-126 (Fig. 8B and C). At 24 hpi, infected cells treated with DMSO alone dropped to 75% of the luminescence seen in the uninfected cells. However, Ag-126-treated cells showed 11% more luminescence when compared to DMSO alone. At 48 hpi, treated cells had 32% more survival than the DMSO alone control. Collectively, the data supports the idea that in conjunction with exerting antiviral activity, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation during early stages of infection by inhibitors, such as Ag-126, can contribute to increasing survival of infected cells.",

In this experiment, we utilized the Trinidad Donkey (TrD) strain of VEEV, the GA97 strain of EEEV, and the California 1930 strain of WEEV. To this end, U87MG cells were pretreated with DMSO or Ag-126 and then infected with each of the virulent strains. All infections were performed for 1-hour and conditioned media were replaced and the supernatants collected 24 h later. Plaque assays were performed to quantify infectious viral particles (\nFig. 9). Addition of Ag-126 treatment reduced viral titers of VEEV TrD from 8.67\u00d7108\n PFU/ml to 8.17\u00d7104\n PFU/ml, a 4-log decrease. In the case of EEEV, treatment resulted in an overall 1-log drop, from 1.48\u00d71010\n PFU/ml to 9.17\u00d7108\n PFU/ml. For WEEV, Ag-126 treatment contributed to a 2-log decrease in viral titer from 2.83\u00d7105\n PFU/ml to 5.33\u00d7103\n PFU/ml.

To this end, we employed various MEK1/2 inhibitors to characterize their effect on TC-83 multiplication in our cells. We chose to evaluate PD184352, GSK1120212, AZD6244, and U0126. Among these, GSK1120212 is already FDA approved for cancer therapy, and would therefore be a strong candidate to repurpose as an antiviral therapeutic for alphaviruses. The toxicity profile of each compound was evaluated at 50 and 20 \u03bcM concentrations in U87MG cells by Cell-Titer-Glo assay as described previously. PD184352 showed a significant decrease in cell viability to 74% at 50 \u03bcM treatment, but was relatively nontoxic at 20 \u03bcM (\nFig. 10A). All other compounds were non-toxic at both concentrations. U87MG cells were then pre treated with 50 \u03bcM of each MEK inhibitor, except for PD184352 which was tested at 20 \u03bcM, and then infected with TC-83 virus. Supernatants were collected 24 h later and subjected to plaque assay. The results showed that GSK1120212 was able to decrease VEEV multiplication by up to 2 logs while AD184352 was also effective, but to a lesser extent. U0126 and AZD6244 were not effective at inhibiting TC-83 multiplication in this system (Fig. 10B). Cumulatively, our data indicated that inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is an attractive option to inhibit alphavirus multiplication in human cells.",

            "text": "Innate immune responses that are established early following exposure to infectious agents play an essential role in pathogen control and protection of the host. Such innate immune mechanisms are shaped by host phospho-signaling responses that undergo fairly elaborate modulation upon cellular insult, which includes exposure to infectious agents. Virus infection is well documented to activate many host signaling responses that often shift the balance between host survival and cell death. Many viruses have been known to hijack some of these intrinsic host responses to enable establishment of a productive viral infection. Often such hijacking mechanisms involve additional host responses that are also modified, cumulatively resulting in a suppressed host environment where the virus can multiply without interference by the innate host protective mechanisms such as interferon responses. In fact, New World alphaviruses including VEEV and WEEV have been known to suppress the host interferon response by a mechanism that involves the viral capsid protein (Atasheva et al., 2010, Peltier et al., 2013). As part of the pathogenesis, New World alphaviruses have also been known to trigger apoptosis of the infected cells, mediated by host signaling pathways (Griffin and Hardwick, 1997). Our previous studies using GSK-3\u03b2 and IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors have established that inhibition of host phospho-signaling events exerts an inhibitory effect on viral multiplication in infected human cells (Amaya et al., 2014, Kehn-Hall et al., 2012, Narayanan et al., 2012).",

Our observation that phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased in TC-83 infected cells while there were no significant changes observed in the levels of total ERK1/2 protein indicated that the increase in phosphorylated forms was independent of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). Small molecule inhibitors of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, such as Ag-126, when used in the nontoxic range, have the potential to inhibit viral multiplication (Fig. 2). We have observed that the inhibition is mediated through interruption of potentially early and late events in the infectious process. Our data suggests that the compound is not directly virucidal. We hypothesize that Ag-126 is likely to interfere with a host process that is essential for the internalized virus to go through the subsequent steps of capsid shedding and release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of the cell. Additional steps in the inhibitory process may involve abberations in packaging and viral egress. Ongoing research to address these possibilities will include analysis of host events that are essential for the intracellular transport of the virus, which may involve cytoskeletal dynamics.",

For example, viral nonstructural proteins (nsPs) may be phosphorylated by host kinases that influence their function. One such alphavirus protein that is known to be heavily phosphorylated is nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) (Li et al., 1990, Per\u00e4nen et al., 1988, Vihinen and Saarinen, 2000). nsP3 is a critical regulator of negative strand synthesis and affects virulence. However, the exact role of nsP3 in the viral infectious cycle continues to remain unknown. Our earlier studies have indicated that nsP3 may be phosphorylated by IKK-\u03b2. We will be characterizing the phosphorylation status of nsP3 in the presence of inhibitors, such as Ag-126, because nsP3 contains other potential phosphorylation sites. These interesting aspects are currently under investigation in our laboratory. In addition, it appears that localization of E2 glycoprotein to the ER of infected cells may be affected by Ag-126 (Fig. 6). It is therefore interesting to speculate that Ag-126 may have an effect on viral particle assembly and packaging.",

We have focused the current study only on ERK and its phosphorylation status. This study opens new avenues of exploration on the consequences of the phosphorylation of additional targets in this cascade on alphavirus replication. For example, p90RSK phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be intimately associated with replication of SARS-coronavirus (Mizutani et al., 2006). It would be interesting to determine whether inhibitors of these multiple ERK phospho-signaling nodes will exert a synergistic and more potent inhibition of the virus when used in a combinatorial capacity.",

To conduct the RPPA study, approximately 30\u201350 nl of each sample were printed onto nitrocellulose slides (Whatman, MA) using a high-resolution 2470 arrayer (Aushon Biosystems, Billerica, MA). Randomly chosed slides were stained with CyproRuby stain to quantify total protein which will be used in signal normalization (described below).

(A) Cells were fixed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hpi and stained with antibodies against VEEV glycoprotein (red) and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (green). The slides were also stained with DAPI to stain the nucleus (blue). Slides were also fixed and stained with a golgi marker (green) at the same time points. Images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U and acquired at 60\u00d7 objective. Images are representative of multiple fields that were imaged for each variable. Two independent experiments were conducted. (B) Cells from triplicate wells in two experiments were counted at random for co-localization of VEEV glycoprotein and the ER in the presence and absence of Ag-126.",
