During 1906\u20131908, in the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil, \u223c4000 cattle and 1000 horses and mules died of paralytic rabies. During daylight hours, bats were observed approaching animals and trying to bite them. Carini [5] suspected that these bats were involved in the transmission of the rabies virus. Haupt and Rehaag, 2 German veterinarians who were called to investigate the outbreaks, could prove the presence of Negri bodies in the brain of captured bats, and this resulted in the first proven causal link between bats and viral disease [1]. It was not until the rabies virus was isolated from an insectivorous bat in the United States in 1953 that investigators began to focus their attention on this flying mammal as a possible reservoir host for this virus in nature. At this time, investigators also began to consider that bats may be reservoir hosts for other viruses.",

A new paramyxovirus, Hendra virus, was responsible for the deaths of 2 humans and 15 horses during 2 separate outbreaks [7]. After extensive epidemiological investigations, it was determined that fruit bats, namely those belonging to the genus Pteropus, were the most likely reservoir hosts. Shortly thereafter, this new virus was isolated from a number of pteropid bats [8]. During these investigations, a new rhabdovirus, Australian bat lyssavirus, was isolated from a pteropid bat [9]. When another 2 RNA viruses were discovered as part of disease outbreak investigations, authorities immediately looked to bats as possible reservoir hosts. Menangle virus was responsible for a large number of fetal deaths at a commercial piggery, and antibodies capable of neutralizing Menangle virus have been found in pteropid bats [10]. Nipah virus swept through numerous piggeries in Malaysia and killed >100 people during the period from 1998 through 1999. Local pteropid bats were identified as having antibodies capable of neutralizing Nipah virus, and eventually the virus was isolated from bat excreta in Malaysia [11]. In Bangladesh, >70 people have been killed in annual Nipah virus outbreaks since 2001, and once again, local pteropid bats have been identified as having antibodies capable of neutralizing Nipah virus [12\u201314]. The natural history and pathogenesis of Hendra virus and Nipah virus is reviewed by Daszak et al. [15] and Field et al. [16]. During investigations of Nipah virus in Malaysia, 2 previously unrecognized viruses, Tioman virus and Pulau virus, were isolated from bat excreta [17, 18] (figure 1). More recently, although civets were originally implicated in the SARS outbreak in China, the true wildlife reservoir was found to be bats, which are also sold in wet markets [3]. During <10 years, 7 new RNA viruses were isolated from bats in Southeast Asia and Australia. Different species of bats with different geographic ranges were implicated.",

This is clearly demonstrated with the recently emerged paramyxoviruses. To date, Hendra virus, isolated from the Australian species of pteropid bats, has been responsible for disease only in spillover hosts (horses) on the east coast of Australia. All human infections have occurred as a result of exposure to infected horses\u2014thus, the limited geographic distribution of human disease. The Malaysian strain of Nipah virus, isolated from Malaysian species of pteropid bats, has caused disease only in spillover hosts (the major one being pigs) in that country, and, similarly, human infections occurred as a result of exposure to infected pigs. The Bangladesh strain of Nipah virus has caused disease only in spillover hosts (humans) in that region. In all of these examples, if the reservoir host was not afforded the opportunity of coming in contact with the spillover host, human disease would not have ensued.",

            "text": "Typically, anthropogenic factors lead to alterations of contact rates between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife hosts [19]. The major cause of infectious disease emergence can be linked to human activities [19]. Examples include agricultural expansion into pristine forests, as occurred in Malaysia where Nipah virus emerged; wildlife trade, in which many species of animals are brought together at high density with humans, which led to the emergence of SARS in China; or global travel, during which people can expand the range of a virus by carrying it on planes, which led to the global spread of SARS. If one were to try to predict spillover events, it would be prudent to focus on the geographic range of the reservoir host. Changes in this range may create new opportunities for the virus, particularly if this change results in the reservoir host coming in contact with a suitable spillover host. Bat phylogeny and viral phylogeny may also suggest where we may see new viruses emerge.",

            "text": "If one examines the viruses isolated from bats and the bat species from which they were isolated, one would detect that some closely related bats harbor closely related viruses. For example, an orthoreovirus (Nelson Bay virus) was recovered from a grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) in eastern Australia [20]. Although no diseases have been associated with this virus, interest has been rekindled by the isolation of 2 related orthoreoviruses from flying foxes in different geographic locations. Pulau virus was isolated in Malaysia from Pteropus hypomelanus, and Broome virus was isolated from Pteropus alecto in northern Australia [18] (Cummins, Lunt, and Wang, personal communication). Although the bat orthoreoviruses are currently not considered to have any zoonotic potential, they are examples of viruses evolving in geographically separated bat populations (figure 2). The phylogeny of these bats and their associated viruses supports the theory of viral coevolution with their chiropteran hosts. This theory is further supported by the isolation of new paramyxoviruses and lyssaviruses isolated from bats in Australia and Southeast Asia (figure 3) and the large number of coronaviruses found in various bats at different locations in China [21, 22]. These patterns of similar\u2014yet distinct\u2014viruses in similar\u2014yet distinct\u2014species of bats preempts the discovery of \u201cnew\u201d chiropteran viruses.",

Although recent work has made progress of understanding bat-virus interactions at the molecular and individual host level, we are still in our infancy when it comes to understanding how these interactions play out at the population and ecosystem levels. Consider the 4 viruses that emerged from pteropid bats within 5 years: Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus. The fact that 4 viruses emerged from 1 host genus within a short period of time strongly suggests that host factors play a role in emergence. However, unraveling the ecological changes that caused emergence requires a detailed understanding of how host biology interacts with the rapidly changing ecosystems on which these bats depend. For bat diseases, this is generally an immense challenge. Bats have historically been underappreciated by both the general public and the scientific community, and therefore, basic data on bat disease ecology and immunology are lacking. Furthermore, bats have incredibly complex population structures and are highly mobile, nocturnal, and often difficult to catch. They also exhibit some unique life-history traits that may influence their interactions with viruses in ways that we do not yet understand. For example, bats are the only mammals that fly, they have very short digestive tracts, they have unusual dietary preferences, and many species hibernate.",

Hendra virus researchers used a modeling framework to show that habitat fragmentation may change the dynamics of Hendra virus infection within Pteropus species, leading to increased risk of emergence among horses and humans [24]. In other cases, observational and epidemiological studies have been able to identify putative causes of emergence. For example, there is evidence that planting fruit trees around piggeries caused increased bat and pig contact in Malaysia, leading to the spillover of Nipah virus to pigs [15]. With this knowledge, appropriate controls can be implemented to prevent future spillover events. In Queensland, Australia, advice to horse owners includes placing horses in paddocks that do not contain trees attractive to bats for either feeding or roosting. In addition, horse feed bins or watering points should not be placed under trees when there is a risk of bats using that tree for feeding, resting, or roosting.",

Why have the bats come out of the forest? Deforestation, which results in habitat destruction, roost disturbance, and habitat fragmentation, is undoubtedly the main force driving bats into urban and periurban areas [35]. Ecosystem and land-use changes have played a significant role in the emergence of new, and reemergence of old, infectious diseases in humans (e.g., malaria, yellow fever, hemorrhagic fevers, dengue fever, cholera, and West Nile virus) [36]. Forests have effectively disappeared in 25 countries, and >90% of the former forest cover has been lost in a further 29 countries [36]. Increasing consumption per person, multiplied by a growing human population, is stated as the root cause of the increasing demand for ecosystem services that has led to these losses [36]. Continued degradation and fragmentation of the natural habitats of microbats and megabats has forced increased overlap of bat, domestic animal, and human ecologies, which has created increased opportunities for bat-borne zoonotic diseases to emerge.",
