Inflammatory conditions such as pneumonia can affect the phrenic nerve passing through the thoracic cavity. Central or peripheral neuropathies such as viral, metabolic, toxic, or immune\u2010mediated diseases can lead to degeneration of the spinal cord, nerve roots, or phrenic nerve. Finally, myopathies can directly affect the diaphragm muscle or accessory respiratory muscles leading to respiratory weakness.",

Two alpacas had findings associated with a diaphragmatic myopathic condition and multiple peripheral nerves showing signs of degeneration. The myopathies were variable with 1 alpaca showing signs of a neurogenic atrophy and the changes in the muscle of the 2nd alpaca were either too early to shows signs of neurogenic atrophy or attributable to another unknown process. Two alpacas had spinal cord lesions as well as phrenic nerve degeneration and 2 alpacas had degenerative lesions of only the phrenic nerve or multiple nerves. Reports in humans, dogs, and horses describe similar degenerative lesions as Wallerian degeneration or \u201cdying back\u201d neuropathies.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n In horses, a dying back neuropathy is most often associated with the recurrent laryngeal nerve leading to laryngeal hemiplegia.\n9\n Similar recurrent laryngeal nerve lesions were not reported in these alpacas and clinical signs did not indicate laryngeal involvement. Currently, there are multiple proposed etiologies regarding these types of neuropathies in humans and animals and include inadequate transport of cellular products to the distal axons, inflammatory, nutritional, metabolic, toxic, and heritable conditions.\n7\n, \n9\n Ancillary testing and history essentially ruled out many disease processes as the etiology in these alpacas. There are no reported genetic or heritable conditions responsible for peripheral neuropathies in camelids. Three of the alpacas shared a grandsire but otherwise no hereditary link could be made.",

This could have been attributable to poor animal management or secondary because of insufficient intake with the respiratory difficulty and increased metabolic activity by the accessory respiratory muscles. Three alpacas in Colorado were found to have low vitamin E levels, otherwise vitamin and mineral deficiencies or excesses (vitamin E, thiamine, and selenium) were not observed. Neuropathies caused by vitamin E deficiencies have been reported in humans, horses, dogs, and chickens.\n9\n Lesions vary by species and include cerebellar, spinal cord, myopathies, and retinopathies so diaphragmatic paralysis can be a manifestation for hypovitaminosis E in alpacas. Vitamin E deficiency appears to be a common regional problem because of year\u2010round feeding of hay with insufficient supplementation; however, many alpacas are found to have vitamin E deficiencies without other clinical signs.\n10\n, \n11\n Additional vitamin supplementation did not alter outcome in most of the alpacas. The effect of vitamin E is unknown but might be because of the antioxidant benefits and the supportive role in neuron function.\n12\n\n",

Minimal respiratory stress occurs during the fluoroscopic procedures because the alpacas are maintained in sternal recumbency and oxygen can be provided as needed during the procedure. Thoracic radiographs can be difficult to interpret as it is difficult to obtain consistent inhalation or exhalation images and inhumane to restrict breathing in order to adequately access diaphragm position. Hemiparalysis often causes a characteristic increases in the affected side that is easily observed on thoracic films.\n4\n, \n13\n Ultrasound can be used but requires a skilled operator who is familiar with thoracic anatomy. Other diagnostic testing that can aid in diagnosing diaphragmatic paralysis in animals includes arterial blood gas measurements, respiratory inductive plethysmography and pneumotachography, nerve conduction studies, and electromyogram testing.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n6\n Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new tool for use in animals and might be helpful in evaluating nerve conduction abnormalities and localizing spinal cord lesions.\n14\n\n",
