Our tertiary care hospital in Parma, Italy, has largely been repurposed to care for patients with COVID-19, reaching more than 800 hospital beds dedicated to patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic. Within 1 week, we provided care for four patients with COVID-19 with acute limb ischaemia.",

            "text": "Two of these patients had comorbidities (a previous subclavian artery stenting, and a concomitant atrial fibrillation). However, the other two patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were young and active patients with no comorbidity. At presentation, both patients without comorbidities were receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis, and D-dimer concentrations were higher than 9000 ng/mL. One patient, a man aged 53 years who received invasive mechanical ventilation, presented with bilateral lower limb ischaemia secondary to acute aortoiliac thrombosis. He underwent emergent thromboembolectomy through femoral cutdowns, with bilateral pedal pulse recovery. Inspected arteries were free from macroscopic atherosclerotic disease. However, thrombosis reoccurred approximately 2 h after the thromboembolectomy, and the patient died on postoperative day 2. The other patient, a man aged 37 years, received oxygen support through a nasal cannula and presented with an acute ischaemia of the upper left limb. The clot was visible by duplex ultrasound at the level of the humeral artery bifurcation. After 2 days of unfractionated heparin administration, the acute limb ischaemia resolved.",
