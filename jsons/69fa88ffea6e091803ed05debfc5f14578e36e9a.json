A technique for the preparation of such cell cultures, using a combination of manual and trypsin disaggregation of kidneys dissected from 2-to 3-week-old birds is described. This technique routinely gives high cell yield together with high viability and the resultant adherent primary cultures can be used for virus growth and plaque formation.",

Maassab in 1959 [ 3 ] describes the preparation of Chicken Kidney monolayer cultures from 4-to 5-day-old chicks, the cultures being used for studies with some human viruses and Churchill [ 4 ] reports the use of chicken kidney tissue cultures derived from 3 to 8 week old chickens in the study of avian viruses including Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV). The technique for the production of kidney cell monolayer cultures from young birds, as described here, is adapted from those published by Dulbecco and Vogt [ 1 ] , and Youngner [ 2 ] for monkey kidney cells.",

Following adaptation in embryonated eggs, the Beaudette strain of IBV produced characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE) on fi rst passage in CK cells, whilst the Massachusetts strain produced CPE in the second CK passage [ 4 ] . CPE consists of syncytia formation which occurs at 6 h post inoculation with the Beaudette strain [ 7 ] . The syncytia may contain as many as 20-40 or more nuclei and they quickly round up and detach from the culture surface. Growth curves of IBV in CK cells show a lag phase of 2-4 h and maximum virus yield in 18-20 h [ 5 ] .",
