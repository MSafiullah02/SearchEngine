Recorded laboratory and microbiology findings, antibiotic treatment and outcome status upon discharge were also collected. Independent expert pulmonologists unaware of the microbiologic diagnosis retrospectively interpreted each CXR. They subsequently assigned the final diagnosis of the various types of ALRI in this study based on a combination of the CXR interpretation and information from the CRF. Written informed consent was obtained from patients aged 18 years and older and the parents or guardians of children.

Blood Hemoline Diphasic Performance culture bottles (BioM\u00e9rieux) were stored in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. The incubator was provided by the surveillance project and was transported daily along with sputum which had been collected in the preceding 12 hours. Swabs were immediately placed in a viral transport medium after collection, which was containers consisting of frozen liquid nitrogen. As part of the National Tuberculosis Control Program, direct sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing was performed on admission and repeated during the subsequent two days in the hospital laboratories. White cell counts and blood chemistries were also performed in the hospital laboratories. The provider-initiated testing and counseling policy was initiated in 2007 in Cambodia.

Three external expert pulmonologists concurred that a severe case would be defined by the presence of at least 2 of the following criteria: systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, heart rate \u2265120 beats per minute, respiratory rate \u226530/min, oxygen saturation <90% measured by pulse oximeter, body temperature <35\u00b0C or \u226540\u00b0C; international severity indices (e.g. PSI or CURB65) for pneumonia could not be applied in absence of ICUs or blood urea testing. Pneumonia was defined by the radiologic images of lobar consolidation, nodules, alveolar or interstitial infiltrates; a necrotizing pneumonia meant presence of cavitations. Preexisting pulmonary lesions may alter or disguise the appearance of a pneumonic infiltrate. Consequently we created a separate diagnostic group, ALRI with lung sequelae which was defined as radiological images of cavitary sequelae, partial collapse or bronchiectasis. The ALRI with the normal parenchyma group consisted of patients presenting with symptoms of acute bronchitis and normal lung radiographs.",

Sputum was only available for culture in 888 (46.6%) patients ranging from 21.9% among cases presenting with pleural effusions alone to 64.0% among pneumonia cases. In contrast, sputum specimens were more readily available for direct AFB examination. This major gap was mainly explained by incorrect sputum specimen collection that resulted in salivary contamination (monthly mean rate 13.2%, range: 5.3% - 23.9%). Overall, a combination of these tests identified bacterial and viral etiology in 749 (42.9%) patients ranging from 8.8% positive results in patients with pleural effusions alone to 69.8% in patients with necrotizing pneumonia (Table 1). Mixed infections were not associated with severity (p = 0.192) or a specific type of ALRI, except between the groups of necrotizing pneumonia and non-cavitary pneumonia (7.3% versus 1.6%, p < 0.001) (Table 1). Of the identified pathogens, bacteria (73.9%) were the most frequent etiology in pneumonia with predominantly AFB (41.2%; 67.7% in necrotizing pneumonia and 21.5% in non-cavitary pneumonia), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (9.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.5%) (Figure 2). Bacteria also predominated in lung sequelae-associated ALRI (67.9%) consisting of H. influenzae (21.1%), AFB (19.3%), Gram-negative bacteria (11.0%) and S. pneumoniae (10.6%). In contrast, a viral etiology was predominant in ALRI patients with a normal CXR (67.5%) including the pleural effusions group (54.5%) and ALRI with normal CXR group (74.3%) (Figure 1).",

However, in this study, we were surprised to have found AFB to be the most common pathogen in hospitalized patients with acute pneumonia. Although Cambodia is known as one of the countries with the highest TB prevalence and incidence reported in the world (http://www.who.int/tb/country/en/index.html), the interpretation of these results is unclear. It is possible that the history of illness was poorly recalled by the patient or a mixed infection existed with a non-TB respiratory pathogen which may have led to hospitalization. On the other hand, there is emerging evidence across the world and particularly shown in African studies, that M. tuberculosis is commonly present in acute community-acquired pneumonia in children [15,19] and adults [20], particularly in settings of high TB prevalence. One suggested explanation is the increased susceptibility to bacterial infection (particularly pneumococcal infection) by prior M. tuberculosis infection as demonstrated by experimental studies [21]. In the present study, 21% of tuberculosis cases were co-infected with other bacteria, of which S. pneumoniae was the main (43%) pathogen identified. Our findings imply that expanding the TB screening criteria to include acute pneumonia might be considered. Of note, Cambodia is planning to develop a multi-symptoms approach to increase cost-effective routine screening for TB.",

Prior to this study, these bacteria tended not to be recognized by local clinicians who empirically treated patients with a penicillin A-based therapy, an antibiotic that is not effective on some naturally resistant strains of Gram-negative bacteria such as B. pseudomallei[22,23]. In adult patients with non-cavitary pneumonia, common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia in West and Far-East Asia include S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae[15,16,24-26]. First, atypical pathogens (i.e. C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae) were rarely detected in our hospitalized patients: of a subgroup of sputum specimens from a group of 304 randomly selected study patients, only 3 tested positive by PCR: 2 for M. pneumoniae and 1 for C. pneumoniae (IPC, unpublished data). This result was also observed elsewhere [20,27,28] and was consistent with another recent study of community-acquired pneumonia among immuno-compromised adults in Cambodia [27]. Secondly, we found a lower frequency of S. pneumoniae compared with other bacteria. Because S. pneumoniae is known to be fragile, some related infections might have gone undetected as cultures were performed at IPC after a certain delay due to transportation of specimens [29]. The extent of undetected S. pneumoniae infection may be suggested by the following sub-study: of a random sample of 24 ALRI cases (median 58 years of age, range 18 \u2013 78) for which we also collected urine samples, three (13%, 95% confidence interval 3% - 32%) patients tested positive for S. pneumoniae antigen by Binax NOW\u00ae rapid immunochromatographic assay (Scarborough, ME). (IPC, unpublished data). Accounting for this underestimation, one might expect S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae \u2013related respiratory infections to reach ~60% of the bacterial etiology of acute pneumonia. As a Global Alliance Vaccine Initiative or GAVI - eligible country, Cambodia introduced H. influenzae b vaccines in 2010 and will probably do so in the near future for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.",

Moreover, age was determined as a major confounding factor when identifying risks associated with viral etiologies.

Interestingly, wheezing was also independently associated with viral respiratory infection. This relationship between viral infection, asthma (wheezing as its surrogate), and disease severity have been observed more recently. Indeed, recent studies suggest that respiratory infections caused by rhinoviruses or RSV in infancy can lead to the development of asthma at an older age [40,41], which could be exacerbated by viral infections [34,42,43]. Recognizing the high frequency of wheezing in children with pneumonia (~62%) and its association with hyperleucocytosis in our study, it is possible that asthma could either directly cause a severe case or lead indirectly to signs of severity via superinfection and subsequent pneumonia. Education programs designed to recognize asthmatic symptoms, teach management strategies, and encourage the prevention of asthma should be urgently implemented.",

            "text": "These preceding findings need to be interpreted in light of some major limitations. First, the rate of bacteria identification in this study was low compared to other studies using routine clinical diagnostic techniques [15,27,44]. Approximately 17% of bacterial diagnoses were achieved through the use of blood or sputum cultures. This relatively low yield contrasted with a much higher proportion of pneumonia-related patients (~40%) who had an elevated blood neutrophil count, a parameter that is indicative of bacterial infection. Various factors contributed to this low yield, including the probable high intake of antibiotics, which can be bought without a prescription and frequently are administered irrespective of the proper dosage and length in Cambodia [45]. Since there was only a one-time collection of sputum and blood for each patient, a high bacterial yield was not expected. Moreover, sputum tests, which are commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, may lack specificity without evocative clinical information, have poor sensitivity or are frequently contaminated by saliva or upper respiratory tract colonization. This resulted in having to discard numerous sputum specimens prior to culture in our study. The use of invasive procedures such as brochioalveolar lavage or sputum induction was difficult to introduce, particularly in children. Second, the burden of TB in this study was probably largely underestimated as cultures for M. tuberculosis were not performed [46].",
