            "text": "Gastroenteritis due to rotavirus and coronavirus infections has a significant economical impact on agriculture. Yet, despite numerous trials and decades of research on these two viruses, effective vaccines are still not available. Although research efforts have appeared promising, vaccine field trials continue to produce inadequate results or fail entirely (de Leeuw et al., 1980; Myers and Snodgrass, 1982; Snodgrass et al., 1982; Waltner-Toews et al., 1985). Following infection the only treatment available is supportive therapy such as fluid replacement. Thus, viral gastroenteritis is still largely uncontrolled and alternative methods to control infection appear necessary. One of the goals of our laboratory has been to investigate a broad spectrum antiviral agents that is not discriminatory among various serotypes and strains of viruses. Provided that these agents could be used as food additives, they would have a distinct advantage over vaccines in prevention of infection and/or disease due to their broad spectrum of activity and because most agents that cause gastroenteritis are contracted orally, usually via contaminated food and water.",

All solvents and reagent materials used were of the highest purity commercially available. Theaflavin, theaflavin monogallates, and theaflavin digallate were extracted from tea following a modified version of the method described by Roberts and Myers (1959). Tea (100 g) was added to 2.5l of water, boiled for 5 min and filtered. The filtrate was cooled below 30\u00b0C and then 20 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added. A precipitate formed and the mixture was left in a cool, dark place overnight. The tea was then centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min to separate the precipitate from the aqueous portion. The wet precipitate was resuspended in approximately 200 ml water and extracted four times with 150 ml ethyl acetate (EA), and centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min. EA extracts were combined and washed with 150 ml of 2.5% NaHCO3 and then with 0.1 M sulfuric acid. The extracts were centrifuged each time at 500\u00d7g to remove the aqueous layer. The EA extracts were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The dry extract was reconstituted in 10 ml acetone and then precipitated with 80 ml chloroform. The precipitate was collected and centrifuged at 6500\u00d7g for 5 min. Light petroleum ether was added and the suspensions were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min. The precipitate was dried at 37\u00b0C and the yield was calculated. Further purification was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).",

It was found in the conformational search of TF1 that the hydroxylated bynzopyranyl (HBP) functional groups were commonly found parallel to one another and perpendicular to the benzocyloheptenone (BCH) ring structure. An additional gallic acid group attached through an ester bond on one of the HBP functional groups formed the TF2A and TF2B compounds (Fig. 3\n). In reviewing the results of the conformational search for TF2A, it was noted that the two HBP groups would form a conformer with their orientation parallel to one another and the gallic ester group would lie parallel to the BCH group (Fig. 3). This was similar to the three-dimensional structure of TF1, except for the placement of the gallic ester group. However, when the conformers of TF2B were reviewed the parallel conformation of the HBP functional groups was found but the placement of gallic ester was not along the BCH ring structure. The lowest energy conformer of the TF3 had both gallic esters parallel over the BCH ring system. The orientation of the gallic esters is interdependent on the orientation of the HBP functional groups which were also found parallel to one another and perpendicular to the main ring system (Fig. 3).",

Our results indicate that there is synergism between the component fractions TF1, TF2A, TF2B, and TF3 which have an activity level that is greater when combined and when any one fraction is tested individually.

As expected, we found that the source of tea varies widely in yield of overall crude extract and thus quantity of individual fractions which should be considered when purchasing tea. According to our data, the activity of the crude extract and the theaflavin and theaflavin gallate derivatives is constant in individual samples but there is a large variation among samples as a result of the source of tea used. The results of this study support that theaflavin and theaflavin gallate derivatives have inactivation activity (in vitro) against both rotavirus and coronavirus. Neutralization activity varies among the crude extract, the uncharacterized initial peaks and each of the individual fractions. An explanation of the differences in effectiveness of the theaflavin compounds could be due to conformational differences. The simplest structure was TF1 which also had the greatest effect on infectivity of the individual fractions (Table 2). The theaflavin monogallate compounds are very similar in their structure (the same functional groups, same molecular weights) but have significant differences in their effect on infectivity. It is suggested since the compounds differ only by the placement of the gallic ester group that a conformation could be responsible for the difference in the effects on infectivity. Steric interactions may restrict access to the BCH group in TF2A and thus reduce its effect on neutralizing infectivity. The conformations of TF1, TF2B, and TF3 had conformers that left the functional groups of the BCH ring structure sterically accessible while the gallic ester on TF2A would wrap around the BCH structure which could reduce accessibility to this functional group. Since the initial peaks appear to have such great activity, future work should include defining their chemical composition.",

Is drinking a cup of tea in fact therapeutic for rotavirus infection? We of course cannot extrapolate from our in vitro studies to answer that. However, according to our extractions, one 8 ounce cup (240 ml) of brewed tea (U.S. source, 2.5 gm of tea leaves) contains approximately 0.375 mg of crude theaflavin extract, which is equal to 15.6 \u03bcg/ml. There is 0.35 \u03bcg/ml of crude theaflavin required for one EC50 in vitro and thus approximately 45 times that amount in each cup of tea.
