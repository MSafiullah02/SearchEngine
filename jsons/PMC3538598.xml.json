            "text": "Infectious diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, being responsible for 2.16 million deaths a year, including 1.5 million pediatric deaths (3.7% of deaths in the world) (\nhttp://who.int/en/). Infectious diarrhea is caused by a wide spectrum of enteropathogens including the bacteria Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp. and Clostridium difficile[1] and noroviruses, rotaviruses, toroviruses, coronaviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses and adenoviruses, all pathogens reportedly causing 50% of cases of diarrhea\n[2]. As most of these pathogens are fastidious to culture, the direct diagnosis of infectious diarrhea relies on the detection of enteropathogen-specific antigen by immunochromatographic assays\n[3-6] and the detection of enteropathogen-specific nucleic sequences by PCR, real-time PCR and DNA microarray\n[7,8]. Later detection however is hampered by the presence of PCR inhibitors\n[9] and the dilution of targeted pathogen in watery stools. When the normal excretion of water in stool varies between 150 and 200 mL every 24 hours\n[10], water excretion may increase up to one liter in diarrheic stools\n[11]. Previous studies showed that a preliminary enrichment step applied to stool increases the detection of enteropathogen DNA\n[12,13]. However, such an enrichment step delays molecular testing for up to 48 hours. We therefore aimed to optimize the DNA extraction protocol to target both bacteria and archaea in diarrheal stool specimens.",

These 15 diluted specimens were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was frozen for 4 hours at \u221220\u00b0C and freeze-dried lyophilized for 24 hours in 1-mL glass containers (Dominique Dustcher, Brumath, France) using a LYOVAC GTZ instrument (Leybold Hereaeus, Roubaix, France). After lyophilization, stool specimens were regenerated into 250 \u03bcL PBS resulting in a four-fold concentration of the stool specimens. The second aliquot was not lyophilized. The DNA extraction was then performed for the two aliquots using a semi-automated protocol combining the EZ1 Advanced XL extractor (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and a phenol-chloroform DNA extraction\n[14]. For the extraction protocol, a 250 \u03bcL-aliquot of the resuspension of lyophilized sample was transferred into a sterile screw-cap Eppendorf tube containing 0.3 g of acid-washed beads (\u2264106 mm; Sigma, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) and shaken in a FastPrep BIO 101 apparatus (Qbiogene, Strasbourg, France) at level 6.5 (full speed) for 180 s to achieve mechanical lysis. The supernatant was collected and incubated overnight at 56\u00b0C with 180 mL of lysis buffer and 25 \u03bcL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) from the Qiagen EZ1\u00ae DNA Tissue kit. A 100 \u03bcL-volume of total DNA was then extracted from 200 \u03bcL specimens using the Qiagen EZ1\u00ae DNA Tissue kit in the EZ1 Advanced XL extractor. A final step of phenol-chloroform extraction was performed. Negative controls consisting of sterile DNA-free water were introduced at all steps and underwent the same extraction process that was used for the stool specimens. We analyzed specimens by real-time PCR with systems targeting a 128-bp portion of the 16S rRNA gene of M. smithii (V4 region, positions 648\u2013739, M. smithii Genbank accession number IQ 346750), Bacteria 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 inter spacer region, positions 555\u2013639, Escherichia coli Genbank accession number FN 821375) and a specific system targeting a 121-bp part of the chorismate synthase gene of Salmonella enterica (Table \n1). These real-time PCR systems were designed in our laboratory using the Primer3 software (\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). The specificity of primers and probes (using a pre-test 100% coverage and 100% identity for the targeted pathogens criteria) was tested using megaBlast against the nr-NCBI database (\nhttp://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). In-silico analyses indicated that the \u201cuniversal\u201d bacterial system recognized more than 18,000 bacterial species, but also 300 archeal species and less than 10 eukaryota. Among the 18,000 bacterial species the \u201cuniversal\u201d system missed Chlamydiae and TM7 divisions, but allowed the detection of some Spirochetes and Synergistes. Whereas the M. smithii system forward primer system matches with other Methanobrevibacter species including M. oralis, M. arboriphilus, M. ruminantum or M. wolinii, reverser primer and the probe were found to be specific for M. smithii. The system targeting S. enterica was designed based on the complete genome of S. enterica subspecies enterica Typhimurium strain 798 (GenBank accession number CP003386). Primers and probe of this system were found to be specific for S. enterica, allowing the amplification of S. enterica serovars Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Typhimurium, Gallinarum, Paratyphi A and B, Saintpaul, Schwarzengrund, Dublin and Newport. Primers and probes were diluted to 20 pmol/\u03bcL and 25 pmol/\u03bcL respectively. PCR mixtures (20 \u03bcL) contained 10 \u03bcL Master Mix (Qiagen), 0.5 \u03bcL each primer and probe, 0.5 \u03bcL uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Saint Aubin, France), four \u03bcL water and four \u03bcL DNA. Real-time PCRs incorporated two-min UDG decontamination at 50\u00b0C and ten-min denaturation at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles (45 cycles for M. smithii detection) of one second at 95\u00b0C, 35 seconds at 60\u00b0C and 45 seconds at 72\u00b0C. Each specific real-time PCR incorporated a positive and a negative control. The cut-off of positivity was set-up at a 38 cycle threshold (Ct). All specimens were tested in duplicate.",
