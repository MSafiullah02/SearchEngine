Respiratory symptoms included cough, sputum, dyspnoea, chest pain, blood tinged sputum, and cyanosis. For each PC episode, the time to diagnosis from transplantation, diagnostic procedures applied, time to BAL or LB since PI appearance, and relevant medical conditions were investigated. In addition, changes in the empirical treatment attributable to the results from diagnostic tests were recorded. The evaluation of medical conditions at the time of PI initiation considered the following: the presence of engraftment syndrome, acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, VOD, or CMV infection; medication being administrated; and organ dysfunction, identified using the specific Pediatric Critical Care Medicine criteria published in 2003.20 Criteria for organ dysfunction of the cardiovascular, neurological, haematological, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic systems were evaluated, and the data indicating the most severe condition within 48 hours of PI appearance were used. Respiratory dysfunction was excluded from the criteria as arterial blood gas was not frequently measured in children with mild respiratory distress. Acute and chronic GVHDs were assessed as described elsewhere.21, 22 CMV infection was defined as the need for pre\u2010emptive or curative induction therapy with ganciclovir. Pre\u2010emptive treatment was started with a half\u2010dose therapy of ganciclovir when the CMV antigenemia assay results showed 1 to 10 antigen\u2010expressing cells/200 000 polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and induction therapy was started when the results showed more than 10 antigens expressing cells/200 000 polymorphonuclear leucocytes. For drugs already being administered, we noted the following: antibiotics or antifungal agents intravenously injected; inotropic or vasopressors; and immunosuppressants including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids as prophylaxis or treatment of transplantation\u2010related complications. According to the analysis of accompanying medical conditions, an early predictor of mortality was defined as a statistically significant comorbidity occurring with PCs within 48 hours of PI initiation.",

Expectorated sputum from older children and adolescents may be useful; however, samples from the nasopharynx and throat have no predictive value for bacterial cultures.33 Because of this, in our study, Gram stain and culture of sputum was conducted in only 45% of episodes while a viral study was conducted in 90% of episodes. To differentiate infectious aetiologies, indirect tests were additionally performed (such as serology and radiologic evaluations) in over 80% of episodes. Recently, several authors have emphasized the importance of high\u2010resolution CT in the diagnosis of PCs after HSCT. However, specifying PC types on the basis of a CT scan alone is difficult, and no specific CT findings exist to indicate treatment modification.34, 35 Therefore, to precisely distinguish the aetiology of PCs, invasive work\u2010ups with BAL or LB are inevitable. In previous studies, BAL was performed in up to 88% of adult recipients and 43% of paediatric HSCT recipients with 30%\u201073% diagnostic yields.1, 2, 5, 10, 36, 37 LB also yielded a specific diagnosis in 41%\u201094% of lung infiltrates,5, 6, 9, 37 especially for non\u2010infectious PCs. The overall diagnostic yield of invasive tests in our study was similar (63.6%) and increased up to 77.8% in the group with negative results on the non\u2010invasive tests. However, the majority of episodes (49%) were diagnosed using the non\u2010invasive tests, and BAL and LB were performed in only 18% and 10% of the total episodes, respectively. Nevertheless, the mortality rate was lower (30.6%) in the present study compared to previous reports of paediatric recipients.1, 38\n",

Consistent with previous studies,2, 4, 10 we found that the modification of treatment based on examination results (performed in 29 episodes; 60.0%) did not influence the outcome. In contrast, Yoo et al8 reported an affirmative effect of therapeutic modification following procedures for diffuse PI causing respiratory failure in cancer patients. However, their study may not generalize to HSCT patients as it was limited to a specialized ICU for critically ill cancer patients. Furthermore, most physicians decide treatment based on not only aetiologic diagnoses, but also responsiveness to empirical treatment and clinical experiences. Thus, it is difficult to find a direct effect of aetiologic diagnosis and treatment modification on outcomes without consideration of the medical condition. However, the previously mentioned studies on PCs did not analyse comorbidities, which occur in the majority of recipients following transplantation, and may affect treatment choice and outcome. Our study extensively investigated the predictors of outcome through the inclusion of comorbidities, as well as aetiologic diagnosis and treatment modifications. Although our study did not find a relationship between treatment modification and outcome, targeted therapy according to the evaluation result is still recommended (such as early de\u2010escalation antibiotics) and may lead to other positive effects including lower levels of multidrug resistant bacteria and medication toxicity.",

TA\u2010TMA, which has a high mortality rate, is also known to occur as a result of vascular endothelial damage.44 In our study, one case with viral pneumonia, coexisting with TA\u2010TMA, died because of MODS. Among several organs, pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous system dysfunction have shown similar findings in laboratory tests such as low anticoagulant protein C and antithrombin III, and clinical outcomes such as subsequent other organ dysfunction and death.39, 40, 41 In the multivariate analysis, organ dysfunction at the beginning of the PI was found to be the most significant prognostic factor in patients with PCs following HSCT. Recipients with PI who also suffered from hepatic dysfunction more frequently had a poor outcome. Half of patients with hepatic dysfunction had co\u2010occurring VOD. Although the number of patients was too small to evaluate outcomes according to the cause of hepatic dysfunction, it could be presumed that VOD, as the common cause of liver dysfunction, might be related to mortality in patients with PCs. In addition, whatever the cause, hepatic dysfunction in an early stage of respiratory distress, rather than in an advanced stage, may aggravate respiratory failure and other organ dysfunction, leading to a poor outcome.",

In the present study, the platelet level was lower in episodes with MODS compared to that in episodes without MODS; however, thrombocytopaenia was not related to final mortality. Instead, neutropaenia was an early prognostic factor of mortality. Unexpected neutropaenia after HSCT results from several causes including infection, GVHD, drug\u2010induced myelosuppression, antibody\u2010mediated neutropaenia, and graft failure.46, 47 Neutropenic recipients are exposed to the risk of opportunistic infection, which is difficult to overcome and increases mortality. After dividing the patients into two groups by aetiology, neutropaenia was significantly associated with poor outcome among infectious causes, but not among non\u2010infectious causes. Similar to previous studies, we reported a relationship between organ dysfunction and mortality; however, the present study focused on recipients with PIs and the early predictors of mortality, rather than all recipients of HSCT and already critically ill patients. After organ dysfunctions worsen, patients could transfer to the PICU for extracorporeal organ support. Among recipients with PIs, 21 episodes required PICU admission and only 30% survived. Interestingly, there was no difference in days from the diagnosis to PICU admission for those who survived and those who did not. We may assume that simple organ supportive care with early transfer to the PICU is not enough to inhibit the progression from MODS to mortality. However, no established therapies for organ dysfunction yet exist, although a few molecular targeted therapies have been studied.48 Therefore, further studies on organ dysfunction treatments are needed to improve outcomes.",

Second, due to the study's retrospective nature, a selection bias may have influenced the results. Third, our patient group was too small to draw powerful conclusions. However, the present study adds to the literature by focusing on the importance of comorbidities and organ dysfunction, which are often neglected in studies focusing on diagnoses. In addition, the adjusted multivariable analysis served to minimize the potential for selection bias. Finally, the lack of the results for pulmonary function tests before and after HSCT is a limitation of our study. However, about 40% of recipients were children younger than 5 years old, so the lung function tests could not be performed routinely and therefore could not be used as a relative factor of PCs.",
