Vectorial transport through the secretory pathway is maintained because different organelles recruit different GTPases and specific tethering proteins able to direct interactions between transport vesicles and acceptor membranes. Vesicle fusion is consolidated by pairing between SNARE proteins [6], [7]. The Arf1 GTPase regulates the formation of COPI coated vesicles which form at Golgi membranes to carry cargo back to the ER. COPII coated vesicles assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and carry proteins and lipids to the ERGIC and Golgi where docking and fusion are controlled by Rab1 and Golgi tethering proteins such as p115, GM130 and Golgin-84. The functions of other Rab proteins are described when they appear in the text.",

Early SP and SCV maturation result in recruitment of Rab 5 and several Rab5 effector proteins which normally control endocytosis. Sorting nexins may facilitate shrinkage of the SP [11] during formation of the SCV, while Rab5 effectors such as early endosome antigen 1 prime the SCV for progress along the endocytic pathway. SCV lose Rab5 and accumulate Rab7, LAMP1 and acidify. Rab7 recruits Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) which links the SCV to the dynein motor protein allowing movement to the Golgi and MTOC [12]. This, coupled with acidification of the vacuole, activates secretion of bacterial Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) proteins which are needed for continued Golgi positioning and replication. The Pip2B and SifA proteins recruit host kinesin interacting protein SKIP to the SCV to displace kinesin and inhibit outward movement [13], [14]. SifA may also impair the Rab7-RILP interaction to release dynein [12]. SseF and SseG locate to the surface of the vacuole where they may tether the vacuoles to the Golgi [15], [16]. Golgi positioning may also involve SipA and SifA proteins, actin [17], and recruitment of myosin II [18].",

The exact pathway followed by the vesicles remains to be determined. Vacuoles recruit 18 different RabGTPases during maturation [20] showing complex interaction with the secretory pathway. Vesicles leaving the trans-Golgi network (TGN) accumulate next to the SCV, but do not appear to fuse [21], making it unclear whether they deliver nutrients. Interestingly, long thin tubules of membrane called Salmonella induced filaments (Sifs) containing endosomal and lysosomal markers extend from the SCVs soon after positioning at the Golgi. Sifs require secretion of SPI-2 proteins, SseF and SseG, and extend towards the cell periphery along microubules where they recruit Rab9 and Rab11 and take up fluid phase endocytic markers [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Sifs may provide nutrients to bacteria from outside the cell by fusing with vesicles trafficking between late endosomes and the Golgi.",

Chlamydia does not interact with the endosomal/lysosomal pathway [25] but, as seen for Salmonella, the inclusions recruit dynein and migrate along microtubules to a peri-Golgi position [26], and again peri-Golgi positioning at the MTOC is required for replication. Inclusions receive sphingomyelin and cholesterol from exocytic vesicles that would normally deliver lipids from the TGN to the plasma membrane [27], [28], [29], [30] and can also gain lipids directly from lipid storage organelles called lipid droplets. This involves the bacterial Lda3 protein which may link lipid droplets to the outer surface of the inclusion [31]. Chlamydia infection also results in proteolysis of tethering protein Golgin 84 by caspases leading to fragmentation of the Golgi into ministacks. Inhibition of Golgi fragmentation reduces replication and also prevents the delivery of lipids to the inclusion suggesting that fragmented Golgi ministacks provide vesicles able to fuse with the vacuole [32]. Non-lipid nutrients can also be delivered to Chlamydia inclusion by endocytosis and fusion with multivesicular bodies (MVB) [33].",

            "text": "\nChlamydia effector proteins called \u2018integral inclusion membrane\u2019 (Inc) proteins recruit several RabGTPases to the inclusions [34]. Mature inclusions recruit Rab4 and Rab11 [35], [36], which are generally present in recycling endosomes and could interact with incoming MVBs. Inclusions recruit Rab1, which may activate tethering and subsequent fusion with Golgi-derived vesicles or ministacks. Rab6 and Rab10, which are involved in Golgi trafficking, are associated with inclusions in a species-dependent manner [35]. Rab recruitment requires the GTP-bound form suggesting that the Inc proteins act as Rab effector proteins. Inc protein Cpn0585, has coiled coil domains that share sequence similarity with Rab effectors such as the tethering proteins Golgin 84 and Golgi matrix protein GM130, and interacts with Rab1, Rab10 and Rab11 [37]. Whether Cpn0585 plays a role in Golgi fragmentation seen during infection has not been tested. IncA proteins such as CT813 have SNARE motifs and interact directly with host SNAREs that facilitate vesicle fusion [38]. The glutamate residue in the SNARE-like motif of IncA suggests similarity with Q-SNAREs that would interact with R-SNAREs. This is consistent with co-precipitation of Vamp3, Vamp7 and VAMP8 with IncA, and location of Vamp8 in the inclusion membrane. The precise role the SNARE homologues play in inclusion formation is not known. They interact with SNAREs involved in endosome trafficking and may aid recruitment of MVBs to the inclusion.",

Inhaled bacteria infect alveolar macrophages and become surrounded by a membrane compartment called the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), which avoids interactions with the endosomal/lysosomal pathway [39]. The LCVs quickly recruit Arf1 and Rab1 GTPases, and associate with vesicles containing ER and ERGIC markers, suggesting recruitment of vesicles trafficking between ER and Golgi compartments. Membrane vesicles remain associated with the LCV for several hours during which time the LCVs lose Rab1 and Arf1 [40], [41]. The vesicles tethered to the LCV [42] eventually fuse with the vacuole and deliver ER markers, and this is coincident with the onset of replication. Delivery is inhibited by Brefeldin-A, and a dominant negative Sar1[H79G] GTPase slows bacterial replication, suggesting involvement of COPI and COPII transport vesicles [42].",

Inhibition of replication by BFA has led to a model where viral activation of Arf-GEFs would recruit Arf1, and Arf effector proteins, needed to recruit membranes into replication compartments [52]. This is supported by genome-wide interference screens where COPI proteins are important for replication of both animal and plant picornaviruses [53], [54], and is consistent with the increase in Arf-GTP levels seen in cells following poliovirus infection. Moreover, Arf-1 and Arf-GEF proteins GBF1 and BIG1/2 are recruited into replication complexes [55], [56], and poliovirus replication is inhibited by siRNA for GBF1 [57]. Sequestration of Arf-1 into the replication complex would also explain the block in secretion seen in infected cells [58].",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus replication occurs within a web of ER membranes. The NS5A protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the web and recruits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B. Both NS5A and NS5B bind VAMP associated proteins (VAPs) [74], [75]. NS5B binds to a coiled coil domain (CCD) in VAP that resembles the CCD of SNARE proteins. Silencing VAP-B reduces the stability of NS5B, and depletion of VAP-B from cell free assays reduces RNA replication. Current models suggest that a VAPA/B heterodimer forms a scaffold that supports the replication complex. VAP proteins also bind to SNAREs involved in ER to Golgi transport, making it is possible that the VAP scaffold also facilitates membrane fusion to generate the membrane web from the ER. This may be true for other (+) strand RNA viruses such as Norwalk virus where membrane-bound nsp48 also binds VAP-A [76].",

TBC1D20 activates Rab1 GTP hydrolysis, and since depletion of TBC1D20 and Rab1 greatly reduce HepC replication [77], [78] it is likely that activation of Rab1-GTP is in some way involved in virus infection. Local blockade of Rab1 could, for example direct transport vesicles to make membrane webs. Rab5 is also recruited to the replication complex [79] by binding to NS4B, and virus-induced membranes recruit Rab5 effectors EEA1, rabaptin 5 and Rab4 suggesting the web may fuse with endosomes. A functional role for Rab5 in viral genome replication is suggested because dominant negative Rab5 reduces replication of replicons, and partial silencing of Rab5 reduces synthesis of viral RNA.",

            "text": "The studies described above set the stage or further work where it will be important to analyse interactions between host and microbial proteins at a structural level, and see how these interactions contribute to virulence and/or immune evasion. The work also provides a precedent for studies on other pathogens that use membrane compartments for replication. Brucella for example, traffic through lysosomes before fusing with the ER [80], and Coxiella replicate in a spaceous parasitophorous vacuole formed from secondary lysosomes [81]. Recent work on coronaviruses draws parallels with poliovirus where SARS-CoV replicates within densely packed membranes [82], and mouse hepatitis virus shows sensitivity to BFA and requires GBF1 mediated Arf1 activation [83], [84]. Disruption or use of the Golgi is not restricted to the (+) strand RNA viruses. The negative strand RNA Bunyaviruses replicate in the Golgi apparatus where they form tubes that contain replicase proteins [85]. The large DNA viruses such as Fowlpox encode homologues of SNAP proteins involved in SNARE pairing [86], while African Swine Fever virus replicates at the MTOC, slows secretion, and causes Golgi fragmentation and microtubule-dependent loss of the TGN [87]. ASFV also encodes a multigene family of proteins with C-terminal KEDL sequences able to interfere with KDEL-receptor mediated ER to Golgi trafficking and redistribute ER proteins to the ERGIC [88]. In all these cases the consequences of modulating the early secretory pathway in the context of virus survival and/or pathogenesis remain to be discovered.",

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) exchange GDP for GTP and allow the activated GTPase to bind effector proteins which facilitate vesicle budding and fusion. The cycle is completed by GTP-hydrolysis, which requires GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), followed by extraction of the GDP-bound enzyme from the membrane by GDI.",
