            "text": "Functionalization of natural compounds exhibiting native biological activity is one of the most efficient approaches for the synthesis of biologically active substances in medicinal chemistry. Symmetric nitrogen-containing molecules bearing at least two natural fragments linked with a spacer have become widely used for medical applications. The type of natural fragments is rather diverse: alkaloids, steroids, mono- or diterpenes, etc. Thus, dimeric and trimeric compounds, which exhibited a strongly pronounced antitumor effect, have been synthesized based on artemizinine.1 Hybrids of steroid framework have been studied as analogues of juvenile hormones.2 The strategy of bivalent ligands has been successfully implemented for searching for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The alkaloids tarcine3 and galanthamine4 were used as starting natural compounds, and their bis-derivatives appeared promising agents for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There are some examples in the literature of dimeric molecules acquiring properties that are completely different from those of the precursor molecules.5 Indeed, symmetric derivatives of the alkaloid camphotecine enhance solubility of a compound, reduce its toxicity, and increase its specific interaction with an enzyme.6 Meanwhile, symmetric compounds containing two quaternary nitrogen atoms separated by different size spacers are generally known to exhibit high biological activity.7 These agents have been most widely used as myorelaxants.8, 9 Furthermore, many of them have been tested as antimalarial drugs.10, 11 However, very few examples of synthesis of dimeric compounds based on natural molecules linked to quaternary nitrogen atoms via spacers have been published. For example, ammonium derivatives of the diterpenoids steviol and isosteviol exhibited antimicrobial properties12 and dimeric steroids can acts as a catalyst13 Hence, synthesis of compounds containing several natural fragments linked with spacer groups, involving the insertion of two quaternized nitrogen atoms, is a promising trend in chemistry of biologically active substances.",

Among other types of activity, we have investigated their ability to suppress the reproduction of influenza virus. Several examples of use of similar cage structures as anti-viral compounds are well known. Adamantane derivatives amantadine and rimantadine were the first antivirals against influenza. Isoborneol derivatives were also shown to possess antiviral activity against influenza virus.14, 15 Based on the amino derivatives of isoborneol, anti-influenza drug deitiforin was licensed in the former Soviet Union for influenza treatment. Its mechanism of activity was supposed to be similar to that of rimantadine. Several attempts were undertaken to optimize the molecule of amantadine and to overcome the virus\u2019 resistance.16, 17, 18, 19 In particular, adamantane-based spiro-derivatives have been tested against influenza virus and demonstrated high inhibiting activity. In this regard, activity of spiro[piperidine-2,2\u2032-adamantane] appeared comparable with that of amantadine while other 2-alkyl-2-aminoadamantanes appeared less effective. Moreover, none of them demonstrated an activity against influenza B virus thus suggesting the specific target for their activity that is absent in influenza B viruses.",

It was previously shown that (1R,2R,3R,5S)-3-pinanamine appeared more potent than amantadine in inhibiting amantadine-susceptible influenza virus.22 Moreover, although at relative high concentrations, some of pinanamine derivatives were able to inhibit amantadine-resistant mutant bearing S31N mutation, the fact suggesting the principal possibility to overcome the resistance of influenza viruses to adamantane derivatives using cage scaffold-based compounds. The target of adamantane derivatives is virus-specific proton channel M2. Initially, these compounds were supposed to interact with the internal channel of M2 protein. In general, in their protonated form these compounds are considered to block the tetrameric M2 ion channel pore, formed by its transmembrane domain and hence, its proton transport function. Amino acid substitutions conferring rimantadine-resistant phenotype are localized at positions 27, 28, 31 and 34. In 2008\u20132009, NMR solution revealed another adamantane-binding site around the amino acid position 44.23, 24 This study suggested that rimantadine bound to the outside of the M2 protein helices facing the lipid bilayer with residue D44 participating in a hydrogen bond interaction with rimantadine. It was postulated that the high-affinity binding site corresponded to the M2 ion channel pore; whereas the secondary, low-affinity binding site could be attributed to the lipid face of the pore. These two studies proposed different sites of and different models for the interaction of adamantane drugs with M2 first, anion channel pore-binding model and, second, the lipid-facing binding model.25 In the later case, the drug was shown to inhibit the channel from outside by an allosteric mechanism by stabilizing its closed state.",

Narrow pore of the channel restricts the size and charge of compounds that must fit the pore in order to inhibit it effectively. On the other hand, when developing the compounds interacting with amino acids and/or lipid bilayer from outside the channel, one may use a much wider set of side substituents. In this case, other factors become important for binding, in particular, the ability of a compound to interact simultaneously with lipids of membrane bilayer and external amino acids of the transmembrane region of M2.",

These compounds, similar to those synthesized in the course of our study, are based on cage structure (adamantane for amantadine and rimantadine; isoborneol for deitiforin and compounds 3a\u2013g and 4a, b). As indicated previously, the influenza A virus contains a proton-selective ion channel (M2) that is the target of the adamantane family of drug inhibitors. Despite structure similarity of camphor derivatives to rimantadine and deitiforin, some of them appeared active against pandemic influenza strain that is resistant to adamantane derivatives. This suggests that the target site for our compounds should include amino acids differing from those interacting with rimantadine (27, 28, 31 and 34). Indeed, molecular modeling of interaction of dimeris camphor derivative 3a with M2 revealed that it preferentially binds with two adjacent chains of M2 tetramer (Fig. 2\n) in the region of amino acids 40\u201354. This model allows a speculation of why linkers of specific length confers the symmetric dimeric derivatives of camphor higher activity comparing to monomers. As M2 is a tetramer consisting of four peptides, there are four sites in the M2 molecule able to interact with camphor derivative as it is presented in the figure. Combination of two camphor moieties in one molecule might increase a probability of M2 binding and increase the strength of such binding, especially if these two moieties are linked with each other by linker of appropriate length allowing to reach two binding sites. In other words, if two camphor moieties are linked, binding of one moiety to the M2 target increases a probability of binding of second moiety to neighboring binding site of M2 comparing to two independent molecules. This suggestion undoubtedly should be a subject for further study.",

The antiviral activity, cyto- and genotoxicity of the resulting compounds have been studied. Compound 3d, in which the quaternary nitrogen atoms are separated by the \u04219H18 aliphatic chain, exhibited the highest efficiency as an agent inhibiting the reproduction of the influenza virus (strain A/California/07/09 (H1N1)pdm09). The therapeutic index of this compound is more than 10-fold higher than those of the comparative drugs, amantadine and rimantadine. It is worth mentioning that the synthesized camphor imines are stable crystalline compounds that undergo neither destruction nor polymerization for a long period. The cytotoxicity data of compounds 3 and 4 demonstrate that they exhibit a moderate anticancer activity; compound 3f had the highest activity for the CEM-13 cell line. These results show close agreement with the data of independent studies on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of these compounds. Compounds 3e and 3f exhibit the highest toxicity. After further detailed study, these compounds can be of interest in terms of their putative application as components of drugs for suppressing malignant tumor development.",

The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added to the cellular culture at the required concentrations. Cells were placed on 96-well microliter plates and cultivated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2/95% air for 72 h. Three wells were used for each concentration. The cells which were incubated without the compounds were used as a control. The cell viability was assessed through an MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] conversion assay. 1% MTT was added to each well. Four hours later DMSO was added and mixed for 15 min. Finally, the optical density values were monitored at 570 nm.",
