Intelligence detection in extra-solar system locales depends on the presence of life or on the presence of machines. Can these be detected? What is the extent of contamination with biological and junked material of the prior pristine extra-terrestrial environments in our Solar System? Have all the planets, asteroids, and planetesimals to which spacecraft were sent already damaged and contaminated the entire program of life detection in our solar system with biological, toxic, and junk contamination? In case terrestrial and extra-terrestrial biologies were similar, can biological hybrids form that are more pathogenic or toxic compared to either parental progenitor? Is this a danger even if they are dissimilar? Will this admonition endure with spacecraft having departed from our solar system? The highest level of biosafety biocontainment level (BSL-4) is used for the deadliest of known terrestrial viruses, such as Ebola virus. The severe problem of extraterrestrial contamination by terrestrial microbes and vice versa, the reverse possibility, requires careful and detailed examination, analysis, and technological improvement. Assessment of many constraints requires that intelligent machines sent to investigate life beyond the solar system, should have preeminent capabilities including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum computers (QC), robotics, self-replication, and repair, nanotechnology, and von Neumann\u2019s \u201cUniversal Constructor\u201d. It is counter-productive to foster human exploration of life beyond the solar system, current human, financial, and technological conditions all considered. This chapter briefly provides synopses of diverse background and significant advances for virology/life detection elsewhere, within and beyond the solar system.1",

Their eggs are found in river beds and the next stage of development, nymphs, are found in proximity on river water plants. Subsequently, two separate additional adult stages develop on other riverside plants [18]. Consequently, if the investigators happened to look at night, or with inappropriate durations, or miss any of the precise locales, such explorers might not detect such mayflies.

Much work is currently being accomplished and the paradigm shift from utilization of humans to utilization of AI will accelerate the understanding and implementation of what needs to be done in preparation for such explorations. Additionally, large intelligent mechanical inventive systems necessitate development, which will implement obligatory changes upon arrival at extra-solar system target locales.

Ubiquitous dangerous and deleterious effects of lunar dust were included in ten categories: inhalation and irritation, vision obscuration, false instrument readings, dust coating and contamination, astronaut space suit surfaces, loss of traction, thermal control problems, abrasion, clogging of mechanisms, and ball-bearing and seal failures. There were no effective procedures available to diminish the most serious problems of abrasion, clogging, and weakened heat rejection. The authors concluded that prior studies of these problems had been insufficient, so that additional studies will be needed prior to returning to the Moon and similarly prior to exploring Mars, if that is done. 21st Century ultra-sterile futuristic BSL-4 methods to prevent material and biological contamination should be used [25\u201329].",

For example, carbonaceous chondrites have been sources of amino acids, purines, and perhaps some pyrimidines. Do they reflect conditions related to the origin of life or synthesis during transit to the earth\u2019s surface? [50\u201353]. First, were compounds continually produced during the early history of the solar system (e.g. during the first Gyr) and then, second, various conditions would degrade and destroy these compounds (e.g. heat, impacts, radiation, radioactivity, ultraviolet light, cosmic rays, and solar wind.) Olivine basalt was returned from the lunar regolith to the Cornell University Space Center Planetary Laboratory (Ithaca, NY) and was pulverized and then mixed with amino acids. These mixtures were subjected to lunar surface proton irradiation, temperature, and high vacuum, and resulted in complete amino acid destruction, in entirety, in 5-cm mixture columns. The half-life of the amino acids was calculated at 4000 years [54].",

Moreover, many proteins have prion-like sequences and may additionally participate in various disease processes. Unanticipated, amyloid fibril fatal associated involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, may involve synergistic action with prions. Further relevant to Astrovirology, there is negligible immune response to prion disease itself (transmissible encephalopathies) in the natural setting.

It was suggested that due to various complex calculations, such interstellar visitors have been missed previously. However, it could not be traveled to by direct means. 1I/2017 U1 was initially identified as probably an asteroid, but not a comet. It traversed our solar system with a jolt from the Sun that assisted its hyperbolic exit. It was oblong shaped, with axes that were 200 by 20 meters. Spectroscopic analysis indicated it had a red color, coated with damaged or degraded organic molecules of some kind, and possibly hollow (perhaps with or without trapped internal ice). It was also reported that, unfortunately, we did not have any rockets prepared, which could reach the object and place a probe on it to plot its path as it exited the Solar system beyond visual range. Could laser technology have been used to extend the tracking range [122\u2013124].",

Moreover, 1I/2017 U1 may have been involved in a collision in the distant past, perhaps the cause of its expulsion from the solar system from which it originated [125]. Analysis of the object for signs or signatures of life remain indefinite. Loeb, in 2018, [126] proposed an artificial extraterrestrial interstellar origin for 1I/2017 U1. Of further interest is the proposal of a few stars, originally, calculated to within 2 pc of 1I/2017 U1 as possible prior sources with ranges of distance and travel times of 0.6 pc at 1 Mya and 1.6 pc at 3.8 Mya [127].

Suttle and others had previously point out that there are approximately 1030 viruses, currently, in the Earth\u2019s oceans and that viruses have a huge impact globally \u2013 that they exhibit the widest genetic diversity on Earth, cause mortality, affect phytoplankton (one of the bases of the ecosystem and food chain on the planet), and drive geochemical cycles.

There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life, so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. Be that as it may, it is agreed that life shapes the milieu in which viruses evolve (and vice versa.)",

Space agencies and their governments have been well aware of the problems of biological contamination from Earth of extraterrestrial places to be visited and explored.

Examples of problems already in progress include innumerable artificial satellites orbit the Earth, many have been sent to orbit Mars, the Moon, and other planets, asteroids, and comets, etc. and many probes have crashed or landed on Mars, the Moon, as well as other objects, and several have been propelled out of the solar system. Consequently, these need to be fully catalogued and inventoried to ascertain more fully the extent of the contamination by terrestrial microorganisms and materials that contaminated these probes. This microbial contamination problem is being addressed from a peer review and public perspective and should be corrected before further exacerbations of the problems are continued [181, 182].",

In addition, some Martian and terrestrial organisms could produce new life forms (by synergistic (symbiotic) interactions as well as inter-breeding, depending on their \u2018biochemistries\u2019), which could then be pathogenic and have unanticipated stark effects. Surely, as one surveys the history of terrestrial catastrophic epidemics and pandemics, most were unanticipated and should be lessons not to under-rate the aggressiveness of many life-forms. Thus, in summary, pathogenicity to any terrestrial life could result from Martian organisms, terrestrial organisms that were conveyed to Mars, and pathogenicity could result in the Martian and terrestrial contexts, including new organisms that interbred. In the obverse, terrestrial life could be inimical to Martian life. This applies to all such exoplanetary explorations.",
