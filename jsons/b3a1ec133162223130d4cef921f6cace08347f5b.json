Generated Fe 2 C 6 and Fe 2 C 12 are shown to be more cohesive than the mono-carbide on one hand, and increasingly cohesive from hexa-C 6 to dodeca-C 12 on the other hand. From energy differences, the ground state is spin-polarized SP, versus a non-spin-polarized NSP configuration, and identified as ferromagnetic versus a higher energy anti-ferromagnetic hypothesis. The projection of the magnetic charge density on Fe and C, shows that only Fe carries the magnetic moment, while carbon receives charges from Fe as illustrated by the electron localization function ELF 3D and 2D mapping. SP configuration induces an enlarged c/a hexagonal ratio, versus NSP, while a(hex.) remains constant thanks to the rigid C 6 carbon substructure network, resulting in an anisotropic magneto-volume response. This feature essentially due to in-plane diiron is discussed from the energy-volume (E, V) NSP and SP equations of state EOS and derived quantities like volume and d(Fe-Fe) change of the magnetization.",

            "text": "In paramagnetic elements, a lowering of the energy occurs when the electron spins align, and in certain cases below a critical temperature called the Curie temperature T C , a longrange ferromagnetic order establishes as the ground state. Regarding the highest occupied valence states of the 1 st -period transition metals Fe, Co and Ni are ferromagnetic with noninteger magnetic moments: 2.12, 1.69 and 0.86 \uf06d B respectively. They are characterized by the onset of magnetic order through \"inter d-band spin polarization\", implying that the magnetic moments on the 3d sub-shells are mediated by itinerant electrons between them, in a \"d\u2026.s\u2026.d\"-like bridging between adjacent sites. The other condition for the onset of magnetic moments is the width of the nd band (n= 3, 4, 5) which increases along with the n series. The consequence is that mostly 3d metals are magnetically ordered, versus 4d and 5d characterized by a broad d-band and subsequent insufficient localization. Oppositely, the 4f states (and some 5f) are more localized in a narrow band and they keep this behavior in the organized periodic solid. Rare-earth Gadolinium [Xe] 4f 7 5d 1 6s 2 is characterized by half-filled 4f sub-shell. All 7 electrons polarize to provide a high magnetic moment of 7 \uf06d B within a mechanism of \"intra f-band spin polarization\" [1] .",

The hexagonal crystal structure contains two diiron pairs with d(Fe-Fe) = 2.52 \u00c5, equal to the sum of two Fe atomic radii, thus highlighting a covalent-like bond. Metal-metal bonding in dinuclear complexes are shown to play a key role in inorganic and organometallic chemistry synthesis [4] . A similar situation occurs in orthorhombic Fe 2 C diiron carbide, characterized by d(Fe-Fe) larger than the covalent sum with 2.66 \u00c5 [5 (cf. Fig. 1a) . Further, theoretical investigations within the well-established quantum density functional theory DFT [6, 7] let propose a hexagonal phase of Fe 2 C in space group P6 3 /mmc (N\u00b0194), containing similarly diiron interlayered with carbon [8] (cf. Fig. 1b) . However, the carbon network is limited in extension. This observation is relevant given recent investigation within DFT of the stabilization of Fe and Co single atoms in extended carbon hexagonal C 6 networks [9] . FeC 6 and CoC 6 were characterized in the ferromagnetic ground state with integer magnetic moments (M Fe = 2 \uf06d B , and M Co = 1 \uf06d B ) within an \"intra d-band spin polarization\", similarly to a 4f element as Gd.",

The crystal parameter x C~0 .33 is the same in both compounds, which is expected in so far that it rules the C 6 planar network. In Fe 2 C 12 the additional z C ruling the relative position of the C 6 layer (cf. Fig. 1e ) along with the c hexagonal vertical axis, changes from 0.244 in NSP to 0.236 in SP while c/a ration increases. All these results are consistent in describing a lattice along with a,b planar direction i.e. within C 6 , more rigid than between planes i.e., along c: C 6 /Fe2/C 6 . Energetically, the effect of going from the hexa-diiron to the dodeca-diiron is the large increase of the cohesive energy from -1.065 eV to -1.543 eV.",

Also, the inter Fe-Fe distances are shown for the minimal calculated values in the SP configurations. While d(Fe-Fe) ~2.60 \u00c5 in diiron carbide Fe 2 C, both hexagonal new diiron -C systems have d(Fe-Fe) ~2.50 \u00c5. It is expected that the magnetization magnitude will be Fe-Fe separation as developed in the next sections for the most cohesive Fe 2 C 12 . Figure 3 shows the electron localization function ELF meant to highlight the different behavior of carbon in orthorhombic Fe 2 C versus the hexagonal phases. In Fig. 3a , the 3D volumes of electron localization are observed around C only whereas no localization volumes are to be seen around Fe. This is also observed for Fe pairs in Figs. 3b) and 3c) but the shape of the ELF is different from Fig. 3a) where the electron localization is between carbon atoms forming the C 6 network, observed completely in Fe 2 C 12 , where the whole two C 6 substructures are within the unit cell. The electron localization is further stressed through the ELF 2D slice crossing the Fe-Fe plane, in a supercell 2\uf0b42\uf0b41 projection for a clear representation. The dominant blue color signals zero electron localization, which is expected from the departure of electrons Fe\uf0aeC; but between diiron pairs, the localization if of light blue to green color, signaling a nearly free-electron like, electron gas distribution. Then it can be concluded that iron pairs interact through the electron gas as presented in the introduction.",

Also since the major difference between NSP and SP is in the magnitude of the hexagonal c/a ratio, we show in Fig. 4c the plot of magnetization against c/a ratio, knowing that the equilibrium value is around 1.65. One observes that the effect is of small magnitude (the y-axis is extended to show details). Oppositely in Fig. 4d ), the change with the Fe-Fe separation is more significant and the scattered points follow the M(V) curve in Fig. 4b) . It can be concluded that Fe 2 C 12 magnetization has an anisotropic response to compression, whereby the main component of magnetization is in-plane. Also in so far that the magnetization remains constant over a broad range of volume and d(Fe-Fe) around minima (cf. Figs. 4b and 4d ).

The electronic structure calculation provides the total energy of E Tot =-16.44 eV. Here and in the following calculations, the cohesive energy is obtained by subtraction the energy of Fe in a large box (10\uf0b410\uf0b410 \u00c5): -7.55 eV from the total electronic energy, leading to E coh = -1.34 eV, or E coh = -0.67 eV/at.

The physics underlying this procedure is that the calculated total energy corresponds to the cohesion within the crystal in as far as the solution of the Kohn-Sham DFT equations gives the energy for infinitely separated electrons and nuclei. But the zero of energy depends on the choice of the potentials, then energy becomes arbitrary through its shifting, not scaling. However, the energy derivatives, as well as the equation of states, remain unaltered. The NSP and SP E(V) curves in Fig. 4a show a quadratic shape. They are fitted with an energy-volume Birch EOS up to the 3 rd order [19]: E(V) = E o (V o ) + [9/8]V o B o [([(V o )/V]) 2/3 -1] 2 + [9/16]B o (B ' -4)V o [([(V o )/V]) 2/3 -1] 3 7",

The lower energy part corresponds to carbon DOS which are equal in position and magnitude for both spin channels (no spin polarization), oppositely to the higher energy part corresponding to Fe DOS which are of unequal weight for the two spin channels: spin polarization and development of Fe magnetic moments. They are crossed by the Fermi level (E F ).
