The genotypes in genogroups GI, GII, and GIV, referred to collectively as human norovirus (HuNoV), are a major cause of acute water- and food-borne outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis worldwide [1], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. HuNoV is responsible for more than 90% of viral gastroenteritis and more than 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks; this virus causes acute diarrhea and vomiting, which typically resolve within 2 or 3 days, but can result in life-threatening dehydration in children and the elderly [7], [11].",

Hence, electron microscopy, immunological tests, electrochemical sensing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular assays have been adopted to detect NoV [14]. Despite the fact that electrochemical biosensing, using NoV-specific aptamers, is rapid, sensitive and accurate, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) are the gold standards for NoV detection due to their wide applicability. However, sample preparation for these methods to detect viral contamination in food and water is complicated by factors such as large sample volumes, low viral titers, and compounds that interfere with nucleic acid amplification [15]. Methods available for NoV concentration, such as swab sampling, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultracentrifugation, cationic separation, immune concentration, and organic flocculation, have limitations due to their narrow pH ranges, time requirements, and difficulties in handling multiple samples at a time [16], [17]. Therefore, an alternative method is necessary to overcome the limitations of such methods.",

Furthermore, a rapid technique for use with PCR assay using specific primers for the detection of HuNoV was developed to concentrate specific HuNoV via Con A immobilization on polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB). This application was evaluated by measuring the recovery of different genotypes of GI and GII HuNoV from different food matrices at broad pH ranges. Overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of HuNoV will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections, especially HuNoV (GI and GII).",

Con A was induced with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 \u00b0C overnight. GII.4 VA387 was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at 16 \u00b0C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 7,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in 20 mL lysis solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mg/mL lysozyme) supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Switzerland). Samples were lysed by three passes through a French press disruptor (Stansted SPCH). The cleared lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) purification was performed on a 2 mL bed volume of glutathione agarose affinity resin (Pierce) pre-equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl). The lysate was then incubated with glutathione-agarose resins at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h on a rotator. To remove non-specific binding proteins, the resins were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 \u00d7 g for 3 min and washed five times with 10 resin-bed volumes of TBS. GST-tagged proteins were then eluted with TBS containing 10 mM GSH (3 mL). The purified proteins were appropriately concentrated using 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultra-15, Merck Millipore). The GST-tagged proteins were then treated with thrombin to liberate the fusion proteins, which were subsequently purified with a GSTrap FF (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and HiTrap Benzamidine FF columns (GE Healthcare), and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.",

Time-dependent HDX showed that the metal coordinated region (MCR), including Ile17, Gly18, and Asp19 of Con A (Fig. 1B and C), interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) as indicated by significant deuterium exchange alterations in this region from the Con A only and Con A-P-domain conjugated experiment. The structural analysis based on preliminary reports proposed that MCR is positioned on the outer region of Con A, and that it coordinated with metal ions including Mn2+ and Ca2+. The HDX results from Con A alone support that amino acids from Thr15 to Asp16 show high deuterium exchange rates, and Ile17 and Gly18 show to be rapidly changed starting from 5 s exposure (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). These results suggested that MCR may generate a complex between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A. Con A have shown that hetero-metal ions are essential for the proper orientation of the key residues that mediate the carbohydrate specific interactions with hydrogen bonds, but coordination is required to control the directions of the side and main chains in Con A. Our mutational studies of MCR and CBR confirmed that metal coordination is crucial for HuNoV (GII.4) interactions (shown below). In addition to these amino acid regions, the dimerization region (DR), which is involved in dimer formation in Con A, is slow to deuterium exchange as shown in Fig. 1D [33]. The results from time-dependent HDX suggested that Con A interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) primarily through the MCR, because the carbohydrate binding region (CBR) of Con A, including L99, Y100, does not show significant changes in deuterium exchange rate. The HDX results provide valuable information for the understanding of interactions between Con A and HuNoV (GII.4).",

When Con A interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4), the signal around 222 nm becomes more negative compared to that of GII.4 alone. This is because the CD spectra analysis enables the evaluation of changes in secondary structure including \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets of proteins. These changes in the CD spectra indicate alterations in structure, which could result from interactions between Con A and the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4).",

The dissociation constant (KD) value indicates the interaction kinetics of an analyte and ligand; the KD values for the interaction of native Con A, mCon ACBR, and mCon AMCR with HuNoV (GII.4) were 71.5 \u00b1 6.7 nM, 110.8 \u00b1 7.5 nM, and 22.0 \u00b1 17.0 \u03bcM, respectively. These values indicate that the interaction kinetics of mCon AMCR with HuNoV (GII.4) was greatly reduced compared to native Con A and mCon ACBR, suggesting that the MCR (residues 16\u201324) participates in the interaction with HuNoV (GII.4), whereas the CBR does not show significant changes in dissociation constant. A previous study reported that HuNoV interacts with carbohydrates [34], which suggests its binding to multiple monosaccharide moieties present in food materials. For example, glycan, a milk oligosaccharide, was reported to interact with HuNoV capsids [35]. Hydroxyl moieties in carbohydrates cause non-specific hydrogen bonding with the main and side chains of lectins [36], but the MCR of Con A was proposed as a major binding region of HuNoV (GII.4) through mutational studies. The mCon AMCR lost its binding affinity due to structural disruption of the MCR. The mutated residues of MCR and CBR in Con A (PDB accession: 3NWK) are depicted in mesh (Fig. 2B and C) [37]. In addition, apo-Con A (metal-free Con A) also showed decreased binding affinity when compared to metal-bound Con A (Fig. 3\n). This result indicates that chelating Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions with EDTA could affect the secondary structures required for specific interactions with HuNoV, which supports the involvement of the MCR in binding to HuNoV. The subtle differences in structure between metal coordinated- and apo-Con A were observed around the MCR in a superimposed image (Fig. 3B). These results proposed that metal ions coordinated through residues in the MCR were positioned properly to interact with HuNoV (GII.4), since the superimposed structures of the MCR proved that atoms from the side and main chains have different directions.",

SBA has a high structural similarity (r.m.s. = 0.846) to Con A (Fig. 4\nA); however, BLI assays demonstrated that SBA does not interact with HuNoV as shown in Fig. 4B. Results indicated that Con A had strong binding affinity, whereas mCon AMCR and SBA did not specifically interact with HuNoV (GII.4). Moreover, secondary structures including the overall loops located at the MCR and CBR are identical (PDB accession: 3NWK and 1SBD, Fig. 4A), although alignment of amino acid sequences suggested that the sequence identity between Con A and SBA is only 16% (Fig. 4C). The inability of SBA to interact with the HuNoV (GII.4) could be due to low sequence identity, despite almost identical structures. Furthermore, the MCR of Con A does not show sequence similarity to SBA. The MCR of these residues generates specific interactions with HuNoV (GII.4), because the amino acids of this site could potentially form specific secondary structures including \u03b1-helices and loops. These results indicated that the interaction between Con A and HuNoV (GII.4) is unique, in which HuNoV (GII.4) recognizes not only structural features, but also specific amino acid sequences.",

Thus, the application of Con A to concentrate HuNoV for the rapid detection of the virus in food was tested. The conventional PEG concentration method is both time consuming and has a low sampling number, which makes it a stumbling block for the rapid analysis of HuNoV. Instead, Con A-immobilized polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB) were developed, as explained in the methods section (Fig. 5\nA), to be used in our new concentration method. The ability and stability of Con A to detect HuNoV (GII.4) was tested over pH ranges from 3 to 10 as HuNoV is usually found in contaminated foods of varying pHs (Fig. 5B). The percentage of viral recovery was not significantly affected by changes in pH, demonstrating an advantage of using Con A-PAB as a concentration tool over some of the currently available methods. This attribute is an improvement over other HuNoV detection methods that are limited to a narrow range of pH [17]. HuNoV was detected up to 101 RT-PCR units/mL, which meets the standard PCR detection level. This method was successful in recovering HuNoV (GII.4), with a virus recovery (%) of more than 77% when samples were spiked with virus concentrations ranging from 103 to 106 RT-PCR units/mL as determined by PCR (Fig. 5C). Moreover, using Con A-PAB containing 3.0 g of Con A immobilized beads, the capacity of HuNoV (GII.4) capture was up to 104 copy numbers. However, the performance of the Con A-PAB could be enhanced by increasing the amount of Con A and the surface areas of the concentration tool. Using Con A-PAB, HuNoV recovery reached more than 90% in 15 min at an eluent flow rate of 13.5 mL/min (Fig. 5D). From these initial results, we found that the stability of Con A is great for detection, and it maintains interaction with HuNoV (GII.4) in a broad range of pHs and flow-rates, suggesting that the Con A-PAB could serve as a novel concentration tool with high recovery of HuNoV (GII.4). Besides this, Con A-PAB, a method based on solid phase extraction, has other advantages, such as ease of handling several samples concurrently and speed for concentration of the virus.",

Among seven HuNoV genogroups (GI  - GVII), GI and GII, consisting of 9 and 19 genotypes, respectively, are the most common cause of human infections. The binding specificity of Con A-PAB with these genotypes was analyzed in seven samples, comprising two and five different genotypes of the GI and GII genogroups, respectively. These genotypes had varying recoveries ranging from 41.8% to 90.6% (Fig. 6\nA, Supporting table 1). Among them, GII.4, which has been associated with the majority of global epidemics in the past decade [41], was recovered at the highest level (90.6%), followed by GII.2, GII.8, GII.17 and GII.6 (85.2%, 77.8%, 61.4 and 41.8% recovery, respectively). Among tested genotypes, GII.4, GII.2 and GII.6 are responsible for the majority (77.5%) of total HuNoV outbreaks in the US from 2009 to 2013 [42]. However, genotypes of GI including GI.3 and GI.8 were recovered at only 68.5% and 56.2% levels, respectively. The variability between GI and GII could be due to subtle differences in amino acid sequences between these subtypes. For example, the VP1 domains of HuNoV strains from the same genogroups have 70\u201390% P-domain sequence similarity; however, different genogroups have less than 50% sequence similarity [42], [43]. Superimposed structures of the P-domain of GI.8 and GII.4 show high structural similarity (r.m.s. = 1.15, C\u03b1 alignment), which may explain the ability of Con A to bind to the P-domain of both subtypes despite sequence differences (Fig. 6B). HuNoV from genogroup I shows different sequences from genogroup II, but GI.3 and GI.8 have greater than 50% recovery. The percentages of virus recovery of HuNoV from GII.2 and GII.4 were greater than 80% with the Con A-PAB when the virus copy number was higher than 103, which is sufficient to amplify the viral RNA in order to confirm HuNoV contamination in food samples. These results demonstrate that Con A-PAB can be successfully applied for the detection of HuNov (GII.2, GII.4, and GII.8) and other genotypes (GI.3, GI.8, GII.6, and GII.17).",

            "text": "The recovery of GII.4 from different food samples using Con A-PAB was compared to the recovery using the PEG precipitation method, which is usually recommended for a wide variety of viruses. Different food samples (200 mL) were spiked with 4.7 \u00d7 104 copies of HuNoV (GII.4). Tris-glycine beef extract buffer was used as an elution buffer for recovery of GII.4 from food samples [44]. The ability of Con A-PAB to concentrate the virus from different foods, such as lettuce, strawberries, and milk, was evaluated. Con A-PAB exhibited significantly higher viral recovery from lettuce compared to that of the PEG precipitation (p = 0.035). Both methods showed similar recovery from strawberries (Table 2\n). Interestingly, Con A-PAB was successful in recovering GII.4 from milk with 60.8% recovery, whereas the PEG method was not successful for this application. These results suggest that the performance of Con A-PAB is less affected by food types than PEG precipitation. Using Con A-PAB, the maximum level of HuNoV was recovered in 15 min, whereas PEG required more than 4\u20136 h. These results demonstrate that the use of Con A-PAB exhibits comparable viral recovery to the conventional PEG method, and enables faster concentration.",

            "text": "Biophysical assays in this study proved that Con A displayed strong interactions with HuNoV (GII.4), and these binding events were dependent on the MCR. The mutational studies of MCR and CBR proved that interaction between Con A and HuNoV are dependent on metal coordination and sequence around the MCR because SBA and apo-Con A did not show specific intractions to HuNov. These results proved that the orientations of side and main chains are critical for the generation of specific interactions with HuNoV (GII.4). A HuNoV concentration tool, Con A-PAB, was developed by adapting the simple operation principle of solid-phase extraction, which made it possible to handle multiple samples simultaneously. The tool was also capable of concentrating different GI and GII genotypes, although the viral recoveries showed variation due to their subtle differences in sequence and structure. The compatibility of the tool with PCR was demonstrated by 15 min concentration and detection of HuNoV from contaminated food samples (200 mL) using qRT-PCR. Although Con A had previously been shown to interact with enveloped viruses, this study demonstrated its potential for interaction with non-enveloped viruses (HuNoV). Despite the practical feasibility of concentrating HuNoV with Con A-PAB, the applicability of this tool should be further confirmed by competition with other non-enveloped viruses.",
