            "text": "The Golgi apparatus is the major site of protein, lipid and proteoglycan glycosylation. The glycosylation enzymes, as well as kinases and sulfatases that catalyze phosphorylation and sulfation, are localized within the Golgi cisternae in characteristic distributions that frequently reflect their order in a particular pathway (Kornfeld and Kornfeld 1985; Colley 1997) . The glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases and kinases are transferases that require activated donor molecules for the reactions they catalyze. For eukaryotic, fungal and protozoan glycosyltransferases these are the nucleotide sugars UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), GDPfucose (GDP-Fuc), CMP-sialic acid (CMP-Sia), UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), GDP-mannose (GDP-Man), and UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl) (Hirschberg et al. 1998) . For the kinases, ATP functions as the donor, while for the sulfotransferases, adenosine 3 0 -phosphate 5 0 -phosphate (PAPS) acts as the donor (Hirschberg et al. 1998) . The active sites of all these enzymes are oriented towards the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. This necessitates the translocation of their donors from the cytosol into the lumenal Golgi compartments. In this chapter we will focus on the structure, function and localization of the Golgi nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), and highlight the diseases and developmental defects associated with defective transporters. We direct the reader to several excellent reviews on Golgi transporters for additional details and references (Hirschberg et al. 1998; Berninsone and Hirschberg 2000; Gerardy-Schahn et al. 2001; Handford et al. 2006; .",

            "text": "In early studies, mutants exhibiting altered glycosylation in both mammalian cell lines and other organisms, such as yeast and the protozoan parasite Leishmania, were isolated and found defective in nucleotide sugar transport by biochemical analysis (Ballou et al. 1991; Descoteaux et al. 1995; Patnaik and Stanley 2006) . In these analyses, investigators quantified the transport of radiolabeled sugar nucleotides into sealed vesicles under different conditions using filtration or centrifugation to separate the vesicles from the assay medium (reviewed in Hirschberg et al. 1998) . For example, Deutscher et al. (1984) demonstrated that Lec2 CHO cells possessed only 2% of the CMP-Sia transport activity of wild type CHO cells, while others demonstrated similar decreases in UDP-GlcNAc transport activity in the Kluyveromyces lactis mnn2-2 mutant (Abeijon et al. 1996a) , in UDP-Gal transport activity in the MDCKII-RCA r mutant (Brandli et al. 1988) , and in GDP-Man transport activity in both the L. donovani C3PO mutant and in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vrg4 mutant (Ma et al. 1997; Dean et al. 1997) . These studies demonstrated that nucleotide sugar transport was absolutely required for glycosylation in mammalian, yeast and protozoan cells and provided investigators with a way to clone the defective transporters by complementation. The cloning of NST coding sequences opened the way to further characterization of the structure and function of the transporters by expression in heterologous systems and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. This also allowed investigators to identify inactivating NST mutations leading to developmental defects and human disease.",

Fringe is a GlcNAc transferase that modifies O-linked fucose residues on the Notch receptors epidermal growth factor repeats, and this modification differentially modulates the binding of Notch to receptors and its signaling pathways (Haltiwanger and Lowe 2004) . Accordingly, Fringe connection is a Golgi localized multi-substrate nucleotide sugar transporter that transports UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl (Selva et al. 2001) . Other groups cloned putative human orthologs of Fringe connection (Suda et al. 2004; Ishida et al. 2005) , and over expression of one of these proteins in mammalian cells increased surface levels of heparan sulfate, consistent with the activity of Drosophila Fringe connection (Suda et al. 2004) .",

The nucleotide sugar transport/antiport cycle in the Golgi apparatus. (A) GDP-Man, which is synthesized in the cytoplasm, is transported into the Golgi lumen by the GDP-Man transporter. In the Golgi lumen, GDP-Man is a substrate for mannosyltransferases (triangle), which transfer Man to glycoconjugate substrates (rectangle). GDP, the other product of the transfer reaction, is converted by a lumenal nucleoside diphosphatase (oval) to GMP. The export of GMP to the cytosol is coupled to the import of GDP-Man. (B) This type of antiport mechanism occurs for the exchange of CMP-Sia and CMP using a distinct CMP-Sia transporter. The major difference is that no diphosphatase activity is needed because CMP is released following the sialyltransferase reaction.",

This requires that the nucleoside diphosphates released after transfer of the sugar to the glycoconjugate substrate are converted to nucleoside monophosphates by diphosphatases (Fig. 1A) . Of course, CMP-Sia is the one exception because CMP is directly released following sugar transfer (Fig. 1B) . Additional evidence for the importance of disphosphatase activities in the nucleotide sugar antiporter mechanism came from the finding that deletion of the S. cerevisiae Golgi guanosine diphosphatase (Gda1) decreased GDP-Man transport into membrane vesicles and led to a partial defect in the addition of Man to both glycoproteins and glycolipids (Abeijon et al. 1993; Berninsone et al. 1994) . Other work by DAlessio et al. (2005) demonstrated that GDP-Man dependent glycosylation is reduced but not eliminated in nucleoside diphosphatase mutants in yeast, and suggested that other mechanisms may lead to nucleoside monophosphate translocation. Recent studies by Muraoka et al. (2007) in which the transporter mechanism was evaluated for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized human UGTrel7 transporter, that is capable of transporting UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, and the Golgi localized Drosophila Fringe connection transporter, suggested that the former transporter may be a UDP-sugar/UDP-sugar antiporter, while the latter may use UDP as efficiently as UMP as an antiport substrate.",

Three redundant, multi-substrate specific C. elegans NSTs, SQV7, SRF-3, and CO3H5.2, have been characterized. As described above, the SQV-7 protein is a multi-substrate transporter that is specific for UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-Gal and transports these substrates in a competitive and non-cooperative fashion (Berninsone et al. 2001) . In contrast to the sqv mutants, the C. elegans srf mutants exhibit no obvious behavioral or morphological changes, but do have defects in cell surface molecules that alter their binding to antibodies and lectins and block infection/colonization by parasites (reviewed in Hoflich et al. 2004 ). The srf-3 gene encodes a transporter that is specific for both UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc (Hoflich et al. 2004 ), while the CO3H5.2 gene encodes a transporter specific for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc . Surprisingly, the CO3H5.2 and SRF-3 transporters use a simultaneous and non-competitive substrate transport mechanism that differs from the competitive mechanism used by the SQV7 transporter (Caffaro et al. , 2007 . A deletion of 16 amino acids in the loop between transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 3 of the CO3H5.2 protein preferentially decreased UDP-GalNAc transport by 85-90%, but did not impact UDP-GlcNAc transport, suggesting two independent translocation sites for these nucleotide sugars .",

            "text": "The existence of these three C. elegans transporters that exhibit partially overlapping substrate specificity (UDP-GlcNAc) and expression patterns, led Caffaro et al. (2007) to investigate this redundancy. They used RNAi technology to knock down the CO3H5.2 gene in srf-3 mutants and found that a defect in both transporters led to developmental and morphological changes not observed in the srf-3 mutant alone. This strongly suggested that these two transporters are at least partially redundant and begged the question why redundancy was needed. One possibility, suggested by the investigators, is that certain nucleotide sugars need to be maintained at high levels so that processes requiring these molecules can proceed with high efficiency under a variety of circumstances. In addition, if nucleotide sugar levels drop, different glycosylation pathways can be differentially affected depending upon the affinity of the associated glycosyltransferases for the particular nucleotide sugar. For example, in the MDCKII-RCA r cell mutant where availability of UDP-Gal is limited, a decreased galactosylation is observed for glycoproteins, glycolipids and keratan sulfate proteoglycans, while the amounts of chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans remain relatively normal (Toma et al. 1996) . Similarly, in LADII/CDG IIc patients who have a defect in the GDP-Fuc transporter, low dose oral Fuc supplementation therapy partially restores P-selectin-mediated, but not E-selectin-mediated binding of neutrophils (Marquardt et al. 1999a, b) . Since the synthesis of P-and E-selectin glycan ligands depends upon different Fuc transferase activities (Huang et al. 2000) , it is likely that the enzymes have different affinities for GDP-Fuc and that this leads to differences in glycoconjugate expression under limiting GDP-Fuc levels. Another possible reason that there may be genetic pressure to maintain the expression of rendundant multi-substrate transporters is so that the non-overlapping functions of these transporters can be maintained . A third possibility, is that different transporters with similar specificity function in conjunction with specific glycosylation pathways. This idea is supported by the work of Capul et al. (2007) who cloned two UDP-Gal transporters from L. major (LPG5A and LPG5B) and demonstrated that deficiencies in these transporters impacted the biosynthesis of the two predominant Leishmania surface glycoconjugates differently.",

For example, the rat liver UDP-GalNAc and GDP-Fuc transporters both migrate with molecular masses of approximately 40 kDa upon denaturing gel electrophoresis, but exhibit molecular masses of 80-90 kDa in native glycerol gradients . VRG4, the S. cerevisiae GDP-Man transporter has also been found to be a homodimer (Gao and Dean 2000) . A carboxy-terminal region of this protein, which includes the last TM helix, is necessary for dimer formation, and truncated proteins lacking this sequence are unstable and rapidly degraded. Interestingly, overexpression of an aminoterminal truncated VRG4 protein in yeast causes a dominant negative growth phenotype. This is believed to be a consequence of the formation of inactive heterodimers of the truncated protein and the endogenous full length protein, and supports the notion that homodimerization of VRG4 is crucial for its function. In contrast LPG2, the Leishmania GDP-Man transporter, which migrates as a hexamer in native glycerol gradients and upon pore-limited native gel electrophoresis (Hong et al. 2000) .

(2001) identified a conserved region in the yeast Vrg4 GDP-Man transporter (amino acids 280-291) as the transporters GDP-Man binding site, because mutations in this sequence reduced binding to a photoaffinity substrate analog and led to decreased GDP-Man transport. Gerardy-Schahn and colleagues (Eckhardt et al. 1998; Oelmann et al. 2001) identified the various mutations in the Lec2 and Lec8 complementation groups that lead to defects in the CMP-Sia transporter and UDP-Gal transporter, respectively. While many of the identified mutants of the CMP-Sia transporter were deletions that led to mislocalization and low expression, the Gly189Glu mutant was localized in the Golgi and well-expressed, suggesting that this amino acid was critical for transporter activity per se (Eckhardt et al. 1998) . Likewise, the DSer213 and Gly281Asp mutants of the UDP-Gal transporter were localized properly and expressed well, but still inactive. Interestingly, introducing these changes into the CMP-Sia transporter also led to its inactivation, suggesting that these conserved residues are important for general transporter mechanism . Aoki et al. (2001 Aoki et al. ( , 2003 identified critical TM helices in both the CMP-Sia and UDP-Gal transporters. These transporters are 43% identical and yet are absolutely specific for their respective substrates. The investigators created chimeras containing TM helices from both transporters and found that CMP-Sia transporter TM helix 7 was necessary and sufficient for transport of CMP-Sia when inserted into a UDP-Gal transporter background, while the inclusion of TM helices 2 and 3 enhanced efficiency of transport. In contrast, TM helices 1 and 8 of the UDP-Gal transporter were necessary but not sufficient for UDP-Gal transport in the context of the CMP-Sia transporter. Only the inclusion of either TM helices 9 and 10, or TM helices 2, 3 and 7 from the UDP-Gal transporter, in addition to TM helix 1 and 8, could generate a chimeric transporter competent to transport UDP-Gal (Aoki et al. 2003) .",

The amino-terminal 44 amino acids of VRG4, the yeast Golgi GDP-Man transporter, are likely to include an ER export signal because deletion of this region leads to ER accumulation, and fusion of these sequences to related ER proteins promotes their transport to the Golgi apparatus (Gao and Dean 2000) .

Likewise, several redundant mechanisms including those involving lipid partitioning, oligomerization, and retrieval, may be used to maintain Golgi enzymes in their resident cisternae (Colley 1997; Mironov et al. 2005) . When considering the organization of glycosylation pathways in the Golgi, it is tempting to speculate that NSTs are co-compartmentalized with the glycosyltransferases that use their nucleotide sugar substrates as donors and that they may even form functional complexes. For this reason we were surprised to find that the CMP-Sia transporter showed a more restricted medial-trans Golgi localization than might be indicated by the rather broad Golgi distribution of sialyltransferases involved in both the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Zhao et al. 2006 ). This finding, together with others (DAlessio et al. 2003; Kabu\u00df et al. 2005) , suggests that CMP-Sia as well as other nucleotide sugars move freely in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. This is consistent with recent evidence that the Golgi cisternae are more interconnected than once believed (Mironov et al. 2005) .",

The first TM helix of the avian coronavirus E1 protein is sufficient to localize two cell surface proteins to the Golgi and is likely to play a role in mediating E1 Golgi localization (Machamer and Rose 1987) . Later studies showed that uncharged polar residues that line one face of this TM helix are important for Golgi localization (Swift and Machamer 1991) . Work by Locker et al. (1994) suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of the mouse hepatitis virus M protein plays a role in its Golgi localization. We have recently found that, while the CMP-Sia transporter cytoplasmic sequences have no direct role in Golgi localization, fusing the first TM helix of the transporter to the lumenal sequences of an inefficiently retained Golgi sialyltransferase can reduce the level of its Golgi exit (W. Zhao and K. J. Colley, unpublished data) . This suggests that, like the Golgi localization of the infectious bronchitis virus E1 protein, the first TM helix of the CMP-Sia transporter may be involved in its Golgi localization.",

Complex formation between a transporter and its corresponding glycosyltransferase would presumably enhance the efficiency of the glycosylation reaction by facilitating the transfer of the nucleotide sugar to the glycosyltransferase. Along these lines, Sprong et al. (2003) found that a portion of the Golgi UDP-Gal transporter can associate with the ER localized UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase to allow UDP-Gal import into this compartment. However, evidence for other functional NST-glycosyltransferase complexes is lacking. Radiation inactivation studies suggest that the galactosyl-and sialyltransferases are not in functional complexes with the corresponding transporters (Fleischer et al. 1993) . Moreover, redistribution studies show that there is no complex formation between the CMP-Sia transporter and the corresponding sialyltransferases (Zhao et al. 2006) . Although weak interactions between glycosyltransferases and their respective NSTs are still possible, these results suggest that NSTs may not rely on glycosyltransferases for their Golgi localization.",

However, many questions remain concerning the mechanism of nucleotide sugar transport, the roles and expression of multisubstrate and redundant NSTs, the potential connection of redundant transporters with specific glycosylation pathways, the mechanisms of NST Golgi localization, and how NSTs and glycosyltransferases are organized within the Golgi apparatus. For example, how is the developmental, cellular and tissue expression of redundant and multi-substrate NSTs controlled? Do differences in sub-Golgi localization of NSTs with similar substrate specificity allow these transporters to be compartmentalized with glycosylation enzymes in different pathways? How does the simultaneous transport of two substrates occur in one transporter? What are the precise interactions mediating nucleotide sugar recognition and transport? How are NSTs localized in the Golgi, and how are they organized vis a vis their respective glycosyltransferases to promote efficient glycosylation? The realization that mutant NSTs lead to human disease and developmental defects has and will continue to generate interest in these proteins and will hopefully stimulate additional research to answer these many questions.",
