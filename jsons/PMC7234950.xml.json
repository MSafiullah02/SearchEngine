            "text": "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, dashboards that summarize large amounts of information have become a topic of public interest. In particular, an interactive web-dashboard from Johns Hopkins University has proven useful in monitoring the outbreak of the pandemic and keeping billions of people informed about current developments [1,2]. Such dashboards help to illustrate key figures on a screen full of information [3] and provide visual, functional, and/or interactive analytical features to handle chunks of information effectively [2]. Similarly, these tools can also help ensure that operational decision-makers in organizations are not overwhelmed by the avalanche of data when trying to use information effectively [4]. The challenge for contemporary organizations and related research is, therefore, to make the collected data more valuable to operational decision-makers. Dashboards and their underlying features have become an essential approach to addressing this challenge [4]. Negash and Gray [5] describe dashboards as one of the most effective analysis tools. As the interaction between operational decision-makers and decision support systems (DSS) largely occurs via graphical user interfaces (GUIs) [3], the design and implemented features of a dashboard are of specific importance for the effectiveness of a DSS, particularly at the operational level [4]. Over the years, research has proposed several possible solution types. A first research direction focuses on reporting current operations to inform operational decision-makers [3]. Such dashboards are rather static by nature and do not interact with the user. Static dashboards focus on visual features, which attempt to present information efficiently and effectively to a user [4]. Few [3] reports 13 common mistakes in visual dashboard design (e.g., introducing meaningless variety or encoding quantitative data inaccurately). However, static dashboards appear no longer sufficient to account for the increased need to analyze complex and multidimensional data at the operational level. This issue is a key challenge for the visualizations used in static dashboards, which are often labeled \u201cread-only\u201d [6].",

Functional features refer indirectly to visualization but define what the dashboard is capable of doing [4]. The aim is to create interactive dashboards that involve users during data analysis. Scientific articles in this stream suggest that individuals should drill down, roll up, or filter information, or are automatically alerted to business situations [7]. Such involvement appears to support users' comprehension of the complex nature of the data. However, obtaining this understanding comes at the expense of cognitive effort and time required to process the data manually, which might lead to delayed decisions or errors [8].",

Such dashboards recognize the limits of low human involvement with static dashboards, the high human involvement with interactive dashboards, and value the introduction of interactive analytical features [10]. The idea is to solve optimization problems automatically via computational approaches in the backend (analytical component) but to (still) involve the individual in the optimization process via the GUI (interactive component) [11]. Implementations range from robust trial-and-error to more advanced approaches such as interactive multi-objective optimization [12]. Yigitbasioglu and Velcu [4] and Pauwels et al. [9] argue that the promise of interactive analytical features such as a what-if analysis is unrealized in current dashboard solutions for operational DSS. A what-if analysis is a trial-and-error method that manipulates a dashboard's underlying optimization model to approximate a real-world problem [13]. However, by introducing an interactive analytical feature, operational decision-makers can interact with the optimization system without knowing the optimization model or understanding how the optimization procedure behind the results operates [14]. Such behavior can harm an individual's comprehension of the current situation, nourishing an out-of-the-loop problem\u2014a situation in which a human being lacks sufficient knowledge of particular issues [15]. The fear is \u201cthat manual skills will deteriorate with lack of use\u201d and individuals will no longer be able to work manually when needed ([15], p. 381).",

            "text": "Although what-if analyses have been investigated for DSS, empirical results have shown conflicting results. In particular, opposing patterns for the relationship toward decision performance have been reported in different studies. Benbasat and Dexter [16], as well as Sharda et al. [17], found a positive relationship. However, Fripp [18] and Goslar et al. [19] have demonstrated no statistically significant effect. In turn, others like Davis et al. [13] found that decision-makers performed better without a what-if analysis. With these conflicting results, it is surprising that academic literature gives relatively little attention to (1) how interactive analytical dashboard features should appear or (2) how they influence human beings' cognitive abilities in operational DSS [4]. An adequate level of situation awareness (SA) is emphasized as a promising starting point to examine this unfolding research gap [20]. Human factors research confirms that human beings' SA represents a key enabler for operational decision-making and task performance [21,22]. The importance of SA raises the question of how dashboard features can be designed to influence SA positively [23,24]. The objective of this study is, therefore, to examine the relationship between an interactive analytical dashboard feature, human beings' SA, and task performance in operational DSS. We implement a what-if analysis to study this relationship. Prominent references acknowledge that present dashboards \u201cjust perform status reporting, and development of [a] what-if capability would strongly enhance their value\u201d ([9], p. 9). We rely on Endsley's [25] SA model as a theoretical guide for our analysis. It is established in academia and has shown favorable outcomes in different studies [21]. We formulate the following research question: How does a what-if analysis feature in an interactive analytical dashboard influence operational decision-makers' situation awareness and task performance in operational DSS?\n",

First, the amount of APS data sets up severe challenges concerning the display resolution in dashboards [26]. Second, until now, few publications addressed dashboards and their influence in APS and production planning in general. For instance, Wu and Acharya [27] outlined a basic GUI design in the context of metal ingot casting. In addition, another study by Zhang [28] visualized large amounts of managerial data for evaluating its feasibility. There is a need to understand how planners effectively use dashboards because planning is not a static, one-time activity but rather requires continuous adaption of vast data amounts. Third, this challenge is even more daunting because planners must increasingly make business-critical decisions in less time [26].",

This operationalization is based on the assumption that a high fixation level engages the participant in information-relevant thinking.

            "text": "In any dashboard type, different visual features are used to present data in a graphical form to reduce the time spent on understanding and perceiving them. Visual features relate to the efficiency and effectiveness of information presentation to users [4]. A good balance between information utility and visual complexity is therefore needed. Visual complexity refers to the level of difficulty in offering a verbal description of an image [45]. Studies show that varying surface styles and increasing numbers and ranges of objects increase visual complexity, whereas repetitive and uniform patterns decrease it [46]. Usually, dashboards leverage colors to differentiate objects from one another. The colors red and yellow, which are more likely to attract attention, are examples for signaling distinction [25]. Using such properties too often or inappropriately may lead to confusion or errors because the user would no longer be able to identify the critical information. Similarly, superfluous information within charts, so-called \u201cchart junk\u201d such as overwhelming 3D objects or non-value-adding frames, can appear impressive but severely distract users and induce undesired \u201cvisual clutter\u201d. According to Tufte [47], a high data-ink ratio can reduce this problem. Data-ink ratio is a parameter that defines the relationship of ink used to illustrate data to the overall ink leveraged to represent the chart. A potential strategy refers to the erasing method by eliminating all components in charts with non-data ink. Some chart types promote visual illusions, which can potentially bias decision-making. Gridlines within charts are suggested as a useful technique to overcome such pitfalls [48]. A detailed discussion on visual features can be found in Few [3] and Tufte [47].",

Traditional approaches to point and click interaction refer to merely clicking the mouse on the favored part of a list or chart to receive detailed information. Cleveland [49] initiates brushing, an approach that illustrates details of the data, by placing a mouse pointer over the data display. Such details might show information ranging in size from single values to information from related data points. Filtering is another valuable functional feature. It enables users to not only sort for relevant information but also identify hidden data relationships [7]. Alerts and notifications also describe functional features [7]. They can recommend corrective actions or make the user aware of issues as soon as measures no longer meet critical thresholds. Common influencing variables address type (e.g., warning or announcement), modality (e.g., visual, audio, or haptic), rate of frequency (i.e., how often to alert the user), and timing (i.e., when to induce the alert).",

Such features (still) involve the operational decision-maker in the optimization process via the GUI (interactive component). Computational approaches and software tools solve the optimization problem in the backend (analytical component). Any optimization system contains an optimization model and optimization procedures to solve an optimization problem automatically. An optimization model describes an approximation of a real-world problem. Usually, it includes the definition of the objectives, decision variables, and constraints of the optimization problem. The problem data define the values of the parameter of the optimization model when the optimization problem is triggered. In turn, the optimization procedure solves the problem instances directly linked to the optimization problem by issuing either candidate solutions or intermediate results. An intermediate result is not necessarily a solution and refers to information obtained during this optimization process. Candidate solutions are final solutions to an optimization problem [11]. Interactive optimization systems involve the user at some point in time, allowing him or her to modify the outcomes of the optimization system significantly. These systems leverage user feedback from the presented candidate solutions and intermediate results to adjust either the optimization model or the optimization procedures via a preference model. The preference model contains the preference information obtained from the user feedback [12]. Common examples of a preference model represent weight values in an objective function or heuristic information for the optimization procedure.",

Trial-and-error features are used for both modifying the optimization model and optimization procedures.

The value resides in their capability to illustrate progressive performance improvements via fitting visual features to users. Depending upon the purpose and context, data updates can occur once a month, week, day, or even in real-time [3]. Static dashboards can fulfill both the urgency of fast-paced environments, offering real-time data support, and tracking of performance metrics against enterprise-wide strategic objectives based on historical data. However, such dashboards do not involve the user in the data visualization process and have issues with handling complex and multidimensional data [6]. Interactive dashboards can be considered a step toward directly involving the user in the analysis process. Interactive dashboards consider not only visual features, but also introduce functional features such as point and click interactivity [4]. These capabilities allow operational decision-makers to enable more elaborate analyses [6]. Addressing the impediments of static dashboards, they are used to establish a better understanding of the complex nature of data, which can also foster decision-making. However, the benefits of interactivity could increase the users' cognitive effort and required manual analysis time, increasing the probability of delayed decisions or (even) errors [8].",

Interactive dashboards can represent a less effective means to promote task performance. The underlying reasoning is that manual analysis activities (as offered by interactive dashboards) are cognitively demanding and require time. Operational decision-makers must consider information critically and question its relevance before generating a carefully informed (although not necessarily unbiased) judgment [56]. However, due to the limits of the human mind with storing, assembling, or organizing units of information, operational decision-makers might not be able to transfer an (even) increased level of SA into their planning activities and thus might experience lower task performance [54]. Common obstacles arise from restricted space or natural dissolution of information over time in human beings' working memory. Given abstract information, such dissolution can occur (even) in seconds. Conversely, with interactive analytical dashboards, the cognitive effort and time required are lower because planners can rely on interactive analytical features. For example, a what-if analysis can help to identify defective components rather than scrutinizing all of the information presented on its own [56]. Hence, we expect the following.H2: An interactive analytical dashboard design leads to higher task performance than an interactive dashboard design without analytical features.\n",

Effective decisions require a good state of knowledge in terms of perception, understanding, and projection of the situation at hand [24]. Individuals experience more successful performance outcomes when they obtain a complete overview and knowledge of the current situation [54]. When issues emerge, they typically do so because some considerations of this overview are incomplete or incorrect [24]. The underlying reasoning is that a better SA can increase the control and handling of the system by the individual and thus contribute to task performance. Studies confirmed this relationship in different domains (e.g., automotive, military, or aviation). A decrease of SA is often correlated with reduced task performance, representing the most critical cause of aviation disasters in a review of over 200 incidents [57].

Their ages ranged from 20 to 34 years, with an average age of 24.1 years. We used students as a proxy for dashboard users in APS. We relied on students because similar laboratory experiments have shown that students are an appropriate population not normally biased by real-world experiences [60]. Second, the costs (e.g., financial compensation, physically presence at the campus) to incentivize students to take part in the experiment are relatively low. In turn, one of the main limitations of relying on professionals in experiments is that it is problematic to incentivize them [59]. Third, APS represents a challenging, complex, and cognitive-demanding task. IS students have learned the abilities or knowledge to apply it in complex contexts. Hence, these students seem to fulfill the necessary prerequisite for conducting the experimental task. In this line, we concur with the review by Katok [59] that students can perform as good as professionals do. Bolton et al. [61] confirmed this conclusion in a carefully executed experiment. Fourth, to account for the lack of system experience, we applied different techniques to prepare participants for using the dashboard (e.g., personal support, training tasks, small groups, help button). Because both dashboards participants committed 2.5 errors on average, it appears that they had no difficulties in using them. Lastly, we discussed our study with two production planners and followed their experienced advice regarding several aspects, that is, how to assess the degree of SA and performance or how to design both dashboard types and determine appropriate areas of interest (AoI).",

Different components (e.g., bicycle handlebar, bell, lamp, reflectors, tire, chair) were available for each bicycle. Hereby, the amount of available components or which component was required for which bicycle could differ. Per planning week, only a limited amount of components was available. In addition, for each product, the minimal amount of planned customer demands of all planning weeks was offered. Customer demands represented the basis for the calculation of needed components per planning week. In total, four planning weeks had to be planned by the participants so that all constraints were met and the total revenue was maximized. Three parameters were critical to generate an effective production plan: (i) the number of available components, (ii) the number of products to be produced (demand), and (iii) information about which component is linked to which product. Both designs shared the same APS process and objective to create an optimal production plan solving a planning problem within the given constraints. Both plans comprised initial states and planning restrictions. The initial state was characterized by a set of raw data that did not comply with the planning restrictions. For each plan, all decision packages shared the same complexity. The initial raw data for both plans only differed in their conditions, such as component numbers or weekly demand. We introduced constraints to ensure that users could execute the tasks within an appropriate amount of time: component shortage represented the only restriction for planning, whereas human and machine resources were assumed unrestricted. The participants were required to create a production plan by modifying the changeable raw data with (w/) and without (w/o) a what-if analysis.",

First, our analyses indicated that the interactive analytical dashboard showed significantly higher task performance. This result confirms the value of interactive analytical dashboards and encourages the trend toward introducing interactive analytical features for operational decision-making. We showed that a what-if analysis has the potential to direct participants to the most critical pieces of information such as bottleneck components that require immediate attention. Obstacles to the what-if analysis included a lack of knowledge of operational decision-makers of the current planning situation, which, in turn, resulted in a lower degree of SA (compared with the interactive design). However, our results indicated that if the underlying optimization model and optimization procedure can account for the planning situation (as in our experiment), high-performance outcomes can be possible even in the absence of high participant SA levels. When a planner searches for optimization potential by identifying bottleneck components within production data, the optimization system leads the participant to certain areas of interest. Such focusing, by definition, removes awareness of the ongoing production context, decreasing the overall SA. In conclusion, these cases appear beneficial for task performance as long as the employed optimization model and optimization procedures behind the what-if analysis are capable of addressing the occurring situation.",

Participants who used the interactive dashboard maintained a significantly higher SA when creating a production plan, whereas the interactive analytical design led to a lower degree of SA. Hence, participants who used the interactive analytical variant appeared to follow the system support (through the results proposed by the what-if analysis). Subsequently, they reduced their effort and SA to scrutinize all object-relevant information. These findings illustrate the danger for operational decision-makers of trusting the system results implicitly or (even) of \u201covertrust\u201d, leading to potentially adverse effects such as an out-of-the-loop problem [53]. With increasing simulation abilities, operational decision-makers can become less aware and slower acting in recognizing problems on their own. Thus, if problems require manual intervention, further time is necessary to comprehend \u201cwhat is going on\u201d, which sets boundaries on a quick problem resolution. Following this argumentation, eye-tracking studies [64] confirmed that continuous use of simulation reduces individuals' cognitive skill set because such skills rapidly deteriorate in the absence of practice. These effects can lead to an increasing tool dependence and problems when the underlying optimization model or procedures are not implemented, trained, or tested for the current situation [11].",

Comparable with most other ergonomic constructs (e.g., mental workload and human error), a plethora of methods for measurement exists [22]. However, studies have not agreed upon which of the techniques available represents the most appropriate for assessing SA [65]. This study compared two different measures to assess participants' SA: (i) the established freeze-probe approach (leveraging SAGAT) and (ii) the rather scarcely addressed assessment of SA via eye-tracking [22]. The results indicated that there was a significant correlation between the constructs employed for both methods (i.e., eye-tracking and SAGAT scores). This finding suggests that those approaches were measuring similar aspects of participants' SA during task execution. More interestingly, the analyses showed that only the participants' SAGAT scores derived via the freeze-probe method generated significant correlations with task performance for both dashboard designs. Our eye-tracking data only confirmed the relationship of fixation duration (count) toward errors committed for the interactive analytical dashboard. Hence, the freeze-probe technique seems to represent a stronger predictor of task performance compared with the eye-tracking assessment of SA. This suggests that the rating type in use appears to be a determinant of the respective measure's predictability. In closing, our analyses supported the usage of the freeze-probe technique to assess SA during planning tasks. The findings can be contrasted with previous research that confirmed that SAGAT is one of the most appropriate methods to use when the experimenter knows what SA should comprise beforehand [22].",

This design trend accounts for the challenges decision-makers are facing at the operational level.

In such situations, operational decision-makers experience increasingly high mental workload in their attempt to process data with their own working memory [8] \u2013 a rather limited, laggard, and error-prone resource [66].

Research reports that the effect on SA was improved to a substantial degree by the transparency of the optimization system, thus offering understandability of its actions [54]. Such transparency can help individuals to understand the cause of actions and reduce the downside effects of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.",

In other fields, individuals are required to periodically perform in a manual mode to maintain their skills and appropriate SA levels [68]. The measurement of SA is thus key not only to improve SA-related theory but also to advance the design of training and evaluation efforts for practitioners. Hence, scholars demand valid and reliable methods to verify and enhance SA theory. System designers require a means to ensure that SA is increased by new features, GUIs, or training programs [54].",

Our study objective was to examine the effects of an interactive analytical dashboard feature, a what-if analysis. To date, little is understood about its influence on human cognitive abilities. We argued that designing such a dashboard feature requires a profound understanding of SA because a lack of awareness is known to interfere with human information processing. Further, it entails downstream effects on the human ability to make informed decisions. We created a model that relates a what-if analysis to support SA that, in turn, would positively affect task performance. We conducted one large-scale laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking and SAGAT data, to study this model from a holistic viewpoint.",

Our results indicate that interactive analytical features induce significant effects on task performance. We showed that the introduction of a what-if analysis could reduce the role of required SA for the operational decision-maker. However, such cases appear only beneficial for task performance as long as the underlying optimization model and optimization procedures behind the dashboard address the occurring situation. We also reported that the implementation of a what-if analysis is not cost-free and can trigger adverse effects such as a loss of SA. This finding confirms the notion of the out-of-the-loop syndrome applying in the APS context and extends it to the dashboard feature level. In addition, our correlation analyses indicated the expected link of SA to task performance. Although multiple studies have shown the relevance of SA for decision-making, we illustrated that low task performance could result from good SA and vice versa. Thus, we believe that other influencing variables could be involved in converting SA into successful performance that require further assessment. However, how SA is assessed is also fundamental because correlations within both dashboard alternatives differed according to the measurements concerning the link of SA to task performance. The SAGAT scores confirmed this relationship for both alternatives, whereas the eye-tracking data showed significant correlations only for the interactive analytical design. We, therefore, provided evidence that using SAGAT seems most appropriate.",

We studied the effects of a what-if analysis, which we expected to play a key role in the creation and reduction of SA. Future work might consider further interactive analytical features, such as interactive multi-objective optimization [12]. Other approaches involve the user at different points in time (i.e., user feedback on candidate solutions vs. on intermediate results), leverage the feedback loops with the user for different parts of the preference model (i.e., adjustments of the optimization model vs. optimization procedures), and occasionally include preference learning. It might be interesting to compare individuals' SA and task performance scores obtained with those features.",
