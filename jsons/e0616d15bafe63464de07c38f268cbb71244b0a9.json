Critically important are natural holes excavated by woodpeckers (Picidae), and they are preferred by hole-nesting mammals and birds (Czeszczewik et al. 2008 , Cockle et al. 2011 . Moreover, even where holes occur, not all are of sufficient quality to be inhabited by mammals and birds (Czeszczewik et al. 2008) , and hence organisms compete for the best holes (Flux & Flux 1992 , Juskaitis 2006 , Remm et al. 2006 . Important factors include security, availability and access to foraging places, for example to open habitats (Mazgajski 2000 , Smith 2006 , Czeszczewik et al. 2008 .",

Although natural holes made by birds and nest-boxes are both occupied by bats (e.g. Berthinussen et al. 2014) , to date the simultaneous occurrence of bats and birds has not been reported. However, we suggest that this is a frequent occurrence with potentially profound implications.

This raises the question of why Noctules would choose holes already used by Starlings. A likely explanation is the thermal benefit, because holes occupied by Starlings are likely to be warmer, because incubation and then growing chicks transfer heat to the cavity (Biebach 1986 , Ward et al. 1999 . Additionally a study in forests in eastern Poland showed that maternity roosts chosen by Noctules during late pregnancy and lactation were warmer than unoccupied cavities (Ruczynski 2006 , Ruczy nski & Bogdanowicz 2008 . We cannot also exclude the possibility that social information is obtained by bats from the presence of Starlings in the same natural holes. Occupying holes with successful Starlings could provide Noctules with information on the lack of predation during the breeding season, and hence the safety of the nest-hole (Sepp\u20ac anen et al. 2007) .",

Currently almost all European forests are managed as intensive forestry, which significantly reduces the availability of natural holes (Newton 1994 , Remm et al. 2006 . Therefore, we can expect an increase in the phenomenon of coexistence of these two species. However, in the forest stands where we conducted our research, alternative nest-holes were available. Our data show that more than half of the holes in the vicinity of where bats and Starlings coexisted were unoccupied.",

However, these coexistences could have wider consequences. Coexistence could increase the transmission of parasites and diseases between species. Bird and bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and influenza viruses (Tong et al. 2012 , Chan et al. 2013 . Therefore, coexistence could permit the mixing of different bird and mammal viruses for the generation of novel mutant, recombinant or reassortment of RNA viruses. Such a situation seems more likely given that both species are known to be hosts of influenza viruses -Noctules with H3N2 (L'Vov et al. 1979) and Starlings with H5N1 (Boon et al. 2007) . Bats can also carry many other diseases (Petney et al. 2010 , Smith & Wang 2013 , Hall et al. 2016 ).",
