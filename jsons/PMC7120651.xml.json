            "text": "Upon host infection, viruses hijack multiple cellular functions in order to promote their replication and favor viral particle progeny. To ensure this, some viruses evolved the ability to integrate their genome into the host chromosomes, yielding to various consequences for the host cell, including gene disruption, oncogenesis or premature cell death, and may ultimately contribute to species evolution through inheritable genome inclusions. Although viral genome integration into the host genome is an obligatory step for viruses such as retroviruses, it may also occur incidentally for some other viruses (Table 1). This review will summarize the current knowledge on viruses integrating into the host genome and the consequences for the host cell.\n",

            "text": "After completion of reverse transcription, the linear double-stranded cDNA flanked by the long terminal repeats (LTR) is part of a nucleoprotein complex called preintegration complex (PIC). The PIC contains multiple viral and cellular proteins \u2013 including in the case of HIV-1: viral integrase (IN), matrix (MA), Vpr, and cellular barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), high-mobility group chromosomal protein A1 (HMGA1), integrase interactor 1 (Ini1), lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) \u2013 that may contribute to nuclear translocation, integration of the viral genome, and subsequent immediate transcription, and which composition may vary along the way to the host genome (Belshan et al. 2009; Farnet and Haseltine 1991; Fassati and Goff 2001; Lin and Engelman 2003; Miller et al. 1997; Raghavendra et al. 2010). To cross the nuclear membrane and reach the nucleus, retroviruses have evolved different strategies. Simple retroviruses (alpharetroviruses, betaretroviruses, gammaretroviruses and epsilonretroviruses) are able to reach the nucleus only upon nuclear membrane disruption occurring at the time of mitosis, providing a coherent explanation on why these retroviruses infect dividing cells but are unable to infect non-dividing cells (Lewis and Emerman 1994; Roe et al. 1993). In contrast, spumaviruses and lentiviruses have the capacity to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, entering the nucleus through an active, yet poorly elucidated, mechanism (Suzuki and Craigie 2007). The current model for HIV-1 proposes that a PIC containing minimally the viral integrase and the viral cDNA crosses the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a superstructure mediating the transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, via specific interactions with NPC proteins, including importin \u03b13, importin 7, NUP153*, RANBP2* and Transportin-SR2/TNPO3 (Ao et al. 2010; Christ et al. 2008; Levin et al. 2010; Ocwieja et al. 2011; Woodward et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Retroviral genome integration occurs in three steps, the first two being catalyzed by the retroviral integrase (IN) protein (Fig. 1b, the example of HIV-1) (Li et al. 2011). IN is bound to the LTR and requires approximately the 32 terminal nucleotides (Bera et al. 2009). First, when the PIC is still in the cytoplasm (Miller et al. 1997), IN hydrolyzes a dinucleotide at each 3\u2032 end, a process called 3\u2032 processing. Second, IN catalyzes the strand transfer reaction, consisting in simultaneously breaking the host DNA asymmetrically and joining it to the recessed viral DNA 3\u2032-OH ends. The IN-mediated asymmetric DNA breaks in the host genome are determined by the retroviral protein structure and vary between 4 and 6 nucleotides (5 in the case of HIV-1). Finally, to stabilize the proviral insertion, the host DNA repair machinery \u2013 involving the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) comprising a DNA-PK catalytic subunit and a DNA binding Ku80/Ku70 complex, and the ligase IV/XRRC4 complex of the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) \u2013 cleaves the viral protruding 5\u2032 nucleotides and fills in the 4\u20136 bp gap, resulting in the duplication of the gap nucleotide sequence surrounding the provirus.",

It contains between 280 and 450 amino acids depending on the retrovirus (for example, HIV-1 IN: 288 amino acids), that are divided in three protein domains (Li et al. 2011). The N-terminal domain (residues 1\u201350 in HIV-1 IN), containing an HHCC zinc-binding motif, is involved mostly in viral DNA binding, and IN multimerization. The C-terminal domain (residues 212\u2013288 in HIV-1 IN) is also involved in DNA binding and IN multimerization. And most importantly, the catalytic core domain (residues 50\u2013212 in HIV-1 IN), carrying a typical signature with the D,D(35)E acidic triad in the active site, is essential for metal (Mg2+) binding and IN enzymatic activity, and is involved in viral DNA binding as well as host cellular target DNA binding.

Initial experiments showed that IN was able to catalyze half site integration (one LTR end integrated in the acceptor DNA) using 21-mer oligonucleotides mimicking the U3 or U5 ends of the LTR. However, the use of longer DNA substrates mixed with IN allowed to reconstitute concerted full-site integration (integration of both LTR ends) (Sinha and Grandgenett 2005; Sinha et al. 2002), thereby mimicking the in vivo situation more faithfully and suggesting that other genomic regions in addition to LTR extremities contribute to integration efficiency (Li and Craigie 2005). Although IN is sufficient to perform the first two steps of integration in vitro, multiple PIC components, including LEDGF/p75, were shown to improve the efficiency of this process, both in vitro and in vivo (Van Maele et al. 2006).",

Indeed gammaretroviruses, spumaretroviruses and endogenous retroviruses favor promoters and transcription start sites of active genes, characterized by high CpG islands and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (Mitchell et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2003; Trobridge et al. 2006; Brady et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2008, 2011). Integration of alpharetroviruses and deltaretrovirues is also, although weakly, favored in transcription units and CpG islands (Derse et al. 2007; Mitchell et al. 2004). In contrast, lentiviruses prefer integrating in active genes, along the transcription unit, in both introns and exons, and are often associated with epigenetic marks characterizing active transcription, including H3Ac, H4Ac, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, while disfavoring epigenetic marks associated with repressed transcription such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K79me3, H4K20me3 and DNA methylation (Brady et al. 2011; Derse et al. 2007; Mitchell et al. 2004; Roth et al. 2011; Schroder et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007, 2009). Finally, the MMTV betaretrovirus is the only one considered to integrate randomly, with no statistically significant preference for chromosomal features (Faschinger et al. 2008), nevertheless some common integration sites near cellular oncogenes belonging to Wnt and Fgf families have been reported (Callahan and Smith 2000, 2008).",

Although all these models may contribute to integration site selection, only evidence for the tethering model has been identified so far (Fig. 2b). This model suggests that integration site selection is dictated by a protein, directly or indirectly complexed with the retroviral-specific IN, and acting as a tethering protein between the PIC and the host chromatin, thereby promoting integration at a nearby DNA site (Bushman et al. 2005; Ciuffi and Bushman 2006; Desfarges and Ciuffi 2010). Therefore, any PIC component could potentially act as a tethering protein.",

Swaps between HIV-1 and MLV at the level of Gag and IN highlighted the role of these two viral proteins as major determinants for integration targeting. Indeed, HIV-1 vector containing MLV Gag only displayed specific integration preferences that differed from both HIV-1 and MLV and suggesting that Gag may play a role in integration site selection. In contrast, HIV-1 vector containing MLV IN lost integration preferences for transcription units and acquired preferences for transcription start sites close to MLV phenotype, suggesting that HIV-1 IN is the major determinant for HIV-1 integration site selection. However, an HIV-1 vector containing both MLV Gag and MLV IN preferentially integrated into transcription start sites, completely recapitulating MLV integration site distribution, thereby suggesting that in the case of MLV, both Gag and IN are likely to be major viral determinants of integration site selection.",

Indeed, cells depleted for LEDGF/p75 do not favor transcription units anymore but rather CpG islands (Ciuffi et al. 2005; Marshall et al. 2007; Schrijvers et al. 2012; Shun et al. 2007). LEDGF/p75 is required for efficient integration and site selection, not only for HIV-1, but for many lentiviruses (SIV, EIAV) (Busschots et al. 2007; Cherepanov 2007; Marshall et al. 2007). In contrast, integration site selection of other retroviruses, such as MLV (a gammaretrovirus), is not affected by LEDGF/p75 depletion, providing additional evidence that LEDGF/p75 is the major tethering factor for lentiviruses only. Of note, Schrijvers et al. recently demonstrated that, in absence of LEDGF/p75, hepatoma-derived growth factor related protein 2 (HRP2) was acting as an alternative tethering protein for HIV-1 PIC, although less efficient than LEDGF/p75 (Schrijvers et al. 2012). Except for Foamy virus (FV), for which H2A/H2B heterodimers were shown to interact with FV Gag, thus tethering FV PIC to chromatin (Tobaly-Tapiero et al. 2008), specific tethering proteins for other retroviral genera remains to be identified.",

Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses containing a bisegmented negative single stranded RNA genome coding for four viral proteins: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the nucleocapsid, the glycoprotein and a RING-domain containing protein. The replication of arenaviruses is completely different from retroviruses, with a broader cell tropism (Emonet et al. 2011). Viral replication takes place exclusively in the cytoplasm in which RNA synthesis is performed by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Although RdRps belong to the reverse transcriptase-like superfamily, no reverse transcriptase activity has been detected so far. Therefore, these viruses normally do not integrate into the host chromosomes. However, studies aiming at characterizing LCMV persistence in infected mice were able to detect LCMV DNA sequences by PCR in \u223c60% of mice 200 days post-infection (long after LCMV blood clearance), at a frequency of about 1 LCMV DNA copy in 104\u2013105 splenocytes (Klenerman et al. 1997). LCMV DNA was also detected in murine and hamster cell lines (which are considered as the natural hosts for LCMV), but not in non-natural host cell lines (human, monkey, dog, cow). Further analysis highlighted a role for retrotransposons*, encoding a reverse transcriptase (RT), in the generation of LCMV DNA and subsequent integration. Interestingly, murine and hamster cells display a high level of endogenous RT activity, consistent, in part, with the natural host restriction observed. Recently, Geuking et al. showed that RT from endogenous retrotransposons can illegitimately recombine with the exogenous LCMV RNA genome by template switching, providing additional data pointing towards the role of retrotransposons in reverse transcribing and integrating LCMV genomic sequences (Geuking et al. 2009).",

Similarly to arenaviruses, neither reverse transcriptase activity, nor integration activity have been reported for these viruses. However, sequences of the capsid and the RdRp genes have been identified in many eukaryotic genomes, suggesting that integration of these viral sequences can occur more frequently as initially expected (Liu et al. 2010). Based on these observations, the question remains: how can these viral sequences integrate in the host genome? Liu and coworkers proposed two models (Liu et al. 2010): (i) an illegitimate and incidental recombination with retrotransposons may occur, leading to the integration of viral sequences, as described for LCMV (Geuking et al. 2009; Tanne and Sela 2005) or (ii) the double-strand-break repair machinery of the host cell may capture nearby viral DNA sequences and insert them in some instable regions of the genome, as described in yeast (Frank and Wolfe 2009; Puchta 2005). Although both models can each contribute, only the first model enacting a role for retrotransposons can explain the prior appearance of a viral DNA intermediate, essential for being considered as a substrate of host genome insertion.",

            "text": "The adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a widespread virus classified among the parvoviridae family. The relationship between AAV and the host remains obscure due partially to the absence of associated pathology. Replication of AAV is strictly conditioned by the presence in the same infected cell of helper viruses such as adenoviruses (Ad), human papillomaviruses (HPV) or herpes simplex viruses (HSV). In absence of helper viruses, AAV integrates its genome in a site-specific way. The molecular mechanism involved in AAV integration has only been investigated for the type 2 serotype (AAV-2). The genome organization of AAV-2 consists of two major open reading frames coding for the non-structural proteins Rep (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40) and structural proteins Cap (VP1, VP2 and VP3), flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR). The site-specific integration of AAV-2 is located in a non-repetitive element at the position 19q13,42 corresponding to the long arm of the chromosome 19, in a gene-dense region named AAVS1 (for AAV integration site 1) (Fig. 3a) (Kotin et al. 1991). Analysis of AAVS1 host sequence revealed two cis-acting sequences involved in AAV-2 integration: the terminal resolution site (TRS) corresponding to the Rep-specific endonuclease site and the Rep binding site (RBS) (Brister and Muzyczka 1999; McCarty et al. 1994a, b). Interestingly, this TRS-RBS motif is also present in the ITR of the viral genome, suggesting that the sequence homo\u00adlogy between AAV-2 ITR and the host genome site \u2013 TRS and RBS sequences \u2013 plays a role in AAV-2 integration. Recently, two new AAV-2 integration sites have been reported in chromosomes 5 (5p13.3) and 3 (3p24.3), named AAVS2 and AAVS3 respectively, that also carry a RBS motif (H\u00fcser et al. 2010).\n",

More particularly, AAV-2 integration starts with Rep68/Rep78 complex introducing a nick at the adjacent cellular TRS that may induce the non homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) repair machinery. Non homologous recombination between the viral ITRs and the host DNA results in the viral insertion of AAV-2 in the host genome and the partial duplication of the integration site (Henckaerts and Linden 2010; Lamartina et al. 2000; Urcelay et al. 1995).",

            "text": "EBV is the prototypical member of the \u03b3-herpesvirus family and is known to establish a long persistent infection in B-lymphocytes as well as in epithelial cells. EBV is associated with several proliferative disorders and cancers, including Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Epstein et al. 1964; Gutensohn and Cole 1980; Zur Hausen and Schulte-Holthausen 1970). Two stages of EBV infection exist: (i) the lytic or productive cycle, in which the infected cell is actively releasing new infectious viral particles, and (ii) the latent cycle, in which only a few viral proteins are expressed, some of which are directly linked with cell proliferation and thus cancer. During latent infection, the EBV genome persists as an episome. However, the presence of linearized EBV genome in the host genome has been identified and confirmed using different approaches, including cytological hybridization, FISH*, PCR*, genomic library screening and sequencing. The presence of integrated EBV genome suggests an alternative way for EBV to establish long term infection (Gao et al. 2006; Hurley et al. 1991; Lestou et al. 1993). However, the question whether integration site selection occurs randomly or not is still a matter of debate, mainly due to the technical difficulties to isolate EBV integration events from EBV episomes (Gao et al. 2006; Takakuwa et al. 2004). Nevertheless, data so far suggest that EBV integration is not random and occurs preferentially in regions corresponding to heterochromatin (Gao et al. 2006; Lestou et al. 1993) (Fig. 3a). However, EBV integration has also been identified in genes, including MACF1*, BACH-2* (putative tumor suppressor gene), REL* and BCL-11A* (proto-oncogenes), thereby revealing a potential impact of EBV integration in disrupting the expression of some cellular genes (Takakuwa et al. 2004).",

The interaction of EBNA-1 with the cellular EBNA-1 Binding Protein 2 (EBP2) and high-mobility group protein 2 (HMGB2) may also play a role in attaching the EBV episome to the host chromatin during interphase and mitosis (Jourdan et al. 2012). This chromatin attachment process could be enlarged to other family members, including the Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV). Indeed, it was shown that KSHV episomal genome was attached to the host chromatin via the cellular histones 2A and 2B, the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and the LANA (latency associated nuclear antigen) viral protein (Fig. 3b) (Barbera et al. 2006; Matsumura et al. 2010; Verma and Robertson 2003). Although the mechanisms involved in EBV and KHSV genome integration into the host chromatin remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to hypothesize, based on the retroviral tethering model, that viral DNA episome integration requires initially these docking proteins (EBNA-1 complex, LANA complex), thereby creating an opportunity for the subsequent incidental recombination and insertion into the host DNA, probably mediated by the cellular DNA repair machinery.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are double stranded DNA viruses, usually perceived as non-integrating viruses with a genome persisting under episomal form. However, in hamster cells, the complete genome of Ad12 was found to be stably integrated into the host chromosomes, with a few nucleotide modifications at the viral junctions. Similarly, Stephen et al. infected hamster immortalized (HT-1080 and C32) and primary fibroblasts (FF-92) with an Ad5-derived vector and identified 59 integration sites: 29 were found in active transcription units in all chromosomes and 15 out of the 30 integration sites identified outside genes were located near genes, suggesting preferential integration of Ad in gene loci (Fig. 3a) (Stephen et al. 2008, 2010). The current model suggests that Ad ITR contains specific symmetric recombinant (SYREC) sequences, which have stretches homologous to cellular repetitive elements, and that could thus allow Ad host genome insertion through patchy nucleotide homology (Fig. 3b) (Deuring and Doerfler 1983; Deuring et al. 1981; Doerfler 2009; Stabel and Doerfler 1982; Wronka et al. 2002). Further analysis of Ad integration events in vitro and in vivo revealed that both homologous recombination and heterologous recombination (non homologous end joining pathway) were involved in this SYREC-mediated integration process (Hoglund et al. 1992; Stephen et al. 2008, 2010; Wronka et al. 2002). Adenovirus-based vectors are currently the most used vectors in gene therapy, representing 24.2% of the clinical trials (source http://www.wiley.com//legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical). Understanding the frequency and the mechanisms of Ad integration and recombination should help render these vectors safer for gene therapy trials.",

            "text": "Apopotosis is a general mechanism involved in cell homeostasis regulation eliminating aberrant cells, with altered physiological parameters as well as a compromised genome integrity (Roulston et al. 1999). Upon viral invasion, the presence of a linear double-stranded DNA is sensed by the host DNA repair machinery as a DNA break, which will lead to cell apoptosis unless successfully repaired (Daniel et al. 1999; O\u2019Brien 1998). Following the same concept, if the cell is invaded by multiple viral particles, thus multiple DNA genomes, it is likely that the DNA repair machinery will be overwhelmed, and will thus fail in repairing all the DNA molecules, thereby resulting in cell death. Similarly, if too many viral genomes integrate successfully, the integrity of the host genome itself may be compromised, also leading to cell death. In addition, viral integration will eventually lead to gene expression deregulation that may induce cell apoptosis. For instance, it has been reported that integration of HBV in ATP2A1/SERCA-1* gene resulted in gene disruption and in the expression of a chimeric non functional protein HBVx/SERCA-1 (Fig. 4). This chimeric protein lost calcium and ATP binding domains, thereby strongly disturbing the reticulum endoplasmic calcium homeostasis and inducing apoptosis (Chami et al. 2000).\n",

            "text": "The second mechanism, which is directly related to viral integration, is called insertional mutagenesis. In this case, tumorigenesis is a slow process directly related to the viral integration site, which disturbs the cell homeostasis. Indeed, viral integration alters and modulates the expression of cellular nearby genes (Fig. 4). A first scenario is the result of gene disruption by the viral integration event. If the disrupted gene is a tumor suppressor gene for example, this may ultimately lead to cellular transformation. Second, viral integration occurring close to cellular oncogenes may result in viral promoter-induced overexpression of the oncogene. The best illustration of this event occurred in a gene therapy trial aiming at correcting the severe combined immunodeficiency-X1 disease (SCID-X1) using a gammaretroviral vector providing a functional IL2RG* gene (Cavazzana-Calvo et al. 2000). Although this trial was successful, restoring an immune function, 4 out of 9 patients developed leukemia in the 5 years following viral transduction (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008). The analysis of viral integration sites in the transduced cells identified integration events nearby the LMO2* proto-oncogene, yielding to LMO2 overexpression (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008). The aberrant expression of LMO2 is a major determinant of T cell immortalization as recently demonstrated in vitro after gammaretroviral transduction of the proto-oncogene LMO2 in T cells (Newrzela et al. 2011). Although it was shown that MLV vectors preferentially integrate at promoters and regions close to the transcription start site (Kim et al. 2008, 2011; Mitchell et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2003), exon 1 of LMO2 locus was shown to be a hotspot for MLV integration in T cells, with 1 integration out of 2.125 \u00b4 105 (Yamada et al. 2009). Nonetheless, new MLV-derived vectors containing chromatin insulator elements from the chicken \u03b2-globin have been engineered to block the viral enhancer activity of the promoter, thereby reducing the risk of MLV-induced leukemia (Emery 2011).",

They selected a few genes targeted by retroviral integration and compared the interactome of these gene products between non-infected and HIV-1 infected macrophages. By computational analysis, they showed that integration in 5 selected genes induced profound alteration of the global transcription network (Soto-Giron and Garcia-Vallejo 2012). Another illustration of cell homeostasis deregulation upon viral integration, leading to tumor development, resides in HBV infected cells, where multiple pathways involved in cell cycle are deregulated, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, Ras/MAPK, PTEN/Akt, p14ARF/p53, and TGF-\u03b2 pathways (Neuveut et al. 2010).",

Indeed, despite a very efficient combination therapy (highly active antiretroviral therapy, HAART), HIV-1 is not eliminated from the organism and rebounds upon HAART interruption. Although the mechanisms underlying virus reactivation, allowing the virus to exit a transcriptionally silent and latent state in favor of a productive state releasing infectious particles, is not yet completely understood, it is nevertheless obvious that this can only be achieved thanks to the presence of the integrated HIV-1 genome in the infected cell (Joos et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2000). To date, it is thought that the only way to successful HIV-1 eradication resides in purging the viral reservoir, and that this could be achieved by reactivation of viral transcription from latently infected cells (Siliciano 2010).",

In the case of HIV-1, three major players are currently involved in latency: (i) the availability of cellular transcription factors. Indeed, a current model implies that HIV-1 is transcriptionally active in activated infected T cells, and that when the T cells evolve to a resting memory state, many transcription factors become unavailable, thus silencing viral transcription (Coiras et al. 2009). Furthermore, epigenetic modifications implicating de novo methylation of the provirus and chromatin remodeling complexes may also contribute to the transcriptional silencing of the integrated retrovirus (Agbottah et al. 2006; Blazkova et al. 2009; Kauder et al. 2009; Mahmoudi et al. 2006; Treand et al. 2006). (ii) The level of the viral transactivator protein, Tat, which is responsible for efficient viral transcription, and (iii) the site of viral integration. Indeed, it has been shown that infected cells in a latent state were characterized with proviruses in heterochromatin and centromeric regions (Jordan et al. 2003; Lewinski et al. 2005) and were found more often in sense orientation, leading to decreased viral transcription due to RNA interference (Shan et al. 2011).",

This latent HHV-6 is non cytopathic as completely or partially silent.

It has been shown that the syncytin-1 gene corresponds to the env gene of an endogenous retrovirus belonging to the HERV-W family that was fixed in the human genome 45 million years ago (Mi et al. 2000).
