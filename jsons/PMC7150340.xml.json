            "text": "An infectious disease can be defined as an illness due to a pathogen or its toxic product, which arises through transmission from an infected person, an infected animal, or a contaminated inanimate object to a susceptible host. Infectious diseases are responsible for an immense global burden of disease that impacts public health systems and economies worldwide, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. In 2013, infectious diseases resulted in over 45 million years lost due to disability and over 9 million deaths (Naghavi et al., 2015). Lower respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are among the top causes of overall global mortality (Vos et al., 2015). Infectious diseases also include emerging infectious diseases; diseases that have newly appeared (e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range (e.g., extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) and Zika virus (Morse, 1995). Infectious disease control and prevention relies on a thorough understanding of the factors determining transmission. This article summarizes some of the fundamental principles of infectious disease transmission while highlighting many of the agent, host, and environmental determinants of these diseases that are of particular import to public health professionals.",

Pathogenicity refers to the ability of an agent to cause disease, given infection, and virulence is the likelihood of causing severe disease among those with disease. Virulence reflects structural and/or biochemical properties of an infectious agent. Notably, the virulence of some infectious agents is due to the production of toxins (endotoxins and/or exotoxins) such as the cholera toxin that induces a profuse watery diarrhea. Some exotoxins cause disease independent of infection, as for example, the staphylococcal enterotoxins that can cause foodborne diseases. Agent characteristics can be measured in various ways. Infectivity is often quantified in terms of the infectious dose 50 (ID\n50), the amount of agent required to infect 50% of a specified host population. ID50 varies widely, from 10 organisms for Shigella dysenteriae to 106\u20131011 for Vibrio cholerae (Gama et al., 2012; FDA, 2012). Infectivity and pathogenicity can be measured by the attack rate, the number of exposed individuals who develop disease (as it may be difficult to determine if someone has been infected if they do not have outward manifestations of disease). Virulence is often measured by the case fatality rate or proportion of diseased individuals who die from the disease.",

Susceptibility refers to the ability of an exposed individual (or group of individuals) to resist infection or limit disease as a result of their biological makeup. Factors influencing susceptibility include both innate, genetic factors and acquired factors such as the specific immunity that develops following exposure or vaccination. The malaria resistance afforded carriers of the sickle cell trait exemplifies how genetics can influence susceptibility to infectious disease (Aidoo et al., 2002). Susceptibility is also affected by extremes of age, stress, pregnancy, nutritional status, and underlying diseases. These latter factors can impact immunity to infection, as illustrated by immunologically na\u00efve infant populations, aging populations experiencing immune senescence, and immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients.",

            "text": "The innate and adaptive immune responses are critical components of the host response to infectious agents (Table 1\n). Each of these responses is carried out by cells of a distinct hematopoietic stem cell lineage: the myeloid lineage gives rise to innate immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells) and the lymphoid lineage gives rise to adaptive immune cells (e.g., T cells, B cells). The innate immune response is an immediate, nonspecific response to broad groups of pathogens. By contrast, the adaptive immune response is initially generated over a period of 3\u20134 days, it recognizes specific pathogens, and it consists of two main branches: (1) T cell-mediated immunity (a.k.a. cell-mediated immunity) and (2) B cell-mediated immunity (a.k.a. humoral or antibody-mediated immunity). The innate and adaptive responses also differ in that the latter has memory, whereas the former does not. As a consequence of adaptive immune memory, if an infectious agent makes a second attempt to infect a host, pathogen-specific memory T cells, memory B cells, and antibodies will mount a secondary immune response that is much more rapid and intense than the initial, primary response and, thus, better able to inhibit infection and disease. Immune memory is the basis for the use of vaccines that are given in an attempt to stimulate an individual's adaptive immune system to generate pathogen-specific immune memory. Of note, in some cases the response of the immune system to an infectious agent can contribute to disease progress. For example, immunopathology is thought to be responsible for the severe acute disease that can occur following infection with a dengue virus that is serotypically distinct from that causing initial dengue infection (Screaton et al., 2015).",

The duration and efficacy of immunity following immunization by natural infection or vaccination varies depending upon the infecting agent, quality of the vaccine, type of vaccine (i.e., live or inactivated virus, subunit, etc.), and ability of the host to generate an immune response. For example, a single yellow fever vaccination appears to confer lifelong immunity, whereas immune protection against tetanus requires repeat vaccination every 10 years (Staples et al., 2015; Broder et al., 2006). In malaria-endemic areas, natural immunity to malaria usually develops by 5 years of age and, while protective from severe disease and death, it is incomplete and short-lived (Langhorne et al., 2008).",

For example, after exposure to a dog bite, an individual who seeks medical care will receive both active and passive postexposure immune prophylaxis consisting of rabies vaccine (to induce the host immune response) and rabies immune globulin (to provide immediate passive protection against rabies).

Sporadic diseases occur occasionally and unpredictably, while endemic diseases occur with predictable regularity. Levels of endemicity can be classified as holoendemic, hyperendemic, mesoendemic, or hypoendemic depending upon whether a disease occurs with, respectively, extreme, high, moderate, or low frequency. For some infectious diseases, such as malaria, levels of endemicity are well defined and used as parameters for identifying disease risk and implementing control activities. Malaria endemicity is quantified based upon rates of palpable enlarged spleens in a defined (usually pediatric) age group: holoendemic >75%, hyperendemic 51\u201375%, mesoendemic 11\u201350%, and hypoendemic <10% (Hay et al., 2008). An epidemic refers to an, often acute, increase in disease cases above the baseline level. An epidemic may reflect an escalation in the occurrence of an endemic disease or the appearance of a disease that did not previously exist in a population. The term outbreak is often used synonymously with epidemic but can occasionally refer to an epidemic occurring in a more limited geographical area; for example, a foodborne illness associated with a group gathering. By contrast, a pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over a large geographic region, encompassing multiple countries or continents, or extending worldwide. Influenza commonly occurs as a seasonal epidemic, but periodically it gives rise to a global pandemic, as was the case with 2009 H1N1 influenza.",

Usually measured as a proportion (number infected/number exposed), attack rates are often calculated during an outbreak. In some circumstances, a secondary attack rate is calculated to quantify the spread of disease to susceptible exposed persons from an index case (the case first introducing an agent into a setting) in a circumscribed population, such as in a household or hospital. During the 2003 SARS epidemic, secondary attack rates in Toronto hospitals were high but varied from 25% to 40% depending upon the hospital ward (CDC, 2003b).",

            "text": "Broadly, laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases is based on tests that either directly identify an infectious agent or provide evidence that infection has occurred by documenting agent-specific immunity in the host (Figure 5\n). Identification of an infecting agent involves either direct examination of host specimens (e.g., blood, tissue, urine) or environmental specimens, or examination following agent culture and isolation from such specimens. The main categories of analyses used in pathogen identification can be classified as phenotypic, revealing properties of the intact agent, nucleic acid-based, determining agent nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) characteristics and composition, and immunologic, detecting microbial antigen or evidence of immune response to an agent (Figure 5). Direct phenotypic analyses include both macroscopic and/or microscopic examination of specimens to determine agent morphology and staining properties. Cultured material containing large quantities of agent can undergo analyses to determine characteristics, such as biochemical enzymatic activity (enzymatic profile) and antimicrobial sensitivity, and to perform phage typing, a technique which differentiates bacterial strains according to the infectivity of strain-specific bacterial viruses (a.k.a. bacteriophages). Nucleic acid\u2013based tests often make use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify agent DNA or complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesized from messenger RNA (mRNA). The ability of pathogen-specific PCR primers to generate an amplification product can confirm or rule out involvement of a specific pathogen. Sequencing of amplified DNA fragments can also assist with pathogen identification. Restriction fragment analysis, as by pulse-field gel electrophoresis of restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA isolated from cultured material, can yield distinct \u2018DNA fingerprints\u2019 that can be used for comparing the identities of bacteria. The CDC PulseNet surveillance program uses DNA fingerprinting as the basis for detecting and defining foodborne disease outbreaks that can sometimes be quite widely dispersed (CDC, 2013). Most recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have made whole-genome sequencing a realistic subtyping method for use in foodborne outbreak investigation and surveillance (Deng et al., 2016). The objective of immunologic analysis of specimens is to reveal evidence of an agent through detection of its antigenic components with agent-specific antibodies. Serotyping refers to the grouping of variants of species of bacteria or viruses based on shared surface antigens that are identified using immunologic methodologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting.",

When humans are the reservoir, or source, of an infectious agent, early and rapid diagnosis and treatment are key to decreasing the duration of infection and risk of transmission. Both active surveillance and passive surveillance are used to detect infected cases and carriers. Some readily communicable diseases, such as Ebola, can require isolation of infected individuals to minimize the risk of transmission. As part of the global effort to eradicate dracunculiasis, several endemic countries have established case containment centers to provide treatment and support to patients with emerging Guinea worms to keep them from contaminating water sources and, thereby, exposing others (Hochberg et al., 2008). Contact tracing and quarantine are other activities employed in the control of infections originating from a human reservoir or source. During the West Africa Ebola outbreak, key control efforts focused on the tracing and daily follow-up of healthy individuals who had come in contact with Ebola patients and were potentially infected with the virus (Pandey et al., 2014).",

For some diseases (e.g., Rift Valley fever) epizootics (analogous to epidemics, but in animal populations) can actually serve as sentinel events for forecasting impending human epidemics. Once animal reservoirs (and sources) of infection are identified, approaches to prevention and control include reservoir elimination and prevention of reservoir infection. Zoonotic diseases exist in nature in predictably regular, enzootic cycles and/or epizootic cycles and are transmitted to humans via distinct pathways. The focus of prevention and control activities for these diseases reflects the extent to which a zoonotic pathogen has evolved to become established in human populations (Wolfe et al., 2007). For some zoonotic diseases (e.g. anthrax, Nipah, rabies), primary transmission always occurs from animals, with humans acting as incidental (dead end) hosts; control of these diseases thus concentrates on preventing animal-to-animal and, ultimately, animal-to-human transmission. Currently, most human cases of avian influenza are the result of human infection from birds; human-to-human transmission is extremely rare. Thus, reservoir elimination by culling infected poultry flocks is a recommended measure for controlling avian influenza in birds and preventing sporadic infection of humans (CDC, 2015). Other zoonotic diseases demonstrate varying degrees of secondary human-to-human transmission following primary transmission (a.k.a. spillover) from animals. Both rates of spillover and the ability to sustain human-to-human transmission can vary widely between zoonoses and, in consequence, control strategies can also be quite different. For example, outbreaks of Ebola arise following an initial bush animal-to-human transmission event, and subsequent human-to-human transmission is often limited (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). In contrast, the four dengue viruses originally emerged from a sylvatic cycle between non-human primates and mosquitoes, and are now sustained by a continuous human-mosquito-human cycle of transmission with outbreaks occurring as a result of infected individuals entering into na\u00efve populations (Vasilakis et al., 2011). Thus, while Ebola outbreak prevention efforts would include limiting contact with bush animals, such efforts would not be useful for prevention of dengue outbreaks. HIV is an example of a virus that emerged from an ancestral animal virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, but has evolved so that it is now HIV is an example of a virus that emerged from an ancestral animal virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, but has evolved so that it is now only transmitted human to human (Faria et al., 2014).",

Integrated vector management is defined by the WHO as, \u201ca rational decision-making process to optimize the use of resources for vector control\u201d (WHO, 2012). There are four major categories of IVM vector control strategies: biological, chemical, environmental, and mechanical. IVM interventions are chosen from these categories based upon available resources, local patterns of disease transmission, and ecology of local disease vectors. Two key elements of IVM are collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors (e.g., agriculture, engineering) to plan and carry out vector control activities, and community engagement to promote program sustainability. Another core element is the integrated approach which often permits concurrent targeting of multiple VBDs, as some diseases are transmitted by a single, common vector, and some vector control interventions can target several different vectors. In addition, combining interventions serves not only to reduce reliance on any single intervention, but also to reduce the selection pressure for insecticide and drug resistance. Table 4\n, adapted from the 2012 WHO Handbook for IVM, illustrates some of the many types of IVM activities and provides examples of VBDs that might be controlled by such interventions (WHO, 2012).",

            "text": "Diarrheal diseases primarily result from oral contact with water, food, or other vehicles contaminated with pathogenic agents originating from human or animal feces. Most (\u223c88%) of diarrhea-associated deaths are attributable to unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient hygiene (Black et al., 2003; Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al., 2008). Interruption of fecal\u2013oral transmission through provision of safe water and adequate sanitation, and promotion of personal and domestic hygiene are fundamental to diarrhea prevention and control. Fecal\u2013oral transmission of a diarrheal agent can occur via one of several routes. In 1958, Wagner and Lanoix developed a model of major transmission depicted in what has become known as the \u2018F-diagram,\u2019 based on steps within the fecal\u2013oral flow of transmission starting with the letter \u2018F\u2019: fluids (drinking water), fingers, flies, fields (crops and soil), floods (representative of surface water in general), and food (Wagner and Lanoix, 1958; Figure 7). Other F's that can be considered include facilities (e.g., settings where transmission is likely to occur such as daycare centers) and fornication. The F-diagram is useful for depicting where water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions act as barriers in the fecal\u2013oral flow of diarrheal pathogens. Safe excreta disposal and handling act as primary barriers to transmission by preventing fecal pathogens from entering the environment. Once the environment has become contaminated with pathogen-containing feces, secondary and tertiary barriers to transmission include water treatment, safe transport and storage of water, provision of sewage systems to control flooding, fly control, and good personal and domestic hygiene (e.g., food hygiene) practices (requiring adequate water quantity) (Figure 7). As with IVM, the control of diarrheal diseases increases with integration of control measures to achieve multiple barriers to fecal\u2013oral transmission.",

            "text": "The basic approach to preventing transmission of an infectious agent from a contaminated vehicle is to prevent contamination of, decontaminate, or eliminate the vehicle. Food is a common vehicle for infectious agents, and it can potentially become contaminated at any step along the food production chain of production, processing, distribution, and preparation. Production refers to the growing of plants for harvest and raising animals for food. An example of contamination at this step includes the use of fecally contaminated water for crop irrigation. Processing refers to steps such as the chopping, grinding, or pasteurizing of food to convert it into a consumer product; if the external surface of a melon is contaminated, chopping it into pieces for sale can result in contamination of the fruit. Distribution, in which food is transferred from the place where it was produced and/or processed to the consumer, can result in contamination if, for example, the transportation vehicle is not clean. Finally, preparation is the step in which food is made ready to eat; not cleaning a cutting board after cutting raw chicken can result in microbial pathogen cross-contamination of other food items. Food hygiene is the term used to describe the conditions and activities employed to prevent or limit microbial contamination of food in order to ensure food safety. Decontamination includes sterilization, the destruction of all microbial agents, and disinfection, the destruction of specific agents.",

CDC guidelines suggest two levels of precautions to stop transmission of infectious agents: Standard Precautions and transmission-based precautions (Siegel et al., 2007). Standard Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that can be acquired by contact with blood, body fluids, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes. They can be used to prevent transmission in both health-care and non-health-care settings, regardless of whether infection is suspected or confirmed. Hand hygiene is a major component of these precautions, along with use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Common PPE include gloves, gowns, face protection (e.g., eye-protecting face shields), and respiratory protection using N95 masks to prevent inhalation of airborne infectious particles (e.g., from Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Of note, depending on the circumstance, PPE can be used to prevent dispersal of infectious agents from their source by providing a barrier to the portal of exit, or to protect a susceptible individual by placing a barrier to a portal of entry. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette is used to prevent spread of infection by respiratory droplets. Main elements of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette include covering the nose and mouth area with one's elbow during coughing or sneezing or using a surgical mask to limit dissemination of infectious respiratory secretions, and hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions. Other components of standard precautions include needle stick and sharp injury prevention, safe injection practices, cleaning and disinfection of potentially contaminated equipment and other objects, and safe waste management.",

Another important element in the prevention and control of infections is the recognition and management of patients with underlying diseases and conditions that can weaken host barriers to infection. For example, TB is the leading opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, and antiretroviral therapy reduces risk of developing TB and mortality due to TB disease. Infectious complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer and transplant patients, often resulting from immunosuppression that can be primary or related to drug and/or radiation therapy.
