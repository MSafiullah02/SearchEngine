Also, current regimens include less effective drugs which require long duration follows up. This exploratory study was conducted to commence the investigation for crafting multi target epitope vaccine against its bacterial pathogen Tropheryma whipplei. The modern bioinformatics tools like VaxiJen, NETMHCII PAN 3.2, ALLER-GEN-FP, PATCH-DOCK, TOXIC-PRED, MHCPRED and IEDB were deployed, which makes the study more intensive in analyzing proteome of T. whipplei as these methods are based on robust result generating statistical algorithms ANN, HMM, and ML. This Immuno-Informatics approach leads us in the prediction of two epitopes: VLMVSAFPL and IRYLAALHL interacting with 4 and 6 HLA DRB1 alleles of MHC Class II respectively. VLMVSAFPL epitope is a part of DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta, and IRYLAALHL epitope is a part of membranous protein insertase YidC of this bacterium. Molecular-Docking and Molecular-Simulation analysis yields the perfect interaction based on Atomic contact energy, binding scores along with RMSD values (0 to 1.5 \u01fa) in selection zone. The IEDB (Immune epitope database) population coverage analysis exhibits satisfactory relevance with respect to world population.",

            "text": "George Hoyt Whipple in 1907 explains Whipple's disease, as a multisystemic chronic infectious disease. He identified silver stained rod shaped bacterium in vacuoles associated with macrophages of patients, he initially did not think of them as the cause for the disease rather he think that intestinal lipodystrophy (Whipple's disease) was caused due to some novel disturbances in fat metabolic schemes (Whipple 1907) . When the first successful treatment started by using antibiotics in 1952, determined that this bacterium might be the major causative agent of this disease (Paulley 1952 ). An electron microscopic study in 1960\u2032s provided additional support for this hypothesis (Cohen et al. 1960; Yardley and Hendrix 1961 ). Whipple's disease occurs uncommonly, as a multisystemic disorder (inexact annual frequency less than 1 per 1,000,000 populace) that specially affects middle-aged Caucasian men (Fenollar et al. 2007; Ramharter et al. 2014 , Dobbins et al. 1981 ). This bacterium was found to mostly affect small children (Keita et al. 2015) and sewage workers (Sch\u00f6niger-Hekele et al. 2007 ). Since, its first portrayal by Whipple in very beginning of first decade in twentieth century (Whipple 1907) , a limited progresses with in pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of the malady have been made. The bacterium gets internalized in to lamina propria of intestine and then make its way to mucosal macrophages, as this bacterium induces the decreased expression of CD11b in such macrophages (CD11b on macrophages frequently mediates the intracellular degradation of bacteria) causes flip in the scenario (inappropriate antigen presentation by such macrophages and dendritic cells). This specially reasons the boom in IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL-18 expression and decrease in IFN-\u03b3, which in turn causes destroy in maturation of phagosomes and decrease in thioredoxin expression, lead them unable to kill bacterium and antigen presentation (Moss et al. 2006 (Moss et al. , 2010 .",

The nearby generation of provocative cytokines through macrophages and endothelial cells within the fringe might actuate lymphocyte invasion through a defective endothelial obstruction taken after by central aggravation, indeed in immunologically ensured tissues such as joints or the neuronal domain (Schneider et al. 2008) .Currently hydroxychloroquine (600 mg/day) and doxycycline (200 mg/day) used for treatment of whipple's disease for 12-18 months, but life time follow up is required (Lagier et al. 2014) , so it is time consuming treatment process and only few handful trials were conducted in earlier studies (Feurle et al. 2013) . Nowadays epitope based vaccines provide better options in search of good treatment strategy for such type of harmful and rare malady, even if the individuals are genetically predisposed as in case of classical Whipple's disease (Trotta et al. 2017) . This modern approach of putative vaccine determination which involves the use of proteomic databases is very handy and easy to use method not only for rare bacterial pathogens, but also very effective in case of harmful viruses like Nipah (Kaushik 2019) . Tropheryma whipplei was found to be associated with major ailments like gastroenteritis and endocarditis (Fenollar et al. 2013) .",

Predicted epitopes were subjected for immunogenic properties, structural modeling and the docking with corresponding MHC II alleles to investigate the strong binding affinity. Method is more economic, time efficient, and harmless when compared to the vaccine designing and testing in wet lab and animal testing strategies (Kumar et al. 2015) . Reverse vaccinology is the suitable approach as well as novel science method that use the genomic data with the utilization of computer for the arrangement of antibodies without culturing bacterium species (Kanampalliwar et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2012) . It allow the choice in hands of human interface for selecting antigens from pathogenic set of DNA and most antigenic areas could be used to synthesize potential immunization to initiate defensive responses against such pathogenic species (Ada et al. 2018) . Epitopes based antibodies selection and production is explicitly less time consuming, economical and considered safest approach in vaccine designing. Earlier computational methods were found to be successful in analyzing genome and prediction of putative drugs for T. whipplei (Palanisamy 2018) , such studies provide motivation to craft vaccine targets by deploying in-silico approach. T-cell epitopes were screened out in this study may effectively elicit immune responses against this bacterium, and also similar type of recent study was found to be successful in determining epitope based vaccine agents for SARS-Cov2 (Joshi et al. 2020) . Brief flow chart of the study used to determine putative epitope based vaccine candidates against T. whipplei is presented in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "In present study we identified two possible epitopes that can interact with MHC-II alleles to elicit immune response on individuals namely VLMVSAFPL epitope (part of DNAdirected RNA polymerase subunit beta), and IRYLAALHL epitope (part of murein biosynthesis integral membrane protein). These epitopes exhibit better interaction with HLA DRB1 alleles, as confirmed by deploying Molecular-Docking and Molecular-Simulation studies (Adhikari et al. 2018) . Population coverage analysis was found to be satisfactory and in earlier studies it was used in strengthening vaccine prediction aspects (Misra et al. 2011) . Very similar studies were also conducted successfully for related bacterium Mycobacterium avium and found to be successful in predicting epitopes (Gurung et al. 2012 \u2212 321.1, \u2212 353.5, \u2212 353.5, \u2212 353.5, \u2212 349.1 respectively) in docking results similar type of methodology was seen in recent studies in screening epitopes for SARS-Cov-2 (Joshi et al. 2020) . Both selected epitopes exhibit structural integrity as possess less than 35% instability index score, and half life greater than 20 h for mammalian reticulocytes, this makes the screening criteria more reliable. Also, more than 85% residues of selected epitopes come under favorable region in Ramachandran plot analysis (Fig. 9 ). Still no one has used vaccine based treatments for Whipple's disease, as it is thought to be rare and possess reduced genome but considered one of the harmful pathogen of human ( Raoult et al. 2003; La Scola et al. 2001; Marth et al. 2016) .The effectiveness of epitope based vaccines for treatment of endocarditis has already been claimed (Priyadarshini et al. 2014) . But in our study we found the short peptides that can easily be synthesized and deployed in developing immunity in Caucasian populations against Whipple's disease.",
