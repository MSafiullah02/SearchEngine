Specific considerations include:-Strategies for supporting respiration after extubation, such as noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen, are relatively contraindicated due to their ability to aerosolise SARS-CoV-2.3\n-Extubation should ideally take place in a negative pressure room, if available.-All non-essential staff should exit the room prior to extubation.2\n-Personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions are required during extubation, and for personnel entering the room for at least 30 min after extubation.6\n,\n7\n-Limit the need for subsequent staff interactions with:oProphylactic anti-emetics.8\noAdequate analgesia, consider regional anaesthesia.\n-Perform oropharyngeal suction with vigilance as this may generate aerosols.9\n-Antitussive drugs such as remifentanil, lidocaine and dexmedetomidine reduce the risk of coughing and minimise agitation on extubation.10\n,\n11\n\n",

A potential risk of the technique is kinking of the TT where it is directed under the mask, although this problem has not occurred during our mannequin testing. We did consider alternative techniques including passing the TT through the port of a standard facemask, or the self-sealing port of a bronchoscopy facemask, but those methods involve clamping the TT to remove the connector, and were not always possible depending on the exact geometry of the mask. We have found the mask-over-tube extubation technique simple to adopt and teach, and it can be practiced during extubation of elective patients without COVID-19. Strict adherence to PPE is essential for reducing the risk of viral transmission to healthcare providers, however techniques to reduce droplets and aerosolisation are also strongly recommended. The technique we describe for extubation could reduce the risk to anaesthesia providers.",
