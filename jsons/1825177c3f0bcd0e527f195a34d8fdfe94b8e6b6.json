By limited protease digestion we defined a monomeric C-terminal domain of P that can bind to N-RNA. The atomic structure of this domain was determined and previously described mutations that interfere with binding of P to N-RNA could now be interpreted. There appears to be two features involved in this activity situated at opposite surfaces of the molecule: a positively charged patch and a hydrophobic pocket with an exposed tryptophan side-chain. Other previously published work suggests a conformational change in P when it binds to N-RNA, which may imply the repositioning of two helices that would expose a hydrophobic groove for interaction with N. This domain of rabies virus P is structurally unrelated to the N-RNA binding domains of the phosphoproteins of Sendai and measles virus that are members of the same order of viruses, the nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses.

Negative strand RNA viruses cause important human and animal disease. In 2003, measles virus killed 760,000 children, mainly in Africa and Asia (WHO report, 2003) . Rabies virus kills about 50,000 people per year in these continents but is also an increasing health concern in the USA. 1 The vRNA of these viruses is bound to the viral nucleoprotein (N) with a virusfamily-specific nucleotide-N stoichiometry.

[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The polymerase complex cannot transcribe or replicate the naked vRNA; vRNA has to be bound to N in order to be a functional template. 12 P has a second role in the viral life-cycle as a chaperone for N that is not yet bound to vRNA (N 0 ). When recombinant N is expressed alone in eukaryotic cells it binds non-specifically to cellular RNA to form N-RNA complexes that have the same structure as the viral N-RNA structures. 5, [13] [14] [15] However, when N and P are co-expressed, a soluble complex between N 0 and P is formed that does not contain RNA.

Mokola virus is closely related to rabies virus and the sequences of the P proteins of the two viruses are very similar ( Figure 2 ). The mutated residues in the Mokola virus P protein were compared to the corresponding residues in the rabies virus P protein.

This suggests that binding of P to N-RNA may be associated with a conformational change resulting in the rearrangement of helices 5 and 6. These C-terminal 24 residues of P can be deleted without inhibiting the binding of P to N-RNA. 21 It is, therefore, likely that a5 and a6 can occupy a conformation that is different from the one that is found in the crystal structure. Phosphorylation of S271 may have an influence on the structure of the protein in this area. Figure 7C and D show the molecule with the W-hole in yellow and helices 5 and 6 in green. These two helices lie in a hydrophobic groove (orange) and their displacement would expose this groove to the solvent.

This is in contrast to the transcription and replication activities of the Sendai virus phosphoprotein that does require the presence of the oligomerisation domain. 39, 40 The difference between these two phosphoproteins could be due to a higher affinity of rabies virus phosphoprotein for its N-RNA than that of Sendai virus P for its N-RNA.

Heterologous recombination has been documented for Nidovirales (Arteri-and Coronaviruses), positive strand RNA viruses, where homologous RNA recombination by the viral polymerase is part of the mechanism for the production of mRNAs. 52, 53 Homologous recombination inside gene segments of segmented negative strand RNA viruses has also been shown or suggested; recombination between the polymerase genes of two Arenavirus strains has been documented 54 whereas recombination in the haemagglutinin gene of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus has been suggested from sequence comparisons. 55 For heterologous recombination to occur, the viral polymerase has to jump from the viral N-RNA template to a nucleoprotein-encapsidated host mRNA and then back again to the viral RNA template. Non-segmented negative strand virus nucleoprotein expressed alone in bacterial or eukaryotic cells binds in a non-specific fashion to cellular RNAs. 5, 13, [56] [57] [58] Although during a virus infection most newly made N is first bound to the phosphoprotein in the N 0 -P complex for delivery onto newly made vRNA, it is very likely that some N will nevertheless bind to cellular RNA providing an N-cellular RNA template for the viral polymerase. It is also known that these polymerases can jump either inside the viral N-RNA template 59 or from the viral template to the newly copied, N-bound complementary strand in order to form copy-back interfering particles. 60 Heterologous recombination for the influenza viruses was suggested from the structure of the influenza C virus glycoprotein. 61 From a comparison between the influenza A and C haemagglutinin structures it was suggested that the influenza virus haemagglutinin consists of an ancestral fusion protein combined with an independent haemagglutinin domain, for influenza C virus further complemented by an esterase domain spliced into this haemagglutinin domain. The esterase domain is homologous to bovine brain and bacterial esterases. 61 Finally, when Khatchikian et al. 62 tried to select for a pathogenic turkey influenza virus to grow in chicken cells, they obtained a virulent mutant that had acquired 54 nt coming from the 28 S ribosomal RNA of the infected cells.
