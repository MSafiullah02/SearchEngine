            "text": "Arenaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that often establish chronic infection in their natural rodent hosts [1]. The geographic distribution of each arenavirus is determined by the range of habitats of its natural rodent hosts [2] (Table 1\n). Infection in humans is believed mainly through respiratory exposure to virus containing aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials and may cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans [1], [3]. Studies involving intragastric infection of rhesus macaques and mice experimentally and serological survey in rodent consumers suggest that gastric mucosa could also be targeted by the virus [4], [5], [6]. Based on the antigenicity, phylogeny, and geographical distribution, arenaviruses can be divided into the OW (Old World) (Lassa\u2013lymphocytic choriomeningitis complex) arenaviruses and the NW (New World) (Tacaribe complex) arenaviruses [7], [8] (Table 1). The LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) from the OW arenaviruses is the prototype arenavirus and is often used in research laboratories. LCMV can cause central nervous system and immunopathological diseases in mice and in immunosuppressed humans [9], [10], [11]. OW LASV (Lassa virus) is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a major public health concern in western Africa [12], [13]. The NW arenaviruses are further classified into clades A, B, and C NW arenaviruses [7]. The clade A NW arenavirus include PICV (Pichinde virus), Pirital virus, Parana virus, Flexal virus, and Allpahuayo virus, which are not known to cause disease in humans. The clade B contains many important human pathogens, such as JUNV (Junin virus), MACV (Machupo virus), GTOV (Guanarito virus), SABV (Sabia virus), and CHAV (Chapare virus). The pathogens listed above are the etiological agents of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fever, respectively [2]. CHAV infection has been recently associated with human hemorrhagic fever cases in Bolivia [14]. Clade B also contains the non-pathogenic TCRV (Tacaribe virus), AMAV (Amapari virus), and Cupixi virus. Clade C contains the non-pathogenic Oliveros virus and Latino virus [1], [7].",

Ribavirin and immune plasma from recovered patients are effective treatments for VHFs caused by arenaviruses [16], [17]. Because these pathogenic arenaviruses cause significant morbidity and high mortality, they have become public health concerns in their endemic regions and consequently are classified as the Category A Pathogen Agents by the National Institutes of Health (US). Many of these highly pathogenic viruses must be handled in Biosafety Level 4 facilities, which hamper research. However, infection of certain rodents with some PICV and TCRV strains can cause disease that is similar to VHF in humans [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. These surrogate virus models are used in basic studies and preclinical safety evaluation at early stages [24].",

For example, the pathogenic NW JUNV can use both hTfR1 and the TfR1 ortholog of its natural host, Calomys musculinus. Meanwhile, non-pathogenic clade B NW arenaviruses (i.e., AMAV and TCRV) use TfR1 orthologs but not the hTfR1 as the cellular receptor [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. The OW and the clade A and C NW arenaviruses use the \u03b1-dystroglycan as their cellular receptor [33], [34].

Upon recognition of PAMPs, PRRs are rapidly activated and stimulate host cells to counteract virus infection by mounting the early innate immune response in order to prevent further infection and virus growth. Induction of type I IFN expression is controlled by three different classes of PRRs [44], [45], [46]: RLRs (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors), TLRs (Toll-like receptors), and NOD (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptors [43], [47], [48]. RLRs are composed of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2) that are cytosolic helicases sensing features unique to viral RNA [49]. RIG-I detects 5\u2032- triphosphate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and short (< 2 kb) double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in most cell types, whereas MDA5 is responsible for recognition of virus-derived, long (> 2 kb) dsRNA and a synthetic dsRNA [poly(I:C)] [46], [50], [51]. Upon binding to viral RNA, activated RIG-I and MDA5 transduce the signal to the downstream IPS-1 (IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1) (also known as MAVS, VISA, or CARDIF) [52] on mitochondrial membranes. IPS-1 serves as a scaffold to recruit the signal adapter, TRAF-3 (tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor-3); the activated complex activates the IKK\u03b5/TBK-1 (serine/threonine kinases I\u03baB kinase \u03b5/TANK-binding kinase-1) complex and the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 complexes [53], [54], [55] (Fig. 1\n). Activated IKK\u03b5/TBK-1 complex phosphorylates IRF-3 (IFN regulatory factor-3) and/or IRF-7, while the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 complex phosphorylates NF-\u03baB. These transcription factors undergo nuclear translocation and initiate the expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, and other proinflammatory cytokines [44], [56], [57], [58].",

            "text": "TLRs are a group of transmembrane proteins contributing to the recognition of various pathogen-specific molecules. Most TLRs are expressed on cell surfaces, while TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and in some cases TLR3 are located in intracellular endosomal compartments [59]. TLR3 and TLR7/TLR8 play critical roles in recognizing viral dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively [60]. TLR2 detects measles virus hemagglutinin protein [61], and TLR4 is implicated in the detection of envelope proteins of respiratory syncytial virus and mouse mammary tumor virus [62], [63]. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, rely on MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) as the adaptor molecule to activate the downstream TAK1 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1) [64], [65]. Activated TAK1 phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex, followed by activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of various proinflammatory cytokines [66], [67]. TLR3 and TLR4 pathways are dependent on Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing INF-\u03b2 [68], [69] as the downstream adaptor molecule, which activates the TRAF-3\u2013TBK-1/IKK\u03b5 cascade and mediates the phosphorylation of IRF-3 to initiate IFN-\u03b2 expression [70]. Expressed type I IFNs are secreted from infected cells and interact with the IFN receptor on cell surface in an autocrine or paracrine manner [71]. This triggers the expression of a spectrum of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [72], [73], which ultimately execute the IFN-induced antiviral activities in a collaborative manner by targeting various steps of viral life cycle [74]. Expression of some ISGs could also be mediated directly by IRF-3/IRF-7 independent of IFN production, particularly in dendritic cells and macrophages [75], [76].",

LCMV causes either an acute infection followed by virus clearance or a chronic/persistent infection in described murine models. The difference in the disease outcome is largely determined by the IFN response at the early stage of virus infection [77], [78], [79]. A potent IFN response may inhibit virus replication at early stage and induce virus-specific CD8 + T cell, resulting in virus clearance. However, a modest level of IFN production at early stage could eventually allow persistent infection, as IFN response is unable to suppress virus multiplication to the level that is required for virus clearance by CD8 + T cells later during infection [80], [81], [82], [83]. On the other hand, the details of the immune response to other arenaviruses in their natural hosts are largely unknown. Experiments using NW JUNV and NW Catarina virus to infect of their natural hosts, C. musculinus and Neotoma micropus, respectively, showed age-dependent antibody elevation and persistent infection [84], [85], [86]. It is possible that arenaviruses may be maintained in their natural hosts by suppression of both innate and adaptive antiviral responses.",

IFN induction has also been found in animal models of AHF [102], [103]. IFN likely contributes to the AHF diseases as IFN-\u03b1 level was linked to the severity of symptoms such as fever, chills, and backache [100]. Also, high levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1 in AHF patients have been linked to low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and platelet abnormality [104]. This abnormality has been also demonstrated experimentally in an in vitro study showing that JUNV infection of human hematopoietic progenitor CD34 + cell and human megakaryocyte impairs platelet formation and function via type I IFN pathway [105]. Induction of type I IFNs has also been reported in the rhesus macaque model during JUNV and MACV infections [102], [106], although it is still unclear if increased IFN is related to disease progression and time to death.",

TNF-\u03b1 likely plays a key role in the pathogenesis in a lethal neonatal mice model of TCRV infection [19], [20], [110]. MACV infection causes diseases in STAT-1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1) knockout mice [111], albeit with symptoms different from humans. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) are detected in the serum of MACV-infected STAT1 knockout mice [111]. In contrast, LASV did not induce fatal infection in IFN-\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice [88]. However, STAT1 knockout mice develop lethal disease upon LASV infection [112]. These results indicate that IFN might play an important role in controlling some NW arenavirus infections and that cytokines might contribute to pathogenesis in the murine model.",

PICV-infected hamsters display elevated level of type I IFN in serum [22]. PICV infection of guinea pigs has been used as a model to study the pathogenesis of the OW LASV. While the non-pathogenic P2 strain of PICV causes mild disease, the P18 strain, which has been serially passaged in guinea pigs, causes lethal hemorrhagic fever in guinea pigs [113]. Elevated levels of TNF in serum and spleen are initially observed in inbred guinea pigs during the late phases of the pathogenic P18 strain infection [21]. However, a later study reported that P18 strain-infected peripheral blood leukocytes had decreased transcripts for cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) relative to that of P2 strain-infected cells; meanwhile, reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-12 p40 mRNAs have also been observed in peritoneal cells from P18 strain-infected guinea pigs relative to that of mock-infected animals [23]. The result of latter is also consistent with previous studies showing that JUNV and LASV infection either inhibit or fail to induce these cytokines in human macrophages [90], [114]. Intriguingly, these IFNs and inflammatory cytokines seem to be basically elevated in human pathogenic NW arenavirus (e.g., JUNV and MACV) infections in patients and animal models but not in OW arenavirus (e.g., LASV) infection.",

Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, and epithelial cells involved in innate immune response are also suggested as the initial target cells for JUNV and other arenaviruses [115], [116], [117], [118]. TLR2, but not TLR4, has been shown to recognize JUNV GPs and initiate IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production in mouse macrophages [119]. Similarly, some strains of non-pathogenic OW LCMV are also recognized by TLR2 and MyD88/Mal pathway in murine central nervous system glial cells and macrophages [120], [121]. However, no elevation in the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, or TNF-\u03b1 was detected in cultures of human monocytes and macrophages infected with the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV, suggesting that these cells might not be the cellular source of IFN and cytokine production in vivo or that the cytokine production in vitro is different from the one detected in vivo\n[114]. Meanwhile, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 were expressed in non-pathogenic NW TACV-infected cells in the same study [114], indicating its inability to suppress innate immune response in these cells. On the other hand, RIG-I-mediated IFN production and ISG expression are readily detected in human lung epithelial A549 cells during the infection of both pathogenic and vaccine strains of JUNV [122], which also suggests that JUNV-infected parenchymal cells could be a cellular source of IFN in vivo. OW LCMV infection induces type I IFN responses in HEK293 cells and murine embryonic fibroblast cells in a RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent manner [123]. Further studies are required to clarify the involvement of MDA5 in IFN response during JUNV and other NW arenavirus infections.",

            "text": "Arenaviruses have utilized several strategies to evade host innate immune response, particularly to subvert the IFN pathway. NPs from almost all arenaviruses examined are capable of interfering with type I IFN induction in vitro\n[123], [127], [128], [129]. In a co-transfection assay, NPs of LCMV, LASV, PICV, JUNV, and MACV inhibited the Sendai virus-induced nuclear translocation of IRF-3 in Vero cells [128] (Fig. 1). Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IRF-3 promoter expression is dose dependently inhibited by different arenavirus NPs in 293T cells [128]. LCMV NP has been shown to directly interact with RIG-I and MDA5 [123]. However, a mutant NP lacking IFN inhibitory activity is still able to bind to both RIG-I and MDA5 proteins, suggesting that NP binding alone is not sufficient to interfere with RIG-I/MDA5 function. The IFN antagonist activity is mapped to the C terminal DIEGR motif (D382, G385, E384, and R386) of the LCMV NP [127], [128], [129]. Interestingly, this DIEGR motif also partially overlaps in amino acid sequence with the five amino acids (D382, E384, D459, H517, and D552) that are critical for NP 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity as determined by structure studies [130], [131]. Mutation of these five amino acids that are required for exonuclease activity diminishes the NP exonuclease activity and also coincidentally abolishes the NP IFN antagonistic activity in reporter assays [131]. It has been proposed that the exonuclease activity could reduce the opportunity of viral RNA to be exposed to RIG-I or MDA5, a hypothesis that still remains to be confirmed in virus-infected cells (Fig. 1). LASV with mutations of these key amino acid residues shows enhanced IFN and cytokine production in infected cells, supporting a link of exonuclease activity and NP-mediated suppression of IFN response [132]. Additionally, NP directly interacts to and blocks IKK\u03b5 to interfere with IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation [133] (Fig. 1). Meanwhile, NPs from NW and OW arenaviruses (e.g., LCMV, LASV, PICV, JUNV, and MACV) inhibit the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB [134]. This could allow arenavirus to down-regulate the NF-\u03baB pathway that is required for expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and IFN.",

The impact of innate immune response on arenavirus infection and its role in pathogenesis varies remarkably depending on the virus, host, age, infection dose, infection route, and immune conditions. Based on studies on many non-pathogenic viruses, such as TACV [114], Mopeia virus (a non-pathogenic OW arenavirus closely related to LASV) [139], and some less virulent strains of PICV [126] or LCMV [77], [78], [79], it is tempting to conclude that the viral pathogenicity is often inversely associated with a higher level of cytokine or IFN response, indicative of the inhibitory effect of potent innate immune response against virus infection. In contrast, the pathogenic OW arenaviruses, such as LASV and LCMV, utilize several strategies to efficiently subvert or evade host innate immune response and cause severe diseases. However, the infection by VHF-causing NW arenavirus JUNV is distinct; JUNV triggers strong cytokine and IFN response in humans, which is associated with high mobility and mortality [100], [101]. It is worthy to note that many arenaviruses (e.g., JUNV and MACV) are relatively resistant to IFN treatment in vitro\n[122], [140]. As the innate immune response could be either beneficial or detrimental to the host, future studies are required to investigate whether dysregulated innate immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis of VHF-causing NW arenaviruses, similar to influenza virus [141] and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus infection in humans [142], [143]. Also, studying the role of the innate immune response during the NW arenavirus infection will help us to design new strategies to develop vaccines and treatments against VHF-causing NW arenavirus infection.",

Arenavirus NPs possess 3\u2032 to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity and are proposed to degrade viral dsRNA or ssRNA to reduce the exposure of viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA5. Z protein of the NW arenavirus, but not of the OW arenavirus, inhibits RIG-I signaling cascade probably as a result of its direct binding to RIG-I protein. NP further interacts with IKK\u03b5 and inhibits TBK-1/IKK\u03b5 activation to interfere with phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 or IRF-7. NP prevents activation of NF-\u03baB. It is still unclear whether suppression of TBK-1/IKK\u03b5 complex by NP could directly lead to inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. On the other hand, NW arenavirus JUNV GP is recognized by TLR2 pathway and triggers IFN and cytokine production in mouse macrophages.",
