Among them, the classicalalal susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) is the most widely adopted one for characterizing the epidemic of COVID-19 outbreak in both China and other countries 25 . Based on SEIR model, one can also assess the effectiveness of various measures since the outbreak 23,24,26-28 , which seems to be a difficult task for general statistics methods. SEIR model was also utilized to compare the effects of lock-down of Hubei province on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and Beijing 29 . As the dynamical model can reach interpretable conclusions on the outbreak, a cascade of SEIR models are developed to simulate the processes of transmission from infection source, hosts, reservoir to human 30 . There are also notable generalizations of SEIR model for evaluation of the transmission risk and prediction of patient number, in which model, each group is divided into two subpopulations, the quarantined and unquarantined 23, 24 . The extension of classical SEIR model with delays 31,32 is another routine to simulate the incubation period and the period before recovery. However, due to the lack of official data and the change of diagnostic caliber in the early stage of the outbreak, most early published models were either too complicated to avoid the overfitting problem, or the parameters were estimated based on limited and less accurate data, resulting in questionable predictions.",

The adding of a new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with the recovery state takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1 and characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we consider discrete time, see SI).

Especially, to take the improvement of public health into account, such as promoting wearing face masks, more effective contact tracing and more strict locking-down of communities, we assume that the susceptible population is stably decreasing and thus introduce a positive protection rate \u03b1 into the model.

As confirmed in Fig. 2a -d, the cure rate \u03bb(t) is gradually increasing with the time, while the mortality rate \u03ba(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and becomes stabilized after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency medical teams, the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f and could provide some clue on the infection rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over time, but shows a remarkable difference among various regions, which could be attributed to different quarantine policies and implements inside and outside Hubei (or Wuhan), since a less severe region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a confirmed case. A similar regional difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g -h, Hubei and Wuhan overall show a much higher severe condition rate than Shanghai. Although it is generally expected that the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined, or to be recovered from illness, but we do not find a strong evidence for the necessity of including time delay (see SI for more details).

And then for each fixed \u03b3 \u22121 , we explore its influence on other parameters (\u03b2 = 1 nearly unchanged), initial values, as well as the population dynamics of quarantined cases and infected cases during best fitting. From Fig. 3a -b, to produce the same outcome, the protection rate \u03b1 and the reciprocal of the quarantine time \u03b4 \u22121 are both decreasing with the latent time \u03b3 \u22121 , which is consistent with the fact that longer latent time requires longer quarantine time. Meanwhile, the initial values of exposed cases and infectious cases are increasing with the latent time. Since E 0 and I 0 include asymptomatic patients, they both should be larger than the number of quarantined cases. Furthermore, as the time period between the starting date of our simulation (Jan. 20th) and the initial outbreak of COVID-19 (generally believed to be earlier than Jan. 1st) is much longer than the latent 6 time (3-6 days), E 0 and I 0 have to be close to each other, which makes only their sum E 0 +I 0 matters during the fitting. An additional important finding is that in all cases \u03b2 is always very close to 1, which agrees with the observation that COVID-19 has an extremely strong infectious ability. Nearly every unprotected person will be infected after a direct contact with the COVID-19 patients 5,33,34 .",

Similarly, although the average protection rate for Hubei * is higher than that of Wuhan, it is still significantly 8 lower than other regions. Secondly, the quarantine time for Beijing and Shanghai are the shortest, that for Mainland * is in between. Again, the quarantine time for Wuhan and Hubei * are the longest.

With respect to the parameters and initial conditions listed in Table 1 , we make an astonishing finding that, for all three cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 all point to 20-25 days before Jan. 20th (the starting date for public data and our modeling). It means the epidemic of COVID-19 in these regions is no later than Jan. 1st (see Fig. 5d ), in agreement with reports by Li et al. 5, 33, 34 . And in this stage (from Jan. 1st to Jan. 20th), the number of total infected cases follows a nice exponential curve with the doubling time around 2 days.
