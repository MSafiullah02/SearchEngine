The incidence of CAP is lower in developed countries: in the US it is about 35\u201340/1000/person-years in children < 5 years old, 20/1000 person-years in children 5\u201310 years old, and 10/1000 person-years in children > 10 years old. Despite this, approximately 50% of children with CAP < 5 years old, 20% between 5\u201310 years old, and 10% of children > 10 years old need to be hospitalized [5]. These numbers demonstrate the burden that CAP represents for society and for economic healthcare resources.",

The resulting curve, integrated with S. pneumoniae MIC for amoxicillin, showed that, for intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC 4 mg/ml) CAP, the amoxicillin plasma concentration remained above the pneumococcal MIC level for about 4 hours. Therefore, amoxicillin administered every 8 hours maintains blood and lung concentrations that are above S. pneumoniae MIC for enough time to allow S. pneumoniae eradication. A longer interval between administrations (every 12 hours), in case of intermediate resistant serotypes, would not permit having a sufficient antimicrobial plasma concentration [28]. Similarly, penicillin G needs more frequent administrations than other beta-lactams, because of its shorter half-life [13].",

Indeed, this population is at increased risk to develop a CAP by aggressive S. pneumoniae serotypes and other less common organisms, as H. influenza. Unlike Pneumococcus, type B and nontypeable H. influenzae became resistant to penicillin through the production of \u03b2-lactamase. Therefore, treatment with the association of amoxicillin with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor ensures a broader coverage [30]. It should be noted that the addition of a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor does not change the amoxicillin kinetic curve; as a consequence, in order to treat a pneumococcal infection with the association of amoxicillin with clavulanate, the therapy should be administered every 8 hours [26].",

On the other hand, all CA-MRSA strains are susceptible to vancomycin, which is considered by all guidelines as the drug of choice if MRSA is suspected [7, 13]. Although linezolid has been recently demonstrated as efficient as vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, its use should be considered as a second-line treatment for cost consideration (linezolid costs >10 times more than vancomycin) and because linezolid-resistant MRSA has already been described [46, 47].",

In a retrospective study by Zec et al., during a 6-month period in 2014, first- and third-generation cephalosporins were given to children with CAP in 40.4% and 31.7% of cases, respectively. Penicillin was used in 25% of cases [83]. In an Italian 1-day point-prevalence survey on antimicrobial use in hospitalized neonates and children in 2012, the main indication for treatment in children was LRTI (34%), with higher prevalence of third-generation cephalosporins (43.3%) followed by macrolides accounting for 26.8%.

The study by Awor et al. in Uganda in 2015 offers an important cause for reflection, since it shows that adherence to guidelines may be successfully implemented even in a nonhospital environment. In their 8-month quasi-experimental analysis, they investigated the visits and the prescriptions made by drug shop sellers, underlining how this class of health workers plays an important role in providing healthcare to populations in rural areas. Their result is that 91% of the children with pneumonia that were visited by drug shop sellers received amoxicillin, the highest rate of its prescription among all the studies included in this review [69].",
