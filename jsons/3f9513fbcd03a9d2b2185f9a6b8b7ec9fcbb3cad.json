Assays that simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single reaction can potentially reduce the time, labour and cost of diagnostic testing and disease surveillance.

This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a novel microarray platform that integrates and automates capture probe printing with all post-amplification steps of a microarray assay (e.g. hybridization, washing, reporting) for detection and differentiation of eight bovine viruses. The post-PCR automated electronic microarray process described here takes approximately 4 h to complete and requires a NanoChip 400 instrument and microfluidic electronic microarray cartridges with 400 test sites. The multiplex PCR and microarray assay accurately detected a panel of 37 strains of the target viruses, and the capture probes showed no cross-reactivity with heterologous viruses, 23 non-target viruses including ones that are related genetically, or cause similar clinical signs in ruminants, and samples from healthy animals. For laboratories without the electronic microarray instrumentation and specialized consumables, the multiplex PCR may potentially be used as a stand-alone assay as the size of the amplicons for each target with the exception of BVDV and VSV is different. As seen in previous electronic microarray assays developed for pathogens that affect poultry and porcine, the assay was able to detect viruses in clinical samples and also mixed infections in samples with two different viruses (Lung et al., 2012 (Lung et al., , 2015 . Based on available data for VSV, the electronic microarray results were comparable to an in-house realtime RT-PCR. Both tests detected the VSV-IND strain tested at 2 dpi, and the electronic microarray detected the tested VSV-NJ strain at 2 dpi, 1 day earlier than the real-time RT-PCR. Although not thoroughly investigated in this study, previous published and ongoing unpublished work on the electronic microarray platform have shown that depending on the assay and the target, the sensitivity of multiplex PCRs can be comparable, or sometimes less than the component singleplex PCRs. In this study, we further observed that the downstream electronic microarray had a lower sensitivity for BoHV-1 and PPV when compared with the multiplex PCR. This reduced sensitivity for some targets on the microarray when compared with the preceding multiplex PCR has been observed in other electronic microarray assays (O. Lung, unpublished results) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1583, "end": 1601, "text": "(Lung et al., 2012", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1622, "text": "(Lung et al., , 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2562, "text": "Lung, unpublished results)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The electronic microarray platform has several unique features as a potential tool for pathogen detection and typing. The ability to computer-control the printing of all capture probes, all post-PCR steps of a microarray analysis on a single instrument, and activate each of the 400 test sites of the microarray independently gives the user the ability to customize assay configurations on-site for any subset or the entire set of target viruses. Thus, there is no need to predetermine targets and stockpile pre-printed array. The ability of the platform to electrophoretically address amplicons to the array also allows instantaneous hybridization when compared to passive hybridization. The stringency of detection can be modulated by computer-controlled washing and reporting temperature, and the use of temperature gradients (stepwise increase or decrease in temperature). By increasing the stringency for detection sequences found in different strains, viruses with a minimum of three mismatches can be successfully differentiated (O. Lung, unpublished results) . New instrumentation that further integrates PCR amplification with the automated microarray in a single computer-controlled instrument has been developed that will further streamline the workflow of microarray-based assays. Despite a thorough in silico evaluation of the primers and probes against publically available sequences of the genetically variable BTV serotypes 1-24 at the time of assay design, further evaluation of primers and probe sequences against new sequences as they become available is necessary. Due to limited resources in this project, additional validation with true field samples, and incorporation of an internal control, is desirable, especially with upcoming new instrumentation that further integrates PCR with the electronic microarray. With further validation, electronic microarray assays have potential as a tool for surveillance of multiple targets or may be used in conjunction with a real-time RT-PCR for FMDV (Reid et al., 2002 (Reid et al., , 2003 King et al., 2006; Moniwa et al., 2007) for rapid and simultaneous differential diagnosis of FMD-like vesicular diseases in cattle.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1040, "end": 1066, "text": "Lung, unpublished results)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2032, "text": "(Reid et al., 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2053, "text": "(Reid et al., , 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2072, "text": "King et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2093, "text": "Moniwa et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Microarray-based molecular detection of foot-and-mouth disease, vesicular stomatitis and swine vesicular disease viruses, using padlock probes", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Ban Er", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Gyarmati", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Yacoub", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Hakhverdyan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Stenberg", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "O", "middle": [], "last": "Ericsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Nilsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "U", "middle": [], "last": "Landegren", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Bel", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "J.
