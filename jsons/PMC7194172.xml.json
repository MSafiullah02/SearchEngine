Infection may lead to rapid death, reduced survival and a nutritionally demanding immune response that could reduce host fecundity (Hudson, Dobson & Newborn 1998; Burthe et al. 2008). These effects may prevail throughout a population or affect specific categories of hosts in terms of age, sex or social status (Sapolsky 2005; Sahin & DePinho 2010). A host\u2019s ability to mount an effective immune response to infection is likely to depend on its body condition (Beldomenico et al. 2008). One important factor determining body condition is access to resources (Nelson & Demas 1996; Tompkins & Begon 1999) which will be modified by factors including resource abundance, intra\u2010 and interspecific competition and, in most social species, social status (Tompkins & Begon 1999; Hofer & East 2003; Archie et al. 2006).",

Experimental studies indicate that pathogens can regulate host populations (\u2018top\u2013down\u2019 regulation) by reducing host survival or fecundity (Hudson, Dobson & Newborn 1998; Tompkins & Begon 1999), and observational studies revealed significant host mortalities following pathogen epidemics (Dietz et al. 1989; Hawkins et al. 2006).",

Thus, although pathogens can negatively impact host populations, their impact could be modulated by \u2018bottom\u2013up\u2019 processes mediated by resource access. The extent of \u2018top\u2013down\u2019 processes is expected to vary over time because of stochastic fluctuation in pathogen circulation, host immunity and host population structure and size (Lloyd\u2010Smith et al. 2005; Martin, Weil & Nelson 2008). Furthermore, when pathogen\u2010mediated mortality sufficiently reduces negative density dependence, thereby causing an increase in fecundity, pathogen\u2010mediated mortality need not necessarily decrease host populations (Forchhammer & Asferg 2000; Begon, Townsend & Harper 2006). A robust and comprehensive assessment of the demographic consequences of pathogens, including their ecological effects and impact on the viability of host populations (Jones et al. 2008), is therefore preferably achieved through long\u2010term monitoring of pathogens and their host populations.",

Prevalence of external signs of infection with this bacterium sharply increased between September 2002 and February 2003 (H\u00f6ner et al. 2006; hereafter, 2002 and 2003 are termed \u2018outbreak years\u2019), and 12\u00b75% of hyenas died within days of developing external signs (H\u00f6ner et al. 2006). Because it was proposed that pathological effects of Streptococcus equi increase with stressful conditions such as high host density and adverse environmental conditions (Timoney 1999; Robert et al. 2005), we predicted that socially subordinate and nutritionally disadvantaged hyenas should be most susceptible to severe infection and death induced by this bacterium.",

The resident hyena population on the 250 km2 floor of the Ngorongoro Crater in northern Tanzania was monitored between April 1996 and April 2010; it contained eight hyena clans at a mean density of 0\u00b79 adults per km2 (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). Cubs were reared in communal dens inside clan territories; thus, numerous cubs (mean = 5\u00b79 \u00b1 3\u00b75 cubs per den, n = 61 dens from eight clans during the outbreak years) rested together in underground burrows each day. The density of large herbivores on the Crater floor (80 individuals per km2) is high compared with other ecosystems (Runyoro et al. 1995). Large herbivores moved seasonally within the Crater, causing substantial changes in prey densities in clan territories (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). When prey density in a territory was low, hyenas foraged outside their territory (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). The Crater hyena population size in the 1960s was estimated at 469 individuals (Kruuk 1972). At the start of our study, it had declined to 171 hyenas, most probably because vegetation changes mediated a reduction in the abundance of the main prey (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). Several hundred domestic stock utilised the Crater floor for grazing and drinking throughout the year.",

Hyenas aged <12 months were classified as cubs, those between 12 and 24 months as yearlings and those \u2265 24 months as adults. Adult rank was based on the outcome of dyadic interactions using submissive responses (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). Cubs and yearlings were assigned the rank of their mother. Clan and population sizes were determined annually on 1 January unless otherwise stated. Clan size was the total number of members, and population size was the total number of hyenas resident on the Crater floor. Possible density dependence was assessed using annual population sizes and methods refined by Dennis & Taper (1994). The null hypothesis was that the population was undergoing stochastic exponential growth and included random walk as a special case; the alternative hypothesis was that the population was undergoing stochastic, discrete logistic growth, i.e. was subject to density dependence. Demonstrating density dependence is here equivalent to rejecting the null hypothesis of density independence. The distribution of the test statistic under both null and alternative hypothesis was obtained through parametric bootstrapping and tested with a likelihood ratio test (Dennis & Taper 1994). Dennis & Taper (1994) showed that this method of assessing possible density dependence was superior to other methods in terms of both biological realism and statistical properties (power, avoiding excessive type I error). Application of this method showed no evidence of density dependence during the study period (see Results section). This permitted us to directly estimate the growth trajectory in the absence of disease outbreaks and compare it with the observed population growth.",

Individuals were considered dead if their body was found or if they were not seen for one year. Females that cease to be observed were most likely dead because they rarely disperse (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005). Males usually disperse to clans on the Crater floor but a few disperse elsewhere (H\u00f6ner et al. 2007). Thus, the absence of males from the Crater floor may indicate death or dispersal elsewhere. To assess possible changes in the proportion of males dispersing elsewhere, we calculated the number and proportion of young females of all adult and yearling hyenas for each clan and year following H\u00f6ner et al. (2007) because males disperse to clans that contain the largest number of young females (H\u00f6ner et al. 2007).",

Thus, die\u2010offs in Crater lions in 1997 and/or 2001 thought to be associated with outbreaks of CDV (Kissui & Packer 2004; Munson et al. 2008) might be expected to decrease hyena cub survival and hyena population size in 1997 and 2001 and decrease population growth in these years and the 2 years that followed because of subsequent low recruitment. Our results do not conform to these expectations, and we found no evidence that the Crater hyena population sustained a CDV outbreak in 1997 and/or 2001.

Because females are socially dominant and have priority of access to food in their territory, they are likely to maintain a better nutritional and immune status than immigrant males. Recently independent yearlings are inexperienced at foraging and rarely undertook extra\u2010territorial foraging excursions to escape periods of low prey abundance in their own territory. Adult males are the most subordinate class in hyena clans and usually feed only after adult females and their offspring have left a carcass (Kruuk 1972), and although they frequently undertake extra\u2010territorial foraging excursions (H\u00f6ner et al. 2007), they are subordinate to all territory owners during these excursions (Hofer & East 1993). Our results suggest that adult females are less compromised by S. equi ruminatorum infection because of lower levels of nutritional stress than yearlings and adult males. As we currently know little about routes of transmission between hyenas and immune responses to contain infection, we cannot exclude the possibility of differences between these classes of hyenas in either exposure to loads of infectious particles or the efficacy of immune responses. A possible link between poor nutritional state and susceptibility to infections is supported by the fact that external signs appeared in hyenas when prey abundance in an infected individual\u2019s territory was low.",

This suggests that yearlings and adult males more rapidly succumbed to the disease and were thus less often observed with external signs than adult females.

Between 1996 and 2002, Crater hyena clan and population sizes increased by a factor of almost two (Fig. 2). In hyenas, individual corticosteroid concentrations induced by social stress are elevated in large clans (Goymann et al. 2003). The increase in clan sizes between 1996 and 2002 is likely to have increased contact rates among clan members and competition for food, thereby elevating levels of social and nutritional stress. It is possible that by 2002, contact rates between hyenas, number of individuals shedding bacteria, and levels of stress were sufficient to precipitate an outbreak. There was no evidence that the outbreak was the result of an increase in consumption of zebras and buffaloes, two prey species in the Crater known to be infected with S. equi ruminatorum, because hyenas consumed zebras and buffaloes at similar rates and densities of zebras and buffaloes were similar during outbreak and nonoutbreak years.",

Several results suggest that many hyenas mounted a successful immune response to infection during the outbreak and that this herd immunity may have been sufficient to prevent further outbreaks before the end of the study. These include (i) a low prevalence of external signs and apparent lack of decrease in survivorship of hyenas exposed to individuals likely to be actively shedding bacteria, (ii) a lack of decrease in survivorship of individuals that cleared signs of infection, (iii) a reduction in the severity of signs expressed by hyenas after the outbreak years and (iv) the fact that only one of the 14 hyenas surviving symptomatic infection expressed external signs on other occasions.",

Frequent exposure to the bacterium and consistently high rates of transmission can stimulate high levels of immunity within host populations, thereby reducing the number of susceptible individuals (Anderson & May 1985) and limiting the impact of a pathogen on a host population (Guiserix et al. 2007). The estimates of R\n0 suggest that during the outbreak, the bacterium could potentially be transmitted within each clan without transmission from other clans, populations or species. Owing to the highly social nature of hyenas, there is extensive contact between clan members, often involving transfer of body fluids such as saliva, nasal discharge, wound secretion or bacterial particles expelled during coughing. Furthermore, when feeding, particularly when consuming bones, hyenas extensively salivate, and at large carcasses many hyenas, including members of other clans (H\u00f6ner et al. 2005), that gather to feed. Streptococcus equi can persist for prolonged periods on substrates such as wood (up to 3 days under natural conditions in temperate environments; Weese, Jarlot & Morley 2008) and be transmitted indirectly via contaminated water or food (Reif 1979; Timoney 1999). If S. equi ruminatorum is present in saliva and can persist in water or carcasses of infected prey or hyenas, social interactions and feeding sites provide considerable potential for intraspecific transmission within and between clans and prolonged maintenance of, and immunity against, these bacteria. Furthermore, the carcasses of hyenas that died of infection would presumably hold high levels of bacterial particles that would be transmitted to hyenas scavenging from such carcasses.",

More recently we discovered that buffaloes in the Crater, wild dogs in an area northwest of the Crater and camels Camelus dromedarius kept by Maasai are infected with similar strains (Goller et al. 2010; O.P. H\u00f6ner, B. Wachter, S. Speck, M. Grobbel, unpublished data).
