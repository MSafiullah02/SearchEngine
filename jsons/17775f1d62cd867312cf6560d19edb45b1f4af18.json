Still, the danger of a second wave of infections is omnipresent and it is clear, that every policy of the lockdown has to be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy, before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential tracing and breaking of infection-chains is a promising and comparably straightforward strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. In order to quantify the benefits of tracing and similar policies we developed an agent-based model that not only validly depicts the spread of the disease, but allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We will describe our model and perform case studies in which we use the model to quantify impact of contact tracing in different characteristics and draw valuable conclusions about contact tracing policies in general.",

As a consequence, the simulation's capabilities of dealing with multi-variate calibration problems are limited and the model is unhandy to generate short-time prognoses.

We assume that this is mainly due to two reasons: First of all, the number originates from the calibration data which is not cleaned with respect to a reporting bias. It is legitimate to assume that the slope of the actual curve at the beginning of the disease-wave is smaller than reported (see report for \"nowcasting\" attempts by the Robert Koch Institute(RKI, [18] ) in Germany. Yet, the second, more important reason for our comparably high R0 is that typical estimates for this number, gained by fitting a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) or an exponential model, are usually lower than analogous R0 estimates based on fitting a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model -or generally any model that includes a latency/incubation phase (see [23] ). Anyway, the modelled R0 indicates that the infection rate needs to be reduced below 1/R0 \u2248 22% of its original value in order to reach a fully contained behaviour of the disease, either by reduction of contacts and/or strict distancing and hygiene measures. As a matter of fact, this number is almost impossible to interpret in real life, mainly because there are lots of processes for which infectivity can hardly be reduced properly. The most important of these are definitely contacts within households which hardly be reduced by any measurement or policy.",

Temporary closing of workplaces is clearly the least \"precise\" of the modelled policies as it affects the highest number of persons. Isolating household members is more \"accurate\", but leaves many infections outside of households untraced. Our model suggests that the better the disease is contained, the higher the percentage of infections within households, and consequently, the more effective isolation of household members of infectious persons turns out to be. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the height of the peak of the disease and the maximum number of agents in preventive isolation for all baselines and tracing policies. It reveals a highly interesting interplay between the number of isolated persons and the maximum peak height of the disease wave: On the one hand, a lower peak height implies stricter quarantine policies and more persons affected by them. On the other hand, a lower peak height leads to fewer persons requiring isolation. As the latter impact is nonlinear, the negative correlating impact dominates the positive one: if the disease is contained well, strict tracing policies are less costly than loose ones. For example, the number of preventive quarantined persons in the high compliance scenario increased to about 37% of the population with the combined tracing and decreased again to 28% with the 75% individual tracing although the policy is more restrictive. Compared to the low compliance scenario in which the corresponding numbers were 53% and 51% the same effect is visible, but less marked.",

A school-sampler iteratively generates schools with a random size/capacity (truncated normal distribution) until the sum of all capacities matches the known number of pupils in reality. Each school is furthermore sampled a position (latitude and longitude) analogous to the sampling for person-locations (see [12] ). In a second step, schools are \"filled\" with person agents. In this process, model agents with age between 6 and 18 are assigned to a school via a region-specific distribution analogous to the sampling of leisure-time contacts (see 2. 1.4) . Clearly, the number of model agents in this age group is larger than the number of known pupils. Consequently, we force distribution of all 6 to 14 year old agents, and distribute as many 15 to 18 year old agents as possible. All remaining 15 to 18 year old agents are considered to be working.",

This number corresponds to an estimated count of initial infection clusters in the country, but actually hardly influences the outcome. Furthermore, the agent-based simulation is run and interrupted by a state event, namely if the cumulative number of confirmed agents in the model is greater or equal to a specific value C(t\u22121), where t\u22121 refers to a self chosen point in time and C(t\u22121) to the reported number of positive tests in reality until t\u22121. For this process, t\u22121 must be chosen properly so that the reported number of positive tests is large enough to be representative yet before implementation of any policies. As soon as the simulation is interrupted by the state-event, the timelines of simulation and reality are synced: t\u22121 in reality becomes t\u22121 in the simulation. The initialise-simulation is continued, considering all policies that have been implemented in reality, until, finally, t0 is reached. Properly calibrated by a calibration routine (see Section 5.1.4), the initialise-simulation contains approximately the same cumulative number of confirmed agents as the corresponding reported number in the real system. The initialise-simulation is finished by exporting parts of the final state of the simulation. This refers to all households that contain either infected or recovered agents which are finally written into a file. With this strategy, an initial population is generated that contains not only a valid approximation of the confirmed cases, but also a valid estimate for the unknown pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, a correct distribution of their future planned events and a correct household distribution as well.",
