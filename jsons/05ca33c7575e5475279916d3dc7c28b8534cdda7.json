However, considering these 10 preliminary data, our Institution is starting to administrate anticoagulant doses of low-molecular 11 weight heparin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, after monitoring coagulation tests, kidney 12 and liver functions. 13",

            "text": "by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the last month, the Unit of Vascular Surgery of the 8 Teaching Hospital S. Matteo, in Pavia, one of the hub Centers for COVID-19 in Lombardy, the 9 Italian region most affected by the pandemics, was requested to perform 30 compression 10 ultrasound scan (CUS) of the venous system, of both lower and upper limbs, of COVID-19 non-11 ICU patients with signs or symptoms suspected for DVT, and 16 of them resulted positive; 6 12 more had no DVT but superficial thrombophlebitis or upper limbs lymphedema. The most 13 frequent localization of the thrombus was the iliac-femoral-popliteal axis, followed by the 14 brachial-axillary veins and the calf veins (Tab.I). 4 cases developed from a central vein catheter 15 placed in the femoral vein. Although the numbers are too small to perform statistical analysis, 16 the same period in 2019 could provide a term of comparison: in March 2019, the same Unit 17 performed 24 CUS on the whole Hospital and found only 5 cases of DVT. 18 Currently, no literature exists about the pathogenetic mechanism of DVT in COVID-19 patients. 19 A relationship was found between DVT and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 20 influenza A H1N1, for which an enhanced leukocyte adhesion to the vein walls due to the 21 production of inflammatory molecules was hypothesized, and empirical anticoagulation was 22 proposed in all patients with severe ARDS. 3 Production of pro-coagulant factors, such as D-23 dimer, tissue factor, etc. is another possible mechanism that has been well outlined in other 1 community-acquired pneumonias, although no relationship with DVT has been established; a 2 similar pro-coagulant stimulation can occur also in COVID-19 infection. 4 A third possible 3 favoring element, which could also explain the upper limbs involvement, is the use of continuous 4 positive airway pressure (c-PAP) ventilator, which is often tied in a way that can compress the 5 superficial or deep, vessels of the upper limbs: all patients with involvement of the upper limbs, 6 in fact, were on c-PAP therapy. 7Unfortunately, no data are yet available on the prognosis of patients developing a DVT during a 8 COVID-19 infection, so further research should inquire how the two conditions interact with 9",
