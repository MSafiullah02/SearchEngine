The recognition constitutes a crucial step of host defence during infection. PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like RNA receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors (Opitz et al. 2010) . PRRs sense evolutionarily conserved structures on pathogens called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and specific endogenous molecules released after cell injury called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In the alveolar compartment, PRRs are expressed in macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells, dendritic cells and in recruited immune cells. PRRs play a key role in the inflammatory response to microbial infection and sterile tissue injury. PRR activation triggers production of inflammatory cytokines, interferons and chemokines on transcriptional and post-translational levels (Opitz et al. 2010) , leading to the activation of local cells and recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils. At best, these inflammatory cascades will lead to pathogen clearance and finally survival. However, ongoing PAMP and DAMP release from dying bacteria and injured cells, respectively, may lead to an overactivation of the immune response. This over-activation results in uncontrolled production of cytokines, chemokines and lipid mediators, accumulation and activation of leukocytes, inappropriate activation of complement and coagulation cascades and eventually, endothelial barrier disruption.",

In contrast to other vascular beds, in the lungs neutrophils transmigrate across the capillary endothelium. Stimulation of neutrophils with various inflammatory agents causes cytoskeletal rearrangements, thereby forming peripheral actin rims, leading to neutrophil stiffening and trapping in the capillary bed (Yoshida et al. 2006) . Although the initial trapping is independent from cell surface expression of integrins and selectins, further neutrophil recruitment may depend on these cell adhesion molecules in distinct scenarios (reviewed in Grommes and Soehnlein 2011) . Interestingly, adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium and alveolar recruitment of neutrophils do not necessarily cause a significant change in vascular permeability (Martin et al. 1989; Rosengren et al. 1991) . In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or cremaster vessel preparations, it was shown that during the process of neutrophil transmigration the endothelium forms \"transmigratory cups/endothelial domes\" that completely encapsulate the emigrating neutrophils, thereby retaining barrier function (Carman and Springer 2004; Phillipson et al. 2008) . Furthermore, ring-like structures of neutrophil leukocyte integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) were shown to be associated with neutrophil transmigration (Shaw et al. 2004 ). However, under pathologic circumstances neutrophils contribute to vascular barrier dysfunction by secretion of soluble mediators causing endothelial contraction, neutrophil-endothelial adhesion-mediated mechanisms, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and liberation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).",

TNF\u03b1 leads to MLCK and Rho kinase (ROCK)-dependent actin stress fibre generation in endothelial cells and induces p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent disarrangement of the microtubule system and thereby loss of intercellular VE-cadherin. However, only blocking microtubule breakdown strongly protected against barrier failure induced by TNF\u03b1, whereas inhibiting ROCK or MLCK did not increase transcellular resistance (Petrache et al. 2001) . Other soluble mediators of neutrophils involved in endothelial barrier disruption include: (1) thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is processed from neutrophil-derived arachidonic acid by endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and binds to the TXR (Kim et al. 2010 ); (2) leukotriene A4 (LTA4), which is metabolized into LTC4 by endothelial LTC4 synthetase and binds to the endothelial cysteinyl LT receptor subtype 2 (CysLT2R); and (3) CXC chemokine ligands CXCL1, -2, -3 and -8 which bind to CXC chemokine receptor CXCR2 (reviewed in DiStasi and Ley 2009).",

NETs can trap and kill bacteria but on the other hand may also cause harm. NETs and particularly NET-bound histones possess high cellular cytotoxicity, leading to destabilization of endothelial and potentially epithelial barrier function (Saffarzadeh et al. 2012 ). In the lungs, this may result in high permeability lung edema. NET formation has been observed in lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), transfusion, influenza virus or Klebsiella pneumoniae (Papayannopoulos et al. 2010; Narasaraju et al. 2011; Caudrillier et al. 2012; Saffarzadeh et al. 2012) . The induction of NET formation by neutrophils is highly accelerated by binding of activated thrombocytes to neutrophils and is involved in organ failure in septic mice (Clark et al. 2007 ). Accordingly, NET formation was ameliorated by antiplatelet therapy in transfusionrelated lung injury (TRALI) (Caudrillier et al. 2012) . To date, the significance of pulmonary NET formation in acute lung injury (ALI) has not been determined, but remains a field of interest as degradation of NETs by DNAse, neutralization of histone-mediated cytotoxicity by for example, polysialic acids, or reduction of netosis by targeting thrombocytes represent potential therapeutic approaches in humans. However, further preclinical evidence is needed to assess the significance and rationale of therapeutic NET targeting in ARDS.",

Upon activation, they secrete various factors, including TXA2, which was shown to increase endothelial permeability in vitro and in vivo through upregulation of interleukin (IL)-8 (Kim et al. 2010) . Furthermore, in infection and inflammation they activate neutrophils, thereby indirectly contributing to barrier dysfunction (He et al. 2006; Zarbock et al. 2006; Looney et al. 2009 ). The formation of permeability-mediating plateletneutrophil complexes was shown to be associated with TXA2 formation (Zarbock et al. 2006) .

The classical pathway is activated by antigen-antibody complexes binding to C1q, thereby activating C1s which then cleaves C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase enzyme complex C4bC2a. In the lectin pathway, mannose binding lectins (MBL) associated with mannose-binding lectin proteases (MBLP) 1 and 2 bind to PAMPs on bacteria, thereby leading to the generation of the C3 convertase C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is triggered after contact with, for example, bacterial surfaces by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 leading to generation of a conformationally altered C3 capable of binding factor B, thereby forming the CbBb complex, the alternative C3 convertase. Both C3 convertases lead to cleavage of C3 to generate C3a and C3b. C3a is an anaphylatoxic peptide and C3b contributes to the assembly of the C5 convertase that processes C5 to the anaphylatoxin C5a and to C5b which is part of the membrane attack complex C5b-9. While C5b-9 causes cell lysis, C3a and C5a induce inflammatory responses and vascular permeability. In endothelial cells, both anaphylatoxins evoked stress fibre generation and thereby cell contraction, although with a different response kinetic. C3a stimulation led to a transient increase in stress fibre generation, while the response after exposure to C5a was delayed and prolonged (Schraufstatter et al. 2002) . Notably, C3a and C5a activate different signal transduction cascades in endothelial cells. While C5a-induced permeability was dependent on activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Src kinase and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, C3a triggered signal transduction pathways controlled by ROCK (Schraufstatter et al. 2002) .",

Interestingly, C3 deficiency in mice was not associated with attenuated immune complex-mediated lung injury and vascular permeability, while blocking of C5a was shown to be protective. These findings suggest a different complement activation pathway in the absence of C3 with thrombin acting as C5 convertase (Huber-Lang et al. 2006 ). This compensatory adaptive pathway was also demonstrated to be active in C3 knockout mice suffering from acute tracheal allograft rejection that showed aggravated microvascular injury, while C5a inhibition was protective (Khan et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Another system organized into proteolytic cascades and involved in tissue injury and inflammation is the coagulation system. Intrapulmonary fibrin deposition resulting from abnormal fibrin turnover is a characteristic feature of ALI and some components of the coagulation system may correlate with disease severity (Prabhakaran et al. 2003; Glas et al. 2013) . Elevated fibrin turnover is caused by activation of the tissue factor VII pathway, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels and therefore decreased fibrinolytic activity and reduced antithrombin III levels (Prabhakaran et al. 2003; Hofstra et al. 2011) . Further, decreased activity of the anticoagulant protein C contributes to intrapulmonary fibrin deposition. This decreased protein C activity is based on reduced protein C production as well as shedding of the cell surface protein thrombomodulin which is an important cofactor for the activation of protein C . Pulmonary coagulopathy is observed after severe pulmonary permeability edema with alveolar flooding, but it may also promote inflammation and vascular permeability and worsen ALI. The serine protease thrombin is the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Protease activated receptor (PAR) ligation mediates proinflammatory effects of thrombin including release of cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which increases vascular permeability (Hippenstiel et al. 1998) . Moreover, thrombin induces activation of endothelial MLCK and thereby cell contraction, and acts as C5 convertase generating the anaphylatoxic peptide C5a, which induces inflammatory responses and vascular permeability (Cirino et al. 1996; Huber-Lang et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2010; Glas et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2013 ).",

            "text": "As outlined above, pattern recognition receptor signalling is involved in the development of barrier dysfunction. More specifically, and as an example, TLR4 signalling has been intensively studied regarding its impact on endo-epithelial barrier dysfunction. TLR4 is activated by both exogenous (e.g. LPS; Chow et al. 1999 ) and endogenous (e.g. high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein, oxidized phospholipid) pro-inflammatory stimuli (Park et al. 2004; Imai et al. 2008) . Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the permeability-enhancing effect of LPS (Mehta and Malik 2006) . Further, elevated systemic LPS levels were associated with the severity of sepsis and related organ failure (Marshall et al. 2004 ). The critical role of TLR4 in regulating vascular permeability was convincingly demonstrated by the observation that mice lacking TLR4 were protected against lung injury due to various stimuli including LPS, oleic acid, cecal ligation and puncture and gut or lung ischemia/reperfusion injury (Imai et al. 2008; Zanotti et al. 2009; Hilberath et al. 2011; Ben et al. 2012; Tauseef et al. 2012 ). TLR4-mediated signalling predominantly activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway which induces inflammatory gene transcription (Chow et al. 1999) . LPS binds to the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex and NF-\u03baB activation is induced via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK2 and IRAK4 (Medvedev et al. 2002; Kawagoe et al. 2008) . Furthermore, intracellular diacylglycerol (DAG) levels were increased after recognition of LPS by TLR4, leading to direct activation of transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channels. The resultant TRPC6-mediated calcium influx into endothelial cells activated MLCK and thereby phosphorylation of MLC leading to cell contraction. Further, MLCK also promoted LPS-induced NF-\u03baBrelated inflammatory responses that contribute to lung vascular barrier dysfunction (Tauseef et al. 2012) . Binding of LPS to TLR4 was also shown to activate the Src family kinases leading to phosphorylation of zonula adherens proteins and consequently disruption of endothelial barrier integrity (Gong et al. 2008) .",

In this context, the synthetic TLR4 antagonist eritoran was developed that inhibits binding of LPS to MD2 and therefore suppresses TLR4/ MD2-mediated signalling. Indeed, eritoran was shown to reduce pulmonary inflammation in different animal models (Mullarkey et al. 2003) as well as in healthy humans exposed to a bolus infusion of LPS (Lynn et al. 2003) . In a phase II, placebo-controlled trial, patients with severe sepsis and high predicted risk of death that were treated with eritoran showed a trend towards lower mortality (Tidswell et al. 2010) . However, in a recent phase III trial of patients with severe sepsis, administration of eritoran had no significant impact on mortality or relevant secondary outcome parameters (Opal et al. 2013) , questioning the rationale for the therapeutic use of TLR4 antagonists in sepsis and related organ failure including ARDS. Since various DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized by many PRRs leading to NF-\u03baBmediated transcription of inflammatory genes, targeting downstream effectors in the inflammatory cascade may be more reasonable (Opal et al. 2013 ).",

Ang-1 and Ang-2 are currently the best described angiopoietins and well-known regulators of angiogenesis, inflammation and vascular leakage (reviewed in David et al. 2013; Eklund and Saharinen 2013) . Constitutive Ang-1 expression is found in different cell types including pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, thrombocytes and megakaryocytes (Eklund and Saharinen 2013) . Activation of Tie2 by Ang-1 leads to endothelial quiescence and stabilization of barrier function. In contrast, Ang-2 is primarily expressed by endothelial cells and stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (Fiedler et al. 2004 ), from where it can be rapidly released upon endothelial activation by inflammatory stimuli including TNF\u03b1 and thrombin (Fiedler et al. 2004; Fiedler et al. 2006) . Ang-2 acts as a functionally antagonistic ligand at the Tie2 receptor, thereby destabilizing the quiescent endothelium and promoting inflammation and vascular permeability (Scharpfenecker et al. 2005; Fiedler et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "The expression of Ang-2 is transcriptionally upregulated by different factors including thrombin, hypoxia and VEGF (Oh et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2002) . In a murine model of endotoxemia induced by LPS injection, functional inhibition of the Ang-1/Tie-2 pathway was observed with increased pulmonary expression and synthesis of Ang-2 (Mofarrahi et al. 2008 ). In patients with sepsis, Ang-2 serum levels were higher than in healthy volunteers and even more increased in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS (Parikh et al. 2006) . Further, plasma Ang-2 levels were shown to have prognostic value for mortality in non-infection-related, but not in infection-related ALI (Calfee et al. 2012) . In two different experimental models of sepsis, Ang-2 heterozygous mice with reduced Ang-2 levels were protected against lung injury suggesting that Ang-2 contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis besides predicting disease severity (David et al. 2012 ). This conclusion was further supported by a recent study in which Ang-2 inhibition by antibody treatment reduced microvascular alterations, hypotension and mortality in a murine model of LPS-induced systemic inflammation (Ziegler et al. 2013) . In vitro studies showed that expression of endothelial adhesion molecules as well as PMN adhesion were increased by Ang-2 and inhibited by Ang-1 (Gamble et al. 2000; Fiedler et al. 2006 ). Ang-2 was also shown to induce recruitment of monocytes expressing Tie2 to sites of inflammation (Murdoch et al. 2007) . Moreover, in experimental models of ALI, transgenic Ang-1 overexpression or treatment was associated with reduced pulmonary cytokine and adhesion molecule expression, PMN recruitment and endothelial permeability (Witzenbichler et al. 2005; Mammoto et al. 2007; McCarter et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2008 ). The protective anti-inflammatory Ang-1 effect seems to involve the direct interaction of Tie2 with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor A20 binding inhibitor (ABIN)-2 (Hughes et al. 2003) .",

The importance of this pathway was further demonstrated by the observation that downregulation of pulmonary p190 RhoGAP expression abolished the protective anti-permeability effect of Ang-1 (Mammoto et al. 2007 ). In addition, IQ domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) was suggested to be required for Ang-1-mediated Rac1 activation, thereby contributing to the regulation of endothelial permeability (David et al. 2011b) .",

Vasculotide was then proven to have therapeutic potential by preventing or counteracting vascular barrier disruption and reducing mortality in endotoxemia and established abdominal sepsis in mice (David et al. 2011a; Kumpers et al. 2011 ).",

Some sphingolipids including sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide, sphingosine (Sph) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are biologically active and have been implicated in the regulation of diverse signalling pathways. The multiple roles of the four mentioned and other sphingoid bases in the pathophysiology of lung injury have been recently summarized in detail (Natarajan et al. 2013; Uhlig and Yang 2013) . Ceramide is synthesized from serine and palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) by multiple enzymatic reactions or derived from SM by sphingomyelinase (SMase). Through the action of ceramidases, ceramide is deacylated to Sph (Canals et al. 2011) , which in turn may be phosphorylated to S1P by SphK-1 and -2. S1P is either dephosphorylated to Sph by S1P phosphatases 1 and 2 (S1PPase) or by lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP), or irreversibly cleaved by S1P lyase (S1PL) to ethanolamine phosphate and trans-2-hexadecenal.",

Interestingly, the Gram-negative endotoxin LPS and the pneumococcal exotoxin pneumolysin induce microvascular leakage by a PAF-dependent mechanism (Witzenrath et al. 2007; Uhlig and Yang 2013) , with PAF increasing endothelial permeability via acid SMase (aSMase)-dependent generation of ceramide (Goggel et al. 2004 ). Briefly, ceramide generated by aSMase leads to recruitment of caveolin-1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and TRPC6 channels into caveolae. TRPC6 channels are usually blocked by nitric oxide (NO), but caveolin-1 inhibits NO synthesis by eNOS, leading to TRPC6 activation followed by increase of [Ca 2 + ] i , MLCK activation, MLC phosphorylation, endothelial cell contraction and finally increase in vascular permeability (Uhlig and Yang 2013) .",

Coordinated activities of the biosynthetic and biodegradative enzymes maintain S1P concentrations in the ranges required for optimal physiological activities including regulation of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, survival, morphogenesis and barrier function (Le Stunff et al. 2004; Natarajan et al. 2013 ). Camerer et al. suggested that basal plasma S1P levels maintain vascular integrity. Mutant mice engineered to selectively lack S1P in the plasma displayed increased vascular leak and enhanced susceptibility to PAF stimulation, which could be reversed by S1P transfusion (Camerer et al. 2009 ). S1P acts as both an intracellular messenger (Le Stunff et al. 2004 ) and an extracellular ligand of five cell surface receptors (S1P 1\u22125 ) that are differentially expressed and coupled to various G proteins (Uhlig and Yang 2013) . Vascular endothelial cells primarily express S1P 1 , S1P 2 and S1P 3 (Hla et al. 2001 ). Physiologic plasma S1P concentrations (0.5-1 \u00b5M) maintain microvascular integrity via ligation of the G i -coupled S1P 1 (Wang and Dudek 2009) , and exogenously added S1P to pulmonary endothelial cells increased monolayer integrity rapidly and dosedependently through S1P 1 ). Ligation of endothelial S1P 1 induces activation of Rac GTPase, phosphorylation of MLC and cytoskeletal alterations, thereby mediating the barrier-protective effect of S1P . In influenza pneumonia, endothelial S1P 1 was identified to be critically involved in the regulation of immune responses. S1P 1 receptor activation attenuated cytokine storm, suppressed immune cell recruitment and reduced mortality during murine infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus suggesting that under these circumstances endothelial cells are controlling the innate immune response (Iwasaki and Medzhitov 2011) .",

Likewise, LPS increased expression of the S1P cleaving enzyme S1PL, thereby decreasing S1P levels in lung tissue. Inhibiting S1PL expression or activity reduced LPS-induced lung injury and inflammation in vitro and in vivo (Zhao et al. 2011) . Moreover, in different murine and canine in vivo models of lung injury, including ischemia/reperfusion, pancreatitis and endotoxin challenge, S1P infusion was shown to reduce pulmonary vascular leakage and inflammation Peng et al. 2004; Okazaki et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008) . However, at supraphysiologic concentrations (> 5 \u00b5M) S1P induces RhoA-dependent barrier disruption through binding to S1P 2 and S1P 3 , which couple to G i , G q and G 12/13 (Siehler and Manning 2002; Wang and Dudek 2009; Sammani et al. 2010 ). Further, S1P stimulates human airway smooth muscle cell contractility (Rosenfeldt et al. 2003) , triggers murine airway hyperresponsiveness (Roviezzo et al. 2007) , and induces bradycardia through S1P 3 (Forrest et al. 2004 ). The latter findings implicate a rather narrow therapeutic window for S1P, which may limit the therapeutic potential of S1P and drugs designed to increase S1P production or reduce S1P catabolism.",

For example, intratracheal or intravenous application of the selective S1P 1 agonist SEW-2871 reduced lung permeability upon endotoxin injection (Sammani et al. 2010) . Further, in a murine influenza infection model lung permeability and mortality were shown to be improved after intratracheal treatment with the S1P receptor 1 and 3-5 agonist AAL-R ). More widely used in clinical application is the S1P receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720), a derivative of the fungal metabolite myriocin, which shows close structural homology to Sph and has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al. 2010) . FTY720 besides being immunosuppressive, exerts endothelial barrierprotective effects in vitro (Sanchez et al. 2003) and in vivo (Dudek et al. 2007 ) and attenuated lung injury in mice following LPS stimulation Natarajan et al. 2013) . However, similar to S1P, FTY720 does affect endothelial integrity dose-dependently. We recently observed that FTY720 at lower concentrations improved barrier integrity in endothelial cell monolayers (0.01-1 \u00b5M FTY720) and in mechanically ventilated mice (0.1 mg/kg FTY720). However, higher concentrations of FTY720 induced apoptosis and barrier disruption in vitro (10-100 \u00b5M FTY720) and in mechanically ventilated mice (2 mg/kg FTY720), but not in spontaneously breathing mice (M\u00fcller et al. 2011) . Trying to translate these experimental findings into the clinical setting, it cannot be ruled out that in FTY720-treated, ventilated patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and disturbed hepatic metabolism of FTY720, increased FTY720 plasma concentrations might harm lungs that are sensitized by mechanical ventilation towards barrier-disruptive effects of the drug.",

But inhibition of VEGF-induced vascular permeability by FTY720 was independent from S1P 1 expression (Sanchez et al. 2003) , and S1P 1 internalization and degradation by FTY720 has been suggested (Cyster 2005) . Further concepts that may explain the barrier-protective effect of FTY720 have recently been reviewed (Natarajan et al. 2013) . However, similar to S1P, FTY720 induces bradycardia and dyspnea along with decreases in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) (Kappos et al. 2006) , thereby limiting its therapeutic use as a barrierprotective agent in critically ill patients.",

ROS include superoxide anions, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, hypochloric acid and other partly reduced derivatives of molecular oxygen, while metabolites of the NO metabolism like nitrite or peroxynitirite with oxidative power are summarized as RNS. Levels of ROS and RNS are tightly controlled by the protective actions of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase or glutathione. However, an imbalance of both systems due to either excessive ROS/ RNS production or critical reduction of antioxidants leads to oxidative stress which contributes to the pathogenesis of lung injury and particularly vascular permeability. ROS generated during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can modulate cellular processes by reacting with redox-reactive cystein residues on proteins, thereby altering enzyme activities and controlling cell regulatory pathways (Ray et al. 2012) . Upon inflammation, endothelial cells produce ROS/RNS involving various enzymatic systems such as NADPH oxidases, xanthine oxidase, COX and eNOS. Neutrophils generate even higher amounts of ROS due to NADPH oxydase activity, which are partly converted to the potent oxidant HOCl by myeloperoxidase. Under inflammatory conditions, neutrophils also generate RNS by inducible NO synthase (iNOS; Boueiz and Hassoun 2009) . Increased levels of ROS and RNS contribute to the pathogenesis of ALI upon different insults. Perfusion of isolated rabbit lungs with H 2 O 2 induces barrier dysfunction resulting in pulmonary edema formation (Seeger et al. 1995; Hippenstiel et al. 2002) . Exposure of endothelial cells to H 2 O 2 led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in cAMP content, and adenylate cyclase activation inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced permeability increase in endothelial cells (Suttorp et al. 1993b) . Mechanical ventilation was shown to induce enzymatic activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), and inhibiting XOR protected mice from development of pulmonary hyperpermeability (Abdulnour et al. 2006 ). Thereby, the MAPK-dependent pathway is involved in permeability induction in rodents subjected to VILI (Abdulnour et al. 2006; Dolinay et al. 2008; Park et al. 2012) . The underlying mechanisms are pro-inflammatory functions of this pathway as well as heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) phosphorylation leading to stress fibre formation and endothelial contraction (Abdulnour et al. 2006; Dolinay et al. 2008; Damarla et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, aggravated permeability and lung injury in VILI were demonstrated in mice lacking the transcription factor Nrf2 that regulates expression of several antioxidant enzymes, and antioxidant supplementation was able to rescue from exacerbation of lung injury (Papaiahgari et al. 2007) .",

Activity of eNOS can be enhanced while its expression generally stays constant. In contrast, expression of iNOS is inducible, while its activity is more or less constant. Upon inflammation, different stimuli induce NO production and release, such as pore-forming bacterial exotoxins (Suttorp et al. 1993a) . NO has multiple biological activities including control of vascular tone and permeability, regulation of mitochondrial respiration and adhesion of platelets and leukocytes. NO protects cells against oxidant injury and microbial threats, but it can also have detrimental effects, for example activation of inflammatory processes, enzyme inhibition and DNA damage. It is suggested that these varying cellular responses are highly dependent on the relative NO concentrations (Thomas et al. 2008) .",

Inhaled NO was shown to maintain endothelial integrity in isolated perfused and ventilated murine lungs upon oxidative stress or ischemia/reperfusion (Kavanagh et al. 1994; Poss et al. 1995; Schutte et al. 2001b) . Further, inhaled NO decreased pulmonary transvascular albumin flux in patients with ALI (Benzing et al. 1995) . How exactly NO exerts this barrier-stabilizing effect is largely unknown, but it is suggested that an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) through activation of guanylate cyclase (GC) may play a role. In rabbit lung ischemia/reperfusion, NO-induced barrier protection was associated with enhanced cGMP production and could be further increased by inhibition of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 (Schutte et al. 2001b) . cGMP-dependent mechanisms mediating barrier protection could also be demonstrated in lung endothelial cells upon H 2 O 2 treatment (Seeger et al. 1995; Suttorp et al. 1996) , in endothelial cells and perfused mouse lungs stimulated with thrombin (Seybold et al. 2005) , and in mice with severe pneumococcal pneumonia (Witzenrath et al. 2009 ).

Similarly, development of pulmonary hyperpermeability in response to mechanical ventilation in rats was prevented by pharmacologic inhibition of NOS (Choi et al. 2003) . Murine gain and loss of function studies verified a contribution of soluble GC to VILI (Schmidt et al. 2008) . Moreover, inhaled NO increased endothelial permeability in a rat model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and this effect was not related to an enhanced inflammatory response (Ader et al. 2007) .

            "text": "Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional, endogenous peptide that was shown to have endothelial barrier-stabilizing properties. It is expressed by different cell types including endothelial and epithelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes and leukocytes. AM is derived from a larger precursor peptide (prepro-AM) by posttranslational processing including amidation by peptidoglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM; Temmesfeld-Wollbruck et al. 2007b ). AM is a ligand for the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR), which associates with receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP)-2 and RAMP-3. AM receptor binding in endothelial cells leads to accumulation of the second messenger cAMP and activation of different kinases including protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, MAP kinases (Hippenstiel et al. 2002; Temmesfeld-Wollbruck et al. 2007b ). The importance of AM for vascular barrier integrity was highlighted by the demonstration that mice deficient for AM, CRLR, PAM or RAMP2 die prematurely of hydrops fetalis (Caron and Smithies 2001; Czyzyk et al. 2005; Dackor et al. 2006; Ichikawa-Shindo et al. 2008) . Further, expression of AM is increased under inflammatory conditions like sepsis or ALI (Matheson et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2004; Agorreta et al. 2005) and mice heterozygous for the AM gene exhibit an aggravated inflammatory response upon LPS challenge (Dackor and Caron 2007) .",

            "text": "There are at least two central mechanisms by which AM mediates endothelial barrier stabilization. The first is based on AM capability to block generation of actin stress fibres and actin myosin interaction thereby leading to endothelial cell relaxation (Temmesfeld-Wollbruck et al. 2007b ). Briefly, AM was shown to increase intracellular cAMP levels in endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting MLC phosphorylation and actin myosin interaction and finally cell contraction induced by thrombin or hydrogen peroxide in vitro, or caused by mechanical ventilation in vivo (Hippenstiel et al. 2002; Brell et al. 2005b; Hocke et al. 2006; M\u00fcller et al. 2010; Muller-Redetzky et al. 2014b ). However, in gut epithelial cells AM was shown to exert barrier-stabilizing effects independently of cAMP (Temmesfeld-Wollbruck et al. 2009 ). The second mechanism underlying AM-mediated barrier stabilization is through an increase of intercellular adherence. In a rat model of isolated perfused ileum, Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin-induced loss of the junctional protein VE-cadherin was prevented by treatment with AM (Hocke et al. 2006) . In vitro, AM protected against Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin-or thrombin-mediated loss of VE-cadherin and occludin, and increased expression of claudin-5 in brain microvascular endothelial cells (Hocke et al. 2006; Honda et al. 2006) . AM was also shown to exert immunomodulatory effects (Gonzalez-Rey et al. 2006 ), however we observed that the AM-mediated improvement of barrier function was not associated with a downregulated inflammatory response (M\u00fcller et al. 2010; Muller-Redetzky et al. 2014b) .

Stem cells are able to renew themselves and to differentiate into multiple cell types, which may contribute to regeneration of damaged organs (Cribbs et al. 2010) . In lung injury, stem cells engraft into tissue and interact with neighbouring cells, thereby directly contributing to epithelial and endothelial repair. However, the levels of engraftment seem to be too low to account for all the observed positive effects. Indeed, stem cells may additionally alter the immune response in a beneficial manner to diminish destructive inflammation while preserving the host's ability to combat pathogens (Cribbs et al. 2010) . Alterations of immune responses and improvement of cellular functions seem to result in particular from of delivery of paracrine mediators and mitochondrion-containing microvesicles by stem cells (Bhattacharya and Matthay 2013) . Allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells were also shown to restore compromised alveolar fluid clearance ex vivo in human lungs rejected for transplantation due to lung injury and dysfunction after prolonged ischemia (McAuley et al. 2014) .",

To focus on therapeutic approaches that slow down the development of pneumonia or sepsis to ARDS seems to be more promising than trying to reverse severe tissue inflammation and injury. Therefore, clinical and biological predictors of development towards ARDS are required, and future therapeutic strategies should be introduced before full-blown ARDS has developed. However, this notion should not tempt researchers to perform experimental studies that focus on preventive strategies with the start of the specific treatment before onset of the preceding disease (pneumonia or sepsis in this case), because they are far from translation into clinics.",
