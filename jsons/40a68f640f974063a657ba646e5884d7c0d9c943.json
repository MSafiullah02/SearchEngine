Drug repositioning becomes one of the most feasible approaches for combating COVID-19. This work curates the largest available experimental dataset for SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV main protease inhibitors. Based on this dataset, we develop validated machine learning models with relatively low root mean square error to screen 1553 FDA-approved drugs as well as other 7012 investigational or off-market drugs in Drug-Bank. We found that many existing drugs might be potentially potent to SARS-CoV-2. The druggability of many potent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors is analyzed. This work offers a foundation for further experimental studies of COVID-19 drug repositioning.",

Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson's disease later on [7] . In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [8] . The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [9] , the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [10, 11] , and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [8] . Due to the urgent need for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, a computational drug repositioning is one of the most feasible strategies for discovering SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",

The sequence identities of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease, RNA polymerase, and the spike protein with corresponding SARS-CoV proteins are 96.08%, 96%, and 76%, respectively [13] . We, therefore, hypothesize that a potent SARS 3CL protease inhibitor is also a potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitor. Unfortunately, there is no effective SARS therapy at present. Nevertheless, the X-ray crystal structures of both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases have been reported [14, 15] . Additionally, the binding affinities of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors from single-protein experiments are available in various databases or the original literature. Moreover, the DrugBank contains about 1600 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as more than 7000 investigational or off-market ones [16] . The aforementioned information provides a sound basis to develop an SBDR machine learning model for SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition.",

We achieve a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.80 kcal/mol, which is much better than that of similar machine learning models for standard training sets in the PDBbind database (around 1.9 kcal/mol) [18, 19] .

The most potent one is Proflavine, an acriflavine derivative. It is a disinfectant bacteriostatic against many gram-positive bacteria. Proflavine is toxic and carcinogenic in mammals and so it is used only as a surface disinfectant or for treating superficial wounds. Under the circumstance of the SARS-CoV-2, this drug might be used to clean skin or SARS-CoV-2 contaminated materials, offering an extra layer of protection. The second drug is Chloroxine, also an antibacterial drug, which is used in infectious diarrhea, disorders of the intestinal microflora, giardiasis, inflammatory bowel disease. It is notable that this drug belongs to the same family with Chloroquine, which was once considered for anti-SARS-CoV-2. However, according to our prediction, Chloroquine is not effective for SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition (BA: -6.92 kcal/mol). The third one, Demexiptiline, a tricyclic antidepressant, acts primarily as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The next one, Fluorouracil, is a medication used to treat cancer. By injection into a vein, it is used for colon cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. The fifth drug, Oteracil, is an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy, used to reduce the toxic side effects associated with chemotherapy. The next one, Tilbroquinol, is a medication used in the treatment of intestinal amoebiasis. The seventh drug, Carvedilol, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular dysfunction. The number eight drug, Mercaptopurine, is a medication used for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Specifically, it treats acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The next one is Bedaquiline, which is a medication used to treat active tuberculosis, specifically multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis along with other tuberculosis. The number ten drug, Clotrimazole, is an antifungal medication, which is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, pityriasis versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch.",

In this work, we also make use of this consensus. The 2D fingerprints are calculated from SMILES strings using RDKit software (version 2018.09.3) [32] .

In this section, we validate the performance of our machine learning predictor for the 314 inhibitors in the SARS-CoV-2 BA training set with the description provided in Table 6 . Table 6 reveals that our machine learning predictor is trained with the averaged train accuracy being the Pearson correlation coefficient (R p ) = 0.997, the Kendall's \u03c4 (\u03c4 ) = 0.971, RMSE = 0.097 kcal/mol. These metrics are based on the averaged values across 10 folds and these results indicate our model is well trained. Their averaged test performances across 10-fold of the whole SARS-CoV-2 BA set are found to be R p = 0.777, \u03c4 = 0.587, RMSE = 0.796 kcal/mol.

In this work, we curate 314 SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors with available experimental binding data from various sources to form a machine learning training set. Using this training set, we develop a gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) model to predict the binding affinities of potential SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors. The 10-fold cross-validation shows our model has a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a relatively low root mean square error of 0.80 kcal/mol. A total of 8565 drugs from DrugBank is evaluated by their predicted binding affinities. We highlight 30 FDA-approved drugs as well as 30 investigational or off-market drugs as potentially potent medications against SARS-CoV-2. We also analyze the druggability of some potent inhibitors in our training set. This work serves as a foundation for the further experimental development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",
