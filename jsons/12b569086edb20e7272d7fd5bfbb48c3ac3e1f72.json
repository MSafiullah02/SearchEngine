            "text": "C urrent discussions about infectious diseases in wildlife underscore the potential for climate warming to influence the distribution, frequency, and virulence of certain pathogens. Changes in environmental factors, including temperature and precipitation, have been linked to the geographic spread of many emerging or endemic diseases (Harvell et al. 2002; Altizer et al. 2013) . Although other anthropogenic and landscape-level changes may play an equally important role in disease dynamics in many parts of the world (Lafferty 2009) , the Arctic provides an ideal setting in which to study the effects of climate warming on host-pathogen systems, given the region's rapid rate of ecological change, relatively low levels of biodiversity, and the limited anthropogenic influence relative to tropical and temperate regions (Hoberg et al. 2008; Kutz et al. 2013) . Over the past century, temperature increases in the Arctic have been twice the global average and future warming is expected to occur more quickly and at a greater magnitude at high latitudes (Parry et al. 2007) . Arctic ecosystems face pronounced loss of sea ice, permafrost degradation, changes in hydrology, wetland drying, and related alterations in nutrient cycling (Hinzman et al. 2013) ; consequently, plant and animal communities are changing in terms of both composition and distribution (Tape et al. 2006; Post et al. 2009 ).",

Environmental pressures associated with climate warming may also affect the timing and duration of migration in some species, leading to different patterns of migratory overlap (Patterson and Guerin 2013) .

The Arctic is facing a major ecological transition that is expected to substantially affect animal and human health. Changes in phenology or environmental conditions that result from climate warming may promote novel species assemblages as host and pathogen ranges expand to previously unoccupied areas. Recent evidence from the Arctic and subarctic suggests an increase in the spread and prevalence of some wildlife diseases, but baseline data necessary to detect and verify such changes are still lacking. Wild birds are undergoing rapid shifts in distribution and have been implicated in the spread of wildlife and zoonotic diseases. Here, we review evidence of current and projected changes in the abundance and distribution of avian diseases and outline strategies for future research. We discuss relevant climatic and environmental factors, emerging host-pathogen contact zones, the relationship between host condition and immune function, and potential wildlife and human health outcomes in northern regions. nary efforts have been initiated to address these needs, research on wildlife disease in the North has largely been restricted to mammals of commercial or subsistence value. Here, we emphasize the importance of extending disease investigations to include wild birds. Because they commonly occur in mixed species aggregations and are often found in close proximity to humans and domestic animals, birds play a key role in disease ecology. Many birds are highly migratory and travel thousands of kilometers between wintering and breeding areas, providing direct links between pathogen populations on different continents. Thus, by serving as reservoirs or facilitating the transfer of pathogens through short-and long-distance movements, wild birds have been implicated in the spread of wildlife diseases and zoonotic diseases (Friend et al. 2001; Altizer et al. 2011) . A high proportion of the global populations of many bird species rely on Arctic and boreal breeding habitats, so the study of avian health in this region has important implications for avian conservation. Waterfowl and other wild birds also serve as a food resource for local circumpolar human residents.",

            "text": "The avoidance of disease has been proposed as one explanation for the energetically costly annual migrations of wild birds from tropical or temperate wintering areas to Arctic breeding grounds (Piersma 1997; Altizer et al. 2011) . Within a theoretical model of life-history tradeoffs, the relatively low abundance of pathogens or parasites at high latitudes provides an immunological release that allows animals to allocate more energy to reproduction (Piersma 1997; Buehler et al. 2010) . In turn, offspring encounter fewer immune challenges and may have greater chances of survival. It is an oversimplification to assume the Arctic is free from disease; however, cold temperatures, photoperiod extremes, and geographic isolation have restricted pathogen diversity and require specialized adaptations if disease organisms are to persist in local hosts (Hueffer et al. 2011; Hoberg et al. 2012) . For example, previous studies concluded that avian blood parasites (hematozoa) were absent or occurred only rarely in Arctic tundra ecosystems, a pattern attributed to a lack of suitable vectors and to unfavorable environmental conditions for transmission (Bennett et al. 1992) . Other parasites exhibit distinctive physiological strategies, such as freeze tolerance, that allow them to survive in Arctic settings. For instance, Trichinella nativa, an intestinal roundworm responsible for trichinosis in humans and non-human animals, overwinters at extremely cold temperatures (Hueffer et al. 2011) . The parasitic fauna of the Arctic is closely tied to its unique genetic history of episodic linkages across the Bering Land Bridge and represents a long period of host-parasite coevolution (Hoberg et al. 2012; Kutz et al. 2014) . Historical fluctuations in climate may also provide some context for understanding the evolutionary processes related to disease under a warming scenario, although environmental changes are currently occurring on a much shorter timescale (Hoberg et al. 2008) .",

However, a lack of baseline information has hindered our ability to detect and verify such changes. The limited number of avian disease studies that have been conducted in the Arctic and subarctic have targeted specific pathogens -such as avian influenza virus -or focused on diagnosis of isolated morbidity and mortality events. In contrast, there has been minimal general disease surveillance, due in part to the extreme environmental conditions, logistical constraints, and remoteness of these northern regions. As a result, much of our understanding of disease in Arctic and subarctic birds has been extrapolated from useful but limited local datasets, which cannot be generalized across broad geographic areas.",

            "text": "Due to the lack of background information on diseases in northern birds, it is often challenging to determine whether initial detection of a pathogen represents true emergence, whether it warrants concern, and whether it is pathogenic for a given host. A new geographic or host record is noteworthy but does not necessarily represent an emerging infectious disease (Hoberg et al. 2008) . For instance, the first Arctic record of the Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease was documented in seabirds in Norway, but the implications of this for human and wildlife health remain unclear (Larsson et al. 2007) . Similarly, a recent study reported evidence of Plasmodium transmission in Alaska and proposed that climate warming will lead to exposure of na\u00efve birds to new parasites (Loiseau et al. 2012 ). Yet without long-term datasets, relationships between climatic variables and disease occurrence are ambiguous and difficult to quantify. For both resident and migratory bird species, seasonal activity in the Arctic can be strongly influenced by local conditions, such as extent and depth of spring snow cover and timing of ice breakup (eg Grabowski et al. 2013 ). Shifts in breeding or migration phenology could alter the temporal overlap of hosts and pathogens and increase the potential for contact between hosts. Many bird species are experiencing range expansions due to climate warming, resulting in introduction of species to previously unoccupied areas (eg Gibson and Kessel 1992; Benson et al. 2000) . As additional habitat becomes available, through shifts in vegetation cover and longer snow-free periods, some populations of waterfowl are adapting by breeding in higher latitude areas and occasionally at greater densities (eg Flint et al. 2008) . Larger numbers of other normally migratory species such as mallard ( Figure  1 ; Anas platyrhynchos) and brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) are remaining in northern locales over winter (Ward et al. 2009; National Audubon Society 2012) . In addition to creating concentrated aggregations of birds, year-round residence may prevent the culling of diseased animals that naturally occurs on account of the energetic demands of migration (Bradley and Altizer 2005; Altizer et al. 2011; Patterson and Guerin 2013) . Several recent studies provide evidence that migratory birds serve as effective long-distance vectors of wildlife and zoonotic pathogens to the Arctic, highlighting the potential for changes in movement patterns to affect disease transmission. In 2011, Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever in humans, was detected in northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and in environmental samples from St Paul Island in the Bering Sea for the first time. Genetic sequencing identified both terrestrial and marine strains of the organism and suggested that seabirds may play an important role in its regional distribution (Duncan et al. 2013) . Similarly, in Svalbard, barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) have been identified as likely vectors for transmission of Toxoplasma gondii -the coccidian parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis -to Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), polar bears (Ursus maritimus), seals, and other marine mammals (Sandstr\u00f6m et al. 2013) . Borreliainfected ticks (the agents of Lyme disease in humans) were found on seabirds in the North Atlantic (Larsson et al. 2007 ) and on songbirds in northern Canada (Scott et al. 2012) , suggesting possible long-distance transport via avian migrants.",

As climate warming alters plant communities (eg through encroachment of shrubs into tundra habitats), conditions may become more suitable for arthropod vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks, and biting flies. Milder winters and a longer growing season are thought to have been responsible for increases in the range and abundance of ticks in Sweden (Jaenson et al. 2012) . Northward expansion of ixodid ticks has also been observed in parts of Russia and northern Canada (Kutz et al. 2009; Revich et al. 2012 ). In the Czech Republic, tick-borne encephalitis has spread to higher altitudes, a shift that is linked to climate-related changes in the distribution of the passerine birds that serve as hosts (Danielova et al. 2010) . Timing of emergence of insects, including vector species, may be influenced by warming and could influence pathogen life cycles and subsequent disease exposure (Altizer et al. 2013 ). Transmission of some pathogens is strongly associated with temperature, suggesting that vectors already present in local environments may spread disease more efficiently in areas experiencing climate warming. For example, mosquitoes (Culex spp) known to be effective vectors for West Nile virus currently extend into northern Canada and Alaska. Spread of the virus to these regions is thought to be limited by temperature (Roth et al. 2010) , so a major warming trend could promote northward expansion (Parkinson and Butler 2005) .",

Higher temperatures and a longer growing season can lead to shifts in geographic distribution or accelerated larval development among some parasites (Harvell et al. 2002; Hoberg et al. 2008 ). Such changes have been well-documented among parasites of northern ungulates, resulting in range expansion and a shortened developmental cycle for an important lung parasite of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus; Kutz et al. 2009 Kutz et al. , 2013 . Similarly, a study of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in Scotland determined that temperature and precipitation strongly influenced the rate of development and timing of transmission of parasitic nematodes (Cattadori et al. 2005) . In subarctic Fennoscandia, the emergence of epidemic disease caused by mosquito-borne filaroid nematodes has been associated with higher temperatures (Laaksonen et al. 2010) . Systematic studies have not yet been conducted in Arctic birds, but similar trends may be emerging, especially among avian species that remain resident throughout the year (Figure 3 ). In Nunavut, Canada, newly detected parasitic fleas on Ross's geese (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) have been associated with reduced reproductive success, and flea numbers are expected to increase with future climate warming (Harriman and Alisauskas 2010).",

Some helminth parasites respond favorably to a milder climate and could infect bird populations in northern regions where environmental conditions have previously been unsuitable. Conversely, in other cases, warming may actually impede parasite development (Altizer et al. 2013; Kutz et al. 2014) . Targeted sampling across physical and ecological gradients such as latitude, elevation, and habitat features will help to expose these complexities and identify unique ecological drivers of disease dynamics. Quantification of variablesincluding air, soil, and water temperatures; precipitation; vegetation structure; and hydrology -can be used to determine critical thresholds for pathogen survival and bird phenology that can then be incorporated into predictive models of future distribution for specific pathogens.",

Ecological transition zones that are undergoing rapid rates of change present new frontiers in Arctic wildlife disease research. For example, the coastline of the Arctic Ocean attracts a unique species assemblage and is changing as a result of declining sea ice, high rates of coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and rapidly increasing graminoid production (Hinzman et al. 2013; Post et al. 2013) . Animals congregate along this narrow coastal margin, creating opportunities for pathogen exchange between birds and mammals and between marine and terrestrial environments (reviewed in Post et al. 2013) . Another key ecological transition zone, the tundra-boreal interface, is experiencing a regime shift that has important implications for disease transmission. Rising temperatures, shrub encroachment, northward expansion of the tree line, and changes in hydrology may all influence vector populations in this region (Hoberg et al. 2013) . Surveillance for diseases at their known or presumed northern limits will help to establish current pat- terns of distribution and detect future changes. For pathogens that are expected to edge northward slowly rather than being introduced via large migratory movements (eg West Nile virus; Roth et al. 2010) , efforts should target subarctic regions that share connectivity with temperate zones.",

Similarly, a genetically diverse assortment of coronaviruses from migratory and resident species detected in the Beringia region between Russia and Alaska highlights the importance of wild birds as reservoirs and the potential for transmission of pathogens at mixing areas, followed by movement across large distances (Muradrasoli et al. 2010) .

However, the effects of a pathogen often vary across species and populations, potentially causing widespread mortality in one instance and little or www.frontiersinecology.org \u00a9 The Ecological Society of America no demographic impact in another. Therefore, measurement of the specific fitness consequences of pathogens on their wildlife hosts is an important area for future research. Well-studied populations with known demographic parameters (eg age, reproductive history, movement patterns) may provide useful model systems for tracking subtle changes in individual health status that negatively affect reproduction and survival. The outcomes of disease outbreaks on wild bird populations have important implications not only for avian conservation but also for other wildlife and for humans who rely on these resources. Human-wildlife interactions are common in the Arctic and the occurrence of zoonotic diseases in harvested birds, mammals, or fish may pose a threat to human health or present risks to food security (Parkinson and Butler 2005; Jenkins et al. 2013; Hueffer et al. 2013) . Zoonotic pathogens -including Toxoplasma, Trichinella, Echinococcus, and Giardiathat have been detected in Arctic or subarctic wildlife species affect a wide range of organisms (Kutz et al. 2008; Hueffer et al. 2013; Jenkins et al. 2013; Sandstr\u00f6m et al. 2013; Schurer et al. 2014) . Birds have been implicated in the spread of many infectious diseases to other wildlife and to humans, but more research is needed to identify the mechanisms and scale of pathogen transport. Future studies could help to address such information gaps by sampling across migratory flyways and in birds and mammals that overlap spatially.",

Incorporating pathogen screening into existing avian monitoring programs offers an efficient means of collecting important baseline information. In the future, longitudinal sampling that includes archiving of blood or other tissues will help in detecting changes in animal health related to climate-driven ecological shifts; retrospective analyses of historical samples, where available, can be used to identify changes that have already occurred. Given the prevalence of subsistence hunting and strong human connections to the environment in many northern communities, local residents are also an important source of information and can often provide early detection of changes in the health of wildlife species (Figure 3 ; Hoberg et al. 2008 Hoberg et al. , 2013 Kutz et al. 2009 ). Including hunter-harvested animals in research efforts can also help to maximize sample collection and complement community-based education programs about potential threats to traditional subsistence foods.",
