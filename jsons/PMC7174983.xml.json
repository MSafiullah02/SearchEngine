            "text": "The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-Cov-2 or COVID-19 has become a worldwide threat and healthcare concern. Human to human transmission of the virus occurs through respiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) and through direct contact with an infected patient or indirect contact with fomites in his environment (Li et al., 2020a; Ong et al., 2020). Since its outbreak in China at the end of 2019 and until the 5th of April 2020, the pandemic has affected more than a million of people and caused 62,773 deaths globally (20200405-sitrep-76-covid-19.pdf, 2020). It is thought that patients with comorbid conditions are more susceptible to manifest complications of the viral infection (Guan et al., 2020a). According to a recently published Chinese cohort, patients with cancer had a higher risk of developing severe events (intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, or death) compared with patients without cancer (39 % vs 8%, p = 0\u00b70003) (Liang et al., 2020). Moreover, public health measures that are implemented in order to control the disease spread aim to decrease preventable hospital admissions and elective procedures (Cao et al., 2020). However, cancer patients need continuous care, and undergoing diagnostic tests or therapeutic interventions is not a luxury, whereas their potential COVID-19 exposure could be very risky, or even fatal. Remarkable efforts are made to understand the particularity of cancer patients who contract the novel coronavirus, to overcome the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and to implement recommendations to protect this vulnerable population from the virus exposure as well as from the disease progression resulting from testing and treatment delays. In this article, epidemiological, radiological and clinical features of adult cancer patients with COVID-19 will be reviewed based on an extensive review of the literature, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies suggested by healthcare providers and institutions in endemics areas, particularly China and Italy.",

Those measures also apply to cancer research centers that found their activity declining due to quarantining measure, working in shifts and lacking supplies. Thus, researchers faced the necessity to make decisions on continuing or interrupting trials (COVID-19 Challenges Basic Researchers, 2020). While experimental researches are crucial for providing the best care for cancer patients, many centers are trying to make changes to their programs and adapt to the new situation without interrupting their activity. Moreover, high authorities such as the FDA issued guidelines that recommend being more flexible about protocols. Some measure were taken from remoting communication with patients for follow up, making changes and exceptions to trials protocols to reducing multiple hospital visits and routine follow up, postponing new clinical trials, etc. (Clinical Research Slows as COVID-19 Surges, 2020).",

These conclusions were compatible with those of the prospective cohort of Liang et al. Moreover, both studies implied that hospital admission was an independent risk factor to acquire a SARS-CoV-2 infection, because most of cancer patients in the first study were receiving active in-hospital treatments (chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery), and 8 of 28 patients (28.6 %) in the second study were suspected to have a hospital-associated transmission.",

Qu et al. reported the case of one patient with lung adenocarcinoma who had a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection with diffuse, irregular, small ground-glass opacities with partial consolidation on day 10 of infection on chest CT-scan. This is not compatible with the typical peripheral subpleural ground-glass infiltrates (Qu et al., 2020).\u2022Cancer patients might have radiographic findings similar to those of a SAR-CoV-2 infection and can be misleading. A Chinese article reported the cases of five of 139 cancer patients who had ground-glass opacities on baseline chest CT-scans. Three of these patients underwent RT-PCR, had a negative test and were considered negative for COVID-19. The most retained diagnosis in these patients was another viral infection (Zhu et al., 2020). Nevertheless, many sources now admit that radiographic findings are more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 (Fang et al., 2020) and the previously reported cases could have a COVID-19 infection that was missed because of a false negative PCR test.\u2022Due to the high frequency of routine chest imaging in the follow up of cancer patients, incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 may not be infrequent. These findings are a source of frustration for the patient and the physician, as they may suggest either another differential diagnosis or a COVID-19 infection at an early asymptomatic stage especially in regions of high disease prevalence as was the case of an Italian patient who was referred for an FDG-PET/CT (Polverari et al., 2020). This was then highlighted by an Italian analysis performed in a nuclear medicine center where incidental findings were recorded in 7 of 65 asymptomatic patients who underwent imaging studies, of whom 5 had a laboratory confirmed infection (Albano et al., 2020).\u2022Due to similarity in symptoms between the infection and the underlying disease, especially in lung cancer patients and patients with pulmonary metastasis, the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be delayed. In two patients who were programmed for elective lobectomy for early stage lung cancer in China, a retrospective diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was made after patients worsened their symptoms post-operatively. The examination of pulmonary pathology showed that inflammatory changes consistent with interstitial disease were present at the time of surgery (Tian et al., 2020).\u2022Some clinical and biological features can mask a COVID-19 presentation in cancer patients. This is the case of hematologic malignancies where laboratory results can be misleading. For instance, a Chinese patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL treated with chlorambucil presented with signs of disease progression as well as respiratory symptoms. She initially denied any exposure to a confirmed case, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was delayed because of the high white blood counts count (91\u00b785 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and the focus on the treatment of his underlying malignancy (Jin et al., 2020).\n",

Most of the cases who died were elderly patients (median age 75; range 48\u201089 years) and had comorbidities or a history of recent surgery. Of the 17 deaths, only one patient had a history of cancer. He was an 86-year-old man with a history of colon cancer and underwent a colon cancer surgery (Wang et al., 2020b). Of course, this small sample prevents us from extrapolating these data; however, this patient had other comorbid conditions (hypertension and diabetes mellitus) that, along with his age and male gender make him more vulnerable to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact, a nationwide analysis of 1590 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in 575 Chinese hospitals between December 11th, 2019 and January 31 st, 2020 showed that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (16.9 %) and diabetes (8.2 %). Only 18 patients (1.1 %) had a history on malignancy. However, severe cases in this analysis were more likely to have a malignancy (50.0 % versus 15.6 %) compared with non-severe cases. The composite endpoints consisting of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death were also analyzed, and after adjustment for age and smoking status a history of malignancy was the fourth most common risk factor of reaching the composite endpoints with a HR of 3.50 (95 %CI 1.60\u20137.64) (Guan et al., 2020a). On the other hand, in the 1099 patients cohort of Wei-Gie Guan et al. previously mentioned, out of 10 patients who had cancer only one patient experienced an adverse event (ICU admission, ventilation or death) (Guan et al., 2020b). This may suggest that adverse outcomes in malignancy are not as frequent as we think. Moreover, an analysis of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in China showed that 58 had comorbidities, of whom 7% had a cancer history while 60 % had hypertension or diabetes mellitus (Du et al., 2020).",

Telephone screening of patients for any suspicious symptom before admission for elective procedures is also recommended by a group of practitioners, with a low threshold for undergoing nasopharyngeal swabs before surgery (Simonato et al., 2020). In gastroenterology, a change in practice was also witnessed (Pellino and Spinelli, 2020). For instance, in colorectal surgery, most elective procedures were limited in many centers over the country, but colorectal cancer surgeries were not part of this strategy and were maintained along with emergent procedures (Lisi et al., 2020; Di Saverio et al., 2020). Some practitioners in rectal cancer opted, in the absence of recommendations to substitute oral capecitabine for 5-FU whenever possible, and to adopt short course radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting with delaying surgical interventions (De Felice and Petrucciani, 2020).",

Note that similar suggestions were proposed by a multinational group of practitioners (Ramirez et al., 2020).\u2022In urological practice, a scheme of therapeutic options was proposed by a group of experts (Fizazi and pour les membres du bureau du Groupe d\u2019\u00e9tude des tumeurs uro-g\u00e9nitales, 2020) that meet the proposed guidelines of the CCAFU (Comit\u00e9 de Canc\u00e9rologie de l\u2019Association Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Urologie (Mejean et al., 2020): maintain treatment of every curable disease with possible delay of surgery for very small stable renal tumors, encourage active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer, privilege neoadjuvant hormone therapy with differed radiotherapy for intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer over surgery, discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable bladder cancer and choose less toxic chemotherapy with use of G-CSF to avoid neutropenia. As for advanced disease, those recommendations agree on minimizing the risk of immunosuppression by avoiding corticosteroids for prostate cancer, substituting highly myelotoxic protocols with fewer toxic ones (gemzar-cisplatin instead of MVAC) with G-CSF use. However, the safety of immunotherapy for renal and urothelial carcinomas remains controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.\u2022In sarcoma, The French Sarcoma group issued recommendations that encourage maintaining neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for all patients who are not suspected to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and advise to ensure post-operative resuscitation capacities for high risk surgeries (Penel et al., 2020).\n",

            "text": "Recently, a huge effort was made by various oncology societies and national authorities to implement recommendations that help practitioners in decision making on cancer care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An international collaborative group reviewed the challenges encountered in cancer care and proposed some practical measures for the management of cancer patients based on the available data on the 26th of March (Al-Shamsi et al., 2020). International guidelines were issued with common general principles, and few particularities that emerge from every society\u2019s experience (Burki, 2020b). \u2022In hematology, researchers are most interested in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, first because of a higher risk of infection in neutropenic patients, and second because of the risk carried by stem cells donation, transportation and preservation as well as the difficulty to find donors with travel bans (Szer et al., 2020; Dholaria and Savani, 2020). A reported case of a Chinese patient who was treated with Cyclosporine A seven months following a bone marrow transplantation for AML and who died after acquiring a COVID-19 infection despite getting adequate care suggests that physicians should rethink the transplantation practice during the pandemic. The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation EBMT issued recommendations to protect patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. They consist of differing transplantation for confirmed cases at least 3 months for low risk disease or until recovery for high risk disease. Symptomatic patients should be screened with multiplex PCR (with or without COVID-19 RT-PCR) and the intervention should be differed if possible. Deferral also applies for patients who have close contact with a positive case (and is strongly recommended for low risk patients) and COVID-19 PCR should be drawn in this case. Patients traveling from an endemic region should be isolated and have their intervention differed for 14\u201321 days especially in low risk disease. As for donors, those who have a confirmed infection with COVID-19 must be excluded from donation. Those who were close contacts with a positive patient or who are travelling from an endemic zone have to be excluded for 21\u201328 days and isolated with close monitoring of symptoms (EBMT, 2020).\u2022In breast cancer, guidelines on radiation therapy were issued by an international group of practitioners (Coles et al., 2020) and insisted on the following: oAvoiding radiotherapy for patients 65 years or older with invasive breast cancer without adverse features who are planned for hormone therapy.oDelivering only 5 fractions for patients with node negative tumors that do not require a boost.oConsidering omitting nodal radiotherapy in post-menopausal women who require whole breast radiotherapy following sentinel lymph node biopsy and primary surgery without adverse pathological features.oPrivileging moderate hypofractionation for all breast/chest wall and nodal radiotherapy.\n\u2022Finally, Masumi Ueda et al published their recommendations in the Journal of National Comprehensive Care Network (JNCCN) on cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis based on their experience in three institutions at the epicenter of the disease in the United States. They focused on the following (Ueda et al., 2020):oReinforcing the environmental control for an effective triage of patients by forming a multidisciplinary \u201cincident command structure\u201d in cancer centers.oExpanding telemedicine for outpatient care.oMaintaining adjuvant therapy with curative intent for solid tumors.oConsidering maintaining therapy for metastatic disease to minimize hospital admission for symptom palliation.oPrioritizing surgical interventions for cancer patients based on the rapidity of disease evolution.oLimiting enrollment in clinical trials to patients who are most likely to benefit from it.oDiscussing palliative care and end-of-life for COVID-19 positive patients with advanced cancer to limit unnecessary ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation.oProviding emotional and physical support for healthcare workers, as well as protective measures for those of them who have chronic conditions that predispose them to the complications of the COVID-19 infection.\n\n",

The approach of cancer patients must be dynamic and tailored to every patient\u2019s condition, every hospital\u2019s resources and every physician\u2019s experience. Oncologists must keep in mind that beyond any scientific speculations, if the COVID-19 outbreak extends, the risk of unavailability of high-level care in oncology would be greater than that of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cancer patient.",
