            "text": "Before evaluation in human volunteer or patient clinical studies, all investigational medicinal products (IMPs, e.g. pharmaceuticals including biotechnology derived products, gene therapies and vaccines) require evaluation in nonclinical toxicology and safety studies, generally in a rodent and a non-rodent (\u2018second\u2019) species; (ICH-Topic-M3(R2), 2009). These nonclinical toxicology and safety studies allow a risk assessment to be performed to act as a safeguard for human subjects. The use of a non-rodent species in addition to a rodent species aims at limiting the uncertainty in the extrapolation process from animal toxicity and safety data to the human situation. Dogs, and in specific circumstances minipigs, are the more frequently used non-rodent species (ICH-Topic-M3(R2), 2009). However, when it is scientifically justified that these are inappropriate, regulatory authorities worldwide accept the use of non-human primates. Non-human primates are also used when they represent a well-established model of a compound class or when they are the relevant species (especially for biotechnology-derived products) for detecting known side effects or upon specific recommendations from regulatory authorities. \u201cNew World monkeys\u201d such as Callithrix jacchus (the common marmoset) and the larger \u201cOld World monkeys\u201d such as Macaca Fascicularis (cynomolgus monkeys) and Macaca Mulatta (rhesus monkeys) are typically used (Weatherall, 2006, SCHER, 2009). This paper provides a general overview of the marmoset as model in nonclinical development of pharmaceutical products taking into account the recent regulatory changes in husbandry, new micro sampling technologies, the requirements for reducing primate use alongside the contrasting need for relevant species selection in biotechnology derived product development.",

            "text": "The marmoset is a relatively small animal, approximately the size of an adult rat (up to 500 g; Table 1\n). Their small size has several advantages during the early phases of IMP development, as material production is usually sub-optimal and therefore sufficient quantities can be rate limiting for studies. Since the amount of material required is roughly proportional to the size of the animals there are significant savings, both in cost and time, in the use of smaller species such as marmosets. The reduction in material requirement has been estimated to be 10\u201315-fold when comparing a 500 g marmoset to a \u223c5\u201310 kg macaque (Weatherall, 2006, Zuhlke and Weinbauer, 2003, Smith et al., 2001). Shorter synthesis time offers the potential for earlier administration to human subjects which in turn may lead to substantial cost savings (estimates range from 12 to 18 months\u2019 reduction in development time). The reduction in the amount of material required for early development studies may also have a corresponding benefit in allowing more time for large scale synthesis optimization, with further opportunities for benefit in time and costs later in development (Smith et al., 2001). The marmoset also requires smaller cages than those for larger non-human primates and many methodologies and technologies used for the rat can also be used for the marmoset such as metabolic cages.",

The marmoset has a high reproductive efficiency, typically producing twins twice a year with sexual maturity reached within 18 months of age (compared to approximately 4 years for \u201cOld World monkeys\u201d). This aspect is particularly important, as the issue of toxicity studies conducted in non-rodent species where the animals are not sexually mature has been of considerable concern. The high reproductive efficiency also allows for the rapid establishment of an in-house breeding colony, with easier availability of animals and more reliable results due to reduced stress from transportation and colony alterations. A secondary benefit is a reduction in overall cost. Furthermore, the life cycle of the marmoset is physiologically faster (7\u201320 years) than that of the \u201cOld World monkeys\u201d resulting in greater availability of aged animals, an important aspect for studies involving aging and bone disease.",

The cages should be equipped with wooden bars and hiding provisions and should take into account that marmosets are used to an arboreal habitat. It is important to provide a certain degree of variability in orientation, diameter and firmness to allow the animals to perform appropriate locomotor and jumping behaviors (Weatherall, 2006, OJ-L-197-(vol-50), 2007) (Fig. 1\nand Fig. 2\n).\u2022Marmosets frequently scent-mark their environment and the total removal of familiar scent may cause behavioral problems. Alternate cleaning and sanitation of the enclosure and the enrichment devices retains some of the territorial scent-marking. Regular handling and human contact are beneficial for improving the animals\u2019 habituation to monitoring and experimental conditions and facilitate training to co-operate with some procedures.\u2022Since the marmosets originate from tropical rain forests, they should be kept at a relatively high temperature of 23\u201328 \u00b0C with a relative humidity of between 45 and 70%. A light and dark cycle of 12 h is recommended. The lighting source should illuminate uniformly the holding room.

Blood samples are usually taken from the femoral vein, although the tail vein can be used for very small toxicokinetic samples. Typically only 15% of the circulating blood volume can be removed within one month, requiring more sensitive analytical methods to be developed for a small sample size, similar to that for rodents (Smith et al., 2001, Zuhlke and Weinbauer, 2003), consequently the marmosets\u2019 small size does not pose a problem if analytical methodologies are already in place for rodents.

Intravenous dosing is commonly performed using the saphenous vein (although some laboratories have successfully employed the cephalic vein). With experienced technicians, daily intravenous dosing can be performed relatively easily as well as continuous intravenous infusion (Ruiz de Elvira and Abbott, 1986) and repeated intravenous dosing, the latter using subcutaneously implanted vascular access ports (Smith et al., 2001, Zuhlke and Weinbauer, 2003). Intramuscular injections are usually given in the thigh muscle while subcutaneous injections are made into the upper back or abdomen in combination with lightweight backpack systems (Smith et al., 2001, Zuhlke and Weinbauer, 2003). Dietary administration of non-palatable products and inhalation are the only dosing methods that present challenges. For inhalation studies it is possible to provide masks for the marmoset in a similar fashion to those used for macaques; however, their small size makes this more difficult. A one month repeated inhalation study has been described using whole body exposure where the animals were exposed for 6 h per day to a vapor (Kurata et al., 1997).",

The marmoset is a recognized model of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Owen et al., 1997) using selective neurotoxins to destroy the dopamine neurons. The toxins most commonly used are 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). More recently, transgenic models of the disorder have been developed in marmosets leading to over-expression of proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein using viral vectors (Kirik et al., 2003, Eslamboli et al., 2007). The experimental use of marmosets is an important intermediary step between rodent studies and controlled clinical trials when the phylogenetic similarity to humans is pivotal for assessing and optimizing the efficacy of candidate therapies. However, the marmoset is not the most suitable non-human primate species to use when specific behavioral tests are required (e.g. cognitive testing, tremor rating) (Eslamboli, 2005).",

Historically, the former have dominated the field of HD research (Ramaswamy et al., 2007). The unilateral QA putamen lesion in the marmoset provides a useful and recognized tool for the investigation of potential treatments (Kendall et al., 1998), however this model does not replicate the pathology or the symptoms of HD but rather develops a consistently reproducible lesion with motor impairments (Kendall et al., 1998, Kendall et al., 2000a, Kendall et al., 2000b). Recently the marmoset huntingtin (Htt) gene has been isolated and identified, resulting in the potential to prepare a transgenic HD marmoset model, that could provide further information on the underlying pathology and the ability to test therapeutic candidates and gene therapies (Hohjoh et al., 2009, Ramaswamy et al., 2007).",

The large number of products glucuronidated, whether directly or following the Phase I step, necessitates a thorough understanding of glucuronidation for efficient pharmaceutical development (Dutton, 1980). Typically, rodents are used as the primary animal model and the dog commonly used as the second animal model for pharmacokinetic studies. However a wide range of products are more extensively glucuronidated by dog liver microsomes when compared with human hepatic microsomes (Soars et al., 2001). Furthermore, qualitative differences in glucurondation are observed between dogs and humans with extrahepatic glucuronidation being markedly reduced in dogs (Soars et al., 2001). By contrast, there are quantitative and qualitative similarities between human and marmoset glucuronidation in vitro and as such the marmoset is a useful model especially when the rate and pathway of glucuronidation of a medicine are known to differ significantly between rodents, dogs and humans (Soars et al., 2001). The significant extrahepatic (e.g. kidney) glucuronidation observed in marmosets in comparison with other animals merits its use for preclinical pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation studies. Nevertheless, further work should also be performed to confirm that observations in different species in vitro accurately represent the situation in vivo (Soars et al., 2001).",

These factors, alongside a better understanding of their optimal nutrient and welfare requirements over recent years, facilitate the generation of a more cohesive and robust dataset. With the growth of biotechnology-derived products and gene therapies, the use of non-human primates has, by necessity, also increased since these are often the only relevant species that provide an adequate safety assessment. Nevertheless, there is a growing public call for minimizing their use now and in the future. Utilizing, the more primitive marmoset species may provide the optimal compromise.",
