            "text": "The avoidance of disease has been proposed as one explanation for the energetically costly annual migrations of wild birds from tropical or temperate wintering areas to Arctic breeding grounds (Piersma 1997; Altizer et al. 2011). Within a theoretical model of life\u2010history tradeoffs, the relatively low abundance of pathogens or parasites at high latitudes provides an immunological release that allows animals to allocate more energy to reproduction (Piersma 1997; Buehler et al. 2010). In turn, offspring encounter fewer immune challenges and may have greater chances of survival. It is an oversimplification to assume the Arctic is free from disease; however, cold temperatures, photoperiod extremes, and geographic isolation have restricted pathogen diversity and require specialized adaptations if disease organisms are to persist in local hosts (Hueffer et al. 2011; Hoberg et al. 2012). For example, previous studies concluded that avian blood parasites (hematozoa) were absent or occurred only rarely in Arctic tundra ecosystems, a pattern attributed to a lack of suitable vectors and to unfavorable environmental conditions for transmission (Bennett et al. 1992). Other parasites exhibit distinctive physiological strategies, such as freeze tolerance, that allow them to survive in Arctic settings. For instance, Trichinella nativa, an intestinal roundworm responsible for trichinosis in humans and non\u2010human animals, overwinters at extremely cold temperatures (Hueffer et al. 2011). The parasitic fauna of the Arctic is closely tied to its unique genetic history of episodic linkages across the Bering Land Bridge and represents a long period of host\u2013parasite coevolution (Hoberg et al. 2012; Kutz et al. 2014). Historical fluctuations in climate may also provide some context for understanding the evolutionary processes related to disease under a warming scenario, although environmental changes are currently occurring on a much shorter timescale (Hoberg et al. 2008).",

Some of the most marked declines in wild populations were the result of infectious diseases that spread rapidly through na\u00efve populations (Harvell et al. 2002; Frick et al. 2010; LaPointe et al. 2012). A wide range of pathogens have been implicated in such disease outbreaks, but they share one feature in common: after introduction or emergence, each experienced range expansion that resulted in high mortality of susceptible hosts. A similar scenario could emerge among Arctic birds and other wildlife exposed to new disease threats in areas undergoing climate\u2010driven environmental changes.",

However, a lack of baseline information has hindered our ability to detect and verify such changes. The limited number of avian disease studies that have been conducted in the Arctic and subarctic have targeted specific pathogens \u2013 such as avian influenza virus \u2013 or focused on diagnosis of isolated morbidity and mortality events. In contrast, there has been minimal general disease surveillance, due in part to the extreme environmental conditions, logistical constraints, and remoteness of these northern regions. As a result, much of our understanding of disease in Arctic and subarctic birds has been extrapolated from useful but limited local datasets, which cannot be generalized across broad geographic areas.",

A new geographic or host record is noteworthy but does not necessarily represent an emerging infectious disease (Hoberg et al. 2008). For instance, the first Arctic record of the Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease was documented in seabirds in Norway, but the implications of this for human and wildlife health remain unclear (Larsson et al. 2007). Similarly, a recent study reported evidence of Plasmodium transmission in Alaska and proposed that climate warming will lead to exposure of na\u00efve birds to new parasites (Loiseau et al. 2012).

For both resident and migratory bird species, seasonal activity in the Arctic can be strongly influenced by local conditions, such as extent and depth of spring snow cover and timing of ice breakup (eg Grabowski et al. 2013). Shifts in breeding or migration phenology could alter the temporal overlap of hosts and pathogens and increase the potential for contact between hosts. Many bird species are experiencing range expansions due to climate warming, resulting in introduction of species to previously unoccupied areas (eg Gibson and Kessel 1992; Benson et al. 2000). As additional habitat becomes available, through shifts in vegetation cover and longer snow\u2010free periods, some populations of waterfowl are adapting by breeding in higher latitude areas and occasionally at greater densities (eg Flint et al. 2008). Larger numbers of other normally migratory species such as mallard (Figure 1; Anas platyrhynchos) and brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) are remaining in northern locales over winter (Ward et al. 2009; National Audubon Society 2012). In addition to creating concentrated aggregations of birds, year\u2010round residence may prevent the culling of diseased animals that naturally occurs on account of the energetic demands of migration (Bradley and Altizer 2005; Altizer et al. 2011; Patterson and Guerin 2013).",

In 2011, Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever in humans, was detected in northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and in environmental samples from St Paul Island in the Bering Sea for the first time. Genetic sequencing identified both terrestrial and marine strains of the organism and suggested that seabirds may play an important role in its regional distribution (Duncan et al. 2013). Similarly, in Svalbard, barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and pink\u2010footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) have been identified as likely vectors for transmission of Toxoplasma gondii \u2013 the coccidian parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis \u2013 to Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), polar bears (Ursus maritimus), seals, and other marine mammals (Sandstr\u00f6m et al. 2013).

Along the Arctic coastline, increasing overlap between marine and terrestrial habitats due to loss of sea ice is leading to novel assemblages of bird and mammal species (Post et al. 2013). Polar bears, for example, are being seen more frequently on land during the peak of the summer breeding season for migratory birds. Consequently, the bears have more interactions with birds, sometimes preying on adults, chicks, and eggs (eg Iles et al. 2013) and sharing foraging habitat and food resources (Figure 2).",

Limited foraging opportunities and increased anthropogenic activities may lead to dense aggregations of animals at concentrated food sources. For instance, resident and migratory birds, polar bears, brown bears (Ursus arctos), and red (Vulpes vulpes) and Arctic foxes congregate at garbage dumps and at bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) carcasses remaining after subsistence hunts in northern communities (Figure 2). Birds provide a key link between marine and terrestrial environments and may facilitate cross\u2010species transmission of pathogens, such as avian influenza viruses that spread among coastal congregations of wildlife, sometimes causing illness or mortality in alternate hosts (Krauss et al. 2010; Anthony et al. 2012).",

As climate warming alters plant communities (eg through encroachment of shrubs into tundra habitats), conditions may become more suitable for arthropod vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks, and biting flies. Milder winters and a longer growing season are thought to have been responsible for increases in the range and abundance of ticks in Sweden (Jaenson et al. 2012). Northward expansion of ixodid ticks has also been observed in parts of Russia and northern Canada (Kutz et al. 2009; Revich et al. 2012). In the Czech Republic, tick\u2010borne encephalitis has spread to higher altitudes, a shift that is linked to climate\u2010related changes in the distribution of the passerine birds that serve as hosts (Danielova et al. 2010). Timing of emergence of insects, including vector species, may be influenced by warming and could influence pathogen life cycles and subsequent disease exposure (Altizer et al. 2013). Transmission of some pathogens is strongly associated with temperature, suggesting that vectors already present in local environments may spread disease more efficiently in areas experiencing climate warming. For example, mosquitoes (Culex spp) known to be effective vectors for West Nile virus currently extend into northern Canada and Alaska. Spread of the virus to these regions is thought to be limited by temperature (Roth et al. 2010), so a major warming trend could promote northward expansion (Parkinson and Butler 2005).",

Higher temperatures and a longer growing season can lead to shifts in geographic distribution or accelerated larval development among some parasites (Harvell et al. 2002; Hoberg et al. 2008). Such changes have been well\u2010documented among parasites of northern ungulates, resulting in range expansion and a shortened developmental cycle for an important lung parasite of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus; Kutz et al. 2009, 2013). Similarly, a study of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in Scotland determined that temperature and precipitation strongly influenced the rate of development and timing of transmission of parasitic nematodes (Cattadori et al. 2005). In subarctic Fennoscandia, the emergence of epidemic disease caused by mosquito\u2010borne filaroid nematodes has been associated with higher temperatures (Laaksonen et al. 2010). Systematic studies have not yet been conducted in Arctic birds, but similar trends may be emerging, especially among avian species that remain resident throughout the year (Figure 3). In Nunavut, Canada, newly detected parasitic fleas on Ross's geese (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) have been associated with reduced reproductive success, and flea numbers are expected to increase with future climate warming (Harriman and Alisauskas 2010).",

Parasites with a free\u2010living stage and vector\u2010borne pathogens are especially responsive to temperature fluctuations and therefore provide useful models for the study of climate\u2013pathogen interactions. The prevalence and distribution of avian blood parasites (Figure 5) \u2013 for which blackflies, biting midges, and mosquitoes serve as vectors \u2013 are projected to expand in response to warmer temperatures and vegetation changes in Arctic tundra areas (Loiseau et al. 2012; Altizer et al. 2013). Some helminth parasites respond favorably to a milder climate and could infect bird populations in northern regions where environmental conditions have previously been unsuitable. Conversely, in other cases, warming may actually impede parasite development (Altizer et al. 2013; Kutz et al. 2014). Targeted sampling across physical and ecological gradients such as latitude, elevation, and habitat features will help to expose these complexities and identify unique ecological drivers of disease dynamics. Quantification of variables \u2013including air, soil, and water temperatures; precipitation; vegetation structure; and hydrology \u2013 can be used to determine critical thresholds for pathogen survival and bird phenology that can then be incorporated into predictive models of future distribution for specific pathogens.",

Ecological transition zones that are undergoing rapid rates of change present new frontiers in Arctic wildlife disease research. For example, the coastline of the Arctic Ocean attracts a unique species assemblage and is changing as a result of declining sea ice, high rates of coastal erosion, tidal inundation, and rapidly increasing graminoid production (Hinzman et al. 2013; Post et al. 2013). Animals congregate along this narrow coastal margin, creating opportunities for pathogen exchange between birds and mammals and between marine and terrestrial environments (reviewed in Post et al. 2013). Another key ecological transition zone, the tundra\u2013boreal interface, is experiencing a regime shift that has important implications for disease transmission. Rising temperatures, shrub encroachment, northward expansion of the tree line, and changes in hydrology may all influence vector populations in this region (Hoberg et al. 2013). Surveillance for diseases at their known or presumed northern limits will help to establish current patterns of distribution and detect future changes. For pathogens that are expected to edge northward slowly rather than being introduced via large migratory movements (eg West Nile virus; Roth et al. 2010), efforts should target subarctic regions that share connectivity with temperate zones.",

Similarly, a genetically diverse assortment of coronaviruses from migratory and resident species detected in the Beringia region between Russia and Alaska highlights the importance of wild birds as reservoirs and the potential for transmission of pathogens at mixing areas, followed by movement across large distances (Muradrasoli et al. 2010). Summer breeding and stopover sites will be subject to changes in bird density and species composition due to altered migration patterns associated with climate warming, creating additional opportunities for pathogen exchange and dispersal.

Incorporating pathogen screening into existing avian monitoring programs offers an efficient means of collecting important baseline information. In the future, longitudinal sampling that includes archiving of blood or other tissues will help in detecting changes in animal health related to climate\u2010driven ecological shifts; retrospective analyses of historical samples, where available, can be used to identify changes that have already occurred. Given the prevalence of subsistence hunting and strong human connections to the environment in many northern communities, local residents are also an important source of information and can often provide early detection of changes in the health of wildlife species (Figure 3; Hoberg et al. 2008, 2013; Kutz et al. 2009). Including hunter\u2010harvested animals in research efforts can also help to maximize sample collection and complement community\u2010based education programs about potential threats to traditional subsistence foods.",
