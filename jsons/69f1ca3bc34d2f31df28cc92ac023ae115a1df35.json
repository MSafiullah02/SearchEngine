It builds on classic ethical structures and adapts them to the equitable distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to clinicians at risk of contracting novel corona virus-19 . The article also defines systems of allocation that are generally considered unethical and are to be avoided. We emphasize that policies must be transparent, collaborative, applied equally, and have a system of accountability. It is recognized that unless the supply of PPE is quickly replenished, or viable alternatives to traditional equipment are devised in the coming days to weeks, hospitals and healthcare systems will face the difficult task of rationing PPE to at-risk clinicians. This paper suggests an ethical framework for that process. (J Am Coll Surg 2020;-:1e3.",

First, these are extreme measures intended to be implemented only in the worst-case scenario, in which adequate PPE is not available and patients must be treated.

Second, procedural justice is of utmost importance. If leaders fail to provide guidance and establish policy, leaving clinicians to fend for themselves, the moral residue will linger long after the pandemic has abated. 6 The default first-come, first-served approach is not ethically acceptable.

This standard would favor protecting those clinicians whose work could save the most patients from suffering and death, giving PPE preferentially to clinicians whose temporary or permanent absence from clinical practice due to infection with COVID-19 would harm the greatest number of patients. When distributing limited resources, such as PPE, to clinicians during a pandemic, an egalitarian approach that treats all clinical roles as equal may not serve the ultimate goal of achieving the most good for the greatest number of patients. Some clinicians are better poised to save more patients than other clinicians. This utilitarian principle would favor protecting those clinicians who are best able to save the most patients. This does not necessarily mean offering no protection to other clinicians, but instead, offering alternative or unproven methods of protection.",

Applied to PPE, social worth would require assessment not of how many lives a clinician could save, but the instrumental value of that clinician in providing patient care, both during and after the pandemic.
