Traditionally these findings are most indicative of prerenal states, but may also be found with glomerulonephritis and even certain forms of ATN.

It attempts to calculate baseline kidney function from pre-hospitalization serum creatinine values, and simultaneously recalculates baseline to determine AKI based upon the aforementioned KDIGO criteria.

When there were no prior serum creatinine records, we used the serum creatinine on the day of admission as the baseline serum creatinine, with subsequent baseline recalculated with each new serum creatinine according to a pre-defined algorithm (Supplementary Figure S1 ). As only 15% of patients had pre-hospital baseline serum creatinine measurements available, the baseline was retrospectively adjusted to the median serum creatinine value from the entirety of the hospitalization (this value was chosen, rather than the nadir or final creatinine to provide a more conservative estimate to adjudicate AKI). A ratio of greater than 1.5 from peak to median was classified as AKI. Any patient requiring RRT, regardless of automated AKI stage reporting, was defined as stage 3 AKI, as per KDIGO criteria. We did not use the urine output criteria to define AKI as the documentation of urine output in the EHR was unreliable.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many additional ICUs were created in non-traditional hospital areas and units. Hence, ICU stay was defined as either one of the following: need for invasive mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressor or inotrope support, under the care of an ICU service, or in a known ICU location.We performed descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous measures, medians and interquartile ranges for skewed continuous measures, and proportions for categorical measures. We compared baseline patient characteristics between patients with or without AKI using Fishers' exact tests for categorical variables, and nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test for continuous variables. To compare the clinical characteristics of patients across different stages of AKI, we performed Kruskal Wallis test. To identify risk factors associated with the development of AKI, we performed a logistic regression model, with adjustment for risk factors that differed between those who developed AKI and those who did not.
