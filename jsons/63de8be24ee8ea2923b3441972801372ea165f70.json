Physicians and parents of asthmatic children have long suspected that asthmatics are more prone to respiratory infections. However, these questions cannot be answered on the basis of information available in the literature because, to our Abbreviation used SRI: symptomatic respiratory infection knowledge, a longitudinal study of asthmatic children has not been conducted with an adequately controlled population of nonasthmatic children. Such a study should be performed on two populations which are exposed to the same respiratory pathogens.",

J. O. and M. C.). These children had no histories of asthma precipitated by food allergy, house dust, or pets but some of them were susceptible to asthma induced by pollens and molds during the summer. The control group was composed of nine of their brothers and six sisters, ages 4-9 yr (average, 5.7), with no histories of asthma or pulmonary signs of wheezing. Each asthmatic child had a normal sibling who was included in the study. Two of the asthmatics were brothers and only one control was included for them. Surveillance data and samples for microbiologic analysis were collected between Oct. 26, 1971, and May 25, 1972 . The health of each child was surveyed daily by the mother, two to three times weekly by a visiting registered nurse, and periodically by a physician. Respiratory infections were classified as asymptomatic, mild (signs or symptoms confined to a limited area of the respiratory system, i.e., cough, rhinitis/rhinorrhea, or pharyngitis/sore throat), or severe (involved more than one area of the respiratory system, e.g., cough and rhinorrhea, or mild infection accompanied by fever).* An episode of infection was defined as )1 day in duration and separated from adjacent episodes by ) 4 days. 2 Any evidence of shedding of viruses was interpreted as an infection. Supposition for establishing the presence of bacterial infection was based on finding a potential pathogen which was not part of the individual's normal flora. These episodes invariably consisted of the shedding of large numbers (~>50 at peak of shedding) of pathogens. 2 Pharyngeal and nasal specimens (cotton swabs) were routinely obtained twice weekly for isolation of viruses, weekly for Mycoplasma and monthly for analysis of the bacterial flora. During respiratory illnesses, throat and nasal specimens for bacterial and viral analyses were generally obtained on three consecutive days soon after the onset of symptoms.",

The increased number of infections observed in asthmatics was accounted for chiefly by the rhinoviruses (84.6 vs. 50.0%, P = 0.042). Twenty-four respiratory infections occurred concurrently in an asthmatic and his sibling which were of identical etiology (Table IV) . These included 4 influenza A2, 3 parainfluenza, 12 rhinovirus, 1 herpes simplex, and 4 group A streptococcal infections. Agents which occurred concurrently were responsible for 13 severe, 4 mild, and 7 asymptomatic respiratory infections in asthmatics and for 14 severe, 2 mild, and 8 asymptomatic respiratory infections in nonasthmatics, The average duration of concurrent infections which resulted in mild or severe SRI was 6.1 days for asthmatics and 4.4 days for nonasthmatics (data not shown in tables). Although illnesses were of longer duration in asthmatics, this difference was not statistically (P > 0.05) significant.",

More likely, somehow, the asthmatic is placed in a circumstance whereby the virus is more easily transmitted to him than to a normal person. The rhinoviruses are actually quite difficult to transmit under natural conditions. We found no transmission of rhinovirus type 55 between groups of infected \"donors\" and serum antibody-free \"recipients\" when placed together for two or three hours in a small room, and only one of 14 \"recipients\" became infected when kissed by rhinovirus-55-infected\"donors\" for 1 to 1 89 minutes, t7 Additionally, we have found a transmis- 84.6% rate of the asthmatics (Table III) . It seems reasonable that this increased rate of infection for asthmatics may be related to their necessarily inceased indoor life in a cold climate such as that found in Wisconsin.
