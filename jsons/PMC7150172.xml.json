Hilleman was raised by his uncle while his father struggled to cope with raising his eight children under harsh circumstances on their family farm. Hilleman graduated from high school in 1937 in the midst of the Great Depression. As a poor farm boy without prospects or means, he took jobs in local stores and worked very hard but had little opportunity to advance his education. Inspired by an older brother studying at a divinity school, Hilleman applied for, and won, a full scholarship to Montana State University where he graduated first in his class at the age of 21 with a joint degree in chemistry and microbiology. He was offered scholarships at ten universities, and chose the University of Chicago for graduate studies in microbiology where, despite scholarships, he lived under squalid conditions. He received his PhD in 1944 with an award-winning dissertation which was on Chlamydia.",

Producing vaccines requires introducing a weakened live- or dead agent\u2014i.e., virus, bacteria, parasite, or other infective organism, or part of the organism\u2014that can stimulate the production of protective antibodies. He developed a vaccine against Japanese B encephalitis, which was urgently needed to immunize troops at the Pacific front of World War II.\n",

Influenza remained a yearly occurrence after the horrendous 1918 Swine Flu pandemic which killed tens of millions of people, primarily young men. But no new, virulent influenza type emerged until early 1957. In February 1957, a life-threatening wave of flu was spreading across China with reports of 20,000 cases in Hong Kong. Then still a microbiologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Hilleman suspected this could become a pandemic threat and coined the term Asian flu. He obtained a sample of the virus from an ill US serviceman and determined that most people lacked antibody protection for this new influenza virus. He initiated vaccine production by sending virus samples to manufacturers and urging them to develop a vaccine within four months, producing 40 million doses of vaccine and so reducing the US epidemic, which caused an estimated 70,000 deaths in the United States. World-wide, from 1957 to 1958, some two million people died from Asian flu. Subsequently new influenza strains have continuously emerged in Asia.",

He continued studying and received his master\u2019s degree in 1953, and was awarded full scholarship toward a PhD in medical microbiology and chemistry. Working at the University of Texas in Galveston from 1956 to 1958, Hayflick learned techniques of cell cultures producing large numbers of selected cells with long term survival and replication living in controlled conditions. Fetal cells were considered safer than other cell lines as the latter could be genetically abnormal, contain undetected viruses such as those of animal origin, or carry cancer genes. The famous HeLa cell line was the oldest and most commonly used human cell line derived from cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks, a patient who died of her cancer in 1951. The cell line, extremely readily grown and survivable, was used extensively in scientific research including production of the inactivated Salk vaccine in 1954. Considerable controversy surrounds this even today because the sample was taken without the patient's permission and because of the possibility of its carrying cancer genetic material.",

The Hayflick strain developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia called WI-38 was widely accepted as an alternative to primary monkey kidney and HeLa cells. WI-38 provided a cell line from normal human embryonic tissues with a normal chromosomal constitution with no transfer of tumors in animal models. This cell strain was accepted in Europe where Hayflick\u2019s WI-38 cell line was approved for use in vaccines. Since the 1960s, WI-38 became the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. WI-38 was provided by Hayflick to Stanley Plotkin for use for the development of a new rubella virus growth and its resultant vaccine, licensed in 1970. WI-38 was also used in the production of the first oral polio vaccine made on a continuously propagated cell strain. Hayflick is renowned as a professor of gerontological studies at the University of California, San Francisco. His landmark studies are characterized as \u201cHayflick Limit\u201d in cellular ageing and basic longevity studies. His contribution to vaccinology is the WI-38 cell line along with chick embryo cells which have been used for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines world-wide. Vaccines using WI-38 cells have immunized many hundreds of millions of people, include oral poliomyelitis (Sabin), measles, rubella, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses, and hepatitis A vaccines. Hilleman and his team using WI-38 cells developed the majority of the\n14 vaccines currently recommended for childhood routine immunization and led in the development of other vaccines.",

The measles vaccine went through a long process of development with many key players, including John Enders and Samuel L. Katz, who isolated measles virus in a blood sample from 13-year-old David Edmonston, subsequently called the \u201cEdmonston strain.\u201d Working with other scientists, Enders and Katz turned this strain into a vaccine licensed in the United States in 1963. This was an attenuated i.e., using a live, but weakened, measles strain so that it would not cause the disease, but rather act as a vaccine by promoting the production of sufficient antibodies to protect against subsequent exposure to the natural measles virus. In 1968, Hilleman and colleagues developed and further improved the \u201cEdmonston-Enders\u201d strain, which remains the primary measles vaccine used in the United States. In 1981 Hilleman developed the first viral subunit vaccine based on the work of Baruch Blumberg and Wolf Szmuness on the Australian antigen, a cell membrane surface protein of the hepatitis B virus, rather than the entire virus, producing a vaccine licensed in 1986. Hepatitis B recombinant vaccine is inexpensive to produce and is used worldwide for newborns to prevent later development of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is based on Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene inserted into yeast or cells free of any concerns associated with human blood products. This was a breakthrough in vaccinology as recombinant vector vaccines methods promised improvements in vaccine research, production, lower costs, temperature stability, and ease of administration. This also provided hope for faster vaccine response to emerging infectious agents. In 1987 Hilleman produced and the first US FDA licensed congugate vaccine based on fat from the bacterial cell wall attached to a protein to produce Hemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine. This vaccine protects against this serious respiratory infection in babies aged 0\u201318 months with dramatic reductions in cases and deaths within a few years. Hilleman also developed varicella (chicken pox) and hepatitis A vaccines\u2014both licensed in 1995\u2014with important public health benefits.",

Levels of immunization coverage required for herd immunity can vary for different disease organisms, but in the case of measles it requires over 95 percent immunization coverage over a long period of time by an adequate two-dose policy, with monitoring, funding, and quality assurance for immunization programs. Adequacy means coverage of the population at risk of the disease as groups with inadequate vaccination become unexpectedly vulnerable as, for example, in recent importation and spread of measles and mumps in the Americas where these diseases had previously been considered eliminated. New challenges emerge requiring increasing vaccination coverage including tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza for pregnant women, and their family members and care givers to protect newborns who are vulnerable until their immunization can be completed. Herd immunity (i.e., immunity by vaccination among a high percentage of a population sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission by isolated cases which varies for different diseases) must be achieved and maintained to reduce the potential for transmission of a disease to vulnerable people such as people with immune deficiency due to infection with HIV, cancer chemotherapy, or immunodeficiency diseases. In other cases, giving rubella vaccine to boys as well as girls to reduce or eliminate circulation of the virus prevents infections during pregnancy, which can lead to congenital rubella syndrome in infants, a disease that can result in lifelong disability (see Chapters 3, 12, 16Chapter 3Chapter 12Chapter 16).",

The outbreak led to 2016 changes in Californian law requiring parents to consult with the local public health office and requiring a medical certificate stating medical reasons for exemption.

Hilleman was undoubtedly the leading vaccinologist of the 20th century, and perhaps of all time. In 1988, he was awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honor in the United States, and although he received many professional honors he never achieved the popular recognition or fame of other pioneers in vaccine development and implementation such as the developers and leaders in poliomyelitis vaccine, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin.",

Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, called Hilleman \u201cone of the true giants of science, medicine and public health in the 20th century.\u201d When Hilleman died in 2005, after a truly magnificent scientific career of 60 years, Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the BMJ: \u201cHis commitment was to make something useful and convert it to clinical use. Maurice\u2019s genius was in developing vaccines, reliably reproducing them, and he was in charge of all pharmaceutical facets from research to the marketplace.\u201d The BMJ obituary for Hilleman stated: \u201cAlmost all of Hilleman\u2019s career was in the pharmaceutical industry to develop, in cooperation with academic scientists, vaccines that brought science to the direct benefit of mankind saving millions of deaths especially of children.\u201d Dr. Faucci, stated: \u201cMaurice was perhaps the single most influential public health figure of the twentieth century, if one considers the millions of lives saved and the countless people who were spared suffering because of his work. Over the course of his career, Maurice and his colleagues developed more than forty vaccines. Of the fourteen vaccines currently recommended in the United States, Maurice developed eight.\u201d\n",

He introduced new approaches to vaccinology which others following his path can use help to control\u2014or eliminate\u2014important diseases now, and others that in the future may face humanity.
