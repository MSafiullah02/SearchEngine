This message was subsequently shown to be composed of RNA and its short life is a well-known curse of experimentalists who try to extract it from cells. The instability is caused principally by the activity of ribonucleases, which are abundant in cells and seem to lie eagerly in wait of vulnerable substrates. Seemingly nuisances, these enzymes in fact play important roles in the regulation of gene expression, for example, in the course of development or in response to environmental change [1]. In prokaryotes, nucleases affect the differential processing and rate of degradation of polycistronic transcripts, and thus may contribute to the coordinated stoichiometric synthesis of the subunits of multicomponent complexes [2].",

            "text": "The apparent wanton destruction of RNA by ribonucleases poses several questions: how do cells maintain folded RNA structures, such as tRNA and ribosomes, in the presence of all these keen ribonucleases? Conversely, how are unstructured or damaged RNAs identified and turned over? Lastly, many different types of structured RNAs are synthesized as precursors that must be trimmed to form the mature species. Are there dedicated, highly specific nucleases that do this controlled trimming? Perhaps the answer to all these questions stems from the observation that the turnover of mRNA and the processing of structural RNA share common steps; for instance, in Escherichia coli, the processing of rRNA and the degradation of mRNA both start with endonucleolytic cleavage followed by exonucleolytic attack on the fragments [3\u2022\u2022]. Many of the ribonucleases that turn over transcripts play dual roles in the degradation of stable RNA and the processing or fidelity checking and stress-triggered decay of structured RNA. As proposed by Deutscher [3\u2022\u2022], the structure of the RNA itself may be the signal that steers it to a course of maturation or to a fate of destruction; we shall explore how these implicit signals are recognized. As is often the case, eukaryotes are more complicated and might have dedicated complex machinery for the different tasks of degradation and quality control [1]. Here, the choice of processing versus turnover may be affected by the time lag of processing, in analogy to kinetic proofreading of translational fidelity [4\u2022\u2022].",

The ribonuclease is a composite of recurrent folds, although these were not detected by sequence similarity. The catalytic domain of RNase E contains structural subdomains, such as DNase I and RNase H (Figure 1a), and an S1 subdomain, which occurs in many different RNA-binding proteins. In RNase E, the S1 subdomain clamps down on the RNA substrate and appears to be flexibly tethered to the body of the nuclease (see the summary in Figure 2\n). The catalytic site is situated in the DNase I subdomain, where a single metal-binding site is found (Figure 1b); however, it is possible that there is a second metal-binding site in the transition state. (The use of two-metal clusters as catalytic centres is a recurrent theme in other ribonucleases; see Table 1.) Cleavage is by nucleophilic attack on the phosphate backbone within a single-stranded A/U-rich region, generating fragments with a free 3\u2032-OH (on the 5\u2032 side of cleavage) and a 5\u2032-monophosphate (on the 3\u2032 side). The RNase E structure suggests that recognition of the 5\u2032 end of the substrate induces a conformational switch that results in the phosphate backbone being oriented for attack by an OH group activated by a coordinated magnesium ion.",

            "text": "In E. coli and probably many other related Gram-negative bacteria, RNase E is part of a multienzyme assembly known as the RNA degradosome [15, 16]. The other components of the degradosome are the glycolytic enzyme enolase, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (RhlB) and the phosphorolytic exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). The physical association of these proteins within the degradosome coordinates their enzymatic activities. PNPase is a processive phosphorolytic exonuclease that may work together with RNase E to ensure the cooperative destruction of substrates once the first cleavage is made; it is also involved in checking the fidelity of rRNA precursors as a quality control mechanism [17]. RhlB is required to unwind structured RNA substrates so that they become suitable substrates for the nucleases of the degradosome. The role of enolase is unclear, but the available evidence indicates that its recruitment into the degradosome assembly is required to control levels of transcripts for the glucose transporter [18, 19]. An enolase recognition motif occurs in RNase E homologues from other Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens such as Salmonella, and it seems likely that, in these organisms, the enolase interacts with RNase E [20].",

RNase II cuts single-stranded (ss)RNA processively in a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction, using a hydrolytic mechanism, and releases nucleotide monophosphates as it gallops along (summarized in Figure 2). Crystal structures of the apo form of E. coli RNase II and of an inactive mutant in complex with ssRNA have been reported [21\u2022\u2022, 22\u2022\u2022] (Figure 3a). This revealed another multidomain molecular montage, composed of two cold-shock domains (CSDs) at the N-terminal end, followed by a catalytic domain and, finally, an S1 domain. The X-ray data reveal that the single-stranded substrate lies deep in a channel at the bottom of which is the catalytic site [21\u2022\u2022] (Figure 3a). One magnesium ion is present in the active site, coordinated by aspartates. The inactivating mutation in RNase II lies at a putative metal-coordinating residue, D209N, and Fraz\u00e3o et al. [21\u2022\u2022] propose that two metals may be involved in the activation of a water molecule for hydrolysis of the terminal phosphodiester, analogous to the active sites of polymerases and perhaps some ribozymes [23]. This hypothesis is corroborated by the mutagenesis studies of Zuo et al [22\u2022\u2022]. The organization of the active site of RNase II has striking parallels with the active site of the endoribonuclease RNase H; thus, even though the folds differ, the enzymes are likely to share similar catalytic chemistries.",

In a striking parallel with certain types of RNA helicases, RNase R can sense the polarity of the phosphodiester backbone of the substrate. Thus, the ribonuclease greatly prefers substrates with single-stranded regions at the 3\u2032 end. The ribonuclease can processively degrade structured substrates, provided they have a 3\u2032 single-stranded overhang that is seven or more nucleotides in length [24\u2022]. Cleavage occurs at the single-stranded 3\u2032 overhang and proceeds processively in the 5\u2032 direction, ploughing straight through the secondary structure (Figure 2). Whereas DEAD-box helicases use the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to disrupt secondary structure, RNase R transduces the favourable free energy of RNA backbone hydrolysis into mechanical work that translates the single-stranded substrate further into the catalytic pocket, much like a ratchet. The linkage between RNA cleavage and unwinding of secondary structure is most likely indirect, and may involve changes in the energy of RNA binding to the catalytic pocket and to the S1 subdomain. One hypothesis is that the energy-dependent ratcheting mechanism pulls the duplex RNA against the apex of the tunnel, into which it cannot fit, thus causing it to unwind. It is not presently clear why RNase R manages to perform this operation, whereas homologous RNase II does not. Nevertheless, RNase R seems to have evolved a very clever mechanism to convert the energy of hydrolysis into work of unwinding, and thus seems to be a model of energy conservation. In eukaryotes, the RNase R homologue is a component of the exosome assembly, which we will discuss below.",

RNase H enzymes cleave duplex RNA or RNA\u2013DNA hybrids, and are representative of a large family whose members include transposases and the Argonaute ribonuclease, which is involved in RNA silencing. RNase III cleaves double-stranded (ds)RNA and the E. coli enzyme is a model system for the entire family, which includes eukaryotic enzymes such as Dicer (involved in the RNAi mechanism).

[28] for E. coli RNase H. A recent crystallographic analysis reveals the stepwise participation of the two magnesium metals in the RNase H mechanism, with the first participating in nucleophilic activation of water and the second metal stabilizing the transition state [29, 30]. Reflecting the distinct roles of the two metals, they are coordinated in non-equivalent ways. By contrast, metal coordination is symmetrical in the RNase-H-like transposases; this is required because the metals have equivalent roles in the successive steps of nucleophilic activation of water during strand cleavage and 3\u2032-OH activation during strand transfer [31].",

Crystal structures of the core of the exosomes from the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Archaeoglobus fulgidus have recently become available, revealing a hexameric ring comprising two types of RNase-PH-like subunits, known as Rrp41 and Rrp42 (rRNA-processing proteins 41 and 42; see Figure 4a) [36\u2022, 37\u2022\u2022, 38\u2022].

            "text": "In vertebrates, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) function in ribosome processing in the nucleolus; some have a role in the modification of bases or cutting of rRNA precursors [42]. Some snoRNAs are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage, through the action of enzymes such as the manganese-dependent endoribonuclease XendoU from the amphibian Xenopus laevis [43]. Sequence alignment reveals similar proteins in other eukaryotes (including human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana), nidoviruses and, remarkably, the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme [44\u2022]. This might indicate the versatile use of this fold in RNA processing. A homologous enzyme, known as NendoU, is a component of the genomic replication apparatus of the SARS virus and other members of the coronavirus family [45]. These enzymes, which we refer to as belonging to the EndoU family, are specific for uracil and the product has a 2\u2032-3\u2032 cyclic phosphate; this is usually an indication that the ribose sugar 2\u2032-OH is oriented and activated to act as a nucleophile. Crystal structures have become available for the NendoU enzymes from SARS virus [46\u2022] and mouse hepatitis virus [47], and for XendoU from X. laevis [44\u2022]. These data reveal a common, unique fold that distinguishes the EndoU family from any other ribonuclease family identified thus far (Figure 5\n). Remarkably, the position of the key catalytic residues in the active sites of XendoU and NendoU mimics the position of corresponding residues in the ribonuclease RNase A (two histidines, which serve as general acid/general base, and a lysine) (Figure 5). This congruence is achieved with different folds and serves as a striking example of convergent evolution. The re-invention of a catalytic site usually indicates an important function, but the precise role of the viral protein is currently not well understood.",

            "text": "The use of metals to activate a nucleophile is a common theme for both endonucleases and exonucleases of the hydrolytic class. These hydrolytic reactions are highly exergonic; by contrast, phosphorolysis, in which inorganic phosphate attacks the backbone to drive bond cleavage, corresponds to a much smaller free energy change. It seems reasonable to expect that selective pressure would affect the balance of one reaction over the other. In the course of the evolution of eukaryotes, the associated genomic expansion and the tremendous amount of non-coding RNA necessitates significant investment of resources and energy. Perhaps the exosome represents an energy-efficient means of coping with the recycling of oligonucleotides, compared with the costs associated with hydrolytic decay. Some hydrolytic enzymes, such as RNase R, can use the free energy of hydrolysis to \u2018drive through\u2019 secondary structure, so that this does not require the assistance of an energy-consuming RNA helicase. Most RNAs are spared this expensive mode of destruction unless they are specified by a single-stranded 3\u2032 tail of minimal length or an exposed 5\u2032 monophosphate together with a single-stranded region. As the structure rather than the sequence itself is recognized, the fold must be under considerable evolutionary scrutiny and might be optimised to fine-tune the levels of populations of transcripts, so that the enzymes they encode have an extra layer of regulatory connections. Therefore, one speculation is that the targeting of selected transcript classes for turnover by ribonucleases might also permit the coordinated regulation of different genes and thus might deepen connections between metabolic processes [16]. This hypothesis awaits testing.",
