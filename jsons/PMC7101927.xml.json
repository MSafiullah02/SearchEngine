Physical examination revealed widespread abdominal tenderness that was more prominent in the epigastric region while a standing abdominal X-ray showed a large, dilated gastric air pocket. Laboratory test results showed urea 163 mg/dl (range 0\u201350 mg/dl), BUN 76 mg/dl (range 0\u201323 mg/dl), uric acid 15.4 mg/dl (range 0\u20136.1 mg/dl), CRP 79.5 mg/dl (range 0\u20138 mg/dl), leukocyte 20300/\u03bcl (range 4900\u20139100/\u03bcl), and potassium 2.96 mEq/l (3.1\u20135.5 mEq/l). Other laboratory test results were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated grade I hydronephrosis, increased mesenteric echo, mesenteric lymphadenopathies 1 cm in size, duodenal wall edema and ascites while the epigastric region could not be evaluated because of the presence of abundant gas. A nasogastric catheter brought up retention material. Acute abdomen was considered and the patient was taken to surgery after preoperative preparation. Laparotomy was performed with a supraumbilical incision and seropurulent free fluid was seen in the abdomen together with a 6 \u00d7 3 cm necrotic area close to the gastric fundus in the large curvature (Fig. 1). The necrotic region was excised and the gastric defect repaired. Oral intake was started on the 5th postoperative day and the patient was discharged on the 11th day with no problems.\n",

Aspergillus can enter the body through spontaneous respiration and colonize in regions such as the nose and facial sinuses. The risk of tissue invasion and hematogenous secondary spread increases in immunosuppressed patients [1]. Immunosuppressive conditions such as chemotherapy, prolonged neutropenia, corticosteroid treatment, organ transplantation, and HIV infections predispose patients to develop invasive Aspergillus infections. In addition to the classical immunosuppressive conditions, invasive infections can also be rarely encountered with chronic obstructive lung disease, bacterial infections, usage of antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, or hemodialysis [2]. Aspergillus is first localized in the blood vessels and causes thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarct in the tissue and invasion of the distant organs through hematogenous spread [3].",

The gastrointestinal system is the second most common site of invasive aspergillosis involvement after the lungs with the small intestines being involved most commonly within this system [1]. Aspergillus spores are frequently swallowed spontaneously but the gastrointestinal system is not suitable for Aspergillus growth. Increased acid secretion, disruption of the gastric mucosa barrier, mucosal ischemia and ulcer can predispose the gastric wall to the development of Aspergillus infection [3, 4]. Medical treatment and also surgical treatment of gastrointestinal aspergillosis are recommended for complications, such as bleeding, perforation, obstruction and infarct. There are only limited reports of gastrointestinal aspergillosis and therefore the most appropriate treatment thus remains to be elucidated [5].",

Only four cases of invasive aspergillosis with only gastric involvement within the gastrointestinal system have been reported (Table 1) [3\u20136]. A predisposition to infection was assumed to develop due to chemotherapy in one case [4], and high-dose steroid use in the others [3, 5, 6]. There are two cases with isolated gastric involvement and no previous lung involvement. Both were adults and died despite surgery and antifungal treatment [3, 5]. The current case did not have any predisposing drug usage history or immune suppressive condition, but the patient had been complaining of epigastric pain for a long time. Both the history of epigastric pain and the surgical findings suggested that the patient was predisposed to invasive Aspergillus infection due to chronic gastritis. Although the postoperative studies did not detect a Helicobacter pylori infection, an empirical triple cure of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin was administered.\n",
