Sachs, a global economist known for his work in developing nations, repeatedly makes the important point that the health of a nation is directly tied to the wealth of a nation.9 Wealth is enhanced by heightened competition, comparative advantage, economies of scale, and access to a greater range of products and services in globalized markets, all enabled by access to knowledge. Asymmetries of information have been reduced in an era of globalized knowledge exchange, contributing to a reduction of isolation, an increase in life spans, and improved health.10\n",

The role of ICT in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis of 2003 is a prime example. During the first cases of SARS in China in 2003, the WHO initiated a digital virtual environment consisting of 11 laboratories in 9 countries connected via ICT. Using e-mail and a secure website, these collaborators shared outcomes, post-mortem tissue analysis, electron-microscope pictures of viruses, genetic sequences and other related materials in real-time to collaboratively identify and intervene in a markedly dangerous public health risk. Other examples exist that point to the impact that ICT has had on global health efforts, such as the Academic Model for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS Medical Record System for Africa (AMPATH\u2013MRS), the Partners in Health Electronic Medical Record in Peru, the HIV Electronic Medical Record System in Haiti.14\n",

A lack of local expertise and decades of well-meaning but non-sustainable ICT projects in the developing world have left a legacy of skepticism in their wake. Systems built for Westernized health care delivery often do not match the local context, resulting in a misalignment between need and technology. Poverty and illiteracy in developing nations stand as major barriers to the adoption and sustainability of information technologies, and many believe it is difficult to make the case for ICT when basic needs for survival are barely being met.18 The \u201ce\u2013health paradox,\u201d a term coined by Liaw and Humphries, refers to this seeming conundrum; populations that may have the most to gain from ICT in health are those who are thwarted in their use due to barriers of untrained personnel, poor infrastructure, and lack of resources.19 Issues such as these have fueled technological apartheid and continue to subvert the delivery of knowledge to areas of the globe that most desperately need it.",

Dr. Yunus and the telecom company he founded20 were convinced that economic and social development should begin at the grassroots level. Yunus believed that attacking poverty is essential to peace, that private enterprise is essential to reversing poverty, and that peace and poverty reduction are essential to health.21 Yunus' microloans enabled destitute village women in Bangladesh to purchase cell phones and become Village Phone Operators (VPOs). The women then sold telecommunication services on a per-call basis to neighbors. This has resulted in considerable wealth generation not only for the VPOs, but for the farmers and village dwellers who are using this technology to access the outside world and improve their businesses.20 The VPOs provide affordable rates to their neighbors, preventing residents from making (historically, in many locales) a 6-hour round-trip to reach a telephone, which consequently impacted community productivity and increased community wealth. The VPOs earned enough to invest in their children's health, nutrition, and education, and fund other business growth. The improvement in community wealth translated into improved community health, as funds became available for the drilling of wells for clean water and preventive health services. The VPO model has been rolled out through much of Africa and is viewed by governments and development agencies such as the United Nations, USAID (United States Agency for International Development), and the World Bank as a sustainable development tool. Wealth has impacted health, which is a welcomed consequence.",

Two examples of the use of distributed e-learning in industrialized and non-industrialized nations are provided as a stimulus for further study and application:\nInternational Virtual Nursing School (IVINURS)\n26 is an interesting example of a global nursing education initiative facilitated by ICT in the industrialized world. The IVINURS is working with the International Council for Nursing (ICN) on the use of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP\u00ae) to catalogue learning resources in a digital repository that can be accessed by a number of international partners. At the present time, the IVINURS digital repository is shared by multiple global associates, including universities in Thailand, Tasmania, Ireland, Denmark, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The IVINURS does not award degrees and is built on the principles of international collaboration and the global sharing of knowledge and professional expertise. A central activity of IVINURS is the building of its digital repository and the development of associated e-learning support products, with the aim of providing quality, learning resources that can be shared on a global level by its partners, and used to enhance both e-learning and traditional instruction in their respective settings. This not-for-profit entity, registered in the United Kingdom as a Limited Company with charitable status, is still in formative stages, and expects to make available studies of its impact in the near future.\nAfrican Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) in Uganda27 is an example of using ICT in the developing world for nursing education and scale-up. This public-private partnership plans to increase the basic education level of 22 000 Kenyan nurses up to the level of \u201cregistered\u201d (diploma) from the current level of \u201cenrolled\u201d (certificate) within 5 years. At present, 70% of the nursing workforce in Kenya is comprised of \u201cenrolled\u201d nurses, whose level of education leaves them ill-prepared to handle the complex health needs of the Kenyan population. The AMREF's \u201cVirtual Nursing College\u201d currently has 4000 nurses enrolled at 100 computer-equipped training centers in 8 provinces, including several refugee camps. The curriculum is delivered via ICT and, in October of 2007, the first class of ICT-trained Kenyan nurses completed the program.28 While too early to discuss program outcomes, the fact that 70% of all nurses enrolled in this program are from rural areas speaks to a great potential for communities outside of urban centers. This model is planned to be extended to other African nations who are experiencing similar nursing crises. The AMREF program is also important because of an important but less publicized goal\u2014that all 22 000 nurses will be computer literate. This very unique and vital component leaves Kenya ready to lead in the movement towards e-health in the developing world. This could accelerate the achievement of the WHO Resolution WHA58.28, an e-health strategy adopted by the Fifty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2005 that articulates the preparation of an ICT-competent global health workforce.\n",

Without comprehensive, rigorous and accessible digital nursing data from large healthcare datasets, nursing practice remains largely invisible, and invisible nursing contributions lead to false assumptions of low nursing contribution to health and health outcomes. In reality, much has not changed since Florence Nightingale wrote in her 1863 book Notes on a Hospital, \u201cIn attempting to arrive at the truth, I have applied everywhere for information, but in scarcely an instance have I been able to obtain hospital records fit for any purposes of comparison.

The nursing informatics arena has provided avenues for nurses to serve as leaders, including multiple roles in nursing and through participation in professional organizations. However, nursing informatics, like nursing in general, stands at the edge of a workforce crisis that threatens nursing participation in the rapidly progressing world of ICT. Nursing as a profession cannot leave the progress needed in the face of accelerated global ICT solely in the hands of nurse informaticians.
