DISCUSSION In our study, we have collected both clinical and image data of nearly 200 cases from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020 in First Hospital of Changsha, the only designated hospital for admission and management of COVID-19 patients from Changsha and surrounding area. According to the official announcement of National Health Commission of China, ://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202003/948a03ad76f54d3583a018785efd7be9.shtml). The integrity and representativeness of our study illustrated a comprehensive knowledge of COVID-19 based on the radiographic feature and clinical manifestation.Zhe Xu's team[18] has reported the pathological findings of COVID-19 patients including bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, edema and hyaline membrane formation, indicating the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were also identified in the intra-alveolar spaces, indicating viral cytopathic-like changes.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "blood flow[20, 21]. The halo sing around nodules and increased vascular margins on the central side of the lesion shared the same underlying pathophysiology. The latter characteristic, additionally, also indicated vascular involvements due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface membrane of vascular endothelial cells. Our study revealed high percentage of these features from the super-early to late stage, suggesting the inflammatory cells infiltration, interstitial damage and exudation prolonged during the disease evolution.Consolidation occurrence peaked in the intermediate stage and declined subsequently, which correlated with inflammation infiltration and exudate accumulation. On the contrary, GGO occurrence was found a drop in intermediate stage and rebounded in late stage because of the absorption of consolidation, indicating underlying recovery. The same trend could also be noticed in reversed halo sign and air bronchogram, corresponding to alveolar septal inflammation and cellular debris in alveolar spaces surrounded by ring-shaped or crescent consolidation. As the disease progresses, the affected area spread more peripherally, forming a parallelism between the pleura and the long axis of the lesion, and more parenchymal bands were noticed, indicating that early inflammation was gradually absorbed and replaced by fibroid recovery along with the disease evolution. Additionally, long axis parallelism may correlate with the virus spreading within alveolar epithelial cells, which diffusely located in the peripheral area and facilitated SARS-CoV2 infusion due to large amount of ACE2 expression on the cellular surface membrane. We have assessed the radiographic progression based on the features of first CT scan and found that younger aged patients tended to have higher rate of improvement or stabilization. On the other hand, no relationship was found between radiographic characteristics and outcomes, indicating that none of the CT scan features had predictive value statistically. However, relatively higher percentage of bilateral and multiple lobes (\u22653) involvements were noticed in the worsening group accordingly. As a result, decision should be made comprehensively based on image tests, laboratory results and clinical symptoms when making further management strategy. In 187 cases, we have found that patients with positive findings of COVID-19 shared elder age, higher rate of fever, higher level of neutrophils, CRP, ESR and LDH; lower level of WBC, lymphocytes and albumin(P<0.001).
