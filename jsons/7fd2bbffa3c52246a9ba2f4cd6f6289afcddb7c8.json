There are >80 Nocardia species, but those usually involved in human disease are the Nocardia asteroides complex. Nocardia are found in soil, decaying vegetable matter and stagnant water. Inhalation is the most common route of entry so pneumonia is the most common infection. The main risk factors are defects in T-cell-mediated immunity (e.g. after transplantation), prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, malignancy, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), diabetes mellitus, chronic granulomatous disease and alveolar proteinosis. Nocardia pneumonia usually develops over weeks with cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever and night sweats, but can be more acute. Common radiological features are patches of dense consolidation or macronodules, frequently pleurally based. Cavitation and pleural effusions are common. These appearances can be mistaken for metastasis. Local spread to the pericardium and mediastinum, and haematogenous spread to brain, joints and soft tissue, occur in about half of patients. The diagnosis can be made rapidly through identification of characteristic beaded, branching Gram-positive and weakly acid-fast filaments on microscopy.

Respiratory viruses usually cause a bronchiolitis that presents with coryzal symptoms, cough, fever and dyspnoea. In a minority of patients auscultation of the lungs reveals characteristic squeaks or wheeze. The chest radiograph is often normal or non-specific. CT classically demonstrates diffuse 'tree-in-bud' changes suggestive of small airways inflammation, but can also show ground-glass infiltrates. The diagnosis can be rapidly confirmed using nasopharyngeal aspirate samples for viral antigen immunofluorescence or PCR for viral nucleic acids, the latter favoured in immunocompromised hosts. If nasopharyngeal aspirate results are negative, immunofluorescence or PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has higher sensitivity. In the absence of pneumonia, mortality from respiratory virus infection is relatively low, although infection can persist for several weeks.

Clinically, this is suspected when there is relapse of fever and respiratory symptoms with new radiographic evidence of infiltrates, but it is important to note that fever may not be present in immunocompromised individuals. Antibiotic treatment for secondary bacterial infection should cover the organisms most commonly encountered after influenza, including Strep. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Novel viruses have emerged including the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus and avian influenza A strain H7N9. The latter has a low rate of transmission but a high associated mortality.

CMV infection is defined as active CMV replication regardless of symptoms or signs, and CMV disease is infection associated with evidence of organ-specific disease. CMV infection in immunocompromised patients usually results from reactivation of latent CMV acquired in early life; however, it can also be primary infection in previously uninfected individuals, in whom it is often more severe. Pneumonitis is an important complication, commonly presenting with insidious onset of fever, malaise, cough and dyspnoea with hypoxia. Classic features on CT are symmetrical peribronchovascular and alveolar infiltrates predominantly affecting the lower lobes, but asymmetrical changes, consolidation and effusions are not uncommon. In suspected CMV infection/disease, CMV replication can easily be identified and the viral load determined by PCR or CMV pp65 antigen testing of blood or BALF. CMV infection can also be identified by culture of urine, throat and BALF specimens. Evidence of CMV reactivation does not always mean that concurrent lung disease is caused by CMV and, conversely, CMV viraemia is occasionally absent in patients with CMV pneumonitis. CMV pneumonitis is more likely with high-level viraemia, especially if the viral load increased rapidly. Furthermore, high CMV DNA loads (>500 IU/ml) in BALF from HSCT recipients are associated with poor outcome. 1 CMV pneumonitis can also be confirmed by finding inclusion bodies in BALF cells or transbronchial or videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS) biopsy samples.",

Treatment efficacy is monitored by measuring blood CMV viral load, with treatment usually continued for at least 2 weeks after resolution of viraemia.

The lung is the port of entry for disseminated infection (usually to the CNS), and neurological symptoms should prompt a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid culture. Diagnosis is by microscopic identification (Indian ink stain) or culture from respiratory tract samples. Identification of cryptococcal antigens using a lateral flow assay is sensitive for detecting the presence of Cryptococcus, but up to 34% of results showing low positive titres are actually false-positives.",

            "text": "These are found in specific geographical areas and cause primary infection by inhalation or inoculation of contaminated material (e.g. bat faeces). Reactivation of latent infection can occur in immunocompromised patients, especially with defects in T-cellmediated immunity, so a history of travel or residence in a highrisk area can be relevant. Common endemic fungi causing pulmonary infections include Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides (Candida immitis, Candida posadasii), Blastomyces dermatitidis and Sporothrix schenckii. Presentation varies by pathogen but tends to mimic tuberculosis, with cavitating pneumonias, pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes or a miliary pattern. Systemic dissemination is not uncommon in immunocompromised patients. Diagnosis requires identification of the fungus in respiratory samples or biopsy material, including bone marrow aspirates. Culture can take 6 weeks. H. capsulatum can be rapidly detected with an antigen detection assay but this can cross-react with other endemic fungi. Serology identifies patients with previous exposure for most fungi, but is not reliable in immunocompromised patients. Mortality is high without timely appropriate treatment. ",
