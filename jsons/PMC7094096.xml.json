Compared with the work in Gutfraind and Meyers (2015), our model possesses the following features of the blood transfusion dynamics. (1) Our model contains a treatment decision period upon hospital admission, and reflects the fact that every hospitalized patient can be considered for blood transfusion regardless of their current length of stay. In this way, the probability for a patient to receive blood transfusion depends on the blood bank level during the whole period of their hospital stay. (2) We model the recovery time from the most recent donation by the delay suggested by WHO (2014b), so that the period between the current and forthcoming donation could follow a distribution of lags with a lowest value of \u03c4 days. (3) More importantly, the strategy for distributing blood stockpiles is modeled with a function involves both of the up-to-date blood bank level and a measurement of the decision on preserving stockpiles for emergency purposes. This function can be easily modified with specific stockpile deployment policies, and our model is suitable for evaluating relevant future treatment plans.",

As other infection control measures including isolation, contact tracing (Webb et al., 2015) and early diagnosis (Chowell et al., 2015) all contribute to shortening the switching time from palliative care to blood transfusion treatment, an integrated strategy of Ebola control must incorporate the consideration of blood transfusion services. All of these infection control measures are implicitly incorporated into the decaying transmission rate of the model (Althaus, 2014) we have adopted. Incorporating these measures explicitly in our model will only require appropriate modifications in the disease transmission dynamics (S,L,I)-components.",
