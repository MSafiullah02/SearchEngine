The purpose of this study is to identify diseases that co-occur with HIV/AIDS and analyze the gender differences. Data was collected from 536 HIV/AIDS admission medical records out of 1,377,469 admission medical records from 1997 to 2010 in Taiwan. In this study, the comorbidity relationships are presented in the phenotypic disease network (PDN), and \u03c6-correlation is used to measure the distance between two diseases on the network. The results show that there is a high correlation in the following pairs/triad of diseases: human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified conditions (042) and pneumocystosis pneumonia (1363), human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified malignant neoplasms (0422) and kaposi's sarcoma of other specified sites (1768), human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and unspecified (0429) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (0463), and lastly, human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified infections (0420), meningoencephalitis due to toxoplasmosis (1300), and human immunodeficiency virus infection specified infections causing other specified infections (0421).",

Adolescents were at the center of the pandemic in terms of transmission, impact, and potential for changing the attitudes and behaviors that underlie this disease. Therefore, HIV/AIDS prevention has become a priority all over the world. The first HIV/AIDS case in Taiwan was reported in 1984. As of the end of 2013, the total number of HIV/AIDS cases had been accumulated to 26,475. Faced with this serious situation, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control worked with other departments and dedicated a tremendous amount of effort and resources to introduce harm reduction programs. Total reported cases dropped in 2006, which was the first trend reversal since 1984. In 2008 and thereafter, the epidemic took a turn; infections mainly occurred through sexual encounter [1] .",

            "text": "Through the PDN, this paper has identified the diseases that are associated with HIV/AIDS. It could be showed that the PDN has a complex structure where some diseases are highly connected while others are barely connected at all. While not conclusive, these observations can explain the observation that more connected diseases are seen to be more lethal, as patients developing highly connected diseases are more likely those at an advanced stage of disease, which can be reached through multiple paths in the PDN. The findings suggest that human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified conditions (042) and pneumocystosis pneumonia is highly correlated (1363). This result is consistent with Aliouat-Denis, Chab\u00e9, Demanche, Aliouat el, Viscogliosi, Guillot, Delhaes, and Dei-Cas's study [13] . Pneumocystis pneumonia is especially seen in people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, and the use of medications that suppress the immune system. Human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified infections (0420) and meningoencephalitis due to toxoplasmosis (1300) is highly correlation. Besides, it is also highly correlation with human immunodeficiency virus infection specified infections causing other specified infections (0421). The result is the same as Dubey, Hill, Jones, Hightower, Kirkland, Roberts, Marcet, Lehmann, Vianna, Miska, Sreekumar, Kwok, Shen, and Gamble''s study [14] . Human immunodeficiency virus infection with specified malignant neoplasms (0422) and kaposi's sarcoma of other specified sites (1768) is highly correlation. The result is the same as Holmes, Hawson, Liu, Friedman, Khiabanian, and Rabadan's study [15] . Since patients infected with HIV/AIDS have a high risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma, the prevention of this malignant disease should be prioritized. Human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and unspecified (0429) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (0463) is highly correlation. The result is the same as Casado, Corral, Garc\u00eda, Martinez-San Mill\u00e1n, Navas, Moreno, and Moreno's study [16] and Sano, Nakano, Omoto, Takao, Ikeda, Oga, Nakamichi, Saijo, Maoka, Sano, Kawai, Kanda [17] . Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a usually fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage or inflammation of the white matter of the brain at multiple locations. It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system. JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurs almost exclusively in patients with severe immune deficiency, most commonly among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but people on chronic immunosuppressive medications including chemotherapy are also at increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [16, 17] .",
