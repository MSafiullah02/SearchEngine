Importantly, the China Meteorological Administration developed an information sharing mechanism that also includes the Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the State Administration of Radio Film and Television. Thus, full use of newspapers, radio and television, as well as new media outlets, has become a vital part of Chinese disaster communication (Yang and Mao, 2012).",

To meet the needs from agriculture, industries, commercial businesses, and the general public, some newspapers even dedicate an entire colourful page to weather information. It has been argued that weather forecasts are very low in informativity because of their tightly constrained format, topic, situation and medium (de Beaugrande, 1997). However, weather commentaries seem to vary greatly between countries. So while de Beaugrande's statement might be true for some cultures, it does not apply to Chinese weather commentaries, which are not limited to rigid formulaic forecasts about temperature, wind and rain. (Examples of commentaries are available in Section 2.2.)",

Thus, advice on health related precautions, risk and safety, recommended actions and activities, and general health-care are typical parts of Chinese weather commentaries. The advice provided is widely recognised as valuable information and as an appreciated tool in everyday life (e.g. Liu, 2011, Ye and Chen, 2011). In Chinese culture, advice-giving is generally viewed positively as an expression of friendly concern (Hinkel, 1997). Furthermore, in Chinese society, perhaps unlike many other cultures, there are presumed and reinforced direct links between weather and health. With time, the availability of weather advice in top national and local newspapers seems to have contributed to a culture even more attuned to this link; in fact, present-day thoughts about the impact of climate change on human health are increasingly incorporated into these weather commentaries.",

At the micro-level, following Searle's (1969) tradition, advice is seen as \u201ca directive or a recommendation towards a course of action that the advice giver considers profitable or relevant\u201d to the recipient (Vehvil\u00e4inen, 2012:32; see also Haverkate, 1984). Thus, there is a presupposed problem (Angouri, 2012), and the instrumental purpose of giving advice is to trigger an action (Schmidt and Richards, 1980) or a promise of a future action from the hearer (Searle, 1969). Hyland and Hyland (2012:53) have suggested that advice \u201cis generally only ever given by those who feel they know what is best for the recipient\u201d. Importantly, their observation does not assume personal knowledge or contact between speaker and hearer. This means that when we judge whether an expression constitutes advice or not, we are in part judging whether the (future) action can be seen as beneficial or not (Rintell, 1979, Edmondson and House, 1981, Banerjee and Carrell, 1988, Trosborg, 1995, Flor, 2005).",

Whatever the communication, it is important to establish a relationship between speaker/writer and hearer/reader (Hyland, 2005). Depending on how writers cognitively position themselves in relation to putative readers, writers of weather texts may give advice as an expert, a reporter, a colleague, or a friend. Such interpersonal relations are realised in texts through the use of interpersonal linguistic resources such as vocatives, modality, and appraisal words (e.g. Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004). However, both the use and interpretation of the interpersonal linguistic resources need strategies to make communications successful. Choices of advice-giving strategies may be greatly affected by advice-givers\u2019 perceptions of social status (Matsumura, 2001). Failure to correctly use the strategies on the writer's part and failure to correctly perceive and interpret the strategies on the reader's part both can cause serious failures in communication (Banerjee and Carrell, 1988, Borderia-Garcia, 2006).",

            "text": "In the context of educational feedback on dissertations or essays, Waring, 2007, Waring, 2012 and Angouri (2012) observed peer interactions. Waring explored the use of explanatory accounts in advice-giving, noting in particular how accounts can be present in several sequential positions. Angouri, on the other, depicted how even peer-advisors enact an expert or senior advisory role in non-formal interactions. Hyland and Hyland (2012) studied advice-giving in teacher written feedback on ESL academic writing. In particular, they looked at the interpersonal role, the forms and patterns of teacher feedback as advice, and students\u2019 response and interpretation of the advice. The study revealed a mismatch of expectations between teacher and student. Culpeper et al. (2008) found that while mentors in general seem to value optionality and solidarity-enhancing talk over directive and authoritative discourse in their interactions with foreign language assistants, mentors in France favoured solidarity-enhancing discourse, coupled with a directive style, to a greater extent compared to those in England. Similarly, through the linguistic analyses of vignettes, DeCapua and Dunham (2012) examined the types of advice-giving and the relational strategies employed by students preparing to be teachers of young children. They concluded that the type and frequency of components of advice-giving vary according to topic, that the components interact with each other to set the tone of advice, and that relational strategies work to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving, promote bonding and good relationships between the advice-giver and seeker. Both Angouri (2012) and Vehvil\u00e4inen (2012) have focussed on \u201cproblem-solving\u201d interactions featuring direct questions. Vehvil\u00e4inen found that Finnish supervisors use question-answer sequences (i.e. question preface) to allow the student's knowledge and perspective to surface; insight that in turn can be used to tailor the advice, and thus minimise the lilkelihood of the advice falling on deaf ears.",

Heritage and Sefi observed that mother-initiated advice is infrequent and could be in the form of straightforward question-answer sequences or in a more cautious and indirect way by describing a state of affairs as problematic. Advice-giving initiated by health visitors, on the other hand, occur much more frequently and often in a stepwise way. Interestingly, Tully et al. (1997) found that consumers and pharmacists have different ideas concerning who needs advice and when and how advice should be given. Zayts and Schnurr (2012) studied how medical providers interactionally manage the tension between giving advice and ensuring patient autonomy, typically by framing their responses as giving information rather than giving advice. They are also more direct when patients\u2019 advice-seeking is framed as questions around other aspects than the medical decision. Based on their research of two Internet advice columns on sexual health, Harvey et al. (2013) claimed that advice-giving is a delicate act to carry out because of \u201cinescapable messages of authority, expertise and intimacy in advice\u201d (DeCapua and Huber, 1995:128) and is thus generally considered to be face-threatening in Anglo-western contexts (Goldsmith and MacGeorge, 2000, Vine, 2004). Therefore, they proposed the importance for advice-givers to think about linguistic strategies to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving. Harrison and Barlow (2009) showed that the face-threatening aspects of advice-giving can be successfully addressed in peer-to-peer advice-giving through indirect strategies, such as indirect suggestions framed as declaratives or rhetorical questions. This study, which focused on online self-management for people with arthritis, made a special note of the use of personal narratives, which serve both as an indirect strategy for giving advice, and a positive politeness strategy demonstrating shared concerns and experiences.",

            "text": "Advice-giving in call-in radio advice programmes is commonly framed by mitigation strategies; for example, hosts tend to avoid direct language forms by adopting the same terms as clients when describing a third party's advice (Hudson, 1990, Pudlinski, 2005). They also use hedges (e.g. maybe) and the imperative, when inquiring about a further more specific safe course of action, and refer to an expert when clients implicitly seek advice. DeCapua and Dunham (1993) revealed that hosts prefer to use explanations, elaborations and narrations to help clients\u2019 advice-seeking. Going further, Pudlinski (2012) described how hosts can pursue advice that is initially rejected by the caller. He identified three sequential and functional strategies: interrogating for information about the caller's own experiences, supporting the advice with additional accounts, and expressing concern or worry to further extend advice pursuit. Drescher (2012) identified some cultural differences after comparing patterns of advice-giving in phone-in programmes in French and Cameroonian cultures, while Emmison and Firth (2012) concluded that the delivery of advice is often constrained by particular institutional practices. In an investigation of online Spanish peer-to-peer advice-giving, Placencia (2012) identified Guidance as the core move. In her study of advice letters on the Internet, Locher (2006) noticed an overall preference for hedging as a face-saving strategy. Morrow (2006) analysed online British texts and uncovered an informal style of advice-giving, expressing positive regard and solidarity. Following this study up, Morrow (2012) turned to Japanese advice-giving on the internet. He observed that generally advice is framed in polite question forms and that advice-givers often take an empathetic stance by recounting their own experiences and using first person plural volitional forms.",

Comparing advice-giving in Chinese and English, Lu (2014) discovered that Chinese speakers think about the social power relationship much more than English speakers. Yan (2011) revealed that most advice-giving speech acts in forum response posts on the issue of love on the Internet are direct and are framed in the form of imperatives (see Li, 2009 for a historical account of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic forms of advice-giving). Similarly to Waring, 2007, Waring, 2012, Ren (2013) found that adviser-initiated advice is enacted in a typical sequence: pre-advising (i.e. making comments, inquiring, etc.), advising, and post-advising (i.e. providing explanations).

Is the choice of mood dependent on newspaper source and weather conditions?\u2022How are interpersonal relationships displayed in advice-giving through the use of addressing terms, such as sh\u00ecm\u00edn and p\u00e9ngy\u01d2u?\n",

The function of optional elements may account for the variations in the texts that belong to the same genre. In this case, a single GSP can generate a large number, or if recursion is involved, an infinite number of actual structures with the variable realisation of each element. In other words, a potentially infinite number of actual texts can occur as exemplars of the same genre. Hasan's GSP allows a systemic and consistent description of generic structures of instances of texts in terms of the elements included. Since some elements may be common to different genres, and the more elements two genres share, the more similar they will be.",

As the two examples in Section 2.2 show, advice-giving can occur in the forecast or the ending, and Example 5 further below illustrates how advice can be incorporated into the overview component of the weather commentaries. Our examples also show that a component can occur more than once in a commentary. As our analysis in Section 3.2 below will show, we found that most of the time the overview and review components are so intertwined that is not always possible to separate them.

For instance, during the disastrous flood on 21 July 2012, which was the worst flood in over 60 years, many of those who were caught in the heavy rain panicked because they had never experienced such a big flood before (Wang et al., 2013b). In addition, the rescue system collapsed. As a result, 79 people in total died in the flood, including a driver who was drowned because he stayed in his car and was subsequently unable to escape, as well as two young university students who chose to swim across a flooded bridge. It is possible that if they had benefitted from professional instructions or advice before the event, they might have stood a better chance at survival.

Our results reveal that weather related advice-giving was abundant, especially during extreme events. In terms of content, the variety of climate facts and the vast reservoir of medical theories on health contributed to a large number of advice themes in the weather commentaries: from ordinary weather to extreme weather, from daily activities to special occasions, from everyday health care to prevention of seasonal diseases.

For Beijing Evening News, we found a similar pattern for the high-status vocative sh\u00ecm\u00edn, where again the journalists utilised this linguistic device to display authority more during extreme events. Beijing Morning Post, on the other hand, showed a clear preference for the equal-status addressing term p\u00e9ngy\u01d2u regardless of the type of weather. While appropriate use of high-status addressing terms can increase the feeling of authority or reliability of advice, the use of equal-status addressing term can add credit to the intimate writer-reader relationship.
