The author discusses the threat of a pandemic in the twenty-first century, comparing a potential pandemic with past flu pandemics as well as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada and parts of Asia. Also discussed are the ways in which influenza would spread, be treated, and hopefully contained. Addressed are the ways in which one becomes ethically prepared for an influenza pandemic, as well as the challenges to incorporating ethical guidelines in preparations. Tong also addresses the role of a duty/obligation/responsibility to work by health care personnel, the role of volunteers, and when health care personnel may refuse to treat someone. Also taken into consideration are such issues as the distribution of food and vaccines, quarantines, work stoppage, both physical and social infrastructure, the role of military and police forces, and the effect of a pandemic, isolation, and quarantine on various industries. Tong shows the complicated nature of working on a task force and the complexity of incorporating ethics into logistical planning.",

I told the NC IOM administrator who contacted me I knew next to nothing about influenza pandemics, including the Avian Flu. She said that my infectious-disease ignorance was of little concern to her; the NC IOM/DPH Task Force would have among its members many public health and safety experts. In addition, there would be representatives from government agencies, health care organizations, businesses, industries, faith communities, and advocacy groups. What the Task Force lacked were ethicists. Specifically, it needed an ethicist to serve as co-Chair together with the Director of the North Carolina Department of Public Health, and I had been identified as a likely candidate for this role.",

Or would it simply want to use ethics as a sweet frosting to lather over a cake of political deals made between special-interests' lobbies? She responded: \"Come to the first meeting. If you do not like the way it goes, you never have to come to another meeting.\" I went to the first meeting of the Task Force; I was very impressed by the sincerity and genuine ethical concern of its members. After that meeting, I agreed to co-Chair the Task Force. During the months that followed, I learned how alternately heartening and disheartening the process of producing a set of guidelines that merit the descriptor \"ethical\" can be. It is not easy to get 37 diverse people to develop and endorse a set of ethical guidelines. On the contrary, it is very hard work!",

Although people in the United States may think that such disease outbreaks are confined mainly to their television screens and disaster films, history teaches that influenza pandemics typically occur three times in a century. In the twentieth century, the three influenza pandemics were the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957 Asian Flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (NC IOM/DPH Task Force 2007 . All were of avian (bird) origin, and the worst of them was the Spanish Flu; worldwide, 50 million people died. In the United States the death toll was 675,000 (Berlinger 2006) . A particularly vexing feature of the Spanish Flu was that it did not strike the populations that annual flus generally hit hardest: the very young and the very old. Instead it targeted people in their twenties and thirties (Engel 2007, 32) . The other two twentiethcentury influenza pandemics (the Asian Flu and the Hong Kong Flu), though not as devastating, were no small matter. The Asian Flu killed 2 million people worldwide, 70,000 of them in the United States; and the Hong Kong Flu killed 700,000 people worldwide, 34,000 of them in the United States (Garloch 2006, A1) .",

But just because the Avian Flu has not visited the United States during the first eight years of the twenty-first century, does not mean it will not. The first human cases were reported in China and Vietnam in 2003. They were four in number, and all were fatal. In 2004, 46 cases were reported in Vietnam and Thailand; of these, 32 were fatal. In 2005, 97 cases were reported in Vietnam, Thailand, China, Cambodia, and Indonesia; 42 were fatal. In 2006, 116 cases were reported in a large range of countries: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, and Turkey. Of these, 80 were fatal (Engel 2007, 34) . To be sure, the Avian Flu has not killed many people to date, and no US citizen has succumbed to its horrors. Yet, according to public health authorities, we are closer now to an influenza pandemic than at anytime since the Asian Flu outbreak in 1968 -1969 (World Health Organization 2007 . When the first influenza pandemic of the 2000s hits it will kill somewhere between 209,000 to 1,903,000 members of the US population (Department of Health and Human Services 2006).",

The situation is quite different with respect to an influenza pandemic, however.

As difficult as it is to get medical systems of command and control, surveillance, vaccine and antiviral production, and health care delivery prepared for a deadly pandemic, it is even more difficult to get ethical codes and guidelines prepared for it. Experience teaches that once an influenza pandemic hits full force, it is too late to formulate ethical codes and guidelines to help citizens meet its distinctive ethical challenges. Accustomed to using ethical guidelines that work well enough in the clinical context, people may discover that the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice need to be interpreted and/or prioritized differently in the public health context. In addition, they may discover that these principles need to be supplemented by ethical principles they rarely, if ever, invoke in the clinical context.

In the aftermath of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada and several Asian nations, members of Toronto's Joint Center for Bioethics drafted a document entitled \"Stand on Guard for Thee: Ethical Considerations for Pandemic Preparedness Planning\" (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Pandemic Influenza Working Group 2005). The phrase \"stand on guard for thee\" occurs in the Canadian national anthem. It signals to Canadians their obligation to be on the lookout for each other's best interests. Whatever befalls one Canadian potentially affects all Canadians. Although Canadians behaved well enough during the SARS crisis, manifesting their traditional communitarian spirit, the drafters of the Stand-on-Guard-for-Thee document felt Canadians would have acted even better had they been ethically as well as medically prepared for SARS. Among the things that went wrong ethically during Canada's SARS experience were: (1) some health care personnel refused to care for people infected with SARS and were subsequently dismissed for failing to report for duty; (2) other health care personnel were socially ostracized or stigmatized because they willingly cared for infected patients (Rhyne 2007, 51) ; (3) some physicians and nurses left their respective professions voluntarily because they did not want to continue in what they had come to regard as a truly life-threatening job (Rhyne 2007, 51) ; (4) some Canadians infected by or exposed to SARS did not comply or fully comply with quarantine restrictions (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005, 12-13); and (5) some Canadians boycotted all Chinese businesses everywhere in Toronto just because the initial case of SARS was linked to an international traveler from China (Yount 2005, 21) .",

The Task Force wanted to explore with her whether the ethical values guiding the Canadian document were exportable to the United States. Dr. Thompson stressed that two interrelated but nonetheless distinct sets of values, one procedural and the other substantive, were embedded in the Stand-on-Guard-for-Thee document. She then identified the procedural values as: (1) reasonability, (2) openness, (3) inclusiveness, (4) responsiveness, and (5) accountability; and the substantive values as: (1) individual liberty, (2) protection of the public from harm, (3) proportionality, (4) privacy, (5) equity, (6) duty to provide care, (7) reciprocity, (8) trust, (9) solidarity, and (10) stewardship (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics 2005, 6-7).",

In addition, they interrogated her about the Toronto team's views on the duty to care as it applied to licensed health care professionals in particular, but to others as well. Did licensed health care professionals really have a duty to risk their own lives in order to serve infected patients? Was this duty professional, contractual, legal, or moral? Did nonlicensed health care professionals have the same or different duties as licensed health care professionals? Did other professionals have the same or different duties as health care professionals? Did families have either a legal or a moral duty to take care of their infected relatives? Was a duty the same as an obligation? A responsibility? Was there a difference between a moral duty/obligation/responsibility and an ethical duty/obligation/responsibility? After Dr. Thompson's visit and nearly two months of sometimes heated, but always careful, discussions the NC IOM/DPH Task Force decided not to embrace the substantive values of solidarity and stewardship. Because some Task Force members associated the substantive value of solidarity with unions and/or socialism/communism, the Task Force as a whole decided to forsake this value as too politically charged. Solidarity does not play as well on North Carolina soil as on Canadian ground. Americans are, on the average, more individualistic and less communal than Canadians; and solidarity with fellow citizens is not as important to Americans as being able to chart the course of their own individual destinies.",

Several Task Force members asserted the term \"duty\" was too strong. To them, the term implied that health care personnel had an ethical duty to care for infected patients. I responded that, as I saw it, at least licensed health care personnel (e.g., physicians and nurses) did indeed have an ethical duty to care for infected patients for three reasons. First, licensed health care professionals have a greater ability than any other segment of the public to provide medical care, a fact that increases their obligation to provide it. Second, licensed health care professionals have a contract with society, resulting from the privilege of self-regulation and self-licensure, that calls on them to be available in times of emergency. Third, licensed health care professionals, by freely choosing a profession devoted to caring for the ill, prima facie accept an ethical obligation to act in the best interests of the ill and to assume a proportional share of the risks to which their profession exposes them (NC IOM/DPH Task Force 2007, 28).",

Some Task Force members claimed that individuals' professional ethics were separate from their personal ethics. As they saw it, a professional duty was less ethically binding than a personal duty. When I asked them why, they had no definite answer. However, I did find plausible the suggestion that because professional duties typically are less linked to one's central self-identity than to personal duties, they may be less ethically binding. Yet even though this suggestion made sense to me, it also made me want to run for cover. Suddenly, I realized the extent to which ethical theory has failed to clearly specify whether professional duties are \"perfect\" or \"imperfect\" in the Kantian sense of these terms. For Kant, a perfect duty is one \"which admits of no exception in the interests of inclination\" (Kant 1964, 96) . In contrast, an imperfect duty is one that must be performed at least sometimes when the opportunity arises. Did licensed health care professionals always have a duty to treat infected patients during an influenza pandemic or could they, with clear conscience, balance their duty to care for infected patients against their duty not to infect others, including themselves under certain circumstances? In answer to my question, one Task Force member noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) Policy E-9.067 Physician Obligation in Disaster Preparedness and Response states:",

Sometimes the Task Force had the fortitude to resolve a moral disagreement relatively quickly. For example, when two Task Force members referred to Ayn Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness (Rand 1964) , claiming that the only moral duty individuals had was the duty to maximize their own self-interest, they were immediately challenged by the majority of Task Force members who claimed either that individuals had moral duties to others or that it was in individuals' self-interest to serve the interests of others. Realizing there was major opposition on the Task Force to Ayn Rand's brand of ethical egoism, her two followers quickly decided it was probably in their own self-interest to soft-pedal their point of view. However, one of them suggested the Task Force reserve the term \"duty\" or \"obligation\" for (1) licensed health care personnel's professional obligation to care for infected patients; and (2) unlicensed as well as licensed health care personnel's contractual obligation to meet the terms of their respective employment agreements. He further suggested that a weaker term like \"responsibility\" be used to refer to everyone else's purported duty/obligation to assist each other in times of need. Although I was not certain I agreed with these two suggestions, I ultimately voted with the rest of the Task Force to accept them as verbal distinctions that probably would not make much of a substantive difference in the Task Force's final report.",

As it considered society's debt to those who serve it in times of crisis, the NC IOM/DPH Task Force repeatedly invoked the value of reciprocity. To its credit, the Task Force was alert to the fact that if health care personnel and other critical workers were asked to fulfill their duties/obligations/responsibilities to society, it was only fair that society express its gratitude to them. Thus, the Task Force insisted that frontline health care personnel and others at increased risk of infection should have priority for protective equipment, antiviral medications, vaccinations, counseling services, and adequate on-the-job training if necessary (NC IOM/DPH 2007, 29-32) . In addition, most, if not all, of the Task Force members insisted that families of frontline health care personnel be given priority for preventive measures and/or curative treatments, so as to increase the likelihood of health care personnel reporting for duty.

My unease increased when several Task Force members recommended that we rely on volunteers during an influenza pandemic. The idea of relying on volunteers is, in the Southeast region of the United States, still enormously popular. The region is characterized by a particularly large number of charitable organizations, many of them church based. A remarkably high number of physicians and other health care personnel volunteer to work at free clinics, respond to medical crises whenever and wherever they occur, and serve desperately ill people in developing nations. Yet, in time of an influenza pandemic, there may be something wrong about relying on volunteers. I asked the Task Force if risk of death should not be distributed equally among all health care personnel, particularly the licensed ones. I noted that during the height of the HIV AIDS crisis, when a sizeable number of physicians and nurses refused to treat infected patients, Abigail Zuger, MD, argued that the American Medical Association (AMA) code of 1847 had it right when it stated: \"When pestilence prevails, it is their duty to face the danger and to continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives\" (Zuger 1987) .

The psychiatrist knows that she must intubate the patient (e.g., insert a breathing tube into the patient's airway) to help him breathe but has concerns because she has not intubated a patient since she was an intern 10 years ago. Should she intubate the patient? Is the risk of him dying greater than the risk of her injuring him while attempting to intubate him? What if something goes wrong?

Schools and day care centers might be asked or required to close (NC IOM/DPH Task Force 2007, 41-42).

If their workplace was open and they needed the money to pay their bills, people would drag themselves to work. Many members of the public suggested that the only sure ways to prevent this state of affairs would be to force workplaces to close or to pay workers to stay home. Of course, the wisdom of the state actually implementing either of these suggestions is highly questionable. The former suggestion might be financially devastating for many businesses, and the latter only marginally less so. Businesses could ask the government to provide them with funds to mitigate their major financial hits, but whether the government could do this without jeopardizing the economy as a whole is an open question.

They also expressed willingness to keep their children home from school and to tend the sick in their own homes, provided their families' basic needs were met and they received adequate instructions and supplies for tending their infected loved ones and themselves. Once again, the NC IOM/DPH Task Force was sobered by the fact that during an influenza pandemic, so much would depend on society having well-developed systems to meet people's basic needs and on having adequate reservoirs of community goodwill and public service at hand. But did North Carolina have such systems and reservoirs? Was it realistic, for example, to expect family members to care for their infected relatives? Maybe. But studies indicate that many people would prefer their families not take care of them if they fall victim to an influenza pandemic. Should such studies prove to be true, who would take care of these people and where? Health care facilities would be without enough beds, and thoughts of housing infected people in Superdome-type quarters are frightening. Should people be housed in schools? In churches? In fitness centers? Who should staff these facilities? What about people for whom no one seems to care? As usual, I asked myself why is it that society creates task forces to meet all people's, but especially vulnerable people's, needs during an influenza pandemic or subsequent to a major natural disaster, when that same society ignores and/or neglects meeting vulnerable people's needs in relatively good times? Why is care reserved for moments of crisis? As much as I wanted to pose these fundamental questions to the Task Force, I knew they would serve only to sidetrack it. I held my tongue and focused on the Band-Aid at hand.",

In an effort to avoid wasting time, the Task Force read the results of the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) 2005 Public Engagement Pilot Program on Pandemic Influenza (PEPPPI) project. The leaders of this project wanted to ascertain the general public's views on distributing scarce vaccine during an influenza pandemic. They asked citizens to rank order the following ethical guidelines for distributing scarce vaccine fairly:",

            "text": "[W]ith a very high level of agreement-that assuring the functioning of society should be the first immunization goal followed in importance by reducing the individual deaths and hospitalizations due to influenza (i.e. protecting those who are most at risk). Because of the still high importance of the second goal, the groups added that the first goal should be achieved using the minimum number of vaccine doses required to assure that function. This would allow the remaining doses to be used as soon as possible for those at highest risk of death or hospitalization. There was little support for other suggested goals to vaccinate young people first, to use a lottery system, or a first come first served approach as top priorities. (Public Engagement Pilot Program on Pandemic Influenza 2005, 7) Although the NC IOM/DPH Task Force learned much from the PEPPI report, it felt it had not learned enough. The Task Force wanted to establish ethical guidelines for a wide range of scarce medical resources. Vaccines would not be the only scarce medical resource in an influenza pandemic. So too would be antiviral medicines, ventilators, hospital and nursing home beds, masks, and health care professionals' time. Complicating the Task Force's allocation deliberations was the empirical fact that during an influenza pandemic priorities inevitably shift depending on whether prevention of disease (early stages) or treatment of disease (later stages) is central. Thus, the Task Force would need at least two sets of allocation guidelines: one for healthy people who needed vaccines and other preventive measures in order not to get sick; and another for sick people who needed treatment.",

Priority should be given to reduce illness, hospitalizations, and death due to the influenza. 4. Priority should be given to protect people with the most years of life ahead of them. 5. There should be no priority given for the distribution of limited health care resources to ensure that everyone has an equal chance of being protected. (NC IOM/DPH Task Force 2007, 49-50) Although most of the Task Force wanted to limit its deliberations to the five possible allocation criteria listed above, at least one member of the Task Force wanted to add Ezekiel J. Emanuel's allocation criterion of \"quality of life years left or the life cycle principle\" (Emanuel and Wertheimer 2006, 854) . The idea behind this criterion is that \"each person should have an opportunity to live through all the stages of life,\" with priority given to young adults over young children (around one year old, say). Emanuel's reasoning for favoring young adults over young children is that young adults supposedly have more developed interests, hopes, and plans than young children, but like young children have not had an opportunity to realize them (Ibid). In other words, young adults have consciously articulated to themselves their school, career, marriage, and family plans, whereas young children have not. Thus, dying during an influenza pandemic would entail more suffering for a young adult than a young child. For all the merits of Emanuel's criterion, the objection can be raised that if a young child survives an influenza pandemic, he/she will probably live to be a young adult with the kind of plans noted above. Moreover, given the fact that people are living ever longer and healthier lives, who is to say that a 40, 50, 60, 70, or even 80-year-old has had a chance to realize their hopes and interests? What if someone wasted the first 40 years of his or her life and wanted to use the next 40 years or so to make up for their wasted years? Why should his or her plans count less than a young adult's plans? If it adopted Emanuel's criterion, would the Task Force be perceived as ageist? To be sure, Task Force members thought that during an influenza pandemic many grandparents would willingly sacrifice their lives for the lives of their grandchildren, but this sentiment was captured in the less controversial principle that priority should be given to protect people with the most years of life ahead of them. Without the Emanuel principle ever coming to a vote, it gradually disappeared from the Task Force's radar screen, resurfacing as a \"mention-only\" in the Task Force's final report (NC IOM/DPH 2007, 50, footnote c) .",

Therefore, said the Task Force, many sorts of unfairnesses built into the \"first-come, first-served\" criterion, beginning with the fact that not everyone has the means to get to a vaccine-delivery location. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, for example, it became clear that many of the people left behind did not have the transportation or help to flee.

Neither absolute adherence to principles, nor relativistic acceptance of all \"moral\" views, is likely to result in a set of ethical guidelines that most people in a highly diverse society can accept as substantially their own. Rather, any such set of ethical guidelines is likely to be built \"taxonomically, taking one difficult class of cases at a time and comparing it in detail with other clearer and easier classes of cases\" (Toulmin 1981, 31) . The NC IOM/DPH Task Force stalled when it tried to agree on abstract definitions of terms like \"duty,\" \"obligation,\" and \"responsibility,\" but it made substantial progress as soon as Task Force members began to share cases in which it was clear to them, for example, that a physician had a duty/obligation/responsibility to work and cases in which it was not clear. By comparing and contrasting clear and unclear cases, the Task Force was able to write ethical guidelines that, in its collective estimation, would help decisionmakers handle, fairly and compassionately, all but the hardest cases-the kind of cases which tragically result in someone or some group being harmed despite everyone's best intensions and efforts to avoid this state of affairs. I left my role as co-Chair of the NC IOM/DPH Task Force convinced that when an influenza pandemic arrives, the kind of ethics most likely to persuade people to do their duty and more is not a rights-based, duties-based, or utility-based ethics, but a care-based ethics. We human beings are a very vulnerable lot. We are radically dependent on each other for survival and we need to view ourselves as folks in a lifeboat in the middle or the ocean with no visible sign of rescue. If there aren't enough supplies to go around until help arrives, we can do several things: we can ask for volunteers to jump off the boat; we can start drawing straws for who gets pushed off the boat; we can have a majority vote about which lives are most dispensable; or we can look in each others' eyes and see ourselves-fearful, hopeful, and in need of compassion. Then start paddling together to get to shore, knowing that although we might not all make it, we did not turn on each other in our panic. What we need most to weather a pandemic is an ethics of trust, reciprocity, and solidarity. If we have that, we will have the most precious health care resource of all.",
