            "text": "Astroviruses are small single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses of approximately 28\u201330 nm in diameter belonging to the family Astroviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005). These round star-shaped viruses have been detected in many species of birds (genus Avastrovirus) and mammals (genus Mamastrovirus), including humans. Generally, astrovirus infections in animals are associated with enteric diseases, with mild to severe signs such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sometimes associated with fever and immunodepression (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005). In some cases, astroviruses can cause extra-enteric infections, as is the case of the avian nephritis virus (AVN), known to cause interstitial nephritis and growth retardation of young chickens (Imada et al., 2000) and the duck astrovirus (DAstV), that cause severe hepatitis and mortality rates up to 50% in ducklings (Gough et al., 1984). Some astroviruses do not cause a detectable disease: the bovine astrovirus (BAstV) is asymptomatic or induces only slight changes in faeces of experimentally infected calves (Bridger et al., 1984) and the feline astrovirus (FAstV) cause disease only occasionally (Marshall et al., 1984b). In other instances, the association of astroviruses with diseases is simply unknown, as the case of the recently discovered astroviruses in insectivorous bats (Chu et al., 2008). The most well characterized astroviruses are those that infect humans (HAstVs). They are classified in eight different serotypes, HAstV-1 to HAstV-8 (Walter and Mitchell, 2003) and HAstV-1 appears to be the most common, in particular among children, elderly and immunocompromised persons (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005, Walter and Mitchell, 2003).",

However, the previous studies observations were based on electron microscopy only and their presence in canine faeces had never been confirmed by genetic or antigenic analysis. It is noteworthy that electron microscopy often leads to wrong classification of small viral particles since they share similar morphological and physiochemical features (Guy et al., 2004). In the above-mentioned reports, astroviruses were detected in symptomatic puppies, associated with other enteric viruses such as parvoviruses, rotaviruses and coronaviruses.",

A final elongation step at 68 \u00b0C for 5 min was performed, followed by chilling to 8 \u00b0C. The PCR products obtained from this amplification were sequenced and, based on these preliminary results, new canine astrovirus specific forward primer could be designed about 60 nt downstream the YGDD-motif, HundAstroF2800 (5\u2032-GAT GTT TTT GGA ATG TGG GT-3\u2032), to allow for a more specific amplification. A new dog long-range cDNA was then successfully amplified using this primer (0.5 \u03bcM) as a forward primer towards s2m-rev in a similar amplification as described above using BD Advantage 2 Poymerase, but the annealing temperature was decreased to 55 \u00b0C. The new-amplified PCR products were then sequenced, and new primers were designed and used for sequencing of this PCR product in a primer-walking strategy.",

The canine astrovirus genome, however, displayed the very conserved region right upstream of the Mamastrovirus-homologous start codon, that could be involved in subgenomic RNA transcription (Jonassen et al., 2003), and it is therefore not clear if a subgenomic RNA spanning the first initiation codon is synthesised.
