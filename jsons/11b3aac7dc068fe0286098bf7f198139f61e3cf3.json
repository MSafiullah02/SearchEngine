The 1918 Spanish influenza revolutionized public health with the emergence of health ministries, disease reporting, and national health surveys. Medical experience gleaned during World War I coincided with developments of blood typing and refrigeration leading to the advent of blood banking, a process that has impacted tens of millions of lives. During the Korean War, MASH surgeons pioneered direct arterial repair for limb preservation in solders, reducing significantly the number of required amputations. 1 At present, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed gaps in public health infrastructure and health system capacity in addition to disparities in resource allocation. These deficiencies will undoubtedly bring future changes in governance and disaster-preparedness legislation. Currently, however, this challenging time has promoted novel approaches to healthcare delivery in addition to the rapid incorporation technology. Telehealth, in the setting of mandated social distancing and restrictions on non-essential cases and clinic visits, has stolen the spotlight.",

Among the earliest uses of telemedicine was the evaluation of patients with stroke for thrombolysis candidacy. 2 Applications have continued to expand to include neuro-trauma, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke rehabilitation, and chronic pain among others. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Advantages There are innumerable potential advantages of continuing to expand this model of healthcare delivery. The major benefit is the ability to overcome geographic and socioeconomic barriers to elective and emergency subspecialty care. The use of telehealth systems increases access for patient populations who reside in rural areas, do not have the means to travel or afford childcare, do not have the economic means to miss work, or have decision makers who cannot physically be present. It provides subspecialty services between or within hospital systems that do not or cannot independently support a team of neurosurgeons at all hospital sites. It also allows for the consolidation of neurosurgical care at facilities with experience and streamlined workflows.",

With all emerging technologies, questions of cost, quality, liability, ethics, implementation, regulations, and financial compensation must be considered. Currently healthcare delivery systems contain a patchwork of siloed health information systems with underutilized or cumbersome health information exchange networks. Ensuring the safe and complete transmission of a patient's record between systems can be challenging for information technology departments and care providers. Cost and administrative challenges are a significant barrier to multi-state telehealth licensure.

The waivers loosen restrictions on prior authorization requirements, relax enrollment requirements to expand provider inter-state availability, and facilitate reimbursement for care in alternative settings. Alternative settings for telehealth include the permitted use of Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger video chat, and Apple FaceTime. The Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights issued a Notification of Enforcement Discretion enabling health care providers to use the above modalities without the risk of penalties imposed by the office for HIPAA violations. 13 But a post-pandemic contraction is likely to occur with less lenient regulations and a return to secure and HIPAA compliant platforms.",
