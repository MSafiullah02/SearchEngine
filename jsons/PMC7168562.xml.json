            "text": "Swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) was first identified in South China in January 2017 as a disease causing high mortality in neonatal piglets (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). It is quickly demonstrated that the causative agent of SADS is a novel HKU2\u2010related coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS\u2010CoV) which originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), but the mechanism of transmission of bat\u2010originated coronavirus in pigs needs further illumination (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Based on the analysis of genomes, SADS\u2010CoV is classified into the genus Alphacoronavirus within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). So far, besides porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), SADS\u2010CoV is the fourth porcine enteric coronavirus that circulated in pigs in China (Dong et al., 2015; Xuan et al., 1984). A retrospective investigation showed that SADS\u2010CoV emerged in China at least since August 2016 (Zhou et al., 2019). Li et al. (2018) reported one SADS\u2010CoV strain that was isolated from fecal and small intestinal samples collected from Fujian province and suggested that SADS\u2010CoV might have spread from Guangdong to Fujian province.",

            "text": "In the first outbreak of SADS\u2010CoV occurring between January and May 2017, in order to reduce mortality in suckling pigs, the minced intestines from acutely infected piglets were filtered, centrifuged and inactivated before feeding back to pregnant sows to allow maternal antibodies to be obtained in neonatal piglets. Hence, after May 2017, the epidemic was controlled. And with a period of quiescence, SADS\u2010CoV seemed to have disappeared from pig herds in South China. While on February 2019, there was a large\u2010scale outbreak of approximately 2000 piglets dying of diarrhoea in one farm, which was near the origin of the SADS pandemic in 2017. The extensive aetiological investigation for common swine viruses suggested that the causative agent of this recent diarrhoea outbreak was SADS\u2010CoV. In this study, we compared the infections of piglets with the original and re\u2010emerging SADS\u2010CoV strains by clinical signs, epidemiological investigation, serological investigation and phylogenetic analysis. The results highlight the significance of SADS\u2010CoV and the disease it causes.",

            "text": "At the beginning of the latest outbreak on February 2019, infected suckling piglets developed acute diarrhoea, vomiting and died after 2\u20136 days of the diarrhoea, which were consistent with the clinical signs reported in SAD\u2010CoV outbreaking farms (Zhou et al., 2018). Two weeks after the onset, mortality did not increase due to the effective inactivated SADS\u2010CoV vaccine which was propagated in vitro (data unpublished). Clinical small intestine samples were collected rapidly from piglets, and intestinal samples were homogenized, centrifuged and filtered for virus isolate. Viral nucleic acid was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The potential swine viral pathogens were examined, including SADS\u2010CoV, PEDV, PDCoV, porcine rotavirus (RV), TGEV, reovirus (REO), senecavirus A (SVA), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parainfluenza virus 1 (PPIV1), swine influenza virus (SIV), atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), haemophilus parasuis (HPS), hog cholera (HC), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV), porcine sapelovirus (PSV) and porcine kobuvirus (PKV) by PCR or RT\u2010PCR following the established protocol of Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control. The extensive aetiological investigations for common swine viruses showed that only SADS\u2010CoV was detected positively, which suggested that the causative agent of the most recent diarrhoea outbreak on February was SADS\u2010CoV.",

            "text": "Furthermore, a total of 18 blood samples were simultaneously collected from healthy sows for serological investigation. Sera samples were obtained after coagulation and centrifugation (2,000 g, 10 min) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until ELISA implemented. The PEDV antibody production was detected by means of commercial ELISA test kit (ZhenRui, China), of which, sample S/P ratios with \u22650.4 were considered positive and <0.4 were considered negative. And for SADS\u2010CoV, ELISA was conducted following the modified procedures established in Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control (P/N \u2265 2.1 considered positive). The absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was measured (Multiskan\u2122 FC, Thermo Fisher). The results of ELISA assay revealed that all sera (100%) were negative for the PEDV and 13 of 18 (72.2%) were positive for SADS\u2010CoV (Figure 1). In our previously clinical investigations, PEDV had caused prior outbreaks at most farms with SADS\u2010CoV outbreaks (Zhou et al., 2018). It is possible that the presence of PEDV antibody may have somehow facilitated the amplification of the SADS\u2010CoV. However, our results showed that PEDV antibodies were undetectable in all SADS\u2010CoV antibody\u2010positive sera samples, suggesting that it is SADS\u2010CoV that caused the lethal infection in pigs on February 2019. Collectively, the re\u2010emergence of SADS\u2010CoV in pig herds in South China was confirmed by ELISA test and the association between PEDV and SADS\u2010CoV infection requires further validation.",

            "text": "Subsequently, one SADS\u2010CoV genome was amplified as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019). The novel SADS\u2010CoV strain was named as SADS\u2010CoV/CN/GDLX/2019 (accession number: MK651076). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed with Lasergene coresuite 10 (DNASTAR lnc.). Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour\u2010joining method with MEGA 7.0 software (Kumar, Stecher, & Tamura, 2016). Bootstrap analysis was carried out on 1,000 replicate data sets (Felsenstein, 1985). For the whole genomes, sequence alignment results revealed that the nucleotide identities between SADS\u2010CoV/CN/GDLX/2019 and previously reported SADS\u2010CoV strains ranged from 99.3% to 100%. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree indicated that the novel SADS\u2010CoV complete genome clustered together with other reported SADS\u2010CoV strains and located in the Alpha coronavirus branch (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis based on S genes was also conducted, and the result showed that all SADS\u2010CoV, bat HKU2 and BtRf\u2010AlphaCoV strains were separated from other AlphaCoVs and clustered within BetaCoVs (Figure 3), which is consistent with previous studies (Pan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Notably, the S gene of SADS\u2010CoV/CN/GDLX/2019 had high identities of 99.2%\u201399.9% with other SADS\u2010CoV strains detected in Guangdong and lowest identities of 97.5% with SADS\u2010CoV\u2010CH\u2010FJWT\u20102018 reported from Fujian. Additionally, the comparative analysis of amino acids encoded by S gene revealed that the S protein of the novel strain had a two\u2010amino\u2010acid mutation (F306 and I882) compared with that of other SADS\u2010CoV strains. It is well known that the S protein of coronavirus play an important role in cellular entry and determining the immunogenicity (Li, Frank, He, Peter, & Berend\u2010Jan, 2016). In view of the lowest identities of Spike gene between the strains from Guangdong and Fujian, continuous monitoring of SADS\u2010CoV genetic evolution is important for better understanding its epidemiology and establishing efficient strategies against its further circulating in pigs in China.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genomes showed that SADS\u2010CoV/CN/GDLX/2019 shared high nucleotide identities with previously reported SADS\u2010CoV strains. Taken together, our study highlighted the significant threat of SADS\u2010CoV and the potential outbreak of SADS epidemic in following months in Guangdong.
