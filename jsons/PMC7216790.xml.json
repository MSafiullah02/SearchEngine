There have been many infections and related problems on ships worldwide such as the Grand Princess (United States) [2], the Ruby Princess and Ovation of the Seas (Australia), and Costa Luminosa (France). Japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and all passengers including asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by using reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); valuable lessons can be learned from the steps taken for quarantine implementation on the cruise ship. The Diamond Princess had 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board, and the average age of passengers was 66.0 years [3]. The ship left Yokohama Port on January 20, 2020. A passenger who disembarked from the ship in Hong Kong on January 25 developed a fever on January 30. This passenger was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 on February 1. The ship arrived at Yokohama earlier than scheduled on February 3, at which time the quarantine began [3].",

In addition to scheduling transportation, we arranged for emergency transportation of people whose symptoms worsened.

There was no reward for the research participants, since there are no economic interests that affect the research results. This research paper was approved by the ethics committee of Yodogawa Christian Hospital (Approved No 2020-006). RT-PCR tests were performed for all 3711 passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess; 696 (18.8%) passengers tested positive, of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic (Figure 1, Table 1). As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of those with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized with a ventilator or in intensive care units, and 7 patients (1.0% of those with positive RT-PCR results) had died (Figure 2) [4,5]. We transported asymptomatic people to the quarantine location. The criteria for \u201casymptomatic\u201d status were no fever (body temperature <37.5 \u00b0C/99.5 \u00b0F as measured by an axillary thermometer), with an SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) of 97% or above as measured with a pulse oximeter in room air. Of the 128 people who were transported, 75% (n=96) had positive RT-PCR results while on board the ship. Of the asymptomatic people with RT-PCR\u2013positive results, 13.5% (n=13) required medical intervention after being transported from the ship and were transferred from the quarantine location to a hospital within 24 hours of arrival.",

The situation necessitated onboard quarantine with complete inspection and isolation of RT-PCR\u2013positive persons. Additionally, today\u2019s cruise ships are huge. The Diamond Princess had 3706 people on board, including 2706 passengers of many nationalities. The ship began service in 2004; it is 290 meters (951.4 feet) long and 37.5 meters (123.0 feet) wide, with 18 floors [9]. Each room has a toilet and shower. The high-class rooms are large and have balconies. As the class level decreases, the area of the rooms becomes smaller and the rooms are located on lower floors. The lowest class rooms are interior rooms with no windows. Crew rooms are even smaller and have limited personal space. All large cruise ships have many rooms with narrow corridors, and many people gather in small spaces, such as restaurants, theaters, and casinos. The Diamond Princess was anchored at Daikoku Wharf (Yokohama City) and berthed at the quay (Figure 3). The ship has three elevator halls: one near the bow, one near the center, and one near the stern. The opening at the stern is used only for carrying supplies, so we could only use 2 elevators to enter. From the outside of the ship, we passed through a narrow passageway and entered the ship from the opening near the center (Figure 4). Then, we passed through a security check and reached the elevator hall in front of the medical center.",

The possibility of airborne infection was also raised. At the beginning of implementation of the quarantine, we had to enact measures based on limited information, which is confusing. In general, when we do not have the exact information, we have to consider the maximum risk possible. During the quarantine of the Diamond Princess, a lot of new information about COVID-19 in China was published; hence, we had to change our practice and attitude accordingly. There might be a gap between the new and old infection control measures.",

The Kanagawa Prefectural Government and its supporting DMAT were in charge of contacting the hospital to be used as the isolation facility, making inquiries about acceptance, deciding who would be placed in which facility, and securing vehicles for their transport. The DMAT command center, located at the terminal of the Daikoku Wharf, was in charge of deciding which vehicles would be used to transport the RT-PCR\u2013positive patients. The onboard medical headquarters was in charge of checking the medical condition of the people who would disembark and of supporting them to the entrance at the center of the ship. The DMAT at the entrance of the ship was in charge of checking the preparation of the vehicles and their destination and ensuring correct transportation.",

However, all the beds in Kanagawa Prefecture were soon filled, and we had to extend transportation to other places in the Kanto region. At the same time, the Japanese government was operating facilities for health observation and quarantine for people who were returning to Japan on flights from Hubei Province. We had to expand the transportation area to Fukushima, Nagano, and even Osaka, which is a 6-hour drive from the ship. On the peak day, we had new 99 RT-PCR\u2013positive patients, and we had to transport family members separately, even though they should have stayed in the same facility. We could not send all family members to the same quarantine place at that time. The Fujita Medical University Okazaki Medical Center offered to accept 170 asymptomatic patients. Since this facility was still in preparation to open as a hospital in April 2020, it was intended to only accept patients who would require no medical treatment. The author was dispatched as a DMAT for logistic support at Okazaki Medical Center and was in charge of ensuring bus transportation, room allocation, arrival confirmation, advice on the transfer to a medical facility, and overall reception. Since the patient lists were sent to the quarantine facility from Yokohama headquarters in advance, we finished the allocation of the name, ID, and room before the arrival of the bus. At the quarantine building, the transport bus was attached to the front entrance, the staff first carried their baggage to the entrance hall, and then the passengers got off the bus. We checked their body temperature and SpO2 levels while their baggage was picked up and patients were registered. We took face photos and attached the ID registration wristband in the allocated room (Figure 5).",

The crew dining area was considered the primary area of infection for the crew, since the food service had the most confirmed cases [13]. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers for infection control. In addition, a lot of water is necessary for human life and a lot of sewage was generated. In the beginning, we left the pier to the open ocean offshore once every few days for sewage disposal, but in the latter half of the quarantine period, the government and municipalities facilitated drinking water delivery and sewage water collection while the ship was still alongside the pier. Leaving the pier also became a barrier to the patients' transportation.",

The deterioration of patients with COVID-19 is very fast, suggesting that authorities need to prepare for patients\u2019 transfer and the admitting hospital when disembarking the passengers. There were several difficulties on the cruise ship, such as securing traffic lines, coordinating accepting facilities and transport means, risk of deterioration, the complex transporting process on the ship, and support for daily life on the ship.
