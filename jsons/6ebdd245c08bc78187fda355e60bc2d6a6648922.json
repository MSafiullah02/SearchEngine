Nonetheless, off-label applications are still frequent and relate to different neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. More recently, two main ongoing studies (CARE-MS I, CARE-MS II) have evaluated the efficacy on multiple sclerosis (MS), and a new application of alemtuzumab, under the name of Lemtrada, has been submitted during 2012 to FDA (accepted for review in January 2013) and to EMEA.",

In the bone marrow, lymphoid progenitors stain strongly with alemtuzumab, while uncommitted and myeloid-committed progenitors are weakly positive. Erythrocytes and platelets are negative. In other non-hemopoietic tissues, relevant binding is present on cutaneous dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. Additional positivity was also encountered in lymphoid primary and secondary organs, and on some male sexual organs (epididymis, seminal vesicles) and mature sperm cells. In lymph nodes the germinal centers stain weakly. These bindings were considered Fab-specific. However, non-specific Fc binding was also detected in a wide range of organs and tissues. An average expression of 5910 5 CD52 molecules/cell has been reported for lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is an IgG1k anti-CD52 humanized monoclonal antibody binding to CD52 cell surface nonmodulating glycoprotein. Upon binding, there is a profound depletion of CD52+ cells. A transient loss of CD52 cell expression was also observed during treatment. In a study sub-group included in the CAM307 trial, 2/139 patients reported a complete loss of CD52, which recovered in both cases prior to disease relapse. Therefore, unstable negative clones seem to be produced by this treatment.",

The first is considered the most relevant effector function in vivo. Other actions such as opsonization, T cell activation, cytokine release, non-specific complement activation, and induction of T cell anti-tumor activity are considered less relevant for the specific therapeutic action, but may be important for AEs induction. With this respect, some pharmacokinetic aspects of alemtuzumab accumulation and clearance are important as well. The latter was shown to be nonlinear and dependent on the amount of CD52+ cells (i.e. tumor burden). Hence, the half-life increases with dosing, due to saturation of clearance pathways and progressive reduction of tumor mass capturing the mAb. Therefore, the specific mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of alemtuzumab are crucial for AEs typology and expression not only during treatment, but also for a wide posttreatment phase, due to the mAb long lasting activity [7, 8] .",

Therefore, the immunoreactivity against alemtuzumab is expected to be relatively low. In fact, the raise of anti-alemtuzumab antibodies has been estimated either in first (8 %) or in second-line (2 %) B-CLL therapy, and appears to be not relevant for AEs induction. The production of neutralizing antibodies is usually a minor fraction and seems not to be involved in the generation of AEs, as well. However, a higher response (30-50 %) was observed in RA patients, mainly when treated with SC injections. Noteworthy, such route of administration is known to produce more effective sensitizations to antigens, possibly due to a better concentration and presentation by Langerhans cells to T lymphocytes in the local environment. Moreover, in other experiences, SC administration gave a lower rate of response, which was attributed to a more effective induction of anti-mAb response [9, 10].",

Opportunistic infections are also frequent (17-43 %) and include pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), aspergillus, HZV, CMV, candidiasis, mucomycosis, and JC virus reactivation (PML) [5, 13] . Since the immunosuppressive effect is not strictly dose-dependent, infection may appear at any stage of treatment and posttreatment, with repeated episodes of different etiology. CMV reactivation and subsequent infections have been followed with particular interest in these patients. CMV viremia was found to be as high as 66 %, and consequent infections appeared to be surprisingly higher (16 %) in naive patients than in previously treated ones (6-8 %) . However, in protocols applied to untreated subjects, CMV detection and infectivity reporting were mandatory, while in other pivotal studies they were mostly recorded only when classified as serious. In fact, when only serious events were compared, the incidence in the two groups was similar [3, 5, 6] . It must be stressed that, as it happens for symptomatic premedication of infusion reactions, the potential sensitivity to infections is likely to be in part masked by routine anti-microbial prophylaxis. Remarkably, more than 70 % of all infections remained of unknown etiology in most studies. Overall, their average rate was estimated to be over 1.8 infections/patient. In SC treatments, rates of CMV and non-CMV infections were similar [12] .",

In particular, it derives from the profound and prolonged lymphopenia induced by alemtuzumab. A massive destruction of T cells is present in almost 100 % of cases, producing a rapid and abundant release of cytokines that are mainly responsible of the acute infusion reaction, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and of similar systemic syndromes (see Chap. 3). The profound lymphopenia impairs the immune resistance to infections, including the opportunistic ones, while the rapid destruction of the neoplastic cell burden (mainly represented by malignant B lymphocytes) causes the nephrotoxic TLS. Therefore, these AEs are strictly related to the specific action of adalimumab, and theoretically are difficult to be avoided. However, they can be mitigated through different strategies, such as premedication and anti-microbial prophylaxis (for infusion reactions and infections, respectively), or administration rules (subcutaneous injection; dose-graduation; tumor burden pre-reduction) to globally reduce their overall negative impact. Finally, a peculiar risk of severe and profound lymphopenia is related to potential transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD), usually avoided by the previous radiation of transfused material [14] .",

At present, five ongoing trials have enrolled 185 patients, while previous experiences have been recently reviewed [18] . In a previous report on eight single arm studies [19] , poor results were associated with a high risk of AEs. Most common encountered AEs were serious thrombocytopenia 32 %, serious neutropenia 17 %, infections 25 %, and mild infusion reactions. However, more recent reports experiencing alemtuzumab as single agent have showed more encouraging results and reduced AEs rates [20] . About 50 % of these patients were naive T-PLL; nine of them had been previously treated in a study of the same group investigating IV vs. SC routes. Although the latter induced less AEs, the former method was chosen on the basis of clinical response. Nonetheless, it was found that infections were lower (10 %) in these patients than in CLL (40 %) cured by the same institution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis and symptomatic premedications respectively reduced opportunistic infections and infusion reactions. They also showed that debulking strategies to reduce tumor burden were not advisable, because of the increase in hematotoxicity.",

However, other EBVrelated lymphomas (HL, BKL) are not associated with hemophagocytosis. EBV reactivation and induction of lymphoproliferative diseases has been also encountered in these patients after months from the end of therapy, as it happens also with other immunosuppressive therapies, in kidney transplant recipients treated with alemtuzumab. Therefore, despite this anti-CD52 mAb is expected to destroy also EBV+ B cells, the subsequent imbalance in reconstitution of various lymphocyte cell classes may result in a new outbreak of EBV+ cells, more prone to proliferate in the absence of fully operative immunosurveillance [22] . In conclusion, particularly severe pancytopenia associated with hemophagocytosis, and viral reactivations may represent additional specific signals of alemtuzumab treatment in T cell lymphoma patients, apparently developing hematotoxic secondary effects, due to additional mechanisms of action.",

A genetic propensity to develop autoimmunity, the unbalanced lymphocyte reconstitution after HSCT, and the combination of such status with the mAb-dependent lymphocyte depletion seem to act as powerful inducers of sAID, even when the primary autoimmune disease seems to be controlled by therapy. In fact, all but one of these patients developed sAID despite achieving remission of the primary autoimmune disease. With this respect, a prolonged lymphocyte depression induced by alemtuzumab and a delayed T cell reconstitution compared to B cells, both induced by HSCT and mAb treatments, may facilitate the appearance of uncontrolled new auto-reactive clones. Since alemtuzumab also affects dendritic cells, monocytes, and in part NK cells (all sharing the CD52 targeted antigen), such profound immune dysregulation may greatly enforce the possibility of developing new and even rare autoimmune disorders. Noteworthy, when employed in the absence of HSCT, such as in solid organ transplantation (see below), the frequency of sAID related to alemtuzumab was not particularly evident, thus indicating a peculiar synergistic effect of HSCT and alemtuzumab treatment in inducing autoimmune disturbances, especially in genetically ''autoimmune-prone'' patients.",

Four early trials and a number of studies have not definitively assessed a positive risk/benefit, but off-label occasional applications are still on course. AEs were similar to those experienced in other autoimmune diseases, with opportunistic leading infections. These studies constantly signaled a profound and long lasting lymphocyte depletion with unbalanced reconstitution of T and B cell compartments and of CD4/CD8 T cell subsets, as observed in the previously mentioned disorders. Therefore, the major concern relates to the long-term potential consequences of such dysregulation in the immune system. Interestingly, sAID observed after the administration of alemtuzumab are predominantly antibody-mediated, and they respond to B cell depletion therapies. Similar features have been also observed after HSTC. Possibly, the RA model may fit better then other pathologies to evaluate long lasting consequences of a drug-induced unbalanced immune system.",

Within the former set, naive and central memory subsets were reduced, while effector memory CD4+ cells seemed unaffected. A similar subsets pattern was observed for CD8+ cells. Total B cell levels were comparable to controls, except for the CD5+ subset, which was significantly reduced. Immunoglobulin levels and response to vaccines were within the range of controls. The role of CD5+ B cells is still under investigation and may be related to autoimmune disorders. In the case of RA, a low rate of autoimmune disorders seems to correlate with the reduction of this subset. However, a good response to vaccines and a low rate of infections in these patients suggest a reasonable reconstitution of immune reactivity even in the presence of persistent imbalance of some T and B cell subsets.",

Interestingly, the imbalance of T lymphocytes during reconstitution was different in MS and RA treated patients.

Rapid, profound, and long lasting cytopenia, mainly as lymphopenia, is the pivotal cause of infusion reactions and infections, to be considered the main expression of drug-related adverse events.

Although particularly violent and aggressive in a minority of cases, most AEs have shown to be manageable and in part preventable through accurate symptomatic pre-medication and anti-microbial prophylaxis. T cell destruction and imbalanced post-treatment reconstitution are respectively considered responsible for early acute cytokine-mediated reactions such as infusion reactions and CRS, and for secondary delayed interventions such as sAID related to improper reconstitution of B and T cell compartments. As for sAID insurgence, two pathogenetic mechanisms have been evoked. The first relates to a genetically determined abnormal production of IL-21, a potent inducer of T cell apoptosis and cell cycling, in some subjects detectable even before treatment [37] . The second observation relates to the kinetics of the lymphocytes compartment's reconstitution, which can be delayed and incomplete up until 12 years after treatment, with anticipated reappearance of some B cells (except for CD5+ subset) followed by CD8+ T cells, and a persistent scarcity of CD4+ lymphocytes. Altogether, they seem to establish a situation particularly favorable to let autoreactive B cell clones appear and expand [33] .",

A number of therapeutic uses have been experienced, both in neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases, either in studies or in current clinical care. Alemtuzumab has been mainly employed in non-B CLL, T-PLL, ALL, TCL, and pTCL. Non-neoplastic experiences are reported in in hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), immunosuppression, renal transplant, bone marrow conditioning, and various autoimmune disorders, including MS. The latter indication is currently under evaluation from FDA and EMEA, on the basis of efficacy and safety data collected in two trials (CARE-MS I; CARE-MS II).",
