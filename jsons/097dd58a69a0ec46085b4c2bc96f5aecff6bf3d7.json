These functions are not discussed in detail in the current review, but they may be mentioned when they are germane to the discussion. Also, the functions of melatonin in plants [18, 61, 62, 194] are not considered even though",

Given the critical role of mitochondria in normal and pathological cellular function, the localization of melatonin in this organelle has broad implications for organ health and organismal well-being. For example, apoptosis and autophagy are important cellular processes that determine tissue architecture and organ physiology. Additional processes considered in this review are the role of melatonin in the regulation of epigenetics and of ubiquitin and proteasomal function. Finally, excessive deposits of collagen and extracellular matrix, accumulations collectively referred to as fibrosis, is a reflection of dysregulated cellular function which has severe negative consequences in a number of organs required for survival. This article by no means exhausts the large number of interactions melatonin has at the subcellular level. ",

What was initially reported was that melatonin preserved the activities of mitochondrial complex I and IV in rats treated with the mitochondrial toxin, ruthenium red [153] ; this toxin hinders the function of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter which leads to the excessive production of damaging free radicals in these organelles. When toxin-treated animals were also given melatonin, but not when they were treated with either vitamin E or vitamin C, the activities of the complexes were preserved; the toxin in this case was t-butyl hydroperoxide [154] . While the conserved mitochondrial function was consistent with melatonin's discovery as an antioxidant [187] , the failure of vitamin C or E, molecules which also function as radical scavengers, is left unexplained. Perhaps the vitamins did not localize in sufficient amounts in the mitochondria to combat the large amounts of free radicals produced.",

However, when mitochondria were incubated with H2O2 and melatonin, the extreme mitochondrial fluorescent reaction that was associated with H2O2 only was quenched. Like Martin et al. [154] , Jou and co-workers [109] also found that vitamin E was significantly less effective than melatonin in reducing ROS-mediated mitochondrial fluorescence. The differences in the efficacies of melatonin versus vitamin E at the mitochondrial level were also apparent when the apoptotic indices of Fig. 2 This figure illustrates the facilitated transport of melatonin into mitochondria via the oligopeptide transporters, PEPT1 and PEPT2. The synthesis of melatonin in the mitochondrial matrix is also shown, a pathway that is aided by the ready availability of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA); acetyl CoA is a co-factor for the activity of the acetyltransferase enzyme (SNAT/AANAT). Locally-produced melatonin may diffuse out of the mitochondria and interact with melatonin membrane receptors (MT1/MT2) on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). By means of this action, melatonin may regulate cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. Within mitochondria, melatonin scavenges reactive oxygen species and stimulates the antioxidative enzyme, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a pathway that involves SIRT3 and FOXO3a. Also, melatonin protects against the deterioration of oxidative phosphorylation (CI-CV) and enhances ATP production. By reducing mitochondrial oxidation dyshomeostasis, melatonin reduces the oxidation of cardiolipin and limits cytochrome c release. Melatonin also regulates the opening of the mitochondria transition pore directly and via an action on uncoupling protein (UCP). For many of these functions, additional data are required before these actions can be identified as being definitive. IMM \u00bc inner mitochondrial membrane; IMS \u00bc intermembrane space; OMM \u00bc outer mitochondrial membrane; Try \u00bc tryptophan; 5OHTry \u00bc 5-hydroxytryptophan; 5-HT \u00bc serotonin; NAS \u00bc N-acetylserotonin. Other details can be found in the text the astrocytes were compared; thus, melatonin was more efficacious in limiting mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis than was vitamin E. Jou et al. [110, 111] extended the evidence related to the functional preservation of mitochondria when they found that intracellular calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial transition pore opening, cardiolipin depletion and, cytochrome c release were attenuated in astrocytes challenged by oxidizing situations but not when treated with melatonin.",

In addition to indicating the high likelihood of the importance of melatonin in mitochondrial physiology, it leaves in doubt, an answer to the question: what constitutes a physiological level of melatonin?

            "text": "The seemingly special association of melatonin with mitochondria [3, 195, 196] prompted an examination of the evolutionary heritage of this widely-distributed indoleamine. In 1995, Manchester et al. [150] had reported that a bacterium (Rhodospirillum rubrum) contained immunoreactive melatonin. Considering this finding and the alleged origin of both chloroplasts and mitochondria from bacteria that were ingested as food by early eukaryotes (Endosymbiotic Theory), we [244] proposed that melatonin initially evolved in bacteria several billion years ago and when they were ingested and developed into mitochondria in eukaryotes, they retained their melatonin-forming ability. This hypothesis has now been supported by the reports of He et al. [82] and Suofu et al. [233] . He et al. [82] showed that when isolated mouse oocyte mitochondria were incubated in medium containing the necessary precursor, serotonin, melatonin levels increased quickly in both the mitochondria and in the incubation medium. In the absence of available serotonin, no melatonin was formed. Meanwhile, Suofu et al. [233] approached the issue in a different manner by identifying the enzymes that synthesize melatonin from serotonin [35] , i.e., N-acetyltransferase and acetylserotonin methyltransferase, in non-synaptosomal neural cell mitochondria. As with He et al. [82] , when they incubated neurally-derived mitochondria with serotonin, these organelles formed melatonin and melatonin metabolites. Unlike melatonin production in the pineal gland, brain mitochondria did not exhibit a day: night rhythm in mitochondria consistent with the findings of Venegas et al. [256] . Based on the results of these two studies, it seems apparent that mitochondria have the necessary enzymes to synthesize their own melatonin.",

This involves the mediation of ULK1/FIP200/ATG101/ATG13 protein kinase and VPS34/beclin1/ VPS15/ATG14 lipid kinase complexes. Both complexes induce the formation of the ATG5/ATG12/ATG16L1 complex (formed with the help of Atg7 and Atg10), which promotes the elongation of the phagophore engulfing a portion of the cytosol or specific cargoes (proteins, lipids, organelles), forming a double-membrane-bound vacuole called the autophagosome. Aided by Atg3 and Atg7, these complexes facilitate the addition of a phosphatidylethanolamine group to the cytosolic form of mammalian LC3 homologues (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, Gabarap, Gabarap-L1, and Gabarap-L2), which is referred to as the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. The lipidbound form of LC3 homologues is then recruited to the autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome, forming a single-membrane-bound vesicle termed the autolysosome. Several lysosomal membrane proteins (GTPase RAB7, LAMP1, LAMP2, as well as SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin 17 and SNAP29) degraded the contents with the aid of another beclin1/VPS34 complex, where the UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), rather than Atg14, is required [129] .",

Parkinson disease is characterized by the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons causing gradual degeneration of certain brain regions. The protective role of melatonin via autophagic processes in experimental models of Parkinson disease has been reported [2] . Thus, the exposure of glial cell type C6 or mouse striatal cells to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) provokes in increase of LC3-II, mediated by upregulation of the cyclindependent kinase 5 (CDK5), inducing \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, which is reduced by pretreatment of mice with melatonin [230] . Rotenone, a Parkinson disease inducer, promoted autophagic cell death mediated by Bax and Omi release into the cytoplasm. A decrease in the expression of Bax and a drop in the release of Omi into the cytoplasm, as well as reduced cell death, was observed in Hela cells pre-treated with melatonin [288] . Another Parkinson disease inducer, kainic acid, increased \u03b1-synuclein and the level of LC3-II and promoted neuronal loss in the hippocampus of mice.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which occurs during obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), causes multiple cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease, hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy [72] . A higher LC3II/I ratio and greater Beclin1 expression in myocardial tissue of rats with CIH-induced myocardial hypertrophy suggest an increased autophagic response. Administration of melatonin induced additional autophagy via activation of AMPK, thereby having a protective effect in CIH rats [269] . Doxorubicin (DXR), which is an important chemotherapeutic agent, causes cardiotoxicity as a major side effect. Increased autophagy, which is upregulated during DXR-induced cardiotoxicity, is concomitant with a lower cell death [224] . The deteriorative effects of DXR on mitochondria are reduced by melatonin in an experimental model of cardiorenal syndrome; in this situation, melatonin reversed the drop in ATP production and inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

The triggering processes for apoptosis, extrinsic or receptor-mediated and intrinsic or mitochondria-mediated pathways, are complex and are partially known [185] . Recent evidence shows non-apoptotic roles for many usual effectors of the apoptotic signaling pathways. Thus, caspase 2, one of the best known molecules related to the triggering of apoptosis, is also involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair [254] . These new discoveries have complicated the understanding of the regulation of apoptosis. Apoptotic events are highly regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which shares homology among the four common Bcl-2 domains. This family includes antiapoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, that possess all the four (BH) domains and act on mitochondria [29] , endoplasmic reticulum and/or the nucleus [45] . The relationship that these proteins establish with free radicals has been identified and they have common actions on mitochondria [37] . Pro-apoptotic proteins are also included in Bcl-2 family. These proteins contain BH domains 1, 2, 3, unlike the anti-apoptotic proteins. The pro-apoptotic proteins include Bax and Bak which are related to the BH3-only proteins, i.e., Bim, Bad, Bmf, Noxa and Puma [95] .

This dual effect of ROS on apoptosis suggests an explanation of the actions of melatonin on the programmed cell death type since a major function of melatonin is as an antioxidant.

Similarly, melatonin reduces oxidative stress and hepatic apoptosis promoted by ethanol administration [165, 177] . In both cases, scavenging of ROS may be the major explanation for its anti-apoptotic effects. Moreover, melatonin is also efficient in the prevention of apoptosis by acting through its MT2 membrane receptor [218] in bile duct-ligated young rats or inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress, a process that often induces apoptosis [53] in leptin-deficient mice.

Several articles have confirmed that this coincidence is not accidental, with the loss of melatonin being related to aggravation or an increase in the incidence of the ailment [13, 169] . Thus, during aging, the drop in the nocturnal melatonin peak is associated with a rise in bone resorption, suggesting that melatonin may act as an endogenous osteoclast inhibitor [178] . Melatonin has been shown to limit bone resorption by limiting osteoclastogenesis [88, 127] . Since the osteoclastic actions involve apoptosis, melatonin indirectly inhibits cell death [152] .",

This mechanism involves neither membrane receptors (MT1, MT2) nor melatonin's antioxidant effect. This action involves the ubiquitination of target proteins in the apoptosis pathway, which is a usual mechanism that reduces Bcl-2 proteins and regulates apoptosis [264] . In porcine granulosa cells, melatonin limits BimEL, ubiquitinating it so it can be degraded by the proteasome [114] . This latter action not only identifies a new action of melatonin, but also may help to explain the differential behavior of melatonin in normal cells and cancer cells. In cancer cells, melatonin has been described as a potent proteasome inhibitor [258, 259] . Although many of the studies that show an inhibitory role of melatonin on apoptosis in normal cells may lack detailed mechanisms, the anti-apoptotic effect of melatonin deserves to be studied in greater detail considering the significant therapeutic repercussions that its use would imply. The brain is highly sensitive to oxidative stress because it consumes a large amount of oxygen and generates more ROS than most other tissues. Moreover, it is rich in easily-oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids and endowed with relatively low levels of endogenous antioxidants [147, 191] . This makes it a clear target in which to examine the role of antioxidants on apoptosis. Melatonin has been shown in multiple studies to be a highly effective neuroprotective agent not only in neurodegenerative diseases [206, 266, [281] [282] [283] , but also after brain injury [147] . These protective actions are related to the functions of melatonin as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic actions. In mice, melatonin may protect against ischemic stroke via an action on MT2 receptors [40] . During brain ischemia-reperfusion, melatonin reduces upregulation of Nox2 and Nox4 expression, enhancing its anti-apoptotic capacity [137] . Anti-apoptotic actions of melatonin, mediated by membrane receptors, are not confined to brain damage but also have been observed under neurobehavioral dysfunctions [265, 280] .",

Stem cells are classified into several categories: totipotent stem cells which can give rise to any cell type; pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into many tissue cell types, but not into a functional organism, and multipotent stem cells which can differentiate into a limited number of tissues. Stem cells have a huge therapeutic potential in a variety of diseases and they become essential to repair and regenerate damaged tissues or organs. However, the low survival rate of engrafted stem cells remains an important obstacle for stem cell therapy. It is essential to identify molecules capable of reducing cell death of stem cells and recent advances have indicated melatonin may be one such molecule.",

In the case of stem cells, it is noted that melatonin does not block the differentiation capacity of these cells by reducing free radicals; this is important since the increase in free radicals is a usual signal that leads to differentiation. Some authors, however, emphasize that \"melatonin might abolish redundant free radicals\" [65] . In fact, melatonin is not a differentiation-blocking agent, but is, instead, able to promote differentiation as several authors have noted [181, 245] .",

The first two act by performance optimization of essential organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response (UPR) and improving the mitochondrial physiology. The third one leads to protein destruction through the proteasome.

The regulation of AANAT synthesis in the pineal gland by its adrenergic innervation and the cAMP/PKA pathway has been described in detail [89, 120, 121] . These investigations reported the rapid decrease in AANAT protein induced by L-propranolol was blocked by proteasome inhibitors [68] . They concluded that the rapid drop in AANAT protein and AANAT activity induced by light exposure or propranolol administration was due to proteasomal degradation of AANAT. Additional data documenting a rise in AANAT in the pineal gland after administration of proteasome inhibitors was reported by Huang et al. [100] . These investigators also pointed out that stabilization of AANAT protein was regulated by phosphorylation and by interaction with a 14-3-3 protein.",

Considering the complexity of control mechanisms of AANAT, it is reasonable to speculate that more than one ubiquitin ligase is involved in regulation of AANAT degradation and transcription. Since CREB is a transcription factor involved in the transcription of AANAT [223, 257] the ubiquitin ligase CREBBP (CREB binding protein) would be a reasonable protein to investigate for its potential in regulating AANAT transcription. It was first isolated as a protein that binds to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) [41] . The p65 component of NF-kB is reported to bind to CREBBP (aka CBP) [271] .",

            "text": "Thus, activation of NF-kB, and its subsequent binding to DNA, requires the subtle dance of phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkB and IKK. The precise role of melatonin in this dance has not been completely determined. There are numerous technically convincing reports that melatonin inhibits NF-kB activation and inhibits DNA binding of p65 under various experimental conditions [25, 43, 99, 219] . The reports of melatonin inhibition of NFkB activation and inhibition of DNA binding refer to the 50p/p65 (p50/RelA) form of NFkB [136, 189] . Li et al (2009) interpreted the melatonin-induced inhibition of NFkB binding to DNA to be the result of melatonin blocking the degradation of IkB\u03b1. Further data was obtained by two separate research groups [10, 219] . Shi et al. [219] reported that melatonin inhibited the formation of the phosphorylated form of IkB\u03b1, but not the non-phosphorylated from of IkB\u03b1 in a cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In a study of exercise in rats on NF-kB, Alonso et al noted that phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 and IKK in muscle cells increased with exercise; the increase in both was prevented by melatonin [10] . Their data suggested that melatonin inhibited degradation of phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 indirectly by inhibiting the activity of IKK. If IKK is the key to NF-kB activation, as suggested by Karin and Ben-Neriah [115] , it could also be the key to understanding the mechanisms of melatonin in NF-kB activation. Since IKK\u03b2 is a substrate of the ubiquitin ligase Keap1 complex and is responsible for its ubiquitination [132, 250, 251] , we suggest that the interaction of Keap1 and IKK may contribute to the mechanism by which melatonin administration activates NF-kB.",

One aspect of this is that melatonin stimulates the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, heme oxygenase 1, and NADPH:quinoneoxidoreductase [65, 198, 205] . As noted, proteasome inhibitors also stimulate the activity of these enzymes. The components of the antioxidant stress response have been well described. They include the Keap1 ubiquitin ligase complex and the NRF2-antioxidant response element pathway. We reviewed the evidence that the antioxidant action of melatonin involves the Keap1-NRF2-ARE pathway in 2015 [260, 261] . We speculated that one possible mechanism that would explain the stimulation of antioxidant enzymes by melatonin was inhibition of the proteasome. While there was some evidence for this in vitro this has not been shown to be a direct effect [182] .",

Melatonin is also reported to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis in rats with liver fibrosis [113] and the hepatic cells in culture [73] . The ubiquitin proteasome system could coordinate the various actions of melatonin associated with the mitochondria, but there is little information available on the topic. Lavie and co-authors estimated that 203 mitochondrial proteins were ubiquitinated [130] including outer and inner membrane proteins. They noted that the UPS promotes succinate dehydrogenase dependent oxygen consumption and increases ATP, malate and citrate levels and concluded that the UPS regulates energy metabolism in the mitochondria. The UPS also controls biogenesis of mitochondria [28] and mitophagy [30] .",

The common features of those models are that they provide strong clues as to the mechanisms by which melatonin interacts with the UPS. Recently melatonin has been associated with epigenetics.

When DNA is not being transcribed, it is tightly wound around the nucleosomes, preventing the binding and initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. For transcription, this \"closed\" chromatin structure has to be \"opened\" for it to be accessible; this occurs by acetylation of lysine residues in the histones, catalyzed by HATs. Acetylated lysine residues are recognized by protein complexes containing bromodomains that modulate chromatin architecture. When transcription is complete, acetylated lysine residues of histone are deacetylated by HDACs, returning chromatin to a closed state. In addition to acetylation-deacetylation, reversible methylation by histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, reversible phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases, mono-ubiquitination, sumoylation of lysine residues that inhibits acetylation, glycosylation and ADP ribosylation are also known to occur.",

Melatonin also appears to induce gene expression by acetylation of histone H3; conversely, perhaps as a negative feedback loop, it promotes the expression of HDAC3, HDAC5 and HDAC7, leading to gene repression [217] . The most widely reported mechanism that links melatonin to epigenetic regulation is via its induction of sirtuins (silent information regulators), a family of seven known class III NAD + -dependent HDACS (SIRT1 to SIRT7). In normal cells, melatonin is known to upregulate SIRT1 expression and/or mitochondrial SIRT3 under various conditions [23, 76] .

Melatonin appears to be particularly suitable in serving as an environmental sensor [106] , given that its secretion is affected by different wavelengths of light [192] , temperature [160] , altitude [116] and seasonal cycles [85] . Recent literature indicates that melatonin protects spermatogonial stem cells from endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A or diethylhexyl phthalate by maintaining histone H3K9 dimethylation and promotes their recovery [284] . Similarly, melatonin also protects spermatogonial stem cells in mice from hexavalent chromium, another environmental carcinogen, by preventing trimethylation of histone H3K9 or H3K27, thereby preventing germ cell apoptosis and maintaining fertility [148, 287] . Protective epigenetic mechanisms underlying antioxidant defense of germ cells was demonstrated by a recent study showing hypomethylation of SOD1, Gpx4 and Cat genes in ovine prepubertal cumulus cells of lambs treated with melatonin that resulted in decreased apoptosis [64] . Surprisingly, melatonin treatment also upregulated DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in ovine prepubertal cumulus cells, with the latter gene being significantly hypomethylated [63] , suggesting selective hypomethylation of the antioxidant genes. DNMT1a expression is upregulated in melatonin-treated oocytes along with increased expression of oocyte maturation-related genes, GDF9 and MARF, suggesting a beneficial epigenetic role for melatonin in oocyte maturation [251] . Melatonin also appears to reduce apoptosis of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos by stimulating SOD1 and Gpx4 expression that was associated with higher H3K9ac levels [230] .",

Melatonin also appears to play a role in alleviating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by upregulating the expression of SIRT1 that, in turn, inhibits interleukin-1B and NLRP3-mediated inflammation [183] .

Recent data support a melatonin-mediated upregulation in global methylation as a key factor in tumor suppression [75, 214] . In contrast with its function in normal cells, melatonin appears to downregulate SIRT1 in cancer cells and thereby decreases their proliferative capacity [112] . Importantly, treatment of a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, with melatonin followed by mapping of the epigenome identified several thousand differentially methylated genes [133] , indicating an epigenetic tumor-suppressing role for melatonin in cancer. In breast cancer, the tumor suppressor gene, brca1, the DNA repair gene, rad9, and the cell cycle regulation genes, dkk3 and wif1, are hyper methylated, leading to their silencing; hypomethylation of oncogenes and transposable elements such as Alu are associated with poor prognosis. Chronodisruption in shift workers leads to clock hypomethylation and cry2 hypermethylation, as also found in breast cancer [289] . However, direct epigenetic links between chronodisruption and breast cancer are yet to be firmly established [124] . Interestingly, Mtnr1a mRNA expression is reduced in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma; its re-expression in tumor cells inhibited growth in vitro, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for melatonin in oral cancer [168] . Moreover, melatonin suppresses senescent cancer cell-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by inhibiting PARP-1interaction with the long non-coding RNA, TERRA, thereby preventing H2BK120 acetylation [276] . Finally, melatonin suppresses microRNA, miR-24, post-trancriptionally and thereby inhibits cell proliferation and migration [166] .",

In addition to neurogenesis, melatonin has anti-aging neural effects that is also linked to its upregulation of SIRT1 [74] . Importantly, it protects the hippocampus from pre-natal glucocorticoid exposure by downregulating the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 mRNA expression and by suppressing DNMT1 and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binding to the reln promoter, thereby restoring the decreased levels of reln and GAD1 mRNA expression [146] . Melatonin also ameliorates neuropathic allodynia by promoting HDAC4 dephosphorylation and nuclear import with consequent upregulation of hmgb1 transcription [141] .

Damaging fibrosis is most commonly reported in the lung [203] , heart [169] , liver [104] , and kidney [172] but it occurs in other situations where inflammation is rampant [94] as well as in the form of adhesions [14] among organs after surgical intervention, infection, oxidative stress, etc. Whereas there is some evidence that fibrosis may be reversible, particularly in the early stages, advanced fibrosis is associated with end stage disease, organ failure and death. To overcome the latter two events, the only available treatment is organ transplantation. Initially, fibrosis is a physiological reparative process but, when it continues to expand, it becomes pathological and life threatening (Fig. 6) . Thus, limiting the sustained development of pro-fibrotic processes is medically critical. Fig. 6 Profibrotic stimuli, which are numerous, if sustained only for a brief interval cause minor organ fibrosis. Some evidence suggests that, at this point, if the fibrotic stimulus is interrupted or if melatonin treatment is initiated, the developing fibrogenic phenotype may be reversed with partial morphological and functional restoration of the organ. With more persistent attack and excessive fibroproliferative conditions, the \"point-of-no-return\" is exceeded and extensive fibrosis and cirrhosis occur. Eventually, organ failure is the result leading to total organ function failure and death if the organ is not replaced The sequence of events for the fibrotic changes that occur in different organs are similar at the molecular level with common pathological pathways that culminate in serious negative outcomes [97] . Fibrosis is initiated by a variety of pro-fibrotic processes; some of the most common are inflammation (e.g., macrophages and T cells) and oxidative stress. The latter process may be the result of a different events such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, toxin exposure, ionizing radiation damage, etc. Dysfunctional epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, following their recruitment to the site of injury, become fibrosis-initiator cells, which transform and actively proliferate. These activated cells include fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and other collagen-generating elements that are derived from organ-specific cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In some organs there are other cells that contribute collagen and extracellular matrix deposition, e.g., stellate cells of the liver [238] .",

These findings suggest that, at least in part and under some conditions, melatonin probably controls the activity of hyperfunctional fibroblasts/myofibroblasts via receptormediated mechanisms [97] . Given the high damaging reactive oxygen species generation by inflammatory cells and cells crippled by ironizing radiation, drugs, etc., melatonin's receptor-independent actions may also be involved in suppressing the development of fibrosis [66, 80] .

Experimentally, the regular administration of melatonin to animals exposed daily to cigarette smoke (see below) or to bleomycin [21] curtailed the severity of alveolar destruction as indicted by the amounts of oxidatively damaged protein and lipid in the lungs.

For the in vivo test, rats were exposed to cigarette smoke daily for a week and treated with lipopolysaccharide intravenously with or without daily melatonin treatment. At the conclusion of the study (on day 7), the non-melatonin treated rats had high numbers of inflammatory cells in their bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and an elevated expression of TGF-\u03b21, collagen I and Smad3 in their lung tissues. In a dose-response manner, melatonin inhibited each of the parameters. The in vitro study utilized a human mucoepithelial cell line treated with cigarette smoke condensate (SSC). This treatment caused an elevated expression of not only TGF-\u03b21 and collagen I, but also tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and Smad 3 and p38 phosphorylation.

It is the authors' opinion, in fact, that what is known about the intimate actions of melatonin is a small fraction of what it actually does. Moreover, past and recently discovered actions are only epiphenomenal of what melatonin does with the real actions of this molecule yet to be revealed.",

            "text": "The goal of subsequent research is to aggressively continue to examine the actions of this multifaceted agent; especially since many publications have strongly indicated that melatonin is a functionally flexible and highly beneficial molecule. This is apparent from the results of a number of reports where melatonin has been used at the clinical and veterinary levels. Almost uniformly, these findings show that melatonin promotes optimal function and the well-being of cells, of organs and of organisms. Finally, in plants, which also produce this molecule, melatonin's actions are equally important and life sustaining. Fig. 7 Melatonin seems to interfere with fibrotic development via several means. A major factor in initiating the fibrotic cascade is transforming growth factor-1\u03b2 (TGF-1\u03b2). Melatonin inhibits TGF-1\u03b2 and associated cytokines thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and reducing the excessive accumulation of extracellular collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Likewise, via SIRT1 stimulation, melatonin inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 generation. Additionally, by means of its direct radical scavenging actions and its stimulation of antioxidant enzymes, e.g., superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), melatonin reduces oxidative stress which normally promotes fibrosis. Many details of these pathways remain to be clarified",
