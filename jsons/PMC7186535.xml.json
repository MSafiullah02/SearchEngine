COVID-19 patients develop profound hypoxemia early in their disease course. However, overt respiratory dysfunction at these early stages is unusual. Pulmonary compliance in intubated COVID-19 patients appears to be only modestly decreased, and patients are therefore relatively easy to ventilate [1]. Gattinoni et al. [1] described hyperperfusion of poorly ventilated lung, perhaps due to vasodilation and the loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction. While benefit from low-to-moderate levels of PEEP and prone positioning have been noted, these authors suggest that they result more from hemodynamics effects than lung recruitment [1]. Later in the course of COVID-19, some patients develop a phenotype more consistent with ARDS [1, 2].",

Among CRS patients, mean interleukin-6 levels are frequently as high as 10,000 pg/mL [5]. Other inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-8, interleukin-1\u03b2) demonstrate similar patterns. In summary, COVID-19 is associated with only mild inflammatory cytokine elevation and demonstrates physiology and immunology that are difficult to reconcile with ARDS or CRS. An alternative mechanism of disease therefore seems likely.",

Pulmonary shunting is consistent with intense vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. The observation that 89% of hospitalized patients in Rome showed subsegmental vascular enlargement on their admission computed tomography scan supports this view [6]. Reports of increased respiratory dead space suggest lung-vascular thrombosis from thrombotic microangiopathy or pulmonary embolism. The latter was recently reported in up to 40% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [7]. Autopsies performed on patients who died early on were indeed notable for lung-vascular congestion [8]. Vascular disease may also explain massive D-dimer elevations, while antiphospholipid antibodies were recently reported in COVID-19 [9]. A constellation of multi-system organ involvement, low-grade inflammation, lymphopenia, hypercoagulability, and heterogenous microvascular dysfunction is a classic description of many systemic vasculopathies, such as vasculitides (Supplement Table).",

Chemokine-mediated lymphocyte recruitment and subsequent infection of lymphocytes, which also express ACE-2, likely contribute to lymphocyte apoptosis, natural killer and B cell suppression, and T cell exhaustion, as noted by Qin et al.

In the early phases of infection, ACE-2 consumption by viral entry would be predicted to increase local AngII concentration. Among the known effects of AngII are vasoconstriction, endothelial activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Platelet activation by AngII may further enhance a pro-thrombotic milieu. AngII also has potent chemotactic effects that may accelerate lymphocyte recruitment and suppression. Importantly, admission AngII levels in COVID-19 patients are reportedly twice the normal levels [13]. In addition, pulmonary vascular inflammation specifically leads to a phenomenon known as ACE-1 \u201cshedding,\u201d where endothelial surface-bound ACE-1 is released into the interstitium [14]. This phenomenon initially produces a sharp increase in local AngII that gradually decreases until concentrations are well below physiologic levels [14]. Because AngII downregulates ACE-2 expression, transition to a state of AngII deficiency is consistent with the increased ACE-2 expression noted at autopsy [10]. Of note, AngII reportedly increases microvascular permeability under basal conditions but decreases permeability during inflammation, an effect attributed to the inflammation-induced shift from type-1 to type-2 receptor expression [15].",
