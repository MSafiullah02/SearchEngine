            "text": "In December 2019, the first coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cases associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1\u20133]. As of March 26th, 2020, there have been 465,781 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide including China, Italy, the United States, Spain and Iran, with 50,006 patients were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. More than 20,000 people have died from COVID-19 so far. What also seems to be emerging among these numbers is a clear sex difference in who is contracting and dying from the virus. Several epidemiological studies observed possible differences in the progression of disease between different sexes [4\u20139]. Compared to women, it is suggested that men are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units and are also associated with higher mortality. Therefore, to confirm and further explore the possible mechanisms of the sex differences in clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we conducted a single-center retrospective analysis in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. In total, 168 severe cases were included. We highlighted sex-specific differences in the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19, which are consistent with the sex bias observed in other COVID-19-related studies. We also provided more evidence and explored the underlying mechanism with epidemiological analysis.",

The study sample comprised of 86 males and 82 females. Outcomes were assessed as discharged, remaining in hospital, or death. Fig 1 illustrates the proportion of males and females with different clinical outcomes between different age groups and in patients with/without comorbidities. In total, 17 of the 168 patients (8.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 died following progression. 136 patients survived to hospital discharge, giving a survival to hospital discharge rate of 81.0%. Significant differences existed across different age groups with regards to mortality rates (P = .0001) and hospital discharge rates (P = .0014). When comparing the mortality and hospital discharge rates between women and men, men had a trend toward a higher risk of mortality and a lower hospital discharge rate (Fig 1). Furthermore, what stands out in this chart is that the patients with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate than those who did not (P < .0001), which implies that underlying diseases might influence the severity of COVID-19 (Fig 1).To figure out how sex interacts with these comorbidities, we have graphed and analyzed the outcome data of male and female patients with and without comorbidities separately. Fig 1 indicated that males with comorbidity had the highest mortality rate among all patients.",

Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, especially for inflammatory markers and functional indexes of the liver and kidney. All of them were increased substantially in male patients (P < .05, Table 2). Six clinical laboratory parameters, including hematological and biochemical parameters, were chosen from indicators with significant differences between patients who died and in patients who were discharged. To determine the potential effects of indicators with sex differences, we tracked the sex-specific dynamic changes of the six selected laboratory parameters during the course of COVID-19 (Fig 2). Clinical data from 153 patients with complete clinical courses were analyzed, including 17 patients who died and 136 patients discharged from the hospital. T1 refers to the first test after hospital admission, T2 refers to the midpoint test during the whole hospital stay, and T3 refers to the last test before discharge. During hospitalization, patients who died had a marked increase in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at admission and even developed a higher NLR over time. Similarly, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine were all higher in patients who died than in patients discharged from hospital (P < .05). Therefore, we analyzed the sex-specific dynamic changes in selected laboratory parameters during the course of COVID-19 in patients who died (Fig 2A\u20132F) and in patients who were discharged (Fig 2G\u20132L). As shown in Fig 2A\u20132F, there were clear separations between the curve for males and the curve for females in patients who died except for BUN. As the clinical status deteriorated, the levels of these parameters progressively increased before death. Furthermore, the sex-specific curves for NLR, CRP, AST and LDH crossed each other in discharged patients, whereas BUN and creatinine were separate (Fig 2G\u20132J).",

In the present analysis, we included comorbidities, respiratory symptoms, days from illness onset to the first admission and pathogens identified as potential confounding factors. After adjustment for confounders, elderly males aged >80 years old were more likely to develop critically ill conditions than males aged <59 years old (OR = 9.333, 95% CI: 1.618\u201353.845). However, for females, the difference was not significant according to the adjusted model (OR = 10.161, 95% CI: 0.911\u2013113.346). Our analysis also illustrated that the patients with comorbidity had a higher risk of critically ill conditions and mortality rate (P < .0001). The relation between comorbidities and critically ill conditions was assessed with appropriate adjustments for covariates including age, respiratory symptoms, days from illness onset to the first admission and the pathogens identified.

In this study, we conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 168 critically ill patients, explicitly evaluating the sex differences in clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and confirming the positive correlation between fatality and age. Compared with other studies, the duration of the median follow-up in our study was 27 days (IQR 22\u201334 days), with accurate follow-up and few missing data. In addition, our study included only severe patients and critically ill patients, who have a poorer prognosis and deserve further attention.",

            "text": "While the epidemiological data of COVID-19 have shown sex bias in the fatality rate and clinical characteristics, the mechanism underlying this difference is still not clear. A variety of factors may cause disparities in sex-specific disease outcomes. For instance, sex-specific disease outcomes may be explained by steroids and the activity of X-linked genes, both of which modulate the immune response to viral infection [12,13]. It is well known that males and females differ in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Sex-specific inflammatory responses caused by the unique mode of inheritance of the X chromosome may also lead to the differences [13]. The latest studies have demonstrated that there is the high expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the putative receptor of SARS-nCoV-2, in the normal lung tissue of Asian men [14]. It has been suggested that 17\u03b2-estradiol could downregulate lung ACE2 mRNA and protect females from influenza A virus pathogenesis [15,16]. Previous studies also found higher percentages of SARS-CoV infection in male mice than in female mice and provided mechanistic insights related to estrogen [17].",

Significant differences in certain laboratory parameters were observed between males and females (Table 2). After the exclusion of the recognized sex-specific parameters (e.g., hemoglobin and hematocrit), the remaining indicators were identified as potential biomarker candidates that played a potential role in the sex bias of mortality. During hospitalization, NLR, CRP, AST, LDH, BUN and serum creatinine were all higher in patients who died than in patients discharged from the hospital (P < .05). We also analyzed the sex-specific dynamic changes in selected laboratory parameters during the course of COVID-19 in patients who died and in patients who were discharged (Fig 2). It has been indicated that these sex differences in NLR, CRP, AST, LDH, and serum creatinine in patients who died may explain the sex-specific clinical characteristics and outcomes. Based on previous studies, other literature on COVID-19 has emphasized the importance of lymphocyte responses and proinflammatory cytokine storms [18\u201320]. Additionally, abnormal liver and kidney function have also been observed in other studies [5,21], but it was unclear whether they were due to viral characteristics or drug-induced liver/kidney injury [21,22]. Considering the significant differences in the functional indexes of the liver and kidney, more attention should be paid to the monitoring and evaluation of liver and kidney function during the treatment of critically ill patients.",

In the present study, the risk of critically ill conditions was significantly associated with age and comorbidities in the crude model. The positive correlation remained robust in males after adjustment, but the effect was attenuated to null in female patients. In total, the results of this study indicate that although age and comorbidities are both important factors that have substantial influence on the progression of COVID-19, the impact showed pronounced sex-specific differences. We speculated that the age effects mainly reflect the physiological and social changes of aging patients, especially for elderly males. Therefore, disparities between males and females suggest that more attention to elderly males with COVID-19 is needed in both research and treatment. It was suggested that the worse prognosis of COVID-19 was associated with chronic comorbidities as a result of weaker immune functions [23,24]. Considering that 36.0% of male patients had chronic underlying diseases (mainly diabetes and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases), more attention needs to be paid to male patients in poor physical conditions.",
