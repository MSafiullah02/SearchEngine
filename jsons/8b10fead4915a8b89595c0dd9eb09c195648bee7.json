People most vulnerable to COVID-19 include those with underlying health conditions. 2 Yet the pandemic is disrupting clinical trials addressing these same health conditions. 3 There are over 300,000 studies being conducted worldwide registered on clinicaltrials.gov. 4 Hence, there is a necessity to continue some ongoing research studies safely and a critical need for novel research into the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and we must try to anticipate the ethical and social implications of this global pandemic. This commentary is directed at these two pressing ethical questions: How can clinical trials be conducted ethically in the midst of the current global pandemic? What social and ethical issues prompted by COVID-19 merit further research?",

Other options include providing follow-up care and research tests at facilities closer to home or virtually using video conferencing technologies, and shipping study-related investigational products directly to participants when appropriate. 6, 7 Deciding which studies should continue to enroll new participants or provide follow-up visits is partly influenced by the local prevalence and healthcare burden of COVID-19.",

Developing a standard of supportive care for RCTs that span sites around the world is both practically and ethically challenging. Pre-existing socioeconomic differences and health infrastructures within communities may drive local and regional differences in what is standard of care. Moreover, supportive care standards might also change over time, including in response to emerging data informing better care and to dynamic resource constraints as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.",

Previous public health and humanitarian emergencies have produced moral distress, providing us important evidence for anticipating these challenges should they arise in the weeks and months ahead. 32 Moral distress is a useful area for further bioethics and social science investigation because it can illuminate the underlying content and sources of the most pressing ethical concerns among health professionals. Sources of moral distress previously identified include institutional policies that have unintended consequences, and decisional hierarchies that can compromise a sense of professional integrity. 30, 31, 33 However, moral distress can be difficult to disentangle from other forms of psychological anxiety and trauma induced by stress and crisis response. This distinction is crucial to ensuring healthcare professionals receive the mental health resources needed to sustain their efforts and personal wellbeing, given the link of moral distress to compassion fatigue and burnout. 34 Exploring the distinct moral concerns at the core of moral distress is also important. Such research can be coupled with investigations into resilience, including the institutional structures and practices that most support frontline healthcare providers through these times of crisis.",
