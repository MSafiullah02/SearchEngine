Along with this outbreak is a parallel pandemic of fear, anxiety, and depression. The virus does not only affect physical health but also emotional well-being of all mankind, bringing substantial psychosocial impact on every member of the society. During this unprecedented outbreak, necessary measures had been taken to contain the virus transmission by mass indoor quarantine and social distancing. In Malaysia, movement control order has been implemented throughout the country as a containment measure battling this pandemic (Tang, 2020).",

Despite for safety concern, practicing social distancing and self-quarantine would be distressing for some. Although these negative feelings and thoughts are universal, the emotionally vulnerable group could be more substantially influenced by their emotional responses. One subgroup of these population is people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) where their vulnerability is attributable to the underlying hyper-responsiveness to stress compared with normal controls (Wingenfeld et al., 2010).",

Evidence showed that due to the insecure or disorganized attachment, there is an over-activation of the attachment system which lead to its operation at a heightened sense (Bateman & Fonagy, 2016).

There was also an imbalance of the self-versus other mentalizing domain when she was concerned about self-internal state and feared of \u201cdisappearing\u201d, to the extent of attempting to control others by forcing them to maintain conversation with her. In addition, she was overly sensitive to external signs of intimacy such as the frequency of contacts made by her friends and silence from the others.

In the above case, the thought of being abandoned and the subjective feeling of emptiness were transformed to the absolute certainty with a distorted reality, thus creating a concrete understanding of the whole situation that her friends were indeed abandoning her. Subsequently, there was teleological drive wish to get attention from her friends by actively monitoring for any external evidence of perceived affection. Only friends who made any forms of contacts with her were considered as those who would really care for her. All these prementalizing modes dictated her expectation and responses to others in a distorted manner during social interaction.",
