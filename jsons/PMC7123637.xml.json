            "text": "Rituximab is a genetically engineered, chimeric murine/human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds specifically to the CD20 antigen, which is expressed on normal B-cells and on the vast majority of malignant cells in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [1]. The binding of rituximab to the CD20 ligand causes cell lysis through a variety of mechanisms, including complement-mediated cytotoxicty, antibody-dependent cell (e.g., NK cells)-mediated cytoxicity and direct induction of cell apoptosis [1]. Rituximab has been extensively studied and used to treat CD20 positive, B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, either as a single agent or more commonly in combination with chemotherapy; in recent years it has also been used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. It has currently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of: (1) low-grade/follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) as first-line treatment as well as for relapsed or refractory disease and for maintenance therapy in this disorder; (2) diffuse large B-cell NHL as first-line treatment in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens; (3) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in previously untreated patients, in combination with chemotherapy; (4) rheumatoid arthritis, in combination with methotrexate, for patients with an inadequate response to one or more of the TNF antagonist therapies [1]. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, rituximab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune cytopenias, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), as well as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjorgen\u2019s syndrome, vasculitides, and autoimmune neurologic and dermatologic disorders [2].",

Patients with high numbers of circulating neoplastic lymphoid cells may develop cytokine-release syndrome [3] and/or tumor lysis syndrome [4]. Other infrequent adverse affects include delayed neutropenia [5], hepatitis B virus reactivation [6], Stevens Johnson syndrome [7] and serum sickness [8].",

            "text": "The majority of cases of rituximab-associated pulmonary toxicity occurred within days and up to 3 weeks after the first infusion of the antibody or following subsequent cycles with rituximab treatment. It appeared to occur most commonly after the fourth cycle of therapy and within a mean of 12 weeks after the initial rituximab infusion [9]. Patients usually presented with dyspnea, dry cough, signs of hypoxemia and occasional fever [10\u201316]. Crackles are present on physical examination in approximately a third of the patients [9]. Chest radiographs may reveal patchy or diffuse mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates [8, 18, 23, 24, 26, 30], while CT scan typically shows multiple focal alveolar infiltrates and areas of \u201cground-glass\u201d shadowing [11, 15, 17, 23, 24, 26]. Pulmonary function tests are mostly compatible with restrictive abnormalities associated with a reduced diffusion capacity [11, 14, 30]. In some cases, a PET scan, performed for the evaluation of lymphoma response to treatment, showed some form of uptake, thereby detecting early pulmonary changes [8, 31, 32] while patients were still basically asymptomatic. In other cases, a PET-CT scan revealed late-onset pulmonary infiltrates, occurring between 1 and 3 months after the treatment of rituximab was discontinued, appearing as linear subpleural FDG uptake, which sometimes persisted for several months [33]. Bronchoaleveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for infectious disease, and cytology was negative for malignant cells, whereas normal CD4+ T-lymphocytes predominated [15, 18, 25]. Trans-bronchial or lung biopsies most commonly showed histological findings compatible with organizing pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis [9, 19\u201321, 23, 30, 34]; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and acute pulmonary fibrosis were less commonly observed [15, 16, 18].",

            "text": "Acute lung toxicity, mostly ARDS, is considered to be the result of a cytokine release syndrome with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3), interleukin-6 (IL-6) or interleukin-8 (IL-8)] [3, 9] released in high concentrations. This clinical picture occurs shortly after the first infusion of rituximab, at a time when the patient still has a large tumor burden [9]. The more insidious onset reactions described appear to be due to hypersensitivity reactions, and continuing treatment with rituximab results in recurrence of the same symptoms, but of increasing severity [9, 15, 26]. This type of rituximab-associated pulmonary toxicity seems to respond favorably to corticosteroid therapy [9]. It has also been suggested that the mechanism of toxicity seen in the latter reaction may also be linked to the release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF- \u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-8 [11, 35], complement activation [15] or indirect cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation [15], all of which are known to occur during therapy with rituximab [36, 37]. Along this line, results of an experimental in vitro model have suggested that apoptotic lymphoma cells undergo phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DC). This leads to DC maturation and thereafter promotes induction of a cytotoxic T-cell response against these lymphoma cell-associated antigens [37, 38].",

            "text": "The appearance of pulmonary infiltrates in lymphoma patients receiving rituximab is a challenging situation. Several diagnoses can be considered, namely cardiogenic pulmonary edema, infection, progressive lymphoma, exacerbation of underlying chronic lung disease and drug-related pulmonary toxicity. Rituximab-related pulmonary toxicity is basically a diagnosis of exclusion. In immunocompromised patients, infectious causes, such as bacterial pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, viral pneumonits including CMV, P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and fungal infection, should all be considered in the differential diagnosis. In this respect, the development of PCP has been reported during rituximab therapy, particularly in patients with NHL co-treated with the antibody and combination chemotherapy [39\u201344]. A few cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation have also been recorded in the rituximab-treated patients [45\u201347]. After excluding the above-mentioned infectious causes, special consideration should be given to the possibility of drug-related pulmonary toxicity. Many cytotoxic agents are known to cause lung injury. In this respect, cyclophosphamide in particular, one of the most common agents used in combination with rituximab for the treatment of NHL and CLL, should be considered as one of the possible agents causing this clinical and radiological picture. As in the case of rituximab, the incidence of cyclophosphamide induced-pulmonary toxicity is low [48, 49], and the interval between exposure to cyclophosphamide and the appearance of the pulmonary insult varies from weeks to several years [48]. Early onset toxicity usually appears about 1\u20136 months after exposure to cyclophosphamide, and typically patients present with 1\u20132 weeks of dyspnea on effort and a dry cough [48, 49]. Bilateral basal reticular or reticulo-nodular infiltrates are seen on chest X-ray [49], \u201cground-glass\u201d shadowing is evident on CT scan [49], and pulmonary function tests show restrictive abnormalities with reduced diffusion capacity [49]. Late-onset toxicity generally appears in patients who had received relatively low doses of cyclophosphamide given over a prolonged period of time [49], and these may occur years after discontinuation of the drug [49]. While the prognosis of early onset toxicity is generally good and corticosteroids are beneficial, late-onset toxicity has a poorer outcome and often progresses despite therapy with steroids [48, 49]. The histopathological spectrum of cyclophosphamide-induced lung injury includes: nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [49]. In this regard, the endogenous production of reactive oxygen radicals was suggested as the most probable underlying mechanism for this pulmonary toxicity [48]. G-CSF is a growth factor commonly used in cancer patients to shorten the period of neutropenia following chemotherapy and is also utilized to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells for stem cell transplantation. Common adverse effects of G-CSF include fever, bone pain and fatigue. Pulmonary toxicities attributed to G-CSF include cough, dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS [50]. When used as a single agent, among 1,801 published cases of healthy stem cell donors given G-CSF for stem cell mobilization, lung toxicity was reported in 1 case only [50]. G-CSF-related pulmonary toxicity is more frequently reported in patients receiving this growth factor in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, and in these cases G-CSF may actually exacerbate chemotherapy-related pulmonary toxicity, particularly when cyclophosphamide, bleomycin or methotrexate is the chemotherapeutic agent involved [50]. G-CSF related-pulmonary toxicity can be fatal, with a relatively high mortality rate (24.6%) [50]. Because neutropenic patients treated with G-CSF frequently develop their pulmonary symptoms during or after recovery from the neutropenia, it was suggested that neutrophils play a central role in mediating this toxicity [50]. Treatment with G-CSF not only increases the number of neutrophils, but also enhances their functions [51, 52], thereby promoting neutrophil entrapment in the pulmonary vascular capillaries, and release of their oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes, which may cause subsequent endothelial and pulmonary damage [53\u201357]. G-CSF is commonly given for patients who have been treated with rituximab-containing regimens, and these combinations of drugs may potentially increase the risk of pulmonary toxicity [19, 30].",

Re-treatment with rituximab was uneventful in a proportion of these cases [12], whereas in others, re-treatment with rituximab, as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, did cause pulmonary deterioration [10, 15], which was fatal in some cases [8, 15]. Accordingly, it is recommended that in patients suspected of having rituximab-related pulmonary toxicity, any possible agent known to cause pulmonary toxicity should be stopped. Furthermore, in addition to any empirical anti-infectious therapy given, corticosteroid therapy should also be initiated early on. After pulmonary recovery, rituximab re-challenge is best avoided.",
