The levels of PaCO2 and the corresponding minute ventilation show a linear correlation, the slope of which represents the \u201cbrain\u201d respiratory drive [11].

Increase in PaCO2, promoted by high dead space, induces a linear increase in respiratory drive through both central and peripheral chemoreceptors [14, 15]. On the other hand, the ventilatory response following severe hypoxemia typical of ARDS is not linear but hyperbolic [11]. Peripheral chemoreceptors, which are relatively insensitive at mild hypoxemia, increase the neural respiratory drive in response to more severe hypoxemia, mainly by enhancing the ventilatory response to CO2 when the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) falls below 60\u201370 mmHg. This effect can be potentiated by concomitant hypercapnia. Metabolic acidosis, which frequently complicates ARDS because of shock or acute kidney injury, stimulates both peripheral and central chemoreceptors [16].",

In awake spontaneously breathing rats, ARDS induces an increase in respiratory rate occurring before impairment of gas exchange. Hypoxic ventilatory response is also exaggerated due to a sensitization of peripheral chemoreceptors [17]. Local and systemic inflammation are hallmarks of ARDS [18], and pulmonary C-fibers sensitive to inflammatory mediators (including histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandins) are consistently activated in lung edema [19] and experimental acute lung injury [20]. Vagal afferents from these lung chemoreceptors can modulate the breathing pattern through a central reflex pathway [21]. The consequence of vagal activation is an increase in respiratory rate with a decrease in tidal volume, i.e., rapid shallow breathing [22, 23], possibly through vagally mediated release of cytokines in the brainstem [24].",

Although the Hering-Breuer reflex might be inhibited by the behavioural control of breathing in awake humans [25], decreased inhibitory input from these mechanoreceptors in the atelectatic lung could promote a further increase in inspiratory effort in ARDS. Indeed, the activation of mechanoreceptors appears to decrease as ARDS develops [20], while it is increased by increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [26], probably through stabilized lung recruitment. This could be one of the mechanisms by which high PEEP decreases spontaneous respiratory effort in ARDS [27]. Stimulation of the respiratory centres through each of these mechanisms increases the slope\u2014and shift to the left\u2014of the brain curve. Decreases in lung and chest wall compliance increase the elastic load and can alter the neuro-mechanical coupling between effort and diaphragmatic excursion. The result is a decreased slope of the ventilation curve and an increase in PaCO2, which induces a stimulation of neural respiratory drive and a dissociation between brain and ventilation curves (Fig. 3).",

Eadi may be recorded using an oesophageal catheter with multiple electrodes and it represents the \u201cclosest\u201d surrogate of neural respiratory drive available in clinical practice [32]. Because of high inter-individual variability, it is difficult to provide references for absolute values of EAdi [33]. However, trends in EAdi allow the tracking of changes in neural output in individual patients [34]. EAdi is also increased in the presence of low muscle strength [35] and the ratio of actual EAdi to maximum EAdi measured during an occlusion may provide an accurate estimate of the patient neural respiratory drive and effort to breathe [33]. The ratio between tidal volume (Vt) and EAdi represents the neuroventilatory efficiency of the diaphragm [36]: a low Vt/EAdi ratio, either due to diaphragm dysfunction or to compromised respiratory mechanics, indicates dissociation between neural respiratory drive and ventilatory response. EAdi monitoring only assesses the activity of the diaphragm. However, recruitment of accessory inspiratory [37] and expiratory [38, 39] muscles is a strong indicator of increased neural respiratory drive due to a mismatch between the respiratory load and the muscle capacity with decreased expiratory time. Surface electromyography of extra-diaphragmatic respiratory muscles could, therefore, integrate the EAdi for a complete assessment of neural respiratory drive [40].",

Even though \u0394Pes at increasing PEEP levels did not correlate with changes in the electrical activity of the diaphragm in ARDS patients in one study [27], driving transpulmonary pressure during active inspiration largely depends on \u0394Pes in presence of high respiratory effort and could be quite difficult to predict when monitoring only the airway pressure [42]. The pressure generated by the respiratory muscles (Pmus) is computed as the difference between the static recoil pressure of the chest wall and \u0394Pes. Pmus values higher than 10 cmH2O might indicate high effort [43]. The negative airway pressure generated by occlusion occurring during the first 0.1 s of an inspiration, known as P0.1, is commonly used as an index of respiratory drive [44]. In healthy subjects, P0.1 varies between 0.5 and 1.5 cmH2O. P0.1 values consistently above 3\u20134 cmH2O indicate high neural respiratory drive and high work of breathing [45, 46]. P0.1 depends on the integrity of neuromuscular transmission. However, as compared with other indices based on breathing effort, it is not affected by moderate reductions of respiratory muscle strength, therefore, representing a reliable index of respiratory drive even in patients with muscular weakness [47].",

In healthy subjects, increases in ventilatory demand are met by initial increases in Vt with constant inspiratory time (Ti), resulting in high mean inspiratory flow (Vt/Ti), that reflects high drive [48\u201350]. Similarly, high Vt (and high Vt/Ti) in spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS suggest dangerous increases in respiratory drive both during noninvasive [51] and invasive mechanical ventilation [52]. Increased respiratory rate occurs only when respiratory drive is three to four times higher than normal and it is detected by an increased ratio of Ti and total breath duration (Ti/Ttot) [49, 50]. However, decreased respiratory compliance [53] and muscular weakness may limit the increase in Vt in ARDS [54]. Increased neural respiratory drive could then lead to early increases in respiratory rate with decreased Ti [55] and the rapid shallow breathing index (respiratory rate divided by tidal volume) [56] might indicate high drive with unsatisfied ventilatory demand.",

While measurements closer to the brain centres more reliably reflect the neural drive, downstream parameters (namely the amplitude and the rate of changes in lung volume and pressure that result in ventilation) provide information about the magnitude of lung stress generated by spontaneous ventilation, which is the determinant of P-SILI [58]. Dyspnea results from the imbalance between load and muscle capacity or from the imbalance between motor output and lung expansion [59]. The complex neural network involved in dyspnea receives afferent information on the respiratory motor output from the brainstem and the motor cortex [60], as well as multiple sensory feedbacks from the chemoreceptors and the mechanoreceptors of the lung and chest wall [61]. The perception of dyspnea depends on the integration of this motor and sensory information, modulated by emotion [62]. Therefore, bedside assessment of dyspnea could allow estimation of the distance between brain and ventilation curves.",

Patient\u2013ventilator asynchronies due to high inspiratory effort such as double triggering can also lead to high tidal volume [65]. Even in the presence of protective Vt and pressure, regional injury can still occur because of increased local stress in dependent atelectatic lung regions due to the solid-like behaviour of the diseased lung. In addition, decrease of pleural pressure generated by diaphragmatic contraction is larger in the dependent lung regions drawing air from non-dependent regions before ventilator flow reaches the alveoli (i.e., occult pendelluft phenomenon) [66]. Distribution of tidal volume within the lungs is usually more homogenous during spontaneous breathing as compared to controlled ventilation, but too high effort can lead to ventilation heterogeneity with a larger portion of tidal volumes reaching dependent regions. The increased negative pleural pressure during forceful breathing effort also increases transmural vascular pressure, which promotes additional pulmonary oedema due to increased lung perfusion and lower alveolar pressure [67].",

However, unprotective levels of ventilation should not be tolerated in order to comply with the patient respiratory drive during PSV: switching back to controlled ventilation might be safer when inspiratory plateau pressure is higher than 30 cmH2O, Vt greater than 6\u20138 ml/kg predicted body weight and high levels of FiO2 (e.g., > 80%) are needed [58]. Alternative modes of assisted ventilation with non-fixed support proportional to diaphragm electrical activity [80] or to a desired range of work of breathing performed by the patient [81] are emerging as possibly safer alternatives to increase support without risking excessive additional lung injury. Indeed, during these modes, the drive decreases when support by the ventilator is increased, but, at the same time, the Vt and inspiratory pressure increases only up to a point below safe thresholds, likely because of preserved reflexes limiting lung volumes. Finally, artificially introducing some variability within the respiratory pattern by noisy pressure support [82] or by cyclic large breaths (i.e., using \u201csighs\u201d) [83] has been shown to safely modulate increased respiratory drive, by improving oxygenation or respiratory mechanics, or through the Hering\u2013Breuer effect, or all the above.",

Opioids are widely used in the ICU for analgo-sedation but only few studies have assessed their effects on respiratory drive. Remifentanyl decreases respiratory rate and increases expiratory timer without modifying EAdi in critically ill patients on assisted ventilation [88].

The metabolic hyperbola is the relationship between ventilation and the resultant PaCO2 for a given level of metabolic CO2 production and dead space. Increased dead space or CO2 production will shift the hyperbola up. The ventilation curve describes the actual effect of changing PaCO2 on resultant minute ventilation. ARDS can shift the ventilation curve to the right (lower minute ventilation despite higher PaCO2) due to increased respiratory load and muscle weakness. Finally, the brain curve (also known as the \"controller curve\", \"CO2 sensitivity curve\" or \"ventilation gain curve\") describes the minute ventilation theoretically requested by the neural respiratory drive for a given PaCO2. During ARDS, this is shifted to the left (higher minute ventilation despite lower PaCO2) due to multiple concomitant pathologic conditions, including acidosis, inflammation and others. a In health, brain and ventilation curves overlap and the ventilation response (i.e., the change in minute ventilation induced by a change in PaCO2) reflects the neural respiratory drive. The metabolic hyperbola is obtained assuming a dead space of 0.3 and a metabolic CO2 production (VCO2) of 200 ml/min. Brain and ventilation curves are overlapping and are calculated assuming at PaCO2 of 39.5 mmHg, a ventilation of 6.5 l/min, linearly increasing to 30 l/min at a PaCO2 of 49 mmHg. b In ARDS, the metabolic hyperbola is shifted upward due to increase of dead space (0.5) and VCO2 (250 ml/min). The listed factors cause the brain and ventilation curves to be shifted in opposite directions and diverge. Please, note that a single ARDS patient will be characterized by both curves at the same time: the brain curve will correspond to the theoretical ventilation/PaCO2 correlation desired by the neural respiratory drive, while the ventilation curve will be the actual ventilation/PaCO2 correlation measured by spirometer and blood gas analysis. Brain and ventilation curves are calculated assuming a ventilation of 6.5 l/min at 28 mmHg PaCO2 (increasing to 30 l/min at 33 mmHg PaCO2) and a ventilation of 5 l/min at 40 mmHg PaCO2 (increasing to 25 l/min at 52 mmHg PaCO2), respectively",
