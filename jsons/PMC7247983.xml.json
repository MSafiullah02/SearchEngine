A total of 1,484 HCWs, including 287 doctors, 537 nurses, and 660 administrative staff work in the hospital. Moreover, there are several outpatient clinics and hemodialysis unit as well as other clinics. The emergency department serves about a half of the population of the third biggest city in Turkey. As of May 12, 2020, we had 55 confirmed COVID-19 pediatric cases, and additionally 230 suspected COVID-19 cases were hospitalized at the center. To the date this review was submitted, four of the HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19, while no one was attributable to hospital exposure (the source of infection was generally their spouse or roommates).",

However, as the number of cases began to increase within ten days, additional wards as well as a room with ventilation system separated from the rest of the rooms in the pediatric intensive care unit were allocated. The shifts of the staff working at the COVID-19 wards and other HCWs were strictly separated from each other in order to reduce the HCWs contact with COVID-19 patients and indirect transmission and to reduce PPE usage. Moreover, the elective surgeries and outpatient appointments were postponed with the exceptions of appointments for retinopathy of prematurity in ophthalmology unit, daily chemotherapies for pediatric hematology-oncology patients and also the intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapies for congenital immunodeficiency patients.",

In the first twenty days of the pandemic in Turkey, medical masks were only given to the parents and children with fever, whereas later everyone entering the outpatient clinics was requested to wear medical masks. Additionally, only one caregiver with medical mask was allowed to enter the examination room.\nThe triage was performed according to the algorithm demonstrated in Figure 1\n, where the possible COVID-19 patients were examined by fully equipped clinicians (pediatricians and a pediatric infectious diseases specialist as a supervisor) on the ground floor. The patients who did not meet the COVID-19 criteria were transferred to the upper floors. The radiology (chest x-ray) and phlebotomy team was placed also on the ground floor and dedicated only to COVID-19 patients. This shift continued from 08.00 a.m. until to 04.00 p.m.\ni\nEmergency departments: The ground floor front desk for triage described above from 04.00 p.m. until 08.00 a.m. in line with the same criteria except one; during this shift the patients without fever and/or cough were directly transferred to the emergency room for physical examination. The COVID-19 patients who needed hospitalization were immediately admitted to inpatient clinics and the patients who required monitoring for transient duration were transferred to isolation rooms arranged in emergency department. The emergency department was divided into two separate sections according to probable COVID-19 positive or negative patients. The patients with suspected COVID-19, who required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, were immediately transferred to the inpatient clinics.ii\nReferral from other centers: Since the current hospital is a referral center for pediatric COVID-19 patients, nearly half of the COVID-19 patients were referred from other hospitals. Depending on the clinical status of the patient, these patients were directly transferred to the COVID-19 ward without entering any other part of the hospital. The staff would get ready with their PPE following their direct communication with the transfer ambulance before admission.iii\nThe organization of the COVID-19 wards: Three specific wards were arranged and classified according to the risks of COVID-19 patients as high, moderate and low. The other remaining wards were designated COVID-19 free pediatric wards where only patients without fever and any respiratory symptoms were admitted. Pediatric infectious diseases ward was the only ward that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases were hospitalized. The patients with respiratory symptoms and fever in which COVID-19 possibility was nullified by molecular assays were transferred to the other two low-risk wards.\n",

Unlike the general hospitals, the children's hospital may require certain specific measures worth mentioning:iBefore the pandemic, there was only one entrance to the ward used both by the patients and the HCWs. A second entrance dedicated for use by HCWs was built.iiHealthcare workers were made to wear scrubs which were washed at the hospital after use and they were not allowed to go out with scrubs on.iiiIn the clinical practice, after the first examination of the children with COVID-19, the parent/caregiver and the child were immediately transferred to the patient's room and all information required to fill the forms such as additional information about family history, complaints of the child, etc. were taken by the nurse on the phone.ivHealthcare workers wore full PPE including N95 masks.vBefore the pandemic, there was an open food court shared by all HCWs. However, during the pandemic phase, to observe the recommended social distancing and to prevent possible transmission from unknown viral spreaders, HCWs had food delivered in disposable closed lunch boxes at the locations they work.viIn every patient room, patient-specific stethoscopes were placed to prevent possible transmission via fomites and wall-clocks (for evaluating the patients\u2019 heart rate as well as respiratory rate) were installed as HCWs were not allowed to use their personal belongings in the COVID-19 patient rooms.viiThe children who require high-flow nasal cannula or conventional oxygen therapy were immediately transferred to negative pressure isolation room when available. As there was only one such room at the hospital, aerosol-generating procedures had to be conducted in regular rooms taking the necessary measures such as fully-equipped HCWs donning N95 or N99 masks (45).viiiBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the young children and infants who required salbutamol inhalation via nebulizer were kept together in the same area in the emergency service. During the pandemic, this practice was discontinued and a metered dose inhaler via a holding chamber or spacer was used instead. The reusable holding chambers and the outer parts of the nebulizer were sterilized with vaporized hydrogen peroxide and stored as a sterile package (image 1\n).ixLiving spaces and resting areas of HCWs were strictly separated from the patients\u2019 area and no personal belongings were allowed in the patients\u2019 area.xWhen a child with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was discharged from the ward, firstly disinfection was performed with a multifunctional UV disinfection robot with air-cleaning properties and then all surfaces in the room were physically cleaned (image 2\n). All furniture, equipment, and frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles) were cleaned with a physical cleaning agent using 1,000 ppm bleach solution (2 in 1) made up daily from a concentrated solution. This cleaning technique was applied in all rooms where suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases were hospitalized.\n",

Particularly for the HCWs performing aerosol generating procedures, N95 respirators were provided. Aerosol generating procedures were listed as procedures including collecting diagnostic respiratory samples (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab), endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, physical prone positioning of the patient, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation including tracheal intubation, bronchial suctioning, bronchoscopy, and sputum induction (45). According to the guidelines, these masks were allowed to be used for 8 hours for multiple patients without removing, unless the respirator is damaged, soiled or contaminated (46).iiiHealthcare workers collecting diagnostic respiratory samples were required to wear gloves, gowns and N95 masks at COVID-19 wards. The HCWs at the other remaining wards were required to wear surgical masks while managing the COVID-19 free patients.ivStock levels of PPEs were daily monitored by an inventory management software program. According to the use of PPEs, new products obtained immediately once the stocks declined to a certain levelvAvailability of PPEs for all HCWs was assessed at the point-of-care. Five sets of equipment of PPE including N95 masks, gowns, gloves, and face shields were prepared for the emergency department, outpatient clinics and wards that COVID-19 patients admitted. These sets are ready to use sets reserved for resuscitation.viAfter an aerosol-generating procedure with a confirmed case, all PPEs were disposed off in a trash receptacle except the face shields which were sterilized for reuse.\n",
