Every 1\u00b0C increase in AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in 67% to 85.5% and every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was 5.04\u00b0C to 8.2\u00b0C.

There was also a statistically significant effect of AT in Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Liaoning, and Jilin in addition to Hubei. However, AT showed an opposite effect in the nearby provinces of Hubei and two provinces in northeast China. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by fixing ARH at its 25th and 75th percentiles (Figs.

Fig. 5 shows the IRRs for ARH in association with COVID-19 when AT was fixed at its median for each province. Unlike Hubei province, other provinces including Henan, Anhui, and Chongqing had a positive relationship between ARH and COVID-19. The estimates of IRRs and the forest plots of the ARH with AT fixed at its 25th and 75th percentiles as a sensitivity analysis are presented in Figs.

The longer the study period, the more stable the model results are expected to be. Considering the incubation period of COVID-19, we used the 14-day EMA of daily AT and ARH to investigate the effects of ARH and AT on COVID-19. Most of the confirmed cases (and therefore meteorological data) were derived from the period before travel restrictions were enacted for Wuhan city (January 23, 2020); therefore, the Hubei model most likely reflected the real (unconfounded) effect of meteorological factors on COVID-19, where negative correlations between AT and ARH and the incidence of COVID-19 were found. Evidence from previous epidemiological studies and laboratory investigations have documented negative associations between ARH and AT and other coronavirus-related diseases (Chan et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2019; Zhang Qiang et al., 2004) . One study reported that the risk of an increased daily incidence of SARS was 18.18 (95% CI: 5.6-58.8) times greater at lower temperature during the outbreak than on warmer days (Lin et al., 2006) . SARS-CoV (Cai et al., 2003) and MERS-CoV (Gardner et al., 2019; van Doremalen et al., 2013) are more stable in cold and dry conditions; low temperature and low humidity lead to an increase of suspended matter in the atmosphere, facilitating ideal conditions for virus attachment, replication and transmission, while low temperature can also dry out the mucous membrane, reduce the function of cilia, and support the survival and transmission of the virus and the spread of diseases (Casanova et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Guionie et al., 2013; Lowen and Palese, 2009; Tan et al., 2005) .",

In Hubei province, the interaction between ARH and AT was found to have a positive effect on transmission (0.04, 95% CI: 0.004-0.07). Increased AT (ARH) led to a decreased effect of ARH (AT) on the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei province. The exact mechanism of the interaction is unclear. One probable reason might be that a combination of low AT and humidity make the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, creating opportunities for virus invasion (Zhou and Jiang, 2004) . A previous study observed an interaction between minimum temperature and humidity on influenza (Firestone et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019) . However, previous studies have seldom analyzed the effects of the interaction of meteorological factors, focusing on the single effect of humidity or temperature on the development of COVID-19 Wang et al., 2020) . Hence, when estimating the impact of climate on the risk of COVID-19 transmission, the interaction between meteorological factors should be considered. Research findings on meteorological factors and their interactions should be incorporated into the prevention and control of COVID-19. With the arrival of spring in China, the increased AT in the southern region might lead to a decrease in the incidence of the disease. Conversely, in northern regions with continuing low ATs and low ARH levels there should be more attention given to monitoring and prevention of COVID-19 due to continuing suitable climatic conditions in these regions.",

The between-region variability of meteorological factors is likely the main reason for the heterogeneity of effects. Small sample size in some provinces leads to model instability and invalid estimates. Most of the daily counts of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei included in our models (68.6%) (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020) were identified as imported cases from Hubei province or cases having a close contact with imported cases for the study period. Meteorological factors mainly affect COVID-19 transmission by affecting the survival of the coronavirus in the environment, and we assume that the coronavirus was unlikely to exist in the environment in other provinces, where most cases were imported during the study period. The city of Wuhan was forced to shut down both outbound and inbound traffic on January 23, 2020, and other provinces then also gradually placed restrictions on the movement of their populations. These intervention measures are expected to also have an important impact on the associations between meteorological factors and the transmission of the virus. However, because of the interventions that were progressively imposed during January and February 2020, the least biased (confounded) time series of COVID-19 cases is that derived from Wuhan and Hubei province, which showed a negative relationship between AT and ARH and cases, with a positive interaction between AT and ARH.",

Second, the incidence of COVID-19 in provinces other than Hubei was more likely to be influenced by interventions after the outbreak in Hubei province. In addition, the meteorological data were collected from the Weather Underground for the capital city for each province only, and data accuracy and representativeness can be improved in future studies.
