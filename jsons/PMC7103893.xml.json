As of this writing, a total of 77,272 cases including 2597 deaths have been reported in China. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, COVID-19 belongs to a distinct clade of beta-coronavirus similar to human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two species outbreaking in the latest decade and causing severe human deaths [2]. Despite the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS or MERS, the scale of the COVID-19 contagion has caused more casualties than either of them as of this writing [3]. In addition, human to human transmission of COVID-19 has been confirmed [4]. A number of cases of COVID-19 infection has been reported by investigators who described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients [5\u20138]. However, there is a limited number of detailed analysis on cytokines, blood chemicals or viral mRNA clearance rate on discharged patients.",

Information including demographic data, exposure history, clinical signs and symptoms, underling comorbidities, medical treatment, laboratory parameters were collected.

Approximately 48 patients (51%) were the patients aged \u2264 40 years, including 2 children under 3 years.

But none of them were exposed to the Huanan seafood market. According to our research, 36 of the 94 patients (38%) were associated with familial clusters. There was no significant difference among mild, moderate or severe group of patients by their epidemiology history.

Linear regression analysis was used to study the association between serum LDH or CK concentrations and PCR negative conversion rate.

This phenomenon promoted us to analyze the correlation between COVID-19 clearance ratio and each of these parameters.",

A couple of therapeutic interventions for coronavirus were investigated during the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [11, 12], and combination of ribavirin and interferon has been proved beneficial in patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection [13, 14]. In addition, the potent efficacy of remdesivir [15], lopinavir and ritonavir [16], as well as intravenous immunoglobulin [17, 18] have been documented for MERS-CoV treatment. As previously reported, early administration of interferon protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV infection, while late administration of exogenous interferon promoted the proinflammatory cytokine response and inhibited the optimal virus-specific T cell response [19, 20]. In this cohort, 89% of the patients were hospitalized in 7 days after onset and 71% of them were treated with interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir, or combined with ribavirin. As showed in our study, COVID-19 mRNA conversion time was correlated with the hospital stay length in both IFN-\u03b1 + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-\u03b1 + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin treatment group, indicating that these two therapeutic regimens might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19 infected patients.",
