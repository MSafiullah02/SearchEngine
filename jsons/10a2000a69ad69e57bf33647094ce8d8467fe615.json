WSV seeks to strengthen and support both virological research and virologists who conduct research of viruses that affect humans, other animals, plants, and other organisms. One of the objectives of WSV is to connect virologists worldwide and support collaboration. Fulfilling this objective, virologists from fourteen countries in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East met on 25-27th August 2019 in Stockholm, Sweden at the Karolinska University Hospital for the first Committee Meeting of WSV. This meeting included compelling keynote and honorary speeches and a series of 18 scientific talks were given encompassing a diverse array of subjects within virology. Followed by the scientific session, a business session was held where multiple aspects and next steps of the society were discussed and charted out.",

Abdel-Moneim (Taif University, Saudi Arabia and Beni-Suef University, Egypt) who outlined the origin of the WSV, the stages of foundation, and the recruitment of volunteer teams for different committees. He also outlined the expansion of the WSV from the few early members to the current 920 members from more than 80 countries. He also paid homage to the late Managing Committee Member, Prof. Michael G. Rossmann (30 July 1930-14 May 2019; Purdue University), and acknowledged his role in attracting scientists to join the WSV (Fig. 3 ).",

Following these two presentations, a series of sessions concerning the future plans for WSV were conducted. The board members discussed the WSV Bylaws and the election of WSV officers. The Bylaws draft and the election criteria and rules have since been approved after extensive modifications. The election is planned to start in the end of-November 2019, when an election call is submitted to all WSV members.
