Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO), while acknowledging that infectious respiratory droplets are widely liberated when COVID-19 patients cough, does not believe that airborne transmission plays any significant role in the transmission of COVID-19 [1] . Given that respiratory droplets travel through the air and are therefore technically 'airborne', this might appear at first sight to be a contradictory position to take. However, for many years the medical profession has drawn a clear distinction between diseases where transmission occurs via respiratory droplets impacting on the nasal and oral mucosae or conjunctiva, and those caused by the inhalation of small aerosol particles <5 or 10 \u03bc m in diameter (known as droplet nuclei) which are capable of reaching the alveoli in the lungs. The former involve large droplets, which once emitted are generally thought to fall rapidly to the floor, travelling <2 m horizontally from the source, whereas the latter, which includes tuberculosis (TB), is associated with droplet nuclei that are so small that they can remain suspended in air for hours, often travelling considerable distances. This distinction is important, because it forms the basis of the WHO social distancing guidelines regarding COVID-19, that require the general public should maintain a distance >1 m between individuals [1] .",

For example, it has been shown that droplets as large as 100 \u03bc m will evaporate in normal room conditions to become droplet nuclei before they can reach the floor [12] [13] [14] . Consequently, relatively large respiratory droplets, which may contain many viral particles, can rapidly reduce in size to become small droplet nuclei that can be suspended in the air and thus widely dispersed on room air currents. Indeed, some researchers investigating airborne transmission of respiratory viruses have found the greatest viral load to be associated with small droplet nuclei. For example, Bischoff et al [15] found that up to 89% of influenza viruscarrying particles in a healthcare setting were <4.7 \u03bc m in diameter, while Lindsley et al [16] , investigating cough droplets produced by influenza patients, found 65% of the viral RNA to be in particles <4 \u03bc m, with airborne RNA recovered from 81% of the patients tested. Others have found similar results [17, 18] . Given that it has been shown that when individuals cough the vast majority of the many particles produced end up as droplet nuclei suspended in the air, with an estimated 99% of particles being <10 \u03bc m in diameter [19] , there is need to better understand the role that aerosol particles might play in the transmission of COVID-19.",

            "text": "While numerous texts refer to large droplets and small droplet nuclei, there is considerable confusion in the literature as to what actually constitutes each of these two classes. Earlier researchers, Wells [12] and Duguid [20] defined large droplets as having a diameter >100 \u03bc m, very much in line with the experimental work relating to droplet evaporation [13] . However, in more recent years >10 \u03bc m has often been used [10, 21, 22] , although >5 \u03bc m has now become the accepted criteria [1, 23] . This classification being primarily based on the fact that droplet nuclei must be <10 \u03bc m in order to reach the alveoli in the lungs [10] . As such, this has led to the ludicrous situation where respiratory particles of say 15 \u03bc m diameter, which take approximately 5 minutes to fall 2 m is still air and thus can be easily transported on room air currents [24, 25] , are classified as large droplets and wrongly assumed not to become airborne. [13, 24] , it is highly likely that the 'droplets' that infected individuals in this outbreak were much less than 100 \u03bc m in diameter, in which case they could have become truly airborne as implied in subsequent analysis of the outbreak [3] . As such, it may be the case that airborne transmission of COVID-19 is being ruled out due to an incorrect understanding of the definition of 'airborne', and that in fact the aerial dissemination of respiratory droplets <100 \u03bc m in diameter is contributing to the transmission of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces. Indeed, recent work demonstrating that coughs and sneezes produce gas plumes [27] that can transport droplets and droplet nuclei many meters [5, 11] , suggests that droplet nuclei containing SARS-CoV-2 virions might be widely distributed in enclosed spaces if infectors are present.",

We therefore decided to use existing published data on respiratory exhalation events (REEs) in our models; that is, data relating to the liberation of respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei during coughing and speaking. To this end, we used datasets acquired by Loudon and Roberts [28] , Duguid [20] , Chao et al. [29] , and Xie et al. [30] relating to droplet size distributions produced by healthy individuals when speaking and coughing. These four datasets were utilized because they all measured the droplet production associated with speaking by asking subjects to count from 1 to 100, and as such, were broadly comparable. Furthermore, with exception of Loudon and Roberts [28] , all the researchers utilized the same size class intervals when presenting their distribution results, thus allowing direct comparisons between the datasets to be made. [30] , who reported the percentages for each size class, the percentage values presented in Table 1 were computed directly from the quantitative data reported in the various study papers [20, [28] [29] [30] . The values shown for Loudon and Roberts [28] were adjusted using the methodology presented by Nicas et al [21] , which assumed that the diameter of droplets at origin was twice that of the diameter measured remotely on sample plates.",

This involved aggregating the published experimental data and computing a theoretical distribution for the total number of respiratory droplets liberated during speaking and coughing. This was done by fitting standard distributions (i.e. lognormal, Weibull and normal) to the data using the 'fitdistrplus' package in R [33] , with the best-fit being the one that exhibited the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC). Random samples from the fitted distribution were then used in the various stochastic simulations to mimic the variance in droplet production that might be encountered in real life. For each simulation, the fraction of droplets <100 \u03bc m in diameter, f <100 , exhaled during a REE was computed by randomly sampling a vector containing the 100 \u03bc m diameter cut-off percentages derived from the four study datasets shown in Table 1 . Having done this, the total number of droplets <100 \u03bc m in diameter, N <100 , liberated in any given simulation was computed using: ( 1) Where: N t is the number of respiratory droplets exhaled during the REE, whose value was determined by randomly sampling the best-fit distribution as described above.",

This is despite being out of the range of ballistic respiratory droplets, which are generally thought not to travel more than 2 m. In reality the amount inhaled will of course depend on many factors, including: the time spent in each other's presence; the ventilation rate; the number of times that REEs occur; and the quantity and distribution of any respiratory particles produced by each REE. Therefore, the simulation results should be treated as a first approximation and should be considered indicative only. However, notwithstanding these limitations, they appear to have value because they imply that if someone with COVID-19 is present in an enclosed space, others in that space are at risk of inhaling appreciable numbers of particles, some of which might bear SARS-CoV-2 virions, even when practicing social distancing.

While the minimum infectious dose necessary to cause a COVID-19 infection is not known, it has been recently shown that the average virus RNA load in the sputum of hospitalised COVID-19 patients is 7.00 \u00d7 10 6 copies per mL, rising to a maximum of 2.35 \u00d7 10 9 copies per mL [36] . If we apply this average value to the results of the analysis presented in Table 3 , it suggests that on average a subject infected with COVID-19 would exhale a total of 38423 viral copies (Table 4) , then at a rough estimate it would mean that at least one viral copy would be present in All rights reserved.

However, this is unlikely because the larger aerosol particles are likely to contain more viral copies than the smaller ones. Also, we cannot be sure that individuals who are asymptomatic, or who display mild COVID-19 symptoms, will exhibit the same viral load as hospitalised patients, although it has been found that symptomatic and asymptomatic patients display similar viral loads [37] . So crude calculations of this nature are unlikely to be correct. Nevertheless, despite being simplistic, the calculation does suggest that a substantial proportion of the aerosolised respiratory droplets liberated during a cough or speaking will contain SARS-CoV-2 virus copies. As such, this appears to support Stadnytskyi et al's [6] estimate that the probability of a 50 \u03bc m diameter droplet, prior to dehydration, containing at least one virion is approximately 37%. If the independent action hypothesis (IAH), which states that each virion has an equal, nonzero probability of causing an infection [38] , is applicable to COVID-19 infection in humans, then in theory the inhalation of the numbers of respiratory particles reported in Table 4 , should be enough to seed COVID-19 infection in a proportion of the individuals exposed. However, the extent to which the IAH is valid for humans and SARS-CoV-2 has not been established, although it has been shown that the IAH applies to systems where the host is highly susceptible to the disease [39] .",

Because they were undiagnosed and displayed no obvious symptoms, there was nothing to alert susceptible individuals to any threat. Consequently, it is likely that no evasive action would be taken, other than social distancing, with the result that over the course of a typical working week, susceptible individuals in the vicinity of the asymptomatic person, would be exposed to many hundreds of aerosol particles that might contain SARS-CoV-2 virions. As such, our model suggests that undiagnosed COVID-19 positive individuals who are either asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic play an important role in the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in buildings and other enclosed spaces, even when social distancing is observed. Indeed, given that live coronavirus is thought to be shed in high concentrations from the nasal cavity of COVID-19 positive individuals before symptoms develop [37, 40, 41] , this finding is perhaps unsurprising. There is strong evidence that many infected individuals who transmit COVID-19 are either minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic [40, 42, 43] , and while much of this transmission will occur through either direct contact or the action of ballistic droplets, our findings suggest that aerosolised All rights reserved.

In the simulations shown in figures 3 and 4, we assumed that the infectious and susceptible individuals shared the same space for just one hour. In reality however, in a work place situation or, say, on a long journey in a vehicle, the two might be in the same vicinity for many hours, in which case the risk of one acquiring an infection from the other will greatly increase [44] . Similarly, if we placed multiple air samples in a room space containing an infectious person, then it would be much more likely that one or more of the samplers would return a positive result compared to the situation were a single sampler was used. In other words, if we were to place say ten susceptible individuals in the office space in our simulation, then it would be much more likely that at least one might become infected within the hour. As such, this suggests that it is important to maintain low occupancy densities within enclosed spaces, as well as managing occupancy levels so that likelihood of susceptibles and unidentified infectors sharing a room space for any length of time is minimized [45] .",

This ambiguity unfortunately all too often results in polarized views and a loss of nuance. So for example, influenza A, which shares some similar transmission characteristics to COVID-19, is classified as a disease that is spread by droplet transmission, despite the fact that numerous studies have shown that influenza RNA has been recovered from droplet nuclei <5 \u03bc m in diameter, either directly from influenza patients [15, 16, 18] , or from the air in healthcare facilities [17] and other settings [48, 49] .

Of particular note, Coleman and Sigler also found that the viral RNA was concentrated in droplet nuclei <4 \u03bc m in diameter, rather than larger 'droplets', a finding mirrored by other researchers [15, 16, 18] . This is interesting because early studies on influenza in humans found that illness could be induced with substantially lower virus titers when administered as a small droplet aerosol rather than by nasal droplets, suggesting that infection is induced more efficiently when virus is deposited in the lower respiratory tract rather than the upper respiratory tract [52] . If this is the case, then it might be that with influenza, small virus laden droplet nuclei pose a greater threat than larger droplets, or at least contribute to the spread of the disease [53] .

Indeed, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable in aerosols for up to 3 hours [54]. Aerosol transmission has also been demonstrated for SARS (SARS-CoV-1) [55] [56] [57] , which is closely related to COVID-19. Consequently, there is good reason to believe that aerial dissemination of respiratory droplets <100 \u03bc m together with droplet nuclei might play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19. However, the evidence to support this is only just emerging. For example, Ong et al [58] , who sampled surfaces in hospital rooms containing COVID-19 patients, found extensive fomite contamination for some patient rooms, with air exhaust outlets in particular testing positive. From this they concluded that virus-laden droplet nuclei were being transported on air currents. Air conditioning has also been implicated in an outbreak that occurred in restaurant in Guangzhou, China [26] (as discussed above), where a index patient infected five unrelated diners.",

These particles can be suspended in air for considerable periods of time and thus can be widely dispersed. Although the analysis presented here suggest that airborne transmission of COVID-19 is likely to be occurring, particularly from asymptomatic individuals, the extent to which aerosol particles contribute to the overall burden of the disease is unclear, in part, because of ambiguity and confusion regarding the distinction between droplets and droplet nuclei. Given that unreported airborne transmission of COVID-19 may well be occurring, it is recommended that further detailed work be undertaken to inform public health policy and guidelines on occupancy levels in buildings and other enclosed spaces.

This meant that the best-fit distributions for the total number of droplets produced by the REEs were heavily positively (right) skewed, with skewness values of 0.53 and 0.73 observed for speaking and coughing respectively. So although the mean number of droplets produced during speaking and coughing were 1829 and 1796 respectively, the median values were only 1263 and 874 respectively. As such, these values appear to sit comfortably within the ranges estimated by Chao et al. [29] (i.e. 112-6720 droplets expelled during speaking and 947-2085 droplets were expelled per cough). The results of the office space simulations using the default ventilation rate of 2 AC/h are presented in figures 2-4 and in Table 4. These show that for all scenarios, appreciable numbers of aerosolised respiratory particles originating from the infector were inhaled by the susceptible individual after one hour in the room space. For example, spending one hour in the space after the infector had spoken (Scenario 1) or coughed (Scenario 2) just once, resulted in a median value of 49.7 and 47.7 particles respectively being inhaled. These median values increased to 482.9 and 187.3 respectively for scenarios 3 and 4. From figures 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) it can be seen that distribution of inhaled respiratory particles was highly positively skewed (skewness = 5.68; 4.83; and 3.69 respectively).",
