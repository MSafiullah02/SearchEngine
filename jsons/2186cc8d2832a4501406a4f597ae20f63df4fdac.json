The outbreak is declared as pandemic and public health emergency of international concern declared by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the present health emergency exhibited close resemblance with SARS-CoV. Both the viruses are zoonotic and belong to a large family of viruses Coronaviridae. The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome. The S protein of virus shows similarity to S protein of SARS-CoV. COVID-19 spreads from person to person, and this makes it more vulnerable for causing infection. Several efforts are taken to find prevention strategies for COVID-19. Researchers across the globe are working to find effective vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. There is no vaccine or medication available till date for COVID-19. Preventive measures such as social distancing, awareness, maintenance of hygiene, isolation, and movement restrictions can help in control of COVID-19 spread. Proper sanitization and cleaned and sanitized public transport can be effective in inhibiting the spread of the virus. In the present situation of medical emergency, cooperation and support by following advices from the WHO and government only facilitate everyone to come over.",

Researchers found the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and compared the same with SARS-CoV-1. The experimental data under varied circumstances on different surfaces are found to be similar for both the strains (van Doremalen et al. 2020 ). The experimental observation shows that alterations in the epidemiologic characteristics of both the viruses may arise due to other reasons. The high viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract in the patient and the potential of COVID-19-infected individual to carry and spread the virus while being in asymptomatic condition are some probable reasons for high infection rate, making its control challenging (Bai et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2020) . COVID-19 is a single-stranded (ss) RNA virus consisting of 26-36 kb positive sense RNA genome. The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome (Forni et al. 2017) . The size of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins shows similarity to bat SARS-CoV. The important difference is longer length and structure of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-CoV observed by researchers. These S proteins are very crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion, internalization of the SARS-CoV-2, tissue tropism, and host array. This S protein may be utilized as vital target for vaccine development (Menachery et al. 2016; Ji et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "COVID-19 contains the largest RNA genome and has spike proteins which play very important role in host-virus interaction and infection. After entering into host cells, the viral genome translates into two large precursors, poly-proteins known as PP1a and PP1ab. These precursors further processed by ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases, PL pro (papain-like proteinases) and 3CL pro (3C-like proteinases) into 16 mature non-structural proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp16. These nsps perform several important functions in viral RNA replication and transcription, RNA polymerase, RNA-processing enzymes such as poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease, protease, helicase, 3 0 -5 0 exoribonuclease, ribose 2 0 -O methyltransferase, adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 00 -phosphatase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Narayanan et al. 2015) . Additionally, these nsps have a major role in viral RNA replication and transcription. Due to the absence of proofreading mechanism during RNA recombination process in pre-existed coronaviruses strains, it may account to be responsible for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The S gene-encoding spike glycoproteins have the maximum recombination frequency (Ji et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020) . Out of the three major proteins forming viral envelope, S and M are glycol proteins and the E is non-glycosylated protein. M and E proteins are essential for virus assembly, morphogenesis, and budding. The M protein comprises short N terminal glycosylated ectodomain with a long C terminal domain and three membrane domains. On the other hand, S glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein which includes two heptad repeat regions HR-N and HR-C and forms protein ectodomainsurrounded coiled structure. Additionally, the S protein cleaves into two subunits S1 and S2 and facilitates receptor binding (at domain 270-510) and membrane fusion, respectively (Tripet et al. 2004; Yuen et al. 2007; Fehr and Perlman 2015; Narayanan et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2020; Wan et al. 2005) . Considering the importance of S protein in attachment with host cell and variation in sequence of S protein from SARS-CoV-1, S protein may be considered potential candidate for vaccine development. Systematic assessment identified that 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-1, SARS like bat CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for functional and pathogenic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 .",

It shows the severity of COVID-19 and its high infection rate especially in elderly and immunocompromised or weak immunity individuals. Several pharmaceutical R&D units and researchers are working to develop vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Researchers are putting all efforts to find a solution for combating this novel coronavirus. Researchers across the globe are trying to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using approaches like whole virus vaccine, antibody vaccine, DNA vaccine, recombinant protein subunit vaccine, and mRNA vaccine (Dresden 2020) . Currently, there is no approved vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, mRNA 1273 investigational vaccine has been developed by NIAID scientists in collaboration with the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, MA. The clinical trial began at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, and part of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial on mRNA platform approved for human trial after its promising response in animal models (NIH). A team of researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, reported high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV (outbreak in 2003) and SARS-CoV-2. This genetic similarity leads researchers to determine experimental data for SARS-CoV-1 B-cell and T-cell epitopes derived from S and N proteins which map identically to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the non-structural proteins, the T-cell response against the structural proteins has been reported to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovering SARS-CoV patients. Additionally, T-cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (Li et al. 2008; Channappanavar et al. 2014; Ahmed et al. 2020) . As no mutation was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and long-lasting T-cell response against S protein, immune targeting of these epitopes may provide protection against COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (Ahmed et al. 2020) . Similar study was also reported by researchers from CFAR, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, in which researchers found glycosylated S protein site as potential target for vaccine development due to the genetic similarity with SARS-CoV and Bat CoV (Kumar et al. 2020) . Table 11 .2 comprise of some of the vaccines under development in various pharma and R&D laboratories with the stage of vaccine.",

Various types of coronavirus vaccines are under research like inactivated coronavirus, live attenuated coronavirus, S-protein-based, vectored vaccines, DNA vaccines, and combination vaccines. Vaccines for combating several animal-based CoVs have been developed and demonstrated to be efficient in averting viral contagion. Vaccines for human CoVs, especially deadly SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the present pandemic COVID-19, are under development in various levels of preclinical, subclinical, and clinical trials. The study of virus-like particle vaccine in mice and whole virus vaccine in non-human primates and ferrets exhibits immune response against CoV infection, but later on vaccinated animals unveiled immunopathological lung disease (Tseng et al. 2012) . Another study in canine CoV vaccine exhibited that the vaccination with inactivated CoV can expressively reduce the viral replication followed with the reduction in occurrence of clinical symptoms and disease due to virulent CoV infection (Fulker et al. 1995) . In a study carried out on rhesus monkey with SARS-CoV, inactivated vaccine exhibited effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection. The rhesus monkey was inoculated with a varied dose (0.5, 5, 50, and 5000 \u03bcg) of vaccine and provided with booster dose after a week. Afterwards the animals were exposed to NS-1 strain of SARS-CoV, the vaccinated monkeys had not shown any systematic side effects neither any clinical symptoms. The vaccine in study shows promising results on monkeys and may be further tested under clinical trials on humans (Zhou et al. 2005) .",
