            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly demonstrated the need to accurately evaluate the effects of implementing new or altering existing nonpharmaceutical interventions. Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of relaxing current social distancing measures in Iowa, USA, at various times and to various degrees. R code for our method is provided in the supplementary material, thereby allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions.",

The virus causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 , characterized by fever, cough, shortness of breath and other respiratory or flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, multi-organ dysfunction and death [2] [3] [4] . Since its discovery, the virus has rapidly moved across the globe and in March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. To date, over 4 million cases and nearly 300,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [5] . Nearly all countries have identified COVID-19 cases, with over 90 countries reporting greater than a thousand cases and 22 countries having recorded over a thousand deaths [5] . As the size of the pandemic continues to grow experts expect COVID-19 will pose a significant threat for many months and potentially years. Thus, the burden not just to population health, but also the overall healthcare system, skilled and long-term care, and the global economy are likely to be substantial.",

Consequently, many infectious disease models have been developed to forecast the trajectory of the current epidemic and to understand the likely impact of a range of interventions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Models designed to capture certain aspects of the epidemic (e.g., forecasting mortality) may not be well suited for others (e.g., evaluating policy decision making), and so decision makers have increasingly had to navigate a range of diverse modeling approaches while attempting to find approaches that can meet the specific nature of a given setting [citeDSMRegIHMEReynolds] . In short, decision makers need information on the effects of public policy measures on an epidemic that is both timely and accurate. From a modeler's perspective, this translates into a model which is both computationally efficient and which captures salient features of transmission through a population.",

It focuses on the individuals in the population, but rather than simulating disease over an individual-based model and averaging the results to obtain an estimated epidemic curve, our method directly estimates the probability that a particular individual is infectious at a particular time. Through the use of recursive relationships, the expected number of infected individuals can be efficiently computed at each time point. Like all methods, there are strengths and weaknesses. The strengths of the method include the following. First, it relies on a realistic or observed contact network. This is in contrast to assumptions of homogeneous mixing, or that the contact degree distribution is not heavy tailed (e.g., Poisson). This crucially allows us to capture the effects of superspreaders [31, 32] , burstiness of the epidemic [33, 34] , and other salient features of realistic contact graphs. Second, our approach explicitly captures the way nonpharmaceutical interventions can affect the disease transmission through quarantining/social distancing or reducing the risk that a susceptible-infective contact will lead to a new transmission through, e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE). Third, our approach is computationally efficient and can be run for even large populations with limited computing resources. Unlike many other epidemiological IBMs, our method is easily and quickly deployed (a small R package for implementing this methodology is provided in the supplementary material). Combining all three of these strengths, our method allows a user to quickly explore the effects of public policy changes on social distancing or universal PPE interventions, thereby providing decision makers a timely method of evaluating, for example, when and to what degree social distancing measures should be implemented or relaxed.",

It has been widely regarded that mortality data, while still flawed, presents a much more reliable indicator for the prevalence of COVID-19. We took the number of daily deaths in Iowa current up to May 7, 2020 and used this to estimate the daily number of new infections. This was done in two steps: (1) smoothing the mortality data, and (2) converting this to number of infections. First, we took the daily number of deaths and estimated the expected number of individuals with symptom onsets on each day. This was done by leveraging work by [35] who estimated the time between symptom onset and death (which we will henceforth refer to as SO-Death lag). We matched their results to a negative binomial distribution with a mean of 16.1 days and dispersion parameter equal to 183. Given a maximum SO-Death lag L and a certain number of deaths on day t, call it y t , we can consider each death as a draw from a multinomial distribution where the bins are the preceding L days. Further, from [35] we know the probability that a given case will fall in a certain bin (i.e., day). Hence we have a random variable n(t) such that where Prob(SO-Death lag = ) is from the negative binomial distribution described above. For each t we can compute E(n(t), and then for each day s add the contributed counts from the concurrent day n(s) and each future day n(t) to obtain the expected number of individuals whose symptoms began on day s. To estimate the number of new infections each day, we combined the smoothed mortality data with the infection fatality rate (IFR) estimated at 0.5% by [36] which used data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak. That is, we took the estimated number of new infections each day that would eventually result in a mortality event and scaled by 1/0.005 to obtain the total number of infections. Figure 1 shows the raw daily mortality data as well as the estimated number of new infections as measured by symptom onset. When training our model we shifted these dates back by four days, as this has been the estimated length of the incubation period [35, 37] . In addition, due to the lag between becoming infected and death, the tail of the data is not reliable. We thus trained our model after excluding the last 27 days, which corresponds to the 99 th percentile of the SO-Death lag distribution. This point is marked by a vertical gray line in Figure 1 . Contact graph [38] recruited 1450 individuals from 857 households in Hong Kong into a study on inter-personal contacts, where a contact was defined to be a social encounter which included a \"face-to-face conversation or touch (such as handshake, a kiss, games and sports or similar events involving body touch).\" As was consistent with other studies, [38] found the distribution of contacts to be heavy tailed, which has profound effects in the context of infectious disease as this indicates potential super-spreaders. Overall, individuals had on average 12.5 contacts per day. This matches closely with an ecological momentary assessment study of individuals in upstate New York which found the average number of daily contacts to be 12 [39] . We therefore constructed a contact graph for the \u223c 3.155M Iowans with a degree distribution which resembled that of [38] .",

First, we investigated the effects of reopening at certain stages. Reopening was set to occur adaptively such that if the number of daily infections dropped below a certain proportion of the peak, social distancing measures would be relaxed. Since this relaxation is not likely to occur immediately, we set the quarantine probability to decay according to a Gaussian kernel such that after two weeks the current levels of social distancing/quarantining levels were reduced by 90%. Second, we investigated the effects of reopening for only a portion of the population. This was determined by maintaining the current level of quarantining for those individuals with the highest number of contacts (e.g., healthcare professionals rotating between long term care facilities) while lifting social distancing measures for the remainder of the population.",

We trained our data on the resulting estimates of daily infections, although due to the long delays between infection and death, our training data are effectively only valid up to April 11, 2020 . Based on this, the peak of the current trajectory is estimated to occur around May 28, 2020, although this too will change as social distancing measures are being relaxed throughout parts of the states as of May 1, 2020. The latent period was estimated to be 3 days, which is in line with previous estimates. The infectious period was estimated to be 5 days. While this is considerably shorter than what is currently believed to be the time from symptom onset to recovery (e.g., [40] estimated this to be between 19 and 23 days depending on age), this is close to what has been previously estimated to be the time between symptom onset and isolation; [40] estimated this to be 4.6 days, and [41] estimated this to be 2.9 days. The probability that an individual is quarantined past March 15 (this is the date that the governor of Iowa recommended closing schools and limiting large gatherings [42] ) was estimated to be 0.48. The daily importation probability was estimated at 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; and the basic reproduction number R 0 prior to social distancing was estimated to be 1.3, which translates into a probability that a susceptible-infective contact leads to a new transmission event near 0.02. Figure 2 shows the estimated epicurve to the number of infections both on a daily basis and as a cumulative count.",

First, while reopening at only 95% or 75% of the peak typically leads to an even higher second peak, waiting just a little longer leads to a milder second peak in all cases except when social distancing is relaxed for all individuals. Second, in many cases there is not a dramatic difference in reinstating social distancing and allowing society to remain opened. Third, as expected, by relaxing social distancing for only a subpopulation, the second peaks are reduced, and in the case of relaxing only a strategic half of the population, the effects of reopening are minimal. The estimated current trajectory is given in the pink dashed line, and the trajectories based on reopening at either 95%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 5% of the peak are given in the blue solid lines. In the left column, the current social distancing policies are reimplemented after one week of contiguous increases of daily number of new infections; the right column corresponds to no reimplementation.
