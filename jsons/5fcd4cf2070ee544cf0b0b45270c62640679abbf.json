Physical barriers, such as glass or plastic windows panels, should be used to reduce exposure to the COVID19 virus. This approach can be implemented in areas where patients will first present: triage areas, the registration desk at the clinic or the emergency department. 2. Guards at the gate should wear surgical masks and maintain hand hygiene. Conversation should be carried out from a distance of at least 1 m [21] . 3. Alternate seats can be strapped down the middle with string or tape to ensure distance seating. 4. Waiting in a vehicle is safer than waiting in a clinic. 5. Every ultrasound environment is different [1] . It is unlikely that ultrasound clinics have too many choices in ventilation/air conditioning. It is recommended that single unit air conditioning should be run in an ''open to outside air'' mode (vent open). Clinics will have to decide individually how best to facilitate maximum air change in routine practice. Aerosol generating procedures (AGP) are rare in daily ultrasound practice and should be handled by standard operating procedures by various guidelines [1, 2] . However such AGPs should not be attempted in an ultrasound clinic but in designated centers. 6. All indoor areas such as entrance lobbies, corridors and staircases, escalators, elevators, security guard sinks and toilet soap dispensers should be cleaned with 1% sodium hypochlorite or a phenolic detergent three to four times a day. Taps and metallic surfaces should be cleaned with a sanitiser containing 60-70% alcohol. 14. Outdoor areas have less risk than indoor areas because of air currents and exposure to sunlight. Cleaning and disinfection efforts should be targeted to frequently touched surfaces such as tables and bench handles. 15. Patient examination tables must be covered with sheets (and pillow covers if necessary) that must be changed after each patient. Linen may be disposable as per individual choice. Routine machine-washing with a regular detergent is adequate for non-disposable sheets and pillow covers.
