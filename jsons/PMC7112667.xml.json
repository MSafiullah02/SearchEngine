            "text": "Respiratory viruses are aerosolized through breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing and may become infectious bioaerosols (La Rosa et al., 2013). Infectious bioaerosols have a capability to simultaneously infect a large number of hosts and cause large outbreaks if the source case rapidly sheds large numbers of infectious bioaerosols, as in the case of measles (Riley et al., 1978). In addition, bio-aerosols are able to reproduce the full spectrum of disease at doses much smaller than those required by a large droplet transmission (Tellier, 2009). Alternatively, when a source case sheds very slowly, secondary attack rates are much lower as suggested in an analysis of human rhinovirus transmission by Myatt et al. (2004). Historically, airborne transmissions have been implicated in transmission of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in a jail (Hoge et al., 1994), military barracks (Brundage et al., 1988), office buildings (Myatt et al., 2004), college dormitories (Sun et al., 2011), and residential buildings (Yu et al., 2004). Most significantly, an analyses of household intervention studies suggested that approximately half of within-home influenza A transmission resulted from exposure to fine particle infectious bioaerosols (Cowling et al., 2013). What all of these reports have in common is a high occupant density within rooms. What is less clear is movement of viral aerosols between rooms connected via air pathways, as is well described for transmission of tuberculosis (Nardell et al., 1991).",

Strategies to protect building occupants from infectious bioaerosols should consider ventilation for its ability to dilute bioaerosol concentrations (Ghosh et al., 2015). A review suggested strong evidence to associate building ventilation and the transmission of ARI via bioaerosols (Li et al., 2007). In a Chinese university, prevalence of self-reported common cold \u2265 6 times in a semester was found to be higher (35% compared to 5%) among students living in dormitories with lower mean ventilation rates (1 L/(s person) compared to 5 L/(s person)) (Sun et al., 2011). In U.S. retail stores, a self-reported common cold infection rate was lower by 43% in stores where ventilation rate was greater (0.5 ACH compared to 1.2 ACH) (Zhao et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Since the 1950s, scientists have attempted to quantify a relationship between ventilation rate and infection risk by airborne transmission (Wells, 1955). The efforts resulted in the famous Wells-Riley equation (Wells, 1955, Riley et al., 1978), which has been widely used to demonstrate the impact of ventilation rates on infection risk by airborne transmission with the Poisson distribution (Zhu et al., 2012, Zhu et al., 2013). The Wells-Riley equation is as follows:(1)P=CS=1-exp-IqptQwhere P is the risk of cross infection, C is the number of case to develop infection, S is the number of susceptible subjects, I is the number of infectors, p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of each susceptible subject (m3/h), Q is the room ventilation rate (m3/h), q is the average quantum generation rate produced by one infector (quanta/h) where a quantum of infection is that dose which will on average infect 63% of the exposed, and t is the duration of exposure (h). However, without knowledge of the relationship between exposure to infectious viral aerosols and risk of infection (i.e. viral particles per infectious quantum) for the specified disease, it is not possible to accurately predict risk of infection and optimal ventilation rate. If a proper ventilation rate for airborne infection control is to be derived, in-situ observations of both ventilation and ARI rates are needed in actual buildings.",

It is purposed to investigate ventilation rate impact on the spread of ARI diseases by airborne transmission in two college dormitory buildings at a state university in the U.S. According to the preliminary investigation, the measured average CO2 level was found to be approximately four times higher in a dormitory building with poor ventilation than the average CO2 level in a dormitory building with good ventilation (Heidarinejad et al., 2018). Coupling these CO2 data with the observed viral shedding from 142 influenza cases during 2012\u20132013 season (Yan et al., 2018), the inhalation exposure during an 8-hour night was calculated by a new equation (Rudnick and Milton, 2003) that originated from Eq. (1). The calculation predicted exposure to 6 to 79 infectious particles per person depending on average ventilation rates in these dormitory rooms (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2018). These results confirmed the importance for an in-depth understanding of building ventilation impact on airborne transmission.",

Nevertheless, one of them had a recent major renovation including installation of an outdoor air supplied mechanical ventilation system while the other had undergone a partial renovation a few years earlier with window replacement but no addition of mechanical air supply ventilation, so they were expected to have different rates of outside air entering the buildings. Based on the published literature, differences in ventilation rates should influence the rate of ARIs. Importantly, the set point temperatures for the mechanical air-conditioning systems are the same in these two buildings, i.e. 21 \u00b0C in winter and 23 \u00b0C in summer, in accordance to the university campus energy standards. These two buildings sit adjacent to each other as shown in Fig. 1\n(a), so they are exposed to the same wind conditions presented in Fig. 1(b).",

Students enrolled in three academic programs for freshmen were targeted for recruitment. Those residing in the HVB were in a program sponsored by the engineering college. Targeted residents of the LVB were enrolled in programs sponsored by public health and life sciences colleges. The focus of this paper is on the HVB and LVB where the majority of eligible participants resided. Prior to beginning the study, a list of all eligible participants and their e-mail addresses were obtained from the University Registrar and emails were sent to them inviting them to enroll in the study. A unique URL address was emailed to the students to link them to the online informed consent documentation and a questionnaire which contained questions about their baseline health conditions, vaccination history and other relevant social and behavioral information. The participants that had signed the informed consent documentation were then asked to make an appointment in the research clinic to provide baseline biological specimens (upper-respiratory swabs and blood). A second questionnaire was administered and biological specimen collection visit was conducted at the end of the academic year.",

HOBO sensors can measure CO2 concentrations in the detection range from 0 to 5000 ppm, with an accuracy of \u00b150 ppm, while Paragon CO2 sensors work in the detection range from 0 to 10000 ppm, with an accuracy of \u00b1100 ppm. Overall, 154 CO2 sensors in total were evenly dispersed in the dormitory rooms on the 1st through 4th floors of the HVB, and on the 2nd through 7th floors of the LVB, as shown in an example given in Fig. 2\n. CO2 sensors were placed high on the wall, opposite to the windows and next to the doors, to avoid being near student beds or desks and receiving a direct plume of exhaled CO2. This location creates a possibility for an increased sensitivity to airflow with an open door, but this would be less impactful to the measured CO2 values than direct airflow from a window or exhalation from room occupants. In addition, Gateways/Routers were installed to transfer the data from Paragon sensors to a server. The sensors collected data points every 15 min to conserve batteries and still allow dynamic monitoring in private student dormitory rooms during the four months of the experimentation. The original data collection began in October 2017 and ended in May 2018, which includes test deployments, sensor calibration, and improvements in experimental protocols. Therefore, the data used in the analysis of building ventilation rates and the calibration of the multi-zone models were collected in the final four months of the experimental time period.",

The sensors were put in pressurized chambers for three hours at known CO2 concentrations of 500, 1000, and 5000 ppm. The average steady-state CO2 concentration in the last 10 min was calculated for each known concentration and the points were used to create a linear curve.

A pair of influenza A with onset of symptoms on consecutive days and residing in rooms located across the hallway from each other was identified. Symptom onset was February 6th for the first case and February 7th for the second case. The two cases were further analyzed to model the potential for aerosol spread of influenza A viruses from the room of the case with the earlier onset into the surrounding rooms with multi-zone modeling by introducing influenza A virus (RNA copies) bioaerosols as a contaminant in the model. Analysis of influenza aerosols in exhaled breath and air in healthcare facilities consistently demonstrates the human influenza aerosols are predominantly in the <5 \u00b5m size range (Lindsley et al., 2012, Noti et al., 2012, Milton et al., 2013, Yan et al., 2018). Therefore, in the simulations, bioaerosols were assumed to have an aerodynamic size of <5 \u00b5m, and treated as a gaseous contaminant (Tang et al., 2006). According to the measurement of the clinical-epidemiology team, limit of detection (Armbruster and Pry, 2008) for influenza A virus was 250 virus particles per 30 min sample. The shedding rate was calculated to be 354 viral RNA per hour for the infected occupant in the source room. Considering that influenza may be contagious prior to onset of symptoms, the simulation time period for the spread of infectious bioaerosols was from February 5th to February 7th, 2018. Because we had no information about when the index person stayed in the room, the simulation assumed a continuous source for influenza A virus. The airflow rates were calculated with the LVB model with closed airflow paths and used to map the flow of air and contaminant between the adjacent rooms.",

This process resulted in 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million measurements that represented a success rate of roughly 67% in the data collection effort under a very limited access to the sensors. Fig. 5\nshows data distribution of the CO2 concentrations in the dormitory rooms for both HVB and LVB. In both buildings, the data measured by each sensor greatly varied with the hourly occupancy rates, especially evident in the LVB. As shown in Table 2\n, both the average and standard deviation of CO2 concentrations were lower in the HVB. These results were expected because, assuming constant generation rates, the lower the ventilation rate the higher CO2 concentrations due to a slow process of dilution. In accordance with the local wind conditions shown in Fig. 1(b), the average and standard deviation of CO2 concentrations were higher in the dormitory rooms at the leeward side of LVB. Furthermore, Table 3\nalso shows that the dormitory rooms at the windward side of the building had a better ventilation and lower ARI rates than those at the leeward side of the LVB. It should be noted that, a total of 4546 CO2 concentrations measured by 27 HOBO sensors installed in the LVB dormitory rooms exceeded the upper limit of 5000 ppm. This upper detection limit was met in 0.7% of all useful CO2 data points. Therefore, the variation and the average of CO2 concentrations in the LVB dormitory rooms are slightly underestimated due to the upper detection limit of HOBO sensors being at 5000 ppm.",

In the HVB, with steady outside air supply by the DOAS system, the hourly averaged CO2 concentration for each room were in a repeatable and narrow range throughout the day. In the LVB, infiltration could not provide sufficient outside air to counteract the changes in CO2 source strength, i.e. number of occupants. On weekdays, hourly averaged CO2 concentrations in the LVB rooms and their standard deviations showed a similar variation trend. In the morning, they slowly increased to the peak at around 10 AM. This was more likely to be caused by the increased metabolic activity during waking, not by the increased occupancy. They then decreased as the student left for classes, and started to increase again after 8 PM as most of the students came back their rooms, and finally trended to a stable value after the students fell asleep. The hourly averaged CO2 concentrations and their standard deviations had a similar variation pattern during weekends, but the peak in the morning and the time of onset in CO2 increase during the evening both shifted by one hour ahead. The results were consistent with concept that CO2 generation rates from building occupants generally increases with their physical activity levels (Persily and de Jonge, 2017) and the idea that students usually spent more time in the dormitory and were more active in their dormitory rooms on the weekends. This potentially resulted in a greater exposure risk on the weekends for the students when they were staying in their rooms, because they generated more bioaerosols and had greater inhalation rate.",

These metrics were calculated and presented in Table 4\n. The order of magnitude given for the metrics indicated reliable results for ventilation rates in the two studied dormitory buildings based on the calculated level of model accuracy. In fact, given different modeling assumptions and great difficulties in data collection/calibration at the entire building scale, it is very difficult and therefore rarely reported for the validation of such large-scale multi-zone models.",

Only one HVB dormitory room had a ventilation rate under 9 L/s; in contrast only four of the LVB dormitory rooms had a ventilation rate above 9 L/s. In both buildings, the overall average ventilation rate was determined by the rates in those double rooms because, of all rooms, 85% in the HVB and 73% in the LVB are double rooms. In the HVB, room ventilation rate increased with room occupancy as designed. In contrast, there was no such intentional increase in room ventilation rates with room occupancy in the LVB. Average ventilation rate was a little higher for triple rooms, which are at the corners, marked with \u201c*\u201d in Fig. 3(c). They have three windows while most of dormitory rooms only have one. Furthermore, half of these triple rooms were exposed to the highest wind speeds from the northwest, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).

In addition, many factors, such as the susceptibility to infectious virus (Qui\u00f1ones-Parra et al., 2016), can affect the occurrence of infection. It is actual that the students might finally get infected in a classroom, in a bus, in a restaurant, or somewhere else. However, if a student was frequently exposed to the same virus in several indoor settings right before getting infected, it was impossible to figure out the exact location for the student to get infected. Specifically, in this study, we ignored the potential for infection transmission in other public indoor spaces, such as classrooms, restaurant, buses, etc., when comparing ARI risk in the two buildings, and investigating ventilation impact on ARI risk, for the following reasons:(1)ARI rate was very low in the HVB. This result also implied a low infection risk in other indoor settings because the HVB residents experienced the same public indoor spaces as the LVB residents.(2)The students might meet in other public indoor spaces as listed above, but only the dormitory buildings presented the students completely different ventilation conditions. In other words, among the daily experienced public indoor spaces, only the dormitory buildings provided their residents unique ventilation conditions significantly different to each other.(3)The students frequently switched their locations they were not in the dormitory buildings. Compared to other public indoor spaces, dormitory building provided the students much longer and more stable exposure to infectious viruses.(4)According to the survey data, the students reported illness at some point spent more time in the dormitory buildings than those who did not. This could potentially cause infection risk increased in the dormitory buildings, and reduced in other public indoor spaces.\n",

Therefore, opening windows is an effective measure to improve room ventilation in the LVB. Unfortunately, opening windows is not a viable option most of time during the flu season due to thermal comfort issue that cold outdoor air could create in these rooms. On the other side, for a building with a central air-conditioning system for temperature control, such low infiltration results from intensive high insulation designed to achieve energy savings. From the same perspective, simply opening windows is not a good option for the buildings like the LVB in the flu season.",

Both ventilation and ARI rates were found to be worst in quadruple rooms although these rooms have the largest floor areas and room volumes. These rooms had a decreased ACH with the increase in room volume, because the outside airflow rate primarily depended on the window and wall crack sizes. The reduction in individual ventilation rate along with the increase in room occupancy was most evident in quadruple rooms. Triple rooms had individual ventilation rate comparable to those in double rooms. This may have been related to having window and wall surfaces located at the windward side of the LVB building, and accounted for the trend toward lower ARI attack rates in the triples. Accordingly, locating triple and quadruple rooms at the windward side of LVB-like buildings could improve ventilation within the constraints of the building\u2019s capacity.",

            "text": "The study has several limitations with respect to establishing a quantitative relationship between the ventilation rate and ARI incidence, even though a strong trend was observed. These limitations include inherent sample biases in prediction of ventilation rate and observation of ARI incidence. In terms of prediction of ventilation rate, the timing of door/window opening is important. However, this study did not have sufficient data from a sufficiently wide selection of rooms to approximate ventilation on a typical schedule of student door/window opening habits for all of the rooms. Moreover, the questionnaire about door/window opening was only administered to cases on the day and the days following ARI diagnosis and to contacts of cases on up to seven consecutive days of follow-up. Therefore, with the available survey data, it is not possible to predict an average student schedule of opening windows throughout the flu season. It would be possible to predict these schedules from CO2 sensors, but these two buildings were only partially instrumented. Sensor maintenance took place only once or twice during the flu season due to limited room access required by campus residential policies and regulations. As a result, the room coverage rate with CO2 sensors was 32% in HVB, and 24% in LVB; there rooms were used as representative samples for these two buildings. The model prediction can be further improved by collecting additional CO2 data in the dormitory rooms. Alternatively, the administration of the door/window opening questionnaire to cases and contacts ensured data collection on these critical factors focused on the most critical exposure events, allowing the highest confidence for estimating room-to-room airflow pattern during the relevant time windows. In the future, to remedy the limitation of survey investigation regarding subject and time period selections, we will consider to use motion sensors to record the operation of doors and windows. Such technology can be expected to provide accurate and detailed schedules for door and window opening for all of the rooms of interest during the experimental period.",

The paucity of person-time contributed by HVB occupants resulted in wide confidence limits and a lack of statistical significance even though the incidence rate ratio was large. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the few participants in the HVB were less likely to report symptoms and volunteer for testing than the participants in the LVB where overall participation rate was higher. We note that the HVB residents were students with expressed interest in engineering programs while the LVB residents were students with expressed interest in life sciences and public health. Whether these typical interests are associated with propensity to participate in the study and report illness is unclear. However, these considerations point to a potential for a bias toward overestimating the impact of ventilation and a need to identify methods to increase participation among HVB occupants. Randomization of building assignment so that life science and public health students are not assigned to the LVB every year has not been deemed feasible.",

Transmission at a distance to occupants of neighboring rooms where there is an identifiable aerobiologic pathway (as seen here), when the neighbors are not close social contacts (in contrast to the cases described here) would provide the strongest evidence that a ventilation effect on transmission risk was due to reduced risk of airborne transmission. Alternatively, low ventilation could, in addition to being associated with non-specific building related symptoms, cause increased rates of ARI through a causal impact on host susceptibility to infection. The capability demonstrated here to identify and quantify aerobiologic pathways between rooms will be critical to unravelling these competing, and potentially co-existing effects of ventilation on building occupant health.",

According to the results, CO2 average concentration was 1230 \u00b1 408 ppm in the HVB and 1492 \u00b1 837 ppm in the LVB. Both room and individual ventilation rates in HVB were three times the amount of ventilation in LVB. This difference between ventilation rates in the two dormitory buildings might be overestimated, because the simulations applied closed airflow paths throughout the whole studied period.

Thus, alternative measures, such as careful placement of triple and quadruple dormitory rooms and possibly dividing some quads could be explored for impact on ventilation. Importantly, a case study on the cross-contamination of influenza A virus shows that airborne transmission needs to be analyzed based on the detailed airflow map, rather than the spatial relationship between the rooms. Overall, occupants in poorly ventilated buildings, such as the LVB, may have to play an active role in ensuring adequate ventilation and reducing their risk of suffering from ARIs.",
