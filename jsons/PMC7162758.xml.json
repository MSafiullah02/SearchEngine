Fear responses in both the uninfected and infected may reach psychopathological levels that require psychiatric interventions (Duan and Zhu, 2020), and physicians and mental health professionals may have particularly high need for psychological support in the case of development of stress-related disorders (Chen et al., 2020). An area of key concern is the potential of the psychological context of the pandemic to exacerbate existing psychiatric conditions and influence the manifestation of their symptomatology. Here we report the case of a patient with schizophrenia presenting with COVD-19-related delusions and hallucinations, illustrating the potential of COVID-19 to precipitate entry into a psychotic phase and impact symptom manifestation.",

The patient also reported that he no longer believed that his family and neighbours were infected, and this resulted in reductions of his anxiety and tension. The successful treatment of the COVID-19-related hallucinations leads us to speculate that a decline in paliperidone serum level towards the end of the three months treatment period may have contributed to the onset of the described symptoms.",

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a COVID-19-related paranoid processing in a psychosis patient. It is reasonable to expect that media coverage of exceptional circumstances will influence the content of delusional thoughts, especially in crises like infectious disease pandemics or after assassinations. However, the number of studies addressing such issues is very limited; one such study carried out during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic indicated that patients with schizophrenia and a high level of predicted fear tended to judge their own risk of infection as higher (Maguire et al., 2019a). An interesting aspect of the current case is that in a highly interconnected world, our patient assumed a Chinese WhatsApp message had infected him. Moreover, he was more concerned about others than himself, a manifestation possibly influenced by his former role as an ambulanceman. This observation may be in line with the previous reports that higher levels of concurrent anxiety in patients with schizophrenia correlated with lower perception of personal risk of infection with swine flu, although the reason for this effect is unclear (Maguire et al., 2019a). Patients with schizophrenia have also been shown to be less willing to get vaccinated and to adhere to social distancing during an influenza pandemic (Maguire et al., 2019b). Our patient reported trying to spend more time at home because of COVID-19, but did not adopt other protective measures such as hand washing or wearing a face mask.",
