            "text": "Severe influenza is usually associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia [1\u20134]. Based on the theoretical benefit in modulating hypercytokinemia and the clinical benefits shown in septic shock, corticosteroids have sometimes been used in severe influenza and influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5, 6]. An European retrospective analysis of 208 patients with ARDS related to 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), with 39.9% of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment, refuted the beneficial effects of corticosteroids for patients with influenza-associated ARDS and even showed an increased mortality associated with early corticosteroid treatment (within 3 days of mechanical ventilation) [7]. Another study of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)-related critical illness in Canada, with 46.1% of patients received corticosteroids, also revealed higher hospital mortality, ventilator days, and intensive care unit (ICU) days in patients using corticosteroids, while the odds ratio of association between corticosteroid treatment and hospital mortality decreased from 1.85 in the multivariable model to 0.96 after adjusting for time-dependent between-group differences using marginal structural modeling [8]. A Chinese study of avian influenza A (H7N9) viral pneumonia revealed a significantly higher 60-day mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids, and high-dose corticosteroid treatment was significantly associated with higher 30-day and 60-day mortalities [9]. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 9 cohort studies and 14 case\u2013control studies also showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with higher mortality in patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection [10]. The secondary analysis of a Spanish multicenter prospective cohort study showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with increased ICU mortality in patients with severe influenza [11]. Because corticosteroids might be more frequently and/or earlier used in sicker patients, a solid conclusion about the association between corticosteroid treatments and mortality in severe influenza could not be made.",

Earlier studies using high-dose corticosteroids showed no survival benefit, whereas using low-dose corticosteroids appeared to improve survival [14]. The timing also matters, while starting methylprednisolone more than 14 days after ARDS onset significantly increased mortality [15]. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 cohort studies revealed heterogeneity in effects of corticosteroids on ARDS, which might be influenced by the duration of outcome measures and the etiologies of ARDS [5]. This meta-analysis showed that corticosteroid treatment was not associated with better long-term outcomes in ARDS, and moreover, was associated with increased risk of mortality in influenza-related ARDS [5].",

A multicenter RCT showed that low-dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the mortality in patients with septic shock [27]. Another multicenter RCT of septic shock patients showed that hydrocortisone treatment hastened the reversal of shock, but did not improve survival [28]. Two large RCTs, APROCCHSS and ADRENAL, both showed the effect of corticosteroid treatment in enhancing shock reversal and decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with septic shock [29, 30]. APROCCHSS showed that hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone treatment decreased the 90-day mortality, whereas ADRENAL showed no significant difference in 90-day mortality in patients receiving hydrocortisone or those receiving placebo [29, 30]. Our study showed that shock (vasopressor infusion) was associated with significantly increased hospital mortality. However, the need of vasopressor infusion was excluded during stepwise variable selection for composing the multivariable model, suggesting that corticosteroid treatment might be a greater predictor for hospital mortality. In addition, the results of subgroup analysis showed that early corticosteroid was associated with increased hospital mortality in both vasopressor group and no vasopressor group, suggesting this association was independent of septic shock.",

Designing and conducting an RCT for pandemic critical illness is never easy [31]. To the best of our knowledge, no RCT discussing the role of corticosteroid treatment in influenza-associated ARDS has been done, and our study is one of the largest cohort studies focusing on this topic to date. Secondly, we only included patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for influenza-associated ARDS. In contrast to the previous studies, which included either patients with milder influenza or patients with ARDS from various etiologies, our homogenous cohort provided us a better opportunity for investigating the effect of corticosteroid treatment in the patients with influenza-associated ARDS [1, 2, 5, 9\u201311]. Thirdly, we performed thorough analyses, using variable timing and dosing definitions for corticosteroid treatment. These analyses not only showed consistent results, but also showed the dose-dependent and timing-related effects of corticosteroid treatment.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, our study still has limitations. Firstly, the retrospective nature of our study resulted in few missing values despite the effort in data collection, and might also bring some bias, such as confounding by indications of corticosteroid treatment (i.e., corticosteroid treatment might be used more frequently and earlier in sicker patients). A hard outcome of hospital mortality was therefore adopted. In a Canadian study of influenza-associated critical illness, the use of corticosteroid treatment was mainly associated with hemodynamic instability and chronic airway disease [32]. The subgroup analyses, classifying patients by vasopressor infusion or chronic airway disease, showed consistent results in our study. We also performed multivariable analyses to adjust all possible confounders. To account for residual confounding by indication, we performed another set of analyses in a propensity score-matched sub-cohort, with increased comparability between groups, and found consistent results. Nevertheless, despite efforts to mitigate the effects of residual confounding factors, this potential problem could not be totally solved. The results of this study must therefore be interpreted with caution. Further RCTs or well-designed prospective studies are warranted to understand the benefits or harms associated with corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza-associated ARDS. Secondly, the effects of different types of corticosteroids were not investigated in the current study because some patients used more than one type of corticosteroid and our study had insufficient power to investigate this aspect. To investigate the effect of corticosteroids, we transfer all corticosteroids into hydrocortisone equivalent dose. Although we believe our finding is a class effect of corticosteroids, the differences between various corticosteroids need to be investigated in a larger study in the future.",
