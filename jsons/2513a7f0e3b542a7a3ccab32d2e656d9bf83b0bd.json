In Louisiana, 56.25% of COVIDrelated deaths were among Blacks, even though only 32.7% of the population is black.

Social and structural differences in our communities and society make it easier for some to stay healthy and harder for others 5 . Policies, systems, and environments all combine to limit opportunities for health equality. Low education levels, poverty, food insecurity, low-quality housing, limited transportation options, the threat of crime, and a host of other \"social determinants\" all contribute to health disparities. Such unfavorable conditions are especially prevalent among many majority African American communities.",

However, anecdotal evidence suggests that these sites are not accessible by many members of traditionally underserved communities, due to lack of a physician referral, lack of reliable transportation, or lack of communication options such as a mobile phone to communicate with testing personnel while in line. We must address these issues to ensure that testing is available and accessible to those who seem to be at highest risk of ending up hospitalized and needing intensive care.",

In addition, implementation of \"navigator\" programs at these sites would allow those without transportation or mobile phones to work directly with a properly protected, trained lay-person to determine whether a test is needed and, if so, to schedule one. Navigators can also help patients receive and interpret results through a communication channel that works for the patient.",

It is vital that we ensure that people do not yet again \"fall through the cracks\" -get tested, but receive no care or get care, but then receive no follow up.
