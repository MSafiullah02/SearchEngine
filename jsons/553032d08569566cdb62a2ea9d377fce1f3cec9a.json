The recombinantly expressed rabies virus phosphoprotein (RV-P) and the anti-staphylococcal protein A (anti-SPA) polyclonal antibody were coated on the test (T) and control (C) lines on a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. This layout is designed such that the polyclonal antibody in canine serum is captured by the colloidal gold-SPA conjugates, before the rabies antibody complex is specifically selected by the RV-P deposited on the T line, forming a 'sandwich' pattern. Unbound excess colloidal SPA then proceeds to the control line where SPA specifically interacts with the anti-SPA antibody, producing a red precipitation at the C line, indicating the validity of the strip. We tested 165 canine serum samples with the strips, and the results were compared with those obtained using ELISA.

Rabies detection has been extensively studied for decades. The fluorescent antibody test (FAT) was first applied as a technical recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1950s and is still widely used for the detection of the rabies virus antigen in the cerebral tissue of infected animals (Whitfield et al. 2001; Wunner and Briggs 2010) . FAT, together with the rapid tissue culture infection test (RTCIT) and the mouse inoculation test (MIT), serves as the golden standard for rabies detection.
