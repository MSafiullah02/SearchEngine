            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), characterized by pulmonary inflammation and respiratory failure, is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) variant, SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). SARS-CoV is highly transmissible in humans with a fatality rate near 10% (Donnelly et al., 2004, Riley et al., 2003). Once infected with SARS-CoV, the typical pathology is severe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in patients' lungs, which leads to the failure of lung function (Hamming et al., 2004, Mossel et al., 2005, Nicholls et al., 2003, Tse et al., 2004). Soon after SARS-CoV was isolated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the primary receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). A recent study of the ACE2 crystal structure revealed that several amino acid residues are very important for binding to the Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005b, Li et al., 2006). Interestingly, individual or an E145/N147/D157 triple mutant in hu-ACE2 had a profound effect on viral entry, which suggested a critical role for ACE2 in SARS-CoV pathogenesis (Han et al., 2006, Hofmann et al., 2006, Li et al., 2005c).",

A recent study indicates that ACE2 knockout mice exhibit severe pathology with endotoxin-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as compared to ACE2 naive mice (Imai et al., 2005). The loss of ACE2 expression in knockout mice results in enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, neutrophil accumulation and weakened lung function. These results indicate that ACE2 plays a protective role in ARDS-related lung damage. Although two studies showed that ACE2 gene polymorphisms do not seem to affect the outcome of SARS in humans (Chiu et al., 2004, Itoyama et al., 2005), a recent small animal study suggests that the down-regulation of ACE2 could contribute to lung damage in a SARS-CoV challenge model (Kuba et al., 2005). Up to now, however, it is still unclear whether a similar mechanism applies to SARS in humans.",

This model was initially established to investigate the causative agent of SARS and has since played an essential role for testing new strategies for therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV infection (Chen et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005a, Qin et al., 2005). During these studies, however, we found that Chinese macaques often recover from the viral infection spontaneously and, therefore, never died of SARS. Moreover, the severity of lung damage varies significantly in infected Chinese rhesus monkeys as determined by pathological analysis. Some monkeys developed severe lung damage with DAD while others only had mild interstitial pneumonia. These findings prompted us to examine whether rh-ACE2 could play a role in early lung pathogenesis in these animals.",

Two uninfected monkeys (Rh13 and Rh14) were included as controls. Although infected macaques did not have significant clinical signs other than fever and loss of appetite, it was crucial to determine whether they had developed any pathological changes in their respiratory system. For this reason, necropsy specimens collected from the sacrificed macaques were evaluated for pathological abnormalities on day 7 post infection. We chose day 7 for sampling because obvious pathological changes were often found in most infected animals at this time point (Chen et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005a, Qin et al., 2005). In general, the major histopathological changes were primarily found in the lung of infected macaques (Figs. 1B, C, E and F). The infected animals had acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. It was common to see multifocal pulmonary consolidations characterized by broadened alveolar septa, poorly preserved alveolar lining, epithelial hyperplasia, capillary vessel dilation and congestion, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. According to the severity of the pathologic changes, six monkeys (Rh1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12) were classified in the \u201cmild\u201d group (Figs. 1B and E) with another five animals (Rh2, 3, 4, 8 and 11) in the \u201csevere\u201d group (Figs. 1C and F). Animals in the latter group developed acute DAD with extensively broadened alveolar septa, increased monocyte infiltration, visible exudation of protein-rich edema fluid in alveolar cavities, ruptured elastic fiber of alveolus, and local fusion of thick septa (Figs. 1C and F). In contrast, uninfected animals did not display signs of lung damage (Figs. 1A and D). SARS-CoV specific antigens were detected in both groups of infected animals (Figs. 1E and F).",

Sequence analysis shows that hu-ACE2 genes are less diverse with an average intraspecies genetic homology of 99.9%, which contrasts the 99.1% found in Chinese monkeys (Table 2). Pairwise comparison indicates that the average ds/dn of rh-ACE2 (3.6689) is significantly smaller than that of hu-ACE2 (10.4417) (Table 2). Multiple ACE2 clones from each animal were sequenced with consistent variations obtained. Interestingly, none of these sporadic NS mutations make critical interactions with the RBD (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).

By analyzing the profiles of all rh-ACE2 clones in mediating viral entry, we found that there were two dominant amino acid differences between clones 11-1 and 11-7, R192G and Y217N (Fig. 5A), which might contribute to the unique phenotype of 11-7. For this reason, individual amino acid substitutions (G192R and N217Y) were introduced into clone 11-7. Interestingly, no significant difference was found in ACE2 expression between 11-7 and 11-7(G192R) using western blot and immunofluorescence assays (Figs. 5B and D). The 11-7(N217Y) mutation, however, was able to restore the expression of 11-7 approaching the level of 11-1 (Fig. 5B). This increase is highly significant (t test, p\n < 0.01). Accordingly, 11-7(N217Y) also supported viral entry efficiently (Fig. 5C).

These substitutions, however, are not involved in viral interaction and, therefore, do not affect the function of rh-ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein dependent viral entry. We, however, show that some sporadic natural non-synonymous mutations are likely critical for rh-ACE2 expression, which, in turn, affects viral infection significantly. In particular, a single amino acid substitution Y217N almost abolishes rh-ACE2 expression and viral entry. This substitution also has a similar effect on the function of hu-ACE2. These results indicate that the natural mutation Y217N in rh-ACE2 probably play a role in modulating the SARS-CoV infection.

The predominant pattern of lung injury in most acute human cases that end in fatality includes severe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin (Franks et al., 2003). Moreover, some cases also exhibit organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia (Nicholls et al., 2003, Shieh et al., 2005). In previous studies, it has been reported that various species of rhesus macaques can be infected by SARS-CoV (Osterhaus et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2005, Rowe et al., 2004). The infected animals, however, often recovered from viral infection spontaneously and, therefore, never died of SARS. The underlying mechanism which contributes to the disease progression remains unknown in macaques. In this study, we show that eleven macaques were successfully infected with SARS-CoVPUMC01, determined mainly by lung pathology, RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining assays. The challenged macaques were sacrificed on day seven post infection so that the acute lung damages were captured for analysis. Consistent with previous findings in simian models, SARS-CoV infection indeed caused DAD, broadening alveolar septa with increased monocyte infiltration, visible exudation in alveolar cavities, ruptured elastic alveolar fibers, and local fusion of thick septa in Chinese macaques (Figs. 1C and F) (Li et al., 2005a, Qin et al., 2005). However, only a portion of infected animals developed \u201csevere\u201d lung damage with DAD while others only had \u201cmild\u201d interstitial pneumonia based on pathological evaluations (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

            "text": "The viral entry efficiency mediated by rh-ACE2 is unlikely associated with the severity of lung damage in infected Chinese rhesus monkeys. We determine whether the variation of rh-ACE2 plays a role in SARS lung pathogenesis because ACE2 is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV entry into target cells. A recent study indicated that ACE2 was detected in ciliated epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal or tracheobronchial regions. It was evident that SARS-CoV may infect the proximal airways and cause highly cytolytic effects because infected ciliated cells were necrotic and shed over time onto the luminal surface of the airway (Sims et al., 2005). Since the ciliated epithelial cells of monkey airway tissues are less susceptible to infection (Sims et al., 2005), it is possible that rh-ACE2 or its variant does not function as an effective receptor for SARS-CoV, which, in turn, leads to a mild disease outcome (Rowe et al., 2004). We, however, found that most rh-ACE2 genes supports viral entry effectively even if they contain 38 or more NS differences when compared with human counterparts (except for clone 11-7) (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4B). Based on the sequence of Rh8, which harbors consensus NS differences (Fig. 3), rh-ACE2 supported viral entry with slightly better efficiency than the human homologue (Fig. 4E). We therefore believe that, in general, rh-ACE2 itself is not likely acting as a major restriction factor for the self-limiting infection of SARS-CoV in macaques. To this end, other factors involved in lung pathology should be further studied in the model system because previous studies have demonstrated that multiple factors could have contributed to the lung damage of infected SARS patients. These factors include the involvement of other host proteins (e.g. L-SIGN), activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improper treatment, and manifestations in multiple organs (Chan et al., 2006, Ding et al., 2004, He et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2006, Law et al., 2005, Peiris et al., 2004, To et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The natural variation of rh-ACE2 genes is relatively diverse among Chinese rhesus monkeys. When compared with seven hu-ACE2 genes deposited in GenBank (Table 2), it is interesting that the sequence homology among rh-ACE2 genes is smaller than that of hu-ACE2. In particular, except for Rh8 and Rh10, most animals harbor heterozygous ACE2 genes with distinct NS substitutions (Table 1; Fig. 3). Moreover, rh-ACE2 has a significantly smaller ds/dn ratio than hu-ACE2 (Table 2). This is unusual compared to monkey chemokine receptor CCR5 and CXCR4, which are often homozygous genes except for the heterozygous variants found in some mangabey species (Chen et al., 1997, Chen et al., 1998a, Chen et al., 1998b). The underlying mechanism driving rh-ACE2 evolution is, therefore, an interesting area for further investigation. We report here a Chinese rhesus monkey that harbors an rh-ACE2 mutant (Rh11-7) which neither expresses well nor supports viral entry efficiently. Since this case was both found among the \u201csevere\u201d groups, it raises one potential hypothesis that this variant might arise due to SARS-CoV infection, and the reduced ACE2 expression, in turn, contributes to severe lung damage (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of ACE2 expression has previously been identified as a causative agent for lung damage in a small animal study, lending further support to this hypothesis (Imai et al., 2005). We found that infected macaques with severe lung damage had significantly lower levels of ACE2 mRNA when compared to the mild group of animals (Fig. 4D). This finding is probably due to the overall damage of lung tissues, which resulted in the significant loss of ACE2 expressing pneumocytes (Figs. 1C and F), rather than to the emergence of Rh11-7 mutant. Detailed studies may require in vivo monitoring of rh-ACE2 mRNA levels and protein expression in the lung of infected monkeys over the course of infection, which is technically difficult. Since most NS variations seem to be sporadic (Fig. 3), there is probably not a common mechanism for knock down of rh-ACE2 expression in these animals.",

            "text": "A single, natural mutation in rh-ACE2 gene can determine the entry efficiency of SARS-CoV. A recent structural analysis of hu-ACE2 has identified the key residues that make direct contact with the RBD including Q24, T27, K31, H34, E37, D38, Y41, Q42, L45, L79, M82, Y83, N90, Q325, E329, N330, K353 and G354 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, these sites are located in three discontinuous regions (i) residues K31 and Y41 on \u03b1-helix 1; (ii) M82, Y83 and P84 on loop 2; and (iii) K353, D355 and R357 on \u03b2-sheet 5 (Li et al., 2005b, Li et al., 2005c). Mutagenesis studies further indicate that individual substitution of these sites or a triple mutant E145/N147/D157A significantly reduces viral infection (Han et al., 2006, Hofmann et al., 2006, Li et al., 2005c). In this study, since residue Y217 is unlikely to make direct contact with RBD, it must employ a different mechanism for reducing viral entry. In this case, the loss of infection is likely due to the loss of rh-ACE2 expression rather a block of viral interaction (Figs. 4A and B). Since the introduction of Y217N also has a profound effect on hu-ACE2 (Figs. 6A and B), the function of the mutation is unlikely to be a species-specific phenomenon. We, therefore, believe that we have identified a natural mutation, which is likely critical for a functional domain in regulating the gene expression of both rh-ACE2 and hu-ACE2. Our results also indicate that natural mutations in rh-ACE2 probably play a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection efficiency. However, how exactly the Y217N mutation leads to the reduced expression of both rh-ACE2 and hu-ACE2 will require further investigation.",
