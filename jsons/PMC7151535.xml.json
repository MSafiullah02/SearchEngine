Previous epidemics or pandemics of coronaviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The most recent pandemic of coronavirus infection is coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV2 [1,2]. The symptoms of COVID-19 infection usually appear after an incubation period of about five days. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 illness are fever, cough, and fatigue; other symptoms include headache, hemoptysis, and dyspnea, among others. In the most severe cases, patients may develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac problems, and multiorgan failure [1]. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019 [1]; however, when we searched the MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed), from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020, with the key word \u201cCOVID 19\u201d, surprisingly 1655 articles were yielded. This shows that COVID-19 pandemic is of great global public health concern.",

Table 3\nshows the summary of these studies on the CNS manifestations of COVID-19. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients [9]. However, the authors did not perform electroencephalography (EEG) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Another retrospective study investigated acute cerebrovascular disease occurrence following COVID-19 [10]. Other studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general; they did not specifically pay attention to the neurological manifestations [[11], [12], [13], [14]].",

Some patients with COVID-19 may show nonspecific neurological symptoms, such as confusion and headache. A few patients with COVID-19 showed more specific neurological manifestations, such as seizure or cerebrovascular problems (Table 3).

Human coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract; they can invade the CNS. A growing body of evidence shows that neuroinvasion and neurotropism is a common feature of human coronaviruses [2]. Infection with SARS-CoV has been associated with neurological manifestations. In the reported patients with SARS-CoV, CSF tested positive for the virus [15,16]. In one study of 183 hospitalized children with clinically suspected acute encephalitis, 22 (12%) had coronavirus infection (type was not specified) by detection of anti-CoV IgM [17]. In a study of 70 patients with MERS-CoV infection, altered mental status was reported in 26% of the patients and 9% of the people had seizure [18]. Therefore, it is very likely to observe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 if we carefully and specifically look for them.",

Hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures and status epilepticus to happen in these patients. Impaired mental status has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19 [9, 14]; but, this manifestation has never been studied appropriately in previous studies (Table 3). When visiting a patient who is in a critical medical condition and has a change in mental status, one should make sure that nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is not a part of the clinical scenario. The diagnosis of NCSE is frequently overlooked, with patients in critical medical conditions having other serious problems. It is necessary to perform continuous EEG monitoring in any patient with a critical medical condition, who has a change in mental status, in order to make a timely diagnosis of NCSE [19]. Salzburg Consensus Criteria for Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus is a helpful guide to make a diagnosis of NCSE in critically ill patients [20].",
