The majority of study patients had serological evidence of SARS-CoV infection as determined by an in-house indirect immunofluoresence assay (Chan P K et al., 2004a) and of the few patients that died before a convalescent serum sample could be collected, SARS-CoV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or virus isolation (Chan P K et al., 2004b) .

While this does not preclude such an association, the present data are fully consistent with the current view that susceptibility and outcome post infection with the SARS-CoV are more likely to be influenced by the innate inflammatory response and factors such as age and associated underlying illness (Peiris J S M et al., 2004) than the specific arm of the immune response. Issues of small sample numbers have the ability to bias interpretations and this has been noted by others (http:// (Ceppellini R et al., 1955) was used to calculate GF.

While on-going studies to further understand the molecular details of the inflammatory and immune response to infection with the SARS-CoV are essential, it is important to remember and reinforce the public health message that the most effective tool in the fight against SARS is the same as that used against an age old infection like cholera, namely rapid tracing, identification and isolation of infected individuals and their contacts in order to limit the spread of the infectious agent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 329, "text": "(Xiong P et al., 2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 634, "end": 661, "text": "(Peiris J S M et al., 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 850, "text": "(Ceppellini R et al., 1955)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Editor,"}, {"text": "The authors thank Prof. Paul Chan, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong for the provision of patient samples used in this study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FOOTNOOTES"}, {"text": "All the authors declare that they have no competing interest.
