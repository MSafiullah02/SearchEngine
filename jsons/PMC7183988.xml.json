The patients COVID-19 positive are the main source of infection, the asymptomatics are extremely contagious, with a strong infectivity in the incubation period ranging from 1 to 14 days. The person-to- person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. The fecal-oral route remains to be determined. Infection control measures are necessary to prevent the virus from further spreading and to help control the epidemic situation.1 The risk of infection during the diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases was also quickly assessed, suspending non-urgent outpatient oral treatments and maintaining the main emergencies of the oro-maxillofacial district represented by trauma, malignant neoplasms and infections which require timely treatment.",

This situation made it necessary not only the application of measures to limit the spread of the infection, but also the identification of health facilities capable of managing patients infected by COVID-19. In the Calabria Region, Catanzaro UNICZ Hospital represents the only centre that has an intensive care unit with the possibility to treat patients with severe forms of infection that require extracorporeal oxygenation technique (ECMO) and with high specialization in the management of severe forms of ARDS. A clinical management protocol for both suspected and confirmed cases has been adopted, in order to support centres that require to centralize at our COVID-19 Centre the patients affected by related ARDS COVID-19 forms. This protocol was scrupulously followed also in the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway of patients affected by traumatic and oncological pathology at the Maxillofacial Unit Surgery of \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d University of Catanzaro, which also represents the only public reference centre for the Calabria Region.3 The surgical pathology of the oro-maxillofacial district is highly specific and the maxillofacial surgeon can be exposed to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria that infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. Maxillofacial care settings invariably carry the risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the specificity of its procedures, which involves face-to-face communication with patients, and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids (if during the clinical examination the patient coughs the smallest droplets of saliva float in the air for a long time, also some strains of viruses have been detected in the saliva for up to 29 days after the infection).",

The surgical therapeutic protocol adopted for oncological patients was that reported in the literature and specific to the site of injury. To reduce surgical time and hospital stay, patients underwent tumorectomy and reconstruction with local/regional flaps. During the operation we used scalpel over monopolar cautery for mucosal or skin incision and bipolar cautery on lower power setting for hemostasis. For malignant neoplasms in a more advanced state, neo-adjuvant therapy to control the development of the disease may be indicated. For non-critical cancer patients, elective surgery should be postponed, provided that this choice does not negatively affect the prognosis. Because of these patients are often candidates for radiotherapy which must be performed 4-6 weeks after surgery, it is recommended hygiene and disinfection to limit the spread of the infection.",
