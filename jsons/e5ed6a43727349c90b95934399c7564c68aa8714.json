            "text": "Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) have been widely used in many fields because they are affordable and portable. For reproducible quantitative analysis, it is crucial to strongly immobilize proteins on PADs. Conventional techniques for immobilizing proteins on PADs are based on physical adsorption, but proteins can be easily removed by weak physical forces. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure the reproducibility of the analytical results of PADs using physical adsorption. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we showed a method of covalent binding of proteins to cellulose paper. This method consists of three steps, which include periodate oxidation of paper, the formation of a Schiff base, and reductive amination. We identified aldehyde and imine groups formed on paper using FT-IR analysis. This covalent bonding approach enhanced the binding force and binding capacity of proteins. We confirmed the activity of an immobilized antibody through a sandwich immunoassay. We expect that this immobilization method will contribute to the commercialization of PADs with high reproducibility and sensitivity.",

            "text": "In recent years, easy-to-use and low-cost diagnostic devices have been developed for applications in the developing world [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] this is because clinical diagnosis is the most important step in the treatment of disease. Current clinical diagnoses that are available in the developed world require expensive reagents and sophisticated equipment. Therefore, in the developing world, where access to clinical diagnosis is limited, patients can suffer because of the cost of personal diagnosis [8] . Therefore, to overcome this problem, it is very important to develop a point-of-care (POC) device. A POC device can provide accurate and rapid results for diagnosis at a site of patient care. Ideal POC devices are required to be \"ASSURED\", a criteria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [9, 10] . \"ASSURED\" devices must be affordable, sensitive, specific, user friendly, rapid and robust, equipment free, and deliverable, as outlined by the WHO criteria. These criteria are an essential guideline for future diagnostic devices. To achieve these criteria, especially affordability, it is crucial to select inexpensive materials for the fabrication of PADs.",

Paper facilitates the immobilization of detection materials and the diffusion of the analyte because the paper has a porous structure [15] . Additionally, paper can be easily patterned by conventional photolithography processes [16] , inkjet printing [17] , wax printing [18] , or screen printing methods [19] for mass production. Moreover, paper is abundant and affordable. Due to the properties of paper, paper-based analytical devices (PAD) have many advantages. The advantages of PADs are simple fabrication, low sample and reagent consumption, rapid analysis, simple operation, disposability, and portability [10, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Because of these characteristics, PADs are currently used in a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring [12, 24, 25] , medical diagnosis [2, 10, 12, 26] , and food safety monitoring [10, 12] .",

To date, conventional techniques for biomolecule immobilization on paper-based sensors are based on physical adsorption [21] . However, biomolecules are physically bound to paper fibers. Physically adsorbed biomolecules can be easily removed due to weak physical forces, such as electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions between biomolecules and paper. Therefore, the physical adsorption of biomolecules cannot always assure reproducible results [27] . Wei Shen's group has shown that approximately 40% of antibodies adsorbed on paper can be desorbed from the paper substrate by washing [28] . For more sensitive and quantitative bioanalysis, it is crucial to immobilize biomolecules on paper-based sensors using immobilization via covalent bonds. To overcome this problem, we present a method of covalent binding of proteins to paper for a paper-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect MERS-CoV. ",

Subsequently, the printed paper was heated at 160\u00b0C for 8 sec using a laminator (PhotoLami-350R6, Hyundai Office Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea) and then naturally cooled at room temperature. A laminator is able to control the rate of lamination by the rotation rate of rollers [29] . Consequently, wax can melt and spread on the paper to form a hydrophobic wax barrier on the paper. These wax patterning fabrication processes can be completed within 5 min.",

It is crucial to strongly immobilize analyte proteins on the biosensor for quantification assays that are reproducible and sensitive. Conventional techniques for immobilizing proteins on paper-based sensors are based on physical adsorption. Therefore, to compare covalent binding with physical adsorption, we immobilized FITC-BSA on paper using the covalent binding method with periodate oxidation (a in Fig. 4A ) and physical adsorption without periodate oxidation (b in Fig. 4A ). FITC-BSA was immobilized at various concentrations (1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL). After 10 washes with FITC-BSA-immobilized paper, the fluorescence intensity was compared. The values on the graph are represented by the signal-to-noise ratio, and the larger the signal-to-noise ratio is, the greater the signal size relative to the background noise. Fig. 4A shows a clear enhancement in fluorescence intensity, indicating efficient immobilization of FITC-BSA on the periodate-oxidized paper. Each image is a fluorescence image of paper areas washed 10 times after protein immobilization. Fig. 4Aa is the fluorescence image obtained by covalent binding of FITC-BSA to paper using periodate oxidation. Fig. 4Ab shows the fluorescence image obtained by physically adsorbing FITC-BSA without periodate oxidation. The fluorescence intensity of paper using the covalent binding method was significantly greater than the fluorescence intensity of paper using the physical adsorption method, even though the same concentration of FITC-BSA was immobilized. To analyze and compare fluorescence intensity quantitatively, we measured the intensity using ImageJ software (Fig. 4B ). In the case of covalent binding of FITC-BSA, the fluorescence intensity increased linearly with increasing protein concentration. The fluorescence intensity increased when the amount of FTIC-BSA immobilized on the paper increased. This result indicates that the amount of protein immobilized on the paper can be quantified according to the concentration of the protein. However, when FITC-BSA was physically adsorbed, the fluorescence intensity increased slightly when the concentration increased. This indicates that when the fluorescence intensity increased, the amount of FTIC-BSA adsorbed on the paper also increased, but the fluorescence intensity only slightly increased. This is because unbound or physically adsorbed proteins on the paper were easily washed away through several washing processes. Additionally, pure cellulose has a relatively low capacity for protein adsorption compared to that of periodate-oxidized paper.",

This indicates that the protein binding capacity of periodate-oxidized paper was improved compared with that of pure cellulose paper. This result also shows that when FITC-BSA is covalently immobilized on the periodate-oxidized paper, the protein binds more strongly to the paper than through physical adsorption. In addition, the stability of immobilized antibodies on a paper surface has been studied by Fang Zeng's group [39] . Their results showed that fluorescence intensities using covalent binding of antibody molecules on paper were reduced by 25% of the initial values. Compared to the intensities for covalent binding, the fluorescence intensities using physical adsorption of antibody molecules on paper were reduced by 80% of the initial values. This indicates that antibody stability is much greater when using covalent binding of antibodies. Physically adsorbed biomolecules can be easily removed due to the weak physical forces between biomolecules and paper. The instability of adhesion results in the heterogeneity of the amount of adsorbed biomolecules before the assay. Due to the heterogeneity of the amount of adsorbed biomolecules, it is difficult to ensure the reproducibility of analytical results of biosensors using physical adsorption. Thus, covalent binding using periodate-oxidized paper could enhance the binding capacity and binding ability of protein on paper, which could enhance the sensitivity and reproducibility of paper-based analytical devices.",

We used a colorimetric method so that the results of the paper-based sandwich ELISA could be interpreted without plate readers or fluorescence scanners. Fig. 5A shows a schematic diagram of a paper-based sandwich ELISA for the detection of MERS CoV. The MERS-CoV antigen was used as a model analyte. The MERS-CoV capture antibody (D5) and HRP-labeled anti-6X His-tagged antibody were used as primary and secondary antibodies. The MERS-CoV capture antibody was covalently immobilized on the paper through an aldehyde group formed by periodate oxidation. Because the MERS-CoV capture antibody is specific for the MERS-CoV antigen, it interacts with the MERS-CoV antigen to form an antibodyantigen complex. To detect the MERS-CoV antigen attached to the MERS-CoV capture antibody, the HRP-labeled anti-6X His-tagged antibody was added to the paper. The HRPlabeled anti-6X His-tagged antibody recognized the MERS-CoV antigen and formed a sandwich structure. Because of the presence of the Histidine tag in the MERS-CoV antigen, it binds to HRP-labeled anti-6X His-tagged antibodies that recognize histidine. After addition of the TMB substrate, the HRP enzyme in the sandwich structure reacts with TMB substrate to form the color changes from transparent to blue [40] , indicating the presence of the MERS-CoV antigen. Fig. 5B shows an image of paper areas as a result of the sandwich ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV. The paper-based sandwich ELISA produced different color signals for the MERS-CoV antigen with different concentrations. The intensity of the blue color was developed by the HRP-labeled antibody. This intensity was proportional to the number of detected MERS-CoV antigens. This result indicates that as the concentration of the antigen increased, the amount of antigen recognized by the MERS-CoV capture antibody bound to the paper increased. To analyze the color intensity quantitatively, the paper was scanned with a document scanner, and the color intensity of each test area was analyzed using ImageJ software. Concentration versus relative intensity plots of the paper-based sandwich ELISA are shown in Fig. 5C . The standard curve was made by a standard four-parameter logistic regression, and a sigmoidal curve was obtained. The plot obtained from the paper-based sandwich ELISA provides an approximate quantitative estimation of bound MERS-CoV antigen by the color intensity. We determined the limit of detection of the MERS-CoV antigen using a paper-based sandwich ELISA. The limit of detection of the MERS-CoV antigen was approximately 10.4 nM, which is three times the standard deviation of the control.",

We immobilized antibodies on periodate-oxidized paper through Schiff base formation and a reductive amination process. We confirmed that the covalent bonds formed on the paper had high binding forces of the antibody. In addition, we successfully performed a paper-based sandwich ELISA. We showed that paper-based sandwich ELISA can be used to detect and quantify the MERS-CoV antigen using an antibody conjugated to HRP to produce a colorimetric readout. This result indicated that the covalently immobilized antibody retained antibody activity. Based on this result, covalent immobilization of proteins using periodate-oxidized paper could be a promising route for attaching various amine-containing biomolecules, such as bacteria, enzymes, and DNA, on paper surfaces. Thus, we expect that this covalent immobilization method will be useful for paperbased analytical devices (PADs) for quantitative assays with high reproducibility and sensitivity. ",
