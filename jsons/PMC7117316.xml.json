The comparative modeling procedure COMPOSER [11], [12] implemented in SYBYL6.9 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) was used to build a 3D model of the ACE2 structure. We used the tACE and AnCE structures to find out topologically equivalent residues based on structural alignment and the structurally conserved regions (SCRs) were modeled. The structurally variable regions (loops) were modeled by using loops either from the corresponding location of the homologous protein or from the general protein database. The 3D model of ACE2 was then subjected to energy minimization by using standard Tripos force fields and finally validated with the PROCHECK program [13]. The coordinates were deposited to the protein data bank (PDB) (code: 1RIX).",

The sequences of both ACE2 and the S RBD were scanned against the PROSITE [15] motifs in order to locate potential glycosylation sites. Six N-glycosylation sites with high probability of occurrences on ACE2 were predicted by PROSITE. Fully surface-exposed asparagine (N) residues were found at five of these sites, which were modeled by attaching N-acetylglucosamine moieties. Three N-glycosylation sites were found in the S RBD fragment and were modeled similarly. The areas of solvent accessibility (ASA) were calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 \u00c5 by using the Lee and Richards\u2019 algorithm [16]. Electrostatistic potentials were calculated by using the program GRASP [17] with the following parameters: a protein dielectric constant of 2.0, a solvent dielectric constant of 80, an ion exclusion radius of 2.0 \u00c5, a probe radius of 1.4 \u00c5, and an ionic strength of 0.14 M. The calculated potentials were displayed at the solvent-accessible surface. The visualization of solvent accessibility, super-positioning of molecules, and calculation of surface hydrophobicity were performed by using InsightII. The hydrophobicity of the surface residues was calculated according to the Kyte\u2013Doolittle method [18] with a window size of 5, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic levels of 0.7 and \u22122.4, respectively.",

Currently, the only computational methodology that allows prediction of protein 3D structures with high accuracy (an rms error lower than 2 \u00c5) is comparative (homology) modeling. However, it requires sequence identity of the target protein with templates of known 3D structures higher than about 30% for accurate structure prediction. We found two proteins, tACE and AnCE, with available high resolution crystal structures, and ACE2 sequence identities of 43% and 35% (sequence similarities are 61% and 55%), respectively; the sequence alignment of ACE2 with tACE and AnCE2 is shown in Fig. 1\n.

The superposition of the ACE2 model structure with the template structures of tACE and AnCE (Fig. 2B) shows very small deviation (rmsd less than 0.5 \u00c5). A major feature of the ACE2 structure (and the template structures) is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site (Fig. 3A\n). A comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the catalytic site was very recently reported after our model was completed [19]; here we will not discuss the enzymatic function of ACE2 but rather use the enzymatic site location for reference purposes. The channel is surrounded by ridges containing loops, helices, and a portion of a \u03b2-sheet. The long loop between N210 and Q221 that is missing in tACE and AnCE (Fig. 1) is on the ACE2 surface (Fig. 2B); note that the orientation of ACE2 in Fig. 2B is different than in Fig. 2A in order to show this loop. Potential N-glycosylation sites were identified at six positions: 53, 90, 103, 322, 432, and 546, but only two of them (53 and 90) were aligned with the tACE structure (Fig. 1). They shared the pattern NXTX (except 103) and were modeled with a N-acetylglucosamine moiety (Fig. 3B). The direction of the main chain is illustrated in Fig. 3C.",

            "text": "Interactions of viral attachment proteins with protein receptor molecules are mostly determined by complementarity in surface charge distribution, hydrophobic interactions, and geometry; typically carbohydrates are excluded from the binding sites [9]. In an attempt to provide working hypothesis for possible regions involved in the interaction of the S-glycoprotein with its receptor we analyzed the ACE2 surface potential, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and carbohydrate distribution. The surface of the deep channel at the top of ACE2 and the surrounding ridges is highly negatively charged (Fig. 3A). These ridges contain residues D136, E150, N154, D157, D292, D295, and D299 some of which have large ASA values, e.g., D136, N154, and D157 have 109, 108, and 80 \u00c52, respectively (Fig. 4\n). Comparison of these residues with the corresponding residues from ACE that do not support fusion mediated by the S-glycoprotein [2], and mouse ACE2 that binds to S but with somewhat lower affinity than human ACE2 (M. Farzan, personal communication) (Fig. 5\n) supports the possibility that some of these residues contribute to specific binding. The hydrophobicity analysis revealed distinct hydrophobic patches in close proximity to the negatively charged ridges (Fig. 3D). There are at least three hydrophobic regions comprising different residues including Phe, Trp, and Tyr which could contribute to binding in addition to the charged binding surface. All carbohydrate sites are topologically apart from the electronegative surface at the top of the molecule (Fig. 3B).",

The sequence similarity of the attachment glycoprotein (S1) from the SARS-CoV to other coronavirus S1 glycoproteins or other proteins with known 3D structures is even lower. Such low sequence similarity does not allow accurate homology modeling. Due to the absence of significant sequence similarity, we built a model by threading (data not shown) of a fragment (amino acid residues 300\u2013537) containing the S RBD that we have recently identified [3]. The electrostatic analysis of the model revealed mostly positive charges on the surface and, particularly, an electronegative loop containing residues K439, R441, R444, H445, and K447. The hydrophobic analysis suggested several patches of hydrophobic residues around the positively charged loop region. One must note that although the size of the fragment is relatively small, the S RBD modeling has limitations in the absence of a template structure(s) with high sequence identity. Thus, the RBD model could significantly deviate or even be completely different from the real structure. In this aspect modeling of the much larger S1 and S2 units is even less reliable. For example, a recent model [20] of S1 and S2 proposed putative receptor (thought to be CD13) binding regions located in S2 instead of S1 where RBDs of coronaviruses should be. This is why we used our RBD model mostly as an illustration of possible complementary charged surfaces, hydrophobic patches, and \u03b2-sheets, and complemented it with an analysis of the secondary structure of the RBD fragment that also revealed predominance of \u03b2-sheets (data not shown). In progress are our experiments for the SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein RBD crystallization and determination of its 3D structure.",

The model structure of ACE2 indicates that some or most of the ridges surrounding the cavity at the top of the molecule (Fig. 6\n) could serve as a likely binding region for the S-glycoprotein for the following reasons. First, the top of the molecule is far away of the membrane and is likely to be easier to reach than membrane proximal regions. Second, protruding structures are likely to be used for binding by viral proteins; it will also ensure geometric complementarity with concave surfaces as the S RBD domain could be based on our illustrative model (Fig. 6). Third, the negative charges of the ridges complement the positive charges of the RBD. Fourth, the hydrophobic patches around the charges could contribute to binding. Finally, the lack of carbohydrates at the top of the molecule could ensure high-affinity binding. Experiments currently in progress will determine the specific amino acid residues and their relative contribution to the interaction of ACE2 with the S-glycoprotein. The ACE2 model developed here, and this proposition of binding regions could help in the design and analysis of the experimental data, and the virus binding function of ACE2.",
