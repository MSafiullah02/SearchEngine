San Raffaele Hospital is a multi-specialty university center in Milan and one of several institutions caring for COVID-19 patients while still providing emergent cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery services. They have 52 intensive care beds specifically for mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and another 260 beds for symptomatic COVID-19 patients on oxygen therapy. Fifteen beds are designated for cardiovascular care and seven beds are for postoperative intensive care. Nearly all other Italian critical care facilities are allocated for CoVID-19. Professor Alberto Zangrillo, Head of the Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, states \"Every hospital in this country has increased, doubled and, in our case, tripled the number of intensive care beds. The problem is that this virus is extremely contagious and in two or three weeks has brought to our ICUs (intensive care unit) the number of patients we used to see in an entire year.\" \"When these patients develop pneumonia, they have a form of exudative alveolitis that in a very short time makes them very dependent on positive end-expiratory pressure. It is a form of pneumonia that tends to resolve, but requires an ICU stay of more than 2 weeks.\" He recommends early adoption of containment to slow the contagion and an aggressive proactive approach to invasive ventilation. There are several regions where ventilators are in short supply. 6 Although there are enough physicians, there are not enough physicians with appropriate skills.",

Volume assessment should include lung ultrasound. Cardiac involvement is common in patients with advanced disease. It is difficult to determine the exact role of the SARS-CoV-2 cardiac infection because these patients often have multiple acute co-morbidities. The most common findings are pulmonary arterial hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormalities, and decreased ejection fraction. There is a significant incidence of pulmonary embolism. In Italy, like elsewhere, there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care providers are getting sick and are also in short supply. The Italian government is hiring approximately 20,000 new health care providers including 5,000 physicians and physicians in training. For clinicians with any critical care experience, the most frequently used skill is ventilator management. Non-critical care COVID-19 patients are cared for by physicians from all specialties. All elective consultations and procedures have been cancelled. All face-to-face meetings and teaching are forbidden. All activity outside of the hospital is monitored by the police. Data from WHO suggests the American surge may be similar. 7",

[9] [10] [11] The addition of the strategic national supply, anesthesia machines and older ventilators not currently in use, should bring the total ventilator capacity to 200,000. Perhaps of greater importance, the Society of Critical Care Medicine estimates that there are only 135,000 professionals trained in mechanical ventilation. 9 The United States (US) capacity for providing professional staff for mechanical ventilation may be seriously challenged if the current transmission rate continues and 5-6% of the infected require ventilation. 12, 13 Cross training and hierarchical management may be necessary for managing the high volume of pulmonary disease. 9",

            "text": "Ultrasound is a valuable resource in this pandemic. Lung ultrasound, especially POCUS is a relative new technology and experience with COVID-19 is limited. 14, 15 Reporting from China and Italy indicates that sonography of the lung can reliably identify and quantify COVID-19 pleural and interstitial disease. 14, 15 Lung ultrasound is superior to conventional radiography for patients undergoing rapid evaluation for pneumonia and an attractive alternative in the intensive care unit. 16, 17 Lung ultrasound is routinely used to identify complications from pneumonia, ARDS and mechanical ventilation such as pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusions and pneumothorax. 18 Ultrasonography effectively monitors the progression of pulmonary disease by detecting lung inhomogeneity, cyclic alveolar recruitment/derecruitment and diaphragmatic injury from ventilator volume overload. 19 Wave elastography facilitates staging of interstitial lung disease including identification of early pulmonary fibrosis. 20 Ultrasonography effectively predicts successful weaning and extubation from mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS. [21] [22] [23] Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). Cross-training of echocardiographers and other personnel in pulmonary ultrasonography is effective and has been validated. 17 Standards for lung ultrasound in COVID-19 have recently been proposed. 24 A properly trained echocardiographer or intensivist wearing the maximum coverage personal protective equipment may be able to consecutively study numerous patients and perform serial examinations on individual patients as needed. In this scenario, the echocardiographer must be provided with the highest level of PPE and should be immersed in the COVID-19 environment for the minimum time necessary to complete the examinations. Consecutive shifts should be avoided. This will reduce the risk of delivering a high and potentially lethal viral load to the provider. 25 The studies should be transmitted to a remote reading area. Bedside nurses and physicians should not repeat the POCUS examination. This should reduce the number of individuals coming in contact with the infected patients, reduce the need for radiologic studies, decrease the consumption of personal protective equipment, improve the reproducibility of the examinations, and decrease transmission of disease. Lung ultrasonography performed by properly trained personnel is a useful strategy in the fight against this pandemic. 14, 15, 24 Surface echocardiography effectively screens for coronary artery disease and is essential for the rapid recognition of SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy. [26] [27] [28] [29] Coronary artery disease is one of the most common comorbidities associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. 30,31 SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy has been reported in 12% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 8 The fulminating myocarditis may be a result of direct viral infection or the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm. 32 Viral myocarditis is associated with a 40-70% mortality. Early aggressive therapy including mechanical support may reduce mortality from SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy. 32 Rapid diagnostic evaluation and guideline directed therapy is recommended. 29 Transthoracic echocardiography is essential for monitoring patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and lung ultrasonography is a promising tool for daily interstitial assessment of ARDS patients on ECMO. 33, 34 Echocardiography is portable and offers a clear advantage for reducing disease transmission by avoiding transporting patients through the hospital. 35 Mitigating transmission requires appropriate use of personal protective equipment, meticulous equipment care, and limiting attendance to essential personnel during imaging. Compared to a portable chest radiography, POCUS is less disruptive and may reduce direct patient contact. Point-of-care ultrasound devices are smaller and easier to disinfect than portable chest radiography machines. However, despite the higher risk of disease transmission, computerized tomography may be required for more comprehensive evaluation of the chest.",

All of these skills are required in communities hit hard by the pandemic.",

Each of the first-tier physicians can reasonably advise several cardiologists, surgeons, and other physicians with at least some expertise in critical care. In turn, each of the second-tier physicians then works with several third-tier mid-level providers and bedside nurses to supervise critical care. A similar hierarchical tiered approach may be used by the hospitalists and emergency physicians to expand non-critical inpatient and emergency department care. Telemedicine technology greatly facilitates communication between tiers and with outside expertise.",

The Advisory Committee to the CDC recommends that the committee include senior leadership from the medical staff, intensive care nursing, respiratory care, and ethics if available. 44 Triage physicians should not concomitantly provide bedside care. This allows the bedside clinician to preserve the patient-physician relationship and continue to advocate on behalf of the patient. Community commentary should be sought while developing the public health crisis triage protocols, especially with regards to involuntary withholding or withdrawal of life-support. These policies should be completely transparent, specifically identify the decision-makers, and explicitly clarify the patient population to whom they apply. At a minimum, public health officials, city council members, and members of other governing organizations should be involved and provide support to the triage committee.
