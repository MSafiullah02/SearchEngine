As of February 2, 2016, 1638 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the World Health Organization, including at least 587 deaths [1]. While MERS-CoV has affected 26 countries, the majority of cases have been reported in the Middle East [2]. Transmission has most commonly been associated with nosocomial outbreaks [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and is occasionally due to animal-to-human (most commonly camel-to-human) transmission and sporadic human-to-human transmission in the community [3], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Although the number of symptomatic cases resulting from secondary and tertiary transmission in human populations appears to be limited, little is known about potential human-to-human spread among asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals [3], [6], [11], [13].",

Older adults and those with comorbidities, such as diabetes, renal disease, respiratory disease, and immunosuppression, have been more commonly represented among those with severe illness [13], [14]. Younger and previously healthy individuals appear more likely to exhibit mild symptoms or be asymptomatic [5], [6], [11], [13], [15], [16]. The true incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic MERS-CoV cases remains unclear. Mild and asymptomatic cases may be misdiagnosed, which can lead to underreporting and misclassification of the disease and may also result in a possible detection bias depending on the type of health facility/unit that the patients seek treatment from. Health care workers appear to be at an increased risk of being infected with MERS-CoV, and this is likely mediated by inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and the amplification of cases amidst nosocomial outbreaks.",

While co-infections can be treated with specific antimicrobial and antiviral medications, potential agents to treat MERS-CoV infection have been derived from experience with non-influenza respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Case studies have reported on the outcomes of patients treated with oral ribavirin and interferon a2b. However, such studies are at a high risk of selection bias and confounding by indication because the inclusion of patients has largely depended on the severity of the illness. Such non-randomized allocations cannot separate the influence of many other potentially confounding conditions and co-interventions. Previous studies may also have been affected by the immortal time bias, as the patients needed to remain alive long enough to receive a particular therapy. All of these forms of bias and confounding variables preclude any valid estimation of the true treatment effect.",

However, many important questions remain. Although exposure to camels has been implicated in human MERS-CoV cases, all potential animal reservoirs have not yet been identified. Effective treatments and vaccines have also yet to be developed. Because of the sporadic nature of MERS-CoV outbreaks, a collaborative research effort across the most affected countries will be necessary to better assess the potential animal reservoirs, epidemiology, risk factors, and transmission of MERS-CoV to develop controlled and ideally blinded treatment evaluations. Research protocols and data collection tools should be prepared, vetted, approved, and pre-positioned across the Middle East and elsewhere to facilitate the timely implementation of research activities and close many of the remaining knowledge gaps.",
