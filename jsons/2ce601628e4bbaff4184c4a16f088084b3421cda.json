One recent study by Washam et al. demonstrated that during the winter respiratory viral season, visitors were a source of infection; creating a standardized, visitation restriction policy decreased hospital-acquired viral pathogens on non-ICU floors and influenza infections overall [14] . Hospital-acquired infections were decreased by 37% through limiting visitation by nonsiblings and ill visitors. In the ICUs, only four nonparent, nonlegal guardian persons on a fixed list were permitted to visit; later in the study, they changed this policy to apply hospital-wide and to allow six persons on a fixed list to visit. Restricting visitors was also shown to decrease respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in an open-room neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Peluso et al. in 2015 published RSV surveillance data from 2001-2010 in their NICU [33] . In 2007, they restricted the visitation of children less than 13 years old during RSV season (October-March); they found less frequent RSV infections, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with the more restrictive policy. The groups before and after 2007 were similar in characteristics, and the disease prevalence of RSV in the region remained constant during the study time period. Other studies in special units have examined the restriction of ill visitors and children as part of infection control bundles and seen a reduction in infections, for example, in adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) units and NICUs during RSV season [33, 34] . Some studies in adult ICUs have shown an increase in environmental contamination and even bioaerosols but no effect on the rate of hospital-acquired infections with liberalizing visitation policies; the same has been shown for NICUs [16, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .

Outbreaks are defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the occurrence of , guidance from updated health authorities (CDC and state health departments) is essential in developing specific visitation policies in those special circumstances. We would highly recommend consulting these authorities if a patient is suspected of having one of these pathogens. more cases of a disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time [50] . The screening and restriction of visitors, especially symptomatic visitors, is essential to prevent or control an outbreak. First, caregivers and adult visitors of pediatric patients with tuberculosis must be screened as described above. One report describes a tuberculosis outbreak that involved 24 children, including some immunocompromised patients, who had contact with a patient's mother with cavitary tuberculosis [51, 52] . An adult visitor was a source of two cases of latent tuberculosis infection in hospital staff members in another report [53] . Second, a report in 2005 of an RSV outbreak in a NICU suspected a sibling visitor to be the initial source which resulted in RSV infection in nine babies in open bassinets, five of whom required intubation and one required ECMO for 9 days [54] . The total hospital charge of the outbreak was $1.15 M. In response, control measures included limiting all visitors to those older than 13 years old who had no respiratory symptoms, contact precautions, and cohorting the infants infected with RSV. They also tested all NICU infants and administered palivizumab to uninfected infants, although the latter practice has since been discouraged by the AAP [55] . Third, norovirus, a highly contagious enteropathogen, frequently requires some type of visitor restriction [56, 57] . At a minimum, symptomatic visitors should be restricted, which has shown to aid in outbreak control [56] . One report of a large outbreak involving more than 500 patients and staff resorted to restricting all visitors after the limitation of symptomatic visitors did not curb a norovirus outbreak [57] . The limitation of symptomatic visitors has been used to prevent the outbreak of respiratory viruses, including influenza [53, 58, 59] . Finally, during the 2003-2004 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), visitors to the hospital were a significant part of the transmission cycle, including transmission to hospital staff, other patients, and the community [60] [61] [62] [63] . The control measures used first included using PPE for symptomatic visitors; later, visitor restriction and quarantine of both symptomatic individuals in their homes and of entire hospitals were used [63] . Screening measures of visitors and staff were also implemented, including body temperature screening and questionnaires. Even in extreme circumstances such as outbreaks of highly contagious or novel infections, including but not limited to SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and novel-H1N1 influenza, when visitor restriction is in place, parents and caregivers of hospitalized children typically remain at the bedside. Their bonding with and support for the patient, combined with the likelihood that they were exposed previously to the infectious agent before admission, supports continued caregiver presence [28, 41] . Indeed, many of the recommendations by SHEA are intended to be adjusted for parents and caregivers. A case-by-case analysis should be made in situations where the patient contracts an infection after admission; usually caregivers still remain at the bedside unless they themselves are immunocompromised. Visitation by other family members besides parents or caregivers depends on the infectious organism, the timing of illness, and the degree of contact that the family member had with the patient before and after admission. Those with less frequent contact with the patient should follow the isolation guidance outlined in Table 4 .1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 164, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1088, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1215, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1461, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1869, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1983, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1987, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2094, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2291, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2419, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2423, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2424, "end": 2427, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2670, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2671, "end": 2675, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2676, "end": 2680, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2685, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2892, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3534, "end": 3538, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3539, "end": 3542, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4170, "end": 4177, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Outbreaks"}, {"text": "In pediatrics, while parents have transitioned from being visitors to being an extension of the patient themselves and are indispensable to care and medical decisionmaking, siblings are still considered visitors.

It is known that younger children have a \"relatively high frequency of asymptomatic viral shedding and difficulties adhering to basic respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene practices\" [67, 86] . Initially, studies examined the bacterial colonization of healthy newborns who were visited by a sibling as a marker for risk of infection and found no cause for concern. In 1980, Umphenour examined nasal and umbilical swabs of newborns at admission and discharge in both a control group (N = 214) and intervention group (N = 182) with sibling visitation [87] . Of note, siblings who were obviously ill were asked to not come to the hospital; children that did visit underwent hand hygiene with an iodine scrub before interacting with the newborns who were rooming-in with their mothers. There was no difference in the two groups in terms of bacterial colonization in the newborn. Similar studies yielded the same results in support of well siblings visiting well newborns assuming aggressive hand hygiene is adhered to [82, 88, 89] . A survey of 69 hospitals showed that the majority of hospitals have an open visitation policy for siblings of newborns; however, rarely do hospitals observe visiting siblings for signs of illness [90] . Furthermore, more recent studies have shown that siblings can be a source of infection in the NICU. A report in 2005 of an RSV outbreak in a NICU suspected a visiting sibling as being the source of RSV that infected nine babies with serious consequences (as discussed above) [54] . In 2015, Peluso published data from their own NICU surveillance practices from 2001-2010 [33] . During the 2001-2002 season, they noted an increase in RSV infections after they heeded the AAP's encouragement to liberalize sibling visitation [65] . After they implemented age-based restrictions during RSV season (October-March), they found less frequent RSV infections, both asymptomatic and symptomatic. They suggest that applying visitation restriction can prevent RSV infection in open-room design NICUs but that it should be applied carefully so as to support families as much as possible. Studies examining the infection risk to hospitalized patients with sibling visitation outside the NICU are lacking. However, restriction of children, both siblings and nonsiblings, visiting the hospital remains a resource for infection control in times of outbreak [91] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "text": "86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "text": "[82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1254, "text": "88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1258, "text": "89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1461, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1839, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1991, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2609, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sibling Visitation"}, {"text": "Currently, there are no universal standards for sibling visitation in the NICU or hospital-wide [14, 82] .

If a sibling was known to be exposed to communicable disease, then their visit should be postponed. They also recommend that all vaccines be up to date, including influenza vaccine, and that these visiting well children should only visit their sibling and not be in contact with other patients. Each institution must evaluate the feasibility and process for these recommendations as they develop policies and procedures for their hospitals. The most important recommendation for all visitors, but especially siblings, is proper hand hygiene prior to and after visiting. One recent study at a quaternary children's hospital on healthcare-acquired respiratory infections found a 37% reduction in infections with a standardized visitation policy [14] . The policy did not limit sibling visitation but did exclude nonsibling children during the winter respiratory viral season. An informal review of the visiting policies listed on the websites of children's hospitals across the USA shows that parents have no restrictions on visitation. Siblings under 12-14 years old must be well to visit. Some hospitals limit sibling visitation depending on different factors, including specific visiting hours, contact isolation, influenza season, and location in the hospital [92, 93] . Special units like NICUs, BMT units, and PICUs have more restrictive policies; there, well siblings under the ages of 3-5 years old are usually prohibited from visiting [14] .

Other reports have found the presence of healthcare-associated strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in several species including dogs and cats.

One notable exception is a described MRSA outbreak, which occurred in a geriatric rehabilitation ward and was traced to a cat that roamed freely inside the hospital [108] . Despite the cited infection concerns, the overall risk of zoonosis transmission from animals to humans in healthcare facilities is likely very low, albeit the literature is rather sparse in this area. In part the low risk of transmission from animals to humans in the healthcare setting may be a reflection of dogs being used primarily in AAI as opposed to other animals with a higher risk of transmission of zoonotic infections (such as reptiles). Given the high prevalence of animals in American households, many patients will return to animal contact after leaving the hospital. Additionally, rates of zoonotic infections in the general American public are also relatively low. One study noted no increase in hospital infections after the introduction of AAI [100] .

Research to date examining the potential negative impacts of isolation practices has largely been conducted in adult patients and has sought to investigate if isolated patients, when compared to non-isolated patients, experience the following negative effects: a decrease in the quality of care, fewer interactions with healthcare workers, delays in care and adverse events, the presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and lower satisfaction with their care. Providers and families of hospitalized children have also worried about the psychosocial impacts of isolation practices. The following subchapter outlines some of the conflicting reports regarding the potential for untoward effects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adverse Impacts of Contact Precautions on Patient Care"}, {"text": "For decades, a principal concern has been that patients isolated for infection control, in addition to social stigmatization, may receive lower quality care. Several studies conducted in adult populations have documented that providers spent less time in patient rooms when patients were on isolation precautions regardless of the setting (wards or intensive care unit) and were less likely to enter the rooms of isolated patients when compared to non-isolated patients [129] [130] [131] . Another report published in 2003 noted that adult patients isolated for MRSA colonization or infection were less likely to have vital signs documented, had fewer daily physician progress notes, had twice as many preventable adverse events, and were more likely to formally complain about their care to the hospital when compared to control (nonisolated) patients [132] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 470, "end": 475, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 476, "end": 481, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 482, "end": 487, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 853, "end": 858, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Impact of Contract Precautions on the Quality of Care"}, {"text": "These reports are balanced, however, by two other studies conducted in pediatric settings which showed no differences in the quality of care or direct patient contact between isolated and non-isolated patients. The first, published in 1989, was conducted prospectively in a pediatric intensive care setting and demonstrated no difference in the frequency of contact by hospital personnel or family members between patients receiving isolation precautions and those receiving standard precautions [133] . Additionally, it was reported that patients tolerated contact isolation well, and there was no increase in adverse events between groups. The second study published in 2008 was a blinded prospective observational study and additionally reported no differences in time spent with isolated vs non-isolated patients on an acute care, general pediatrics service [134] . Study investigators reported on other quantitative measures including the number of organ systems examined, vital signs recorded, and other balance measures. Parent satisfaction questionnaires showed no differences in the caregiver perceived quality of care between isolated and nonisolated patients. These two studies cast doubt on the theory that the quality of care and patient satisfaction may be negatively impacted by the use of contact precautions, especially in pediatric care. Larger, multicenter studies focusing on pediatric inpatient care are needed however to better understand the true impacts of contact precautions on children's care and caregiver satisfaction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 501, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 862, "end": 867, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Impact of Contract Precautions on the Quality of Care"}, {"text": "Isolation practices can have profound psychosocial and behavioral impacts, however, and providers should strive to understand the implications of placing a patient on contact isolation. A hospital can be a frightening and anxiety-producing place for pediatric patients. To add to this, when a physician or hospital staff member enters a patient room dressed in a mask, gown, gloves, and/or other personal protective equipment (PPE), this will likely only worsen a sense of fear in a child. Contact precautions often may preclude the patient from leaving the room or moving to other areas of the hospital. A child's reaction to infection control practices is influenced by their age, development, and potentially parental or caretaker reaction to the measures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Psychosocial and Behavioral Impacts of Contact Precautions"}, {"text": "In adult studies, the data is again mixed. Higher depressions scores, anxiety scores, and anger-hostility scores have all been reported in isolated patients when compared to non-isolated patients suggesting that infection prevention measures have negative impacts on patient psychological well-being. [135] Patients have reported increased fear and loneliness while in isolation for infection reasons as well. It is worth noting that many of these symptoms seem to increase as the length of time in the hospital increased and short-term isolation practices may be less associated with increased depression and anxiety [136] . Other studies, however, have shown no differences in development of increased depression, anxiety, or other negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and worry [137, 138] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 306, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 618, "end": 623, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 786, "end": 791, "text": "[137,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Psychosocial and Behavioral Impacts of Contact Precautions"}, {"text": "In children, the psychological and behavioral effects of isolation practices are perhaps harder to quantify, and there is lack of recent literature in this area. A review published in 2013 draws attention to the lack of current literature examining the pediatric patient experience while in hospital isolation [139] . This review notes that much of the research conducted on the developmental impacts of source isolation is dated, occurring in the 1970s and 1980s, and often involves single patients, with a single disease process such as severe combined immunodeficiency, who were isolated for prolonged periods (months to years). More recent literature has examined patient and caretaker perspectives during outbreaks such as the 2003 SARS outbreak [140, 141] . These studies provide examples of extreme infection prevention precautions including complete separation of the child from the caregiver. Not unexpectedly, this form of isolation was associated with significant emotional distress including reported feelings of sadness, loneliness, worry, and fear among both patients and their caretakers. More common reasons for patient isolation, including upper and lower respiratory track viral infections, gastroenteritis, draining lesions and wounds, and MRSA infections to name a few, may affect a wide range of patients of different ages and cultures and may result in a range of time in the hospital.

Forsner et al. comment that medical care may cause profound fear and is even perceived as threatening to the very existence of the child [142] . School-age children often use magical and fantastical thinking to interpret the world around them, and medical care may be perceived as a danger or a \"monster\" that threatens to destroy the child, according to Forsner and colleagues. It is easy to see that the use of PPE may only worsen this perception by pediatric patients. Forsner reports as well that children under 7 years of age rely heavily on appearances when making assessments of potential threats. PPE can distort normal human appearance and prevent the ability of a child to interpret who is friendly and who is threatening. Children have expressed a sense of feeling overpowered and helpless in the medical environment. Hospital staff entering a room may outnumber the child and his or her parents or caretakers and this contributes to a sense of powerlessness. Medical environments include equipment necessary for providing care that may be perceived by a young child as being designed to cause harm including needles, other sharp objects, and even blood pressure cuffs. The addition of PPE can only add to this feeling that the intent of medical personnel is to harm the child. Children's narratives, as studied by Forsner, suggest that fear experienced is magnified when children feel objectified and their own feelings are not validated by those performing a procedure or examination. PPE may obscure the child's ability to see a provider smile, express empathy, or convey comforting gestures [142] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 241, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1710, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Psychosocial and Behavioral Impacts of Contact Precautions"}, {"text": "Confinement to a space due to isolation precautions is potentially detrimental situation for a child as well.

In the home environment, children may be punished by being told to stand in a corner or being sent to their room. Inability to leave a hospital room likely triggers strong associations to punishment for young children.

The first step toward reducing untoward effects is simply to avoid overuse. Providers should be cognizant of the potential for negative impacts and work closely with hospital infection control departments to effectively identify patients who are appropriate for contact precautions and appropriate timing for discontinuation of these precautions. National guidelines and recommendations (as outlined in this text) serve to guide practitioners toward the judicious use of these precautions. For patients on contact precautions, there should also be a daily reassessment by the medical team to determine if precautions can be removed. In the busy clinical environment, it is easy to overlook details such as contact precautions, and diligence in this area is necessary for all providers involved in the care of the child. The presence or absence of isolation precautions may be a memorable experience for families and patients and influence their perceived care. In the many instances, when contact precautions cannot be avoided, however, physicians and staff should consider bundling care and minimizing interruptions to the patient's day as well as minimizing the number of care providers in the room at a given time.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mitigation of the Negative Effects of Contact Precautions"}, {"text": "Adequate communication regarding the reasons for contact precautions is another important step to minimizing the negative effects. In a study published in 2000 in Nursing Standard, study authors note that clear and frequent communication about the need for contact precautions was highly impactful on patient satisfaction [143] . Similarly, in children, age appropriate communication and explanations regarding the reasons for contact isolation is very important. When speaking to a young school-aged child, for example, using the words, \"since you have the flu, when you cough, you could spread germs to other children and adults and make them sick too, and for this reason, we need you to stay in this room right now,\" is preferable to \"you have to stay in your room because you are sick.\" In the first example, specific language is used to clearly state why precautions are necessary.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 322, "end": 327, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mitigation of the Negative Effects of Contact Precautions"}, {"text": "Many pediatric facilities have access to child life trained staff who can be an invaluable resource to aiding the child and family with normalization activities, developing a routine, and integrating the \"outside\" into the patient's room. Decorating the room, bringing developmental activities to the patient room, and familiarizing the child with the hospital environment and equipment are all key strategies that can help with coping and anxiety relief especially in the setting of isolation practices. Familiarity with PPE may help decrease anxiety and fear, and when possible, care providers can allow children to touch and, when appropriate, play with equipment such as gloves and gowns. The use of technology can be highly effective in confronting the challenges of isolation practices as well. Teenagers and young children are increasingly engaged in social media, texting, and using video conferences with friends and family members, and the use of these technologies can help with social stimulation and relieve boredom. Cystic fibrosis patients, for example, are a particular group of patients who are often isolated in the hospital environment and have limited contact with peers who also have cystic fibrosis so as to decrease the bacterial and fungal pulmonary colonization risk.
