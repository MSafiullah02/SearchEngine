High-throughput, accurate, broad-range tools for etiologic diagnosis are critical for effective epidemic control. In this study, the diagnostic capacities of an Ibis platform based on the PCR/ESI-MS assay were evaluated using clinical samples. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 120 children (<5 years old) who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2011. The respiratory virus detection assay was performed using the PCR/ESI-MS assay and the DFA. The discordant PCR/ESI-MS and DFA results were resolved with RT-PCR plus sequencing. The overall agreement for PCR/ESI-MS and DFA was 98.3% (118/120). Compared with the results from DFA, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR/ESI-MS assay were 100% and 97.5%, respectively. The PCR/ESI-MS assay also detected more multiple virus infections and revealed more detailed subtype information than DFA. Among the 12 original specimens with discordant results between PCR/ESI-MS and DFA, 11 had confirmed PCR/ESI-MS results. Thus, the PCR/ESI-MS assay is a high-throughput, sensitive, specific and promising method to detect and subtype conventional viruses in respiratory tract infections and allows rapid identification of mixed pathogens.",

Recent advances in molecular biology, particularly the introduction of the real-time PCR assay, have improved greatly the detection of individual viral respiratory pathogens [Louie et al., 2005] and promoted the development of multiplex assays that can detect simultaneously multiple pathogens in a single test. Some of these multiplex technologies have potential applications in high-throughput testing, and others allow rapid, near-patient testing. However, these assays are still not used widely in clinical laboratories, and most are currently available only for research use. More studies are needed to elucidate their performance characteristics and to determine their ideal clinical applications [Caliendo, 2011] .",

PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% (w/v) agarose gels and stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide.",

This assay uses the principle of measuring the mass of the PCR amplicon based on the nucleo- tide base composition (i.e., the number of A, G, C, and T nucleotides for that DNA molecule). Compared with conventional antigen detection by DFA, PCR/ ESI-MS showed high-throughput capacity. It can also simultaneously detect and type multiple clinically relevant respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with lower respiratory tract infections. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR/ESI-MS were found to be 100% and 97.5%, respectively. Consistent with other clinical trial data [Chen et al., 2011a [Chen et al., , 2011b , PCR/ESI-MS demonstrated several advantages over regular DFA in detecting respiratory viruses. First, the time to first result from sample preparation to detection of PCR/ESI-MS was 6 hr: 0.5 hr of RNA extraction, 3 hr of RT-PCR, and 2.5 hr of processing in ESI-MS. The estimated throughput of PCR/ESI-MS was 90 samples with automatic nucleic acid extraction, using one technician working for 8 hr, which represented 1,530 PCR reactions. However, DFA may require at least two persons to complete the same number of samples within one working day. Second, more viruses were detected using PCR/ESI-MS, especially PIV3, INF A, and RSV. These viruses are the major viral agents that cause lower respiratory tract infections, but their prevalence may be underestimated because of the low sensitivity of DFA [Sloots et al., 2008] . Third, nine viral co-infection samples were verified by PCR/ ESI-MS, whereas only two were detected by DFA. Dual viral infections were predominant, but co-infections with three different viruses were observed in two samples. As of this writing, the clinical importance of such multiple viral infections remains uncertain [Paranhos-Baccala et al., 2008] . Our findings indicated that PCR/ESI-MS can provide more information than DFA on viral co-infections in patients. The additional data will help in clarifying the association of the simultaneous presence of more than one viral pathogen with epidemiological and clinical features that differ from those in single infections, especially with respect to disease type and severity. Fourth, a more detailed pathogen characterization, especially type and subtype information from RSV, adenovirus, and INF, was obtained directly and rapidly using PCR/ESI-MS. Such detailed information was not obtained using DFA or conventional PCR. The key feature of this new technology is the use of MS to quickly and accurately detect the amplicons and \"weigh\" them with sufficient mass accuracy to determine the nucleotide base compositions that are associated with sequence information to identify and genotype the virus in the sample.",

Moreover, the fact that no coronavirus was detected by PCR/ESI-MS and DFA in this study which was similar to that in another report [Chen et al., 2011b] showed the low detection rate of conronavirus and indicated that more specimens need to be collected for evaluating the diagnostic characteristic of PLEX-ID respiratory kit on conronavirus. Unlike other assays based on antigen detection or nucleic acid amplification, which are limited to the detection of known microbes, PCR/ ESI-MS is suitable for discovery of pathogens and evaluation of emerging pathogens. In PCR/ESI-MS, the base compositions are compared with a database of calculated base compositions from the sequences of known organisms to determine the identities of the microorganisms present. However, when no match is found between the measured base composition and the database, the nearest neighbor organism is identified. Thus, PCR/ESI-MS provides information about pathogens in a sample without having to anticipate the pathogens that might be present [Caliendo, 2011] . This unique technology will be helpful in the rapid identification of pathogens with regard to emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and outbreaks.",
