            "text": "Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that plays a major role in almost all cellular processes in eukaryotes (Hochstrasser, 2009; Komander & Rape, 2012). It involves the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) via its C-terminal glycine carboxylate to a primary amine of a target protein, generally to a lysine side chain resulting in an isopeptide bond. Ub itself can also be ubiquitinated and as such give rise to polyUb chains. This conjugation occurs at the side chain of one of the seven internal lysine residues (Lys-6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48, 63), resulting in an isopeptide bond, or at the N-terminus (Met-1), resulting in a linear Ub chain, and it has been shown that all eight linkages coexist in cells (Xu et al., 2009).",

Nearly a hundred genes encoding DUBs have been identified in the human genome, which can be classified in seven distinct families. The subfamilies of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH), Ovarian TUmor domain proteases (OTU), Machado-Joseph disease proteases (MJD), Motif interacting with ubiquitin-containing novel DUB family (MINDY), and Zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protein (ZUFSP) are cysteine proteases, whereas JAB1/MPN/MOV34 proteases (JAMMs) are zinc-dependent metalloproteases (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016; Komander, Clague, & Urbe, 2009; Kwasna et al., 2018; Nijman et al., 2005; Reyes-Turcu, Ventii, & Wilkinson, 2009). As distinct Ub linkages result in distinct biological signals (Komander & Rape, 2012; Yau & Rape, 2016), the determination of the linkage specificities of DUBs gives fundamental insights into the biological pathways they are involved in. It has been shown that some DUBs, mainly USPs, are able to process all isopeptide linked chains (Faesen et al., 2011) whereas others, especially OTUs, display a preference for one or a few Ub chain types (Mevissen et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Another level of complexity is based on the existence of Ub-like proteins (Ubls) (Kerscher, Felberbaum, & Hochstrasser, 2006). These posttranslational modifiers share structural homology to Ub as well as a highly similar system for conjugation and deconjugation. The most studied examples are the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO), the neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 8 (Nedd8) and interferon-stimulated gene of 15 kDa (ISG15). SUMOylation plays a key role in genome stability, and many of its protein targets are involved in DNA-damage responses (e.g., PCNA and BRCA1) (Flotho & Melchior, 2013). Nedd8 plays an important role in cell cycle control and its main targets are Cullin proteins, which are Ub ligase subunits (Soucy, Smith, & Rolfe, 2009). ISG15 is strongly induced by Type-I interferons as part of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections (Zhang & Zhang, 2011). Similar to the Ub system, specific proteases deconjugate Ubls from their targets. These include SENPs acting on SUMO (Hickey, Wilson, & Hochstrasser, 2012), USP18 acting on ISG15 (Malakhov, Malakhova, Kim, Ritchie, & Zhang, 2002) and DENs acting on Nedd8 (Gan-Erdene et al., 2003) and we refer to this group of proteases as Ubl-specific proteases.",

Best studied is the crosstalk between Ub and SUMO signaling, which includes the identification of ubiquitinated SUMO and SUMOylated Ub (Hendriks et al., 2014; Hendriks & Vertegaal, 2016; Nie et al., 2016; Nie & Boddy, 2016). Furthermore, ubiquitinated Nedd8 and crosstalk between Ub and Nedd8 signaling pathways have also been reported (Leidecker, Matic, Mahata, Pion, & Xirodimas, 2012; Singh, Sundar, & Fushman, 2014), as the existence of ISGylated ubiquitin (Fan et al., 2015). However, these so-called heterogeneous chains have so far remained largely unstudied, and their functions remain unknown (Swatek & Komander, 2016).

For example, proteases derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) have been shown to deconjugate both Ub and ISG15 in order to suppress innate immune responses (Barretto et al., 2005; Bekes et al., 2016; Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Lindner et al., 2005; Mielech, Kilianski, Baez-Santos, Mesecar, & Baker, 2014). In contrast to eukaryotic DUBs, proteases encoded by pathogens (bacteria and viruses) often deconjugate more than one type of Ubl. Another example is the CE clan bacterial effector proteases from, for instance, Rickettsia bellii and Chlamydia trachomatis, which were shown to display both deubiquitinating and deNeddylating activities (Lin & Machner, 2017; Pruneda et al., 2016).",

            "text": "For many human DUBs and Ubl-specific proteases, it has been shown that their malfunction contributes to human disease, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Harrigan, Jacq, Martin, & Jackson, 2018); therefore, tools to study them in detail and on a molecular level are of great interest. Often, proteases are translated as inactive proenzymes, requiring posttranslational activation by their natural regulators. In addition, their activity may be controlled by posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or methylation. In order to study the role of DUBs in biological processes, it is therefore insufficient to simply monitor the enzyme's abundance by antibody staining, proteomics, or mRNA quantification because this is not necessarily related to a protein's activity (Hewings, Flygare, Bogyo, & Wertz, 2017). A powerful method to visualize enzyme activities in a complex biological setting is the use of Activity-Based Probes (ABPs) (Ovaa, 2007; Verdoes & Verhelst, 2016). ABPs come in many flavors and their design is predominantly determined by their respective protein target(s) and the particular application of the ABP. Generally, ABPs comprise a recognition element, that directs the ABP toward its target, attached to a reactive group (or \u201cwarhead\u201d) that reacts with the enzyme's active site to form a covalent adduct, either reversible or irreversible, depending on the type of enzyme and reactive group installed (see Fig. 1\n). The recognition element is designed to resemble structural and functional motifs of the natural substrate of the target, in the form of a short peptide, carbohydrate, nucleoside, or even a small protein. A variety of ABPs has been developed to study the activities of DUBs and these all share a common recognition element derived from full-length Ub. Typically, but not necessarily, an ABP is also equipped with a reporter group, such as a fluorophore, radioactive label or affinity tag, which is used for visualization, purification or identification of the ABP-bound target(s).",

            "text": "These chemical tools are designed in such a way that they only bind to active enzymes covalently but do not react with their inactive counterparts. The application of ABPs is widespread. For example, these tools are commonly used in combination with mass spectrometry, to capture, isolate, and identify active enzymes from cells or cell extracts (Cravatt, Wright, & Kozarich, 2008). In addition, ABPs can be applied to determine the active fraction of a recombinantly expressed and purified enzyme or to study the effect of specific enzyme modifications or mutations with respect to the enzyme's activity and its substrate specificities (Mevissen et al., 2013, Mevissen et al., 2016). ABPs are also very useful tools for gaining insight into the structural characteristics of an enzyme, where an enzyme\u2013ABP complex mimics a certain state of the reaction between the enzyme and its substrate (Basters et al., 2017; van Tilburg, Elhebieshy, & Ovaa, 2016). Also, by designing and testing different structural variants of an ABP (Flierman et al., 2016; Mulder, El Oualid, ter Beek, & Ovaa, 2014), one can identify preferences of a given enzyme for certain structural features (Bekes et al., 2015, Bekes et al., 2016; Mevissen et al., 2016). Finally, since only the active fraction of an enzyme is labeled by the ABP, it is possible to check the inhibitory potential of an inhibitor toward one or multiple enzymes in a cell or cell lysate, e.g., by means of an ABP competition assay (Altun et al., 2011; de Jong et al., 2012).",

The electron-poor vinyl motifs in UbVME and UbVS act as a Michael acceptor elements that trap the sulfur nucleophile of the active site cysteine under the formation of a covalent, irreversible bond. Later on, the total chemical synthesis of Ub (and mutants thereof) using solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) (El Oualid et al., 2010; Kumar, Haj-Yahya, Olschewski, Lashuel, & Brik, 2009; Pasunooti et al., 2009) opened the way to prepare Ub-ABPs carrying fluorescent labels or affinity handles on a large scale (de Jong et al., 2012). Unexpectedly, it was found that the C-terminal amide derivative of Ub1\u201375 with propargylamine (Ub-Prg or Ub-PA) is also able to covalently trap the active site cysteine of DUBs by formation of a stable vinyl thioether (Fig. 2A) (Ekkebus et al., 2013).",

This so-called S1 pocket in the protease holds the Ub molecule so that its C-terminus with the reactive element is positioned in close proximity to the active site cysteine of the protease. With this positioning, the two reacting partners are optimally aligned to allow formation of a covalent adduct. In a normal reaction with a ubiquitinated species, the DUB would be able to cleave the amide bond between substrate and Ub, resulting in free substrate and Ub, but due to the nature of the warhead, a covalent adduct is formed in the case of ABPs. Along this line, similar ABPs for Ubl-specific proteases have been developed by replacing the C-terminal residue in the respective Ubl for an electrophilic moiety, such as -Prg, -VME, or -VS and these include ABPs based on SUMO1,- 2, \u2212 3, Nedd8, ISG15, and UFM1. Currently, many of these Ub and Ub-like ABPs are commercially available but are also readily obtained by chemical synthesis (Basters et al., 2017; Ekkebus et al., 2013; Mulder et al., 2018; Witting et al., 2018), or semisynthesis, such as the use of intein chemistry for Ub(l)\u0394G-thioester formation, followed by reaction of this thioester with an amine nucleophile (Hemelaar et al., 2004).",

Classically, in order to study possible linkage preferences, a recombinantly expressed and purified DUB is incubated with each of the seven native isopeptide-linked diUb molecules. Cleavage of the diUb molecules is then monitored over time using gel-based analyses. A major limitation of this methodology is that the results are not readily extrapolatable to the substrate preference of a DUB in a more complex environment, such as cell-lysate, which might modulate DUB activity and preference due to other factors present in such samples. To overcome these issues, ABPs to investigate linkage specific proteolysis of DUBs have been developed, that can be utilized in complex biological systems such as cell lysates. These probes generally consist of two ubiquitin moieties equipped with a Michael acceptor element in the isopeptide linkage region in between the two Ub moieties (often referred to as \u201cin-between\u201d diUb probes). Initial reports show the two Ub regions to be linked together using nonnative connections such as a triazole (McGouran, Gaertner, Altun, Kramer, & Kessler, 2013) and a thiolether linkage (Li, Liang, Gong, Tencer, & Zhuang, 2014). Two types of probes, containing either a dehydroalanine (Dha) (Haj-Yahya et al., 2014) or VME-like electrophilic trap (Mulder et al., 2014) (see Fig. 2B), mimic the native lysine\u2013glycine isopeptide linkage the closest.",

The reaction between the enzyme and an ABP becomes apparent from the shift of a protein band to a higher molecular weight equal to the total mass of enzyme plus ABP. Here, the UCH-L3 band around 25 kDa shifts to a ~ 35 kDa band with either the Ub- or Nedd8 ABP. Similarly, the SENP1 band shifts from ~ 26 to ~ 40 kDa when incubated with either of the SUMO probes. It is to note here that SUMO proteins run somewhat higher than what would be expected from their mass. Finally, the USP18 corresponding band shifts from ~ 38 to ~ 43 kDa and ~ 50 kDa upon incubation with the truncated ISG15c ABP or the full-length ISG15, ABP respectively. From this result it follows that USP18 does not require full-length ISG15 for proper binding but that the C-terminal domain alone is enough, which corroborates earlier published results (Basters et al., 2017).",

In contrast, the monoUb-probe does react with the protease but more slowly, showing a similar extend of labeling only after 15 min of incubation time (see Fig. 5A, lanes 2\u20133). The protease shows little reactivity toward the K48-linked \u201cin-between\u201d-probe, showing only marginal complex formation after 15 min (see Fig. 5A, lanes 4\u20135). This experiment shows the strong dependency of this DUB on an S2-site to bind diUb-molecules or longer Ub chains (Bekes et al., 2016). These results are in line with previous findings showing SARS-CoV PLpro to have a di-distributive mode of action (Bekes et al., 2015). A crystal structure of the K48-diUb \u201cproximal\u201d-probe in complex with the enzyme has allowed a detailed look at this S2-site and pin-pointed important interactions contributing to this strong S2 dependency in the DUB's proteolytic profile (Bekes et al., 2016).",

The MERS-CoV DUB reacts fast with the monoUb-probe showing complete labeling within 1 min (Fig. 5B, lanes 2\u20133). Both diUb-probes are also processed by the DUB, but more slowly as roughly 50% of the protease is labeled after 15 min (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 7). When looking at the \u201cin-between\u201d probe a notable increase in labeling is observed when comparing the two time points (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5), whereas for the \u201cproximal\u201d probe no increase in labeling is observed after 1 min (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7). These results might indicate that recognition of the Ub-substrate by MERS-CoV PLpro primarily occurs using the S1-site and additional substrate context either on the proximal or distal site of this recognized Ub-moiety is tolerated, however slowing down the proteolysis event.",

            "text": "When using ABPs to study DUB substrate preferences, finding the correct reaction time window is crucial because measurements at different times may result in different outcomes. The SARS-CoV PLpro for instance (Fig. 5A) shows a preference for the K48-linked diUb \u201cproximal\u201d probe (lane 6) over the monoUb-Prg probe (lane 2) at short incubation times, whereas at longer incubation times the amount of labeling for both seems to be identical (lanes 3 and 7). The same holds true for MERS PLpro (Fig. 5B), where at 15 min incubation the difference between \u201cin-between\u201d-probe and \u201cproximal\u201d-probe (lanes 5 and 7) is less pronounced then at short incubation times (lanes 4 and 6). One way to overcome making assumptions based on such time-dependent snapshots of enzyme activity is to measure full kinetic parameters of the DUBs. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics can be measured based on fluorogenic (di)Ub substrates that start to emit a fluorescent signal upon DUB activity. Rather than forming a covalent complex with the DUB, these substrates are processed by the DUB in a normal way, liberating a fluorescent molecule. As such, the appearance of the fluorescent signal is a direct measure of DUB activity, that can be followed in real-time. Both \u201cproximal\u201d diUb and monoUb substrates have been generated and compliment the toolbox of ABPs to study DUBs (Dang, Melandri, & Stein, 1998; Flierman et al., 2016).",

Since the first ABP targeting DUBs, the field has brought forth an assortment of tools enabling profound insights into the structural, biochemical, and biological role of these enzymes. Although these advancements have helped gain insights into the functions of DUBs, it is becoming increasingly clear that these ABPs require innovation to address outstanding questions. The generation of tools specifically designed for dissecting the proteolytic processing of ubiquitin chains have revealed profound differences among these proteases in their specificity. Adding to this complexity, the discovery of heterotypic and hybrid Ub chains warrants the development of customized tools in order to understand the regulatory roles of DUBs in this context. Other outstanding questions include the development of ABPs capable of capturing metalloprotease DUBs, ABPs targeting a single DUB-type specifically and optimization of cell delivery methodologies for ABPs to enable in-cell enzymology.",
