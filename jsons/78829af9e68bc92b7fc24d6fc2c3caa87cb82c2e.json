She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 hours associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs. Because of the encephalitis, fluent aphasia and mild right limbs weakness persisted, with only a partial recovery after neuro-rehabilitation. Since then, the patient was steadily under treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam and remained seizure-free for more than two years. She was under regular neurologic follow-up and the last electroencephalogram performed ten days prior to admission was normal ( Figure 1 ultrasound were negative for interstitial pneumonia. Since then, no other seizures occurred. During the hospitalization, she did not require oxygen therapy. On 28 th March she was discharged in stable condition, afebrile after two negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2.",

The neuroinvasive propensity has been reported to be a common feature of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which is able to enter J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f into the cells that express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 2 ",

Our patient developed a focal status epilepticus as the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a predisposing but well-controlled post-encephalitic epilepsy. Noteworthy, in our patient the disease did not express an important pulmonary involvement (she did not develop pneumonia nor did she require oxygen therapy). The limitation of this case is the absence of a proven central nervous system invasion by the virus (i.e. lumbar puncture and a PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid were not performed). Nevertheless, standing the atypical disease presentation and chronological correlation of symptoms, it is possible to hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 could trigger seizures through a neurotropic pathogenic mechanism.",

The patient displayed ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right eyelid and upper-lip, started two hours before. She was treated with intravenous valproic acid, followed by intravenous midazolam for the persistence of subintrant focal seizures. The electroencephalogram revealed semi-rhythmic, irregular, high amplitude delta activity, predominantly lateralized over the left fronto-centro-temporal regions, consistent with focal status epilepticus (Figure 1, labels B-C). The antiepileptic treatment resolved the status epilepticus (Figure 1, label D). Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute lesions. Brain MRI confirmed extensive gliosis and atrophy involving the left temporo-parietal lobe, in the 3 ). Twelve hours after the admission to the Emergency Room, the patient developed fever. She did not exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnoea. Her blood oxygenation was normal. The blood analysis showed a further decrease in the white cells and platelets count.The C-reactive protein was 29.7 mg/L, procalcitonine was 0.07 ng/ml. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, her fever did not improve. Blood cultures and urine culture were negative for common bacteria, fungi and neurotropic viruses. The epidemiological survey revealed that in the previous week the patient met her son, who went into preventive isolation afterwards for being in contact with three people with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs specimen of the patient were then obtained and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit and treated with lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. After initiation of the treatment, the clinical conditions of the patient improved, with resolution of the fever. A further chest X-ray (Figure 2, label F) and a lung",
