HSV-1 is the main cause of oral infection, affecting the mouth and lips, while HSV-2 is mostly linked to genital herpes. It is estimated that approximately 45\u201398% of the world\u2019s population are seropositive for HSV-1, while about 7% are seropositive for HSV-2 (Fatahzadeh and Schwartz, 2007). In the United States alone, about 40\u201363% of people are infected with HSV-1, and 16% are infected with HSV-2. The persistence of HSV-2 increases yearly, with 500,000 new cases in the United States (Fatahzadeh and Schwartz, 2007).",

The HSV life cycle begins when viral glycoproteins bind host epithelial cellular receptors. The viral glycoprotein D (gD) is the main determinant of cellular binding and fusion (Spear et al., 2006). Upon binding to a suitable host cell receptor such as nectin-1, nectin-2, herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) or 3-O-sulfated (3-OS) heparan sulfate (HS), gD forms a fusion complex with gB, gH, and gL. This complex allows the viral envelope to fuse to the host cellular plasma membrane and consequently virus entry into the host cell (Spear et al., 2006, Subramanian and Geraghty, 2007). Next, the viral nucleocapsid is transported to the host cell nucleus where viral replication and transcription takes place (Garner, 2003). To outsmart the host\u2019s immune system, the virus also achieves latent stage by infecting neuronal cells. While latent, the virus is dormant until re-stimulated into the lytic cycle. In this way, HSV is able to propagate itself for the lifetime of the infected host (Kramer et al., 2003).",

Previously, we have showed the antiviral efficacy of the major catechin constituent in green tea, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and its ester modification, palmitoyl-EGCG in combating HSV-1 infection in Vero cells (de Oliveira et al., 2013). Crude black tea extract has also been shown to contain anti-herpesviral activity and theaflavins may be the major antiviral players (Cantatore et al., 2013). Here, we want to determine the effect of purified individual black tea theaflavins against HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, theaflavins share many of the structural characteristics of green tea catechins, suggesting that it may also be an effective compound against HSV infections. Thus, application of these agents as natural topical remedy to prevent and treat HSV-1 infection and spreading is promising.",

The expression and localization of tegument-GFP was observed using a confocal microscope at 12 h post infection. Cells were stained with DAPI and the cell nucleus was analyzed for potential cytopathic effect. Upon infection, the pUL46-GFP tegument protein associates with cellular membranes and localizes throughout the cytoplasm as distinct puncta (Murphy et al., 2008, Willard, 2002). As shown in Fig. 6, a significant level of pUL46-GFP expression was observed in the untreated HSV-1 control (B; B\u2032) and DMSO treated HSV-1 control (C; C\u2032) in both Vero and A549 infected cells. Contrarily, 75 \u03bcM TF3 treated HSV-1 infected cells (D; D\u2032) did not show GFP positive granules, but instead, it closely resembled the uninfected cells control (A; A\u2032). Overall, the results indicate that treatment of HSV-1 with 75 \u03bcM TF3 significantly affect the HSV-1 life cycle in both Vero and A549 cells.",

Despite effective antiviral therapy, the virus has been shown to develop resistant strains, especially in immunocompromised hosts (Bacon et al., 2003). The virus acquires mutations in the thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme and/or the viral DNA polymerase gene and can thus bypass any antiviral effect the drug would have produced (Bacon et al., 2003, Piret and Boivin, 2011).
