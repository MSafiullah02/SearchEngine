The authors drive the reader through repurposed drugs, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two agents used for malaria (prevention and treatment) and chronic inflammatory diseases (treatment); old antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir, used for HIV, and oseltamivir, used for influenza; interferon-alpha and -beta; and antihelminthic agents. Pending the evaluation of these agents, no convincing results are available that could lead to safe and curative [1] .

Remdesivir, the most advanced drug, already used for the treatment of Ebola, has recently received emergency authorisation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of some COVID-19 patients, but more than 100 other potential agents have demonstrated potential activity against coronaviruses. Finally, the authors give a wide but deceptive perspective on adjunctive therapies, including corticosteroids, for which published results remain at least negative or potentially harmful; anti-cytokine and immunomodulatory agents still under investigation despite their inclusion in the Chinese national treatment guidelines; and immunoglobulin therapy, with only anecdotal results that are impossible to interpret. of extreme medical tension generates its share of numerous publications, especially in cases of limited therapeutic options. Although at a lower level, similar observations were made when the SARS or MERS viruses emerged or when the first carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were reported, even if the timeline was quite different.

Similar to any other new anti-infective agents, the evaluation of new antiviral therapies deserves ambitious therapeutic objectives based on relevant criteria and strong methodology. We need large-scale, multinational, randomised control trials, ideally in double-blind fashion, comparing a single agent with the reference management. Because of a pre-symptomatic contagious period of COVID-19 disease, the comparison of prophylactic regimens and curative approaches should also be investigated, possibly showing different capacities at various stages of the disease. Many conditions need to be specifically the presence of underlying diseases, risks of clinical worsening, severity of the disease, age and sex. Pharmacokinetic issues must also be investigated, including the dosage, duration of therapy, and comparison between blood monitoring and pharmacodynamic targets.Life-threatening forms of COVID-19 should also be investigated in detail, but there is very little time to carry out these investigations with thoroughness and regularity. These desperate conditions are no reason to give anyone the licence to do anything. Compassionate use is obviously an interesting and generous approach, but the question arises of how to evaluate new anti-infective agents in times of emergency. The evaluation of multiple drugs in a single multi-arm trial such as the European Discovery trial gains time. However, even if favourable results are obtained, it would not be enough to consider these therapeutics as routine options. Multi-arm adaptative designs are more efficient, informative and ethical than fixed-design trials[5]. They can be used through all phases of clinical research. Their principle aims at favouring a drug at the expense of another one if interim analysis brings promising signals. Today, more than 42 multi-arm studies are recruiting COVID-19 patients worldwide, as reported by ClinicalTrials.gov.",
