            "text": "India, Bangladesh and the Philippines adding up to 666 human infections, 388 deaths and a mortality rate of around 60% according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other recent reports (Arunkumar et al., 2018; Ching et al., 2015; Chua, 2003; Sourimant & Plemper, 2016) . Of note, in February 2018, NiV infection was listed by the WHO as one of the priority diseases posing a public health risk. In May 2018, a NiV outbreak was reported in Kerala, India, with 23 identified human cases (18 laboratory-confirmed cases) and 21 deaths, being the third NiV outbreak known to occur in India (Arunkumar et al., 2018) . Unlike the initial outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore, human-to-human transmission played an important role in the spread of NiV during the outbreaks in India, Bangladesh and the Philippines (Arankalle et al., 2011; Arunkumar et al., 2018; Chadha et al., 2006; Ching et al., 2015; Gurley et al., 2007; Luby et al., 2009 ). An epidemiological investigation on Bangladesh human cases of Nipah virus infection during [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] shows that more than half of human infections caused by human-to-human transmission (Luby et al., 2009 ). In addition to bats of the genus Pteropus, NiV also naturally infects animals more closely related to humans, such as pigs, goats, horses, dogs and cats (AbuBakar et al., 2004; Ching et al., 2015; Chua, 2003; Chua et al., 2000) . This wide host range may be due to the two cell receptors for NiV, ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, which are highly conserved across many species (Bonaparte et al., 2005; Negrete et al., 2005 Negrete et al., , 2006 Xu, Broder, & Nikolov, 2012) . Due to its high lethality, the lack of effective vaccines or treatments and the re-emergence of deadly zoonotic NiV in South and Southeast Asia that suggested human-to-human transmission, greater outbreaks of NiV might be possible in the future.",

When stablishing in a new host, NiV has to adapt to novel conditions, a process that provides strong selection pressure. Little is known about the NiV genomic changes required for its transmission to humans, in line with the lack of knowledge on common genetic 'host jump' rules from bats to humans or to other mammals. Here, we combined phylogenetic with selection analysis and structural biology to understand the role of different NiV lineages in interspecies transmission and the role of adaptive evolution during transmission from bats to new hosts in relation to structural and functional changes. Moreover, we investigate a possible increase in pathogenicity and the ability for human transmission and the genetic and evolutionary dynamics of NiV from the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages.",

Further analysis performed by SimPlot 3.5.1 indicated that the event was a false-positive result (data not shown). Since there was no recombination event interfering the construction of phylogenetic trees, all full-genome sequences and sequences of each gene were used to reconstruct ML trees. N gene tree has apparently more complex structure than full-genome tree since more N sequences were used in the analysis. In both ML trees, NiV all could be divided into two main lineages: the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages, and only NiV from the Bangladesh lineage circulate in India and Bangladesh while in Malaysia only NiV from the Malaysia lineage circulate (Figure 1 ), as reported previously (Lo et al., 2012; Lo Presti et al., 2016; Rahman et al., 2010) . Analysis based on a large number of N coding sequences (Figure 1b) revealed human and bat-derived NiV in Bangladesh lineage and a more complicated structure in the Malaysia lineage including viruses derived from multiple hosts (bat, swine and human), which is corresponding to the different transmission modes of two lineages (Av et al., 2018) . Of note, NiV belonging to different lineages was observed in local bat population of Thailand and Cambodia, and this phenomenon in Thailand was previously reported while NiV from Cambodia bats was formerly thought to only belong to Malaysian lineage, which could be the result of the analysis of additional Cambodia bats sequences obtained in 2013 (Lo et al., 2012; Reynes et al., 2005; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010 Wacharapluesadee et al., , 2005 Wacharapluesadee et al., , 2016 . In addition, NiV could be divided into these two lineages based on ML trees reconstructed based on other coding sequences ( Fig S1) , which is similar to the results of previous studies (Lo et al., 2012) . BaTS analysis revealed that the NiV p-value of AI and PS was less than .05 (Table 1) and apart from the MC p-value of Cambodia which was 1, the p-values of other countries were less than .05. This is consistent with the structure of phylogenetic trees and indicates a significant geographic association.",

In ephrin-B2, three conservative amino acid differences became apparent: T93 is replaced by S, I111 by V and K106 by R in the bat receptor (labelled as red sticks in Figure 3c , except K106 which is a purple stick). Especially, interesting is residue 106, which forms a salt bridge with E510 in G. This salt bridge is also present in the structure of G bound to ephrin-B3, but here a K instead of an R is present. Both of these basic and positively charged amino acids are apparently capable to form a salt bridge with E501, but since the side chain of K is larger than the side chain of R, the distance of this salt bridge is shorter (2.8 \u00c5) in G bound to mammalian ephrin-B2 compared with G bound to mammalian ephrin-B3 (4.3 \u00c5).",

Thus, NiV is highly variable, which makes disease prevention, control and vaccine development difficult. Of note, we found a significant relationship between NiV and geography, except for Cambodia, which may be due to the limited number of available sequences from this region. This indicates that once NiV is epidemic in one area, it differentiates into a new lineage that adapts to the local background. This adaption also causes a fast rate of evolution.",

None of the G protein adaptive sites are in direct contact with amino acids of ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3. However, adaptive amino acids were identified near the second interaction site which comprises a hydrogen-bonding network between Q388 and Y389 in G and the negatively charged D108 in both ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 and a salt bridge between negatively charged E501 in G and a basic residue at position 106 in ephrin. Interestingly, the identity of the basic amino acid varies: in bats and other mammalians ephrin-B3 and in the bat ephrin-B2 it is an arginine, whereas in the mammalian ephrin-B2 a lysine is present. Since the side chain of lysine is longer, the distance between E501 in G and the basic residue in ephrin becomes shorter and as a consequence probably the strength of the interaction increases.
