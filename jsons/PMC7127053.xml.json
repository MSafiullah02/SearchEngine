            "text": "Viruses are very small microorganisms, ranging in size from 15 to 400 nm (examples, see Fig. 1\n). Viruses cause a wide range of diseases in plants, animals and humans. These infections do not occur at random: each group of viruses has its own typical host range and cell preference (called tropism). Viruses can be transmitted in different ways, for example by droplets generated when an infected person coughs, by contamination with stool samples from a person infected with an intestinal virus, by sexual intercourse, by contact with blood from infected persons with bloodborne viruses, by contact with infected animals with zoonotic viruses, or by vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks for arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Clearly the most relevant in foodborne infections are those viruses that infect the cells lining the intestinal tract and are dispersed by shedding into the stool or through emesis (Table 1)\n. Some general features of foodborne viral infections and important differences from foodborne bacterial infections are:\u2022Only a few particles are needed to produce illness;\u2022High numbers of viral particles are shed in the stools from infected persons (up to 1011 particles per gram stool reported for rotavirus);\u2022Viruses need specific living cells in order to replicate and therefore cannot do so in food or water; and\u2022Foodborne viruses typically are quite stable outside the host and are acid-resistant.\n",

In addition, the majority of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals is caused by NoV (Codex Alimentarius, 1999).

In much of the developing world, where HAV infection is endemic, the majority of persons are infected in early childhood and virtually all adults are immune. In these areas, HAV transmission is primarily from person to person. Outbreaks are rare because most infections occur among young children who generally remain asymptomatic. In the developed countries, however, HAV infections become less common as a result of increased standards of living. Very few persons are infected in early childhood, and the majority of adults remain susceptible to infection by HAV. Because virus shedding starts 10\u201314 days before the onset of symptoms, there is a clear window for spreading the virus. As a result, the risk of (large) outbreaks of HAV increases in these regions.",

Indeed, foodborne outbreaks have been reported in most parts of the world and can be large. For example in Shanghai, China, in 1988, 250,000 people had HAV after consumption of contaminated clams (Halliday et al., 1991). Detection of sporadic cases or small clusters of foodborne hepatitis A is problematic because the incubation period can be long. As a result, a possible association with food consumed weeks ago can rarely be investigated at the time of onset of illness. For NoV and HAV, waterborne outbreaks are unusual but have been reported.",

Recently, NoV was found in a large proportion of calf herds and in some pigs (van der Poel et al., 2000). The strains in animals were genetically distinct from any of the viruses found in people (Sugieda et al., 1998). No calf-to-human or pig-to-human transmission has been documented so far. The animal viruses, however, are quite similar to the human NoV and continue to change as all RNA viruses do. This implies that zoonotic transmission might occur if the right circumstances arise.",

This suggests that the risk of zoonotic transmission is rather low and currently of no practical consequence for food handling procedures.

            "text": "Infection with gastroenteritis viruses is usually diagnosed by the detection of the pathogen in stool samples from sick people, rather than by measuring the antibody response in serum Table 2, Table 3\n. Historically, viruses were diagnosed by scanning a stool suspension under an electron microscope (EM) (Atmar and Estes, 2001). This assay still remains the gold standard for virus diagnosis but is rather insensitive and labour-intensive (Table 2). Routine ELISA assays are available for detection of group A rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses, as well as for some of the NoV Table 2, Table 3. For non-group A rotaviruses, Sapoviruses (SaV), and the remaining NoVs, the diagnosis can be made by detection of viral nucleic acid using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. A problem with NoV is the variability of the viral genome, making it difficult to develop a single generic detection test. For the hepatitis viruses, detection of specific IgM antibodies is diagnostic of recent infection. In addition, viruses can be detected in stool and in serum by RT-PCR, but this is not done routinely. There are great differences in the detection limit of the different assays, ranging from a few particles (cell culture and RT-PCR) to a million particles per gram as minimum amounts necessary for a positive test (Table 2). This has direct consequences for the interpretation of results. A person with a positive EM test sheds a great number of viral particles, whereas a person with a positive RT-PCR may shed few particles. No clear guidelines are yet available on interpretation of these different test results, and little has been done to standardise tests. Complicating factors are that people who are ill do not necessarily shed more viruses than those who have no symptoms and that the maximum levels of shedding appear to be different for different viruses. Thus, at present, the diagnosis of viral infection is qualitative (yes/no) and does not provide additional information that may help in deciding whether the person presents an important risk factor for the food chain. On the other hand, because the minimum dose required for infection is very low for these viruses, any infected person may spread the disease.",

Because contamination is often caused by foodhandlers, the level of contamination with virus may vary greatly within a product. The combination of variable virus counts and the lack of a culture system is the main reason why virtually no information is available on the variability of test results from sampling or what would be considered representative samples for monitoring purposes. Furthermore, (molecular) diagnostic methods for food or water are not routinely available in food microbiology laboratories (Table 3). Most successful research has focussed on shellfish, but even with published standard protocols, little is known about the performance of such standards in \u201cthe field\u201d (e.g. if a batch of oysters does contain some contaminated ones, how likely is it that a virus test will give the right answer?).

In addition, no simple animal models are available for experimental studies of virus inactivation. Thus, detection methods currently rely on genome detection by molecular detection techniques such as RT-PCR. A positive signal indicates an intact segment of viral genomic RNA. This does not provide information on virus infectivity. Completely inactivated particles that pose no threat to public health may still contain intact RNA, thus resulting in a positive virus assay. The RNA will eventually be degraded, but it is unknown how long this will take in different environments. In shellfish, inactivation of the virus was followed by rapid degradation (<1 min) of viral RNA (Slomka and Appleton, 1998). In seawater, however, RNA persisted for days after inactivation of the virus.",

For HAV, a cell-culture-adapted variant has been used, for example in studies addressing heat resistance in different food items (Bidawid et al., 2000a). For NoV, structurally similar viruses are the enteroviruses, HAV, and astroviruses. These are all viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome and are approximately 7-kb long, approximately 30 nm in size, and similar in capsid structure (no envelope) (Fig. 1). Slomka and Appleton (1998) recommended the use of an animal calicivirus (FeCV) for inactivation studies and found that FeCV was clearly less stable than HAV. Because most infectivity and inactivation data are available for the enteroviruses and HAV, we have used these data for our risk estimates (Table 4)\n. It should be clear, however, that these remain estimates and will have to be evaluated carefully.",

It is clear from numerous outbreaks that the presence of \u201ctraditional\u201d bacterial indicators of faecal contamination does not consistently correlate with the presence of pathogenic viruses. Many groups have proposed the use of bacteriophages as indicators. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and replicate in bacteria. They are present in substantial numbers in human stool samples and, in some respects, are similar to viruses pathogenic to humans. Because of similarities in structure, behaviour, and stability, bacteriophages may be of use in assessing cumulative exposure to human faecal waste. However, care must be taken not to provide a false sense of safety by measuring the presence of bacteriophages only. The observed clear differences in stability of different human pathogenic viruses (described later in this document) that reside in the intestine illustrate that extrapolation of data from one virus to another cannot be relied upon (Slomka and Appleton, 1998). Similarly, the possible use of phages as surrogates in evaluating the antiviral effectiveness of processes needs to be carefully validated (Mariam and Cliver, 2000a).",

For example, rotaviruses in aerosols (generated while vomiting and thought to play a role in the transmission of those viruses) were found to survive in the air up to 9 days at 20 \u00b0C (Sattar et al., 1984). Viruses also may persist for extended periods (1\u201360 days for 100-fold reduction in infectivity) on several types of materials commonly found in institutions and domestic environments (e.g. paper, cotton cloth, aluminium, china, glazed tile, latex, and polystyrene; Abad et al., 1997) (Fig. 3)\n. Adenoviruses were found to survive for up to 35 days on a plastic surface in an environment with low relative humidity (Nauheim et al., 1990). This relation with humidity varies among viruses. A high relative humidity favours the survival of enteroviruses, whereas a low relative humidity favours survival of HAV and human rotavirus (HRV) Mbithi et al., 1991, Sattar et al., 1986, Sattar et al., 1988. Furthermore, HAV remained infectious in dried faeces for 30 days when stored at 25 \u00b0C and 42% relative humidity (Hollinger and Ticehurst, 1996). This stresses the need for virus-specific studies to address virus inactivation. Finally, in artificially contaminated water, viruses may survive for prolonged periods of time, with over 1-year survival of poliovirus and rotavirus in mineral water at 4 \u00b0C (Biziagos et al., 1988). Recent data published by Beuret et al. (2000) on traces of NoV RNA found in bottled water may tend to support this statement. However, as yet, no one has been able to confirm these data.",

Based on this information, an inactivation factor of at least 3 log10 during post-manual-treatment processes would be required. Based on these assumptions, we have tried to estimate the likelihood of survival of the most important foodborne viruses for commonly used food processing methods if foods are contaminated before processing. With the exception of ultrahigh temperature treatment, no methods would completely inactivate more than 3 log10 of virus, and we estimate that with foods contaminated after processing, viruses will remain active to a significant extent and thus pose a possible risk factor (Fig. 3, Table 4). Therefore, the emphasis should be strongly on prevention of contamination before or during processing by proper deployment of GHP, GMP, and HACCP. Clearly, the likelihood of virus contamination in primary products will differ for different commodities and is the highest for shellfish and manually handled fruits. For foods contaminated after processing, our estimate is that viruses will remain active in most foods (Kurdziel et al., 2001) (Fig. 3, Table 4).",

With viral infections (e.g. NoV) being very common, it is wise to assume that the introduction of viruses into the food chain is a likely event that needs to be prevented by stringent hygienic control. Foodhandlers in contact with people with gastroenteritis (e.g. young children) are at special risk of being contaminated and becoming a source of viruses during food manufacture operations. They must be made aware that specific personal hygiene must be ensured. Increasing the awareness of all foodhandlers about transmission of enteric viruses (including the spread of viruses by vomiting) is needed, with special emphasis on the risk of \u201csilent\u201d transmission by asymptomatically infected persons and via those who continue to shed virus after recovery from illness. At present, insufficient data are available to determine which steps will be critical for all foods in an HACCP system, but it is clear that at least the following points should be addressed:\u2022Water used in combination with the culturing or preparation of food should be of drinking water quality; and\u2022Guidelines specifically aimed at the reduction of viral contamination are needed, as it has become clear that current indicators for water and shellfish quality are insufficient as predictors of viral contamination.\n",

Such methods should be reasonably simple (as few steps as possible), efficient (in terms of recovery of viruses), and reproducible. The crucial (and most difficult to achieve) step is extraction of virus particles from the food matrix. Research should focus on this process.\u2022A standard method to assess virus survival would allow acquisition of comparative data (e.g. responses of different virus types to the same set of environmental conditions). The features of this method would include similar inoculum size, sample size, sampling time, and statistical analysis. A project to develop such a method and apply it in various environments would provide useful data.\u2022Efforts to find a cell culture system that will allow propagation of NoV are vital.

Foodborne viral infections are diagnosed with increasing frequency. This illustrates the existence of regular breaks in the microbial safety of food. Although the most common pathogens cause relatively mild, self-limiting illness, their high incidence illustrates the potential for large, international foodborne viral epidemics.
