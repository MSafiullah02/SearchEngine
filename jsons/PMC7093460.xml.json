            "text": "The detection of antigen-specific antibodies in human specimens via serology remains an essential and fundamental necessity in laboratory medicine and therapeutic and vaccine development. Antibody serology is used in the diagnosis of hundreds of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, and new biomarkers and tests continue to expand the utility of serology. Nevertheless, antibody serologic tests frequently exhibit suboptimal performance characteristics as measured by clinical sensitivity and specificity, require subjective interpretation1, and/or depend upon multi-step algorithms2,3. Serologic assays using whole cell material and antigen mixtures can have high false positive rates, leading to unnecessary follow-up tests, inappropriate treatments, or misdiagnosis of patients. Antibody serologic methods typically provide a narrow view of immunity towards a single, or small number of antigens or organisms, while an estimated 1400 pathogens may cause human disease4. And, many of these diseases lack effective serology tests altogether. Furthermore, many tests remain organism or antigen-based, even though knowledge of which antigen epitopes are targeted can be critical for inferring infection stage5, reactivation6, and immune protection7.",

            "text": "Despite biomedical need, methods have not emerged to broadly analyze antibody repertoire composition to enable multiplex serology for infection, allergy, or autoimmunity. Multiplex serology is typically limited to several organisms, and to only a small subset of their immunogenic epitopes8,9, even though infection or vaccination can give rise to hundreds of distinct antibody species10. To expand the breadth and information content of parallel immunoassays, pathogen-proteome derived phage display libraries and planar peptide arrays have been developed. For example, a phage display library of 93,904, 56-mer peptides spanning 208 human virus proteomes was constructed11,12. Following immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing, seropositivity towards each virus was inferred. However, comprehensive proteome tiling for many higher complexity organisms is currently impractical given their larger proteome size. Similarly, the tiling of overlapping peptides from sets of a priori known antigens from eight tick-borne pathogens enabled construction of a planar peptide arrays with 170,000 features enabling detection of each infection2. In principle, this method could be expanded to include a larger number of pathogens but requires known antigens or epitopes, and does not provide sufficient peptide diversity to mimic diverse structural epitopes. Random peptide arrays of up to 330,000 members have proven effective to detect antibodies towards a range of organisms (i.e., viral, bacterial, fungal)13. Yet, they lack the diversity required to effectively mimic arbitrary protein antigens, and thereby detect the corresponding antibodies. Thus, methods to analyze entire antibody repertoires to reveal the spectrum of antigenic epitopes are needed.",

Chagas disease is estimated to impact more than 300,000 people in the United States and 8 million in Central and South America16. Confirmatory testing currently requires the use of three serology tests - two parallel, independent tests, and a third \u201ctie-breaker\u201d test to achieve a specificity of >99%. Thus, a single test with high specificity could streamline confirmatory testing and screening in blood donors and at-risk groups17. Our results indicate that NGS-based serology using SERA provides an effective approach to antigen and epitope discovery, and an assay format capable of achieving exceptional diagnostic specificity without multiplexing limitations.",

We then down-selected the full set of IMUNE output motifs by requiring a retained motif to be (i) significantly enriched (\u22654 standard deviations from mean of the controls) in at least 15% of Chagas specimens (n = 28) and (ii) absent from control repertoires (i.e., non-significantly enriched (<4 standard deviations from mean of controls) in 99% of control epitope repertoires (n = 200). Downselection yielded 194 motifs with sensitivities ranging from 18\u201380% (Supplementary Table S2). IMUNE identified overlapping groups of motifs that mapped to the same T. cruzi epitopes and occurred in the same subsets of epitope repertoires. For example, [FW]KPWE and EGxKxWE shared three identities, and both occurred within a metacaspase 7-mer epitope EGFKPWE. Motifs mapping to the same epitope were grouped and their equivalence was confirmed by clustering of motif seropositivity (Supplementary Table S3). Thus, IMUNE yielded more than 100 Chagas disease specific motifs (>99% specificity) with varying sensitivity (Fig. 2a). Individual motifs were remarkably specific to Chagas disease, as determined by inspection of their corresponding Enrichment values (# observations/# expected) within the discovery set of 200 epitope repertoires (Fig. 2b).",

The set contained 12 Leishmania seropositive specimens, known to cause false positives in Chagas serology tests19, due to the relatedness of these organisms. Even so, the panel accurately classified all 30 Chagas as positive, as well as 30 non-Chagas controls and 11/12 Leishmania as negative (Fig. 4a,b). A second Leishmania seropositive epitope repertoire was similarly elevated on Chagas panel v1.0 but classified as negative (Fig. 4b). Inspection of the Leishmania motif enrichments revealed that the motif [ADP]GGFG was enriched in these two Leishmania specimens (Fig. 4a), and present in the proteomes of both T. cruzi and Leishmania. Removal of this motif from the panel, yielded Chagas panel v1.1 which resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 100% within the first validation set (Fig. 4c).",

Within Chagas disease sera, many conserved epitopes were identified as sequence motifs representing the shared amino acid preferences within established and putative candidate Trypanosoma cruzi antigens. Measurement of motif enrichments within the set of all Ig-binding peptides for a given specimen (the epitope repertoire) provided a quantitative measure of epitope-specific Ig binding activity that could be multiplexed as desired to detect any number of epitope-specific antibodies. A random peptide library of 10 billion 12-mers provided sufficient diversity to represent all possible 6 amino acid motifs with 99% confidence, and all possible 7-mers with 98% confidence. This diversity is thus about 10,000\u2013100,000-fold greater than that represented by pathogen proteome peptide arrays (e.g., representing a specific pathogen)11 or random peptide arrays13. SERA differs from reported phage display library immunoprecipitation (PhIP) or VirScan11 approaches to antibody repertoire profiling, in that it makes no assumptions about which organisms, strains, or specific epitopes may be targeted by antibodies. Consequently, SERA provides a universal approach that can be applied to analyze the immune response to virtually any biological organism or protein antigen - including pathogens, commensals, allergens, biologics and autoantigens.",

Transfusions from asymptomatic, infected donors may transmit the parasite to blood recipients. Consequently, serologic testing for Chagas disease is included in routine blood bank testing of donors. For confirmatory testing and screening, no single serological test achieves adequate specificity, necessitating the use of two or three independent serology tests. Using Chagas disease seropositive specimens, a panel of 31 peptide motifs was identified that exhibited 100% sensitivity (60/60) and 100% specificity (120/120) in independent validation sets. Remarkably, the Chagas SERA assay exhibited 99.8% specificity (998/1000) amongst sera without known Chagas serostatus, which compares favorably to the combined sensitivity and specificity of individual, FDA-cleared tests17. The exceptional specificity of SERA could be expected to yield fewer false positive tests, a feature that may be useful in screening and surveillance studies21, particularly when multiple tests are performed in parallel.",

However, the 28 specimens used for discovery were from subjects who had lived or travelled in multiple countries where different DTUs are prevalent including Bolivia, Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Argentina22 (Supplementary Table S1). We were able to identify a set of epitope motifs that were conserved among these subjects, and independently validated with a sensitivity of 100% in a randomized, blinded set, demonstrating that the discovered motifs effectively captured the diversity in T. cruzi DTUs among the tested population. Nevertheless, our discovery and validation specimens may not represent all DTUs, and thus, expanded validation amongst a larger cohort with known DTU may reveal whether all DTUs are detected with equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we do not know whether these individuals were in the acute or chronic phase of infection.

Second, computational discovery using epitope repertoires from other infectious diseases enabled optimization of motif combinations to minimize cross-reactivity in non-Chagas sera. We discovered the motif [ADP]GGFG to be enriched in the epitope repertoires from specimens seropositive for either T. cruzi or Leishmania sp., (an organism known to generate false positive Chagas test results23).

Strain level variation, a recurrent problem in infectious disease diagnostics24, can be accommodated using motifs constructed from peptides enriched from a random library.

Longer term, commercial testing labs, and state and federal labs could develop Laboratory-Developed Tests (LDTs) within their existing CLIA labs using peptide library reagent plates, and published motifs and methods. In the authors\u2019 facilities, the assay is routinely performed in 96-well plates, using semi-automated commercial liquid-handling instrumentation, with a two day turn-around time. Finally, the bacterial display peptide library used here could be manufactured economically by conventional fed-batch fermentation, and quality control of the library reagent can be performed using NGS to measure the composition/diversity.

Filtering removed sequences greater than or less than lengths of 36 bases, sequences with four or more mis-matches or base pair insertions in the regions flanking the peptide region, or sequences with in-frame stop codons. Trimming removed the flanking sequences so that only the library peptide encoding sequences remained. (2) The DNA sequences were translated into peptide sequences of 12 amino acids. (3) Peptide sequences were collapsed into a single sequence if they had nine or more shared identities. Processing thus yielded a unique peptide list (each with a count of one) for each specimen representing an antibody epitope repertoire.",

IMUNE identified patterns, defined as three to five amino acids interspersed with undefined residues (\u201cX\u201d) within a 10-amino acid window, that were significantly (Poisson p < 0.0001) enriched in 25% of Chagas samples but not enriched in any discovery control samples (100% specificity). Pattern enrichment was quantified as the ratio of pattern observations in a sample to the expected observations taking into account the amino acid frequencies in the peptide library and total number of sequences for that sample as described15. Pattern enrichment significance was evaluated via two statistics: Poisson and standard deviation. The Poisson statistic selected patterns if they were statistically enriched (p < 0.0001) in disease repertoires but not enriched in controls. The standard deviation method identified patterns enriched in disease repertoires relative to those of controls. For the standard deviation method, patterns could be present or enriched in controls but were enriched by >3\u20134 standard deviations above the controls in disease data sets. Significantly enriched patterns were aligned and scored using a PAM30 substitution matrix and IMUNE15, to generate motifs that could include positions where multiple amino acids are observed, indicated by brackets (e.g., [IVL] or [KRQ]. Pattern clustering with IMUNE generated 331 motifs (Supplementary Table S2). To identify the most sensitive and specific motifs for inclusion into a Chagas diagnostic panel, motif enrichment values were standardized using,\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${z}_{i}=\\frac{x-\\mu }{\\sigma }$$\\end{document}zi=x\u2212\u03bc\u03c3where zi is the z-score of motif i, x is the motif enrichment within a repertoire, \u03bc = average enrichment of control cohort, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation for motif i in the control cohort.
