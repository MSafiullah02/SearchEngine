This chapter will review the common respiratory viral agents in infants and young children, including epidemiology and clinical and radiographic features. The role of the laboratory in diagnosis is emphasized with respect to rapid diagnostic techniques and histopathologic features in tissue sections. A brief summary of each of the major infantile respiratory viruses is provided, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus, as well as the more recently detected and increasingly significant lower respiratory tract viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus. Congenital and neonatal forms of viral pneumonia, such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and measles virus, are also discussed. Postinfectious complications of viral bronchiolitis are included in this chapter due to the significant persistent morbidity during infancy in many patients.",

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a leading indication for hospitalization (2\u20133 %) in young children.

RSV remains the most prevalent and most severe of the neonatal LRTI\u2019s (Coffin 2005; Hammond et al. 2007; Chong et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2009; Fitzgerald 2011). Studies indicate that 20\u201367 % of children less than 1 year of age will be infected by RSV, with infection rates up to 95 % by age 2 years (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010; Hammond et al. 2007; Fitzgerald 2011; Johnson et al. 2007). PIV commonly occurs within the first 6 months of life with 50 % of patients affected by the first year of life (Hammond et al. 2007). Recently updated diagnostic technologies, including multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, have offered more accurate and faster diagnostic methods allowing appropriate treatments and patient management. Importantly, PCR for DNA viruses and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for RNA viruses also have allowed identification of viruses which are difficult to culture, such as hMPV and BoV, allowing better delineation of multi-agent respiratory viral infections (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010). The most common synchronously occurring respiratory viruses are RSV and RhV (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010; Chong et al. 2009; Garcia et al. 2010). In the last decade, hMPV, BoV, CoV, and RhV are increasingly recognized as causes of lower respiratory viral infections in children (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010). Together, hMPV and BoV account for approximately 13 % of previously undiagnosable acute respiratory infections (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010). Relative incidence and mean age at diagnosis for infantile respiratory viral infections in the United States are summarized in Table 17.1.\n",

In particular, the highest risk of mortality is associated with respiratory viral infection in premature neonates less than 1,500 g birth weight, with a reported mortality rate of 30 per 100,000 live births (Coffin 2005). The mechanisms for increased susceptibility in this population include inadequate immunologic defenses against infection, possibly due to a lack of immune experience and diminished transfer or maternal antibodies in utero, incomplete development of the neonatal airways and chest musculature, and decreased cardiopulmonary reserve due to chronic lung disease (Hammond et al. 2007; Welliver 2003; Papenburg and Boivin 2010). Chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease are both predictors of prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality due to viral bronchiolitis (Papenburg and Boivin 2010). Epidemiologic data suggests that American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a disproportionately higher mortality rate and hospitalization rate due to bronchiolitis, compared to both African Americans and Caucasians (Chang et al. 2009; Singleton et al. 2009). This higher risk in Native Americans may be due to genetic factors or due to higher prevalence of known maternal risk factors including diabetes, alcohol and tobacco usage, and delayed or absent prenatal care (Chang et al. 2009; Singleton et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Common clinical signs and symptoms in pediatric LRTIs include coryza, apnea, rapid shallow breaths, head bobbing, tracheal tug, chest wall hyperinflation, and intercostal retractions (Fitzgerald 2011). In addition to small airway inflammation, peripheral hyperinflation within the lung parenchyma contributes to symptoms (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010). Severe symptoms are commonly characterized by oxygen saturation less than 92\u201393 % (Hammond et al. 2007; Chang et al. 2009; Fitzgerald 2011; Thomson and Harris 2011). Atypical clinical presentations of viruses can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial etiologies. Typically, chest radiographs demonstrate diffuse airspace shadowing and/or dispersed areas of consolidation in bacterial pneumonia, whereas viral pneumonias more often produce hyperinflated lung parenchyma with patchy infiltrates and peribronchial cuffing (Fig. 17.1) (Coffin 2005; Chong et al. 2009). However there has been much debate about the reproducibility in the radiographic diagnosis of pneumonias, with a 48 % concordance with the WHO radiographic classification and relatively poor clinical utility in distinguishing bacterial versus viral etiologies (Thomson and Harris 2011). One study suggests that a specific infectious agent is not identified in more than 50 % of LRTIs, leaving clinicians to empirically treat with antibiotics, a potentially unnecessary drug exposure with increased risk of developing drug resistance in bacteria (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010; Marcos et al. 2009).\n\n",

            "text": "Accurate diagnosis and confirmation of a viral etiology are helpful in effectively managing LRTI symptoms. Noninvasive methods of diagnosis include nasal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Nasopharyngeal aspirate has been found to be the most sensitive and specific method, superior to nasal swab, and is the preferred method for initial diagnosis at the point of care (Macfarlane et al. 2005). The nasopharyngeal aspirate can be analyzed by direct immunofluorescence (IF) study, enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), RT-PCR, and viral culture (Coffin 2005; Fitzgerald 2011; Marcos et al. 2009). Culture has previously been regarded as the gold standard; however, the availability of PCR has proven this method to be more sensitive and specific with significantly faster processing times (Marcos et al. 2009; Mathisen et al. 2009). Multiplex PCR assays have also proven very useful in LRTI diagnosis due to simultaneous detection of multiple viral agents, ability to determine viral load, and same day results in a single test (Marcos et al. 2009). IF and EIA tests have lower sensitivity (60\u201397 %) compared to PCR techniques but are even more rapid. The simplicity of commercially available EIA kits allows their application at the bedside, yielding results within 10 min, a particularly helpful tool in peak season epidemics (Papenburg and Boivin 2010). Tissue diagnosis of respiratory viral infection is also possible via cytomorphology and immunohistochemistry (IHC); however, this requires invasive procedures, an infrequent diagnostic first step. Antibodies to viral antigens are commercially available for immunohistochemistry for most of the neonatal and infantile respiratory viruses, including RSV, PIV, hMPV, InfV, AdV, HSV, and measles virus (Hammond et al. 2007). PCR diagnosis also has been applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues (Akhtar et al. 1996). Table 17.2 compares the various diagnostic methods and their utility.\n",

Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is recognized by the presence of a circumferential cuff of airway-centered lymphocytes and macrophages, in some cases associated with secondary epithelial necrosis and sloughing, and plugging of bronchioles by fibrin and mucus. Squamous metaplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium and surrounding airspaces may be prominent in the healing phase of injury. Interstitial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates (pneumonitis) may be present, despite the fact that direct viral infection of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes is only variably demonstrated (Coffin 2005; Hammond et al. 2007; Welliver 2003). Specific viral cytopathic effect is typically recognizable in congenital HSV and AdV infections, but viral cytopathic effect is rare or absent in most other respiratory viral infections in infants, including RSV, hMPV, PIV, and InfV. In contrast to otherwise healthy children, immunosuppressed neonates and infants (e.g., patients with bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or primary immunodeficiencies) typically have less inflammatory response and a more florid viral cytopathic effect, similar to that seen in pure culture media. Multinucleated syncytial giant cells with cytoplasmic inclusions should suggest a diagnosis of RSV, hMPV, or PIV, and immunohistochemistry or molecular testing on the tissue would be necessary for confirmation of diagnosis, if the virus has not been detected previously.",

            "text": "RSV infection is the most common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children, and seroprevalence approaches 100 % of the population by 2 years of age (Papenburg and Boivin 2010). The peak incidence is from 6 weeks to 6 months of age (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010). Clinically, RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract causes coryza, cough, hoarseness, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. Acute otitis media is a frequent complication. Lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV results in a syndrome of bronchiolitis (65 %) or pneumonia (21 %) and less commonly croup (11 %) or asthma exacerbation (3 %) (Williams et al. 2004). Vomiting is seen in a significant percentage of children (31 %). Hospitalization is required in 1\u20132 % of infected infants and mortality is relatively rare (0.02 %) but accounts for approximately 500 deaths annually in the United States (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010; Hammond et al. 2007). The histopathologic findings in RSV infection include circumferential inflammation of bronchiolar mucosa and infection of type 1 and 2 pneumocytes (Fig. 17.2) (Johnson et al. 2007). The inflammatory infiltrate consists of bronchocentric mucosal and transmural mononuclear cells (primarily T lymphocytes and monocytes) and neutrophils. Neutrophilic infiltration centers on the bronchioles, whereas mononuclear infiltration affects both bronchioles and parenchyma. As with other viruses, airway obstruction results from epithelial and inflammatory cell debris mixed with fibrin, mucus, and edema, compounded by extrinsic compression of bronchioles by hyperplastic lymphoid follicles (Johnson et al. 2007). Syncytial giant cell formation is rare in immunocompetent children but characteristic of the histopathologic features in immunocompromised patients (Fig. 17.3) (Coffin 2005; Hammond et al. 2007; Welliver 2003). Therapy for RSV includes use of ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside analogue. High-risk populations of children may also be preventatively treated with palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the F protein of RSV (Papenburg and Boivin 2010).\n\n\n",

There are four serotypes of parainfluenza virus: PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and PIV4. PIV1 and PIV2 are seasonal with highest prevalence in the fall months in the United States, whereas PIV3 occurs year-round with peak in the late spring and summer. PIV3 bronchiolitis and pneumonia are typically seen in young infants, less than 6 months of age, whereas PIV1 and PIV2 more often cause upper respiratory tract disease in toddlers and young children (2\u20135 years of age). PIV4 is often asymptomatic and infrequently detected. Mortality for PIV is quite low, except for overwhelming infection in immunocompromised patients. Histopathologic features in the general population are not well described, but animal models of PIV infection demonstrate infection of the bronchiolar epithelium, bronchiolitis, and pneumonitis (Hammond et al. 2007). Histologically, PIV produces a giant cell pneumonitis and occasional cytoplasmic inclusions in the immunocompromised host, histologically indistinguishable from RSV or metapneumovirus infection (Fig. 17.4).\n\n",

In contrast to hMPV, asthma exacerbation is not a typical feature of InfV infection. InfV occurs in individuals across a broad age range during periods of regional epidemics or occasionally as part of a major global pandemic, as in the influenza outbreaks of 1918, 1957, and 1968. The peak incidence is in the winter months in the United States and may induce severe disease in young infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised populations. The virus primarily infects the bronchial and bronchiolar respiratory epithelium, but occasional alveolar epithelial cells can also be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Classically, InfV infection produces a necrotizing bronchiolitis, peribronchiolar infiltrates, interstitial inflammation, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membranes (diffuse alveolar damage) (Fig. 17.5). Secondary bacterial pneumonia is common in fatal cases (47 %) (Bhat et al. 2005; Guarner et al. 2006). There are currently four antivirals effective against InfV infection: amantidine, rimantadine, anamivir, and oseltamivir. Vaccination is recommended for infants greater than 6 months old and for pregnant women for protection of their neonates in the first 6 months of life by passive immunity.\n\n",

The true role of BoV as a causative agent of respiratory infection has been controversial due to high rates of viral coinfection (Milder and Arnold 2009). hMPV and/or BoV are identified in about half of viral coinfections in children (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010). Nevertheless, most available studies with controls have shown few or no asymptomatic patients detected with BoV, lending credence that BoV is a true pathogen in children (Brieu et al. 2008). Similar to other pediatric respiratory viral infections, symptoms of BoV include fever, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and wheezing. Furthermore, BoV has been identified in some patients with gastroenteritis (1\u20139 %) and as a potential cause of Kawasaki disease (31 %) (Brodzinski and Ruddy 2009). Peak incidence of BoV is in the winter months, similar to RSV and hMPV. Laboratory diagnosis can be made by EIA method or PCR technology. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, and there are no available medical therapies at this time.",

Severe RSV bronchiolitis is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in the short term (Papenburg and Boivin 2010). Some suggest that greater severity of RSV bronchiolitis may reflect an intrinsic genetic predisposition for asthma. hMPV is detected in approximately 8\u20139 % of children with recurrent wheezing and BoV in approximately 5\u20136 % (Smuts et al. 2008). Specifically, hMPV bronchiolitis carries a fivefold risk of future development of asthma compared to control patients hospitalized for gastroenteritis (Brodzinski and Ruddy 2009).",

Obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis may follow any form of necrotizing bronchiolitis but is most often reported as a sequela of AdV infections (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010; Coffin 2005; Hammond et al. 2007; Chong et al. 2009; Garcia et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2009). Clinically, postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is characterized by obstructive pulmonary function tests and chest CT evidence of bronchiectasis and regional air trapping (\u201cmosaic perfusion\u201d) best seen on expiratory images. Histologically, obliterative bronchiolitis is characterized by fibrous obliteration or constriction of small airways by subepithelial fibrosis (Fig. 17.7). This finding may be subtle and subject to sampling error on wedge lung biopsy, and connective tissue stains such as trichrome or Movat pentachrome are helpful in eliciting the fibrotic airways within bronchovascular bundles.\n\n",

Neonates and infants are predisposed to RSV, hMPV, and PIV, in contrast to RhV, CoV, and InfV, the most common lower respiratory tract viruses in adults. Premature infants are particularly susceptible to these viral infections and carry a higher morbidity and mortality relative to the adult population. Laboratory diagnosis by viral culture, EIA, IF, and multiplex PCR assays are the mainstays of specific diagnosis in infancy, similar to older children and adults. Despite the increasingly recognized prevalence of culture-negative respiratory viruses such as hMPV, BoV, and CoV, RSV remains a central pathogen in respiratory infections in infants and tends to be more severe than these other viruses. Pathologic features in lung biopsy or autopsy vary dependent on the immunologic status of the patient. Immunocompromised infants have more pronounced viral cytopathic effect (giant cells and/or viral inclusions) and relatively little inflammatory response, whereas otherwise healthy infants more often have lymphocytic bronchiolitis or pneumonitis without distinguishing viral cytopathic effect. Immunohistochemistry may be used for confirmation of diagnosis in tissues; however, the more cost-effective and comprehensive method for confirmation of diagnosis currently is the use of molecular diagnostic techniques.",
