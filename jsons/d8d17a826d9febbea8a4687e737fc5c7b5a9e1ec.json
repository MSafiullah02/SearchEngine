            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to many countries asking or requiring their citizens to stay home to avoid potentially contacting the disease or exposing others to the disease. Older patients with comorbidities are at particular risk of developing severe infection with COVID-19. Many people on anticoagulation are older and have significant comorbities. 1 In many countries, including Turkey, governments have imposed restrictions on travel from home to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although so-called \"sheltering in place\" is proving to be an effective way to decrease community transmission, patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, like warfarin, may be harmed by such policies. Routine reporting of patients to outpatient clinics of hospitals or laboratories for checking their international normalized ratio (INR) places them at risk for community-acquired infection from COVID-19, whereas not traveling for INR checks places them at risk for a complication of over-or under-anticoagulation as INR levels can be labile in many patients on VKAs.",

Although there are no definite recommendations about anticoagulation after venous stenting, many patients are receiving VKAs.",
