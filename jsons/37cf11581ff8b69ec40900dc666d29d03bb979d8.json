We periodically monitored data collection and determined the inter-observer agreement on the primary outcome on a randomly selected sample of 20 study patients.

In addition, due to limited sensitivity, many patients who tested negative for SARS-C0V-2 may have had COVID-19. Importantly, our predictive models are based on the initial presentation to the ED. Obviously, changes in vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging over time are critical in predicting outcomes.

Thus, for every 100 PUI admitted to the hospital, 9 will require immediate ICU and/or IMV and another 12 will require ICU and/or IMV within approximately 2-3 days. When intubated, the length of mechanical ventilation is considerable, further contributing to the healthcare burden. As expected, lower oxygen saturations and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were both associated with need for ICU, IMV, and mortality. Male sex and respiratory rate were associated with ICU admission while a history of COPD, and age were associated with mortality. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have a known exposure to COVID-19, cough, fever, be Hispanic, have a smoking history, and be hypoxemic.
