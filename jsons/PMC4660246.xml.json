            "text": "Each year, approximately 1 in 9 infants in the United States, more than 440,000 infants yearly, are born prematurely (<37 weeks gestation).1 These infants suffer from complications of exposure to a diverse environment at a time in development when the respiratory tract and immune system are intended to be protected and maintained in a relatively na\u00efve intrauterine state. During infancy and early childhood, premature infants suffer significant inflammatory and infectious respiratory morbidities with extended negative consequences for health, quality of life, and health care costs. As compared with approximately 8% of full-term newborns, 17% of late-preterm (LPT, born at 34 0/7\u201336 6/7 weeks) and 30% to 40% of early preterm infants (EPT, born at <32 weeks) are rehospitalized within the first year of life, most commonly for viral respiratory infections.2, 3, 4 Respiratory infections that are less severe, not requiring hospitalization, are even more common, recurrent and, in total, costly in the very young.5 The incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections in infants younger than 1 year is attributed at least in part to immune immaturity, a problem magnified by preterm birth and influenced by genetic traits and environmental exposures. Differences in gastrointestinal tract colonization patterns and the development and balance of the intestinal microbiome have been shown to influence immunologic development in full-term infants, and have begun to be evaluated in the premature.6, 7, 8 Viral infections, either subclinical or severe, may also alter immunologic development both directly and by altering the bacterial microflora. Preterm infants are exposed to maternal and hospital-based flora, frequently with additional pressures of antibiotics, indwelling catheters, and tubes, that alter the establishment of diverse, health-promoting microbiota on the skin and respiratory mucosa, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract, and increase the risk of invasive disease with predominant organisms.",

            "text": "Recurrence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life correlates inversely with gestational age at birth, directly with in utero exposure to inflammation (chorioamnionitis), and with non-white race. The pathogenesis of chronic lung disease of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), has been recently reviewed and is closely correlated with in utero inflammation, oxygen toxicity, ventilator-induced trauma, and prealveolar lung development at birth (Fig. 1\n).9, 10, 11 Premature birth induces a slowing or arrest of lung development that underlies BPD and likely occurs in a spectrum of severity in all prematurely born infants. Perinatal therapeutic and environmental exposures, most notably oxygen exposure and environmental tobacco smoke, have been reproducibly related to chronic respiratory morbidity, independent of mechanical ventilation and the diagnosis of BPD. A recent study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants without BPD demonstrated significant relationships between an integrated estimate of oxygen exposure in the first 3 to 14 days of life and symptomatic respiratory disease (SRD) over the first year of life.12 Lower gestational age, non-white race, greater oxygen exposure, and chorioamnionitis significantly increased the odds ratio of infants having SRD. A recent murine model demonstrated that early neonatal exposure to hyperoxia dramatically increases, in a dose-responsive manner, the severity of influenza infection when induced in adulthood, with markedly enhanced inflammation and fibrotic repair.9, 10 These observations, and an increasing understanding of the preterm infant immune system, as well as their exposures, colonization, and infections with microorganisms, suggest that interventions to modify the immunologic response may significantly improve respiratory and general outcome for these children. This article reviews prenatal and postnatal exposures that induce lung inflammation in preterm infants in the context of unique susceptibility factors that occur because of premature delivery.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the inflammatory response of the fetal or premature lung to injury or infection, if not causative of disease, exacerbates the severity of chronic lung disease in infants at risk.11, 13 Recent reviews highlight the current understanding of the role of inflammatory mediators and the immunobiology of BPD.14, 15, 16 Increased levels of proinflammatory mediators in amniotic fluid,17, 18 early tracheal effluents,19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 lung tissue,23 and serum25, 26 of at-risk premature infants support a role for both intrauterine and extrauterine inflammation in the development and severity of BPD. Airway and bronchoalveolar lavage samples demonstrate increased inflammatory cells and multiple proinflammatory mediators in ventilated, oxygen-exposed infants progressing toward BPD.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Genome-wide expression profiling of BPD lungs, as compared with gestational age\u2013matched controls, identified 159 differentially expressed genes.27 Pathway analysis identified cell cycle, immunodeficiency signaling, and B-cell development pathways associated with BPD. In addition, of the top 25 differentially expressed gene sets, 9 were related to chymase-expressing mast cells, the presence of which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Consistent with active inflammation, the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, a prototypical regulator of inflammation and cell survival, was elevated in neutrophils and macrophages in preterm infant airways, correlating with the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.28 Interestingly, NF-\u03baB activation in fetal lung and fetal lung macrophages has been shown to inhibit airway morphogenesis and activity of fibroblast growth factor 10, a critical factor in lung development, linking inflammation to the growth arrest of the preterm lung.29, 30 Several animal models demonstrate that mediators of inflammation, including endotoxins, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and transforming growth factor \u03b1, enhance lung maturation but also impair alveolar septation and vascular remodeling, and thus contribute to the development of BPD even without frank tissue destruction.31, 32, 33\n",

A recent study, using amniocentesis to sample amniotic fluid of 46 mothers with signs and symptoms of clinical chorioamnionitis, detected microorganisms by culture and/or PCR/mass spectrometry, frequently more than one microbe, in 61%.41 Fifteen percent had neither inflammation nor infection and 24% had amniotic fluid evidence of inflammation without detectable microorganisms, suggesting other noninfectious causes of clinical symptoms. Of those with clinical chorioamnionitis, 51% to 62% also have histologic evidence of placental inflammation.41, 42 Severity of acute histologic chorioamnionitis has been correlated with amniotic fluid matrix-metalloproteinase-8 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels supporting the presence of active inflammation.43, 44 It is not uncommon, however, to have evidence of acute histologic chorioamnionitis without detectable microorganisms, ranging from 30% to more than 50%. The cause of \u201csterile inflammation\u201d of the fetal-placental tissues may be noninfectious disease or lack of sensitivity for microbial detection. Inflammatory placental lesions of a more chronic form, characterized by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, sometimes eosinophils, also occur in association with preterm birth and recurrent placental failure. Most frequently, these lesions are of unknown etiology.45\n",

            "text": "Human CMV, a Betaherpesvirinae virus, latent in leukocytes, is highly prevalent in the human population; approximately 50% of adults are CMV seropositive and 60% of mothers of preterm infants. Congenital, in utero, infection of the fetus occurs in 0.1% to 2.0% of all pregnancies and may arise through primary infection of the mother, reactivation during pregnancy of a latent infection or reinfection with a different strain of CMV. Postnatal, the virus is spread even more efficiently from mother to the newborn via breastmilk. Because it reactivates in 95% or more of CMV-seropositive women in the postpartum period and can be detected in breastmilk as early as 3.5 days after delivery, CMV is a relatively common viral infection of the newborn period.88 Transmission to full-term newborns is reported in approximately 40%, whereas in preterm infants it varies from 6% to 55%, potentially due to differing strains, use of fresh/frozen milk, and maternal factors affecting viral shedding.88 A surveillance study of 175 NICU neonates, testing serum CMV-titers and CMV-DNA, demonstrated an overall prevalence of CMV of 12.6%. Ten (5.71%) of the infants had congenital infection, whereas 12 cases (6.86%) had perinatal infection.89 Postnatal infection in the newborn can be detected by molecular diagnostics as early as 12 days of life. Infection remains clinically silent in most, but 9% to 12% of postnatally infected low birth weight preterm infants have been reported to demonstrate severe, sepsislike infection.90 Although infants at lower gestational age are at increased risk of developing symptoms with postnatal infection and are also at greatest risk of BPD, there remains relatively little evidence of cause and effect. Prosch and colleagues91 found approximately 29% of VLBW infants with BPD to be CMV positive, but 12% of those without BPD. This study and others have found postnatal infection symptoms in preterms to be transient and to have no effect on neonatal outcome including BPD or necrotizing enterocolitis.92, 93 A review of PubMed articles describing CMV pneumonitis, however, concludes that CMV infection can be protracted with diffuse interstitial pneumonitis associated with fibrosis and BPD.94 It would appear that more surveillance and outcome studies are needed to determine if a causative relationship exists and if anti-CMV therapy or methods to reduce transmission of CMV to the fetus and neonates could effectively reduce disease.",

In premature infants born at less than 32 weeks\u2019 gestation, with and without BPD, those with a history of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were found to have more days of cough and wheeze at 1 year of age than those without RSV LRTI.104 Additionally, those with RSV LRTI and hMPV LRTI were found to have increased airway resistance at 1 year of age on pulmonary function testing.102 In some infants, airway function has been shown to deteriorate during the first years of life.105 When the group with BPD was followed up at school entry, those who had been hospitalized with RSV LRTI or another respiratory illness within the first 2 years of life had a greater cumulative number of outpatient visits and costs of care compared with former premature infants with BPD without a respiratory hospitalization.106 A subset of these children with pulmonary function testing at 8 to 10 years of age demonstrated significantly reduced lung function (lower forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s [FEV0.75], FEV0.75/forced vital capacity, and flows at 50% and 75% of vital capacity) in those with an RSV LRTI compared with children without. Whether viral LRTIs cause subsequent airway disease or are merely markers for preexisting abnormal lung function has not been definitively determined.101 The role of atopy, predisposition to asthma, and postinfection airway remodeling in relationship to LRTI and subsequent wheezing in childhood is also not clear.101, 107 A combination of viral factors and innate and adaptive immune responses, in the setting of a susceptible genetic background and a young or elderly host appear to drive clinical outcome.108, 109 An ongoing study of premature infants and viral LRTIs, including baseline pulmonary function testing, seeks to determine if the viral respiratory infection is causal of the increased long-term morbidity or merely a marker for children with more severe preexisting lung disease, as has been suggested for term infants (ClinicalTrials.gov\nNCT01789268). This question is important when evaluating selective vaccine strategies to prevent severe LRTI and chronic disease.",

IFN-\u03b3 and, particularly, TNF-\u03b1 are thought to be primary perpetrators of T-cell\u2013mediated lung injury, yet are also important for antimicrobial defense.130\n",

The total circulating white cell counts increase through the latter half of gestation until term delivery and then decrease slightly to adult levels. The percentage of lymphocytes decreases from approximately 80% at 18 to 36 weeks (median 26 weeks) to 40% at term delivery to 21% in the adult human, based on cord blood sampling at delivery or cordocentesis.133, 134 The proportion of CD3+ cells, however, increases with gestational age and in the presence of an infection. In normal pregnancies, circulating CD4+ T-cell numbers are inversely related to gestational age and the fetal percentage of CD8+ T cells was reduced, increasing before term (9.5%\u201315.7%) such that CD4+/CD8+ ratios also vary inversely with gestational age, higher in VLBW infants than full-term.135, 136 Maternal disease may alter fetal lymphocytes. Preeclampsia had a significant effect on T-cell distribution associating with fewer CD4+ cells and CD4+CD8+ double-positive cells, decreased CD4+/CD8+ ratios, reduced Th2 and regulatory T-cell subsets in cord blood, whereas maternal betamethasone therapy also associates with higher CD3+ cell proportion and a lower proportion of NK cells.137, 138\n",

More activated T cells in those who go on to develop BPD may reflect sequestration and activation of cells within the lung.142, 143 CD4+ T-cell percentage continued to decrease with postnatal age. Berrington and colleagues144 measured lymphocyte subclasses in premature infants just before first immunizations. At 7 to 8 weeks of age, prematurely born infants had lower absolute lymphocyte, T-cell, B-cell, and T-helper cell counts, and lower CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, than term infants, as well as increased proportion of T-regulatory (Treg) (CD4+CD25+) cells and decreased CD45RA + na\u00efve cells.

            "text": "The degree of lung and immune system maturation at the time of infection influences cytopathogenic responses to virus and perhaps bacteria but also appears to set a trajectory of immune response to subsequent challenge. Newborn mice infected with RSV have, compared with mice infected at a slightly later age, increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid numbers of Th2 type CD4+IL-4+ cells and fewer CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ cells when reinfected in adulthood.152 Likewise, mice infected with influenza A within 1 week of birth showed enhanced airway hyperreactivity, chronic pulmonary inflammation, and diffuse emphysematous-type lesions as adults. An adaptive immune insufficiency was most apparent in the neonatal CD8+ T cells. Newborn infection was associated with reduced and delayed IFN-\u03b3 responses as compared with infection in older animals. RSV-infected neonatal mice recruited CD8+ T cells defective in IFN-\u03b3 production in association with mild symptoms. Reinfection as adults, however, resulted in limited viral replication but enhanced inflammation and T-cell recruitment, including Th2 cells and eosinophils.153, 154 Depletion of CD8+ T cells (but not CD4) cells during the primary neonatal infection was protective against the adult challenge. Recall responses from neonatal-primed and adult-primed mice were associated with IFN-\u03b3 secretion, indicative of a Th1 response. However, IL-4 and IL-5 secretion were enhanced only in neonatal-primed mice. Rechallenge of these mice, primed as newborns, was also associated with increased concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), and RANTES in the lung. It is suggested then that neonatal T cells, in particular IFN-\u03b3\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells, play a crucial role in regulation of immune responses after neonatal infection. In these neonatal animal models, adoptive transfer of naive CD8+ cells, from wild-type but not from IFN-\u03b3\u2013deficient donors, significantly lowered pulmonary viral titers and greatly improved pulmonary function as adults, supporting the importance of IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD8+ T cells in determining disease outcome.155\n",

In a study of infants predisposed to asthma and atopy, less robust mitogen-induced or specific antigen-induced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 responses from cord blood cells were associated with more wheezing episodes in the first year of life in children infected with RSV and rhinovirus.156 In the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) Project, cytokine-response profiles of cord blood and 1-year mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro identified that cord blood IFN-\u03b3 responses were inversely related to the frequency of viral respiratory infections and wheezing in infancy while enhanced IFN-\u03b3 responses at 1 year correlated positively with the frequency of preceding viral infections.157 Severity of asthma has been associated with excessive IFN-\u03b3 production, particularly by CD8+ T cells, potentially reflecting the cytotoxic effect of the cytokine. These data suggest that neonatal IFN-\u03b3 responses influence subsequent antiviral activity. Conversely, the frequency of viral infections in infancy can influence IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies provide important antiviral protection in infants. Higher RSV neutralizing antibody titers in both premature and term infants are associated with protection from infection and LRTI, an effect also supported by the success of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV disease in premature infants.158 Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies is inversely related to length of gestation such that the more preterm infants have relatively less humoral protection contributing to disease risk. Because viral loads of RSV, hMPV, PIV, and rhinovirus correlate with the severity of clinical disease,159, 160, 161, 162 it is suggested that infants with a greater ability to control viral replication on first infection, via the presence of neutralizing antibody and a more robust IFN-\u03b3 response, are successful in limiting excessive antigen presentation, generating protective immune responses associated with viral clearance, and avoiding immuno-pathogenesis. To date, no study has evaluated antibody and cellular immune phenotype together with viral load measurements in infants with respiratory infections. Additionally, the association between these factors and disease severity has not been explored in premature infants.",

            "text": "A developing body of research suggests that both the acquisition and maintenance of bacterial populations in the gut soon after birth are important drivers of the development of both systemic and mucosal immunity.7 Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have provided insight into the gut microbiome and are beginning to describe the diversity and dynamics of the microbial populations in both health and disease. Although the exact factors that control the interactions between the gut epithelial cells, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and the gut microbiome are not yet clear, all 3 components appear to play a significant role in the induction of immune tolerance to luminal bacterial antigens and the maintenance of homeostasis. Proposed mechanisms identified in animal models include the blocking of innate signaling via Toll-like receptor-4, the development or expansion of Fox P3+ Treg cells, and enhanced IL-10 production in the gut induced by commensal bacteria.163, 164 The presence of specific species of bacteria also may be crucial to the development of gut tolerance as suggested by the relatively decreased amounts of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus species in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.7 Additionally, the timing of acquisition of gut bacteria may be critical for the positive effects on health. Neonatal IL-10\u2013deficient mice exposed to bacterial antigens had delayed development of colitis at 18 weeks of age compared with those not exposed. Decreased IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 production in explanted intestinal tissue and spleen cells following stimulation with gut bacteria also suggests that exposure of the neonatal immune system to antigens of the microbiome is associated with both mucosal and systemic immune tolerance.8 These findings may be especially relevant to the preterm infant in view of recent data showing an inverse relationship between antibiotic therapy and parenteral nutrition with fecal diversity in the infants born at less than 29 weeks\u2019 gestation.165 A recent study in elderly adults also suggests improved protection from influenza infection with oral provision of a Bifidobacterium longum species.166\n",
