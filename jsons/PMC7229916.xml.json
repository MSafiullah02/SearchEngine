We aimed to evaluate the scope and quantity of publications during this period with key terms relating to Coronavirus, coagulopathy, thromboembolic disease, anticoagulant and thrombocytopenia. The other inclusion criteria were Haemostasis and Thrombosis topics in English language, journals with an Impact factor of more than 3 and Haemostasis Specialist journals. The search yielded 586 papers of which 103 were finally included after removing duplicates, inspecting the abstracts and full-text reviews. These are listed in Table 1\naccording to the journal of publication. Of note, whilst 23 reports documented original findings, the remaining 78 consisted of comments, editorials, letters, expert reviews, and guidelines.",

Hypoxia, hypercoagulability and stasis due to critical illness in the setting of severe sepsis are indeed known to increase the risk of VTE [8]. This association of venous and arterial thrombosis has now been determined to hold true for individuals affected by COVID-19, and to be linked with higher risk of all-cause mortality [9].",

            "text": "As an example, d-dimer was posited as a critical parameter/indicator of thrombotic complication associated with COVID-19. Debates on cut-off values and links to disease-severity and mortality were reported according to diverse patients\u2019 presentations, spanning countries, and incorporating varying hospital practices, and accounting for ethnic variability [13]. Deliberation surrounding the merits of using d-dimer as a prognostic indicator in the setting of COVID-19 generated metanalyses that were published earlier than would typically be expected in non-pandemic conditions [14]. Some investigators have reported the presence of VTE events at the time of admission [15]. Further, concerns of breakthrough risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite prophylactic anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients have also been raised [16,17]. Decisions about anticoagulation became more complicated, with studies exhibiting improvement in abnormal coagulation parameters or suggesting a survival benefit [18,19]. During these times of myriad uncertainties, debate predominates and social media platforms such as Twitter continue to be filled with puzzled physicians asking crucial questions about anticoagulation dosing as it relates to the severity of infection or d-dimer levels. Discourse on the value of prophylactic low molecular weight anticoagulation also draws on recommendations from international guidelines [20] or interim guidance suggesting systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin [21]. Despite the limited data, the high-stakes milieu and risk of litigation have led several institutions to adopt a more aggressive approach of using intermediate or full-dose anticoagulation for most of their critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit [22]. This approach has been tempered by others who have utilised the state of clinical equipoise as a catalyst for collaboration to initiate multicenter Randomised Control Trials (NCT04362085, NCT04345848, NCT04360824, NCT04377997) to more conclusively answer these questions.",

To achieve this, responsible debate and disagreement, and honest yet courteous critique provide a platform for a range of opinions to be expressed [29,30]. Medical journals afford readers the opportunity to submit comments, questions, or criticisms pertaining to published work. The discourse can be passionate and enlightening, exposing new perspectives for further deliberation. Yet in the midst of a deadly crisis, acknowledgement of the circumstances is paramount, and consideration of the underlying pressures more important than ever. Providing the necessary feedback in a respectful and considerate manner, tempered by humanity and kindness for our colleagues, their efforts, and the integrity of their work cannot be underestimated.",

It is imperative to keep in mind that opinions provided based on initial data may need to evolve as new details are reported.

A critical tenet of any scientific debate, which must be upheld in these scary and fast-moving times, is the need to maintain respect for others\u2019 scientific output, to trust in their bona fide intentions, and to exercise a humane and dignified manner with which to provide constructive critique. It is likewise important to harness this opportunity to develop innovative collaborations between dedicated professionals, rather than propagating competition. The vulnerability of the world and of humanity is a clear lesson imparted by COVID-19. It would behoove all of us to espouse the metaphoric \u201cwe are all in the same boat\u201d scenario and to build supportive teams in the true spirit of collaboration.
