However, it is widely acknowledged that the effects of focal cortical stimulation on behaviour can vary substantially between participants and even from trial to trial within individuals. Here we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in alertness can account for the variability in behavioural and neurophysiological responses to TMS. We combined single-pulse TMS with neural recording via electroencephalography (EEG) to quantify changes in motor and cortical reactivity with fluctuating levels of alertness defined objectively on the basis of ongoing brain activity. We observed rapid, non-linear changes in TMS-evoked neural responsesspecifically, motor evoked potentials and TMS-evoked cortical potentialsas EEG activity indicated decreasing levels of alertness, even while participants remained awake and responsive in the behavioural task.",

A number of neurophysiological indices of cortical TMS perturbation have been used to contrast experimental conditions of interest, including motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from peripheral muscles (Barker et al., 1985; Bestmann & Krakauer, 2015) , and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) which are thought to reflect the reactivity of underlying cortical circuits (Chung et al., 2015; . These and other outcome measures show varying sensitivity to different experimental manipulations, as well as confounding factors. Perhaps the largest within-participant variation in motor and cortical responses to TMS are observed when contrasting wakefulness and sleep. As healthy adult participants fall into slow wave sleep, MEP amplitude diminishes (Bergmann et al., 2012; Hess et al., 1987; Grosse et al., 2002) , whereas TEP amplitude increases in association with a breakdown of effective connectivity, reflecting a state shift from a global to a more local or stereotypical mode of processing (Massimini et al., 2005) .",

To date, however, it is not known whether the effects of TMS on neural activity are influenced by fluctuations in the level of alertness that occur during wakefulness.

The implicit assumption is that participants' levels or alertness remain relatively consistent for the duration of the testing session. This assumption has recently been challenged by findings from brain imaging studies. For instance, Tagliazucchi and Laufs (2014) found that 30% of research participants drifted into a drowsy state (N1 sleep) during resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) protocols after only three minutes. These periods of early N1 sleep during passive resting-state scans were accompanied by increased signal variance in sensory and motor cortices, increased temporal-temporal and temporal-frontal connectivity, and decreased thalamic-frontal connectivity patterns (Tagliazucchi & Laufs, 2014) , highlighting a pervasive source of variance in neuroimaging data due to drowsiness. Likewise, using an active decision-making task, De Gee et al. (2017) demonstrated that brainstem-controlled inter-trial fluctuations in phasic arousal are accompanied by modulation in the involvement of prefrontal and parietal cortices in choice encoding, again implying that fluctuating levels of alertness are potentially a significant source of variability in neural activity.",

Several studies have shown that a significant portion of this variance is related to EEG oscillatory activity in a pre-TMS time window (M\u00e4ki & Ilmoniemi, 2010; Sauseng et al., 2009; Zarkowski et al., 2006) . In particular, trials with higher pre-stimulation alpha power tend to be associated with lower MEP amplitude (Sauseng et al., 2009; Zarkowski et al., 2006) . To the extent that increases in alpha power are associated with decreased levels of alertness in participants who are awake and have their eyes open (Gharagozlou et al., 2015; Kaida et al., 2006) , spontaneous fluctuations in alertness could be a significant source of inter-trial MEP variability. Unfortunately, previous TMS investigations have not measured or controlled for changes in alertness in their participants, and so it remains unknown whether fluctuations in alertness are systematically associated with changes in TMS-evoked neural activity.",

Alertness Levels and unresponsive trials tended to be spread across the testing session, i.e., participants tended to \"oscillate\" between awake and drowsy states (see Fig 1E and S1). Consequently, there was no systematic increase or decrease in Alertness Level within a session at the group level. Four participants showed a significant but weak positive correlation between Alertness Level and trial number (mean rho=0.21), 6 participants showed a significant negative association (mean rho=-0.27), while the remaining 10 participants showed no significant correlation between Alertness Level and trial number (mean rho=-0.008) (see Fig S1) .

As shown in Figure 2B , there was a significant increase in MEP amplitude between Alertness Levels 1 and 4 (t(19)=3.5, p=0.0096, d=0.64), as well as an intermediate stepped increase across Alertness Levels 2 (d=0.15) and 3 (d=0.23), and a small decrease at Alertness Level 5 (d=0.27). A linear trend of increasing MEP amplitude was observed across Alertness Levels 1-4 (F(1,19)=11.55, p=0.003, partial \u03b72=0.38), but this was no longer significant when Level 5 was also included (F(1,19)=2.11, p=0.165, partial \u03b72=0.1). These findings indicate a reliably non-linear reorganization of corticospinal excitability at a time when drowsy participants are still conscious and responsive. The most noticeable change in dynamics occurred with the disappearance of alpha waves, at a point where there was EEG flattening and the first occurrence of EEG theta-range ripples, i.e., Alertness Levels 4 and 5despite the fact that participants were still responding behaviourally in the task. These observations suggest a much earlier modulation of corticospinal excitability in the initial moments of drowsiness than has been reported previously in studies of MEP changes with sleep deprivation or during NREM sleep (De Gennaro et al., 2007; Grosse et al., 2002; Manganotti et al., 2004) .",

Here we used single-pulse TMS delivered over the right motor cortex while simultaneously measuring MEPs and TEPs across different, objectively defined levels of alertness while participants engaged in a simple tactile perception task. Participants exhibited fluctuating levels of alertness across the testing session, as indexed by continuous EEG recordings, but continued to respond behaviourally even in relatively deep states of drowsiness. Strikingly, both motor evoked responses and TMS-evoked cortical reactivity were altered across different levels of alertness. Specifically, we found that MEP amplitudes peaked during EEG flattening (Alertness Level 4), whereas TEP cortical reactivity increased earlier and remained stable across Alertness Levels 4 and 5. These findings highlight that a substantial proportion of inter-trial variability in neurophysiological responses to TMS can potentially be attributed to spontaneous fluctuation in alertness.",

            "text": "Inter-trial and inter-subject variability in MEP amplitude is a well-known source of data variance in TMS experiments (Kiers et al., 1993; Ellaway et al., 1998; R\u00f6sler et al., 2008; Schutter et al., 2010; Sommer et al., 2002) , and it has been suggested that 30 or more trials are required to provide a reliable estimate of MEP amplitude (Goldsworthy et al., 2016) . The non-stationarity of MEP amplitudes has been attributed to a number of factors, including prestimulus voluntary muscle contraction (Kiers et al., 1993) , variation in the number of recruited alpha-motor neurons (R\u00f6sler et al., 2008) , variation in the synchronization of motor neuron discharges (R\u00f6sler et al., 2008) and functional hemispheric asymmetries (Schutter et al., 2010) . Furthermore, a recent series of studies found that the amplitude or phase of pre-TMS EEG oscillations can predict MEP amplitude, including alpha (Iscan et al., 2016; Sauseng et al., 2009; Schulz et al., 2014; Zarkowski et al., 2006) , beta (M\u00e4ki & Ilmoniemi, 2010; Keil et al., 2014; Schulz et al., 2014) and gamma (Zarkowski et al., 2006) frequency bands. Extending these studies, our findings suggest that changing levels of alertness could be a key factor in brain state-modulation of corticospinal excitability. For instance, Zarkowski et al. (2006) demonstrated that MEP amplitude is negatively correlated with pre-TMS alpha power (10-13 Hz) and positively correlated with pre-TMS gamma power (30-60 Hz), with an alpha/gamma ratio being the strongest predictor of MEP amplitude. While a theta/alpha ratio can index the level of alertness in eyes-closed experiments, such as in the present study, the alertness-indexing frequencies are shifted upward in eyes-open paradigms (Eoh et al., 2005; Kaida et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2012) . It is therefore likely that the results of Zarkowski et al. (2006) and other studies were influenced by changing levels of alertness in the participant sample.",

While several studies have reported an increase in corticospinal motor threshold following sleep deprivation (Manganotti et al., 2001; De Gennaro et al., 2007) , other studies have failed to find any such effect (Civardi et al., 2001; Manganotti et al., 2006) . Arguably, due to individual differences in instantaneous drowsiness levels and potentially different time of day and duration of testing, the dominant level of alertness varied between these studies, confounding their comparison. For instance, datasets with a relatively high proportion of trials obtained during Alertness Level 4 would likely indicate higher MEP amplitude compared with other datasets. Unfortunately, a fine-grained measurement of alertness is seldom undertaken in MEP studies, even when EEG is recorded, e.g., \"sleepiness\" or NREM Stage 1 sleep are usually treated as a uniform state (Manganotti et al., 2004) , even though a more detailed analysis can reveal at least 6 micro-states within N1 sleep (Hori et al., 1994;  see Fig 1C) .",

Contrary to our results, however, they found no association between TEP amplitude and short-lasting episodes of drowsiness. This discrepancy is most likely attributable to the fact that Huber et al. (2013) relied solely on a behavioural definition of drowsiness (performance in a visuomotor tracking task), whereas we used fine-grained EEG measures of alertness that could be quantified independently of fluctuations in behaviour. In another recent study, TEP amplitude was found to depend on the interaction between sleep pressure and a phase of circadian cycle rather than sleep homeostasis alone (Ly et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the same study found that an increase in TEP amplitude was associated with an increase in EEG theta power across 29 h of sustained wakefulness. Unfortunately, the authors did not report whether such an association held over a shorter period of time (e.g., 45 -90 mins), as would be the case in typical TMS studies.",

Similarly, an increase in TEP amplitude is observed during dreamless xenon anaesthesia, whereas dreamful ketamine anaesthesia shows no changes in TEP amplitude compared with wakefulness, suggesting a specific link between TEP amplitude and (un)consciousness (Sarasso et al., 2015) . Contrary to these suggestions, however, here we found that the perturbational TEP marker of (un)consciousness arose at an early stage of drowsiness, when participants were still able to respond behaviourally and well before they fell asleep. Thus, we would suggest that changes in local cortical processing as indexed by TEPs primarily reflect different levels of alertness rather than the presence or absence of sensory awareness.",

(2017) showed that trials with a high MEP amplitude were also associated with a relatively high TEP amplitude compared with trials with a low MEP amplitude. In the present study, we found a gradually increasing intertrial variability of TEP amplitude across decreasing levels of alertness. By contrast, variability in MEP amplitude showed a more complex U-shaped pattern characterised by an initial decrease during early stages of drowsiness and a subsequent increase with higher levels of drowsiness, suggesting potentially independent neural pathways in the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Nevertheless, while TEP and MEP amplitudes showed no correlation at Alertness Levels 1 and 2, these two neural indices became positively correlated with increasing drowsiness, i.e. at Alertness Levels 3-5. These findings suggest that withintrial associations between corticospinal excitability (MEP) and cortical reactivity (TEP) depend on the level of alertness, which should be controlled for when experiments involve hundreds of trials delivered over a prolonged testing session (Fecchio et al., 2017; Helfrich et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Several strategies exist for dealing with changing levels of alertness during behavioural testing. If alertness decreases throughout a session, an additional factor of trial or block number could be added to a statistical model as an alertness regressor or covariate. However, we found that an initial decrease in alertness did not persist throughout the testing session, and participants tended to \"oscillate\" between awake and drowsy periods (see Fig S1) , which precludes any straightforward inference of decreasing alertness over the course of a single testing session. Alternatively, reaction times (RTs) could be used as a behavioural index of alertness in active TMS experiments, as RTs typically lengthen with decreases in vigilance (Schmidt et al., 2009) , increases in drowsiness (Ogilvie & Wilkinson, 1984) , and following sleep deprivation (Ratcliff & Van Dongen, 2011) . However, such a strategy would not be possible in passive paradigms in which participants are not required to respond (Gordon et al., 2018; Massimini et al., 2005) . Furthermore, as both trial counts and reaction times are relative measures, participants who maintain high alertness throughout a session could be falsely labelled as drowsy in a proportion of trials. Arguably, concurrent EEG recording should be the gold standard for assessment of single-trial alertness, as it provides quantifiable and reliable signatures of instantaneous brain-states, including alpha-and theta-derived Hori stages of sleep onset (Hori et al., 1994) . As an alternative to the tedious manual scoring of Hori stages (Alertness Levels), an automated EEG method based on wakefulness and sleep grapho-elements is available for the detection of drowsiness from EEG data (Jagannathan et al., 2018) . While methods that weight the dominance of EEG theta and alpha oscillations are suitable for eyes-closed paradigms (Hori et al., 1994; Jagannathan et al., 2018) , such as resting state or phosphene studies (Bonnard et al., 2016; De Graaf et al., 2017) , the power of higher EEG frequencies should be considered when assessing alertness during active eyesopen experiments (Eoh et al., 2005; Kaida et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2012) . Finally, when EEG measurements are not available or feasible, TMS experiments could be carried out in short blocks of just a few minutes each (e.g., 3-5 min) and inter-block intervals could be used to assess instantaneous subjective sleepiness, for example by asking participants to undertake the 9-graded Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (\u00c5kerstedt & Gillberg, 1990; Kaida et al., 2006) . paradigms. It will also be important to investigate whether neurophysiological effects of decreasing alertness are limited to individuals who are likely to fall asleep in a situation of prolonged inactivity, such as our participants. If this turned out to be the case, it might be advisable to selectively recruit individuals who are very unlikely to fall asleep during daytime hours to TMS experiments that require a high and stable level of alertness.",

The site for stimulation was the point on the scalp over the motor cortex that elicited the largest and most consistent amplitude MEPs from the left FDI. This stimulation 'hotspot' was found by placing the TMS coil tangentially on the scalp with the handle pointing posteriorly and laterally at ~45\u00b0 to the sagittal plane, and stimulating at an intensity that was assumed to be slightly suprathreshold for most individuals. Once the hotspot had been identified it was marked using an infrared neuro-navigation system (Visor 2 by ANT Neuro; Enschede, The Netherlands). A small piece of foam (~ 5) mm thick was then placed under the centre of the TMS coil so that it was not in physical contact with any EEG electrodes. The hotspot was remarked and the location and orientation of the TMS coil were maintained throughout the testing session with the aid of the neuro-navigation system. Accuracy of coil position and handle orientation were kept within 5 mm and 5 degrees, respectively, but were typically within 3 mm and 3 degrees. Resting motor threshold was determined using the relative frequency method with a criterion of \u226550 \u00b5V (peak-to-peak) MEP amplitude in at least five out of ten consecutive trials Rossini et al., 1994; Samii et al., 1996) .

Given that TMS stimulator output intensity is measured in whole numbers from 1 to 100, the calculated percentage from threshold intensity was rounded. This yielded slightly different sized steps from -20% to +20% for some individuals, and this was taken into consideration when fitting sigmoidal functions at the single participant level. For each individual, 520 trials of single pulse TMS were delivered, with an average inter-pulse interval of 9.5 sec and a uniformly distributed random jitter of \u00b11000 ms. Thus, the inter-pulse interval lasted between 8.5-10.5 s. We incorporated a relatively long inter-pulse interval to facilitate the natural development of drowsiness, and to allow sufficient time for a return of tonic EMG activity to its baseline level. As our aim was to obtain the maximum number of evoked responses (MEPs and TEPs) around the TMS threshold intensity, the following number of trials was delivered at each TMS intensity: 40 trials (7.7% of a total) at each of the -20%, -15%, -10%, +10%, +15% and +20% intensities; 80 trials (15.4% of a total) at each of the -5% and -5% intensities; 120 trials (23.1% of a total) at 0% (i.e., at the individual resting motor threshold).

The noisiest epochs were manually deleted, and the most deviant EEG channels were detected with the 'spectopo' function before running the independent component analysis (ICA) for further removal of artefacts such as eye blinks and saccades, heartbeats, and muscle noise. ICA was carried out on relatively clean channels only, whereas the noisy channels were recalculated by spherical spline interpolation of surrounding channels after deleting ICA components with artefacts. Data were again manually inspected and several remaining noisy epochs were deleted. On average, 58 trials (11.2%) were discarded per single participant during EMG and EEG pre-processing, leaving on average 462 trials per participant (SD=38; Range=348-513 trials) for the subsequent analyses.",

To apply this measure, theta (4.5-7.5 Hz) and alpha (8.5-11.5 Hz) power was first averaged in time from -2000 ms to -12 ms, and the \u03b8/\u03b1 ratio was then calculated for each trial and electrode.

Using modified functions of FieldTrip toolbox (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007; Oostenveld et al., 2011) , we compared corresponding spatiotemporal points in individual awake and drowsy trials with an independent samples t-test. Although this step was parametric, FieldTrip uses a nonparametric clustering method (Bullmore et al., 1999) to address the multiple comparisons problem. t values of adjacent spatiotemporal points whose p values were less than 0.05 were clustered together by summating their t values, and the largest such cluster was retained. A minimum of two neighbouring electrodes had to pass this threshold to form a cluster, with the neighbourhood defined as other electrodes within a 4 cm radius. This whole procedure, that is, calculation of t values at each spatiotemporal point followed by clustering of adjacent t values, was repeated 1000 times, with recombination and randomized resampling before each repetition. This Monte Carlo method generated a nonparametric estimate of the p value representing the statistical significance of the originally identified cluster. The cluster-level t value was calculated as the sum of the individual t values at the points within the cluster.",

No amplitude difference was observed between awake and drowsy trials (see Fig S4) , ruling out the possibility that TEP corticalreactivity changes between awake and drowsy states were due to a change in the intensity of scalp muscle contraction.",

Huynh-Feldt correction was used when Mauchly's test indicated violation of the assumption of sphericity.

Non-parametric Spearman's rank order correlation test was used to assess for an association between single-trial MEP and TEP responses, with the Bonferroni-Holm correction of p values (Holm, 1979) . Aiming to avoid sample size effects when comparing pooled single-trial data across different levels of alertness, the trial number was matched by randomly selecting 936 trials for each Alertness Level, which was the minimum number observed in one of the conditions.
