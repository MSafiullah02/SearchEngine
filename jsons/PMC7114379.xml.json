The coordination among different stages of virus infection has been the focus for RNA virology. It is believed that un-translated region (UTR) of the RNA genome plays a central role in balancing these processes, via different sequence motifs, alternative high-order structures, and interacting with other viral or host factors (Chang and Luo, 2006, Garneau et al., 2008, Liu and Leibowitz, 2010, Uzri and Gehrke, 2009, Zust et al., 2008). For instance, complete 3\u2032 UTR deletion of poliovirus genome has deleterious effect on virus replication (Rohll et al., 1995, Todd et al., 1997). In addition, it has been reported that positive-strand RNA virus 3\u2032 UTR can control viral gene translation as an independent enhancer or indirect interaction with the internal ribosome entry site of the 5\u2032 UTR (Koh et al., 2002, Lopez de Quinto et al., 2002). The 3\u2032 UTR structure of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genome remains largely unknown.",

PRRSV genome is about 15 kb in length, containing at least nine open reading frames (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR. Based on the overall genetic relationship, PRRSV is further classified as two genotypes, European (type I) and North American (type II), between which 60% genetic identity of the overall genomic sequences exists (Mateu and Diaz, 2008). PRRSV is known for its genetic heterogeneity, up to 21% intra-genotypic diversity for type II PRRSV has been reported (Key et al., 2001, Mateu and Diaz, 2008, Meng, 2000). Interestingly, these two distinct PRRSV genotypes were identified almost simultaneously as the causative agents of blue-ear disease in two different continents (Collins et al., 1992, Plagemann, 2003, Wensvoort et al., 1991), which demonstrat that these two genotype virus share the same key functional component in virus replication or transcription process.",

            "text": "Similar to the coronavirus, arterivirus RNA synthesis is initiated at the genomic 3\u2032 end, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) binds and initiates the synthesis of the negative strand genome-length RNA and a set of subgenomic RNAs, formed by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism (Beerens et al., 2007, Meng et al., 1996, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). These negative-sense RNAs then serve as templates for the synthesis of progeny viral RNA genome and a series of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic RNAs (Pasternak et al., 2006). The UTR sequence and structural elements are believed to play a vital regulatory role in these RNA synthesis processes. It was reported that the Lelystad virus (LV), the prototypic type I PRRSV can tolerate 7 nt deletion, but 30 nt deletion in the 114 nt length of LV 3\u2032 UTR abolished RNA replication (Verheije et al., 2001, Verheije et al., 2002). With a shorter 3\u2032 UTR of 59 nt, the EAV 3\u2032 genomic terminus forms up to five stem-loop (SL) structures, with the SL5 located in 3\u2032 UTR forming a pseudoknot with the SL4 coding for nucleocapsid (N) protein (Beerens and Snijder, 2007). Interestingly, part of the SL4 analogue, located in PRRSV LV 3\u2032 UTR, is also engaged in a kissing-loop interaction with a 7 nt sequence coding for the LV N protein (Beerens and Snijder, 2007, Verheije et al., 2001, Verheije et al., 2002). These results demonstrated that arterivirus replication is also regulated by structural elements residing in the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. Previous studies find that the 911 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome contains the minimal cis-acting element required for type II PRRS viral replication (Choi et al., 2006). Beyond that, little is known about regulatory elements for PRRSV type II, which has the longest 3\u2032 UTR (151 nt) among the arteriviruses. In particular, it remains unresolved that if the 3\u2032 UTR of the two genotypes of PRRSV play a similar role in PRRSV replication process, despite of the distinct relationship in primary sequence and the length.",

Based on the full-length infectious cDNA clone of pAPRRS (Yu et al., 2009, Yuan and Wei, 2008), we conducted reverse genetic manipulations to the PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR, and found that 1) the first 40 nt of the 5\u2032 proximal region of type II PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR is dispensable for viral infectivity in cultured cells; and surprisingly, 2) the entire 3\u2032 UTR of the type I PRRSV is fully functional in the backbone of pAPRRS, despite that only 63% pair-wise genetic identity between the two 3\u2032 UTR. Our data provide clues that the high order structural elements residing in 3\u2032 UTR might play a critical role for porcine arterivirus replication.",

GQ330474), was used as the shuttle plasmid for mutagenesis PCR (Yuan and Wei, 2008). Six oligonucleotides primers (Table 1\n) containing appropriate restriction enzyme sites and the desired mutations were designed and synthesized based on APRRS genomic sequences, and Quick-Change PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) was carried out on the pTB5c plasmid, as instructed by the supplier. The infectous cDNA clone containing the 40 bp deletion was produced by three way ligation. Two primer pairs SF13013/SRLVAscUR and SFLVAscUR/Qst (Table 1) were used to amplify two PCR fragments, then the PCR fragments were digested with single enzyme site Spe I and Pac I, Pac I and Xho I (immediately downstream of the genomic poly(A)-tail), respectively. The full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS was treated with Spe I and Xho I, and then the gel-purified pAPRRS Spe I/Xho I was used as the vector arm for assembly of the full-length cDNA clones. Three purified fragments were used for the three-way ligation, yielding the full-length mutant clones p3URAD40. To investigate whether the inserted Asc I cutting site affects the virus replication, a splicing-overlap-extension (S.O.E) PCR was used to construct full-length clone p3URD40, in which the polylinker was eliminated. Primer pairs SF13103 and SR15270-40U, SF15411N and Qst (Table 1) were used to amplify two PCR fragments, using pAPRRS as template. Two purified PCR fragments were used as templates for second round PCR, subsequently primer SF13103 and Qst were used to amplify. The final mutant fragment was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector named pK3URD40. The plasmid pK3URD40 and parental pAPRRS were digested with Spe I and Xho I, and then the purified DNA fragments were ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas, SANGON, Shanghai) to construct the full-length clone p3URD40. Chimeric plasimd pSURLV was constructed by using primer pairs SF13013/LVAscUR, and LVAscUF/Qst, but the second PCR fragment was amplified with type I PRRSV cDNA as template, pLV5c (a kind gift of Dr. Zhuang) was the cDNA clone covering ORF7-3\u2032 UTR of the PRRSV Lelystad virus (GenBank Accession Number: M96262).

To do so, we compared the 3\u2032 UTR nucleotide sequences of five representative strains of each type I and type II PRRSV. The genotype I strains include LV (GenBank Accession No. M96262), SD01-08 (DQ489311), EuroPRRS (AY366525), and LV421 (AY588319), and five type II strains including VR2332 (AY150564), JX143 (EF488048), p129 (AF494042), CH1a (AY032626) and APRRS (GQ330474). As shown in Fig. 1\n, the type I PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR is 37 nt shorter than that of type II, which located at immediately downstream of the ORF7 stop codon. However, the 3\u2032 UTR sequences are extremely intra-genotypically conserved. In addition, the pair-wise genetic identity between the two genotypes is 63%, and yet inter-typically conserved domains, shaded in black, do exist. We arbitrarily designated these inter-typically conserved domains as CS1 (conserved sequence), CS2, a possible long bulged stem-loop region LSL, and VR represents variable region. The main goal of this study is to investigate the possible effect of these 3\u2032 UTR sequence on PRRSV virus replication. To facilitate reverse genetic manipulation, we inserted a stretch of sequence consisting of Pac I and Asc I recognition sites. Next, utilizing the Asc I site, we deleted the extra 40 nt region of type II PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR, compared with that of type I, and the resultant full-length plasmid was designated as pURAD40 (Fig. 2\n). Utilizing SOE-PCR, we then took out the Pac I and Asc I site in order to eliminate the possible adverse effect of the Pac I and Asc I recognition sequence. Finally, based on pURD40, we replaced the entire 3\u2032 UTR sequence with that of type I, such that the pSURLV is the full-length cDNA clone in the backbone of type II PRRSV containing the type I 3\u2032 UTR. All full-length cDNA clones were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing.",

Meanwhile, to test that the CPE was PRRSV-specific, the transfected cell monolayer was fixed at 3 dpi, and stained by monoclonal antibody against the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein, followed staining by the Alex fluor-label anti-Mouse antibody. As shown in Fig. 3\n, the transfectant virus v3URAD40 and v3URD40 deletion of 40 nt with or without an extra Pac I and Asc I site also developed the same IFA profile, and has no adverse effect on nucleocapsid protein subcellular distribution, demonstrating that the first 40 nt of the 3\u2032 UTR is dispensable for PRRSV viability in cultured cells.

Moreover, full-length sequence of rescued virus vSURLV showed some nucleotides sequence alterations in the genome of the rescued viruses. 5 nucleotide differences were identified (Table 2\n) when the DNA sequence of the vSURLV genome was compared to previously published full-length sequences of APRRS (GenBank accession numbers GQ330474).

There were no morphology and size differences of the viral plaques between and among v3URAD40, v3URD40, and that of the parental vAPRRS (Fig. 5\nA).

To do so, the P5 viruses were inoculated in fresh MARC-145 cells at a dose of 1 MOI, followed by collecting the infected cultured supernatant at the indicated time points (Fig. 5B). The virus yield of each harvest was determined by measuring plaque numbers. The single step growth curves of v3URAD40, and vURD40 were virtually the same with that of the parental vAPRRS (Fig. 5B), again indicated that the starting region of the 3\u2032 UTR is dispensable for virus infectivity. In the same manner, the single step growth curve of vSURLV was assessed. However, time-point vSURLV titer was one or two log lower than the parental vAPRRS (Fig. 5B). Such difference was particularly obvious at the initial stage of the infection process, demonstrated that the type I 3\u2032 UTR exerted effect on the early stage of virus infection.

It is not unexpected that the extra 40 nt stretch is dispensable for the viability of type II PRRSV, which has the longest 3\u2032 UTR among the arteriviruses. In this study, we demonstrated that all virological properties including plaque morphology, size and viral growth kinetics, as well as the sgmRNA profiles remain unchanged in vURAD40, indicating that this 40 nt stretch located at the 5\u2032 proximal end of the 3\u2032 UTR of the type II PRRSV is indeed nonessential for virus replication in cultured MARC-145 cells. We are attempting to delimit the minimal 3\u2032 UTR cis-acting signals for virus replication, and RNA synthesis processes including these of the minus-strand, genomic and sgmRNAs. The delimitation of maximal nonessential 3\u2032 UTR sequence is under way. The 3\u2032 UTR can influence virus life cycle through different regions, it includes both variable region and conserved region which may affect virus characterization in different aspects. Several studies demonstrated that a hypervariable region (HVR) and some RNA stem-loops of the genomic RNA of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are nonessential for the virus replication in tissue culture, and yet the 3\u2032 UTR HVR played a significant role in viral pathogenesis in vivo (Goebel et al., 2007). Similar observations have been made on flaviviruses including the Dengue virus and bovine viral diarrhea disease virus (BVDV), based on which one can rationally design an attenuated vaccine by deleting the 3\u2032 UTR motif that is nonessential for in vitro culture but critical for in vivo virulence (Hanley et al., 2004, Pankraz et al., 2005).

Using the same parameters, Fig. 8B showed that the overall structure remained the same with that shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, implying that the former may play an essential role for PRRSV type II viral replication.",

It was reported that high-order structure including pseudoknot are highly conserved among the coronavirus 3\u2032 UTRs (Williams et al., 1999). A similar pseudoknot interaction between the main 3\u2032 UTR loop and the upstream coding sequence for nucleocapsid of EAV was proved to be critical for virus replication (Beerens and Snijder, 2006). Intriguingly, the pseudoknot interacting upstream loop (SL4 counterpart, shaded in Fig. 7C, shaded and circled in Fig. 8B) was found to form another kissing-loop interaction with a 7 nt sequence coding for the N-terminal of the nucleocapsid protein of the type I PRRSV (Verheije et al., 2002). In this study, the predicted structure showed that the long bulged stem-loop could be a critical regulating element for porcine arterivirus replication. Surprisingly, the pseudoknot interacting arms found in EAV formed virtually perfect long stem (shaded base, Fig. 7C, Fig. 8B). Although the exact secondary structure of PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR need to be experimentally confirmed, it is plausible that different viral replication stages can be regulated by the conformational switch between the kissing-loop, pseudoknot, and long stem structure.",

Later on, the same lab (Goebel et al., 2004b) reported that the SARS-CoV 3\u2032 UTR can functionally substitute the group II MHV counter, despite that only 38% genetic identity shared by the two 3\u2032 UTRs. In our study, we obtain the similar conclusion as in coronavirus, the heterologous UTR will not affect virus replication and transcription process, however, the chimeric virus vSURLV replication efficiency decreased obviously. Although the chimeric virus can successfully accomplish the life cycle and virus packaging as they share the same molecular switch structure, the subtle difference may affect the virus titer.",
