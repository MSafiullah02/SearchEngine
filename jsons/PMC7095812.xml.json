Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a main component of outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been referred to be an important risk factor of ALI [3, 4]. Intratracheal administration of LPS has gained wide acceptance as a clinically relevant model of severe lung injury. In the clinical cases, ALI is a major problem that has a high mortality rate of 30\u201340 % and there are still few effective measures or specific medicines to treat it [5, 6]. Therefore, the development of novel therapies for ALI is urgently needed.",

In recent years, gossypol has been shown to exhibit a variety of other pharmacological activities, including anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-virus and anti-inflammatory activities [9\u201311]. Gossypol was found to inhibit the activation of human T-lymphocytes stimulated with polyclonal activators, to suppress NF-\u03baB activity and NF-\u03baB-related genes expression in human leukemia U937 cells [12]. Although a number of studies have addressed the therapeutic potential of gossypol, its ability to protect against bacterial endotoxin-induced ALI remains poorly understood. In this study, we sought to assess the preventive effects of gossypol in a LPS-induced mouse ALI model and elucidated the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism.\n",

Though several candidate therapies have been applied to reduce lung injury, there are still few effective measures or specific medicines to treat it. Gossypol is a yellow polyphenolic compound isolated from cottonseed and has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects recently. In the present study, we observed the effect of gossypol on ALI induced by LPS in mice. The results showed that pretreatment with gossypol attenuated lung damage induced by LPS and decreased the W/D ratio, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell migration into the lung, protein leakage, the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK. This suggests that gossypol may be a promising potential therapeutic reagent for ALI treatment.",

Our experiments showed that gossypol significantly inhibits edema of the lung, as shown by a W/D ratio in the gossypol group that was significantly lower than the LPS group. MPO activity, reflecting the parenchymal infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, LPS-induced ALI is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils in the lung, exhibiting increased MPO activity [6, 15]. In this study, we found that LPS administration significantly increased the MPO activity and pretreatment with gossypol decreased LPS-induced increases in MPO activity in the lungs.

NF-\u03baB is normally present in the cytoplasm as a heterodimer and is linked to the inhibitory proteins I\u03baBs. Once activated, NF-\u03baB units p65 dissociates from its inhibitory protein I\u03baB-\u03b1 and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they may trigger the transcription of specific target genes such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [24]. In this study, we tested the effects of gossypol on NF-\u03baB activation and I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation. The results showed that LPS stimulation dramatically increased the phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB p65 protein. However, LPS-induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB p65 activation were significantly blocked by pretreatment with gossypol. MAPKs also play an important role in inducing cytokine production [25, 26]. The LPS stimulation of murine macrophages has been known to induce phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPKs [27]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of gossypol on activation (phosphorylation) of three MAPKs induced by LPS in the mice of ALI. The results showed that gossypol (2.5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) inhibited the phosphorylation of p42\u2013p44 ERK, p38, and p46\u2013p54 JNK in LPS-stimulated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that gossypol may exert its anti-inflammatory action by inhibition of the NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways activation.",
