We have investigated the role of these heptad-repeat regions and, specifically, the importance of the putative interhelical a and d position sidechains by using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. All the mutant glycoproteins were expressed and transported to the cell surface. Proteolytic maturation at the subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1-protease (SKI-1/S1P) cleavage site was observed in all but two of the mutants. Among the adequately cleaved mutant glycoproteins, four positions in the N-terminal region (I333, L336, L347 and L350) and two positions in the C-terminal region (R392 and W395) were shown to be important determinants of cell -cell fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that a-helical coiled-coil structures are likely critical in promoting arenavirus membrane fusion. These findings support the inclusion of the arenavirus GP-C among the Class I viral fusion proteins and suggest pharmacologic and immunologic strategies for targeting arenavirus infection and hemorrhagic fever.

            "text": "The arenaviruses are enveloped bisegmented RNA viruses whose genome consists of two single-stranded RNA molecules Clegg et al., 2000) . During biogenesis, arenaviral particles assemble and bud at the plasma membrane. The mature envelope glycoprotein complex of the arenavirus consists of three noncovalently associated subunits derived from the GP-C precursor by proteolytic cleavage events: a stable myristoylated 58 amino-acid signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding G1 subunit and the transmembrane G2 fusion protein (Buchmeier, 2002; Eichler et al., 2003; York et al., 2004) . The initial cleavage to yield SSP is likely mediated by the cellular signal peptidase, and the mature G1 and G2 subunits are subsequently generated by the cellular SKI-1/S1P protease. Both cleavage events, as well as the presence of the myristoylated SSP subunit, are required for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion (York et al., 2004) . Entry of virion particles into host cells is initiated by G1 binding to cell surface receptors followed by endocytosis of the virion into smooth vesicles (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994) . Although adystroglycan serves as a binding receptor for the Old World arenaviruses (Cao et al., 1998) , the receptor utilized by the major New World group of arenaviruses is unknown (Spiropoulou et al., 2002) . Membrane fusion is pH-dependent and is activated upon acidification of the maturing endosome (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994; Castilla et al., 1994; Di Simone and Buchmeier, 1995; Di Simone et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "The molecular basis for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion in the arenaviruses is largely unknown, however, sequence analysis of the G2 ectodomain of Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) has revealed two heptad-repeat regions that can be represented to form amphipathic helices (Gallaher et al., 2001) . This sequence motif is found among the large group of viral envelope glycoproteins that promote membrane fusion through the formation of a fusion-active core structure comprising a stable bundle of six a-helices. These Class I fusion proteins include those of the retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and coronaviruses. In these proteins, the six-helix bundle structure involves a central coiled coil, formed by Nterminal heptad-repeat regions of the trimeric fusion subunit ectodomain, surrounded by three anti-parallel helices of the Cterminal heptad repeats which bind to the conserved hydrophobic grooves on the coiled-coil surface. Formation of this thermodynamically favored six-helix bundle brings the viral and cell membranes into apposition and is thought to provide the driving energy to initiate membrane fusion (Earp et al., 2005; Eckert and Kim, 2001; Hughson, 1997; Weissenhorn et al., 1999 and references therein) . In keeping with the proposal that the arenavirus G2 ectodomain might also form a fusionactive six-helix bundle, Gallaher and colleagues have shown that a synthetic peptide derived from the N-terminal heptadrepeat region of LCMV is able to assume a-helical content (Gallaher et al., 2001) .",

Upon inspection of the aligned sequences, a unique register of a and d positions was apparent (Figs. 1A and B) . The a and d positions of the proposed N-terminal helix consist of hydrophobic residues common to the central interface of a trimeric coiled coil (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, methionine and valine). Positions assumed to lie on the exterior face of the coiled coil (b, c and f positions) contain polar or charged residues. This pattern is repeated through the C-terminal heptad-repeat region and appears to end at the C-terminal-most d and a positions (K409 and D413, respectively). Hydrophilic residues at two a positions in the New World viruses (R392 and S399) are replaced by less polar amino acids in the Old World viruses (serine and alanine, respectively). The hydrophilic sidechains, if buried, may impart specificity to the process of coiled-coil folding at the expense of thermal stability (Ji et al., 2000; Lumb and Kim, 1995) .",

Each a and d position amino acid was individually changed to alanine, a small residue that is a good helix inducer yet contributes little to the hydrophobic forces that predominantly stabilize coiled-coil structures. Alanine substitutions at these positions are likely to alter the stability of the proposed six-helix bundle, but not to disrupt its overall folding. We anticipated that alanine mutations at interhelical positions within the coiled-coil bundle may selectively affect the ability of the envelope glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion.",

Phosphorimages of the deglycosylated polypeptides represented in Fig. 1B were analyzed using Image Gauge software (Fuji) and the Profile and Background tools to quantitate the radioactivity (PSL units). The efficiency of SKI-1/S1P cleavage was defined as the ratio of PSL units in the sum of the G1 + G2 peaks relative to the total number in both GP-C and G1 + G2 peaks. Results were analyzed for two complete experiments, and the relative conclusions are consistent with those of additional partial studies. Because the absolute efficiency of cleavage varied between experiments, each experiment was normalized to the average extent of cleavage in the entire 19member panel. This average ratio (16% and 24% in the two complete experiments shown here) was used to determine the relative degree of cleavage in each mutant, and these numbers were averaged to generate the values plotted.

Flow cytometric analysis of cell-surface envelope glycoprotein. Vero cells expressing the envelope glycoproteins were stained using the G1-specific neutralizing MAb BE08 (Sanchez et al., 1989 ) and subsequently stained using propidium iodide (1 Ag/ml) to exclude dead cells in the population. Cells were fixed using 2% formaldehyde and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Background staining of mock-transfected cells is shown in the first panel; the non-expressing cell population within the GP-C transfected cultures (other panels) tend to pick up additional staining, possibly due to membrane exchange within the culture. The expressing cell populations were defined using a gate of !30 that included <0.1% of the mock-transfected population (arrow). or oligomer composition, would limit our ability to generalize from our simple reconstitution model. In the case of the cleavage-site defective glycoprotein, these considerations are likely moot as GP-C biogenesis appears to be otherwise blind to the SKI-1/S1P site mutation. Among the heptad-repeat mutants, we also observe no evidence for global defects in folding, assembly or transport and thereby extend the interpretation of the model experiment to these glycoproteins. Thus, we conclude that the following a and d heptad-repeat positions contribute directly to promoting pH-dependent membrane fusion by the Jun\u00edn virus envelope glycoprotein: I333, L336, I347 and L350 in the N-terminal region and R392 and W395 in the C-terminal region.",

Biophysical evidence emerging from the laboratory of M.

Similarly, broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane-proximal region of the HIV gp41 ectodomain adjacent to the C-terminal heptad repeat (Muster et al., 1993; Stiegler et al., 2001; Zwick et al., 2001) may likewise interfere in this process (Follis et al., 2002) .

(A) Amino acids of the Jun\u00edn virus envelope glycoprotein are numbered from the initiating methionine, and cysteine residues (|) and potential glycosylation sites (Y) are marked. The SSP and SKI-1/S1P cleavage sites and the resulting SSP, G1 and G2 subunits are indicated. Within G2, the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (cyto) domains are shown, as are the N-and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions (light gray shading). A comparison of heptad-repeat sequences among arenavirus species is detailed below. Sequences include the New World isolates Jun\u00edn (D10072), Tacaribe (M20304), Machupo (AY129248) and Guanarito (AAN05423) and Old World isolates Lassa-Josiah (M15076), Mopeia (M33879), LCMV-Armstrong (M20869). The 3,4 periodicity of a and d heptad-repeat positions is indicated by shading. (B) Helical wheel projections of proposed heptad-repeat periodicity. Amino acids shown above are listed in numeric order at a -g positions. A schematic of a six-helix bundle is at the lower right, and the details of the canonical interhelical packing arrangement are illustrated.",

The ability of the envelope glycoproteins to mediate pH-dependent cell -cell fusion was detected using the recombinant vaccinia virus-based h-galactosidase reporter assay (Nussbaum et al., 1994) as described in Materials and methods. h-galactosidase activity induced upon cell -cell fusion was quantitated using the chemiluminescent substrate GalactoLite Plus (Tropix). Background levels of chemiluminescence obtained from cultures treated at neutral pH were subtracted from the relative light unit (RLU) measurement, and all RLU values were then normalized to that of the wild-type GP-C control. Error bars represent T one standard deviation among 6 replicate fusion cultures. All conclusions were replicated using X-gal staining of parallel co-cultures (York et al., 2004).",
