The symptoms of noroviral gastroenteritis such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, fever, chills, myalgias and sore throat usually last for 24 to 48 h (Green et al., 2001). Although noroviruses generally cause mild to moderate gastroenteritis, it can incapacitate affected individuals in military troops on ships or in war zones (Green et al., 2001), and can be severe to life-threatening in the young, elderly and immunocompromised patients (Atmar and Estes, 2006, Dolin, 2007). Recent studies have shown that noroviral diarrhea can persist for up to 4 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002, Sakai et al., 2001) and the viruses can be excreted for up to 3 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been reported that norovirus diarrhea and shedding lasted longer than 2 years in an immunocompromised patient (Nilsson et al., 2003).",

The GI and GII noroviruses are further subdivided into genotypes GI/1\u20137 and GII/1\u201315 (Green, 2007). NV is the most studied prototype virus and is classified as GI/1 strain. In recent years, GII/4 noroviruses became predominantly associated with norovirus outbreaks and sporadic cases worldwide (Siebenga et al., 2010, Zheng et al., 2010). Overall, norovirus strains belonging to the GII are found in 75\u2013100% of sporadic cases of norovirus infections (Patel et al., 2009), and GII/4 strains account for 60\u201370% of all reported norovirus outbreaks globally (Kroneman et al., 2008, Siebenga et al., 2009).",

Noroviruses show high diversity, and immunity to one strain does not necessarily provide protection from infection with another strain. In addition, inadequate long-term immunity against noroviruses is indicated by repeated infections in adults (Glass et al., 2009, Green, 2007). Although noroviruses do not multiply in food or water, they can cause large outbreaks because as few as 10\u2013100 virions are sufficient to cause illness in a healthy adult (Green, 2007). Noroviruses are classified as NIAID category B priority pathogens (NIAID) due to their highly contagious nature and a potential to cause a serious public health challenge. Therefore, development of antiviral drugs is highly desirable for preventing and treating norovirus infections.",

The gene organization of the norovirus nonstructural polyproteins encoded by ORF1 is N-terminal protein (Nterm, NS1-2), NTPase (NS3), p22 (3A-like protein, NS4), VPg (NS5), protease (Pro, NS6), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol, NS7) (Green et al., 2001) (Fig. 1\n). Norovirus protease specifically recognizes and cleaves LQ/GP (Nterm/NTPase), LQ/GP (NTPase/p20), PE/GK (p20/VPg), FE/AP (VPg/Pro), and LE/GG (Pro/Pol) junctions to produce the mature proteins during viral replication (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Liu et al., 1999, Sosnovtsev et al., 2006). Norovirus protease is classified as 3C-like cysteine protease due to its similarity to picornavirus 3C protease, which has a catalytic triad of amino acids composed of C, H, and E or D (Green, 2007, Nakamura et al., 2005). Since norovirus protease is essential for viral replication, viral protease represents an attractive target for antiviral drug development. The design and screening of antiviral agents targeting viral protease can be greatly facilitated by the availability of an assay that is suitable for large scale screening of potential novel drugs targeting viral protease.",

In this assay system, substrates have a fluorescence donor and a quencher on each end, and the donor fluorescence signal in the uncleaved substrate is inhibited by the interaction of the fluorescence donor and quencher. Once substrates are cleaved by a protease, the donor fluorescence is no longer quenched, yielding an increase in fluorescence intensity. Addition of protease inhibitors to the assay inhibits the cleavage of the substrates, which leads to reduced fluorescence intensity, enabling screening of potential protease inhibitors. The FRET protease assay system is also a useful tool for measuring the activity and substrate specificity of a protease. So far, most of information on the proteolytic processing of the norovirus proteases has been obtained using in vitro transcription\u2013translation assay systems (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Scheffler et al., 2007, Seah et al., 1999, Someya and Takeda, 2009). Limited studies are reported on the kinetics of GI norovirus proteases using fluorogenic (Someya et al., 2008) or chromogenic substrates (Hussey et al., 2011). However studies on those of GII norovirus protease are not available. Furthermore, a FRET-based protease assay suitable as a high-throughput screening of protease inhibitors has not yet been reported for norovirus proteases of GI or GII noroviruses (Zeitler et al., 2006).",

A series of 1H\u201315N HSQC spectra of NVpro with increasing concentrations of chymostatin were analyzed to identify the residues of NVpro involved in the interaction with chymostatin. NMR chemical shift perturbations of backbone amide (1H and 15N) resonance in the 1H\u201315N HSQC spectra are sensitive probes for changes in chemical environments surrounding amino acid residues and/or in the relative populations of different conformations in protein structural ensemble (Shuker et al., 1996). The weighted chemical shift differences of 1H\u201315N resonances for NVpro in the presence of varying concentrations of chymostatin were compared to those observed in the absence of chymostatin (Fig. 7A). Significant chemical shift changes were observed during chymostatin titration in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 7A and B), indicating the specific interaction between NVpro and chymostatin. On the other hand, PB compound added as an unrelated control caused no significant chemical shift perturbation for NVpro (Fig. 7C). In the presence of 2-fold molar excess of chymostatin, the residues of NVpro that showed significantly shifts (\u0394d \u2265 0.04) were T4*, K11*, G17, T27, V31*, I49, A52*, E54, G60, L97, R100, G102, A105*, Q110*,V114*, H115*, Q117*, G119*, A141*, R147*, G133*, G137*, D138*, C139*, G140*, A141*, R147*, V152, H157*, A159, A160*, T161*, K162*, S163*, N165*, and T166*. The residues that could not be traced out due to the peak disappearance and/or line broadening are marked with asterisks and the largest positive values (\u0394d \u2265 0.15) in Fig. 7A. The line-broadening effects are likely indicative of chemical exchange on the slow time scale (\u03bcs\u2013ms) due to the conformational dynamics of NVpro interacting with chymostatin.",

            "text": "To corroborate the result obtained for NVpro-chymostatin interaction using NMR spectroscopy, we constructed a docking model for NVpro complexed with chymostatin using HADDOCK program (de Vries et al, Dominguez et al., 2003). During the docking, experimental information on the interface between NVpro and chymostatin derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation was required as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking of two molecules. Based on the NVpro chemical shift perturbation observed in the presence of chymostatin and higher solvent accessibility, T4, K11, S14, A52, K62, R65, D90, E93, L95, R100, Q110, M120, K146, R147, T161, K162, and S163 are designated as active residues in AIRs. In addition, catalytically important residues E54, G137, and C139, which displayed significant perturbation but lower solvent accessibility were also selected as active residues. H30, S91, R112, I135, and P136 adjacent to those active residues were defined as passive residues. The positions of the active and passive residues for NVpro are indicated on the structure (Figs. 8A and B). As a result of the docking calculation, several different clusters with similar HADDOCK score were obtained. For all those clusters, it is indicated that chymostatin is positioned near the active and substrate binding sites of NVpro. The structural ensemble in the lowest energy cluster has RMSD value of 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 over all backbone atoms. The representative structure of the lower energy cluster is presented in Fig. 8. The structure has favorable energy values, van der Waals energy of \u2212 27.1 kcal mol\u2212 1 and electrostatic energy of \u2212 145.3 kcal mol\u2212 1, but higher restraint violation energy of 169.9 kcal mol\u2212 1. This higher violation is mostly due to our unbiased selection of active residues showing chemical shift perturbation. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, several residues do not have any direct interactions with chymostatin (T4, K11, K62, R65, S91, E93, L95, R100, M120, K146, and R147). It is highly probable that those residues distant from the binding site were indirectly affected and experienced a certain degree of conformational changes upon binding of chymostatin. The docking model depicted in Fig. 8 demonstrates that chymostatin bound to NVpro in a canonical substrate binding mode as also suggested by NMR data; NVpro-chymostatin interactions occur mainly in C-terminal domain and an arch formed by two \u03b2-sheets, \u03b2II and cII, covers the chymostatin.",

Norovirus infection causes debilitating illness in people of all age groups at military bases, as well as in cruise ships, schools, and hospitals. Noroviruses require only a few viral particles to initiate infection and are highly contagious. Moreover, long-lasting immunity following natural infection rarely develops in people. Considering these challenges, antiviral drugs for controlling norovirus infections are in urgent need. Norovirus protease is known to be responsible for critical virus-mediated post-translational cleavages of the polypeptide encoding the viral proteins. Therefore, inhibition of the viral protease has the capacity to prevent viral replication. There are several viral protease inhibitors on the market or under development for pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and SARS coronavirus (Ghosh et al., 2007, Kazmierski et al., 2006, Tsantrizos, 2008, Walker et al., 2003). Robust and reliable assays for high throughput screening of potential norovirus protease inhibitors can greatly facilitate the development of antiviral drugs against the viral protease.",

However, the amino acid sequence analysis showed that the key residues of the catalytic site and residues forming the S1 subsite are conserved in GI and GII noroviruses (Ng and Parra, 2010). A co-transcription and translation assay study using MD145 ORF1 on the enzymatic activity of MD145 (GII) protease suggested that substrate specificity requirements are similar to those for NV (GI) based on western blots and radioactive microsequencing mapping (Belliot et al., 2003). However, there is little information on the comparative kinetic properties of proteases from GI and GII noroviruses. Therefore, we developed a FRET protease assay with high-throughput capability to use for screening of norovirus protease inhibitors, and study the substrate and inhibitor specificities of norovirus proteases of GI and GII noroviruses.",

In our study, MD145pro cleaved the substrates spanning P7\u2013P7\u2032 or P5\u2013P2\u2032 residues from the NS2/3 cleavage site of NV with an efficiency similar to NVpro, indicating that MD145pro recognized and cleaved the substrates with H and F in P3 and P4 positions, respectively, as efficiently as NVpro. In addition, NVpro and MD145pro cleaved the substrate with P5\u2013P2\u2032 residues more efficiently than substrate with P7\u2013P7\u2032 residues, suggesting that P3\u2032\u2013P7\u2032 and P6\u2013P7 residues are not necessary for substrate binding and cleavage by both proteases. These results are in line with an earlier report that p-nitroaniline peptide with P5\u2013P1 residues was most efficiently cleaved by GI protease (Southampton strain) compared to those containing P6\u2013P1 or P4\u2013P1 residues, and the substrate of P3\u2013P1 residues was not cleaved (Hussey et al., 2011). In addition, Chiba virus protease (GI)-substrate complex modeling based on crystal structure suggested that the substrate binding is stabilized by interactions of substrate residues P5\u2013P2 to the corresponding binding sites of the protease (Nakamura et al., 2005).",

Norovirus protease is structurally similar to the chymotrypsin superfamily based on X-ray crystallography (Nakamura et al., 2005, Zeitler et al., 2006). The standard protease inhibitors share a common mechanism of action, although they do not share the primary sequence for the three-dimensional structures (Bode and Huber, 1992, Laskowski and Kato, 1980). The screening of protease inhibitors in our assay revealed that the activities of both proteases were significantly inhibited by the presence of chymostatin and TPCK. Detailed kinetic studies of the inhibition of NVpro and MD145pro by chymostatin confirmed that both proteases have similar inhibition profiles, suggesting that protease inhibitors may be developed against multiple norovirus genogroups. In addition, the versatility of the assay allows incorporation of proteases from different genogroups so that screening of compounds against various norovirus genogroups can be performed. The quality and suitability of the FRET assay for high throughput screening were demonstrated by high Z factor of 0.86.",

The analysis of NMR chemical shift mapping data revealed that the resonances of residues that are involved in substrate binding sites or active sites are greatly affected. Chymostatin that exhibited strong inhibitory effects against both proteases contains G\u2013L\u2013F moiety. Previous structural studies on the interaction of chymotrypsin and serine standard protease inhibitors showed that side chain of the P1 residue (F) of chymostatin fits into the specificity subsite of chymotrypsin, and the carbonyl oxygen extends toward the oxyanion hole formed by the G and S residues located in the active site of the enzyme. The P1\u2013P3 residues of chymostatin also interact with the enzyme by forming a short, anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet interaction (Coombs et al., 1999). These interactions represent a substrate-like binding mode for enzymes. Our docking results using HADDOCK based on NMR chemical shift perturbation study indicate that chymostatin specifically interacts with NVpro in a canonical binding mode that can be seen in the protease-substrate/substrate-directed inhibitor complexes. At this stage we are not able to give a clear answer for whether chymostatin covalently modifies the nucleophilic thiol group and forms hemithioacetal adduct or forms non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. However our results indicate that critical residues for the catalysis are targeted by chymostatin.",

The mutant NVpro with C (nucleophile) to A substitution at position 139 (C139A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All proteins were monomers with a size of approximately 20 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 9\n), which is in contrast to previous reports that norovirus proteases stably formed a dimer (NVpro) or were predominantly dimeric in solution (Southampton virus protease) (Hussey et al., 2011, Zeitler et al., 2006). Interestingly, our preliminary x-ray crystallography revealed NVpro as dimers, suggesting that the His-tag at the N-terminus does not interfere with dimerization (data not shown).

All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), and analyzed with Sparky (Goddard and Kneller, 2006) and CARA software (http://www.nmr.ch) (Keller, 2004). Inhibitor titration experiments were carried out by direct addition of 10 mM stock solution of chymostatin dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) into uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro solution. 2D 1H\u201315N HSQC spectra of NVpro were monitored during addition of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 M equivalents of chymostatin. Complex points 1024 \u00d7 128 and spectral widths of 14 \u00d7 38 ppm were used to record all the spectra. Recently we have reported a total of 94% of the backbone 1H and 15N resonance assignments of free NVpro (Takahashi et al., 2011). The assignment of the HSQC spectra in the presence of chymostatin was used to investigate the interaction with the inhibitor by following the peak shifts during titration. Since the use of DMSO-d6 as a co-solvent caused a slight but traceable resonance peak shifts in dose-dependent manner, the titrations were repeated with DMSO-d6 alone. Each spectrum with varying amount of chymostatin was compared with that of DMSO-d6 at a corresponding titration point. As a control, similar experiments were repeated using an unrelated compound dissolved in DMSO-d6 that does not inhibit NVpro activity (PB compound). Chemical shift changes were characterized using a weighted chemical shift difference (\u0394\u03b4 \u2212 [1/2{\u03b4H\n2\n + 1/25\u03b4N\n2}]1/2) (Grzesiek et al., 1996).",

Protein residues directly involved in intermolecular interaction are defined as \u201cactive residues\u201d, while neighboring residues of active residues as \u201cpassive residues\u201d. HADDOCK docking protocols consist of three-stage procedure, a rigid-body energy minimization, a semi-flexible refinement in torsion angle space and a final refinement in explicit solvent. Crystal structure of NVpro (PDB code: 2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) was used as the starting structure. NVpro residues showing peak disappearance or chemical shift perturbation greater than the average shift value, 0.019 ppm, in 1H\u201315N HSQC spectrum of NVpro with chymostatin and possessing higher solvent accessibility were selected as active residues. Solvent accessibility was calculated using GETAREA (Robert Fraczkiewicz, 1998), where residues are defined as solvent exposed when the ratio of side-chain surface area to its random coil value exceeds 50%. All solvent accessible surface neighbors of active residues were then defined as passive residues in the docking calculation. Whole residues of the small ligand, chymostatin, were selected as active residues. Initially, a total of 1000 structures were calculated at the rigid body minimization stage. From this calculation, the 200 lowest-energy structures were then selected for the subsequent semi-flexible simulated annealing and the refinement in explicit solvent. The final structures were clustered using the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with a cutoff of 7.5 \u00c5. All the structures were drawn with the PyMol (DeLano).",
