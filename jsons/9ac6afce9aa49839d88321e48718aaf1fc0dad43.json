Fusion-resistant L-2 cell mutants had similar cholesterol and fatty acid composition as did their fusion-susceptible parent subclone, and were presumably deficient in a genetically mutable non-lipid, host cell factor (e.g., fusion protein receptor). On the other hand, cellular sensitivity to virus fusion, which is known to be influenced by cell cholesterol content [Daya et al., 19881 , was shown further to be modulated by homeostatic alterations in fatty acid metabolism. Cholesterol supplementation of mouse L-2 fibroblasts or of peritoneal macrophages from MHVsusceptible mice elevated susceptibility to viral fusion. Increased fusion susceptibility occurred in cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells in the absence of any detectable alterations i n host cell fatty acid composition, thus demonstrating fusion enhancement by cholesterol alone. L-2 cells cloned by limiting dilution in normal (not cholesterol-supplemented) medium were found to be heterogeneous i n cholesterol content. Interestingly, high cholesterol-containing subclones had increased levels of C-18:0, C-18:2, C-20:4, and C-22:6 and markedly reduced levels of C-18:l fatty acids when compared to low cholesterol-containing subclones. High cholesterolcontaining subclones did not show enhanced susceptibility to viral fusion, suggesting that homeostatic alteration of fatty acid metabolism compensated for the increased cholesterol levels and countered the normally fusion-enhancing effect of cholesterol alone. Since these observations have potentially important consequences regarding the effects of dietary cholesterol on the severity of virus infection, we examined liver titres and pathology of normal and hypercholesterolemic mice infected with MHV.

The present study also underscores the importance of determining membrane cholesterol levels in addition to fatty acid composition, the latter of which might otherwise be considered to be the major determinant of susceptibility to viral-induced fusion [Roos et al., 19901. Given the demonstrated fusion-modulating roles of membrane cholesterol and fatty acid, it is important to realize that these lipid constituents do not account for all instances of variations in fusion susceptibility.

This may be due to the fact that cell fusion is not an outstanding feature of MHV-induced hepatitis.

Moreover, as documented in the present study there is clear evidence for two important homeostatic mechanisms which would be expected to diminish the effects of excess cholesterol on liver cell membrane function (and virusmediated membrane cytopathology). Thus, while liver cholesterol levels were considerably elevated in mice given the cholesterol diet, most of the cholesterol was found as the esterified form. The cholesterol would therefore be mainly sequestered in lipid storage droplets within the cytoplasm rather than accumulated in the cell membranes. In addition, the increased incorporation of cholesterol into the livers of cholesterolsupplemented mice was accompanied by alterations in fatty acid composition, specifically raising the unsaturated fatty acid content, thereby counteracting the normally rigidifying effect of cholesterol.
