Their genomes range from approximately 26\u201332 kb in size (Jung et al., 2016; Jung and Saif, 2015). The family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales is divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Bats are the projected host reservoir for Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses, while birds are the suspect host for Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses (Jung et al., 2016; Jung and Saif, 2015). Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (genus Alphacoronavirus) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (genus Deltacoronavirus) share similar clinical and pathological features, including acute diarrhea, dehydration and mortality in neonatal piglets (Jung et al., 2016; Jung and Saif, 2015).",

            "text": "For the last four decades since the first discovery of PEDV in 1977, PEDV has been found only within the pig population (Jung and Saif, 2015). However, PDCoV-induced pig diarrhea recently emerged in the United States in 2014 (Jung et al., 2016). PDCoV is a novel enteropathogenic coronavirus in pigs and was previously reported in wild birds, although the mechanisms of interspecies transmission of deltacoronaviruses between pigs and birds are unclear (Jung et al., 2016). PDCoV may be incompletely adapted to pigs and as such may have a capacity to infect different animal species (Jung et al., 2016), as also suggested by previous in vitro or in vivo observations (Boley et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2019). Our previous in vivo study also revealed that gnotobiotic calves were susceptible to infection with the newly emerging PDCoV, but not with PEDV (Jung et al., 2017). In prior studies, we isolated various primary cells from gnotobiotic calves to test growth of the GIII.2 bovine norovirus strain CV186-OH that did not grow in regular bovine cell lines (Oka et al., 2018). Additionally, two different primary bovine cells, morphologically and molecularly (vimentin-positive, but E-Cadherin-negative) similar to mesenchymal cells, were isolated and successfully propagated in vitro. Therefore, we attempted to use the two primary bovine cell types to investigate: i) whether they are also susceptible to infection with the cell culture-adapted PDCoV OH-FD22, but not with the cell culture-adapted PEDV PC22-P40, similar to the previous in vivo observations in gnotobiotic calves (Jung et al., 2017); ii) if or how in vitro observations from bovine cells coincide with the in vivo counterparts from gnotobiotic calves; and iii) based on that, to which extent the cell culture-based observations may be useful to predict the corresponding in vivo expectations.",

However, the observation is discrepant with the in vivo data from gnotobiotic calves inoculated orally with a similar strain of PEDV (Jung et al., 2017). The previous study revealed that PDCoV-inoculated gnotobiotic calves developed acute subclinical infection without histologic lesions and no detectable PDCoV antigen in the intestines and other major organs, including kidney and heart, but with persisting fecal viral RNA shedding and seroconversion (Jung et al., 2017). On the other hand, no PEDV-inoculated gnotobiotic calves exhibited fecal virus shedding, seroconversion, histopathology or detectable PEDV antigens in the corresponding tissues.

            "text": "Relative to PEDV, PDCoV is a novel enteropathogenic CoV in pigs (Jung et al., 2016). PDCoV may be incompletely adapted to pigs and as such may have a capacity to infect different animal species, such as calves, chickens, and turkeys (Boley et al., 2020; Jung et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2019). Our previous in vitro study demonstrated that a variety of cell lines of different animal species or organs origin were susceptible to infection with PDCoV, including human (Huh7 and human cervical cancer cells, HeLa), monkey (African green monkey kidney cells, Vero-CCL81), avian (chicken embryo fibroblast cells, DF-1), and canine (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, MDCK), implicating its zoonotic or interspecies transmission potential (Li et al., 2018). We also identified aminopeptidase N (APN) as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV in the variety of cells of the different animal species origin. Structural analyses of the APN ectodomain revealed four independently folded domains, termed domains I through IV (Chen et al., 2012), which were highly conserved among different animal species, including bovine (Bos tarus) (Li et al., 2018). Therefore, similar to the cells of human, monkey, avian or canine origin that permitted PDCoV infection (Li et al., 2018), the spike 1 protein of PDCoV also seemed to engage APN via the conserved domain II for entry into the primary bovine cells of kidney or heart origin. However, it is noteworthy that in our previous in vivo study, no PDCoV-inoculated calves exhibited PDCoV antigen in the small and large intestines, kidney, or heart (Jung et al., 2017). On the other hand, the mechanisms by which PEDV entered into the primary bovine cells remain unknown as does the receptor for PEDV.",

            "text": "Our previous study revealed limited infectivity of PDCoV in gnotobiotic calves (Jung et al., 2017), and likewise, in our subsequent studies, we found that gnotobiotic calf-passaged strains of PDCoV had no increased infectivity in gnotobiotic calves after serial calf passage, indicating incomplete adaptation of the virus to calves. Therefore, in our current study, we further attempted to verify if the previous in vivo finding could present an abortive infection with PDCoV in gnotobiotic calves. However, we did not verify which primary bovine mesenchymal cell type was more susceptible to PDCoV or PEDV, by comparing the infectivity and replication rates between the two cell types. Our current study demonstrated that PDCoV or PEDV previously grown in other swine or monkey cell cultures such as LLC-PK or Vero cells, respectively, can infect and replicate in vitro in primary bovine mesenchymal cells. Compared with PDCoV RNA titers, ranging from 8.2 to 9.3 log10 GE/mL, in the cell culture supernatants of PBK or PBH cells treated with 1.25\u20132.5 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin at 18\u221242 hpi, higher PEDV RNA titers, ranging from 11.6 to 13.0 log10 GE/mL, were observed in the cell culture supernatants of PBK or PBH cells treated with 2.5\u22125 \u03bcg/mL of trypsin during the same period. The higher PEDV RNA titers might be a result of greater replication and release of PEDV in the PBK or PBH cells treated with the higher concentrations of trypsin, although the detailed mechanisms need to be investigated further. In addition, supplementation of 1.25\u20132.5 \u03bcg/ml and 2.5\u22125.0 \u03bcg/mL of trypsin in the cell culture maintenance medium for PDCoV and PEDV, respectively, appeared to be beneficial for both viral growth and induction of CPE in the two primary bovine cell types, although further studies are needed to confirm the absolute necessity of trypsin in the cell culture maintenance medium for PDCoV and PEDV replication. The results were similar to the beneficial effect of the exogenous trypsin on both growth and induction of CPE of these two viruses in the pig or monkey cell lines (Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2018; Oka et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2017).",

However, further studies are still needed to investigate whether bovine intestinal epithelial cells are also susceptible to PDCoV and PEDV.",
