Children with documented bacterial co-infections (including bacteremia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, acute gastroenteritis, or any bacterial pathogen isolated from a sterile site) or viral co-infections were excluded from the study.

Lastly, to exclude viral co-infections, respiratory samples were tested by viral culture or PCR in 94% of patients and controls. influenza strains, and collected whole blood samples at 8 hours intervals after inoculation. Symptoms were recorded twice daily using a modified standardized symptom score, called the modified Jackson Score, which requires subjects to rank symptoms of upper respiratory infection (stuffy nose, scratchy throat, headache, cough, etc) on a scale of 0-3 of ''no symptoms'', ''just noticeable'', ''bothersome but can still do activities'' and ''bothersome and cannot do daily activities''. For all cohorts, modified Jackson scores were tabulated to determine if subjects became symptomatic from the respiratory viral challenge. Symptom onset was defined as the first of 2 contiguous days with score of 2 or more. A modified Jackson score of \u22656 over a consecutive five day period was the primary indicator of symptomatic viral infection and subjects with this score and a positive qualitative viral culture or quantitative RT-PCR for at least 2 consecutive days (beginning 24 hours after inoculation) were denoted as ''symptomatic infection''.
