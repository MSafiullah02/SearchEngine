The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) infection and epidemic waves of avian influenza A(H7N9) since their emergence in 2012 and 2013, respectively, have raised global concern in recent years. The huge clinical burden of common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza, on healthcare resources and utilization highlights the importance for developing more effective treatment modalities in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. In this contemporary concise review, articles related to these common respiratory infections and TB published recently in Respirology and selected articles published in other journals that highlight advances in knowledge are summarized.",

In a 1:1 propensity score\u2010matched analysis of data from a longitudinal health insurance database in Taiwan, Lin et al. showed 76% reduction in TB risk among 5026 diabetic patients put on metformin as compared with 5026 non\u2010metformin users, after adjusting for co\u2010morbidities, diabetic complications, anti\u2010diabetic therapy type and statin use.41 In another longitudinal study from the same locality,42 metformin users were associated with 44% reduction in mortality during TB treatment despite their higher haemoglobin A1c level. The protective effect of metformin therefore appears independent of diabetic control. While the sizeable protective effects of metformin in the above\u2010mentioned studies suggest a potential role of the drug as host\u2010directed therapy in the treatment of latent TB infection and active TB, randomized trials are need to delineate its exact role(s) before introduction into clinical practices.43 Park et al. retrospectively reviewed the data of 1784 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the Korean COPD Subtype Study cohort.44 The COPD assessment test (CAT) scores, total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQc) scores and exacerbation prevalence were significantly higher, and lung function was significantly poorer in COPD patients with prior TB than those without, both at the baseline and on follow\u2010up over 3 years. Poorer lung function was observed among patients with prior TB, irrespective of whether they had visible lung lesions on chest radiographs.",

However, with the high global burden of latent TB Infection, vaccines capable of preventing pulmonary TB in infected individuals will be needed to reduce TB incidence quickly.27 At least 12 novel TB vaccine candidates are now in clinical trials.52 A subunit vaccine, M72/AS01E, showed 54% protection against active pulmonary TB in HIV\u2010negative adults with a positive IGRA in a recent phase IIb trial.53 This proof\u2010of\u2010concept study brings fresh hopes for new and possibly transformative TB vaccines in the near future.",
