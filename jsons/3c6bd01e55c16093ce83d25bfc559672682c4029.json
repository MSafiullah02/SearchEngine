Radiological imaging often confirms the diagnosis and allows the evaluation of the location and extent of infection. Chest radiography is the primary imaging procedure and the starting point for the evaluation of all children with acute chest disease. Accurate interpretation of pediatric chest films also requires a basic understanding of the physiologic and anatomic differences among adults, neonates, and infants and their most important differences will be referred. Characterization of pulmonary infiltrates is important, because patterns of abnormality suggest specific organisms and aetiologies. Although providing evidence suggestive of the causative agent, the chest radiograph cannot confirm viral infection, confirm or exclude bacterial etiology. In fact, in infancy, pneumonia usually produces a combination of alterations of the airspace and interstitium. However, some aspects may be useful in distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia. Close attention to CT technique is crucial for imaging evaluation of pneumonia in pediatric patients, namely those with persistent symptoms and/or progressive symptoms despite medical or surgical therapy, or in immunocompromised patients. CT with low radiation dose technique should be carefully performed in these cases. CT examination with IV contrast is very useful for the evaluation of complications of chest infection. Thoracic trauma in children is rare, only 4-6 % of children are hospitalized following severe trauma. Only a small number of children with trauma have thoracic injury (14 %), but the injuries tend to be of serious nature. About 25-50 % of thoracic trauma cases occur in combination with other trauma locations. Pulmonary contusion and lacerations, tracheobronchial injuries, pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are referred as",

US has been advocated as an important initial aid in categorizing the pleural fluid (simple and complicated), and making therapeutic decisions for parapneumonic effusions, acute complication of pneumonia. US can also be used to provide imaging guidance for pleural fluid drainage, especially when is loculated. US is very useful initially to study patients presenting with an opaque hemithorax on plain film. Patients with lung consolidation associated to pleural fluid can be initially evaluated at the same time by US. Color and power Doppler can analyze the perfusion of the lung parenchyma. It could be well vascularized and poorly vascularized with or without necrosis. Initially, US can provide diagnostic and prognostic information which may influence therapy.",

For these reasons, the peripheral airways of infants are more susceptible to inflammatory narrowing than adult airways. In older children and adults, respiratory infections most commonly involve the interstitium and alveoli. Lower respiratory infections in infants, on the other hand, manifest their primary effects in the smaller airways, producing peripheral mucous obstruction and disproportionately severe respiratory distress. This is revealed on the chest films by generalized hyperaeration (air trapping) with focal irregularities of aeration that reflects atelectasis from mucous plugging. True consolidative (alveolar) pneumonia is a much less frequent occurrence (Wesenberg et al. 2006 ).",

The characteristic CT finding of pulmonary laceration is the presence of an air-or fluid-filled cavity (Fig. 21) . Lacerations result from penetrating injuries, such as adjacent displaced rib fractures, or shearing blunt forces to the lung. Initially, they may be indistinguishable from surrounding contusion. Because of the disruption of the lung tissue, one or more air cavities develop over time and may contain a central density or fluid level because of intrapulmonary hematoma. Pulmonary lacerations tend to heal more slowly than contusions, and, especially in children, they may leave behind a persistent cavity called a posttraumatic pulmonary pseudocyst (Westra and Wallace 2005) .",
