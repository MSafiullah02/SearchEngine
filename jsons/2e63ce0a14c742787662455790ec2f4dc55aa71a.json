It contains an aromatic p-aminoacetophenone moiety that is formed from chorismic acid via p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA); PABA synthetase converts chorismic acid into PABA using glutamine as an amino donor 7 \u2022 The enzyme itself has been purified and has a molecular weight of 50 kilodaltons by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein contains about 370 amino acids, requiring a DNA coding sequence of 1.1 kb. P ABA-synthetase is present in S. griseus only during the antibiotic production phase 8 .

One of these clones contained a hybrid plasmid that had two Bam HI fragments, 4.5 and 3.9 kb long, inserted in the Bam HI site of piJ41.

A reasonable cell density for an Escherichia coli fermentation is about six percent wet weight (higher densities can be achieved with some yeasts). It is usually advantageous to remove about 90 percent of the culture liquid and concentrate the cells to about 40 percent, particularly if the next processing step is mechanical disruption of the cells. At the present time, the most common way to concentrate cells is by continuous high speed centrifugation. There are several types of centrifugal separators. Commercially available nozzle-type separators have a solids handling capacity of up to 60,000 liters/hour. Smaller stack separators which discharge intermittently through axial channels can process up to 250 liters/hour at relatively high centrifugal forces (I4,000 g). \u00b7 The same authors discussed the problems encountered in large-scale separations using centrifugation. They pointed out that the useful feed rate depends on the sedimentation velocity of the smallest particles to be removed. For example, the relatively small size of most bacteria reduces the throughput of an \u00a3. coli culture to only 6 percent of the throughput of a yeast culture.",
