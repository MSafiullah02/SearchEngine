The complete blood picture revealed a normal total white cell count of 4.40 \u00d7 109/L; however, there were neutropenia (0.53 \u00d7 109/L, normal range 2.2\u20136.7 \u00d7 109/L), lymphocytosis (3.48 \u00d7 109/L, normal range 1.2\u20133.4 \u00d7 109/L) and thrombocytopenia with platelet of 56 \u00d7 109/L (normal range 170\u2013380 \u00d7 109/L). A review of the blood smear showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes (0.13 \u00d7 109/L, normal range 0), and there was no platelet clumping (\nFig. 1a). The liver parenchymal enzymes were deranged with elevation of alanine aminotransferase (56 U/L, normal range 6\u201353 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (46 U/L, normal range 13\u201333 U/L), but the gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and the renal function tests were within normal limits. In view of the abnormal blood picture, flow cytometry studies were performed the next day, which demonstrated a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.3 suggestive of a reactive change due to viral infection. Extensive microbiological investigations for MLI were performed on the same day. Serum for heterophil antibodies by Monospot test was negative. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) serology showed a past infection with positive EBNA and VCA IgG. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG was positive but the IgM was negative. The CMV pp65 antigenemia was negative. The serum HIV antibody, toxoplasma and parvovirus IgM and IgG were also negative.",
