These envelope proteins mediate both the initial virion attachment to the cell and the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in the release of the viral contents into the host cell (Eckert & Kim, 2001b) . As with other enveloped RNA viruses including the coronaviruses, genome sequencing reveals that SARS-CoV envelope spike (S) protein contains highly conserved heptadrepeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which have been shown to be important in virus membrane fusion. Such heptad-repeat regions have been successfully used as targets for virus entry/ fusion inhibitors in a number of viruses (Chan & Kim, 1998; Eckert & Kim, 2001b) . It is generally believed that the envelope protein undergoes a series of conformational changes during the virus-fusion process. The HR1 and HR2 regions are believed to be important modules/domains in this process and show different conformations in different fusion states (Eckert & Kim, 2001b) . In the current model, there are at least three conformational states of the envelope fusion protein: the prefusion native state, the pre-hairpin intermediate state and the post-fusion hairpin state (Chan et al., 1997; Eckert & Kim, 2001b) . During these state transitions, HR1 and HR2 are exposed in an intermediate conformational state but bind to each other to form a coiledcoil structure in the post-fusion state. Therefore, the in vitro introduced HR peptides compete with their endogenous HR counterparts in the intermediate state, preventing the transition into the formation of HR1/HR2 coiled-coil bundle in the post-fusion state.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 320, "text": "(Eckert & Kim, 2001b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 705, "end": 723, "text": "(Chan & Kim, 1998;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 724, "end": 744, "text": "Eckert & Kim, 2001b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1042, "text": "(Eckert & Kim, 2001b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1262, "text": "(Chan et al., 1997;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1283, "text": "Eckert & Kim, 2001b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Some HR peptides or analogues have been shown to be potent inhibitors of virus fusion (Eckert & Kim, 2001a,b; Root et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 86, "end": 109, "text": "(Eckert & Kim, 2001a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 110, "end": 128, "text": "Root et al., 2001)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Membrane fusion is the key step in enveloped virus infection.
