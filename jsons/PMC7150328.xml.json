However, significant health gains can only occur when the fidelity with which medical advances are delivered is optimized. These two processes can sometimes be seen as competing (Woolf and Johnson, 2005), but in actuality represent two factors necessary for medical progress. There may be no area where this is more clearly demonstrated than in translational diagnostics, a field driven by innovation (Ratner, 2006). The implementation of genomics and other innovative diagnostics for personalized medicine requires the translation of a vast array of technologies and therapeutic strategies from basic science to clinical application.

Just a few years ago, academic medical centers were the primary mechanism to foster translational research and facilitate collaboration between researchers and clinicians (Puderbaugh, 2006). Multidisciplinary educational programs were funded primarily by private institutions, such as the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (Mankoff et al., 2004). In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then began initiatives to identify, finance, and develop translational research programs. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research aimed to identify and support research beyond the scope of any single NIH component (NIH, 2006). Roadmap initiatives sought to improve the development and availability of modern scientific tools and information resources, foster novel methods of research collaboration, and enhance the nation's clinical research enterprise. The NIH funded the first 12 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) in 2006 for academic centers conducting projects on translational research (NCRR, 2006); additional centers are being named in subsequent years.",

Molecular diagnostic applications of microarray technology include cancer diagnosis, typing, and prognosis; infectious disease identification, biodefense applications, and pharmacogenomics (Petrik, 2006). Another application of array technology is array comparative genome hybridization. This is a powerful technique that detects high-level amplification and homozygous deletions in small genomic regions. Array technology has been used to detect highresolution copy number changes in breast, renal, and bladder cancer (Gabriele et al., 2006; Petrik, 2006). Using the genomic clone sequence data, this technique can lead quickly to the identification and cloning of genes associated with disease for use in diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Array technology promises to revolutionize the field of medical cytogenetics by providing molecular karyotyping without the need to culture cells or stain chromosomes for visualization (see Chapter 9).",

The human genome project identified approximately 25,000 human genes. However, it is estimated that the number of protein products is 10\u201330 times higher due to alternative splicing and post-translational modification of gene products (Petrik, 2006). Proteomics also encompasses protein expression profiles as a function of age, state, and environment. The basic technique of proteomics is the separation of proteins from a biological sample by various separation technologies (2-D PAGE, liquid chromatography, affinity capture) followed by detection of proteins peptide fragments by technologies such as peptide fingerprinting by mass spectrometry, protein arrays, or antibody arrays (Rice et al., 2006). Proteomic analysis based on mass spectrometry may be better suited for the identification of useful protein biomarkers, while technologies such as automated chip technology using protein arrays may have higher clinical diagnostic utility. Protein arrays use protein probes that in solution retain the ability to interact specifically with other proteins or molecules. Protein arrays can be used to identify protein\u2014protein interactions, enzyme\u2014substrate interactions, and antibody\u2014antigen interactions.",

As with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), quantifying the viral load of a wide variety of viral pathogens is needed to monitor both the progression of the disease and the response to therapy. Pathogen genotyping is also essential in order to identify variants resistant to therapy, and to differentiate closely-related species or viral types. Currently, the gold standard for pathogen detection is growth of the pathogen in culture. This process is time-consuming and in many cases non-informative. Diagnostic methods for viral detection consist primarily of immunological identification of antibodies produced in response to viral infection. Molecular diagnostics utilizing nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) have been used for viral load monitoring and genotyping for HIV and screening for HIV1, hepatitis B and C (HBV, HCV), and West Nile virus (WNV) (Paxton, 2004). In HIV and HCV there is a window between infection and detection of antibody production in which immunological methods fail to detect viral infection. This is a very important issue for blood safety and for the identification of acute infections which may account for a high percentage of new clinical cases. NAAT testing has been implemented for blood screening and has been estimated to prevent about five HIV-1 and 56 HCV infections per year. Another advantage of NAAT testing lies with the flexibility of the platform in the face of emerging infectious disease threats. When WNV became a public health concern in 2002, these platforms were converted for the detection and monitoring of WNV within 9 months.",

Recently, a protein microarray for Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, has been tested and found to distinguish between SARS and other Corona viruses (Zhu et al., 2006). Low-density microarray tests are being researched for use in subtyping influenza A and avian type H5N1. These types of arrays may soon have clinical utility for monitoring influenza worldwide, developing vaccines, and eventually for point of care applications (Mehlmann et al., 2007). This last application is very important, as determining the presence of influenza on solely clinical grounds is very difficult due to poor specificity and sensitivity of clinical findings, the other pathogens that cause similar symptoms, and the influenza subtypes that cause different symptoms. For example, up to 70% of patients with influenza symptoms are not infected with influenza virus, and up to 30% of those are due to Coronaviruses (Montalto, 2003; Brown, 2006). CombiMatrix has developed a DNA microarray to detect and type influenza strains and Tm Bioscience Corp. (now Luminex) has developed a major human respiratory virus array. Molecular diagnostics can be utilized for sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia trachomitis and Nisseria gonorrhea, as well as other bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophilia (Legionnaire's disease), Borrelia burgdoreri (Lyme disease), Mycobacterium tuberculosis; and Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis (whooping cough). Despite effective vaccination programs, Bordetella pertussis remains an important and highly contagious disease due to the fact that newborns do not appear to gain passive maternal protection and vaccine-induced immunity is far less complete than expected. A real-time PCR assay that accurately detects and differentiates the DNA from both agents of pertussis syndromes has been developed (Vincart et al., 2007). This real-time PCR assay provides results within 24 h of sample receipt and provides clinicians with more timely and accurate information than that provided by culture, direct fluorescence antibody, serological testing, or even conventional PCR methods. Additional applications include tissue product testing, bioterrorism monitoring, and characterization of host\u2014pathogen interactions in the search for additional diagnostic biomarkers.",

However, these tests are neither sensitive nor specific enough to differentiate patients who will respond to treatment from those who will not. The application of high-throughput DNA array technologies, which provide gene expression profiles, has revolutionized tumor diagnostics and led to the identification of novel tumor subgroups for otherwise indistinguishable tumors (Dietel and Sers, 2006). Researchers have also identified genes the expression of which can be used to predict the metastatic potential of breast carcinomas. In the future, technologies that take a systems approach will be needed to identify patients who will benefit from novel therapies. These methods must be capable of detecting multiple oncogenic pathways in tumors both before and during therapy and they must be adaptable to routine clinical diagnostic testing. Possible methods include: tissue microarrays; forward-phase protein microarrays, capable of simultaneously detecting multiple protein interactions with a single sample; and reverse-phase protein microarrays, capable of probing multiple analytes with specific antibodies (Gulmann et al., 2006).

Genetic variation in the genes encoding metabolic enzymes leads to differences in enzyme activity that can be characterized as extensive (standard dosage), intermediate (slower than extensive, altered dosage), poor (enzyme deficiency, do not treat with some drugs), and ultrarapid (break down drugs faster than extensive, no effect or reduced effectiveness from drug therapy). One class of metabolic enzymes is the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP) that comprises more than 40 isozymes. These enzymes metabolize a large number of drugs, small molecules, mutagens, and carcinogens by modifying parent molecule functional groups. Polymorphisms in the gene CYP2D6 can result in a homozygous recessive inactive genotype that cannot convert codeine into the active metabolite morphine (Rabinowitz and Poljak, 2003). In 2005, the FDA-approved Roche Diagnostic's AmpliChip CYP450 test, a P450 molecular array which detects mutations in both the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes, which contribute to the metabolism of about a quarter of all prescribed drugs. The data provided by the AmpliChip aids physicians in determining drug selection and dosage. An example of the potential impact of CYP450 typing is illustrated by the drug warfarin which is metabolized by enzymes encoded by the gene CYP2C9. Polymorphisms in this gene influence warfarin dosing requirements and warfarin-associated bleeding (Wittkowsky, 2002). It has been demonstrated that the maintenance warfarin dose can be estimated from demographic, clinical, and pharmacogenetic factors (Gage et al., 2004). A second gene, VKORC1, has been associated with the average weekly warfarin dose required to maintain patients at their desired anticoagulation target. With more information it is expected that predictive models for warfarin dosing can be developed and help the more than one million patients which each year take warfarin at appropriate dosage to avoid thromboembolic events (Li et al., 2006). Twelve percent of those users currently experience major bleeding episodes and death results in as many as 2%.",

Use of HLA-B*5701 genotype screening has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of abacavir hyper-sensitivity through the exclusion of patients positive for this allele from abacavir combination treatment (Mallal et al., 2008). Adoption of this pharmacogenomic test was impacted by drug safety issues and the demonstration of its cost-effectiveness (Hughes et al., 2004).

This activity affects intracellular signaling pathways that result in unregulated cell proliferation. Molecular diagnosis of CML utilizes quantitative PCR.

The HNPCC syndrome predisposes a person to developing colon cancer at a young age. Presymptomatic and pre-dispositional testing in families have been conducted. Since approximately 90% of tumors from HNPCC patients show microsatellite instability, testing for this phenomenon alone can be a good guide to the necessity for further molecular characterization. Gene sequencing can be used to identify the precise mutation. Mutational data, along with DNA microsatellite instability testing results, can be used to identify first-degree relatives with HNPCC. Once HNPCC has been implicated from clinical data, immunohistochemistry testing can be conducted on tumor tissue for confirmation of diagnosis.

The symptoms could be affected, but there was no antibiotic equivalent for treating viral diseases. However, by the mid-1990s, pharmaceutical companies had a number of antiviral compounds; some specifically tailored to HIV, well into clinical trials and needed an accurate biomarker to analyze effectiveness of the new therapies. This convergence of therapeutics and diagnostics would lead to the birth of the theranostic, a diagnostic test linked to the application of specific therapies (Warner, 2004). In 1996, Roche Diagnostics began the Roche Amplicor\u00ae Access Program to provide two free baseline HIV viral load tests to anyone in the United States with HIV (James, 1996). Reference laboratories helped execute this program, which began the successful uptake of HIV viral load testing in the marketplace. As with traditional diagnostics, molecular diagnostic tests needed to demonstrate utility and performance before their adoption into practice. First, there must be an unmet clinical need, which was clearly the case with HIV. Secondly, with the development of antiviral therapies, HIV viral load testing provided information that resulted in a therapeutic action, and also provided the means to continually monitor the efficacy of the treatment. Without a therapeutic, the test would have provided information that would not have informed the treatment of HIV.",

This made it much simpler to educate physicians in the use of the viral load test for the management of HIV. Highly motivated patients fueled demand for the test. The viral load test had a significant role in early clinical trials of antiviral therapeutics and became an objective measurement tool, even before any protease inhibitors were approved for physician use. Publications on the antiviral therapeutics included the HIV viral load results. Thought leaders who participated in the trials became early adopters of the test, even before the test was FDA approved. The viral load test was put into a kit format and became FDA approved at approximately the same time as the first protease inhibitors became available. Recommendations for viral load testing became part of standard guidelines for treating HIV infection (Chesebro and Everett, 1998). The theranostic became tied to the use of the drug. Roche's Amplicor Access Program led to rapid test utilization. As volumes increased, manufacturers developed automation. HIV management requires relatively frequent monitoring, as often as four times per year. Therefore, the test was not a \u201cone off\u201d test as in constitutional genetic testing. HIV viral load testing also obtained its own CPT code, facilitating reimbursement. Additionally, the kit manufacturer, the national reference labs, patients, and doctors all worked to ensure that the test was reimbursed. These factors helped make HIV viral load testing cost effective and a foundation of HIV prevention efforts. The combination of viral load testing and new therapeutics transformed HIV from a uniformly fatal disease to a chronic treatable disease. Therefore, HIV has become a disease with an \u201cactionable\u201d result. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations now call for general population screening for HIV status. This example of translating a diagnostic into patient care was successful because so many of the hallmarks of successful diagnostic tests were in place. There was an unmet clinical need, an actionable result was obtained from testing, the test was ultimately cost effective, high-throughput analysis became available, and reimbursement issues were rapidly resolved.",

            "text": "Similar to the convergence of HIV therapeutics and the need for HIV viral load assays, the development of the anti-cancer therapeutic Herceptin required a clinical laboratory test to determine Her2 receptor status (Tsongalis and Silverman, 2006). Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene (HER2) in primary breast cancer carcinomas had been shown to correlate to poor clinical prognosis for breast cancer patients (Ferretti et al., 2007). The Her2/neu oncogene is active in 25\u201337% of breast cancers, and overexpression of the HER2 protein on cell surfaces was found to stimulate uncontrolled tumor growth. Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a recombinant DNA-derived monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits the proliferation of HER2 overexpressing tumor cells. Herceptin alone was associated with an objective response in 15% of extensively pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2, and 26% of previously untreated patients (McKeage and Perry, 2002). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 13% of patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel and in 4.7% of patients receiving only Herceptin. Given the high cost of Herceptin therapy, the significant side effects of Herceptin treatment for some patients, and the targeted nature of the therapeutic, it was necessary to restrict therapy to patients expected to respond to treatment. In 1998, the FDA approved both Herceptin and the HerCepTest for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. HER2 protein is detected primarily by IHC or FISH methods. HercepTest and PathVysion, a FISH assay for HER2 amplification, are now used to select patients for Herceptin therapy. Uptake of diagnostic testing for HER2 receptor status was greatly accelerated due to safety issues associated with the therapy. Additionally, the assay did not require new tissue samples as in many cases archived samples in paraffin blocks were already being sent to reference labs for estrogen and progesterone analysis, and physicians could merely check another box on the test order sheet. Randomized clinical trials have recently demonstrated significant differences in survival when comparing chemotherapy to chemotherapy plus Herceptin in women with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer in either the metastatic or adjuvant setting (Ferretti et al., 2007). Thus, what was once a prognosticator of poor outcome for the patient has become a predictive marker of response to therapy. Unfortunately, a lack of concordance among detection techniques, different scoring systems used to determine HER2 status, and a lack of lab standardization and quality based on test experience have led to significant variation in HER2 testing (Nelson, 2000). Recent CAP/ASCO guidelines, that include a testing algorithm, QA requirements, lab evaluations, and a scoring system, should help address these issues (CAP/ASCO, 2007).",

In the United States more than 6 million new cases are reported annually and at least 20 million people in this country are already infected (NIAID, 2006). Approximately 40 of the 100 types of HPV virus can be sexually transmitted, but most rarely cause symptoms or disease. Types 6 and 11 are low-cancer risk types that cause genital warts. Low-and high-risk types can cause the growth of abnormal cells which can be detected when a Pap test is done during a gynecologic exam. The Bethesda system divides the most common clearly abnormal Pap results into either: low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) which are mild cell changes associated with HPV; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) which are precancerous cell changes which should be treated by a physician; and cancer. Clinicians managing a not-completely-normal Pap result, known as ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), may benefit from the additional information provided by HPV testing.",

In 2003, the FDA expanded the use of HPV testing in conjunction with the Pap test for routine screening. The test uses hybrid capture technology to directly detect HPV virus DNA and the current system allows high-throughput testing. A woman fitting the appropriate clinical criteria with both a negative Pap and negative HPV DNA test has less than a one in one thousand chance of developing cervical cancer. In 2006, the FDA-approved Merck and Co's Gardisil, a recombinant vaccine which is designed to prevent the majority of HPV-related clinical diseases, those caused by HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cases of cervical cancer, while HPV 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of genital wart cases. In clinical studies, Gardasil prevented 100% of HPV 16- and 18-related cervical cancer in women not previously exposed to the relevant HPV types. These studies were conducted on 21,000 women ages 16\u201326 and the vaccine was nearly 100% effective in preventing precancerous lesions and genital warts. Gardisil was evaluated and approved in 6 months under the FDA's priority review process, a process for products with potential to provide significant health benefits (FDA, 2006f). On June 28, 2006 the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all females between the ages of 11\u201326 receive the HPV vaccine as part of routine primary care.",

However, not all diagnostic tests find their way to application in health care. For some, clinical utility may not be demonstrated due to the lack of an actionable result, cost-effectiveness, high-throughput methods, or adequate reimbursement. For example, early asymptomatic glaucoma testing was widely abandoned because early detection did not affect the outcome. Other tests may not achieve the analytical performance characteristics required of a good diagnostic. Assay sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value must be high (Gaeta, 2005). Reproducible precision and a clinically reportable range must be demonstrated (Irwig, et al., 2002). For example, before microarray technology can be translated widely to diagnostic applications, problems with sensitivity and reproducibility will have to solved (Petrik, 2006). A rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests prior to their introduction into clinical practice is the goal of the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy (STARD) initiative (Bossuyt et al., 2003) and evaluation of genomic applications in practice and prevention (EGAPP), a CDC project to establish an evidence-based process for assessing applications of genomic technology (CDC and National Office of Public Health Genomics, 2008). Ultimately, the role of diagnostics in clinical care must be balanced with other tools available to the physician, such as patient history and physical exam (Halkin et al., 1997). Additionally, technological advancements must produce an increase in efficacy of treatment in excess of that produced by improving the delivery of older treatments (Woolf and Johnson, 2005).",

Studies have found a 30\u201350% reduction in direct hospital and outpatient charges when changes in patient health status are accurately monitored. Yet, diagnostic tests recommended as standard of care are underused 51% of the time (Olsen, 2006).
