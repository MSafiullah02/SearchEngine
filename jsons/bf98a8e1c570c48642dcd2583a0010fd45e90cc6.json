Extreme measures, including continued social distancing and coordinated suppression efforts, may be required to reduce catastrophic mortality (1) . Although the pandemic threatens everyone, it is a particularly grave risk to the millions of Americans with opioid use disorder, who-already vulnerable and marginalized-are heavily dependent on face-to-face health care delivery. Rapid and coordinated action on the part of clinicians and policymakers is required if these threats are to be mitigated.",

Such challenges are especially acute for patients who receive methadone through opioid treatment programs, because historically the dispensing of methadone has been tightly regulated, requiring many patients to receive no more than 1 directly observed daily dose at a time (2) . Recognizing the imperative to address potentially dire disruptions in care, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) recently released new guidance increasing the ability of opioid treatment programs to transfer as many patients as possible to takehome methadone maintenance protocols (3) . To address concern that SAMHSA's new guidance might spur an increase in nonmedical methadone use, as well as to improve quality of care, persons receiving take-home methadone should be coprescribed naloxone, an opioid reversal agent that may mitigate the risks of fatal overdose among those at high risk (4) .",

Medicaid and Medicare waivers, made possible by national emergency declarations, can support these changes. For example, the recent declarations expand options for the remote prescription of controlled substances without an initial inperson evaluation (5) . Likewise, Medicare rules have been relaxed to increase reimbursement of telehealth services, and SAMHSA has clarified that although the regulations around sharing of protected health information between addiction and general medical providers have not been suspended, providers can use their discretion to determine whether a bona fide medical emergency exists (such as a hospital needing more clinical information about an unconscious patient). In this case, the normal requirement to obtain informed consent may be waived (6) . States also can request Medicaid reimbursement for telehealth services, including those used for opioid addiction treatment, and modes of communication that enable most patients to participate, such as telephone sessions. States also might relax licensure or other legal barriers to controlled substance prescribing via telemedicine during this national emergency (7) . Additional waiver requests could support block grants for telemedicine infrastructure, including virtual counseling capabilities, remote delivery of medications, and additional wraparound support services to persons isolated, quarantined, or at risk due to COVID-19.",

Such technologies as automated, secure pill dispensers also may be used, unlocking daily medication doses and alerting programs about missed doses or device tampering.
