            "text": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe complication of prematurity, with a multifactorial pathogenesis including, but not limited to, arrested lung development and persistent inflammation. The definition of BPD has evolved over time most recently defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), with grading of severity based on newer modes of noninvasive ventilation [1\u20134]. Because BPD has been associated with presence of low cortisol levels in premature infants and ongoing inflammation due to mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure, treatment options include corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone [5, 6]. However, despite several meta-analyses demonstrating the efficacy of steroid therapy facilitating extubation, concerns surrounding adverse effects, primarily on neurodevelopmental outcome, limited their use [7\u20139]. Given BPD has proven to be an independent risk factor for poor neurodevelopment, further studies evaluating lower cumulative doses of dexamethasone, administered later in neonatal life, or alternative steroid therapy have been conducted [10]. The DART study (Dexamethasone: A Randomized Trial) compared a lower initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, tapered over 10 days for a cumulative exposure of 0.89 mg/kg versus placebo [10]. This lower cumulative dosing regimen proved to have immediate benefits including a shortened duration of intubation for ventilator-dependent infants; however, the study was not powered to detect differences in long-term outcomes. Subsequently, a meta-analysis published in 2008 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine an optimal dosing regimen [11]. This has led to the search for alternative treatment, including steroids which target different receptors, such as hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone binds preferentially to the glucocorticoid receptor, promoting neuronal cell apoptosis. In addition to glucocorticoid receptor binding, hydrocortisone also binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is protective against neuronal cell death [12\u201314]. This dual receptor binding of hydrocortisone and therefore its protective role in neuronal apoptosis is the rationale for hydrocortisone use in our unit (Table 1) [15, 16].",

Frequency and percentage for categorical measures were calculated for the overall sample, as well as separately for those who did and did not receive DART. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to compare subjects who received DART to those who did not for continuous measures. Univariate logistic regression models were utilized to assess patient characteristics and route of administration with respect to the efficacy outcome. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to calculate differences in RSS. The average weight gain (g/day), head circumference gain (cm/week), and length gain (cm/week) were calculated separately for each birth weight category. These benchmarks were then used to determine the number of patients who had an appropriate weight gain from initiation to 2 weeks, 2\u20134 weeks, and initiation to 4 weeks. The paired t test was used to assess the difference in head circumference from initiation to 2 months and was used only if the data were distributed normally. A separate repeated measures analysis of variance with a mixed models approach was used to assess weight and length across time. The repeated (within subjects) factor was time (e.g., 2 weeks prior, 1 week prior, at initiation, 2 weeks post, and 4 weeks post). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to calculate the differences in the RSS. A result was considered statistically significant at a p value of <0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",

Patient characteristics are reported in Fig. 1b. The median GA of our patient cohort was 25.6 weeks with a median birth weight of 0.76 kg and males accounting for 64.6% of the patients (n = 31). Approximately 73% of the patients (n = 35) received IV hydrocortisone and 27% (n = 13) received the same dose orally. Half of our patients (n = 24) were tapered off hydrocortisone and the most commonly utilized taper regimen was a 20% daily decrease (4-day wean, for a total 9-day course). The other half of the cohort received 5 days of hydrocortisone without tapering (Fig. 1b). The majority of patients were administered hydrocortisone between day of life 20\u201340 and PMA 29\u201332 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 1a and b) at a median of 33 days with the earliest initiation of hydrocortisone at 9 days.",

Patient length increased by a median of 1.05 cm per week in the first 2 weeks following initiation of therapy and by 1.5 cm per week in weeks 2\u20134 following initiation (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Based on data published by Anchieta et al., this is a normal weight and length growth rate for a premature baby [29]. Lastly, we reviewed head circumference growth and head ultrasound results after hydrocortisone treatment as an indication for potential future neurodevelopmental impairment. For all patients, head circumference increased, as expected [29], by a median of 1 cm weekly up to 2 months post treatment (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Head ultrasound results worsened during and soon after hydrocortisone therapy in two patients. One patient presented with findings consistent with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) during treatment, suggestive of complicated birth and perinatal history as a possible cause. The second patient developed grade 1 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) during hydrocortisone treatment with progression to PVL one month later. In this case, we cannot exclude any association between hydrocortisone and the head ultrasound findings. Both of these patients did not receive DART therapy during their NICU admission.",

Dexamethasone was dosed according to the DART protocol [10] and was administered to 50% (10/20) of our patients after hydrocortisone was unsuccessful in leading to extubation. Of those who were administered dexamethasone, 20% (2/10) were extubated during the DART course (Fig. 4a), however, both patients were reintubated by 10 days posttreatment completion. There was not a significant decrease in the median RSS from day 0 at 13.2 to 6.4 at day 10 in the DART group, p < 0.2754 (Fig. 4b) Patients who later received DART therapy (hydrocortisone non-responders, HC-NR) were younger at the time of hydrocortisone initiation compared with the cohort who did not receive DART therapy, with a median day of life of 25 and PMA of 29.7 weeks. (Fig. 4c). Most patients were ~40\u201360 days of life at time of DART initiation and the majority of patients were initiated on DART within 2 weeks of hydrocortisone treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3).

The limitations include the lack of a control group due to the retrospective nature of the study, being a single center study and the small sample size. The number of patients included in the study was based on feasibility and availability of resources, therefore a formal sample size calculation was not possible to perform. The patients\u2019 included in the study were born with a median GA of 25 weeks and a birth weight less than 1 kg providing clinically useful information on the subgroup of patients at higher risk for BPD. A prospective double-blinded study would need to be performed to clarify which corticosteroids should be used as a safer first- or second-line treatment in preterm ventilated infants. Finally, head circumference changes were followed for only 2 months following treatment and even though it has been proven to be a tool to identify neonates at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, it does not directly correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome [39]. Bearing in mind the above considerations, the results of our study still provide useful information on the use of hydrocortisone in premature infants with developing BPD as a first-line steroid treatment to decrease ventilator support.",
