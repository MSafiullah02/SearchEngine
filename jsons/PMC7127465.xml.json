            "text": "Emerging, extremely contagious, infectious diseases caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), dengue fever and influenza have concerned public health organizations in recent years. Among them, influenza infection, which is induced by the influenza virus presented in the aerosols generated by sneezing and coughing, has been reported as a contagious disease of mainly the upper respiratory tract. It may cause acute respiratory tract infection in humans and severe morbidity, especially in the elderly and children (Stockton et al., 1998). Human influenza virus is either type A or B; the influenza A virus is further classified into several subtypes such as A/H1N1, A/H1N3 based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins present in the viral envelope (Uyeki, 2003). Particularly, influenza A viruses are among the most virulent pathogens that could cause devastating outbreaks and give rise to human influenza pandemics (Hay et al., 2001). For example, a novel influenza strain combined with the genes from humans and pigs, which was dubbed the \u201cswine flu\u201d and is also known as influenza A/H1N1, has emerged in Mexico, the United States and several other nations, causing fears of a severe worldwide pandemic (Chowell et al., 2009). In addition to effective vaccines, tools that enable fast, accurate, and sensitive diagnosis of influenza viruses are greatly needed during the early stage of infections, such that the epidemic spread of influenza infections can be quarantined and controlled.",

            "text": "As a consequence, the ability to rapidly diagnosis for the presence of the influenza virus during the acute phase of the infection is essential in order to provide immediate and appropriate clinical treatment and to enact quarantine procedures. Recently, a number of diagnostic methods for the detection of the influenza virus, such as a culture, an immunofluorescence (IF) assay (Shibata et al., 2009), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Sala et al., 2003), a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (Boivin et al., 2004), a serological hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (Swayne et al., 2007) and a complement fixation test (CFT) (de Ory et al., 2004) have been developed. Among them, the molecular diagnostic assays such as PCR and polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (RT-PCR) for the detection of influenza infection provides a highly sensitive and selective diagnosis protocol. However, these protocols are usually complicated and relatively costly. They also require a lengthy process and expensive apparatus to perform the entire process. Also, ELISA is an alternative, well-recognized, serological diagnostic method for the detection of influenza infection (Chomel et al., 1989, Zhang et al., 2006). The principle behind the immunological diagnosis is based on the detection of color change in or fluorescence of secondary antibodies, which are specific to the target pathogens. However, a conventional ELISA is usually performed on two-dimensional (2D) 96-well plates, which involves a series of tedious processes such as incubation and washing steps. This makes it a time-consuming (over 4 h) and labor-intensive process that requires well-trained personnel to precisely perform the protocol. The sensitivity of the conventional ELISA is not satisfactory since the antibody is coated onto the 2D plate, which is the limiting factor for the binding capacity to the target antigens. A more sensitive immunological detection technique is urgently needed.",

The binding capacity of a specific antibody can be increased using a 3D solid-phase immunoassay and, therefore, increase the detection sensitivity. For example, a microsphere-based, flow-cytometric immunoassay for the detection of influenza viruses was found to have a 10-fold lower detection limit than traditional ELISA (Yan et al., 2005). Another fluorophore-DNA-barcode-based immunoassay with the target avian influenza virus sandwiched between magnetic immunoprobes and barcode-carrying immunoprobes has also been demonstrated recently (Cao et al., 2010). Its detection sensitivity was comparable to that of conventional RT-PCR. More importantly, it is less time-consuming (<2 h for the entire detection protocol). Nevertheless, it still presents a challenge for the rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of influenza infection using these state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques since several tedious purification processes and manual operation are always required, especially to prevent the spread of infection in resource-limited regions without the support of reference laboratories (Koh et al., 2008). Therefore, there is a great need to develop an easy-to-use, sample-to-answer platform for rapid and automatic detection of influenza infection with a high sensitivity and selectivity.",

Consequently, various bead-based immunoassays implemented on microfluidic systems have been reported recently (Vignali, 2000, Fern\u00e1ndez-Lafuente and Guis\u00e1n, 2006, Yang et al., 2008). Generally speaking, bead-based immunoassays have several advantages over substrate-based assays. In addition to their sample purification and concentration capabilities enabled by applying external magnetic fields, micro-beads have a 3D structure which increases the surface-to-volume ratio, thus providing more binding sites for target molecules or pathogens. Furthermore, surface modification of a microfluidic device has been reported to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of an immunoassay (Vignali, 2000, Bai et al., 2006). Still, several lengthy off-chip sample pre-treatment processes are necessary to purify the samples prior to use and bulky equipment is normally required, thus hindering the practical applications of the proposed assays for clinical diagnosis. In this study, a microfluidic diagnostic assay incorporated with a 3D magnetic-bead-based FIA and an optical detection module for influenza A virus purification, concentration, collection and detection is proposed. The entire diagnostic process can be completed within approximately 15 min with little human intervention.",

The clinical serum sample, the washing buffer, the developing anti-virus mAb-biotin reagent and the PE-streptavidin (S) conjugates are loaded into the sample loading chamber, the washing buffer chamber, the developing mAb chamber and the PE chamber, respectively, followed by loading the mAb-conjugated magnetic beads into the sample loading chamber (Fig. 1(a)). An initial incubation process is employed to mix the clinical serum with the mAbs-bound magnetic beads so that target influenza viral particles can be recognized and become attached onto the mAbs-bound magnetic beads to form the virus-bound magnetic complexes (Fig. 1(b)). This is followed by purifying and isolating the virus-conjugated magnetic complexes using a magnetic field generated by an external permanent magnet located underneath the mixing chamber and a microfluidic control module driven by a vacuum source. After that, a washing process is performed using both the permanent magnet and the microfluidic control module to wash away all the un-bound materials in the clinical samples, so that the virus-bound magnetic complexes are successfully isolated from the specimen sample (Fig. 1(c)). Then, the purified virus-bound magnetic complexes are re-suspended into a volume of 20 \u03bcL and the developing mAb fluorescent conjugates are then injected into the mixing chamber. This is followed by a second incubation process which binds the developing mouse anti-influenza NP mAb-biotin with the virus-conjugated magnetic complexes (Fig. 1(d)), and then followed by repeatedly washing 3 times to rinse any un-bound developing mAb away. Next, the PE-S conjugates are pumped into the mixing chamber to perform a third incubation process for the labeling of a fluorescent dye onto the magnetic complexes (Fig. 1(e)). Then, a final washing step is performed to flush away other interferent materials and any un-bound PE-S molecules (Fig. 1(f)). Finally, the sandwich-like magnetic bead complexes are then re-suspended into a smaller volume (10 \u03bcL) within the \u201coptical detection chamber\u201d where the fluorescent signal can be excited and analyzed by an external optical detection module (Fig. 1(g)). Detailed information about the on-chip experimental procedures of the immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic assay including the reaction volume of the samples, the reaction time and the operating conditions for the microfluidic systems can be found in Table 1\n.",

The light source from the mercury lamp is first directed through an excitation band-pass (BP) filter (535/25BP, Nikon, Japan) and is used to excite the fluorescent PE dye labeled on the magnetic complexes.

Only signals with wavelengths greater than 590 nm can pass through and be detected by the PMT. With this approach, high-sensitivity detection of the influenza viruses can be achieved.

Well-mixed incubation can be generated using the suction-type micro-mixer by deforming and releasing the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes of the micro-mixer at P\n = \u221280 kPa and f\nd\n = 4.0 Hz. The isolated influenza virus A/H3 (97N50H3) with a concentration of 1:128 with 4\u22124 dilution (8 HAU) is used for the optimization of the three incubation processes. The experimental verification of these optimum conditions during the diagnostic process (as shown in Supplemental Fig. 8 in SI) is also compared with the results from conventional bench-top systems (a large-scale shaker (INTELLI-MIXER, ELMI Ltd., Latvia) and a permanent magnetic concentrator (DynaMag\u2122-2, Invitrogen, USA)) using a manual preparation protocol (as shown in Supplemental Fig. 9 in the SI). The mixing between the mAb-conjugated magnetic beads and the specimen samples is one of the most critical processes for the diagnosis of the influenza infections. It can be clearly seen from the results that it only takes 5 min to reach a saturated fluorescent intensity (631.1 \u00b1 65.1 mV, n\n = 3) by utilizing this microfluidic assay under optimum operating conditions (P\n = \u221280 kPa, f\nd\n = 4.0 Hz) during the first incubation process. In comparison, the conventional bench-top systems may need more than 60 min to reach a fluorescent intensity of 695.6 \u00b1 75.7 mV (n\n = 3). Furthermore, the other two major incubation steps are also verified using the suction-type micro-mixer and it only takes 5 min for the second and third incubation step to achieve maximum fluorescent intensities of 603.5 \u00b1 78.9 mV and 662.3 \u00b1 62.1 mV (n\n = 3), respectively, while the traditional method using a large-scale shaker requires more than 60 min for each incubation process. As a result, this proposed microfluidic diagnostic assay for the rapid detection of influenza virus can perform each incubation process in 5 min within the suction-type microfluidic system.

From these experimental results, it is found that the detectable fluorescent intensity is measured to be 219.7 \u00b1 37.7 mV (n\n = 3) in a sample with a viral concentration of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n HAU (as shown in Fig. 5(a)). Note that the fluorescent intensity of the negative control is around 149.7 \u00b1 17.24 mV. Fig. 5(b) shows a series of optical images of the magnetic complexes purified from the specimen samples with different viral concentrations utilizing the optical detection module in the microfluidic assay. More importantly, a comparison of the sensitivity between the microfluidic assay and the manual protocol is shown in Fig. 5(c-1) and (c-2), respectively, where D represents the logarithm of the dilution folds to base 4 for the influenza viral sample with an initial concentration of 128 HAU. It is found that 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 HAU of influenza viruses can be detected by the proposed immunomagnetic bead-based FIA in the microfluidic system within 15 min, while only 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22121 to 5 \u00d7 10\u22121\n HAU of influenza virus can be detected by the manual protocol with an immunomagnetic bead-based FIA in approximately 3 h. In other words, the specimen samples with an influenza virus concentration higher than 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n HAU would be classified as a \u201cpositive\u201d result in the proposed microfluidic assay. Accordingly, compared to a conventional flow cytometry technique (FACSCalibur\u2122, BD Biosciences, USA) which is integrated with an immunomagnetic bead-based FIA for influenza virus detection, the sensitivity is found to be 0.5 HAU (Supplemental Fig. 10 in the SI). The LOD of the proposed microfluidic assay is still 10-fold higher than the fluorescent DNA barcode-based immunoassay (Cao et al., 2010), which can detect the influenza virus with a HA titer of \u223c1.28 \u00d7 10\u22123 HA in approximately 2 h. This high sensitivity makes it possible to detect the influenza virus at the early phase of infection even before the clinical symptom. Hence, the diagnostic time required for the entire FIA in the microfluidic assay can be significantly reduced due to the fact that an efficient mixing effect can be generated to conjugate the samples with the 3D structure of the mAb-coated magnetic particles, thus enhancing the interaction between the antibody and the antigen. However, it can be clearly seen from the results that the output voltage of the PMT module does not increase by the factor of 4 on each sample with an increasing viral concentration. It may be explained by two reasons. First, the optical signal is emitted from the optical detection chamber where 8 \u00d7 104 magnetic complexes are gathered and focused in a relatively small region by a permanent magnet, such that the optical signal of the magnetic complexes might be affected by the uneven distribution of the stacked beads. Accordingly, reducing the used amount of the magnetic beads might be an alternative approach to solve this problem such that the optical response of the PMT module would be varied more linearly. Nonetheless, the detection limit of the proposed assay might be significantly impaired and the mixing time for incubation process would be increased due to the less used amount of the magnetic beads. Another reason is that the fluorescent signal generated by a fluorochrome-labeled protein is in proportion to the moles of fluorochrome per mole of protein (F/P ratio) over a limited range. Over-coupling (i.e., coupling more fluorescein per mole of protein than the optimal F/P ratio) may not yield a proportional increase in fluorescence since there may be greatly quenched. Furthermore, excessive modification of the protein may change the native antibody structure and thereby decrease the affinity of the antibody for an antigen.",
