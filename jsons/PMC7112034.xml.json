Billington et al. (2011) suggest that uncontrolled stock access to waterways results in elevated public health risks from pathogens based on hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response analysis, and risk characterisation of stock accessing waterways upstream of drinking water off-takes. Aarons and Gourley (2012) suggest improved riparian zone protection approaches and strategies are needed, and Miller et al. (2010) indicate that not all water quality endpoints are improved with riparian zone fencing.",

Varied fecal inputs have the potential to confound the true nature of BMP impact on, in particular, loading of microorganisms in water and the prevalence and nature of zoonotic pathogens of differing virulence potential to humans.",

Most often, agricultural BMPs that are protective of water quality are evaluated for environmental and production benefits, but their potential human health risk implications are not. Schmidt et al. (2013a) recently demonstrated that quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) could be used to quantify human potential health risks from Campylobacter spp. associated with tile drainage management BMPs imposed en masse at a watershed scale. However, even QMRA approaches must consider true relative and absolute risks in the context of differences in pathogen species, genotype, serovars, strains or lineage occurrence, because not all of these pathogen subtypes necessarily have the same virulence potential to humans (see Afchain et al.'s (2008) accounting of differing strains of Bacillus cereus in QMRA of manufactured food, for example). Parsing out risks on the basis of human pathogenicity better represents true exposure risks in the framework of BMP assessment.",

It also assessed the utility of fecal indicator organisms to predict pathogen prevalence. The underpinning study hypothesis is that cattle associated pathogens will decrease or remain constant within the restricted cattle access pasture (RCA), and then increase within a downstream unrestricted cattle access pasture (URCA). A Bayesian QMRA approach was employed to calculate human health risks from a hypothetical recreational exposure to these waters for selected pathogens.",

The stream is intermittent (Strahler order = 2) with low and no-flows typically occurring in summer. The stream drains a watershed of roughly 482 ha above the experimental site (above the RCA and URCA area) (Schmidt et al., 2013a). The study framework is an upstream downstream design (USDA, 1996). The RCA area is \u223c2 ha in size with a fence buffering the stream from pasturing adult cattle (3\u20135 m buffer). Stream flow length in the RCA is \u223c356 m with a flow gradient of \u223c0.002 m m\u22121. The RCA is situated upstream of the \u223c2 ha URCA where adult cattle have unrestricted access to the stream. The URCA possesses a \u223c348 m stream flow length and gradient of \u223c0.004 m m\u22121. Holstein cattle densities were maintained at \u223c2.5 animals ha\u22121 in both systems; a density that is not uncommon for pasturing operations in the study region. Cattle were generally allowed to graze from May-June to November-December, beginning in 2005. Adjacent to the RCA and URCA experimental pastures are several residential homes on the southern bank of the stream; small septic system leakages have been observed on occasion. Other prospective fecal inputs along the experimental pastures include house pets, and observed wildlife including small birds, muskrat, vole, turtle, duck, Canada goose, and wild turkey. Fecal inputs upstream of the RCAin could be impacted potentially by a small hobby farm located immediately upstream of RCAin. The farm consists of penned animals of very low and variable seasonal intensity (10\u201320 goats, 1 donkey, and 2 horses). Yet, it is unclear if there was significant impact of the farm on stream water quality given that many of these livestock were penned in areas where lot drainage to the stream would have been minimal. Liquid swine manures were also applied on fields west of the study area that could have contaminated the roadside ditch that drained near the RCAin sample site in spring and/or fall, but these applications were not frequent.",

A second-order risk characterization procedure comparable to that of Schmidt et al. (2013a) was used to separate variability from uncertainty in, 1) the parameters of the gamma distribution describing temporal concentration variability, 2) the fraction of enumerated microorganisms that were infectious, and 3) the parameter(s) of the dose-response model. In this approach, mean risk for a particular set of parameter values was evaluated using numerical integration, and 30,000 such sets of parameters (collectively representing uncertainty in the estimated parameters) were used to evaluate the uncertainty in mean risk. The resulting risk information was summarized using 95% credible intervals for mean risk (illustrating the anticipated probability of infection for the hypothetical exposure and effect of all sources of uncertainty). The posterior probability that the mean risk at one site was greater than that at another was used as the Bayesian analog to significance in a two-tailed hypothesis test. This does not provide a measure of statistical significance (p-value): however, strong support for a substantial difference exists when computed posterior probabilities exceed 0.975, which is the analog of a two-tailed p-value of 0.05 (Schmidt et al., 2013a).",

Overall, there were not many strong statistically significant trends in pathogen prevalence or densities associated with restricting cattle access to the water course (protecting riparian zone). However, indicator bacteria densities (total coliform, fecal coliform, E. coli) were higher at the RCAin site compared to RCAout/URCAin site (p < 0.05, MWU), illustrating an apparent riparian zone treatment effect. Restricting cattle access did not reduce, statistically speaking, Campylobacter spp. occurrence relative to upstream (site input) prevalence, and surprisingly, Campylobacter spp. occurrence was even lower at the URCAout relative to RCAin. Schmidt et al. (2013a) found that Campylobacter spp. densities were relatively high in these watersheds at RCAin, and upstream of the RCAin, where the only potential for agricultural inputs of Campylobacter spp. would have been related to land applications of manure and subsequent stream inputs via, primarily, subsurface tile drainage. The overall decreasing trend in Campylobacter spp. detection downstream from RCAin to URCAout was most pronounced during fall at higher flows; a time when manure is applied to fields and manure contaminants can be transported off site via tile drainage possibly resulting in overall higher prevalence at RCAin. Sunohara et al. (2012) described the RCA as functioning as an in-line wetland, where loads of many fecal pollution indicators and nutrients were found to decrease significantly from RCAin to RCAout/URCAin and increase again from RCAout/URCAin to URCAout. If the source of Campylobacter spp. was primarily from livestock, the RCA effect may have been formative in terms of reducing the prevalence of this pathogen in water. The light pasturing in the URCA and lack of cattle related manure land applications on fields adjacent to the RCA and URCA may have helped promote the steady downstream decreases in prevalence observed. Moreover, in fall, the pasturing cattle are often trucked back to barns for the winter, which would further reduce potential livestock-based fecal inputs in both pasture treatments. However, Campylobacter spp. has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of avian-sourced Cryptosporidium in the area (Wilkes et al., 2013), which may partially explain site prevalence differences.",

Infected livestock likely introduced the E. coli serotype (Renter et al., 2003) into the watercourse via fecal contamination in close proximity to the sampling site, given that cattle have direct access to the water course at this site and that there was no detection of this pathogen at URCAout just downstream. When predicting downstream public health risks from exposure to E. coli O157:H7, it was demonstrated that cattle access, most likely, has a direct influence on increasing risk, and although not significant, it is important to differentiate E. coli detected in a surface water system (many of which are not human pathogens) from those that are capable of initiating human infections (like E. coli O157:H7). Unlike Cryptosporidium and Giardia, the breadth of the credible intervals in predicted mean risk shrank by roughly two orders of magnitude when relative mean risks were used instead of mean risks. This suggests that roughly two orders of magnitude of uncertainty are attributable to uncertainty in the parameters of the dose\u2013response model. This illustrates the importance of using relative mean risks to understand a system, given that dose\u2013response data will continue to remain the limiting factor in our ability to more precisely quantify risk.",

Cole et al.

(2002) has observed differential survival rates of subtypes of F-RNA in water. For this study, greatest median densities of F-RNA coliphage occurred in fall while greatest median densities of F-DNA coliphage occurred in spring. Nevertheless, the issue of variable environmental fitness of a microorganism, or strain, can make it additionally difficult to observe the effects of landscape factors on densities (Anderson et al., 2005, van Elsas et al., 2011).",

This is consistent with findings of Wilkes et al., 2009, Wilkes et al., 2013. Seasonal attributes could be important in the timing and intensity of fecal inputs from various sources, the seasonal growth of filtering vegetation in the riparian zone, and the accumulation of fecal material over time in and along the stream system. Further, season is interrelated with the timing of critical hydrological events for moving contaminants in water, and season is connected to temperature and moisture factors that affect the survivability of pathogens in soil/water environments.",

Cryptosporidium QMRA results underscore the importance of incorporating the proportion of human pathogenic oocysts (including C. hominis (human host source)) in the final risk estimates, resulting in a reduction in mean risk by at least one order of magnitude. These results, in the context of the detection of norovirus GII and rotavirus (which can be of human origin) at these sites, suggest there could be an influence of human waste in this system (e.g., septic leakage). Regarding Giardia, the lack of additional subtyping data to differentiate between human pathogenic Giardia among all Giardia detected, limits how we interpret the influence of the URCA on the Giardia levels detected at all three sample sites. Based solely on Giardia cyst concentrations, the QMRA analyses illustrate an increasing risk from RCAin to URCAout, although not statistically significant. These QMRA results underscore the importance of understanding the many potential sources of fecal inputs in an open system such as a watershed when interpreting the impact of a land use management practice on public health endpoints.",

(2013) estimated that Norovirus was the number one ranked foodborne illness in Canada. While extensions in this context cannot be made directly to waterborne exposure, a high norovirus prevalence was observed in this study in relation to other viral targets (greater than \u223c40% of samples for URCAout in summer). Perhaps small order streams helped reduce dilution effects. Norovirus genogroup II is one of the currently 5 identified genogroups (GI-GV) of norovirus, for which GII genotypes are the most commonly known for infecting humans (Lindesmith et al., 2008), but some are also found in swine. Norovirus GII and group A rotavirus (found in human, swine, and bovine) tended to be higher at RCAin, decrease in prevalence at RCAout/URCAin, and increase again at the URCAout. These prevalence trends did underscore the significant and documented RCA effect found in the fecal indicator bacteria (Fig. 4) and nutrient and fecal indicator loads given in Sunohara et al. (2012). Liquid swine manure has been applied on fields that can, under high rainfall situations, drain into roadside ditches that could impact the RCAin, as a result, swine inputs cannot be refuted. The contributions from septic systems from homes located along the stream (Sunohara et al., 2012), as well as pets and a few hobby farm animals associated with them, is not clearly explicit from the data reported in this study (outside of the C. hominis observations regarding human source). But these sources could have contributed, along with inhibited dilution effects in this intermittent system, to the higher relative rates of occurrence of this virus in the water course.",

Assessment of BMP impact on surface water quality within a public health context would currently require monitoring of a suite of pathogens and their densities for different treatments at great monetary and logistical expense. Ideally, fecal indicator organisms could serve as pathogen proxies or surrogates in this capacity (Wilkes et al., 2009). For the pathogenic viruses, there were no strong relationships with F-RNA or F-DNA coliphage density or occurrence which would appear to reduce potential for coliphage data in this small surface water system to serve as proxies for viral pathogens. There were, however, multiple indicator microorganisms that could serve as modest pathogen proxies, especially for Campylobacter spp. and to a lesser extent Cryptosporidium spp., thereby complimenting the results observed in Wilkes et al. (2009). For assessing the effects of pasturing BMPs such as those here, the fact that fecal indicator bacteria demonstrated a \u2018low flow\u2019 pasture treatment effect indicates they could potentially serve as adequate, and considerably less expensive organisms to gauge effects of riparian zone protection on net fecal pollution (and potentially serve as a proxy for the occurrence of Campylobacter spp.).",

            "text": "Some of the key conclusions that can be drawn from this study include:\u2022\nE. coli O157:H7 was infrequently detected, but apparently, light pasturing operations with livestock having the capacity to interact with the water course can increase the likelihood of this pathogen occurring in water, and thereby increase relative mean risks of exposure to this pathogen.\u2022For the unrestricted and restricted pasture systems, relative exposure risks were ranked in decreasing order as: total Cryptosporidium, total Giardia spp., human pathogenic Cryptosporidium and E. coli O157:H7. Adjusting for the proportion of Cryptosporidium spp. detected that are infectious for humans reduces downstream risk estimates by roughly one order of magnitude. The QMRA indicated that relative risk increased across the RCA and URCA region for E. coli O157:H7; human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium relative risk slightly increased across the RCA due to the occurrence of C. hominis (associated with human and likely of septic origin from homes next to the BMP) at RCAout/URCAin and further increased in the URCA (due to increased occurrence of C. hominis and C. parvum (normally associated with cattle) in tandem at URCAout), and little change in relative risk was observed across the RCA for Giardia, but Giardia relative risk subsequently increased in the URCA. From a relative risk perspective, the fencing BMP did provide improved risk protection for Giardia whereas risks for E. coli and human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium (likely partly due to septic inputs from homes) increased downstream to URCA; the URCA region overall provides an increased risk from background, whereas the RCA region (and the BMP) results varied depending on the targeted pathogen. Using QMRA in this manner provides a more refined estimate of BMP effects on human health.\u2022The cattle exclusion measures did not have an equal effect on all microorganisms. Campylobacter spp. had high relative prevalence in this agricultural watershed but detections decreased significantly through the restricted pasture and unrestricted pasture exhibiting a pasturing/riparian protection treatment effect (Sunohara et al., 2012). In contrast, Cryptosporidium had high relative prevalence for all sites (both restricted and unrestricted, no reduction) plus subtyping attributes helped to more accurately enumerate human infectivity risks and host specificity (see Ruecker et al., 2012).\u2022Density distribution differences of total coliform, fecal coliform, E. coli, Enterococcus, and C. perfringens concentrations were associated with Campylobacter spp. detection; greater median densities of indicator organisms were observed in Campylobacter spp. presence. These indicator bacteria show promise as a conservative proxy for this pathogen in agriculturally dominated surface waters.\u2022Overall, data mining found seasonal and stream flow variables and interactions to be important for delineating pathogen occurrence and higher indicator densities relative to site pasturing treatments. Consistent with other studies, empirical models that may attempt to predict prevalence of pathogen or fecal indicators should at least assess seasonal and flow variable interactions.\u2022Indicator microorganisms exhibited no statistically significant distribution differences amongst the pasture sites except for total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli differences between RCAin and RCAout/URCAin at low flow; where relevant densities for this flow regime reduced from RCAin to RCAout/URCAin demonstrating a riparian zone treatment effect. Seasonal and flow conditions were associated more strongly with greater indicator bacteria densities, especially in the summer. Norovirus GII was detected at rates of 7\u201322%, and rotavirus 0\u20137% for monitoring sites, and no statistically significant associations were found with indicator bacteria or F-coliphage densities. It is speculated that at least house septic issues are potential sources of viruses (as supported by occurrence of C. hominis), but other sources (swine) may have contributed as well.\n",
