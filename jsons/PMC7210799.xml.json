Since the initial outbreak in China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, and COVID-19 has now been labeled a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization [2]. The full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from subclinical infection over mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death [3]. Severe disease onset might result in death due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure [4\u20136]. Currently, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through Europe and North America [7]. As of April 17, 2020, there were 2,074,529 confirmed patients, 139,378 confirmed deaths, and 213 countries, areas, or territories with COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization [8].",

It is currently not possible to assess the methodological quality of all these projects because most of these are only summaries of methodologies and not detailed published protocols. Furthermore, multiple new projects are launched every day. We identified three important reviews that are comparable to our present project. The first is a literature review published in JAMA using PubMed to identify relevant English-language articles published through March 25, 2020, on pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. The search resulted in 1315 total articles. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials, the authors also included case reports, case series, and review articles.

These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, n = 33), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, n = 16), COVID-19 (n = 3), and unspecified coronavirus (n = 2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n = 41), followed by oseltamivir (n = 10), and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 7). The authors conclude that current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials.

This methodology may be particularly important in the COVID-19 pandemic, where research evidence is emerging rapidly, current evidence is uncertain, and new research may change policy or practice decisions [18]. There are four fundamental differences between conventional systematic reviews and living systematic reviews: publication format, work processes, author team management, and statistical methods [19]. In this living systematic review, two independent investigators will receive an updated literature search file and include relevant newly published or unpublished trials once a week. The relevant meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, and network meta-analysis will continuously be updated, and if new evidence is available (judged by the steering committee), the results will be published. Every month, the steering committee will discuss whether searching once a week is necessary. The living systematic review process will be initiated April 27, 2020. For an illustration of the living systematic review work flow, see Fig. 1.\n",

We will assess our intervention effects with both a random-effects meta-analysis [34] and fixed-effect meta-analysis for each treatment comparison separately [35]. We will primarily use the more conservative point estimate of the two [13]. The more conservative point estimate is the estimate with the highest P value. We will assess a total of two primary outcomes, and we will therefore consider a P value of 0.03 or less as the threshold for statistical significance [13]. We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. We will use the eight-step procedure to assess if the thresholds for significance are crossed [13]. Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double-counting [14]. Trials with a factorial design will be included.

If network meta-analysis is performed, we will, before conducting the network meta-analysis, assess two major assumptions; transitivity and consistency. We will then perform the statistical analysis in five steps. First step is to draw a network geometry in order to overview the network relationship. Second step is to assess for the transitivity assumption across treatment comparisons in the network using boxplots, as well as evaluate the assumption of consistency using the design-by-treatment interaction model as a global test [44, 45]. Third step is to make the network forest plot or interval plot in order to illustrate the summary effect size of the comparative effectiveness among interventions. Fourth step is to calculate cumulative rankings for identifying a superiority among interventions. Last step is to evaluate publication bias or effect modifiers for a valid inference from results. Potential effect modifiers will be the same as the subgroup analyses, i.e., for-profit bias, type of comparator, age, and sex. We will also explore these through network subgroup meta-analyses (see section below). The synthesized evidence through five steps would be useful to evidence-based decision-making in healthcare.

In short, for all regression analyses, we will test for major interactions between each covariate and the intervention variable.

For each combination, we will test if the interaction term is significant and assess the effect size. We will only consider that there is evidence of an interaction if the interaction is statistically significant after Bonferroni adjusted thresholds (0.05 divided by number of possible interactions) and if the interaction shows a clinically significant effect. If it is concluded that the interaction is significant, we will consider both presenting an analysis separately for each (e.g., for each site if there is significant interaction between the trial intervention and \u201csite\u201d) and an overall analysis including the interaction term in the model [49, 50].

Another strength of this protocol is that we plan to do a living systematic review, which allows us to continuously surveil the literature and update the evidence-base of existing interventions for treatment of COVID-19 resulting in a decreased timespan from evidence to clinical practice. This is particularly important in this international health care crisis. Furthermore, we plan to contact all trial authors to receive individual patient data. Often aggregate data meta-analyses and individual patient data meta-analyses tend to show similar overall results. However, an advantage of us including individual patient data meta-analyses is that it may allow us to study intervention effects in subgroups of participants.",
