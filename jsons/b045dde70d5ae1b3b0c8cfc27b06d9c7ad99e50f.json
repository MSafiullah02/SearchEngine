            "text": "Virus evolution has resulted in an extraordinary diversity of replication strategies and life cycles. 1 Whereas the genetic information for eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is contained in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), viral genomes are less constrained and exhibit greater diversity. The different virus families have genomes formed by dsDNA or singlestranded DNA (ssDNA), dsRNA or ssRNA, with (1) positive, negative, or ambisense polarity, (2) circular or linear topology, and (3) single or multipartite genomes. ssRNA and dsRNA viruses must provide an appropriate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate their genomes, and RNA duplex replication intermediates are usually synthesized during viral infection. dsRNA is nonetheless a potent signal for the induction of intracellular defense mechanisms in higher eukaryotes, 2,3 and viruses have adopted different dsRNA sequestration mechanisms. dsRNA viruses never release their genome from a specialized capsid with an unusual T = 2 symmetry, where both the positive and negative strands are synthesized but freshly synthesized transcripts are extruded into the cell cytoplasm to be translated. 4 Positive-strand RNA viruses limit the negative-strand synthesis to very low levels, and replicative intermediates containing dsRNA regions are scarcely accumulated. Furthermore, many plant and insect positive-sense RNA viruses express a dsRNA-binding protein that acts as a potent suppressor, inhibiting host RNA silencing. 5, 6 In contrast, negative-strand viruses, which need massive amounts of both positivestranded RNA and negative-stranded RNA to be used as messages and progeny genomes, usually prevent formation of an RNA duplex by shielding the genomic (\u2212) ssRNA with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. 7, 8 Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an avian pathogen, belongs to the Birnaviridae family of nonenveloped icosahedral viruses, 9 which have a bipartite dsRNA genome (segments A and B of 3.2 and 2.8 kbp, respectively) enclosed within a singlelayered capsid with T = 13l geometry. [10] [11] [12] Results from our laboratory indicate that IBDV is an icosahedral dsRNA virus that can package more than one complete genome copy (Luque, D., Rivas, G., Alfonso, C., Carrascosa, J. L., Rodr\u00edguez, J. F. & Cast\u00f3n, J. R. (2009). Infectious Bursal Disease Virus: an icosahedral polyploidy dsRNA virus. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. In press). Our analyses focused on E5 IBDV virions, the most abundant population in an infected cell, which package four dsRNA segments.",

VP3 (256 residues) is a multitasking protein that has several activities throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to being a self-interacting protein, 17 VP3, mediated by its last five mainly acidic residues, interacts with pVP2 during particle morphogenesis. 18, 19 In addition, mediated by the 16 C-terminal-most residues, VP3 interacts with VP1 [20] [21] [22] independently of the presence of dsRNA. VP3 is also an RNA-binding protein, 23,24 and its atomic structure was recently solved by X-ray crystallography to 2.3 \u00c5. 25 The VP3 central region (residues 92-220) is organized as a dimer in the Fig. 1 .

The scheme represents the IBDV model with its associated stoichiometry for the major structural components. This scheme is adapted from the work of Ahlquist. 28 A polyploid virion with four packaged dsRNA segments is shown as E5 IBDV particles. Dialysis of IBDV virions against low-salt buffer in the presence of EDTA renders structurally preserved RNP (constituted by dsRNA, VP3, and VP1/VPg) and soluble capsid protein subunits of VP2/pVP2 (left arrow); treatment of these RNP crude preparations with SDS releases VP3 and noncovalently bound VP1 subunits as soluble components and VPg-dsRNA complexes. Treatment of these crude VPg-dsRNA preparations with proteinase K would eventually render dsRNA molecules. Incubation of E5 IBDV virions with SDS and proteinase K releases dsRNA segments (right arrow). crystal and is folded into two \u03b1-helical domains connected by a long hinge.

Birnavirus capsid and RdRp proteins are unexpectedly similar to their corresponding counterparts in some positive-sense ssRNA viruses, such as nodaviruses and tetraviruses. 11, 27 Here, we used several approaches for structural and functional characterization of VP3 interactions with dsRNA and VP1 in IBDV. We developed a purification method rendering stable RNP, whose reproducibility is easily monitored by retarding electrophoretic analysis. The dsRNA-binding properties of VP3 make the genomic dsRNA less accessible to RNase III without introducing genome compaction. In addition, the purified RNP of IBDV is functional in transcription and/or replication, and its integrity is required for RdRp activity.",

In a similar procedure, dialysis of purified IBDV E5 full virions against a low-salt buffer in the presence of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) ruptured most particles to release RNPs. These RNPs consisted of dsRNA molecules complexed with several proteins (below). If this material was incubated with SDS, noncovalent interactions were altered such that VP3 protein was released and VPg-dsRNA complexes were obtained. Finally, purified dsRNA segments were obtained from E5 particles treated with SDS and proteinase K. Crude preparations of IBDV RNP were analyzed by electron microscopy and negative staining (Fig. 2a ) or by metal shadowing (Fig. 2b ).

Although the mechanisms of classical moonlighting rely on the use of separate surfaces for binding different partners and/or catalyzing distinct reactions, VP3 uses close or overlapping interaction regions to exert diverse effects. Reports are becoming more frequent of intrinsically unstructured proteins that are able to perform several functions, 33 as predicted here for the VP3 C-terminal region, which is invisible in the reported atomic structure of VP3, similar to the C-terminal domain of a transcriptional corepressor, CtBP. 34 Switching mechanisms among these VP3 functions are poorly understood. Coordination of their activities might be achieved by conformational changes in partner-induced processes (pVP2, VP1, dsRNA, or some combination of these), variations in oligomeric state, transient folded/ unfolded states, local concentration of a ligand at the viroplasms, or a combination of these possibilities.",

Polyomavirus and papovavirus (e.g., SV40) are icosahedral particles that contain within their capsids a mini chromosome in which circular dsDNA is folded into nucleosomes by cellular core histones.

Nevertheless, in this scenario, VP3 might compact the genome at the interior capsid through intermolecular interactions. The ability of VP3 to oligomerize supports this hypothesis; under certain conditions (i.e., in the presence of glycerol or Mg 2+ ), we detected thicker RNP filaments (not shown). Definition of RNP and VPg-dsRNA complexes at two well-defined electrophoretic mobility bands implies that, in addition to the covalently bound VPg, all dsRNA molecules have the same number of VP3 molecules. The most abundant class of IBDV particles is formed by the E5 population that encapsidates four dsRNA segments such that each segment is bound to \u223c110 VP3 molecules, yielding a ratio of 26 bp/molecule of VP3 (Luque, D., Rivas, G., Alfonso, C., Carrascosa, J. L., Rodr\u00edguez, J. F. & Cast\u00f3n, J. R. (2009). Infectious Bursal Disease Virus: an icosahedral polyploidy dsRNA virus. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. In press). This ratio, calculated assuming that 100% of VP3 molecules are bound to dsRNA, is relatively low as compared with the nucleocapsid protein of the paramyxovirus Sendai virus, which is bound to six ribonucleotides. 37 We are also working on the functional analysis to determine at what ratio the RNP properties become evident. The appearance of the RNP of negativesense (e.g., filovirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and orthomyxovirus) and positive-sense (e.g., coronaviruses) ssRNA viruses is highly variable, depending on salt concentration, deletion of specific C-or N-terminal regions, and/or the presence of specific ions. These RNPs form constrained, tightly packed coils with a fairly uniform diameter or flexible, extended linear structures. [38] [39] [40] T = 2 core versus RNP complexes dsRNA viruses share a structurally conserved core with T = 2 symmetry that surrounds the genome and whose structural integrity remains undisturbed throughout the viral cycle. Negative-strand and positive-strand syntheses occur within the T = 2 capsid, where the viral RNA polymerase is incorporated as an integral component. To avoid suppression of virus gene expression, the T = 2 capsid isolates dsRNA molecules or replicative intermediates from host molecules, preventing intracellular responses such as protein kinase R-mediated responses 3 and RNA interference mechanisms. All members of the Birnaviridae family lack the T = 2 core, and it is plausible that RNPs have acquired some functions associated to the T = 2 capsid. Our analyses demonstrate that, in contrast to most dsRNA viruses, 41 IBDV RNPs are functionally competent for RNA synthesis in a capsid-independent manner (and in the absence of VP2). The catalytic activity of VP1 is increased fivefold when VP3 is present, 20 resembling results obtained with negative-sense ssRNA viruses, in which the nucleoprotein-RNA complex (and not the naked viral RNA) serves as the actual template for the RdRp.",

Particles were then pelleted through a 25% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion (37,000 rpm, 2.5 h, 4\u00b0C) in a Beckman-Coulter SW41 rotor, followed by CsCl equilibrium gradient centrifugation (40,000 rpm, 14 h, 4\u00b0C) in a Beckman-Coulter NVT65 rotor, adjusting the initial density of the solution to 1.33 g/ml by CsCl addition. Six virus-containing bands were visible (designated as E1 to E6 from top to bottom), and E5 viral particles (the major band) were collected by needle insertion and aspiration into a syringe.
