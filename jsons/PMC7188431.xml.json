On March 14, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic with confirmed cases in 127 countries. This unprecedented load on healthcare institutions is particularly overwhelming for ICUs and medical personnel treating mechanically ventilated patients. The occurrence rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with COVID-19 infection varied between 17% and 41% (1\u20133). ARDS may require weeks of mechanical ventilation (MV) and is associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate. Worldwide, thousands of patients are denied life-saving support for lack of mechanical ventilators. This is unprecedented global emergency without a workable solution. Thus, any intervention directed at decreasing duration of MV and mortality could have a great impact on public health and national security.",

Since the first clinical description of ARDS (4), corticosteroids are the most broadly used medication specifically targeted at treatment. Translational research has established a strong association between dysregulated systemic inflammation and progression (maladaptive repair) or delayed resolution of ARDS. In patients with ARDS, glucocorticoid receptor-mediated down-regulation of systemic and pulmonary inflammation is essential to restore tissue homeostasis and accelerate resolution of diffuse alveolar damage and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction. This can be significantly enhanced with prolonged low-to-moderate dose corticosteroid treatment (CST) (5). The recent publication of a large confirmatory trial (6) provides stronger evidence that prolonged low-to-moderate dose CST is effective and safe for nonviral ARDS (mostly caused by bacterial pneumonia and sepsis).",

The analysis to support the Task Force\u2019s recommendations was limited to nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated methylprednisolone (n = 322) (7) and hydrocortisone (n = 494) treatment in ARDS for a duration of at least 7 days. The Task Force found moderate quality/certainty of evidence for a reduction in the duration of MV (mean difference, 7.1 d; 95% CI, 3.2\u201310.9 d) and improved survival (relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.89) and therefore made a conditional recommendation for methylprednisolone treatment (5). The high benefit/risk (therapeutic index) associated with the intervention supported their recommendation. Except for transient hyperglycemia (mostly within the 36 hr following an initial bolus), CST was not associated with increased risk for neuromuscular weakness, gastrointestinal bleeding, or nosocomial infections (very low certainty evidence) (5). Importantly, the survival benefit observed during hospitalization persisted after hospital discharge with follow-up observations extending up to 60 days (6, 8, 9), 4 months (10), 6 months (11), or 1 year (limit of measurement) (12). However, most trials were less than 100 patients and performed before the implementation of lung-protective MV. A larger confirmatory RCT in patients receiving low tidal volume (LTV) ventilation was missing.",

This latest RCT provided consistent evidence similar to what was observed in the previous meta-analyses. The aggregate data from 10 RCTs (n = 1,093) clearly demonstrate that CST is associated with a sizable reduction in duration of MV and hospital mortality.

            "text": "The WHO statement (17) of not recommending the routine use of corticosteroids for treatment of viral pneumonia outside clinical trials relies on incomplete evidence. If the evidence favors the use of corticosteroids in nonviral ARDS, why does the WHO not recommend CST for COVID-19-associated ARDS? There are limitations on the evidence approach used by WHO to reach a categorical decision with potentially serious public health repercussions. The WHO\u2019s brief argument to support the recommendation is mainly based on the risk of decreased viral clearance reported in one observational study (18) and inconclusive evidence from retrospective observational studies without a predesigned study protocol and subjected to cofounding (imbalances in baseline characteristics and postbaseline time-dependent patient differences that influence the decision to prescribe corticosteroids), and hidden bias (19). A more recent high-quality meta-analysis found a high correlation between CST and potential confounders for measured outcomes, such as disease severity and comorbid illnesses. Therefore, confounding by indication is likely to be a significant bias in studies which only provided unadjusted effect estimates. Additionally, time to hospitalization, antiviral use, presence of respiratory failure prior to corticosteroids, and the rationale for corticosteroid use or treatment regimen were sparsely reported across studies (20). What \u201ckills\u201d COVID-19 patients is dysregulated systemic inflammation. There is no evidence linking delayed viral clearance to worsened outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and it is unlikely that it would have a greater negative impact than the host own \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (13).",

This interpretation is biased and without evidence-based support (22). First, their \u201cconclusive\u201d statement rested on only four small studies without including results from another 25 publications (19). Six of the 10 studies in the referenced meta-analysis did not describe the CST used (23). Second, they ignored the positive findings of two large studies (5,327 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] [24] and 2,141 patients with influenza H1N1 pneumonia [25]) that evaluated the impact of time, dose, and duration of CST and reported a significant reduction in mortality with dosage and duration similar to the one recommended by SCCM and ESICM Task Force (5). In the SARS study, after adjustment for possible confounders, CST was safe and decreased the risk for death by 47% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35\u20130.82) (24).

Although there is a wide divergence of opinion in the literature on whether corticosteroids should be used in patients with COVID-19, the two largest studies on H1N1 and SARS (n = 7,568) (25, 27) lend support to its use. However, the lack of sufficient evidence is not tantamount with negating the plausible efficacy of corticosteroids in COVID-19-associated ARDS. The stronger evidence for nonviral ARDS, the early reports from China, and the recommendations from the frontlines of China and Italy should be considered. Inconclusive clinical evidence should not be a reason for abandoning CST in COVID-19-associated ARDS. RCTs are in progress (NCT04273321, NCT04244591, NCT04325061, and NCT04323592) and results will not be available for months. Until then, there is no justification based on available evidence and professional ethics to categorically deny the use of CST in severe life-threatening \u201ccytokine storm\u201d associated with COVID-19 in hospitals not involved in a RCT. Figure 3 shows the protocols most commonly used in patients with nonviral ARDS RCTs.",

The dosage is adjusted to ideal body weight and round up to the nearest 10 mg (i.e., 77 mg round up to 80 mg). Day 0, IV bolus (80 mg in 50 cc normal saline) over 30 min. Day 0-to ICU discharge: infusion is obtained by adding the daily dosage to 240 cc of normal saline and run at 10 cc/hr. If necessary, infusion can be changed to bolus every 6 hr (1/4 daily dose) or in the last 6 d very 12 hr (1/2 daily dose). Five days after the patient can ingest medications, methylprednisolone is administered orally in one single daily equivalent dose. Enteral absorption of methylprednisolone, and likely other corticosteroids, is compromised for days after extubation. If between days 1 to 14, the patient is extubated, the patient is advanced to day 15 of drug therapy and tapered according to schedule. Monitor anti-inflammatory response with daily measurements of C-reactive protein levels in addition to severity scores of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction. Rapid tapering can be associated with reconstituted systemic inflammation in the presence of suppressed adrenal function with worsening lung physiology and increased mortality risk (28). Urgent reinstitution of corticosteroid treatment is necessary to be followed after improvement by slow tapering. B, Dexamethasone treatment. Patients in the dexamethasone group received an IV dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. Treatment was maintained for a maximum of 10 d after randomization or until extubation (if occurring before day 10). An updated protocol mandates to give dexamethasone for a maximum of 10 d after randomization, independently of the intubation status. This protocol does not mandate further tapering for few days to minimize the risk for reconstituted systemic inflammation.",
