Ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined as pneumonia in those patients who have been intubated for at least two to three days, with worsening radiographic features, increasing secretions, bronchospasm, or hemoptysis, or with worsening status on the ventilator. While early treatment is essential, rapid de-escalation of antibiotics in the face of negative culture results is also important. Sampling of the respiratory tract is necessary to further guide management and noninvasive sampling is preferred [1]. Samples may be obtained either through tracheobronchial aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, mini-BAL, or protected specimen brush (PSB). Careful observation of individual hospitals\u2019 bacterial antibiogram is essential to provide treatment targeted to the resistance profile of each institution. The most common MDR pathogens include P. aeruginosa, Escheriochia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter species as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [2].",

Treatment escalation did not change the risk of death in this single-center study [3]. Unfortunately, treatment is often delayed. In one study among 107 patients, 30.7 % of patients had their therapy for VAP inappropriately delayed, defined as \u2265 24 h passing between VAP onset and providing the appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

However, more recent systematic reviews and the ATS/IDSA 2016 guideline [2] has challenged this distinction.

In one study, in 52 episodes of pneumonia, endotracheal aspirate was found to have a sensitivity of 97.7 % and specificity of 50 % as compared with protected brush specimen [17]. Other studies have employed the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) with a cut-off of 6 as a noninvasive method of identifying patients with VAP, using autopsy findings of pneumonia as the gold standard (Table 29.1) [18]. Fabregas et al. found a score of greater than 6 had a sensitivity of 77 % but a specificity of 42 % [19]. Conversely, bronchoscopic sampling may be less sensitive but is more specific for pneumonia. Randomized controlled trials are mixed. An RCT of 413 patients found no benefit to invasive sampling in unadjusted analyses, but did after adjustment for baseline factors [20]. A more recent RCT of 740 patients found no benefit to bronchoalveolar lavage over endotracheal aspirate [21]. Our practice is to perform immediate endotracheal aspirate in all patients with suspected VAP, but to reserve bronchoalveolar lavage or protected brush for selected cases.\n",

At 60 days, however, there was no difference in mortality rates, although nephrotoxicity did occur at greater rates with vancomycin [22]. As research in this space continues to evolve, linezolid may be a particularly good option among patients with renal failure, although current guidelines suggest either therapy for treatment.",

Current recommendations from the 2016 update are to prescribe 2 antipseudomonal antibiotics when patients have risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, when the prevalence of gram-negative isolates resistant to the proposed monotherapeutic agent exceds 10 %, and when antimicrobial susceptibaility rates are unavailable [2]. However, it is worth noting that synergy of medications has only been demonstrated in vitro and in neutropenic or bacteremic patients and one randomized controlled trial did not demonstrate differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy groups [6, 23, 24]. An observational cohort study in Lancet suggested combination therapy may be harmful, as the cohort of patients with ATS/IDSA-compliant antimicrobial therapy had a higher risk of death at 28 days than the noncompliant group [25]. This remains controversial, whether these individuals were at higher risk of death from the medications, the infections, or misidentification of them as at higher risk for MDR infection. Further research will be necessary to identify who, if anyone, should be receiving such broad antibiotic coverage from the outset.",

Review of radiology has been removed from the definition.

In contrast, Boudma and colleagues found ventilator-associated condition to be reasonably sensitive at identifying episodes of VAP (0.92) but not specific (0.28) [40]. Further, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome is likely to be captured alongside VAP under the larger label of VAE [39, 41].
