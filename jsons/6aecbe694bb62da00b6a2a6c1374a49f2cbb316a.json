The epidemic in Italy started on January 30 and, following the spread of cases throughout the whole country, the Government declared the lockdown for several activities and a series of tight restrictions on March 13 to prevent the further worsening of the situation. As we write, in Italy we have not yet reached the peak of the contagion curve and more than 110,500 cases and 13,000 deaths have been registered.",

The present situation has been well summarized by La Marca et al. (2020) with 'COVID-19: Lessons from the Italian Reproductive Medical Experience' (https://www.fertstertdialog.com/ users/16110-fertility-and-sterility/posts/62274-covid-19-inklings). We want to endorse their comprehensive and honest description. It is remarkable the authors' aim of accurately describing the measures adopted by Italian IVF clinics to face this unprecedented situation to educate and provide guidance for those countries that must cope with it in the weeks ahead. Even though this emergency demands the precaution of postponing new treatments, each IVF center is also a tissue center; therefore, actions must be taken to preserve fertility in oncologic patients, but above all to ensure the proper maintenance of cryogenic banks.",
