            "text": "The significance of the symbiotic relationship between the ruminant microflora and host animal is not well appreciated by the casual observer. However, when one considers that in the United States alone, over 42.8 million beef and dairy cows comprise the national herd and provide over 11.9 billion kg of beef and 82.5 billion kg of milk (USDA-NASS, 2007a,b), the economic importance of maintaining a healthy symbiotic relationship is staggering. Utilization of grain in ruminant diets leads to modifications of the rumen microflora that cause alterations in rumen fermentation patterns and health of the rumen and animal (Russell and Rychlik, 2001). The development of microbial manipulation techniques to maintain efficient production levels and a healthy rumen environment has been a priority for the ruminant nutritionist. New technologies to select for or against specific ruminal microorganisms can permit rumen microbe manipulation consistent with future constraints on antimicrobial use and environmental concerns.",

The PAP-Fn \u00d7 PAP-Sb interaction for G:F on a BW basis yielded the following feed efficiencies: 0.180, 0.185, 0.186, and 0.184 for control, only PAP-Fn, only PAP-Sb, and both PAP, respectively. On a BW basis, steers fed only PAP-Sb were more efficient (P < 0.05) than those fed no PAP. Nevertheless, when PAP-Fn was fed with or without PAP-Sb, feed efficiency was similar (P > 0.10) to steers fed no PAP. No differences (P > 0.10) in feed efficiency (BW basis) were found between steers fed either or both PAP. The PAP-Fn \u00d7 PAP-Sb interaction (P = 0.13) for G:F on a carcass-adjusted basis yielded the following feed efficiencies: 0.180, 0.181, 0.185, and 0.180 for control, only PAP-Fn, only PAP-Sb, and both PAP, respectively. When analyzed on carcass-adjusted basis, a tendency was found for steers fed only PAP-Sb to be more efficient than those fed both (P = 0.09) or no PAP (P = 0.07). No differences were found in feed efficiency (carcass weight-adjusted) between steers fed only PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn. This was partially due to a main effect of PAP-Fn feeding on dressing percentage. No effects of feeding PAP were observed for live and carcass weight-adjusted final BW, ADG (BW or carcass weight-adjusted basis), or DMI (Table 2). Regarding carcass characteristics, no significant (P > 0.10) PAP main effects or interactions between PAP were observed for HCW, fat thickness, LM area, KPH, yield grade, marbling score, quality grade, or percentage of abscessed livers.

When analyzing the G:F response on a carcass-adjusted basis, the differences with the BW basis responses were largely due to the main effect of PAP-Fn on dressing percentage, in which PAP-Fn seemed to increase weight of noncarcass components. Average daily gain of cattle treated with PAP-Fn was numerically less when calculated from HCW than when calculated from BW. This difference reflects the decreased dressing percentage of the PAP-Fn treatment. Reasons for this effect on dressing percentage remain unknown. Because the only other variable in the 2 experiments with a similar response (PAP-Fn main effect) was severity of abscessed livers, we suggest a possible link between liver metabolism and final weight of noncarcass components. The economic significance of a treatment that affects dressing percentage without concurrent effects on HCW is minimal, because the unit of sale typically is carcass mass, not percentage. Carcass-adjusted ADG reflects carcass rates of gain (Goodrich and Meiske, 1971), and the lack of difference in HCW or carcass-adjusted ADG demonstrates that, in spite of the decreased dressing percentage, cattle fed PAP-Fn had similar carcass ADG as cattle fed no PAP-Fn. The reduction in severity of liver abscesses observed when feeding PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb when compared with control or steers receiving only PAP-Sb may be directly related to the reduction in ruminal counts of F. necrophorum observed in Exp. 2 when feeding PAP-Fn. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the primary etiological agent in the development of liver abscess (Nagaraja and Chengappa, 1998), and strategies that inhibit F. necrophorum in the rumen, the liver, or both decrease the liver abscess incidence (Nagaraja et al., 1999).",

A greater ruminal pH in the first 4 h after feeding was observed for all the treatments receiving PAP-Fn along with less ruminal NH3-N concentration for all the PAP treatments. A lesser ruminal pH (below 6.0) in the early hours after feeding in steers not fed PAP-Fn may have decreased fiber and protein digestibility. As reported by Kovacik et al. (1986), a ruminal pH of 6.0 has been established as the threshold below which both proteolytic and cellulolytic activities are greatly decreased.

Streptococcus bovis is perhaps the primary etiological agent in the development of ruminal acidosis and also is involved in other detrimental metabolic processes such as wasteful deamination and excess production of lactic acid (Russell et al., 1981; Owens et al., 1998; Griswold et al., 1999). Indeed, in the first 4 h after feeding, steers fed either PAP had less rumen NH3-N than those fed no PAP. Thus, feeding PAP-Sb may have decreased deamination and prevented a decline in rumen pH associated with feeding, thereby leading to greater efficiency of N capture as protein and enhanced digestion during at least the first 4 h after feeding. Steers fed PAP-Fn also had less rumen NH3-N and greater pH during the first 4 h after feeding, and their G:F was intermediate relative to that of those fed no PAP and those fed PAP-Sb.",

            "text": "Even though effects on ruminal NH3-N were transient and restricted to the first 4 h after feeding, effects of PAP on protein metabolism may partially explain the performance differences observed in Exp. 1. A reduction in ruminal NH3-N in the first hours after feeding may indicate a decreased dietary protein deamination in the rumen (Russell et al., 1981) by steers supplemented with either PAP alone or in combination. A reduction in the rate of ruminal protein degradation in situ was described previously when PAP-Sb was fed alone or in combination with PAP-Fn (DiLorenzo et al., 2005). Excess of ruminal NH3-N may lead to greater concentrations of NH3 circulating in blood and an associated energetic cost for converting excess NH3 into urea for excretion (McBride and Kelly, 1990); this in turn can affect animal performance (Russell et al., 1981; Legleiter et al., 2005). Hristov and Broderick (1994) reported optimum ruminal NH3-N concentrations for bacterial protein synthesis in the range of 3.6 to 6.1 mM. The effects of feeding only PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb on ruminal S. bovis counts support the theory that deamination was decreased, which would have enhanced N metabolism in rumen. Besides its main role in the development of ruminal acidosis and starch fermentation, S. bovis has been recognized widely as one of the main proteolytic organisms in the rumen (Russell et al., 1981; Griswold et al., 1999). When feeding PAP-Fn only, or PAP-Sb only, significant reductions in ruminal S. bovis counts were observed; however, when both PAP were combined, S. bovis ruminal counts were similar to those in the control group. The nature of the interaction between the 2 PAP remains unknown, but similarities in terms of interactions on ruminal S. bovis counts and on feed efficiency are of interest.",

The hypothetical mechanisms by which the reduction in target ruminal bacterial counts is exerted also was described by DiLorenzo et al. (2006) and may be related to the binding activity of the antigen (S. bovis) to PAP-Sb and inhibition of bacterial growth. An inhibitory effect of specific avian-derived antibodies on target microorganisms has been demonstrated previously both in vitro and in vivo (Kuroki et al., 1997; Sunwoo et al., 2002; Cook et al., 2005). Ruminal counts of F. necrophorum (Exp. 2) were in agreement with those reported in previous studies, in which similar doses of monensin and tylosin were fed (Coe et al., 1999; DiLorenzo et al., 2006). Because 300 mg of monensin/d and 90 mg of tylosin/d were fed to all steers from the beginning of the experiment, and were not part of the treatments as in DiLorenzo et al. (2006), ruminal F. necrophorum counts in Exp. 2 at d 0 were less (for all treatments) than those reported by DiLorenzo et al. (2006) when no tylosin was fed. Reductions in ruminal counts of F. necrophorum were not observed after an additional 19 d of tylosin feeding (control diet). However, feeding PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) for 19 d caused a further reduction in ruminal counts of F. necrophorum. This effect may be due to differences in the modes of action of tylosin and PAP-Fn that could produce additive or synergistic effects when both feed additives are fed.",

This could be explained by the fact that, in spite of playing a major role in the development of lactic acidosis, the contribution of S. bovis to the total counts of ruminal microorganisms is relatively small, as has been observed on recent studies that utilize modern molecular techniques for quantification of rumen microorganisms (Stevenson and Weimer, 2007). The lack of detection of ruminal lactic acid in any of the treatments (Exp. 2) is in agreement with previous studies reporting similar ranges in ruminal pH (Coe et al., 1999; Cardozo et al., 2006). The lack of accumulation of lactate in ruminal fluid may be explained by the high mean daily ruminal pH observed in Exp. 2 (5.76 to 6.04). At a ruminal pH greater than 5.5, fermentation of lactate by ruminal bacteria typically exceeds the rate of lactic acid production (Asanuma and Hino, 2005), but once the ruminal pH decreases below 5.5, ruminal lactate-utilizing bacteria are inhibited so ruminal lactate can accumulate (Kung and Hession, 1995; Owens et al., 1998; Nagaraja and Titgemeyer, 2007).",

Effects on animal performance may be explained partially by changes in the ruminal microbial ecosystem related to reductions in counts of S. bovis and some effects on ruminal fermentation metabolism. Feeding PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb led to decreased severity of liver abscesses. Avian PAP present an alternative new technology with the potential to enhance feed efficiency and decrease liver abscesses.
