            "text": "COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]).3 The outbreak started in December 2019, and then spread at an unprecedented rate throughout the world. The disease causes respiratory illness with symptoms including cough, fever, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. Althoughmost people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, COVID-19 can be serious and even fatal. Older people and people with coexisting medical conditions could be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. The outbreak of COVID-19 could be particularly risky for health care workers because of their ongoing professional exposure to the virus. Atpresent, health care practitioners are the most valuable resource for every country to combat the disease, and we believe that health care workers need to be well protected first, especially anesthesiologists who play a vital role in emergency airway management, intensive care, and perioperative medicine. Here, we review the different stages of COVID-19 development in China, focusing on the personal protection of health care workers and the risk factors related to their infection.",

We would like to point out that the key element of full precaution is the complete coverage of the head and facial skin, which does not necessarily mean a conjoined hood or even powered air-purifying respirator system as previously reported.11 Based on our experience, a surgical mask in addition to the N95 mask to cover the remaining bare skin on face, together with goggles and face shield, have worked well (Figure 1).",
