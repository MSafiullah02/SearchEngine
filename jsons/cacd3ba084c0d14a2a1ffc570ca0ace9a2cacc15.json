In fact, these conditions are the primary indications for outpatient antibiotic prescriptions.

The incubation period varies between 48 and 72 h. While a low-grade fever in some cases is present, in adults, temperature elevation is rare. Early symptoms may be minimal and limited to malaise and nasal symptoms. The nasal discharge is initially clear and watery. There is a subsequent transition period where the nasal discharge becomes viscous, opaque, and discolored (white, yellow, green) [2] . The color of the secretions is not predictive of a bacterial infection. The clinical presentation is similar in both adults and children. The episode tends to be self-limited. The median duration of a cold is 1 week, with most patients improving by the 10th day; however, lingering symptoms may last up to 2 weeks.",

It is unclear why this variation exists, although it may be related to increased crowding of indoor populations in the colder months.

In eight trials of antimicrobial treatment of URIs, six found no difference between the groups either in terms of improvement or in terms of complications. Complications tend to be minimal and occur at a rate of 10-15%. One trial found some slight benefit in decreasing the presence of purulent rhinitis [23] . Another found a decrease in rhinorrhea at day 5 but no difference between the groups at day 10 [24] . Similarly, an additional trial attempted to isolate \"bacterial colds\" for which antibiotics might be effective treatments [25] .

The clinical impression of the treating physician has been shown to be fairly inaccurate at making this differentiation [69] [70] [71] . A clinical prediction rule for presence of strep throat that has some utility uses the presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate. No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat [72] . Another dilemma in identifying group A strep in patients with pharyngitis is the sensitivity of rapid group A antibody kits compared to a throat culture. Many studies have shown that a rapid test is less sensitive than the culture for identifying the presence of group A strep. The rapid tests have a high degree of specificity, but their sensitivity in clinical practice can be unacceptably low. Sensitivities for the rapid test compared to a standard blood agar culture vary considerably but are generally in the range of 60-70%. Studies also have demonstrated that in circumstances when the colony counts are low, rapid tests are more likely to miss the presence of group A streptococcus. However, when the seroconversion of ASO titers is used as the gold standard for infection, rapid tests perform very well [69] . It is likely that rapid tests miss patients who have a small number of organisms and who are likely to be colonized instead of infected. Thus, rapid testing may be more specific in identifying patients with actual strep-related disease than cultures, which also identify those who are likely to be carriers. This comparison suggests that follow-up throat cultures are not necessary and may actually confuse treatment decisions. Rapid strep testing without culture also has been shown to be the most cost-effective approach to managing acute pharyngitis [73] .",

These conditions are self-limited and currently are optimally treated with symptomatic medicines. \u2022 Although the data are mixed regarding the utility of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis, otitis media, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics may have some benefit. Short-course therapy with narrow-spectrum antibiotics appropriate for the likely pathogen is recommended.",
