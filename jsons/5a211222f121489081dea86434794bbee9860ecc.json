            "text": "Purpose: To describe surgical technique and outcomes in 2 southern rockhopper and 3 macaroni penguins undergoing bilateral phacoemulsification. Methods: Avisual penguins with hypermature cataracts were identified from a captive population. Combined rod-cone standard flash electroretinography and ocular ultrasound were performed. Phacoemulsification was performed via a 3.2 mm incision using a one-or two-handed technique. Incisions were closed with 9-0 vicryl monofilament suture in continuous or interrupted pattern. Topical and systemic anti-inflammatories and antibiotics were administered post-operatively. Slitlamp biomicroscopy and rebound tonometry were performed at 1-2 week intervals until inflammation resolved and medications were discontinued. Behavioral data was collected for 4 individuals for 2 weeks pre and post surgery. Results: Aspiration through the phaco needle was sufficient to remove the majority of the lens material in all eyes. In 9 out of 10 eyes the lens capsule was completely luxated or severely subluxated and removed via the corneal incision. Postoperative uveitis was minimal in all eyes. Inflammation along the dorsolateral edge of the membrana nictitans (MN) developed in all eyes. Defects of the dorsal edge of the MN developed in 6 of 10 eyes during the first post-operative week. One MN also developed a full-thickness 5 mm central hole. MN healing correlated with suture dissolution and was complete within 8 weeks in all eyes. Behavioral data showed a significant increase in use of the habitat space (p < 0.05) and feeding behavior (p < 0.05) post surgery. Conclusions: Phacoemulsification carries a good prognosis in these species and improves activity level. MN defects may have been related to suture irritation and smaller suture gauge or alternative corneal closure methods should be considered for these species. None.",

            "text": "Purpose: Describe the use of tissue adhesive for treatment of erosive lipid keratopathy in two Panamian Golden Frogs (PGF) (Atelopus zeteki). Methods: Two PGFs were presented with bilateral corneal disease. Both had unilateral corneal rupture and contralateral deep axial stromal loss. Frogs were anesthestized for unilateral enucleation of ruptured globes. Treatment with N-butyl cyanoacrylate was elected for the contralateral eyes which were considered at risk for rupture. A single drop of proparacaine was applied topically to eyes with stromal loss. Weck-Cel sponges were used to lightly debride and thoroughly dry corneal surfaces. A single drop of N-butyl cyanoacrylate was placed on the tip of a clean, dry Weck-Cel swab and applied with a dabbing motion covering the area of stromal loss and extending 3-4 mm beyond the affected area. Results: Enucleation sites healed without complication. Histopathology of enucleated eyes confirmed the diagnosis of lipid keratopathy. Tissue glue re-application was required at 1 week. Subsequent retention was good with tissue glue still adherent at 2 and 4 weeks post procedure. The axial corneas of both frogs were thickened post adhesive extrusion as assessed by slit lamp biomicroscopy indicating improved integrity. No corneal vessels were noted by slit lamp biomicroscopy at any time period pre or post operatively. No recurrence of corneal lesions was noted. Serial body weight measurements were stable to increased over the 1 year follow up period. Conclusions: N-butyl cyanoacrylate is an effective treatment for progressive lipid keratopathy with compromise of corneal integrity. PGF survival is not affected by unilateral enucleation. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 003 Penetrating corneal xenotransplantation of SPF pig corneas to a dog: a preliminary study Purpose: To examine the effectiveness of Yorkshire pig (Large-White X Landrace) cornea for full thickness transplantation to a dog. Methods: Penetrating corneal xenotransplantation was performed using SPF Yorkshire pig cornea to a dog. Topical 2% cyclosporine was applied three times daily for 4 weeks postoperatively. Xenograft was evaluated by slit lamp microscopy, ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and in vivo confocal corneal microscope (IVCM) 3 months after surgery. The recipient eye was enucleated for corneal histopathological staining 91 days after surgery. Results: Characteristics of immune rejection of the xenograft with increased edema and progressive vascularization were seen on post-operative day 16. However, 60% of the xenograft area had improved transparency 3 months after surgery. Using OCT, part of the xenograft was thickened and irregular compared to the peripheral cornea. Using IVCM, the central cornea displayed loss of lamellar organization with replacement by a random, haphazard arrangement. On histopathological examination, the xenograft was infiltrated with inflammatory cells. Thirty percent of the cornea displayed stromal degeneration and Descemet's membrane rupture. Conclusions: Clinical and histologic rejection of pig-to-dog penetrating corneal xenograft occurred, however, it achieved tectonic stability and 60% of xenograft had improved transparency by 3 months after surgery. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 004 Intraocular mast cell tumors in dogs Purpose: To describe the morphology of intraocular mast cell tumors in dogs. Methods: The COPLOW database was searched for intraocular mast cell tumors in dogs and cats. Histological slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and giemsa. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD-117. Results: Four cases of intraocular mast cell tumors were identified in dogs, and no intraocular mast cell tumors were identified in cats. Of the four tumors one was in a patient with a metastatic grade 3 mast cell tumor and was presumed to be a metastatic lesion and had a mitotic index of 5 per high power field. Three cases were presumed to be primary intraocular lesions. The presumed metastatic lesion extended throughout the anterior and posterior uvea, exfoliated into the anterior and posterior chambers and invaded the sclera. The presumed primary mass lesions affected predominantly the anterior uvea, two of which infiltrated the choroid; one was a solitary lesion in the ciliary body. Giemsa highlighted metachromatic granules in neoplastic cells of 3/4 cases, including the metastatic lesion, and CD-117 labeled positive in all cases. Lymphoplasmacytic uveitis was present in all cases and eosinophils were seen in 3/4 cases. All four cases had histological or clinical evidence of glaucoma. Conclusions: Canine intraocular mast cell tumors are rare lesions in dogs and there are no examples of these tumors in cats. None.

            "text": "Purpose: To describe the bacterial flora of the normal conjunctiva of the American Bison (Bison bison). Methods: Conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes of 15 American bisons, following a complete ophthalmic examination. The swabs were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Identification was performed primarily using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry and supplemented with conventional methods. Results: All 15 animals were found to be free of ocular disease that may affect the results of the culture. A total of 11 bacterial genera, and no fungal isolates were cultured. The most frequent bacteria isolates were Arthrobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Other bacteria included Pseudomonas spp., Pantoea spp., Staphylococcus spp., Entercoccus spp., Escherichia coli, Saccharothrix syringae, Jonesia denitrificans, Bacillus cereus, and Mirobacterium keratanolyticum. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the normal bacterial conjunctival flora in the American Bison (Bison bison). None. ABSTRACT NO.: 006 Complex maxillary malformation with orbital zygomatic mucocele in a puppy: a case report Purpose: To describe a zygomatic gland mucocele and concomitant maxillary malformation in a dog. A 7-month-old, male, mixed breed dog had a recent-onset of unilateral exophthalmos with third eyelid protrusion and a gradually enlarged swelling in the right temporal region. Methods: Physical and ophthalmic examinations, imaging, surgery and histology of the lesion were performed. Results: A compressing, painful right retrobulbar mass was clinically suspected and confirmed by ultrasound. Computed tomography revealed a large multiloculated cystic-like lesion of the right zygomatic gland projecting into the orbital space, displacing the eyeball. The ipsilateral molar part of the maxillary bone were underdeveloped with multiple abnormal unerupted mandibular crowded molar teeth in the premolar region. Modified lateral orbitotomy and selective caudal maxillary bone access were performed to provide ventral exposure of the orbit and dental extraction, while minimizing trauma to the globe and supporting structures. The pseudocyst was removed and the wall sampled for histology. Sections were characterized by acini of zygomatic gland embedded in a thick granulation tissue delineated in a border by abundant fibrin and amorphous hyaline homogeneous material (salivary secretion), partially infiltrated by macrophages consistent with sialocele. Clinical and imaging examinations six months after surgery showed no recurrence of the mucocele or ocular implications. Conclusions: We described a complex case of exophthalmos due to zygomatic mucocele in a puppy with ipsilateral maxillary hypoplasia. A possible relationship between these two conditions could be hypothesized on the basis of advanced imaging features. Early diagnosis and management prevented later ocular complications. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 007 Establishing normals for and validating the Pentacam-HR \u00e2 for anterior segment tomography in healthy feline eyes Purpose: To measure central corneal thickness (CCT) and anterior segment parameters in healthy feline eyes with the Pentacam-HR \u00e2 , a rotating Scheimpflug camera, and to compare these CCT values with those obtained with a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) device, the Optovue \u00e2 iVue. Methods: Repeated CCT measurements were obtained from both eyes of 35 healthy domestic shorthaired cats using SD-OCT and Pentacam-HR \u00e2 . Additional anterior segment parameters were evaluated with Pentacam-HR \u00e2 . The continuous data on CCT and age were compared between the modalities and between eyes using linear regression analysis for association. Bland-Altman analysis was used to evaluate agreement between the imaging modalities for CCT. Results: Mean AE SD CCT was 589.1 AE 42.9 lm for OD and 586.9 AE 40.4 lm OS using SD-OCT, with no significant difference between eyes. Mean AE sd CCT was 604.1 AE 61.6 lm for OD and 603.7 AE 77.1 lm OS using Pentacam-HR \u00e2 , with no significant difference between eyes. Flattest keratometric value was 43.1 AE 71.2 diopters (D). Steepest keratometric value was 66.7 AE 317.1 D. Anterior chamber depth was 4.4 AE 1.0 mm and angle was 36.1 AE 19.6\u00b0. Corneal volume was 59.5 AE 57.4 mm 3 . Astigmatism was 45.3 AE 335.8D. There was a significant difference between Pentacam and OCT values for CCT with OCT values on average 15.9 lm lower than Pentacam values (P = 0.02). There was moderate agreement between modalities based on Bland-Altman. Conclusions: The Pentacam provides valuable anterior segment parameters in feline eyes. There is moderate agreement between modalities, with CCT SD-OCT reading an average of 15.9 lm lower than Pentacam-HR \u00e2 .

Methods: A randomized, masked, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed using 12 clinically normal beagles divided into two treatment groups (n = 6 per group). 12-h baseline IOPs were established prior to treatment. Dogs in each group received one treatment in both eyes of either DHTM or a control solution (Blink Contacts \u00e2 , Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064). IOPs were measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h post-treatment. After a 72-h washout period, treatment groups were reversed. Results: Treatment with DHTM resulted in a significant IOP decrease compared to the control solution and baseline values at all time points beginning 2 h after administration. Peak effect was observed 6 h after treatment and continued throughout the study period. Time 0 IOP for the control group in treatment period 2 was also significantly decreased compared to baseline IOP, time 0 IOP in both DHTM treatment groups and time 0 IOP for the control group in period 1. Conclusions: In normotensive canine eyes, topical administration of DHTM effectively lowers IOP within 2 h of administration, reaching peak effect by 6 h, with a detectable IOP-lowering effect lasting >72 h. Further study is warranted to determine total duration of action of DHTM in dogs.",

            "text": "Purpose: To characterize the in vivo confocal microscopic features of dogs with macroscopic and microscopic corneal foreign bodies. Methods: Seven clinical cases presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (Ithaca, NY) with corneal foreign bodies detected on clinical examination or clinical findings consistent with foreign bodies were examined by corneal in vivo confocal microscopy. The diagnosis and type of corneal foreign body were confirmed by clinical examination or histopathology. All dogs received a complete ophthalmic examination prior to in vivo confocal microscopy that included slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, Schirmer I tear testing, applanation tonometry, and fluorescein stain. In vivo confocal microscopy was performed with a modified Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II and Rostock Cornea Module using a 639 objective and 400 lm field lens. Examinations were performed using only topical anesthesia and manual restraint. Following examination, retained digital images were analyzed for pathology. Results: In vivo confocal microscopy was helpful in all cases to establish a diagnosis and characterize corneal pathology. Analyzed images showed evidence of stromal leukocyte infiltration, anterior stromal dendritic cell proliferation, and corneal vascularization. Identified corneal foreign bodies included bone fragments, unidentified plant materials, a seed hull, metallic bullet fragments, and a wooden thorn. All dogs made recovered following surgical and/or medical intervention. Conclusions: In vivo confocal microscopy provides an excellent diagnostic technique to detect and characterize superficial, deep, ulcerative, or non-ulcerative corneal lesions secondary to both organic and non-organic corneal foreign bodies in dogs.

ABSTRACT NO.: 010 Corneal-protective effects of tear substitutes containing sodium hyaluronate (SH)/dodecahydrosqualene (DHS) with poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) on porcine dry eye model and assessment of adverse effects of the substitute in live rabbit eyes E 1 8 a b s t r a c t s ABSTRACT NO.: 013 Bilateral phacoemulsification followed by an acrylic foldable intraocular lens implantation in a 2.5 year-old Bengal Tigress (Panthera tigris tigris): case report Purpose: Evaluate the antioxidant role of intracameral ascorbic acid on the corneal endothelium of dogs submitted to phacoemulsification. Methods: The eyes of 10 dogs with bilateral senile cataracts were used. Sterile ascorbic acid was added to the irrigation solution used during phacoemulsification to make a final ascorbic acid concentration of 0.001 M. Endothelial cell density (cells/mm 2 ) and area (mm 2 ), corneal thickness (mm), hexagonality (%) and the coefficient of variation (%) in cell size were evaluated by noncontact specular microscopy (Topcon SP 3000P). Evaluations were conducted prior to the surgical procedure (M0), immediately after (M1) and on postoperative days (PODs) 7 (M2), 14 (M3), 28 (M4), 60 (M5) and 90 (M6). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Results: Endothelial cell densities were 2101 no significant differences between PODs compared with M0 (p > 0.05). Cell area increased significantly at M5 (581.0 AE 89.42) compared with M0 (473.5 AE 65.84; p < 0.05). Regarding corneal thickness, hexagonality and the coefficient of variation in cell size, no difference was verified between PODs (p > 0.05). Conclusions: No significant losses in cell density, corneal thickness, hexagonality and coefficient of variation were observed, with the addition of intracameral 0.001 M ascorbic acid in the irrigation solution used during phacoemulsification. An increase in cell area was only verified for M5.

There are, however, certain concerns with AM, including its structural heterogeneity and method of manipulation. To circumvent these concerns, synthetic membranes have been proposed as replacements for AM. Evidence suggests that membranes from chitosan (Chi), alginate (Alg) and fucoidan (Fuc) are candidates for limbal therapy. This study evaluated immunophenotypic patterns, chromatin functional states and amounts of DNA from LECs grown on membrane from Alg-Chi-Fuc and AM. Methods: Chi-Alg-Fuc membranes were fabricated by ionic and thermal reticulation. Cryopreserved (\u00c080\u00b0C) intact human AM was obtained from the tissue bank of the CASO-UNIFESP. LECs were obtained from rabbit limbal explants and then cultured on Algi-Chi-Fuc membrane or AM for 14 days. Differentiated and progenitor immunophenotypic patterns of the cornea were studied with anti-k3/k67 and anti-p63 antibodies. The Feulgen reaction was used to detect chromatin/DNA. The samples were evaluated under an optical microscope coupled with software for image analysis (Image J \u00e2 , NIH). Optical density (OD) and integrated optical density (IOD) related to the functional states of chromatin and the amounts of DNA were quantified. Results: LECs cultured on Alg-Chi-Fuc membrane and AM showed no differences in the expression of k3/k67 (p = 0.21). Expression of p63 was two-fold greater in samples grown on AM (6.25% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). The mean OD values were 0.57 AE 0.01 for LECs cultured on Algi-Chi-Fuc membrane and 0.54 AE 0.01 for cells grown on AM (p < 0.0001). Mean IOD values were higher for cells grown on Algi-Chi-Fuc membrane (25.18 AE 12.08 vs. 23.06 AE 11.12 on AM, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Membrane from Alg-Chi-Fuc is a viable substrate for expanding LECs. The cells grown on this substrate presented more condensed chromatin and DNA than cells expanded on AM.

Methods: Four dogs with a null mutation in the gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) were used. Autologous bone marrow cells were isolated and grown in culture to enrich for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Passage 3 MSCs were transduced with rAAV2-TPP1 vectors to produce and secrete TPP1 enzyme. Transduced cells were injected into the vitreous of one eye at 3-4 months of age; the contralateral eye served as a control. Quantitative CLN2 disease-related retinal lesion area analysis, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinography (ERG) were evaluated as visual biomarkers. Results: At ages younger than 9 months, ERG amplitudes were improved in treated eyes compared with control eyes. In addition, the treatment reduced the numbers and sizes of the CLN2 disease-related retinal lesions. Treatment effects on these biomarkers appear to wane by 8-9 months of age. Conclusions: Intravitreal ex vivo gene therapy delays progression of retinal disease in the canine model of CLN2 disease. Approaches for extending the duration of the therapeutic benefit are currently under investigation.

Methods: Freshly enucleated normal pig and horse eyes were used. Using the novel injection device, 50-100 ll of trypan blue was injected into central cornea or suprachoroidal space at the 12 o'clock position 5 or 10 mm posterior to the limbus for the pig and horse, respectively, using progressively longer needles. The eyes were frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C for 24 h then sectioned sagittally. Photographs of the corneal injections were taken, and then the internal ocular structures were removed to view and photograph the suprachoroidal space. Length of the needle was correlated to location of injection for each species. Results: Ten pig and six horse eyes were injected intracorneally and suprachoroidally.

Use of a needle length <650 lm caused the dye to leak from the bevel of the needle. For both the pig and horse eyes, 1200 lm was the most consistent needle length for effective injection of dye into the suprachoroidal space. Conclusions: Ocular injections using a precision ocular injection device was feasible and consistent. With appropriate needle lengths known, further evaluation in vivo is warranted.

Methods: The corneal-protective effects of 0.1% or 0.3% SH/ 5% DHS with or without PVA were evaluated using ivEPDRM with methylene blue (MB) or lissamine green (LG). Adverse effects of 0.3% SH/5% DHA with 0.1% PVA were assessed by ophthalmic examinations of live rabbit eyes administered the drug. Results: 0.1 % PVA supplementation resulted in the increased corneal-protective effects in the tear substitutes of both 0.1% SH/5% DHS and 0.3% SH/5% DHS. There were no significant differences in MB and LG staining between control eyes treated continuously with saline and 0.1% SH/5% DHS with PVA at 90 minutes of desiccation on ivEPDRM, whereas no significant differences were found in MB and LG staining between control eyes and ones treated with 0.3% SH/5% DHS with 0.1%PVA at 240 minutes of desiccation in the model.

Methods: Littermate dogs with distinct genotypes were used in this study, including: T4RRHO affected, double-affected and non-affected dogs. At 7 wk of age, under anesthesia the dogs had their left eye exposed to a single dose of white light (corneal irradiance of 1 mW/cm 2 for 1 min) with a monocular Ganzfeld. The right eye was shielded and used as control. ONL thickness was measured by non-invasive cSLO/sdOCT imaging before (6 wk of age) and 2 wk after light exposure (LE) (9 wk of age). Results: Prior to LE (6 wk of age) the ONL in both eyes of double-affected dog was significantly (~50%) thinner than that of the T4R RHO affected and normal dogs. Between 6 and 9 wk of age there was a similar decrease (~20%) in ONL thickness in both the exposed and the shielded eyes of the double-affected dog. A severe thinning of the ONL (~85%) was seen during that period in the exposed eye of the T4RRHO affected dog. The ONL thickness from the T4RRHO (shielded) and the non-affected (shielded/exposed) retinas decreased by only~7%, and was likely due to age-related thinning of the ONL associated with eye growth. Conclusion: Our results show that significant loss of photoreceptors is already present as early as at 6 week-old double-mutant RHO T4R/+ /RPE65 -/-, but that it is not-sensitive to light-damage. These findings further support the claim that 11-cis retinal is critical in stabilizing mutant T4R rod opsin, and that release of the chromophore upon photo-activation may lead to a change in conformation of the apoprotein that disrupts the structural integrity of discal membranes.

Methods: Forty-two anterior capsules from 42 dogs with primary mature cataract were obtained by phacoemulsification. With the approval of our university's animal research committee, the anterior capsules of 5 clinically healthy beagles were removed immediately after the dogs were euthanized other than for the study purposes and used as normal, control capsules. Anterior capsules were stained with toluidine blue and observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Cells attached to the anterior capsules were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Hitachi ionic liquid for preventing charge-up, and analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) . Results: The cell types observed in the anterior capsules of dogs with mature cataract were classified as cuboidal, spindle, fiber-like, pyknotic, and necrotic, while those seen in the control capsules were cuboidal and pyknotic. SEM revealed that the intercellular spaces of epithelial cells in mature cataracts were loosened more than those seen in the control capsules. EDS showed the presence of calcium-rich particles attached to cells on the anterior capsule in mature cataracts. Conclusion: Morphological changes of lens epithelial cells in mature cataracts may perhaps be the cause of the presence of calcium-rich particles, as calcium is known to be elevated in most lenses with cataracts. None Purpose: This case report intends to describe the preparation, technique and results obtained in a bilateral cataract surgery utilizing phacoemulsification and foldable acrylic intraocular lens in Bengal Tigress. Case report: A 2.5 year-old intact female Bengal Tigress was examined due to severe visual deficits and after sedation a complete eye exam revealed a bilateral mature cataract. Ultrasound, electroretinography, tonometry and complete blood work were performed before the surgery and were within the normal limits. Bimanual phacoemulsification technique was utilized and both eyes operated at same procedure. Intraocular custom made lenses specifications were: power of 30 D, overall length of 21 mm, 12 mm biconvex optical zone and haptic angulation of 0 0 . Comments: Anterior capsule was very elastic and thin making the capsulorhexis easier. Central part of the lens was very hard and took a long time for fragmentation and aspiration. Intraocular lens were injected into the capsular bag using a folding forceps. Post-operative drugs consisted of antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. No Elizabethan collar was utilized because the animal was training before the procedure to get used to eye drops. No important inflammation was observed after the procedure and the patient was totally visual 3 days after the procedure. Commercial interest: None.",

Case report: An eleven year-old, spayed female Shih-Tzu was examined due to severe ocular pain in the right eye. A complete eye exam revealed a superficial traumatic ulcer that treatment prescribed was topical antibiotics, autologous serum and artificial tears. Recheck was done 6 days later and healing process was considered normal. By the 12th day the cornea was totally healed and a cloudiness of the cornea was present and topical steroids plus artificial tears prescribed for 3 weeks were prescribed. After a 4 weeks of the initial presentation a clockwise vortex (whorl pattern) was noticed on the central part of the cornea and a slight fluorescein uptake identified and a diagnosis of hurricane keratopathy made. Comments: Hurricane keratopathy is the name given to the whorl pattern, highlighted with fluorescein, seen in situations where corneal epithelial cell turnover is exaggerated. In humans it differs from cornea verticillata in that the pattern is highlighted by fluorescein uptake and does not represent the deposition of any substance, and the causes are corneal grafts and chronic epithelial breakdown and healing. The hypothesis for the patterned observed is probably the response of corneal epithelial cells to ocular electromagnetic field. Commercial interest: None.",

Methods: The fresh sclerae were harvested and samples were mounted between the donor and receptor compartments onto the curved surface of Franz cells and maintained at 37\u00b0C. Solutions containing 10 and 100 mg/mL of DEX were dispensed into the donor compartments. Samples were collected from the receptor sites at time intervals. The sclerae and residual solutions in the donor chambers were collected at the end of each run. The collected samples were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography. The flux, permeability coefficient (Papp) and effective diffusion coefficient were calculated. Permeability parameters were compared with t-test statistical analysis (p < 0.05). Results: DEX had diffused through all species sclerae. Rabbit demonstrated the highest percent permeability and recovery. It appeared that increasing the concentration by one order of magnitude increased the percent recovery in equine, which may indicate that these species may benefit from higher concentration to reach maximum scleral permeability. The difference of percent recovery between two concentrations was negligible. Conclusions: A hydrophilic steroid anti-inflammatory drug model was able to permeate the sclerae in the selected species in this experiment. It suggested an interspecies difference pertaining to the drug diffusion across the sclera. This suggests a possible use of transscleral route as an alternative drug delivery method for translational research and development for the treatment of retinal diseases in veterinary ophthalmology.

            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate the effects of 1% lidocaine in pupil diameter and corneal endothelial parameters of rabbit eyes with uveitis. Methods: Uveitis was induced by paracentesis of the anterior chamber in the left eye of twenty rabbits. Twelve hours later ten rabbits received 0.2 mL of preservative-free 1% lidocaine through the same method (treated group-TG); the others received 0.9% NaCl (non treated group-NTG). The pupil diameter (PD) was evaluated by pachymetry for 60 min. Measurements were made at one minute intervals in the first ten minutes, five minutes from the tenth to the thirtieth minute and ten minutes from the thirtieth to the sixtieth minute. Endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation and corneal thickness were evaluated by non-contact specular microscopy before paracentesis (M0), 12 h after it (M1) and elapsed 1 h (M2), 12 h (M3) and 24 (M4) of intracameral injection. Results: No differences were found in PD between the TG and the NTG (p > 0.05). The parameters in specular microscopy, except corneal thickness did not differ between groups. In the TG, the mean value of corneal thickness in M3 (0.40 AE 0.03 mm) was different from M0 (0.36 AE 0.01 mm; p < 0.05). In the NTG average values of corneal thickness on M2 (0.42 AE 0.07 mm) and M3 (0.41 AE 0.05 mm) did not differ (p > 0.05), but did so in relation to M0 (0.36 AE 0.01 mm) and M4 (0.36 AE 0.03 mm) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: While the intracameral injection of 1% lidocaine did not modify PD and endothelial parameters, transient changes occurred in corneal thickness.

Methods: Forty eyes of 20 dogs with bilateral senile cataract were studied by dividing them into two groups: CG, control; and TG, treatment group. All patients were prepared for surgery according to established protocols. Immediately before initiating the interventions, the device was applied to TG patients in the vitreous, via pars plana. Postoperatively, therapeutic management varied between the groups. CG patients were administered local and systemic steroids, antibiotics and cycloplegic drops, as per the norm. In the TG, corticosteroid eye drops and systemic drugs were not administered. Patients were evaluated by biomicroscopy with slit lamp, ultrasound, applanation tonometry and laser flaremetry, before the procedure and at different times after the procedure. Differences were considered significant when p \u2264 0.05. Results: The occurrence of uveitis signs was higher in TG. On ultrasonography, there was a slight reduction of the device at 30 days, and remained the same at 60 days postoperatively. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher in the TG relative to the CG and the procedure immediately reduced to lower values in subsequent times. There was, in the group, the need for supplementary anti-inflammatory steroid therapy site in 35% of cases after the first week and by 50% after the third week postoperatively. These showed flare higher than the control group, for 60 days of evaluation. Conclusions: Dexamethasone slow-release devices are emerging as an option for controlling inflammation. However, in this study, they offered no additional benefits. The results obtained are preliminary and thus require further investigation.

Methods: Twenty four adult Wistar rats were stratified into four groups. Left eye corneas were cauterized by pressing a filter paper (3 mm) embedded with silver and potassium nitrate solution (3:1). Cauterization time was 10 s for group I and 20 s for group II. Following removal of the filter papers, the corneas were washed with Ringer lactate solution. Corneas of group III and group IV also were cauterized for 20 s and 10 s, but the filter papers were not removed before washing. Anterior segment photos were taken using a TRC-50DX retina camera (Topcon Medical Systems, Inc.), followed by 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13 and 15 days of cauterization. The percentage of corneal area covered by vessels was estimated after 15 days, using image analysis software (Image J \u00e2 , NIH). Results: Two days after cauterization, 33.3% of corneas in group I, 66.6% in group II, 83,3% in group III and 100% in group IV showed vascularization. In the following periods, we observed an increase of corneal area covered by vessels in group 1, 2 and 3 (no difference between them, p > 0.05). On the 15th day of assessment, the cumulative rates of corneal angiogenesis were 66.6% for group 1 and 100% for the other groups. Regarding the percentage of corneal area covered by vessel, the values were 17.73% for group 1, 39.14% for group 2, 42.75% for group 3 and 30.66% for group 4. There were differences between group 1 and group 3 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: All alkali burn protocols except group 1, induced angiogenesis in 100% of samples.

ABSTRACT NO.: 022 Florida keratopathy in a red-bellied woodpeckera case report A Lazerson,* RL Swinger,* RR Dubielzig, \u2020 LB Teixeira, \u2020 AL Gardner \u2021 and RM Schneider \u2021 *Animal Eye Guys, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA; \u2020 University of Wisconsin, School of Veterinary Medicine, Madison, WI, USA; \u2021 South Florida Wildlife Center, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA Purpose: To describe a case of Florida keratopathy in a red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) and compare the histologic findings with other cases submitted to the Comparative Ocular Pathology Laboratory of Wisconsin (COPLOW). Methods: A wild red-bellied woodpecker was brought to the South Florida Wildlife Center for an injured wing. On ophthalmic examination the left eye had multiple, <2 mm, round, focal areas of white, stromal, corneal opacification with a dense center and a less defined halo, consistent with Florida keratopathy. No other ocular abnormalities were noted. The animal was euthanized for reasons unrelated to the eye. The eyes were placed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely. The left globe was sectioned in a horizontal plane and both halves were submitted for histology. Five step sections were made, sampling 10 different areas of the cornea which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The right globe was processed similarly for comparison. 14 cases of Florida keratopathy were identified in the COPLOW collection, comprised of 8 dogs, 5 cats and 1 gray fox, and evaluated for comparison. Results: The corneal epithelium, stroma and endothelium from both eyes were normal on histological examination. No histologic pathology was found that could explain the characteristic corneal opacities. This finding was consistent with all archived COPLOW cases of Florida keratopathy. Conclusion: Florida keratopathy affects the red-bellied woodpecker and no explanatory histopathology was found. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 023 Retrospective evaluation of feline granulomatous conjunctivitis A Lazerson,* RR Dubielzig, \u2020 LB Teixeira \u2020 and RL Swinger* *Animal Eye Guys, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA; \u2020 University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, Madison, WI, USA Purpose: To characterize the clinical appearance and histological findings of feline granulomatous conjunctivitis. Methods: Cases of feline conjunctivitis with histiocytes as the primary cell type and without a lipogranulomatous component were identified from the Comparative Ocular Pathology Laboratory of Wisconsin records between 1993 and 2015. Patient signalment, history, treatment, and clinical outcome were obtained when possible. All samples were stained with H&E, acid fast, GMS fungal, and gram stains. Results: 10 cases (6 female, 3 male, 1 unspecified) were located from 9500 feline submissions. 3 cats were mixed breed and 7 were pure breed. Average age was 8.5 AE 5.2 years. Lesion location was bulbar conjunctiva (2), third eyelid (TEL) (6), or bulbar conjunctiva and TEL (2). Lesions were OD (5), OS (2) and OU (3). The disease presented clinically as a distinct, nonpigmented, raised, nodule (6), diffuse enlargement of the TEL (1) or unspecified conjunctivitis (3). Histologically, the samples consist of solid sheets of granulomatous infiltrate composed of bland epithelioid cells, often with distinct, vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional multinucleated giant cells. No infectious organisms were seen. 8 cases had concurrent lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. 1 case formed nodules with necrotic and suppurative cores, 1 case had neutrophils in the small blood vessels, and 1 case had rare eosinophils. Follow up was unavailable for most cases. Two cases had no recurrence at 8 months and 7 years post excision, respectively. Conclusions: Feline granulomatous conjunctivitis is a rare, idiopathic disorder. Further study is needed to determine cause and ideal therapy. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 024 Manual corneal thickness measurements of healthy caprine and camelid eyes using a portable spectraldomain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) device AJ LoPinto,* CG Pirie,* D Bedenice* and SL Ayres \u2020 *Department of Clinical Sciences, Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (TCSVM); \u2020 Department of Biomedical Sciences, TCSVM Purpose: To establish normal corneal thickness measurements using a portable SD-OCT device in healthy caprine and camelid eyes. Methods: Clinically healthy adult goats and alpacas without ocular disease were evaluated for this study. All animals were sedated and gentle manual restraint was used to ensure proper positioning. Corneal pachymetry was performed on eyes of each animal in triplicate by a single operator (CGP). A 6 mm corneal pachymetry protocol was utilized using the Optovue \u00e2 iVue SD-OCT (Optovue Inc. Freemont, CA). All corneal measurements were obtained manually by one investigator (AJL) using the integrated caliper function. The epithelial thickness (ET), stromal thickness (ST), Descemet's membrane thickness (DT), and total corneal thickness (TCT) were measured twice from each image. All recorded measurements were analyzed to determine intra-user reliability using a mixed effects model. Results: Eleven female goats with a mean (AEstandard deviation; SD) age of 6.4 AE 2.1 years were examined. Mean ET, ST, DT, and TCT (AESD) was 96.1 AE 5.0 lm, 486.0 AE 10.3 lm, 36.8 AE 4.8 lm, and 616.9 AE 7.1 lm, respectively. Eleven alpacas (4 male, 7 female) with a mean age (AESD) of 6.5 AE 3.6 years were examined. Mean ET, ST, DT, and TCT was 147.4 AE 5.7 lm, 446.1 AE 7.4 lm, 44.5 AE 5.0 lm, and 634.8 AE 6.2 lm, respectively. The intraclass correlations for all layers ranged from 0.26 to 0.75. Conclusion: The SD-OCT device provides manual corneal thickness measurements with clinically acceptable intra-operator reliability in healthy caprine and camelid eyes for ET, ST, and TCT measurements.

            "text": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of CO 2 pneumoperitoneum of 10 mmHg and 10\u00b0Trendelenburg positioning, on intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods: Eight adult Beagles were submitted to two surgical positioning regimens at different times. In group GSI, the animals were submitted to dorsal recumbence without head-down tilt; in group TREN, the same animals undergone a Trendelenburg positioning. General anesthesia was induced using propofol and maintained with isoflurane. IOP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), partial arterial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2 ), heart (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), in the moments: immediately before insufflation (TIS); 5 (T5DI); 30 (T30DI) and 60 (T60DI) minutes after insufflation. The data were submitted to one-way ANOVA for repeated measures, followed by Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons among time points, and t test for comparisons between groups. The significance level established was of 5%. Results: Comparing GSI x TREN in isolated moments, only the left eye showed an increase in IOP. There was a decrease in MAP after insuflation. CVP did not change over time and between groups. There was no difference regarding HR between groups. RR differed between GSI and TREN in different time points. The PaCO 2 , showed no difference between groups. Conclusions: The pneumoperitoneum of 10 mmHg and the 10\u00b0Trendelenburg position did not influence the PO and other cardiorespiratory variables in dogs anesthetized Purpose: To determine if the equine cornea is suitable as an ex vivo model. Specifically, to assess the equine cornea's extracellular matrix and cellularity after 7 days using two different culture techniques (either (a) an air/liquid interface or (b) immersion system) to determine the best ex vivo equine corneal model.

One sclero-corneal ring (SCR) from each horse is placed in the (a) air/liquid interface organ culture system (ALC), with the contralateral SCR being placed in the (b) immersion condition (IC) organ culture system for 7 days. All SCRs are evaluated using serial daily gross photography, histology, RT-PCR and TUNEL assay. Results: SCR's placed in b (IC) lost corneal transparency on gross photography, demonstrated severe corneal edema, total loss of corneal epithelium, endothelium and lamellar architecture on histologic evaluation, had marked apoptosis on TUNEL assay, and increased aSMA on RT-PCR. System a (ALC) maintained parameters similar to normal equine controls with only minimal corneal edema noted throughout the experiment. Conclusions: The ALC condition (a) maintains the equine cornea's cellular matrix and preserves corneal transparency, while the IC system (b) results in near complete degradation of normal equine corneal architecture after 7 days in culture. The equine cornea can be used as a viable ex-vivo model for future planned studies providing an appropriate culture system is used.

Methods: A four-year-old female Lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus) was presented with bilateral cataracts. Ophthalmic examination revealed the presence of bilateral cataracts with no other ocular pathology. Measurements of the anterior ocular components, including K readings and pupil diameter, were made with a noncontact ocular biometer (Lenstar LS 900: Haag-Streit AG, Konig, Switzerland), through a low-coherence interferometry technique. Biometric measurements required to calculate IOL power were obtained using B-scan ultrasound. The results were used to calculate intraocular lens power and size. Paraxial vergence equations provided the lens power that would make the retina optically consistent with a target refractive error of +0.50D in each eye. The lens was assumed to be thin and located at the posterior aspect of the pre-surgical lens thickness. A hydrophilic acrylic foldable lens was manufactured based on the above information. Cataract removal was routine with an Acrivet phacoemulsification system used to remove lens contents, and the artificial lenses injected into the capsular bags. Results: Dense capsular opacities were noted intraoperatively; these precluded retinoscopy postoperatively. The falcon's vision was improved and she was able to perch and prehend food using vision, whereas she relied completely on tactile sense prior to surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time cataract removal and intraocular lens implantation have been performed in a falcon. Conclusions: Intraocular lens implantation following cataract removal is feasible in falcons. P Lenses were manufactured by I-MED pharma.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT NO.: 028 Intraocular pressure in Asian elephants by rebound tonometry (TonoVet \u00e2 ) BC Martins,* RD Whitley,* P Villages* and R Isaza* *Department of Small and Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA Purpose: This study aims to estimate the intraocular pressure (IOP) in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Methods: Rebound tonometry (TonoVet \u00e2 ) was performed in both eyes of eight Asian elephants. The animals were housed at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation at Central Florida. All animals were used to human interaction and were manually restrained without the use of sedation or anesthesia. No topical anesthetic agent was used for the measurements. Results: The mean (AESD) IOP was 32.7 (AE0.55) mmHg and the median was 33 mmHg when all eyes (OD and OS) were included. There was no significant difference (P = 0.58) between the IOP values of the right (32.73 AE 2.6) and left (32.07 AE 1.5) eyes. Collecting the IOP measurements was somewhat challenging considering that the animals could blink and remove the tonometer probe from the instrument, and potentially lodge it on the lower conjunctival fornix. Conclusions: This is the first report of intraocular pressure values in Asian elephants. The IOP values in this species are among the highest known in mammals. There is some risk to the examiner when performing an ophthalmic examination on an alert Asian elephant, and only those familiar with tonometry and assisted by an experienced elephant handler should attempt it. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 029 Comparison of intraocular pressure measurements using rebound (TonoVet \u00e2 ) and applanation (Tono-Pen xl \u00e2 ) tonometry in clinically normal alpacas (Vicugna pacos) JE McDonald,* AM Knollinger,* DD Dees \u2020 and NE MacLaren* *Eye Care for Animals, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; \u2020 Eye Care for Animals, Austin, TX, USA Purpose: To evaluate the mean and ranges of intraocular pressure (IOP) estimates in eyes of healthy alpacas (Vicug\u00f1a pacos) using rebound (TonoVet \u00e2 ) in comparison to applanation (TonoPen-XL \u00e2 ) tonometry. Methods: Complete ophthalmologic examinations were performed on forty healthy alpacas (80 eyes). Schirmer tear testing (STT) and IOP measurements using both TonoVet \u00e2 and TonoPen-XL \u00e2 tonometers were obtained OU. Data were analyzed, using a doubly repeated-measures ANOVA design and Student's paired t-test, with p \u2264 0.05 considered significant. There was a significant difference (p = 0.002) in the IOP obtained between the tonometers, with the rebound tonometer having a 1.7 mmHg (0.69-2.71 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI)) increase in IOP compared to the applanation tonometer. No significant differences in IOP were found between OD and OS with either instrument, age, gender, or breed. Conclusions: IOP readings from the rebound tonometer were statistically higher than from the applanation tonometer, however not considered clinically significant. Further studies comparing TonoVet \u00e2 and TonoPen-XL \u00e2 with direct manometric measurements may be necessary to validate tonometry for routine clinical use in alpacas. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 030 Feline entropion: a retrospective study of 126 cats (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) AM Nicklin and A van der Woerdt The Animal Medical Center, New York, NY, USA Purpose: To describe the signalment, presenting complaints, clinical signs, and treatment recommendations in 126 cats with entropion. Methods: Data was collected from the medical record of 126 cats diagnosed with entropion. Breed, age, sex, presenting complaints, clinical signs, and therapy were recorded. Results: 126 cats were included in the study. The average age was 7.8 years with a range of 5 weeks to 18 years. Domestic Shorthairs were most common (76.2%) followed by Persian cats (6.4%). The remaining 17.4% of cats comprised 12 other breeds. The most common presenting complaints were ocular discharge, squinting, and corneal ulceration. Entropion was present bilaterally in 38% of cats and unilaterally in 62% of cats. The lower lid alone was affected in 94.4% of cats, the upper lid in 3.2% and both lids in 2.4% of cases. 50.7% of eyes had concurrent corneal disease (corneal ulceration, sequestrum, or perforation) at the time of diagnosis. Moderate to marked blepharospasm was present in 50% of cats. Surgical correction of entropion was recommended in all cases except for cats which were poor anesthetic candidates or if the entropion was suspected to be spastic in nature. If surgery was declined medical management with artificial tears and manual repositioning of the eyelids was recommended. Surgical correction was performed in 35.7% of cats examined. Conclusions: The mean age of cats with entropion is greater than that of dogs with entropion. Ocular surface disease is common in cats with entropion. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 031 Associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of SRBD1 gene with glaucoma in Shiba-inu dog: a meta-analysis in six Japanese Veterinary Hospitals Purpose: We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the association between glaucoma pathology in Shiba-Inu and the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of glaucoma candidate gene, SRBD1. Methods: 152 Shiba-Inu dogs were recruited from six veterinary hospitals in Japan. 97 Shiba-Inu dogs were diagnosed as glaucoma (IOP, more than 25 mmHg) by tonometry. After purification of genomic DNA by buccal swabbing from glaucoma and normal dogs, three SNPs (rs8655283, rs22018514, rs22018513) in SRBD1 gene, reported as a candidate gene allele for glaucoma in Shiba-Inu, were analyzed by cycleave polymerase chain reaction (c-PCR). Results: Our meta-analysis showed that the risk of glaucoma in Shiba-Inu carrying T allele of rs8655283 was 1.43 times higher compared to those C allele (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-2.41). Carrying G allele of rs22018514 was 1.69 times higher than C allele (OR = 1.69 (1.00-2.85)). The strongest association with glaucoma was found in G allele of rs22018513 having 2.09 times higher risk than A allele (OR = 2.09 (1.25-3.52), P = 0.00803). Conclusions: These results showed that three SNPs of SRBD1 play an important role in the pathology of glaucoma in Shiba-Inu dog. We anticipated that the SNP genotyping data from this study can be used as a genetic testing to determine for the first time with precision whether a dog has glaucoma and to predict whether a dog will develop glaucoma.

ABSTRACT NO.: 032 Heat shock protein 70 expression in the equine cornea CW Peterson, * EA Driskell, * DA Wilkie, \u2020 C Premanandan \u2020 and RE Hamor * * University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA; \u2020 The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA Purpose: Constitutive expression of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) has been demonstrated in normal canine corneal epithelium and has been suggested to facilitate wound resolution through organized migration, proliferation, and adhesion. To broaden the understanding of corneal Hsp70 in other companion animal species, expression of Hsp70 was evaluated in normal and pathologic equine corneas to establish expression patterns and to determine whether Hsp70 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in equine corneal wound healing. Methods: Fixed tissue from normal equine cornea (n = 11) and therapeutic keratectomies of sterile keratopathies (n = 9), were subject to routine immunohistochemistry for Hsp70. Results: Normal equine corneas exhibited strong constitutive expression of Hsp70 in the nuclei of basal and suprabasilar epithelial cells. Expression of Hsp70 in immune-mediated keratitis was weakly expressed in the cytoplasm of basal epithelial cells, while expression in indolent ulcers was weak and diffuse in the cytoplasm of all epithelial cells, though staining expression was variable between samples. Conclusions: These findings suggest expression of Hsp70 is induced in the normal equine cornea and may be altered in sterile keratopathies, possibly contributing to their prolonged clinical course. Additional work is needed to better characterize expression in sterile keratopathies, especially in the unaffected epithelial tissue. noted. An excisional biopsy was performed. Results: Histopathology revealed a T-cell rich, B-cell lymphoma (LSA) and clean margins. The client declined staging and further therapy at the initial visit. Approximately 7 years later, the horse began to exhibit intermittent mild to moderate diffuse swelling of the conjunctiva of the right eye. Six months after onset, the swelling worsened acutely and was accompanied by severe swelling of the left conjunctiva. The horse then returned to UFVH and was diagnosed with diffuse conjunctival T-cell LSA confirmed on immunohistochemistry and was humanely euthanized. At necropsy, neoplastic tissue was observed throughout the adnexal and ocular tissues of both eyes and in the submandibular lymph nodes. Conclusion: Ocular and adnexal LSA is an uncommon neoplasm in the horse. To the authors knowledge, this is the first documentation of a nodular adnexal LSA that involved a 7-year period without recurrence followed by development of diffuse disease. Typically, surgical excision of the nodular form of LSA involving the extraocular tissues yields an improved prognosis compared to the diffuse form of the disease. Purpose: To develop an ex vivo model of canine corneal epithelial wound healing that maintains corneal clarity, integrity and limbal stem cell function in extended culture. Methods: Corneoscleral (CS) rims were excised 4 mm posterior to the limbus and placed on a novel mutating scaffold in physiologic conditions. In Part A, 8 corneas were monitored for epithelial integrity and bacterial infection up to 28 days in culture. In Part B, 8 corneas were wounded, the epithelium removed and monitored for healing in the same culture conditions or a serum free protein equivalent media. Photographs were taken with standardized scale and cobalt filter every 6 h at the time of fluorescein stain and media change. Image J imaging software was used to determine area of positively staining defect. Healing rates of epithelial wounds were calculated and CS rims then fixed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM). Results: All corneas survived to endpoints as described in Part A with no infection or fluorescence indicative of compromise to the epithelium. Histologically, a multilayered epithelium was maintained and corneal edema was not appreciated until day 14. All corneas with epithelial wounds healed with a healing rate of 0 Purpose: To describe the clinical appearance and diagnosis of a basal cell carcinoma of the nictitating membrane in a dog. Methods: A 9-year-old female spayed Dachshund presented to the Bailey Small Animal Teaching Hospital, Auburn University following a 2-3 week history of ocular discharge in the right eye (OD). Ophthalmic examination revealed an irregular, pink, multilobulated mass arising from the bulbar and medial aspect of the right nictitating membrane. An incisional biopsy of mass was performed. Results: Histopathology from an incisional biopsy was consistent with a basal cell tumor. Computed tomography of the head identified a well-defined, soft tissue attenuating, contrast enhancing ovoid mass (arising from the nictitating membrane) in the cranioventral aspect of the right orbit; the mass did not invade the globe or orbit. The nictitating membrane was resected and cryotherapy was performed. Based on cellular morphology, the mass was diagnosed as a basal cell carcinoma. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report of a basal cell carcinoma in the nictitating membrane of a dog. Although uncommon, basal cell carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnoses of tumors of the nictitating membrane. None ABSTRACT NO.: 037 Sutureless Acell \u00e2 xenograft and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive for corneal perforation in a pregnant mare Ophthalmic examination revealed 4 corneal ulcers: three mid-stromal to deepstromal corneal ulcers and a descemetocele. Due to general anesthesia risk to the foal, owners elected medical therapy consisting of topical antibiotics, antifungals and mydriatics, and systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A Seidel test positive, 2 mm corneal perforation at the descemetocele site with a shallow anterior chamber was noted the following day. The periphery of the corneal perforation was debrided and a 2 mm Acell xenograft was positioned over the fibrin clot and sealed with CTA 360\u00b0around the graft. The Acell xenograft and CTA corneal integration were evaluated using a 50 MHz ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) 10 and 40 days post-grafting. Results: There was prompt and permanent restoration of the anterior chamber, with minimal inflammatory response to the xenograft. The CTA remained in place for 17 days. Forty days after presentation, UBM revealed loss of the CTA and incorporation of the Acell xenograft into the stroma. Four months after presentation the mare remained visual with mild corneal fibrosis and a clear anterior chamber. was performed in 8 diabetic dogs (4 females and 4 males), aphakic dogs (n = 7) and pseudophakic dogs (n = 1), of different breeds, 6-15 years old (mean = 10.3), and compared to 9 healthy control dogs (5 females and 4 males), 4-15 years old (mean = 6.9), without ocular disorders. The selection of animals was based on routine and ophthalmic examination. OCT measurement was performed in the temporal and nasal superior retina using a manual caliper. RT was defined by the distance between the retinal nerve fiber layer and retinal pigment epithelium. Unpaired t-test was used (p < 0.05). Results: At the time of OCT, the average time postcataract surgery was 11 months, and mean diabetes duration was 19 months. None showed changes in IOP and weren't being medicated at the time of examination. Purpose: Determine if ductular squamous metaplasia of the gland of the third eyelid in dogs is associated with particular signalment, clinical signs or histopathological lesions. Methods: The COPLOW database was mined for cases of canine ductular squamous metaplasia of the gland of the third eyelid. Cases were reviewed, described and summarized. Results: Twenty-two cases of squamous metaplasia of the gland of the third eyelid in dogs were found. Affected dogs were an average of 11.8 years old and there were 13 males and 9 females. Dachshunds were over represented (7 cases, 32%). The most common presenting clinical sign was swelling or mass of the third eyelid (21 cases, 95%). Histologically affected ducts were lined by multiple layers of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which occasionally occluded the lumens, with varying degrees of ectasia and intraductal secretory material, sloughed epithelial cells and inflammatory cells (dochitis). Of the 22 cases, 11 were associated with adenocarcinomas of the gland of the third eyelid, two were associated with squamous cell carcinoma presumed to arise from the ducts of the gland of the third eyelid and the other nine were associated with lymphoplasmacytic adenitis. Conclusions: Ductular squamous metaplasia of the gland of the third eyelid is associated with inflammation and neoplasia of the third eyelid and is frequently reported in dachshunds. Purpose: To report a case of unilateral exophthalmos and bilateral blindness due to a primitive neuroectodermal tumor in a horse. Methods: A donated 15-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented for progressive exophthalmos and blindness of the left eye (OS) of 7 months duration, as well as blindness of the right eye (OD) of two months duration. Physical examination, including ophthalmic and neurologic evaluation, electroretinography (ERG), and necropsy were performed. Results: Clinical findings included mydriasis and absent menace responses in both eyes (OU), as well as resistance to retropulsion and mild conjunctival hyperemia OS. Additionally, there was a unilaterally prominent facial vein on the left side. There were multifocal depigmented areas in the nontapetal fundus OD, and ERG results were normal OU. Necropsy revealed a large, well demarcated, red to brown mass extending from the cribriform plate to the nasal cavity and through the ventral calvarium and ventromedial wall of the left orbit. The optic chiasm and right orbit were grossly normal. Histologically, bilateral axonal degeneration and gliosis of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and optic tracts were identified. The tumor was diagnosed as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: A primitive neuroectodermal tumor resulted in a unilateral retrobulbar mass and bilateral optic nerve axonal degeneration. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first described case of a primitive neuroectodermal tumor causing exophthalmos and bilateral blindness due to involvement of the optic pathways in a horse.

The purpose of this study was to use this assay to evaluate the effects of commercially available eye drops, which have reported corneal reparative activity. Methods: The following three eye drops were examined: 0.1% sodium hyaluronate (SH) (TEARBALANCE \u00e2 and Hyalein \u00e2 ) and preservative-free 0.1% SH (Hyalein \u00e2 mini). The protocol of the primary epithelial cell toxicity assay was as follows: Circular corneal explants were trephined from the peripheral cornea of porcine eyes with 2-mm biopsy punches and placed on 6-well culture dishes. After incubation for 12 h, 50 lL of each eye drop was applied to each well for 2 min. After another 24 h, epithelial outgrowth was photographed and measured. Purpose: Evaluate the influence of the decline of estradiol levels consequent to ovaryohysterectomy (OHE) in tear production in canine females in estrogenic phases. Methods: 20 canine females in proestrus or estrus, identified by exfoliative vaginal cytology and by measurement of serum estradiol, were divided into two groups: Females who underwent OHE (G1) and females not subject to OHE (G2). In both groups, tear production was measured with Schirmer tear test (STT) at three moments. Day 0, 2 and 9: Before, two and nine days after the OHE in G1; and day 0, 2 and 9 after the onset of proestrus or estrus in G2. STT values were compared within each group and between-groups. STT values and serum estradiol were analyzed to evaluate their correlation. ANOVA and Pearson Correlation techniques were employed for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). Results: The average of STT on day 0 were 23.6 (G1) and 21.8 mm/min (G2); on day 2: 20,3 (G1) and 21.3 mm/min (G2) and on day 9 was 21.6 mm/min for both groups. STT values obtained in the two groups at different time points revealed no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05). The average serum estradiol was 88.8 pg/mL in the G1, while in the G2 was 59.68 pg/mL. STT and seric estradiol correlation was observed, but a negative type (correlation index <0). Conclusions: Estrogens had no influence on the tear production of canine females, therefore, OHE was not a surgical procedure that predisposed patients to the presentation of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Purpose: To evaluate levels of endogenous free cortisol in normal canine tears and serum at rest and after a simulated stress event. Methods: Paired tear and serum samples were collected from 11 normal, adult dogs once daily, at the same time of day for 3 consecutive days. Paired tear and serum samples were then collected from 4 normal, adult dogs once before and at 1 and 2 h post intravenous injection with ACTH. (Cortrosyn \u00e2 , 5 lg/kg IV) Tears were collected by placing a glass capillary tube at the medial conjunctival fornix. Tear and serum free cortisol concentrations were determined using a Salimetrics \u00e2 salivary cortisol ELISA validated for use in canine tears and an IMMULITE \u00e2 immunoassay respectively. Tear and serum cortisol concentrations were compared using one-tailed t-tests. Results: Cortisol was present in resting canine tears and serum at mean concentrations of 0.57 lg/dL and 3.13 lg/dL respectively. The concentration of cortisol in both tears and serum was significantly elevated one hour after ACTH stimulation (p-value <0.05) and was predictably reduced but remained significantly elevated two hours after ACTH stimulation (p-value <0.05 A 12 year old spayed female domestic shorthair cat with a history of sequestra 3 years prior was examined for a slowly enlarging pink mass on the left cornea. Examination, diagnostic testing, transpalpebral enucleation, and recheck visits were performed. Results: Cytology of the enlarging pink left corneal lesion at the time of presentation was nondiagnostic, while incisional biopsy was consistent with a high grade fibrosarcoma. Systemic evaluation did not reveal evidence of metastasis, and transpalpebral enucleation was elected by the owner. Ocular histopathology revealed a mass within the central corneal stroma composed of interweaving bundles of anaplastic spindle cells and separated by fibrillar collagen. The neoplastic cells had features supporting a high grade fibrosarcoma (anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, multiple nucleoli, mitotic rate of 30 per 10 high power fields). There were multiple foci of necrosis that contained aggregates of mineral within and adjacent to the mass as well as foci of osseous metaplasia. Conclusions: This is the first known report of a feline corneal fibrosarcoma. Development of the tumor may have been associated with the previously diagnosed corneal sequestrum, as remnants appeared still present on ocular histopathology. Based on complete surgical clearance via enucleation the potential for metastasis is expected to be low and long term prognosis to be at least fair. The patient will be followed, and metronomic therapy is being considered. (16), pug (11), Brittany (5), lhasa apso (4), Alaskan malamute (2), bearded collie (1), red bone hound (1) and saluki (1) were over-represented, and the Labrador retriever (3) was under-represented in comparison to the reference population (P < 0.001). Median (range) age of affected dogs was 8.9 (3-20) versus 6.8 (0.1-26) years for the reference population. Middle-aged dogs were over-represented and young dogs were under-represented in the SARD population (P < 0.001). Median (range) BW of affected dogs was 12.4 (2.9-52.7) versus 22.3 (0.1-60) kg for the reference population. Dogs between 10 and 20 kg were over-represented in the SARD population (P = 0.006). Spayed females (59% of affected dogs) were over-represented compared to the reference population whereas intact females (1% of affected dogs) were under-represented (P = 0.002). No significant difference in month or season of presentation was detected between the SARD and reference populations (P = 0.1 and 0.6, respectively). Purpose: To determine blink patterns and establish kinematic parameters of lid motion in normal horses. Methods: Ten adult mares were filmed for 10 min using high resolution videography. One camera was positioned perpendicular to the right eye and the other was positioned perpendicular to the long axis of the horse. Five minutes of video footage was analyzed for mean blink rate/min, number of complete vs. incomplete blinks, and number of unilateral vs. bilateral blinks. Video of one representative complete blink from each horse was further analyzed with image analysis software to determine the area of corneal coverage as a function of time during the blink. Results: The mean AE SD blink rate was 18.9 AE 5.5 blinks/min. Blinks were subcategorized as complete (31 AE 13%), complete squeeze (6 AE 2%), minimal incomplete (30 AE 15%), and moderate incomplete (33 AE 6%). Blinks were unilateral 23% (OD: 12 AE 9%; OS: 11 AE 4%) of the time and bilateral 77 AE 10% of the time. The mean area of exposed cornea at the initiation of each blink was 5.89 AE 1.02 cm 2 . Blink duration was 0.4667 AE 0.0712 s. Lid closure was approximately twice as rapid as lid opening (0.16 s vs. 0.31 s). Conclusions: The mean blink rate/min in the horse was similar to the blink rate reported in normal human subjects. Horses had relatively fewer complete blinks compared with normal human subjects (suggesting greater tear film stability) with closure being much more rapid than opening.

Capsules were monitored for changes in cell density and morphology; histology was performed at experimental completion. Corneal endothelial cells were treated with 0 and 0.3% TB for 120 s and an LDH viability assay performed. Results: TB did not significantly reduce LEC density. While TB-treated LECs demonstrate higher rates of cell death compared to vehicle control, the difference was not significant. Induction of apoptotic signaling was found in TB-treated LEC cultures. Ex vivo PCO formation was not significantly different in any treatment group. Endothelial cells treated with TB or vehicle showed no significant differences in cell death. Purpose: To assess the long term outcome of intravitreal gentamicin injection on glaucomatous canine eyes. Methods: Following vitreal aspiration, 25 mg of gentamicin was injected intravitreally into 26 blind canine eyes with primary (21) or secondary (5) glaucoma under general anaesthesia. The cause of glaucoma, complications and final outcome were assessed. Failure was defined as the need to enucleate the operated eye or euthanasia of the patient due to ocular pain; success was determined as a comfortable eye with no need of further treatment. Results: Median IOP before surgery was 44.5 mmHg (range 8-72 mmHg) and 10 mmHg (range 2-27 mmHg) within 6.5 days post surgery. Postoperatively all eyes showed varying degrees of corneal oedema and uveitis such as keratic precipitates, hyphaema, aqueous flare, posterior synechia and hyalitis. Failure occurred in 7/27 (26%) eyes due to incontrollable glaucoma, occurring within a median of 30 days (range 20-76 days) following surgery. No significant influence between prior and secondary glaucoma was evident. In 20/ 27 (74%) eyes, the surgery resulted in a blind but comfortable eye with no need of further medication with a median follow-up of 632 days (range 12-2847 days). Conclusions: Intravitreal gentamicin injection resulted in significant IOP reduction in all glaucomatous eyes post-surgery. However, all eyes showed varying degrees of uveitis following the procedure and failure leading to enucleation or euthanasia occurred in 26% of the patients.

            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate the protective role that MG53, an essential gene for cell membrane repair, plays in corneal wound healing. Methods: Western blots were used to determine MG53 expression in human corneal epithelial cells (hCEC), human tears, and canine aqueous humor. Membrane repair was evaluated using microelectrode penetration in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-MG53 expressing hCEC with subsequent observation of translocation. Additionally, hCEC underwent glass bead damage followed by treatment with recombinant human (rhMG53) and LDH analysis. The effect on corneal wound healing was evaluated in an in vivo alkaline-induced injury model in rats. Results: Human CEC, tears, and canine aqueous humor all expressed MG53, indicating a potential role of MG53 in protecting the cornea against injury. Indeed, live cell imaging revealed that microelectrode penetration could induce nucleation of GFP-MG53 to injury sites of hCEC. Additionally, application of rhMG53 significantly protected hCEC against mechanical injury induced by micro-glass beads. In vivo corneal injuries demonstrated that rhMG53 could improve re-epithelialization, indicating membrane damage repair mediated by MG53 plays an important role in corneal reparation. Conclusions: MG53 enhances hCEC injury-induced membrane repair and plays an important role in improving corneal wound healing outcomes. The presence of MG53 in both the tear film and aqueous humor indicates that therapeutic approaches involving exogenous MG53 are unlikely to invoke inflammatory responses in the eye.",

Purpose: To describe a novel globe sparing procedure for canine iridociliary masses via surgical debulking and adjunctive endoscopically guided transscleral cryotherapy with or without diode endolaser photocoagulation. Methods: Medical records of dogs receiving treatment for ciliary body tumors with surgical debulking of the mass in addition to adjunctive transscleral cryotherapy plus or minus endolaser at Long Island Veterinary Specialists from October 2012 to April 2015 were reviewed. Results: Three eyes from three dogs were eligible for inclusion. Preoperatively, incipient cataract (n = 2) and hypotony (6 mmHg; n = 1) were noted. Surgical debulking with adjunctive endoscopically guided cryotherapy (n = 3) and endolaser (n = 2) was performed. Histopathology confirmed an iridociliary epithelial tumor (n = 1), iridociliary adenoma (n = 1), and iridociliary tumor (n = 1). Longterm medical management consisted of topical anti-inflammatory medications. Postoperative complications included eyelid margin depigmentation (n = 2), superficial corneal ulceration (n = 1), corneal edema (n = 1), and anterior uveitis (n = 3). Permanent ocular changes included focal posterior synechiae (n = 3), focal anterior synechiae (n = 1), and corneal degeneration (n = 1). Mild, non-vision threatening cataract progression was noted 9 months postoperatively in one case. All eyes maintained vision with no evidence of tumor recurrence during the follow-up period (9-30 months).

Methods: Records from two practices over a 6-year period were reviewed to identify primary SCCED cases with notable corneal vascularization and follow up information. Cases were excluded if they had a keratectomy; debridement, anterior stromal puncture and/or diamond burring was permitted. Time to healing between non-corticosteroid and corticosteroid treatment groups was compared via two-tailed, non-paired student t test (significance P < 0.05). Frequency and type of complications were noted for both groups. Results: Fifty-six cases in 49 dogs were identified, and 40 of those cases were treated with a topical corticosteroid. Mean time to healing in the non-corticosteroid treatment group was 26.5 days versus 23.1 days in the corticosteroid treatment group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.48). Serious complications were rare. The non-corticosteroid treatment group had complications in 35.3% of cases; including infection and infiltrate with stromal loss, and exuberant granulation tissue formation warranting further treatment. In the corticosteroid treatment group, 7.7% of cases had a complication. Complications in this group did not include infection, infiltrate or stromal loss, and were isolated to persistent vascularization (n = 1) and short-term recurrence of ulceration (n = 2). Anecdotally, corticosteroid-treated dogs experienced less irritation after interventions such as debridement. Purpose: Evaluate the effects of 0.1% diclofenac and 0.03% flurbiprofen on corneal sensitivity in normal canine eyes after repeated dosing and 30 days of twice daily dosing. Methods: A prospective, randomized, masked, crossover study of 18 healthy, non-brachycephalic dogs was performed. For Phase I, the study drug was instilled every 5 min for five doses, and corneal sensitivity of the control and treated eye was evaluated prior to drug instillation and every 15 min post-instillation for 60 min. For Phase II, the study drug was instilled every 12 h for 30 days, and corneal sensitivity for the control and treated eye was evaluated prior to drug instillation on days 0 and 30. A washout period of at least 30 days occurred between drug crossover and between phases. Temperature and humidity were measured throughout data collection. Results: Average age and weight were 5.7 AE 3.3 years and 25.1 AE 6.8 kg, respectively. There were no significant differences in corneal sensitivity after multiple instillations of diclofenac (P = 0.67) or flurbiprofen (P = 0.54). Corneal sensitivity was also not significantly different after 30 days of twice daily use with either diclofenac (P = 0.82) or flurbiprofen (P = 0.56). Decreasing humidity was associated with an increase in corneal sensitivity measurements (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Neither diclofenac nor flurbiprofen have an effect on corneal sensitivity in normal canine eyes after repeated dosing or 30 days of twice daily dosing. Ambient humidity may have an effect on corneal sensitivity measurements with a longer filament length eliciting a blink response at a lower humidity.",

            "text": "Purpose: Describe the technique and utility of 3D printing for orbital and peri-orbital masses. Methods: Computed tomography (CT) and subsequent 3D printing of the head was performed on two dogs. Case one was an 11-year old spayed female Dachshund with a 3 week history of non-painful exophthalmos of the right eye (OD). Case two was a 13.5-year old castrated male English Springer Spaniel with a 5 week history of non-painful exophthalmos OD. A biopsy of the mass observed with CT was obtained in both cases. A lateral orbitotomy was tentatively planned for each case, and a 3D print of each head with the associated globe and mass was created to assist in surgical planning. Results: Both CT scans confirmed a confined mass. In case one, the mass was located in the cranioventral aspect of the right orbit, and the histopathologic diagnosis was adenoma. Due to suspicions of a nictitans gland adenoma based on location, the nictitans and associated tumor were removed with complete excision. In case two, the mass was located within the lateral masseter muscle ventral to the right orbit, between the zygomatic arch and ramus of the mandible. The histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with a lipoma, and due to the animal's age and benign nature of the tumor, continued monitoring was elected. Conclusions: 3D printing in cases with orbital and peri-orbital masses has exceptional potential for improved surgical planning. Additionally, 3D printing provides another modality for visualization to help veterinarians, students, and clients understand distribution of disease. Purpose: To discuss the diagnosis and treatment of an orbital lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma in a cat. Methods A 14.5-year old castrated male domestic shorthair cat was evaluated for a 2 week history of a swollen left upper eyelid that was unresponsive to systemic antibiotic therapy. Upon examination, a dorsal orbital mass was identified and noted to move independent of the left globe (OS). Mild ventral strabismus was present, but no other abnormalities were noted OS. The mass was surgically excised and submitted for histopathology. Adjunctive cryotherapy was performed at the surgical wound. Post-operative treatment consisted of neo/poly/bac three times daily OS for 1 week and 6 mg of robenacoxib by mouth once daily for 2 days. Results: Histopathology of the excised mass confirmed an adenocarcinoma, and special staining using mucicarmine and periodic acid Schiff confirmed a serous gland origin. Prior to surgery, no metastases were noted via thoracic radiographs, and a full body CT scan performed 5 weeks post-surgery did not reveal any metastatic disease. At a follow-up evaluation 5 weeks post-surgery, the surgical wound was healed with no evidence of tumor regrowth. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a feline orbital lacrimal gland adenocarcinoma, and it should be included as a differential diagnosis for masses located in the feline dorsal orbit. Surgical excision with adjunctive cryotherapy may be an effective treatment strategy if confined to the anterior aspect of the orbit. None.",

Methods: Images obtained using the D-EYE (Si14 S.p.A., Padova, Italy) were compared to those taken using more traditional equipment (Smartscope and digitally converted Kowa RC-2 fundus camera). The pupils of dogs, cats, and horses were dilated using tropicamide and their fundi were then photographed. All images were taken in a dark environment. Ease of use, field of view, focus, exposure, and white balance were subjectively compared. Video sequences were also recorded and evaluated. Results: The D-EYE/smartphone combination was considered light, compact, convenient, and easy to use on conscious and unsedated animals. With regard to handling, the D-EYE was similar to traditional direct ophthalmoscopy. The viewing angle was approximately 20\u00b0. The focus and white balance were considered acceptable on all the devices tested. The tapetum lucidum was sometimes partially overexposed with both the D-EYE and the Smartscope, probably because of the small size of the sensors and their relatively poor ability to manage the wide variations of animals' fundi. This hyper-reflective artifact must not be mistaken for pathological tapetal hyper-reflectivity secondary to retinal atrophy. Video sequences were considered efficient in the evaluation of fundi in all animals examined. Purpose: To evaluate effects of adjunctive treatment with platelet rich plasma (PRP) on corneal re-epithelialization, vascularization, and fibrosis in dogs with indolent corneal ulcers. Methods: Client-owned dogs with uncomplicated indolent ulcers were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. All dogs were treated with diamond burr epithelial debridement, topical tobramycin solution QID, topical atropine sulfate ointment SID, and Elizabethan collar placement for 4 weeks. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive autologous PRP solution QID (treatment group) or artificial tear solution QID (control group). Recheck examinations were performed at 2 and 4 weeks after initiating treatment. Results: To date, 37 dogs have completed the study including 18 dogs that received PRP and 19 dogs that received artificial tears. Eleven of 18 control dogs (61%) and 12 of 19 treatment dogs (63%) were healed by 2-week recheck (P = 0.90). Fifteen of 18 control dogs (83%) and 17 of 19 treatment dogs (89%) were healed by 4-week recheck (P = 0.59). Mean difference in corneal vascularization scores between the initial and 4-week recheck was 0.11 in the control group and \u00c00.11 in the treatment group (P = 0.55). Mean difference in corneal fibrosis scores between the initial and 4-week recheck was 0.61 in the control group and 0.42 in the treatment group (P = 0.54). Conclusions: In this preliminary study of indolent corneal ulcers, PRP did not improve outcomes, but was well-tolerated and may have other applications in canine ophthalmology.

Methods: Medical records of cats with iridal melanosis or melanoma from 2003 to 2013 were reviewed. Inclusion required clinical diagnosis of feline melanosis or histologic diagnosis of feline melanoma. Results: Thirty-two cats (34 globes) were included. Melanoma was diagnosed histologically in seven of nine enucleated globes. The mean age for melanosis and melanoma cats was 7.2 (range 2-14) and 9.1 (range 3-18) years, respectively. Dyscoria occurred in 7/7 melanoma and 3/25 (12%) melanosis globes. An abnormal PLR occurred in 7/7 melanoma and 5/25 (20%) melanosis cases. A nodular component of a lesion did not appear to correlate with a diagnosis of melanoma versus melanosis. Fifteen of 32 cats with pigmented iridal lesions died within 4 years after diagnosis. Four melanoma cats died a mean of 359 days (AE302) after surgery. Eleven melanosis cats died 1350 days (AE1045) after diagnosis. Histologic appearance of melanoma included heavy pigmentation (>75% coverage of the neoplastic area; n = 5) or light pigmentation (<25% coverage; n = 2), moderate cellular differentiation (n = 5) without a predisposition toward a certain cell morphology, and intermediate mitotic index ( Purpose: To develop an ex vivo model of canine corneal fibrosis that maintains normal canine corneal anatomy. Methods: Canine corneas, harvested from dogs euthanized for reasons unrelated to corneal pathology, were cultured ex vivo at the air-liquid interface in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultured corneas were wounded with 1 N NaOH and exposed to 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor beta (TGFb1) to promote the transdifferentiation of corneal fibroblasts to corneal myofibroblasts, producing an ex vivo model of corneal fibrosis. The efficacy of TGFb1 application to induce corneal fibrosis in na\u20ac \u0131ve and wounded corneas cultured ex vivo was evaluated longitudinally through apoptosis assays, photography, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantification of biochemical markers of fibrosis with immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Results: Treatment of corneas cultured ex vivo at the air-liquid interface with TGFb1 significantly increased aSMA expression in NaOH-wounded corneas (P < 0.01). Corneal anatomy was not adversely affected by ex vivo culture conditions or the presence of TGFb1. Conclusions: Canine corneas cultured ex vivo at the air-liquid interface are susceptible to TGFb1-induced fibrotic change. TGFb1 application induces myofibroblast transdifferentiation in wounded canine corneas to yield an ex vivo model of canine corneal fibrosis free of significant artifactual change. Cultured canine corneas can be maintained ex vivo at the air-liquid interface following NaOH-wounding for at least 2 weeks. Supported in part by a University of Missouri Purpose: To use a thermosensitive hydrogel (thermogel) polymer to achieve sustained intracapsular release of cyclosporine A (CsA) for reduction of ex vivo posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Methods: A PLGA-PEG-PLGA thermogel polymer was formulated to release CsA (300 lg/ml) or vehicle (ethanol). Extracapsular cataract extraction and IOL placement were performed in 24 canine cadaver globes. Lens capsule explants with residual lens epithelial cells (LEC) were treated with 200 ll of CsA-eluting (n = 12) or vehicle-eluting (n = 12) thermogel and maintained in culture. Posterior capsule coverage by LEC was graded following 7 (n = 8), 14 (n = 6), or 28 (n = 10) days of treatment. LEC were manually quantified via light microscopy from capsules in the 28-day treatment group. CsA concentration in culture media was quantified by LC-MS at each time point. Differences in percent posterior capsule coverage and LEC counts were analyzed by student's t-test with Welch's correction. Results: Posterior capsule coverage by LEC was significantly reduced in CsAthermogel treated capsules compared to vehicle-treated capsules. Percent posterior capsule coverage (mean AE SEM) for CsA-treated vs. vehicle-treated capsules was 0 vs. 33% AE 5.47 at day 7 (P < 0.05), 13.3% AE 4.41 vs. 85% AE 3.87 at day 14 (P < 0.0001), and 30% AE 6.35 vs. 96% AE 2.45 at day 28 (P < 0.0001). Histologic LEC counts were significantly lower in CsA-thermogel treated capsules (88.38 AE 28.65 cells) compared to vehicle-thermogel treated capsules (207.6 AE 33.38 cells; P < 0.05). Cumulative CsA release from the thermogel was >10 lg/ml over a minimum of 7 days. Conclusions: Use of a CsA-eluting thermogel polymer may be a viable pharmacologic method for reducing PCO. Higher eluted CsA concentrations will likely be necessary to prevent PCO formation entirely. Supported by American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. None.",

Methods: Forty-four healthy dogs (87 eyes) not currently on any topical or systemic medications were included. An ophthalmic examination including Schirmer Tear Test (STT) I, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), and slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment was performed and considered normal in all patients. Tear osmolarity was assessed using the I-Pen \u00e2 Osmolarity System over six serial measurements per eye. Fluorescein stain was negative for uptake in all patients following the I-Pen evaluation. SAS V9 software was used for obtaining estimates of the reference interval for healthy dogs. Results: Mean tear osmolarity was 317.5 AE 21.6 mOsms/l. The estimated reference limits were (274.3, 360.7). Serial measurements with I-Pen \u00e2 were highly correlated within the same eye and between eyes of the same animal. Due to the high correlation between measurements on the same eye, a single measurement was considered sufficient. STTI was not correlated with tear osmolarity. Conclusions: This study established a reference interval for tear osmolarity of healthy dogs using the I-Pen \u00e2 Osmolarity System. Further studies are indicated for the role of the I-Pen \u00e2 in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with tear film disorders. None.",

Methods: Seven 9-12 month Beagle dogs were used to establish corneal opacity. Baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed. An axial corneal alkali burn was obtained using 1 N NaOH. Six dogs were randomly and equally assigned into two groups: (A) vehicle (DMSO, 2 ll/ml); (B) anti-fibrotic treatment (50 lM SAHA). Degree of corneal opacity, ocular health and efficacy of SAHA were determined utilizing the Fantes grading scale, modified McDonald-Shadduck (mMS) scoring system, optical coherence tomography (OCT), histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: There was no significant difference in mMS scores between treatment groups (P = 0.89). Alpha-smooth muscle actin staining was significantly greater in all burned corneas than negative controls (P = 0.018). Total corneal thickness of all dogs post burn was significantly greater than baseline, irrespective of treatment (P = 0.004); TEM showed that the minimum and maximum distances between collagen fibrils were significantly greater in the burned corneas than the negative controls, regardless of treatment (P = 0.026, P = 0.018, respectively). Conclusions: The canine corneal alkali burn was well tolerated, performed without damaging the limbus, and generated significant fibrosis as evidenced by histopathology, TEM and OCT findings. Purpose: To determine if there was an association between NSAID use and delayed healing time or other complications in the treatment of superficial non-healing corneal ulcers in dogs. Methods: Records of 106 (113 eyes) dogs treated for superficial non-healing corneal ulcers with or without NSAID between 2009 and 2015 were reviewed. Successful outcome was defined as a healed, comfortable eye with vision at the last examination. Age, breed, sex, lesion characteristics, underlying corneal disease, topical therapies, debridement treatments, time to healing and complications were investigated for statistical associations. Results: Groups consisted of dogs that were treated (n = 70) or not treated (n = 36) with either Diclofenac (Akorn Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) or Flurbiprofen (Bausch & Lomb Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). There was no association between breed, sex, lesion location, or comorbidities and time to healing or complications. Comorbidities included KCS, endothelial degeneration, pseudophakia, Cushing's disease and diabetes mellitus. Increased age was associated with longer healing time (P \u2264 0.0208). NSAID use was associated with delayed time to healing, however, this effect disappeared once age was factored out. There was no difference in complications between groups, which included infection, keratomalacia, and enucleation. Dogs treated with a larger number of medications had a longer time to healing and increased complication risk (P \u2264 0.005). Conclusions: The use of topical NSAID for the treatment of superficial non-healing corneal ulcers was not found to prolong, nor expedite, healing time or increase the risk for complications. None.",

Lesions are bilaterally symmetric in location but asymmetric in onset. Males appear to be overrepresented amongst affected Friesians. Purpose: (1) To investigate mode of inheritance and (2) to identify a causative DNA variant of BCSL in Friesian horses for marker assisted selection and earlier diagnosis of at risk horses. Method: (1) Pedigree analysis of nine Friesian horses affected with BCSL and (2) sequencing of a candidate gene in one affected and four apparently unaffected Friesian horses used as controls to identify mutations that may be causative of BCSL. Results: All Friesian horses affected with BCSL trace back to a single prominent sire and pedigree analysis supports an X-linked mode of inheritance. A functional candidate gene located on the equine X chromosome (ECA X) was identified. Sanger sequencing of the candidate gene was performed to identify DNA variants in the affected horse compared to controls. Sample collection of additional affected horses is underway and these will be used to test any polymorphisms detected for association with disease. Conclusions: BCSL in Friesian horses is consistent with an Xlinked inheritance. A DNA variant in a biologically plausible gene on ECA X may be responsible for the increased risk of BCSL in Friesian horses. None.",

Methods: Clinically healthy adult goats and alpacas without ocular disease were enrolled. All animals were sedated and manual restraint was used to ensure proper positioning. Intravenous catheters were aseptically placed in the jugular vein prior to administration of 0.25% ICG (25 mg; Akorn Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA). Imaging was performed using an adaptor system consisting of a modified dSLR camera (Canon 7D), dSLR camera adaptor, and camera lens (Canon 60 mmf/2.8). Imaging occurred at a rate of 3/s immediately following ICG for 60 s, then at 2, 3, 4, and 5 min post-bolus. Ten minutes later, 10% SF (1000 mg; Akorn Inc.) was administered. Images were collected using the previously described adaptor system and imaging sequence. Results: Ten female goats with a mean (AESD) age of 6.8 AE 1.7 years and 10 alpacas (3 male, 7 female) with a mean age of 6.8 AE 3.8 years were examined. ICG angiography provided visualization of the arterial, capillary, and venous phases in both species. Visualization of the vascular pattern using SF was masked in alpacas, but not goats, due to iridal pigmentation. Extravasation of SF was a common finding in alpacas, but not in goats. No adverse events were noted. Conclusions: Diagnostic quality anterior segment ICG angiographic images were obtainable using the dSLR camera. Compared to SF, ICG offers superior visualization of the iris vasculature, particularly in the heavily pigmented alpaca eye. ABSTRACT NO.: 081 Determination of a no observable effect level (NOEL) for endotoxin following a single intravitreal administration to male dutch belted rabbits 0.5 endotoxin units/eye (EU/eye; USP standard). An initial range-finding study established a concentration range (0.05-0.5 EU/eye) for a larger definitive study with four treated groups (n = 5 eyes per group). Animals were monitored for up to 1 week post dose via slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy using the modified standardization of uveitis nomenclature (SUN) Working Group Grading Scheme to score aqueous cell and flare. Laser flare photometry was performed to quantitatively measure aqueous flare concurrent with most ophthalmic examinations. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical findings, possible contributing factors, visual outcome, and effectiveness of the use of a nictitating membrane (NM) flap as therapy in 18 cats (20 eyes) affected with feline acute bullous keratopathy (FABK). Methods: Medical records from 18 cats diagnosed with FABK and treated with a NM flap were retrospectively evaluated. Information collected included signalment, medical history, therapy, and ocular outcome. Results: Patient breeds included 12 DSH, 2 exotic shorthairs, 2 Maine Coon, 1 Persian, and 1 DMH. Two cats were bilaterally affected. Median age of cats was 3.2 years (range 0.26-15 years). Ten patients were spayed females, six neutered males, and two intact males. Topical steroids and topical NSAIDS were previously administered in five (25%) and three (15%) eyes, respectively; oral steroids were previously administered in six cats (33% of patients). Thirteen of 20 (65%) eyes had a history of ocular disease including anterior uveitis, sequestrum, ulcerative and non-ulcerative corneal disease, conjunctivitis, and glaucoma. Median duration of NM flap was 15 days (range 6-30 days). Follow-up ranged from 12 to 1601 days (median 113 days). A corneal perforation occurred in 1 (0.05%) eye, and was successfully repaired. Enucleation due to glaucoma (unrelated to bulla) was performed in another eye. Eighteen of the treated eyes resolved with no complications. Globe and vision were retained in 19 (95%) eyes. The PPRDR for the Bichon Frise was 14% in 265 eyes, affecting 18% of 168 dogs (95% CI 12-25%). This difference was accounted for in six dogs that had bilateral detachments. Diabetes mellitus was found as a negative risk factor (P = 0.0009), and the development of post-operative glaucoma was significantly associated with retinal detachments (P = 0.0021). No other risk factors were determined. Retinal detachments occurred at an average of 410 days post-operatively. Comparatively, PPRDR in the Boston Terrier was 11% in 19 eyes (18% of 11 dogs), and in the Shih Tzu was 11% in 36 eyes (17% of 23 dogs). Conclusions: The PPRDR in this population of Bichons (18%) was not statistically different from the rate seen in Boston Terriers and Shih Tzu. The rate varied widely among five surgeons but was not statistically significant. Funding: None.",

            "text": "Purpose: Myofibroblast differentiation at wound sites is tissue stress and composition dependent and the presence of fibronectin is required. The objective of this study was to probe how myofibroblast differentiation might be regulated. Methods: Several keratocyte phenotypes (IGF, PDGF, FGF, serum and TGF-b1-stimulated) were evaluated regarding myofibroblast differentiation, dedifferentiation potential, force generation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production and conformation modulation. Techniques employed included fluorescence microscopy, cell-substrate force measurement and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assays. Wild-type and fibronectin-knockout fibroblasts were used to investigate the influence of the presence and molecular conformation of fibronectin on the myofibroblast differentiation potential of TGF-b1-stimulated keratocytes. Results: Growth factor stimulation upregulated cell-generated traction forces and activated fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Myofibroblast differentiation required TGF-b1-stimulation and the presence of fibrillar fibronectin in the ECM. The strain of assembled ECM fibronectin fibrils positively correlated with cell-generated traction force. Growth factor, but not serum-stimulated cellular changes were reversible after growth factor deprivation. However, tension in the provisional fibronectin matrix assembled by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts was preserved even after decellularization. Myofibroblast-derived fibronectin matrices downregulated myofibroblast differentiation of TGF-b1-stimulated keratocytes compared to fibroblast-derived matrices. Conclusions: Activated (myo)fibroblasts utilize their own contractile forces to organize and stretch their ECM fibronectin, thus manipulating its signaling properties. Since cellular changes are largely reversible, newly assembled ECM may mechanically downregulate myofibroblast differentiation, help restore tensional homeostasis at wound sites and decrease scar tissue formation.

Methods: This case series describes surgical correction of eyelid agenesis in nine eyes of five cats using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate topical adhesive for wound closure after a modified Roberts-Bistner procedure. All cats were affected bilaterally; one cat required unilateral enucleation. Closure for the first three eyes involved multiple sutures, conjunctival lining, and topical adhesive. The technique was streamlined and closure in the subsequent six eyes involved topical adhesive with placement of a single, absorbable suture at the junction between the myocutaneous graft and the colobomatous defect to promote apposition and aid in application of cyanoacrylate. Results: All cats were domestic shorthairs (n = 5) and females were over-represented (n = 4). All eyes had a functional palpebral reflex, resolution of brown serous ocular discharge, and clinical improvement of keratitis post-operatively. Complications included periocular debris clinging to adhesive (7/9) and epiphora (2/9) believed to be secondary to trichiasis from the transposed graft. Periocular debris resolved from sloughing or cleansing at the final 6 week surgical recheck in all cats. Epiphora occurred only in eyes corrected with initial technique and resolved with cryoepilation. Conclusions: Use of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate in the surgical correction of feline eyelid agenesis is an effective, well-tolerated modification to the traditional Roberts-Bistner procedure. Benefits include abbreviated anesthetic time and reduced cost compared to traditional options, as well as, superior functionality and improvement of keratitis compared to cryotherapy alone or other non-blepharoplastic approaches. The cat was presented to the ophthalmologist with a history of FeLV and Bartonella seropositivity. Historical and preenucleation ophthalmic findings were consistent with chronic uveitis, including keratic precipitates, iris thickening, incipient cataract, and peripheral retinal irregularities. Treatment with topical dexamethasone and oral doxycycline had been discontinued. Hypertension up to 62 mmHg developed OS, followed by enucleation. Histologically, there was severe lymphoplasmacytic endophthalmitis, keratic precipitates, cataract, and glaucomatous retinal and optic nerve degeneration. In the equatorial lens were innumerable, 1-3 lm, round to oval structures that were gram-positive, Luna's-positive, and variably acid fast. E. cuniculi was confirmed with PCR from paraffin scrolls of the eye and serology (>1:4096). Conclusions: Encephalitozoonosis should be considered a differential in cats with cataract and uveitis. Clinical presentation was similar to other etiologies of feline uveitis. The role of FeLV and potential Bartonella co-infection in this cat are unknown. In rabbits, lenticular encephalitozoonosis is indicative of intrauterine infection (pathogenesis), which may be supported by the cat's young age. Luna's stain is a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of microsporidian parasites like E. cuniculi.",

Methods: Each pony was anesthetized twice to fulfill the criteria of the crossover study; each eye was used once. The initial NSAID given was randomly chosen. Thirty minutes after intravenous NSAID administration the baseline aqueocentesis was performed; 30 min later the second aqueocentesis was performed. Aqueous samples were analyzed for prostaglandin (PGE2) levels. Blinded observers performed subjective scoring for 3 days following aqueocentesis. One observer (NS) examined each pony twice daily until fibrin resolution. Results: There was a significant increase in PGE2 when comparing the first aqueocentesis to the second (P = 0.011). There was a trend towards the flunixin meglumine group having increased PGE2 concentrations at the second aqueocentesis when compared to the phenylbutazone group (P = 0.094). Time to fibrin resolution was significantly increased for those ponies that received flunixin meglumine versus those that received phenylbutazone: 10 and 4.75 days, respectively (P = 0.0256).

The purpose of this study was to fully characterize CED in GSHPs and GWHPs with noninvasive advanced ocular imaging techniques. Methods: Corneas of 10 affected (4 GSHP, 6 GWHP) and 19 unaffected (15 GSHP, 4 GWHP) dogs were examined using ultrasonic pachymetry (USP), Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). A two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to statistically compare parameters between the two groups. Data are presented as median (range). Results: Age of affected and unaffected dogs did not significantly differ at 11.4 (6.9-13.4) and 10.5 (6.9-14.4) years, respectively (P = 0.4). Central corneal thickness using USP was significantly greater in affected versus unaffected dogs at 1160 (926-1958) and 642 (497-737) lm, respectively (P < 0.001). Increased stromal thickness was validated using FD-OCT with measured values for affected versus unaffected dogs being 1006 (699-1395) and 537 (442-591) lm, respectively (P = 0.04). Corneal endothelial density using IVCM was significantly less (P < 0.001) in 3 dogs with CED at 319 (258-351) cells/mm 2 in comparison to 19 controls at 1769 (1358-2529) cells/mm 2 . Conclusion: GSHPs and GWHPs with CED exhibit marked differences in corneal morphology in comparison to age-matched control dogs. These data better inform the diagnosis and management of CED in these breeds.

KJ Spahn,* LS Wagner,* DD Dees \u2020 and CM Reilly \u2021 *South Texas Veterinary Ophthalmology; \u2020 Eye Care for Animals -Austin; \u2021 Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California -Davis Purpose: To describe the clinicopathologic features of three Great Dane littermates with presumed inherited bilateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous and persistent hyperplastic tunica vasculosa lentis (PHPV/PHTVL). Methods: Three Great Dane littermates presented for evaluation of cloudy eyes and decreased vision. Complete ophthalmic examination was performed by a board-certified ophthalmologist before and after mydriasis. Ultrasonography was performed in all patients using topical anesthesia without sedation. Enucleated globes from two dogs were examined microscopically with HE and Alcian Blue/ PAS methods. Results: All three patients were blind with negative menace responses, nonresponsive mydriatic pupils, and wandering nystagmus. All had mild-moderate blepharospasm, conjunctival hyperemia, episcleral congestion, diffuse corneal edema, corneal fibrosis and pigmentation, and moderate buphthalmia OU. Ultrasound showed complete bullous retinal separation with subretinal fluid. A hyperechoic linear band was present from the optic nerve to the posterior pole of the lens OU. Histologically, all globes had complete, displaced retinal separation, severe intraocular hemorrhage, and cataract. All had varying degrees of organizing hemorrhage, fibrovascular tissue, and wispy to dense matrix adjacent to the posterior lens. The matrix was intensely Alcian blue-positive, with regions of variable PAS-positivity; there was variable investment by small vascular profiles. Secondary lesions included neovascular glaucoma, chronic uveitis, and keratitis with stromal fibrosis and pigmentation. Conclusions: This the first report of PHPV/PHTVL in the Great Dane, supported by histopathology, and with evidence for a genetic basis in this litter. PHPV/ PHTVL should be a differential for young Great Danes with blindness, cataracts, intraocular hemorrhage, retinal separation, or glaucoma.

Methods: A 7-year-old spayed female Labrador Retriever presented to a private specialty referral hospital for evaluation of ptosis OD. Results: On full ophthalmic examination, a large, intrapalpebral, poorly-demarcated mass was present affecting the entire right dorsal eyelid causing moderate ptosis and extending just ventral to the dorsal orbital rim. The mass was non-painful and not adherent to the dorsal orbital rim. The right globe position and motility were normal. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed popliteal lymphadenomegaly bilaterally with mild diffuse pitting edema of the left rear leg distal to the stifle. Ultrasonography of the right eyelid revealed a homogenous, anechoic, poorly demarcated mass affecting the entire dorsal eyelid with no orbital involvement. Systemic bloodwork, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. A biopsy of the eyelid mass revealed severe pyogranulomatous conjunctivitis with intralesional fungal organisms. Fine needle aspirate of the left popliteal lymph node revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation. Urine Blastomyces dermatidis antigen test was positive. Oral therapy with fluconazole resulted in complete resolution of the eyelid mass and lymphadenomegaly. The patient was placed on long term fluconazole therapy with duration based on periodic urine antigen testing. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of canine systemic blastomycosis presenting as an eyelid mass. The eyelid mass resolved with systemic antifungal therapy and has not recurred 2 months after institution of fluconazole therapy. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 080 Canine ocular onchocerciasisa retrospective review of 16 cases in New Mexico NJ McLean,* KM Newkirk \u2020 and CM Adema \u2021 *VCA Veterinary Care Animal Hospital and Referral Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA; \u2020 Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee; \u2021 CETI, Department of Biology, University of New Mexico Purpose: To describe the clinical exam findings, treatment, and outcomes of 16 dogs diagnosed with ocular onchocerciasis in New Mexico. Methods: Records of dogs diagnosed by the primary author were reviewed ([2011][2012][2013][2014][2015]. Records that were accessible and included a diagnosis of Onchocerca lupi by histopathologic or molecular identification of the nematode were included. Results: Sixteen cases were included. Three of 16 dogs were treated with year-round heartworm prophylaxis prior to infection. Clinical exam findings included conjunctival hyperemia and/or episcleral injection (16/16), focal subconjunctival mass(es) (13/16), corneal vessels (7/16), retinal detachment (7/16), corneal edema (4/16), chemosis (3/16), corneal opacity (2/16), exophthalmia (1/16), glaucoma (1/16), strabismus (1/16), blepharospasm (1/16), and vitreal degeneration (1/16). Ocular involvement was unilateral in 8/16 dogs and bilateral in 8/16 dogs. The diagnosis was based on histopathologic identification of the nematode (7/ 16), histopathologic identification and sequencing of PCR amplicons from nematode COI and/or ND5 genes (4/16), or PCR detection alone (5/16). Skin snips tested positive by PCR in 3/3 dogs. Nematodes were grossly visible in all dogs in which surgery was performed. Treatment consisted of excision of granuloma(s) (5/16), enucleation (1/6), intramuscular administration of melarsomine (12/16), oral doxycycline or minocycline (15/16), subcutaneous ivermectin (12/16), oral prednisone (14/16), and topical neomycin, polymixin, dexamethasone 0.1% (9/16). Treatment was successful in 11/14 dogs, unsuccessful (enucleation or euthanasia) in 3/14 dogs, and two dogs had inadequate follow-up. Conclusions: Canine ocular onchocerciasis is endemic in New Mexico. Histopathology and molecular identification are useful diagnostic tools. Medical management alone was successful in many cases.

            "text": "Results: Intravitreal injection of endotoxin administration at concentrations \u22650.05 EU/eye resulted in a dose-responsive acute anterior segment inflammation characterized by an increase in aqueous flare and/or aqueous cell. Postdose aqueous flare and aqueous cell scores peaked at 24 and 72 h and resolved by 96 and 168 h, respectively. While variable, quantitative measurements via laser flare photometry correlated with clinical grades of aqueous flare [Grade '0' correlated with a range of 2.8-142.6 (mean = 21.4, SD = 21.5), Grade '1' a range of 30.0-382.1 (mean = 137.8, SD = 110.3), Grade '2' a range of 303.2-387.4 (mean = 340.0, SD = 30.3)]. Conclusion: Endotoxin contamination in ophthalmic formulations intended for intravitreal injection may elicit an inflammatory response at concentrations as low as 0.05 EU/eye in rabbits. This concentration is approximately 4fold lower than a minimal effect extrapolated concentration for intracameral administration(Sakimoto et al., 2009). The response to these relatively low doses of endotoxin is transient, resolving by 168 h. These data highlight the importance of assessing endotoxin level in intravitreal formulations, as levels as low as 0.05 EU/eye may confound the safety evaluations of intravitreal therapeutics in rabbits.

Methods: A survey instrument was developed to gather the information on canine behavior relative to the quality of vision. The instrument was administered online to owners of dogs with normal vision and those of dogs with vision problems (e.g. Progressive Retinal Atrophy). One hundred thirty five questionnaires were completed, with 39% owners reporting dogs with normal vision and the remaining reporting dogs with vision problems. Results: A matrix of 12 questions generated a Chronbach's Alpha of 0.97. The items were used to generate a composite score with a range of 12-60. As expected dogs with normal vision scored on average 12.4, and those with any visual problems scored on average 32.7. The data also show that dogs with Progressive Renal Atrophy scored on average 43.5. Conclusions: CVFI is a valid method for assessing owner perception of canine vision and owner perception correlates with clinical diagnosis. CVFI may be a useful tool in large scale clinical trials or as a method for owners to determine when to seek services of a veterinary ophthalmologist.ABSTRACT NO.: 083The presence of minocycline in the tear film of normal horses following oral administrationCS Monk,* DJ Gibson \u2020 and CE Plummer* , \u2021 *Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida; \u2020 Department of Obstetrics, Shands School of Medicine, University of Florida; \u2021 Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of FloridaPurpose: Tetracyclines have activity against matrix metalloproteinases, a group of collagenolytic enzymes that contribute to keratomalacia. The first aim was to characterize the concentration of minocycline in the tears of normal horses after repeated oral administration of a standard dose. The second aim was to determine if this level directly inhibits collagenase enzyme activity. Methods: Five normal adult ponies were administered oral minocycline (WestLab Pharmacy; Gainesville, FL, USA) at 4 mg/kg every 12 h for 5 days. Tears were collected at baseline and T = 2, 26, 50, 56, 74, 80, 98, and 104 h. Aqueous humor (AH) was collected at T = 104 h. Tears and AH minocycline concentrations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The inhibition of recombinant human MMP-9 by minocyline of similar concentration to that found in vivo (1.25-10 lg/ml) was evaluated using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Results: Minocycline was present in the tears of each pony at every measurement. The mean concentration of 8.9 AE 1.7 lg/ml was present 3 h after administration and fell to 4.1 AE 2.7 lg/ml 8 h after administration. Concentrations in the AH were 0.4 AE 0.0 lg/ml at T = 104 h. No systemic side effects occurred. Minocycline did not directly inhibit MMP-9 function at any of the in vitro levels tested. Conclusions: Oral minocycline was present in the tears of all ponies throughout the study period. The levels did not directly inhibit MMP-9; however, further research is needed to determine if indirect enzymatic inhibition occurs. Supported by University of Florida Resident Research Grant 2014.

ABSTRACT NO.: 084 Trabecular meshwork targeted gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) in beagles with POAG Purpose: To identify structural and functional changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) in the early course of feline congenital glaucoma (FCG). Methods: Nineteen 10-12 week-old cats (11 glaucomatous and 8 control) were studied. IOP was measured three times a week by TonoVet \u00e2 rebound tonometer. ONH cube scans were acquired by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) were recorded with sedation. OCT parameters evaluated included peripapillary thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, cup depth, posterior laminar displacement, width of neural canal opening and pre-laminar tissue thickness. For VEP analysis, RMS amplitude of the early wavelets and peak amplitudes of the late positive component ('P2') were calculated. Optic nerves were quantified using a semi-automated targeted sampling method. Quantitative data from one eye per cat were compared between groups by unpaired t-tests with P-value < 0.05 considered significant. Results: In glaucomatous cats, mean [SD] IOP (18.7 [5.0] mmHg) was significantly higher than normal (12.8 [0.8] mmHg; P = 0.0014) at 10-12 weeks of age. Amplitudes of P2 and early wavelets RMS were significantly lower than normal (P = 0.045 and P = 0.024, respectively). Compared to normal cats, the ONH in FCG had a significantly increased optic cup depth and reduced pre-laminar tissue thickness (P = 0.028 and P = 0.007, respectively). Mean axon count was not significantly different between affected and normal cats. Conclusions: Cats with FCG show IOP elevation, ONH remodeling, and optic nerve functional impairment early in life prior to significant axon loss.

            "text": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the prognosis and impact of ERU on affected horses and their owners by evaluating the signalment, treatment, and outcome (including the loss of use, vision assessment, and economic loss) of horses diagnosed with ERU. This data would be very useful in educating veterinarians and owners on disease prognosis, associated diagnostic and treatment costs, and to prioritize and justify further pathophysiologic and therapeutic research for ERU. Methods: Retrospective Impact Study. Medical records of horses presenting to the NCSU-VHC Equine Ophthalmology Service with a diagnosis of ERU between March 1999 and October 2014 were reviewed. Signalment, clinical signs, ophthalmic examination findings, diagnostics, treatments, and outcomes were evaluated. Owner questionnaires were completed regarding vision, job/role, monetary value, diagnostic and treatment costs, concurrent illness, and outcomes. Results: Records of 224 horses (338 eyes) diagnosed with ERU were reviewed and an over-representation of Appaloosas (54; 24.1%), Hanoverians (11; 5.0%), and other Warmbloods (13; 5.8%) and geldings was observed. Ninety-six eyes (28.4%) were diagnosed as blind and 35 eyes (10.4%) with glaucoma on initial evaluation. Leptospirosis titers of serum and/or aqueous humor were obtained in 88 horses and were positive in 40 horses (45.5%), with L. pomona being the most frequently isolated serovar. This impact of ERU in this study was particularly severe in horses of the Appaloosa breed and in horses having positive titers (serum and/or aqueous humor) to leptospirosis. Furthermore, horses with ocular clinical signs of cataracts, elevated intraocular pressure, and/or vitreal inflammation had poor prognosis for vision. Owner questionnaires revealed that 91 horses (46.9%) were reported blind in the affected eye(s) at the end of this study. Fifty-seven horses (29.4%) did not return to their previous job/role due to ERU, while 61 (31.4%) performed at a reduced level. ERU decreased the estimated monetary value of 164 horses (84.5%). Twenty-nine horses (14.9%) were euthanized and thirty-seven (19.1%) underwent change in ownership as a direct result of ERU. Conclusions: The impact of ERU on the equine industry is attributed to common complications of blindness, globe loss, and loss of function. Euthanasia and change of ownership are common sequelae to the progressive nature of ERU. These factors, along with immense financial costs of the disease, have a significant impact on affected horses and their owners. Supported by Zoetis Animal Health. None. Purpose: To determine the effect of (1) intrastromal injection of voriconazole in the normal equine eye and (2) voriconazole exposure on equine keratocytes. Methods: Five horses, immediately post-euthanasia, underwent intrastromal injection of 1% voriconazole (Vfend; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY, USA) in one eye and 5% in the other eye. A sixth horse underwent injection of sterile water in both eyes as a control. Following injection, aqueocentesis was performed and the samples analyzed for voriconazole concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Globes were enucleated with half of each cornea analyzed by histopathology and half by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In a separate experiment, toxicity from voriconazole exposure on primary culture equine keratocytes was evaluated by MTT assay and morphologic change. Results: Histopathologic evaluation showed stromal delamination but no difference between 1 and 5% solutions. SEM evaluation detected wider cleft formation with 5% solution whereas the area of affected cornea was larger with 1% solution. HPLC revealed maximum aqueous humor voriconazole concentration following injection of 1% voriconazole. Continuous in vitro exposure of keratocytes to voriconazole resulted in total cell death at a 0.5% concentration by 12 h. Conclusions: Injection of 1 and 5% voriconazole results in comparable alteration of corneal morphology immediately post-injection. The highest intraocular drug exposure occurs following injection of 1% voriconazole. Both drug concentrations exceed that which causes complete in vitro toxicity to keratocytes after 12 h of continuous exposure. Supported by OSU RAC grant. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 094 Effects of topical sirolimus on tear production in normal dogs and dogs with refractory dry eye RA Spatola, B Nadelstein, A Berdoulay, RV English, AK Weigt and AC Leber Animal Eye Care Associates Purpose: To evaluate the effects of topical sirolimus on tear production in normal dogs, and dogs with refractory dry eye. Materials/Methods: Normal Eyes: The right eye of ten normal dogs received aqueous 0.02% sirolimus topically, and the left eye a vehicle control, twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline tear production (Schirmer tear test 1) was measured on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Clinical Eyes: Eyes deemed refractory to conventional dry eye therapy were treated with topical 0.02% sirolimus twice daily. Patients were rechecked initially at 2 weeks, followed by every 4 weeks. Recorded data included client questionnaire, Schirmer tear test 1, tonometry, and fluorescein stain. Results: In normal eyes, 60% (6/10) treated with sirolimus experienced an average of 6.2 mm/min increase in tear production compared to the control eye. In refractory dry eye patients, 38% of treated eyes (6/16) responded positively with an average increase in tear production of 8 mm/min (range 5-11 mm/min). Increase in tear production was seen at an average of 21.3 days (18-30 days). The average duration of treatment was 51.2 days (30-91 days). Transient topical irritation was noted in 12.5% (2/16) of treated eyes. Conclusion: Topical aqueous 0.02% sirolimus stimulates tear production in the majority of normal canine eyes, and can stimulate tear production in eyes refractory to conventional dry eye therapy. While these results are encouraging, further pharmacokinetic and clinical studies are needed to determine optimal formulation, dosing, and long-term safety. To determine the effects of frequent topical ophthalmic application of 1% trifluridine solution in dogs with experimentally-induced recurrent ocular canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1) infection. Methods: A randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, 30 day trial was performed using mature laboratory beagles with latent CHV-1 infection. Recurrent ocular CHV-1 infection was experimentally-induced by administration of systemic prednisolone for 7 days. Dogs received 1% trifluridine solution (Viroptic \u00e2 , Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) or artificial tears (placebo) topically in both eyes, six times daily for 2 days, starting on day 4 of prednisolone administration. Treatments were continued four times daily for the following 12 days. Clinical ophthalmic examinations were performed regularly and ocular disease scores were calculated. Ocular swab samples for CHV-1 polymerase chain reaction assays and blood for hemograms, serum biochemistry panels, and CHV-1 serum neutralization antibody titers were collected regularly. Results: Conjunctivitis was detected in all dogs by study day 6. Mean and total clinical ocular disease scores were significantly lower in the trifluridine group compared to the placebo group. The trifluridine group had a significantly shorter median CHV-1 shedding duration compared to the placebo group. Both groups demonstrated an increasing CHV-1 serum neutralization antibody titer trend over time, but no significant differences between groups were present on any sampling day. Hemogram and serum biochemistry panel values were unremarkable throughout the study. Conclusions: Topical ocular application of 1% trifluridine was well tolerated and effective at reducing clinical scores and CHV-1 shedding duration. Trifluridine therapy requires owner compliance with a frequent administration schedule. None. ABSTRACT NO.: 096 MRI visualisation of anesthetic fluid distribution and comparison of two different volumes following subtenon injection in equine cadaver eyes S Stadler,* M Dennler, \u2020 K Voelter,* B Spiess,* U Hetzel \u2021 and S Pot* *Department of Ophthalmology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich; \u2020 Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich; \u2021 Department of Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich Purpose: To visualize the localization and macroscopic distribution of two different anesthetic fluid volumes to find an appropriate volume for a single sub-tenon injection in equine eyes. Methods: A single sub-tenon injection of 2% lidocaine was performed in eight equine cadaver heads (16 eyes) with two different volumes (7 ml on one side, 10 ml on the opposite side). Besides subjective quantification of reflux, the posterior migration and circular distribution of the anesthetic was assessed in sagittal, dorsal and transverse MRI (T2W-TSE) sequences. Circular distribution was quantified and compared between groups via paired t-test. Results: In all injections, the anesthetic expanded from the injection site along the superior and temporal rectus muscle bellies into the intraconal retrobulbar space and did not migrate inferiorly. There was no fluid accumulation directly surrounding the optic nerve. Circular distribution of the anesthetic was not significantly different between groups (P = 1.000). Subjectively the higher dose caused more retrograde leakage of the anesthetic. Conclusions: MRI can detect the distribution of anesthetic fluid of a single subtenon injection. Apart from increased reflux of anesthetic with the 10 ml injection volume, no difference in distribution of anesthetic was observed, between groups. A 7 ml injection volume could therefore be suitable as local anesthesia alternative for ophthalmic surgeries in equines. Purpose: To investigate the use of a compounded 0.5% ophthalmic suspension formulation of the drug megestrol acetate (MA) as a treatment for eosinophilic proliferative keratitis in cats. Methods: Cats with eosinophilic proliferative keratitis but without suggestion of active herpetic disease were eligible for the study. Use of topical anti-inflammatory or anti-viral drugs in the preceding 2 weeks, or oral MA in the preceding 2 months, eliminated cats from the study. All diagnoses were confirmed with cytology. A compounded 0.5% MA suspension was prescribed 2-3 times daily depending on lesion severity. At least 1 recheck examination was required for study inclusion. Blood glucose was measured in 10/ 17 cats during treatment. Results: Seventeen cats participated in the study, 13 with unilateral and 4 with bilateral disease. Fifteen cats responded well and two had no response to treatment. Fourteen cats had improvement at the first recheck. Follow up ranged from 4.5 to 19 months (mean 10 months). No adverse effects were noted and blood glucose levels remained in the reference range for all cats tested. Most cats required ongoing treatment at a frequency of once daily to twice weekly to maintain disease remission. To evaluate the effect of topical ophthalmic 0.005% latanoprost alone and in combination with 0.1% diclofenac in normal horses. Methods: A randomized, masked crossover design was used with 12 normal adult horses (8 mares, 4 geldings). For arm 1, horses were divided into the following groups for treatment in one randomly selected eye once daily; Group D (n = 3, 0.2 ml diclofenac), Group L (n = 3, 0.2 ml latanoprost), and Group DL (n = 6, 0.2 ml latanoprost and 0.2 ml diclofenac). Contralateral eyes were treated with isotonic saline solution. For arm 2, horses from Group D and L were placed into Group DL and horses from Group DL were placed into Group D or L. Evaluations were performed 4 times daily on days 1 and 2 (baseline), days 3-7 (arm 1 treatment), days 8-11 (washout), days 12-16 (arm 2 treatment), and days 17 and 18 (washout). Results: Baseline mean (SD) IOP values for Groups D, L, and DL were 20.5 (2.1), 20.5 (1.9), and 20.7 (2.2) mmHg, respectively; while IOP values were 21.3 (3.5), 18.5 (2.6), and 19.1 (2.5) mmHg during treatment. Differences between baseline and treatment periods were significant for Groups L and DL, but not Group D. Group DL experienced significantly less blepharospasm, blepharoedema, epiphora, and conjunctival hyperemia than Group L. Conclusions: Latanoprost reduced intraocular pressure in normal horses and signs of druginduced discomfort were mitigated by concurrent use of diclofenac. Purpose: To compare a viscous ophthalmic lidocaine hydrochloride preparation to two commonly used ophthalmic anesthetic preparations for the degree and duration of corneal anesthesia by way of corneal aesthesiometry in 24 normal canines (48 eyes). Methods: Each eye was randomly selected to receive two of four treatments at two different time periods separated by a 1 week washout: 3.5% viscous lidocaine hydrochloride (Akten \u00e2 , Akorn Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA), 0.5% aqueous proparacaine hydrochloride (Akorn Inc.), 0.5% viscous tetracaine hydrochloride (TetraViscTM; Ocusoft Inc., Richmond, TX, USA), or 0.9% saline eyewash as a negative control. Corneal sensitivity was determined using a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer (Luneau \u00e2 , Chartres Cedex, France) prior to instillation of each treatment; at 1 and 5 min post treatment; and at 5-min intervals thereafter for 90 min. Ocular side effects were recorded on a scale of 0-3. Results: Mean duration of maximal anesthesia was significantly greater at 34.2 min with tetracaine compared to 21.5 and 19 min with proparacaine and lidocaine respectively. Corneal sensitivity was significantly decreased from baseline for up to 70 min with tetracaine and 55 min with both proparacaine and lidocaine. 24/24 lidocaine treated eyes had blepharospasm and conjunctival hyperemia. 10/24 tetracaine treated eyes had conjunctival hyperemia with 4 of these 10 having concurrent chemosis. Conclusions: Tetracaine provided a significantly longer duration of corneal anesthesia than proparacaine or lidocaine. Tetracaine and lidocaine were associated with more ocular side effects than proparacaine, although these were mild and transient. Purpose: To histologically evaluate depth and width of corneal wounds after diamond burr debridement in canine eyes at different durations of time using three commercially available burr tips. Methods: Ten clinically normal canine eyes were obtained from five client owned dogs after euthanasia. The anterior chamber of each eye was injected with 0.4 ml of sterile formalin at the limbus to maintain intraocular pressure and normal corneal curvature. Plastic tubing dipped in dye was used to delineate two testing fields on each cornea, equidistance from the center. A 1 mm burr was applied to the center of a single testing circle and held in place for 30 s. This was repeated on subsequent testing circles for 1, 2 and 4 min.The study was then repeated using 3.5 mm burr tip and a 5 mm wheel burr tip for a total of 20 measurements. Eyes were then immersion fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely for paraffin embedding. Cross sections of cornea were histologically evaluated for depth and width of corneal wound. Results: There was no difference between the regression relationship of time of debridement and depth of the wound created for all three burr tips meaning each burr debrided more cornea per minute of time. For each minute of debridement corneal wound depth increased by 0.0972 mm (P < 0.1). Conclusions: The size and shape of burr tip has no effect on rate or depth of debridement. Time of debridement has a statistically significant effect on depth of debridement. None.ABSTRACT NO.: 105 Feasibility and use of a novel precision ocular injection Purpose: To establish the safety of topical atropine in healthy horses by objectively measuring gastrointestinal motility. Methods: Phase 1: Three horses were randomly assigned to receive topical 1% atropine (Bausch and Lomb, Tampa, FL, USA) OS QID (group A), while three horses were treated with artificial tears OS QID (group B). After 24 h of treatment, horses were administered 200 non-toxic beads via nasogastric intubation and ophthalmic treatments were decreased to BID and continued for a total of 5 days. At every topical administration time point, PLRs, presence of mydriasis, heart rate, and intestinal motility (assessed via fecal bead passage, girth measurements, auscultable gut sounds, fecal weights, clinical signs of abdominal pain) were monitored. Following a 4-week washout period, Phase 2 began in which the protocol was repeated, except group A received artificial tears and group B received 1% atropine. Results: No horses experienced signs of colic, ileus or decreased fecal output, during any time point of the study. Heart rate, girth measurements, and auscultable gut sounds remained consistent throughout the study. Complete mydriasis with absence of PLR was seen OS in 5/6 horses within 6 h of the first atropine dose and in 6/6 horses within 12 h of initial atropine administration. One horse experienced complete mydriasis in the untreated OD by day 5 of atropine treatment. Purpose: To evaluate vitreous degeneration as a potential predisposing factor for retinal detachment following phacoemulsification surgery in dogs. Methods: Records of 70 dogs (111 eyes) that had preoperative ocular ultrasound and phacoemulsification between September 28, 2006 and May 1, 2014 at a private practice were reviewed. Ultrasound images were reviewed by two observers independently and vitreous echogenicity was graded based on a previously established grading scheme. The following factors were compared between eyes with and without retinal detachment: signalment, operated eye, presence of diabetes mellitus, stage of cataract, presence of lens-induced uveitis, preoperative ocular hypertension or glaucoma, preoperative anterior vitreous presentation, preoperative or intraoperative lens instability, operating surgeon, preoperative or concurrent retinopexy, posterior or equatorial capsular tears, radial tears, phacoemulsification time, use of vitrectomy, placement of an artificial lens, and brand and type of artificial lens. Follow up time was recorded. Presence and time from surgery to onset of postoperative complications including blindness, retinal detachment, glaucoma and endophthalmitis were recorded. Retinal detachment was diagnosed based on observation via indirect ophthalmoscopy, ocular ultrasound, or based on supportive findings such as diffuse hyphema. Results: There was no statistically significant correlation between vitreous degeneration and postoperative retinal detachment. There was no statistically significant correlation between postoperative retinal detachment and any evaluated factors. Retinal detachment was confirmed or suspected in seven eyes (6.31%). Vitreous degeneration was observed via ultrasound by at least one observer in 77 eyes (69.37%). Conclusions: Ultrasonically identifiable vitreous degeneration does not correlate with increased risk of retinal detachment following phacoemulsification. None.",
