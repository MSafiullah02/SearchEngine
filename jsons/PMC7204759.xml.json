Only very limited (or even no) safety data are available about a potential interaction and added risk for more frequent or severe pulmonary toxicity, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients. We could extrapolate from experiences with other viral or bacterial pulmonary infections, where we have learned when to postpone or interrupt radiotherapy vs. when it is sufficiently safe to treat. We could also extrapolate the potential harm to lung cancer patients in delaying or interrupting radiotherapy for a short period of time until the patient is recovered and not infectious anymore. Additionally, we proposed factors to be considered in the decision-making process whether to interrupt radiotherapy in patients treated with radical radiotherapy and diagnosed as COVID-19 positive: COVID-19-related symptoms, symptoms of lung cancer, and infection with COVID-19 near the end of treatment. These factors do allow balancing the patient-individual risks of the COVID-19 infection and lung cancer. Ultimately, however, there is very limited evidence to guide the trade-offs between the reduced oncologic control from delays (or interruptions) in treatment vs. the potential harms from radiating a patient with an active COVID-19 infection.",

We are hopeful that eventually there will be broad immunity to COVID-19 (preferably through vaccination), which will make modifications of radiotherapy practice in patients with and without COVID-19 infection redundant, at least from a public health perspective.",
