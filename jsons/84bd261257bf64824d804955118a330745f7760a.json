            "text": "In China, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 was first identified in the city of Wuhan and had spread rapidly across the whole country. To control COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese government had implemented a range of strict quarantine managements for different population. Patients with COVID-19 were isolated in hospital, whereas close-contacts and the frontline medical personnel were quarantined in hotel. Notably, all the residents were under home-quarantine during the peak of pandemic, except those who guaranteed the basic functions of a city. These critical control measures substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19, with conceivable impacts on people's daily life. We, here, use a mental health survey data to test that whether the mental health problems were related to quarantine or not.",

In total, 1443 participants with quarantine (i.e., 206 close-contacts and 320 frontline medical personnel under hotel-quarantine, and 917 public residents under home-quarantine) and 836 participants without quarantine were recruited (i.e., 538 non-frontline medical personnel and 298 community support workers). The survey was completed after more than 10 days in quarantine and the same month for the participants with and without quarantine, respectively. The current work was approved by the ethics committees of the Fifth Hospital of Ruian. The 20-item Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), 7item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), were administered to screen the general psychological symptoms (i.e., \u22657 in SRQ-20), anxiety (i.e., \u22655 in GAD-7) and depression (i.e., \u22655 in PHQ-9), respectively. The Cronbach's alpha for SRQ-20, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 was 0.884, 0.935, and 0.913, separately. In addition, participants were required to rate their subjective perception of impacts on daily life due to COVID-19 pandemic (0 -not at all; 1 -affected a little; 2 -affected a lot; and 3 -extremely affected).",

However, these mental health problems were not related with the control measure of quarantine, but the impacts on daily life. This finding is unusual but not unique (e.g., Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2020) . During the H1N1 epidemic, we also found no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in college students (Wang et al., 2011) . Instead, the dissatisfaction with control measures significantly predicted their negative psychological consequences. We endorse that, if quarantine is essential, the officials should take measures to ensure that this experience is acceptable and tolerable. Further studies should pay more attention to identify the potential psychological risk factors associated with the mental health problems under quarantine.",
