Noroviruses are divided into seven different genogroups (GI-GVII) and further subdivided into numerous genotypes [2]. Noroviruses grouped into GI, GII and GIV mainly infect humans but also other species, while GV infects mice. The GII genotype 4 (GII.4) cause the majority of infections with novel outbreak strains emerging every 2\u20133 years, likely in a response to an immunological pressure of herd immunity [3\u20135].",

The huNoV genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs), where ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins (NS1-7) involved in viral replication, ORF 2 encodes the capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a small structural protein. Murine noroviruses (MNV) additionally encode an ORF4 from an alternative reading frame located in ORF2, termed virulence factor 1 (VF1), involved in antagonism of the host innate immune response [7]. The 5\u2019 end of the genome contains a short 5 nucleotide untranslated region (UTR) and the 3\u2019end contains a short UTR and poly-A tail (reviewed in [8]). The norovirus genome is covalently linked at the 5\u2019end with the viral protein VPg (also termed NS5). ORF1 is translated from the full-length genomic RNA, whereas ORF2, ORF3, and ORF4 are mainly translated from a VPg linked subgenomic RNA (reviewed in [8]).",

            "text": "ORF1 encodes a large, approximately 200 kDa, polyprotein that is processed by the viral protease NS6, giving rise to 6 mature nonstructural proteins involved in viral replication and several precursor proteins with potentially additional, yet poorly defined functions (reviewed in [8]). The function of the most N-terminal protein (termed NS1-2 or p48) is unclear. huNoV NS1-2 varies in size (approximately 40\u201348 kDa) and contains an N-terminal disordered region and a C-terminal predicted trans-membrane domain [9]. The central domain further shows homology to the NlpC/p60 superfamily of enzymes, with diverse hydrolase functions [10]. Genogroup I NS1-2 has been shown to localize to the Golgi complex and induce Golgi disassembly, dependent upon the C-terminal hydrophobic region [11]. MNV NS1/2 contains 2 sites cleaved by murine caspase 3 and has been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon transient expression [12,13]. NS3 (also termed NTPase, 2C-like and p41) has been demonstrated to function as an NTPase in vitro for GI [14]. NS3 has also been shown to co-localize with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) during MNV infection [15]. NS4 (also called p20, p22 or 3A-like) function remains unclear, although NS4 has been demonstrated to disrupt ER to Golgi trafficking resulting in Golgi disassembly during norovirus replication [16]. NS4 has also been shown to inhibit actin cytoskeleton remodeling in an epithelial cell line upon transient expression [17]. Upon MNV infection, NS4 was shown to localize to the replication complex [15], and upon transient expression shown to localize to endosomes [13]. NS5 is linked to the 5\u2019 end of the genome and plays an integral role in the initiation of translation through its interaction with eukaryotic initiation factors and likely primes genome and subgenomic RNA synthesis [18]. The viral protease NS6 (also called Pro or 3C-like) is a well characterized cysteine protease and responsible for the cleavage and processing of the viral ORF1 polyprotein [12,19]. Lastly, NS7 (also called RdRp) functions as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase in viral replication and transcription of subgenomic RNAs [20,21]).",

            "text": "Membrane rearrangements play a key role in the establishment of viral replication complexes for positive strand RNA viruses. In principle these membrane alterations can be subdivided into two morphotypes (reviewed in [22,23]). First, the \u201cinvagination type\u201d consists of single membrane invaginations of a donor membrane which stay connected to the cytoplasm via a pore and are represented by alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Viral replication takes place inside these vesicles and the viral RNA contributes to their morphology [24], with the exception of Brome mosaic virus 1a protein which generates spherules in absence of RNA replication [25]. Second, the \u201cDMV-type\u201d consists of vesicular and tubular membrane rearrangements wrapped by one (single membrane vesicle, SMV), two (double membrane vesicles, DMVs) and multiple membranes (multi membrane vesicles, MMVs), induced by picornaviruses, coronaviruses and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Most of these structures have no visible connection to the cytoplasm and the functional significance of the different vesicle subtypes as well as the localization of the RNA synthesis machinery is still a matter of debate. However, these structures can typically be induced simply by expression of the replicase proteins in absence of RNA replication, exemplified by picornaviruses [26\u201329] and HCV [30\u201332]. Sole expression of individual nonstructural proteins already induces distinct membrane alterations, which are less complex than those derived from the polyprotein. Still, such studies have allowed the identification of those viral proteins contributing to the morphogenesis of viral replication sites and the unraveling of some of their functions [26\u201328,30,31,33\u201335]. In the case of HCV, virus induced membrane alterations have been identified as efficient drug targets for silibinin [36], direct acting antivirals like NS5A inhibitors [37] and host targeting drugs like cyclophilin inhibitors [38].",

            "text": "Our understanding of the ultrastructure of huNoV replication organelles is currently scarce, mostly due to the lack of efficient cell culture models [39]. A replicon model has been established in case of GI noroviruses [40], but no ultrastructural analysis is currently available. A plasmid driven GII.3 replicon model allows moderate RNA replication levels, but it remains difficult to dissect the contribution of protein expression and bona fide RNA replication in this system [41]. Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in cultivating the more clinically relevant GII.4 strains in both B-cells [42] and enteric organoids [43], still neither of these models has yet been proven to allow ultrastructural studies. Therefore, most of our knowledge of norovirus induced membrane alterations has been obtained using the MNV model [44]. Previous studies showed accumulations of vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected macrophages consisting of single and double membrane vesicles, which have not been further characterized [44]. In addition, it has been shown that MNV induced vesicle clusters co-localize with all MNV NS proteins and with viral replication intermediates and that these extensive rearrangements of intracellular membranes are mainly derived from the secretory pathway, including ER, Golgi and endosomal membranes [15]. Furthermore, the MNV replication organelles seem tightly associated with the cytoskeleton, probably mediated by the main capsid protein [45]. Little is known so far about the contribution of individual nonstructural proteins to virus induced replication vesicles, but it is believed that NS1-2 and NS4 are the main drivers in this process due to their membrane association and comparison to picornavirus proteins (reviewed in [8]). In addition, NS3 is associated with membranes and recently has been shown to be associated with highly motile vesicular structures [13,46].",

Membrane structures induced by expression of the polyprotein of three important outbreak strains (Den Haag 2006, New Orleans 2009 and Sydney 2012) comprised SMV, DMV and MMV structures. We further observed that SMVs and DMVs were reminiscent of structures found upon MNV infection. The impact of individual GII.4 NS proteins on intracellular membranes was studied by correlative light and electron microscopy, allowing the localization of each protein within the cellular ultrastructural context. GII.4 NS1-2 induced membrane proliferation of the smooth ER, which was strikingly different from MNV NS1/2. NS3 was tightly associated with lipid droplets (LDs) and induced convoluted membranes. However, only NS4 expression was sufficient to induce SMV and DMV formation, much like the ability of HCV NS5A and poliovirus (PV) 3AB to induce DMVs.",

            "text": "We first aimed to evaluate whether structures induced by ORF1 expression indeed resembled those found in infected cells using MNV as a model, ideally using the same cell type as intended for huNoV. We therefore generated Huh7-CD300lf cells stably expressing the MNV receptor [47,48] and verified that these cells were indeed permissive for MNV infection by demonstrating the presence of NS3 24h after infection (S1A and S1B Fig). In addition, MNV infected Huh7-CD300lf cells produced similar amounts of progeny virus compared to RAW 264.7 cells, albeit with slightly delayed kinetics (S1C Fig). In contrast, Huh7 cells lacking CD300lf failed to amplify the virus inoculum (S1C Fig). Therefore, ectopic expression of CD300lf rendered Huh7 cells fully permissive for MNV infection and supported the entire MNV replication cycle. Ultrastructural analysis of MNV infected Huh7-CD300lf revealed two major phenotypes not observed in uninfected cells (Fig 1): (1) Areas containing vesicles with a variety of shapes, sizes and types (Fig 1A). In addition to previously reported SMVs, more complex structures like DMVs and MMVs were found, often in proximity to lipid droplets (LD). This phenotype likely resembled an early replication phase described previously [44]. (2) A massive rearrangement of the entire endomembrane system consisting of complex structures, often associated with virions, and lacking an organized morphology was observed during what was likely a later stage of the replication cycle [44] (Fig 1B). We found similar phenotypes in RAW 264.7 cells (S2 Fig), which have been used in previous studies to characterize the ultrastructure of the MNV replication organelle [15,44], except that these cells lacked LDs (S2 Fig). We next analyzed whether similar structures were generated by expression of MNV ORF1. MNV ORF1 was expressed in Huh7 T7 cells under transcriptional control of the T7 promoter and translational control of an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (EMCV IRES), allowing efficient cytoplasmic expression of proteins of interest in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase (Fig 2A and 2B). For ultrastructural analysis we used chemical fixation (CF) or high-pressure freezing (HPF) (Fig 2C). Regardless of the fixation technique, we identified basically the same types of membrane alterations observed in phenotype 1 of MNV infected cells: vesiculated areas with SMVs, DMVs and MMVs, again in close proximity to LDs, whereas phenotype 2 (complex membrane structures lacking organized morphology) was not found upon expression of ORF1.",

We first tested the expression of the different ORF1 proteins and their processing to assess the integrity of the polyproteins. In a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (S3A Fig) most of NS-proteins remained buried in precursors, which according to their sizes could represent the entire ORF1 and NS4-NS7 (S3A Fig). Mature cleavage products were only found for NS1-2 and/or NS3, however the size of these proteins was almost identical. This result was in line with previous data studying ORF1 in vitro processing of GII.4 [43,52]. In addition, we assessed polyprotein expression and processing by Western blotting (WB) after transfection of the plasmids encoding the three ORF1 proteins into Huh7 T7 cells. We could detect cleavage products corresponding to NS3, (S3B Fig), NS7 (S3C Fig) and NS1-2, the latter by expressing N-terminal eGFP tagged ORF1 from the NO isolate since we lacked a specific antibody (S3G Fig). No distinct cleavage products were observed for NS4, NS5 and NS6 (S3D\u2013S3F Fig), indicating that they might be retained in relatively stable precursor proteins, as suggested by in vitro translation.",

The average diameter of DMVs was approximately 100\u2013200 nm (Fig 3B), and resembled structures found upon HCV and picornavirus infection [28,31,53\u201356]. Most membrane alterations induced by ORF1 expression in Huh7 cells were again found in close association with LDs, similar to MNV. Overall, no consistent differences were found between ORF1 expression and infection regarding the ratio of SMVs, DMVs and MMVs (Fig 3C). However, high variability in vesicles size was observed among cells of the same condition, likely due to differences in protein abundance, time of infection, cell type, etc. Still, SMVs were by far the most abundant vesicle species in all conditions.",

            "text": "The N-terminal protein of norovirus ORF1 is thought to induce membrane rearrangements and is considered to be involved in replication complex formation (reviewed in [8]). First, we examined the localization of eGFP-NS1-2 with respect to subcellular markers by immunofluorescence (Fig 5A). Interestingly, eGFP-NS1-2 had a very peculiar filamentous subcellular distribution in most cells (Fig 5A). A minority of cells showed a focal distribution of NS1-2 or an intermediate phenotype (Fig 5A, white and yellow asterisk, respectively). Since the filamentous localization was observed for N-terminally HA-tagged NS1-2, an artifact caused by eGFP fusion can be excluded (Fig 5C). We found a significant co-localization of NS1-2 with a marker of the ER, judged by Pearson correlation values above 0.5 (Fig 5A and 5B). Next, we used CLEM to determine the ultrastructural morphology of NS1-2-GFP positive structures (Fig 5D). Here, regions with strong eGFP fluorescence, indicating high NS1-2 expression, were represented by a network of tubular membrane protrusions. The absence of ribosomes associated with these structures, and the general co-localization of NS1-2 with an ER marker indicated that these membrane protrusions originated from the smooth ER. It is interesting to note that similar tubular structures can be induced by overexpression of ER-shaping proteins such as REEP1 and CLIMP-63 through direct interaction with microtubules [57]. However, we found no indication for a co-localization of NS1-2 induced ER-tubules with microtubules or intermediate filaments (S6C and S6D Fig). In addition we analyzed co-localization of eGFP-NS1-2 and NS3 upon expression of eGFP-ORF1 (S6E and S6F Fig) to assess the impact of the polyprotein on eGFP-NS1-2 localization. Interestingly, we found a variety of phenotypes in various cells, ranging from a focal distribution of both proteins (upper panel) to the filamentous localization of NS1-2 observed upon individual expression (lowest panel). This result indicated a mutual impact of the NS proteins on their subcellular localization, retaining significant co-localization in all cases (S6F Fig), as reported for MNV [15]. Since the distribution of GII.4 NS1-2 was very different from the pattern reported for NS1/2 of MNV [13], we further analyzed eGFP-NS1/2 of MNV by CLEM (S7 Fig). Interestingly and in concordance with literature, NS1/2 of MNV was widely distributed throughout the cell and co-localized with the ER (S7B Fig). However, we found no indications for specific membrane structures induced by MNV NS1/2 (S7C Fig) comparable to those found for GII.4 NO. The MNV NS1/2 signal could be often correlated with membranes surrounding LDs (S7C Fig), which may represent the ring like structures described in a previous study [13].",

NS3 significantly co-localized with markers of the Golgi apparatus, rough ER and LDs (Fig 6A and 6C). We also characterized the subcellular localization of NS3 upon expression of ORF1 (S8A\u2013S8C Fig). Again we found some co-localization of NS3 with ER and LDs (S8A and S8C Fig), albeit to a lesser extent as in case of individually expressed NS3. In contrast, very little co-localization with several other markers of membranous intracellular organelles was observed, including Golgi apparatus (S8C Fig), suggesting again a mutual impact of the NS proteins on their subcellular localization. The tight association of GII.4 NS3 with LDs was also validated in CLEM experiments (Fig 6B). Donut like structures of NS3 observed in IF were indeed NS3-studded membrane layers surrounding LDs (area 1). Interestingly, large foci with strong NS3 but weak LD signal were found to represent highly ordered membrane proliferations and were often observed in close proximity to one or more LDs (area 2, 3). Such convoluted membranes were similar to previously described OSER (organized smooth ER) membranes with cubic symmetry (reviewed in [58,59]). However, we did not observe these structures upon ORF1 expression (Fig 3). Overall, our findings indicate that GII.4 NS3 was found on different membrane compartments of the secretory pathway and was closely associated to intracellular lipid storage compartments.",

Still, the eGFP-NS4 signal tended to accumulate in larger clusters compared to the majority of eGFP-NS3 (Fig 7A and 7B), but also co-localized with markers of ER, Golgi apparatus and LDs (Fig 7A and 7B). CLEM analysis identified several interesting types of membrane alterations in areas with strong eGFP signal, in agreement with the idea that NS4 is a key driver in the formation of the norovirus replication compartment. Donut like structures were found to be membranes tightly associated with LDs (Fig 7B, area 2), similar to those found for NS3 (Fig 6B). In addition, large eGFP-NS4 positive foci found in close proximity to LDs consisted of vesicle clusters composed of DMVs and SMVs (Fig 7B, area 3, 4; 7C, area 5). The size and morphology of NS4 induced DMVs was very similar to those observed upon expression of the polyprotein (Fig 7D compared to Fig 3B), but their abundance was apparently lower. In contrast, SMVs were much more abundant and heterogeneous in size, with a diameter ranging from 50 nm to 300 nm, although more than ~80% had a diameter <100 nm (Fig 7E). These data suggested that NS4 on its own was capable of inducing vesicle accumulations reminiscent of vesicle clusters of the GII.4 replication compartment. Finally, similarly to NS3, highly fluorescent clusters of NS4 within the cells corresponded to regions forming regularly shaped membrane lattices (Fig 7C, areas 6 and 7). However, NS4 expression resulted in membranes aligned predominantly in tubules with hexagonal symmetry (Fig 7C, area 6). This hexagonal symmetry appeared very similar to the arrangement observed upon overexpression of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase [60], although regions with cubic symmetry were also observed (Fig 7C, area 7). Furthermore, NS4 induced crystalline membrane structures were found in proximity to vesicle clusters (Fig 7C, area 1), suggesting that their formation might be concentration dependent and a consequence of very high local concentrations of NS4.",

Since the functions of all three proteins, in particular NS1-2 and NS4, are widely enigmatic, we next aimed to generate structural models based on secondary structure analysis and homology searches, allowing for the development of hypotheses accessible to experimental validation. There are no close homologs of known structures for these three proteins, but advanced search methods unambiguously detect distant homologs (20% sequence identity) for parts of both NS1-2 and NS3. These together with secondary structure predictions show that the 334-residue NS1-2 can be described as a three-partite protein with an unstructured N-terminus (residues 1\u2013110) followed by a papain-like thiol hydrolase domain (residues ca 120\u2013230) that is related to a family of phospholipases and acyltransferases [61], and finally a hydrophobic domain (residues ca 250\u2013310) with one or possibly two transmembrane helices. We can thus draw two possible topologies for membrane association of NS1-2 (Fig 8A). Interestingly, the catalytic cysteine and histidine of the putative thiol hydrolase are both present in NS1-2 as C205 and H139. The 366-residue NS3 is a distant homolog of AAA ATPases with an extra 50 residues at the N-terminus comprising a hydrophobic helix that could be transmembrane. Again, we have two possibilities for NS3 membrane association. Finally, we could find no homolog of known structure for the 179-residue NS4, but secondary structure predictions show that its approximately 140 N-terminal residues are highly structured and end in an amphipathic helix connecting to a natively unfolded C-terminus (Fig 8A).",

Since these residues are invariant in all norovirus genogroups, we used MNV as a surrogate model to study their functional importance for norovirus replication. Interestingly, both NS1-2 mutants affected the abundance of the filamentous phenotype (Fig 8B\u20138D), arguing for a contribution of the putative hydrolase domain to the generation of tubular ER protrusions. Albeit mutations H139A and C205A both resulted in an increased abundance of the intermediate phenotype, or a focal distribution of eGFP-NS1-2, all variants still remained localized to the ER (Fig 8E). Importantly, both residues were indeed essential for norovirus replication, as mutations at the corresponding positions H150A and C216A of MNV NS1-2 abrogated the production of infectious virus (Fig 8F).",

ORF1 expression generated vesicle accumulations comparable to those observed in MNV infected cells, mainly consisting of SMVs, DMVs and MMVs. Therefore, norovirus-induced membrane alterations can be generated in the absence of active RNA synthesis, and are reminiscent of picornaviruses and HCV [28,31,53\u201356]. Our data indicate that NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 are the main drivers in the formation of GII.4 replication organelles. However, only NS4 generated SMVs and DMVs similar to those observed upon ORF1 expression and MNV infection. These data provide the first experimental evidence for the hypothesis that NS4 might be the key factor in the morphogenesis of norovirus replication organelles (reviewed in [8]).",

            "text": "Previous studies on the ultrastructure of MNV replication organelles in RAW 264.7 cells reported on the appearance of vesiculated areas consisting of SMVs and DMVs at 12h post infection, progressing to a complete destruction of ER and Golgi at later time points, coinciding with the accumulation of virions [44]. We found in principle the same two phenotypes upon MNV infection of Huh7-CD300lf cells and in RAW 264.7 cells. ORF1 expression induced structures very similar to the phenotype lacking virions, likely corresponding to an early/intermediate infection stage, but did not progress into the complex endomembrane system observed concomitantly to intracellular virions appearance. Progression to the late stages found in infection might require the presence of the structural proteins or resemble cytopathic effects induced by infection, but not by ORF1 expression. Interestingly, we found no obvious difference in the membrane rearrangements induced by ORF1 or MNV compared to any of the three GII.4 isolates included in this study, arguing for similar mechanisms driving these processes in various norovirus genogroups and validating MNV as a useful surrogate model to study particular aspects of general norovirus biology. Still, our data obtained upon GII.4 ORF1 expression will ultimately require validation in a cell culture model with bona fide RNA replication, such as the recently established enteric organoid cultures [43] or infection of B cells [42]. The same holds true for the functional significance of the LD association we found for GII.4 NS3 and NS4. While LDs are clearly not essential for MNV replication, since they are not detectable in RAW 264.7 cells, we found them close to all virus induced membrane alterations in Huh7 cells, both, upon expression of ORF1 and upon MNV infection. Whether this is co-incidence due to high LD abundance in Huh7 cells or whether LDs have a functional significance in GII.4 replication remains to be determined. At this point we have not been able to detect membrane alterations that could unequivocally be assigned to norovirus infection by EM in norovirus infected enteroid cultures (S. Boulant, personal communication), likely due to the yet limited efficiency of this model and the high percentage of infected cells required for a thorough EM analysis. However, further optimization of culture conditions will hopefully allow such studies in the future, as well as the establishment of a reverse genetics model for GII.4 isolates.",

            "text": "Our ultrastructural analysis does not allow drawing firm conclusions on the origin and biogenesis of GII.4 induced SMVs, since we did not observe such vesicles directly connected to cellular membranes. In contrast to PV, we could not find evidence for an interconnected tubular network [55]. Most of our evidence points to membranes of the ER as the origin of SMVs, similar to MNV [15], due to the co-localization of NS1-2 and NS3 with ER membranes when expressed in the context of ORF1. Furthermore, our tomograms reveal a close proximity of the induced vesicles to ER membranes. Finally, individually expressed NS1-2, NS3 and NS4 all at least in part co-localize to and rearrange ER membranes. Therefore, huNoV, like many other viruses, may hijack this cell organelle to generate its replication organelles (reviewed in [62]). Regarding DMVs and MMVs, we were able to identify intermediate structures. Many vesicles appearing as DMVs in a single plane were in fact MMVs in stato nascendi, generated by enwrapping vesicles with collapsed, elongated SMVs or ER cisternae. DMVs might originate as well from collapsing SMVs. This indeed closely resembles the mechanisms demonstrated for picornaviruses [55,56]. Finally, our tomograms also showed a variety of complex structures (e.g. MVBs, ALS) that might be linked to the biogenesis of these vesicles, however these structures are currently difficult to interpret regarding their functional significance. Overall, our data suggest that norovirus induced membrane alterations are very closely related to picornavirus replication organelles with respect to both morphology and biogenesis. The relatively low abundance of DMVs and MMVs further argues for a non-essential role in norovirus infection, again in line with reports on picornaviruses, where replication most likely occurs on single membrane structures, whereas the appearance of DMVs is associated with later stages of infection [55,56].",

The sequence of NS1-2 is highly divergent between different norovirus genogroups with no specific function assigned thus far. Bioinformatic analysis proposed an unstructured N-terminal region, which was confirmed biochemically [9], a central domain with potential hydrolase function [10] and a C-terminal transmembrane domain [9,63]. Norwalk virus NS1-2 was shown to disrupt the Golgi apparatus [11], whereas MNV NS1-2 mainly localizes to the ER [13]. Our data now show a very peculiar filamentous localization of GII.4 NS1-2 which could be identified as tubular protrusions of the smooth ER when analyzed by CLEM. Similar structures have been observed upon overexpression of cellular ER remodeling proteins such as REEP1 and CLIMP-63 through direct interaction with microtubules [57], which appear to be the driving force in protruding the tubules. In the case of NS1-2, we found no co-localization with microtubules or intermediate filaments, therefore it is currently not clear how the ER-tubules are expanded. Since mutations in the active site of the putative hydrolase domain severely affected the formation of the tubular ER-protrusions, it is tempting to speculate about a role of this predicted enzymatic function in the membrane shaping activity of NS1-2. However, the functional significance of the ability of GII.4 NS1-2 to form filamentous ER tubules still remains unclear, since MNV NS1/2 is devoid of this property. Overall these data are suggestive for the presence of an enzymatic activity residing in NS1-2, but they clearly provide no formal proof, which will require the demonstration of such activity in a purified protein. Interestingly, a recent study identified an interaction of the variable, unstructured N-terminus of MNV NS1/2 with the host proteins VAPA and VAPB, critical for viral replication [64]. VAPA has already been observed to complex with Norwalk NS1-2 [65], presumably via a different, yet to be defined region. More strikingly, VAPA and VAPB have been implicated in the biogenesis of the HCV replication compartment via interaction with NS5A (reviewed in [23]). Therefore, VAPA and VAPB interactions might contribute to the function of NS1-2 in the formation of the norovirus replication organelle, or even be a common host factor of many DMV-type positive strand RNA viruses.",

Interestingly, similar structures have been found upon expression of HAV 2C and 2BC, with the former regarded as the functional counterpart of norovirus NS3 in picornaviruses [34]. These structures clearly resemble OSER membranes with cubic (NS3) and hexagonal (NS4) symmetry. It has been reported that OSER structures can be generated through weak protein-protein interactions, which can even be triggered by overexpression of GFP tagged to cytochrome b(5), with the GFP moiety providing the homotypic interactions [66]. Therefore, we currently cannot exclude that the fusion of NS3 and NS4 with eGFP, required for CLEM, also contributed to this phenotype. However, it seems unlikely that these structures are essential for viral replication, since they have not been observed so far in either MNV infected cells or upon ORF1 overexpression [15,44]. Therefore, the ability of NS3 and NS4 to induce cubic membranes might point to an intrinsic property, probably weak homotypic interactions, and seems to be linked to strong overexpression of single NS proteins. Upon ORF1 expression and virus infection, such structures might be prevented due to the interactions among NS-proteins and by lower local concentrations of individual NS-proteins. Also in the case of HAV, cubic membranes were only found upon 2C/2BC overexpression [34] but not in HAV infected cells [28].",

A similar localization pattern was previously found for MNV NS3 in Vero cells, but not tested for LD localization at that point [13]. Interestingly, NS1-2 co-localized to NS3 on LDs in most cells upon expression of ORF1, whereas this LD association was never found upon sole expression of GII.4 NS1-2. This result argues for an additional role of NS3 in recruiting NS1-2 upon formation of the viral replication organelle, probably involving direct interactions. The recently observed localization of MNV NS3 with microtubules and cholesterol rich lipids when transiently expressed in Vero cells [45,46] further argues for a function of NS3 in shaping the replication organelle. Whether or not the NTPase activity, which has been demonstrated for the NS3 protein of GI.1 [14], is important for localization and membrane activity of NS3 remains to be determined. However, the most obvious putative function of NS3 in RNA replication is a supposed helicase activity, suggested by conserved SF3 helicase motifs [67]. Still to date, only the related 2C protein from the picornavirus Enterovirus 71 has been shown to function as an ATP dependent helicase [68].",

            "text": "NS4 is by far the most enigmatic among the norovirus NS proteins and little is currently known about its structure or function. Here, we provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting that NS4 indeed might be the central organizer of the norovirus replication complex. In contrast to HCV, where all NS proteins can induce the formation of vesicular structures [31], NS4 was, in our hands, the only GII.4 protein capable of vesicle formation upon individual expression. In addition, SMVs and DMVs were found, similar to MNV infection and ORF1 expression, albeit with differing abundance. Altogether, these data suggest that NS4 may be the key driver in the formation of norovirus induced replication vesicles, requiring auxiliary functions of NS1-2 and NS3 to finally shape the replication organelles. This is reminiscent of HCV, where the complexity of the so called membranous web is only found upon expression of a polyprotein precursor encoding NS3 to NS5B, arguing for a concerted action engaging several NS-proteins [31,33]. In the case of picornaviruses, 2BC [27], 2BC/3A [26], 2C [34,69] and 3AB [35] have been found to generate distinct membrane alterations upon individual expression, with 2BC/3A and 3AB generating DMVs. However the ultrastructure of the replication organelles is far more complex upon infection also in case of picornaviruses [55]. Still, it is interesting to note that the unrelated proteins NS5A of HCV and 3A of PV are capable of inducing DMVs and share a similar structural organization. Specifically, both contain a unique structured region lacking enzymatic functions, which has been resolved for HCV NS5A [70] and PV 3A [71], an intrinsically unfolded region engaged in recruitment of host factors [72\u201374] and a membrane attachment region. Our current prediction for the organization of NS4, albeit highly speculative at this point, is strikingly similar regarding subdomain organization and functions (Fig 8A). This model will provide a valuable starting point for further in depth studies regarding the function of norovirus NS4.",

Our study, including three different GII.4 strains suggests a delayed cleavage of the NS4-NS7 precursor, based on in vitro translation. However, a far more detailed analysis of polyprotein cleavage kinetics using a different GII.4 strain suggests a number of cleavage intermediates with NS4, including NS4-NS7, NS4-NS6 and NS4-NS5 [52], which might serve specific functions in the norovirus replication cycle. It is particularly tempting to speculate that delayed cleavage of NS4-NS7 might avoid diffusion of the replicase components, since NS4 seems the only protein associated with membranes in this precursor protein.",

Alternatively, and still in line with the predictions, NS1-2 could span the membrane twice and NS3 may harbor an amphipathic alpha helix tethering the protein to membranes, thereby keeping the NS6 cleavage site in the cytoplasm. Regardless, the transmembrane topology of NS1-2 and NS3 can be experimentally addressed in future studies using our expression model and, for example, testing the accessibility of N- and C-termini to proteases in cell lysates.",

In the case of HCV, comparable expression models have been invaluable to study formation and structure of the viral replication organelles as they allow mechanistic studies using replication deficient mutants or inhibitors interfering with replication. Thereby, the contribution of viral NS-proteins could be clearly defined [31,33] in addition to the importance of host factors like PI4KA [75,76]. Only expression models allowed us to identify viral membrane alterations as targets of direct antiviral agents (NS5A inhibitors [37]) and host targeting drugs including PI4KA inhibitors [75] and cyclophilin inhibitors [38]. Similar approaches might help to identify novel strategies to develop drugs targeting norovirus replication in future studies. Furthermore, our study lays the groundwork for an in-depth analysis of the functions of NS1-2 and NS4 in replication complex formation.",

After 24 hours, cells were transfected with 15 \u03bcg of pMNV-CW1 plasmid DNA using TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirrus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, USA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Transfections were incubated for 48 hours. Virus stocks were obtained by harvesting the cells in their culture medium and twice freezing at -80\u00b0C and then thawing at 37\u00b0C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 2500 x g for 5 minutes and clarified virus stocks were stored at -80\u00b0C. To determine virus titers, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 96 well tissue culture plates (Corning, Durham, NC, USA) at a density of 2x104 cells per well. After 24 hours, wells were infected in quadruplicate with serial dilutions of virus stocks diluted in DMEM medium. Assays were harvested 72 hours post infection by aspirating supernatant, washing with PBS and staining with 50 \u03bcl of a 1.25% (w/v) crystal violet solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a 25% (v/v) ethanol solution for 10 minutes at room temperature. The wells were washed twice with distilled water and scored as positively infected or negative. The TCID50/ml was then calculated using the Spaerman-K\u00e4rber method [78,79].",

Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBS) for 15 min for co-localization analysis of eGFP-tagged proteins with subcellular markers. Primary antibodies were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). NS3 was detected with an in-house created rabbit polyclonal serum, animals were immunized with NS3 expressed and purified from E. coli by Davids Biotechnology, Regensburg, Germany. Antibodies detecting NS4/p20 and NS6 of GII.4 were a generous gift from Stefan Taube [80]. Anti NS5/VPg (strain SAB60) and anti NS7 (NO-strain) sera were raised in rabbits (Eurogentech) based on purified proteins expressed in E. coli. \u03b1NS3MNV PAB was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Ian Goodfellow, Cambridge University, UK, and was obtained by immunization of rabbits with GV MNV and GI sequences [81]. Subcellular compartments and dsRNA were labeled by the following commercially available antibodies: SEC31A/ COPII Vesicles: BD Bioscience / 612351 (Becton Dickinson GmbH, NJ USA); Golgi Apparatus: Anti-Golgin 97 (ab84340, Abcam); autophagosome: p62/ SQSTM1 (M162-3, MBL Life science). Mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Deep Red (M22426) and LDs were stained with HCS LipidTox Red Neutral Lipid Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). ER was stained with a polyclonal anti-PDI antibody (ab31811; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) unless otherwise stated. In case co-staining did not allow the use of this antibody, a mouse monoclonal antibody against Climp-63 (mainly rough ER, ALX-804-604, Enzo) or reticulon 3 (RTN3 sc-374599, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The lysosome was marked with anti LBPA1 antibody (Clone 6C4, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). All primary antibodies were utilized in a 1:50 dilution. Alexa 488 or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) were incubated in 3% BSA for 45 min at RT with a dilution of 1:1000. Nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 min at a dilution of 1:4000 after incubation with secondary antibodies. Cells were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA). Confocal microscopy was conducted on a Leica SP5 AOBS Point Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems). Confocal microscopy was conducted on a Leica SP5 and on Leica SP8 AOBS Point Scanning Confocal Microscopes (Leica Microsystems). Image analysis was performed using the ImageJ software package Fiji (http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji) [82] and the Coloc 2 plugin was used to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient.
