The virus could be propagated on primary human kidney cells and human embryonic lung cells.19 Shortly thereafter, a distinct CoV was isolated using human embryonic tracheal organ cultures, and termed OC43 for organ culture number 43.20 Inoculation of volunteers at the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury, United Kingdom, demonstrated a causal relationship between HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections and common cold symptoms.21\n",

In two thirds of infected patients, disease deteriorates toward an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor alveolar oxygen exchange.44 Symptoms may worsen even further into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a result of progressive pulmonary immune infiltration, formation of hyaline membranes, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and a high viral burden.42, 45, 46 ARDS is the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) and is regarded as the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV infected individuals.47, 48 Lung injury in patients who have SARS is supposed to occur directly, by viral-mediated destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, as well as indirectly, through extensive production of immune mediators.41, 44\n",

            "text": "Shortly after the SARS-CoV outbreak, an unknown respiratory virus was isolated in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in a nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen (sample NL63) from a 7-month-old infant suffering from coryza, bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis, and fever. The infectious agent was identified as a distinct and fourth human member of the Coronaviridae family: HCoV-NL63, using a novel technique to amplify viral genomes without a priori knowledge of their sequence.17 Within a few weeks, a second research group from The Netherlands reported detection of essentially the same virus, initially designated HCoV-NL.16 Because similarity of these isolates is very high at the nucleotide level, they both represent the same species: HCoV-NL63. HCoV-NL63 is demonstrated to be genetically most closely related to HCoV-229E.49 HCoV-NL63 infections are recognized throughout the whole world, and are identified as nonfatal upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised adults.9 In addition, a clear association between HCoV-NL63 infections and trachea inflammation in children (laryngotracheitis or croup) has been demonstrated through population-based studies.50, 51, 52, 53 In patients who have croup, HCoV-NL63 infections are detected as frequently as the parainfluenzaviruses, which initially were considered as the main causative agent for this illness.50 Although an additional fascinating disease association was proposed for HCoV-NL63 and Kawasaki disease (the most common form of childhood vasculitis),54 it could not be confirmed by subsequent investigations.55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 Several current indications strongly suggest that HCoV-NL63, in addition to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, is a common cold-causing virus in healthy adults. Actual evidence for this causal relationship is, unfortunately, still lacking.",

Animal model systems susceptible for HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV have been developed previously, and allow present studies of coronaviral tropism, replication, recombination, and accompanying immune modulatory mechanisms.65, 66 Most recently, a very important technical achievement has been made for studying pathogenic mechanisms of HCoV-NL63, because infectious full-length cDNA clones of the HCoV-NL63 genome can be engineered.67 Nonetheless, thus far, the only option to identify pathogenic potential of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is to determine a significant association with a disease through epidemiologic studies with proper control groups.9 An alternative strategy to gain novel insights in mechanisms of CoV pathogenesis is by extensive characterization of virus\u2013host interactions and host cell invasion strategies.

Following HCoV-229E binding to the target cell, APN molecules aggregate and translocate to caveolin-enriched membrane domains, to activate a specialized endocytic route of virus particle internalization.77 Most importantly, these processes of receptor-mediated endocytosis often involve simultaneous internalization of the cellular entry molecule itself.82, 83 Likewise, sequestration of porcine APN molecules into intracellular vesicles has been visualized during endocytosis of CoV strain porcine-transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).84 Thus, HCoV-229E-induced abrogation of APN expression is highly plausible to occur, although direct evidence is unavailable. Viral targeting of APN and its subsequent down-regulation is definitely a known phenomenon, as this cellular peptidase possibly is implicated in infection with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) also.85, 86, 87 Notwithstanding the fact that human APN is most likely not the primary receptor of the virus,88 CMV induces abrogation of APN expression.85, 86\n",

Internalization of CD4 after HIV-gp120 binding, for example, leads to specific impairment of immune cell functions.96 Moreover, MV hemagglutinin (HA)-induced CD46 receptor abrogation induces serious dysregulation of complement pathways and mechanisms of immunosuppression.97, 98\n",

Besides their classification as zinc-dependent peptidases, APN and ACE2 share important functional enzymatic characteristics. Both proteins are integral components of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS). This endocrine system is one of the most important regulators of human physiology, with a key role in maintenance of arterial pressure, fluid hemostatis, salt balances, cardiac function, cell proliferation and hypertrophy, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Therefore, impaired expression of APN and ACE2 also might alter crucial normal physiologic functionalities of the RAS. Most intriguingly, suppression of ACE2 protein expression during SARS-CoV infection actually causes severe imbalances within the enzymatic RAS cascade, which is proposed to be the main cause of severe acute pneumonia and acute lung failure observed during SARS-CoV infection.71, 76, 99 These findings raise the possibility that CoV-induced dysregulation of the RAS might be important for the clinical outcome of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 infections also.",
