A cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. After a few days, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia [ 1\n]. Although the virus has lower fatality, it spreads faster than its ancestors. It is widely believed that the virus originated in bats then transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals [ 2\n]. The World Health Organization (WHO) named this infected disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 disease has raised widespread public health concerns around the world [ 3\n- 5\n]. COVID-19 is caused by a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. By affecting the lower respiratory tract, this virus manifests as pneumonia in humans [ 6\n]. Studying the initial transmission dynamics of the infection and assessment of the efficiency of control measures can be a crucial step in the evaluation of the likelihood of a sustained transmission to new areas [ 7\n]. On March 11, 2020, speaking at the COVID-19 media briefing, the WHO Director-General stated \u201cwe are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic\u201d [ 8\n]. Symptoms of the disease sometimes referred to as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), are nonspecific ranging from completely asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death. Among COVID-19 patients, approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients showed mild to moderate disease. ",

As shown in the Figure 2, using antiviral drugs, the two phenomena\nof selective pressure and directed evolution can shift the population of viruses to extremely resistant ones. Given this\nconsideration, based on a bell-shaped pattern, different COVID-19 viruses show levels of sensitivity from extremely sensitive\nto extremely resistant. However, when we expose these viruses to a deleterious agent (antiviral drugs, UV, heat, etc.),\nthe sensitive (S), and moderately sensitive (I) viruses become inactive (elimination by directed evolution) and active resistant\n(R) viruses can proliferate and transmit the disease to others. By continuing this process for a large group of people,\nresistant virus gradually becomes Very Resistant (VR) or even Extremely Resistant (ER). Given this consideration,\nhealth care providers can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus forms to more drug-resistant virus types.\nIt is worth noting that new studies show that commonly used antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors\n(oseltamivir, paramivir, zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin are not valid for 2019-nCoV [ 9\n]. Some evidence shows that remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-\u03b2, convalescent\nplasma, and monoclonal antibodies are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV. However, their efficacy and safety for treatment\nof 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients should be further evaluated by future clinical trials [ 9\n]. Given these considerations, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a disaster.",

Mortazavi and his colleagues have been conducting researches on the biological effects of low-doses of ionizing radiation and the health effects of living in areas with high levels of natural radiation since 2002, resulting in the publication of more than 100 articles in internationally accredited journals. Some of these studies have revealed that human exposure to Low Dose Radiation (LDR) can lead to beneficial or stimulatory biological effects, possibly through stimulating the immune system, despite high doses certainly weaken the immune system [ 10\n, 11\n]. Indeed LDR potentiate the fundamental anti-viral immune parameters including natural killer cell activity and interferon production [ 12\n]. An accumulating body of evidence supports the concept of LDR-induced immune system enhancement. ",

Elevated levels of numerous proinflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2) and proinflammatory chemokines (such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10) were detected in patients with severe COVID-19 [ 13\n, 14\n]. This phenomenon is called cytokine storm that can promote viral replication and enhance inflammatory-mediated lung damage which lead to other complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonitis, shock, respiratory failure, organ failure and possibly death [ 13\n]. Cytokine storm, is a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of great amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which acts as a major etiologic factor for ARDS development [ 13\n, 14\n]. The lymphopenia and the reduced number of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients were also reported [ 13\n, 14\n]. It has been concluded that similar to SARS and MERS, lymphopenia and cytokine storm may have a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [ 13\n]. The modulatory effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on the production of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also demonstrated [ 15\n, 16\n]. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent lymphopenia, prevent the decrease in the number of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells using suitable doses of LDR. Although, radiation using appropriate doses may modulate two major damaging factors (lymphopenia and cytokine storm) in COVID-19, the standardization of the radiation concerning doses, timing and duration need to be clarified in more experiments.",
