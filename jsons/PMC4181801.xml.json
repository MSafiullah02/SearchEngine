Throughout the winter season, many children are hospitalized due to respiratory infections, primarily caused by influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumo virus (hMPV).1 The influenza virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that contains eight gene segments encoding 12 proteins.2 It causes a clinically distinct, systemic illness, typically characterized by abrupt-onset fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Similar clinical characteristics have been detected following hMPV infections.3,4 hMPV has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, containing eight genes, encoding nine different proteins.5 RSV has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, encoding 10 subgenomic mRNAs, which are translated into 11 known proteins,6 and is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants up to 1 year of age.4 In contrast to the aforementioned viruses, adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that contain 12 viral proteins.7 Adenovirus infections are observed throughout the year and are considered one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infections.4",

For the RNA rRT-PCR assays, the Ambion Ag-Path master mix (Life Technologies, USA) was used, while ABgene Absolute Blue (Thermo, UK) was used for the DNA assays. The tests were performed using multiplex reactions, which involves simultaneous amplification of more than one target sequence in a single reaction.

The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared in Israel and around the world in 2009, and therefore from 2009, we also assayed for the presence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Other common respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and coronaviruses were not investigated, because they are not routinely tested in our hospital. Significant changes were noted following the appearance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Table1). A minimal number of patients were hospitalized due to influenza A and B virus infections in 2009\u20132010 (P < 0\u00b70001, compared with the other years, chi-square test). In contrast, the percentages of patients infected with hMPV and with adenovirus were significantly increased during 2009\u20132010 (P < 0\u00b704 and P < 0\u00b701, respectively), concomitant with the appearance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and returned to their usual incidence rates in the following seasons (Table1). In addition, the percentage of patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses declined sharply in the year that A(HIN1)pdm09 first appeared (Table1). However, in subsequent years, seasonal influenza infections with Flu A and Flu B were observed at normal rates. The number of patients hospitalized due to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection gradually declined with time; in 2011\u20132012 only a few percent (0\u00b77%) of patients were hospitalized due to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-associated respiratory infections (P < 0\u00b70001) (Table1).",

Interestingly, following the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, which was first noticed in week 18 of 2009, the timing of infection with other respiratory viruses changed. In the winter of 2009\u20132010, RSV infections were noticed later than usual, peaking only at week 4, with the decline of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Figure1). In addition, the hMPV infection peak was detected only following the decline of the RSV infection and the disappearance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, in week 7. In contrast, in the winter of 2010\u20132011, the hMPV infection peak was observed again in week 14 (Figure1), coinciding with the time frame of its appearance in the years preceding 2009 (Figure1). Regarding adenovirus, while infections with all the respiratory viruses were not recorded until the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection declined in week 50 of 2009, the pattern of the non-seasonal adenovirus infections remained stable (Figure1). Continuous adenovirus morbidity was observed from week 49 of 2009 until week 13 of 2010, and another wave of continuous adenovirus infection was recorded from week 17 of 2010 until week 5 of 2011 (Figure1).",

Sporadic cases of influenza infections are also detected even later in the year, between weeks 42 and 50 (Figure2). In 2009, infection with seasonal influenza was detected, as usual, between weeks 1 and 9 (Figure2), immediately prior to the initial detection of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in week 18 of that same year (Figure2). In addition, sporadic seasonal influenza infections were also detected, despite the presence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Figure2). In contrast, in the winter of 2009\u20132010 (weeks 1\u20139 of 2010), infection with influenza (influenza A, B and A(H1N1)pdm09) was hardly detected (Figure2). In the 2010\u20132011, the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was observed between weeks 1 and 8 of 2011, peaking at weeks 3\u20135 (Figure2). Moreover, the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection also demonstrated a biphasic pattern, with two dominating peaks between weeks 22\u201330 of 2009 (Figure2) and weeks 45\u201349 of 2009 (Figure2). This biphasic pattern was no longer observed, since 2009\u20132010, and the virus peak was accompanied by infection with seasonal influenza A and B viruses (Figure2 and Table1).",

In 2009, a biphasic pattern of infection was observed, with peaks of infection during weeks 22\u201330 and weeks 45\u201349. In contrast, in 2010\u20132012, only one peak of infection was detected, during weeks 3\u20135. Biphasic infection patterns observed for the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in 2009 were reported by others 20,21 and were also observed during the 1918 and 1968 pandemics,20 and may correlate with the school year and weather patterns.

These disparities may have evolved from immune protection, which became more accessible between the two infection phases. In 2009, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was new to the population, and therefore, individuals of all age groups were infected; however, in agreement with other reports, the elderly population was less infected with the virus.22 In contrast, by 2010\u20132012, around 50% of the population had already developed immunity against A(H1N1)pdm09.23 During this round of infection, 44% of the patients were children under the age of 10, 58% of which were infants under the age of 1 year, born after the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had already declined. Similar differences in the age groups affected by A(H1N1)pdm09 have been described before.24 We therefore suggest that the changes observed in seasonality and age distribution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection reflects its evolution from a pandemic to a seasonal virus. Indeed, 75% of the hospitalized patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2010\u20132012 suffered from comorbidities, whereas in 2009\u20132010, only 48% of the hospitalized patients had additional diseases. Furthermore, in 2009\u20132010, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the main influenza virus strain circulating in the country, replacing the previous seasonal influenza A, H1N1.",

In the beginning of 2011, the seasonal influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09 infections were noted at the same time, an observation also seen in other countries.25,26 In addition, like in other countries, the only seasonal influenza A observed as the appearance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 was seasonal H3N2, while the seasonal H1N1 has disappeared altogether since then.27 The dominance of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection did not affect co-infection with RSV and adenovirus, which is the most common co-infection.28,29",

The time of the infection with other respiratory viruses changed and hMPV and adenovirus infections were more frequent only after the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had declined. Increased hMPV infection rates were noted in infants <1 year of age. Furthermore, in agreement with other studies,30,31 following the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, RSV infections were detected later than usual. We also observed, as reported in Hong Kong,32 that children between the ages of 1\u20135 years were less frequently infected with RSV B following the decline of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. The reasons for this decline are not completely understood, but can plausibly be due to the generation of a cross-reactive specific and non-specific anti-RSV B immunity following the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Indeed, it has been well established that influenza virus-infected cells produce interferon and other cytokines.32,33 Other studies have suggested that the impact of the A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on RSV immunity may be the result of increased hygienic measures implemented following the pandemic.30,31 Regardless of the reasons accounting for the reduced RSV infection following the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, these results suggest that pandemic influenza infections may provide some minor benefits by reducing infection rates of other viruses.",
