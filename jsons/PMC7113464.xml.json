This has caused serious harm to people\u2019s health and a huge economic burden [1]. As of March 23, 2020, a total of 332,930 patients were confirmed positive of the disease and 14,510 died worldwide [2]. The World Health Organization has increased the assessment of the risk of spread and impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level [3]. COVID-19 is characterized by strong infectivity, rapid spread, and general susceptibility, which brought a great challenge to spine surgery. Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases under the condition of blocking the pandemic transmission is a problem that spine surgeons need to solve. This paper summarized the recent experiences in spine surgery and provided recommendations on how to carry out the standardized diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Spinal patients are more susceptible to COVID-19; hence, screening is of vital importance in outpatient and emergency work in spine surgery during the pandemic. Medical workers should strictly follow standard medical procedures and urge all patients to be screened before treatment. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should first visit the fever clinic, and consultation is conducted by the spine surgeon with completed personal protection.

During hospitalization, a separate ward is provided for every noninfected patient. Chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test should be reexamined 3 days before the operation, and operation can be performed timely after diagnosis is excluded. Spine surgeons should take measures to promote postoperative rehabilitation and reexamine the patients\u2019 chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test 3 days after surgery. The excluded diagnosed patients need to be discharged early after their condition stabilized. If suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are found during hospitalization, the patient should be transferred to the isolation ward for further treatment.",

(2) Prone position is preferred to avoid viral transmission by respiratory droplets. (3) Reduce the use of electrotomes under the principle of ensuring complete hemostasis, and use suction devices with caution to reduce aerosol diffusion. (4) The operation should be gentle and careful to avoid body fluid spatter and sharp instrument injury. (5) During the operation, no one is allowed to enter or leave the operating room except under special circumstances. (6) Operation personnel should be screened for the virus before and after an operation, and anyone with suspicious symptoms should be isolated for medical treatment in time.",

Spine surgeons are facing the dual challenges of spinal disease and COVID-19 during the epidemic. To ensure the safety of patients and health care workers, spine surgeons need to follow standard procedures of diagnosis and treatment. Based on the actual work of spinal outpatient and emergency departments and the suggestions of other orthopedic practitioners, outpatient, and emergency management procedures for patients with spinal diseases during the epidemic of COVID-19 were formulated. We hope to provide a reference for the first-line medical staff in blocking viral transmission and improving treatment of spinal diseases.",
