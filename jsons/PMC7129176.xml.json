Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques were used to identify newer proteins that may provide an insight into the host\u2013pathogen interactions after Salmonella infection and in further colonization of the host leading to the chronic typhoid carrier state. A transcriptomics-based analysis was further conducted to correlate the changes occurring at the mRNA level translated exponentially at the protein level.

The excised spots were incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min with 500 \u03bcl of 100 mM NH4HCO3 and 45 mM DTT, followed by cooling; 500 \u03bcl of 100 mM iodoacetamide was then added and further incubation carried out for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Excised spots were sliced and equilibrated with 500 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated with 500 \u03bcl of 100% acetonitrile for 20 min, and air-dried. Sliced spots were rehydrated in 30 \u03bcl of a solution containing 0.02 \u03bcg/\u03bcl trypsin and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 4 \u00b0C for 60 min. The supernatant was discarded and 30\u201350 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the excised spots; these were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16\u201318 h and the supernatant removed. Twenty-five to fifty microliters of 1% TFA in 60% acetonitrile was added to the pellet and this was sonicated for 10 min. The supernatant was removed following centrifugation at 12000 \u00d7 \ng for 30 s. Both the supernatants were mixed, freeze-dried, and concentrated by centrifugal evaporation to dryness.",

A percentage volume change of spots for the typhoid groups greater than two-fold that of the controls was taken into consideration. The expression of four protein spots was found to be significantly upregulated in chronic typhoid carriers as compared to controls and acute typhoid cases, however very little change was observed between the expression of the four spots in acute typhoid cases as compared to controls. Further, the differences in expression of all four spots showed a significant upregulation in cases of chronic typhoid carriers as compared to acute typhoid cases (Figure 2\n). Mass spectrometric analysis using MALDI-TOF and LC-MS identified these proteins as proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin (Figure 2). MALDI mass spectra and the probability plot corresponding to proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin, provided m/z values for each protein; these were used to search proteins in the available protein database. With regard to the ion score (\u221210*log (p), where p is the probability and the observed match was random), protein scores greater than 33 for proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, and haptoglobin, and greater than 34 for albumin, were considered significant (p\n < 0.05).

The role of haptoglobin as a modulator of inflammation in pathological conditions such as respiratory infections and endotoxic shock is already known.47 Thus, increased levels of haptoglobin during typhoid carriage provide the environment for S. typhi to modulate the release of cytokines during infection and to sustain its survival in the host. The data from the present study clearly indicate the role of the proteins identified in chronic typhoid carriers, which have a potential effect in perturbing the host inflammatory response triggered by S. typhi during its carriage. Further, the role of these proteins in the intracellular cell signaling of monocytes in chronic typhoid carriers needs further investigation in order to understand the mechanism of the host\u2013pathogen interaction and to develop diagnostic kits and therapeutic drug targets.",
