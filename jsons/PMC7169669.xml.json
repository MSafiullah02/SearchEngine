Swine are commonly the carriers of various microorganisms, which do not cause health problems under good husbandry conditions, so that microbiological findings are often difficult to interpret. Persistently infected carrier animals without clinical symptoms are the main cause for disseminating respiratory disease pathogens among individuals and between herds.",

A challenging task for the veterinarian is the early detection of a disturbance in the balance between host immune system, environmental influences and microbial invaders, which is facilitated by the examination of respiratory disease parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Classical microbiological methods or PCR analyses are used to investigate the presence of potential pathogens associated with PRDC in BALF (Palzer et al., 2005). The interpretation of results is often difficult, as pathogenic microorganisms also occur in healthy pigs (Hensel et al., 1994). In swine, the proportion of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) in BALF is significantly increased in pneumonic pigs and correlated to the total cell count. A cut\u2010off of 8% PMNs in BALF has been suggested to differentiate between healthy pigs and pigs with respiratory disorders (Ganter and Hensel, 1997; Mombarg et al., 2002). In contrast to cellular components, soluble disease markers for lung alterations in swine are virtually unavailable. Up to now, most studies are limited to measurements of changes in cytokine levels and acute phase proteins (Van Reeth et al., 2002; Van Gucht et al., 2006). The porcine antibacterial peptide PR\u201039 was found to be increased in BALF after experimental infection with Actinobacillus (A.) pleuropneumoniae, where a concentration of PR\u201039 higher than 1 nM in BALF had been suggested as a cut\u2010off value for individual pigs (Hennig\u2010Pauka et al., 2006). PR\u201039 in BALF as a diagnostic parameter for detecting bacterial respiratory tract disease in general is evaluated in this study where bacteriological findings and the relative number of PMNs were used to define the bacteriological respiratory health status of the pigs.",

Correlations between parameters were examined by calculating Spearman\u2019s Correlation coefficients (r).

In ROC\u2010curves, diagnostic sensitivity (Y\u2010axis) and 100\u2010diagnostic specificity (X\u2010axis) are plotted at different cut\u2010off values, and the applicability of a test system to differentiate between healthy and diseased individuals at different cut\u2010off values can be estimated. In addition, for cut\u2010off values of interest odds ratios for dichotomic variables were calculated. The kappa\u2010index was calculated to determine the extent to which the defined respiratory health status tallies with the respiratory health status predicted (Landis and Koch, 1977).",

In part, serological examinations at farm level had been performed but had not provided satisfactory results (Table 1). The interpretation of serological findings mostly requires additional anamnestic and clinical information as well as the bacteriological or virological examination of samples. Serum titres alone do not prove the causative involvement of a pathogen in a clinical disease problem, as they can be induced by maternally derived antibodies, after recovery from respiratory disease or by endemic latent disease. In general, costs of serological testings are often minimized by examining only a reduced number of animals with the consequence that the information gained in the findings is of limited value. Accurate calculation of an adequate sample size to detect an infected herd (identification of at least one positive reagent) resulted in approximately 30 serum samples per animal group (300\u20133000 pigs) assuming a prevalence of 10% seropositive reagents (Gro\u00dfe Beilage, 2000). Additional serological tests during this study would have given information about the impact of virus infections and bacterial pathogens, which had not been detected by bacteriological examination. A clinical diagnosis for an individual can be confirmed by an increase in antibodies against the aetiological agent during a serological testing of paired serum samples in a 3\u2010 to 4\u2010weeks\u2019 interval (Gro\u00dfe Beilage, 2000). In this study, additional serological testing was not carried out for economic reasons. Serological examination of bacterial pathogens would have been possible for M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae, which are both considered to be obligate pathogenic (Palzer, 2005). A differentiation between M. hyopneumoniae antibodies induced either by infection or by vaccination has not been possible so far (Nathues et al., 2006). Furthermore, serological findings are not appropriate for ascertaining M. hyopneumoniae as the causative agent for respiratory disease in single individuals (Runge et al., 1996). The detection of antibodies against A. pleuropneumoniae is of little diagnostic value in recent outbreaks (Nielsen, 1988). In subclinically infected herds, clinical signs can flare up due to other respiratory infections. Due to the fact that the cultural diagnostic of A. pleuropneumoniae is difficult in samples from subclinically infected pigs, serology provides an important diagnostic tool in these animals.",

The prevalences of positive serological findings, as well as of PCR positive results for PCV2, are also high in pigs with no clinical signs of respiratory disease. Antibody titres had been observed to be similar in pigs in herds with and without post\u2010weaning multi\u2010systemic wasting syndrome (Larochelle et al., 2003).

Because of a low degree of contamination transtracheal BALF turned out to be well suited for a subsequent bacteriological examination (data not shown). In transtracheal BALF high PR\u201039 values were observed (data not shown).

On one hand, these differences might be due to the different bacterial burden and species the animals had been exposed to on their farms. On the other hand, these differences might also be caused by the different lavage methods. With respect to endotracheal and bronchoscopic BALF, results are similar to a previous comparison of endotracheal and bronchoscopic BALF (Delbeck et al., 1997).

The chosen cut\u2010offs for the relative numbers of PMNs or for PR\u201039 are appropriate for identifying pigs subclinically affected by bacterial respiratory pathogens and for pre\u2010selecting pigs for further diagnostics, e.g. multiplex PCR.",

Especially in experimental research the PR\u201039\u2010ELISA is a valuable tool for diagnosing an infection of the respiratory tract. The concentration of PR\u201039 in BALF \u2013 independent of the sampling method \u2013 appears to be a highly reliable surrogate marker for bacterial respiratory disease. If an appropriate test would be available, costs for BALF examination (and for the routine control of respiratory herd health) could be reduced considerably.",
