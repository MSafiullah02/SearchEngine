In the two years after a sexual debut the sexual risk of infection varies from 40 to 80% depending on the studied population and the HPV type [1]. There is a similar incidence of genital condylomatosis in males and females (0-2% and 0-7%) [2\u20134]. In men, compared to women, infections with multiple genotypes and low-oncogenic risk genotypes are more frequent [5]. Only 20-30% of the genital condylomatosis regresses spontaneously. This is a highly infectious disease; about 65% of partners of individuals with genital warts will develop genital condylomatosis. The risk of infection and the risk of progression of HPV-associated lesions are related to several factors including number of sexual partners experienced during the life and early age of the first intercourse; tobacco smoking; and eating habits [6\u20138].",

Purpurea (EP) possess anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory properties. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have been recently conducted in an effort to validate some of the traditional uses of Echinacea extracts [9]. Early studies have shown that only a few Echinacea extracts possess significant antiviral activity. In particular, above-ground portions and roots of EP show a strong antiviral activity, as they have a virucidal effect against influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, and coronaviruses [10, 11]. The EP appeared much less effective against intracellular viruses [12, 13], which could be resistant to the EP inhibitory effect; on the contrary, viral particles located in the extracellular fluids appeared to be vulnerable. Therefore, EP can act during an initial contact with virus, that is, at the beginning of infection and also during the transmission of the virus from the infected cells.",
