            "text": "In recent works, beginning with [Hol15], several stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics (SGFD) models have been derived from variational principles. Such models are obtained using the tools of stochastic calculus to construct semi-martingale driven variational principles [SC20]. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for parametrization schemes (PS) in GFD. Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps. Three constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of these models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough vector fields. The third is the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 formulation in which the variations are constrained. These constrained rough variational principles lead directly to the Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics obtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian variational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin circulation theorem. The rough formulation enhances its stochastic counterpart. For example, the rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we recover the SGFD models in [Hol15] . However, by eliminating the need for stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the Lagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the stochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this property.",

The coming years are likely to see a further increase in the use of SPS in ensemble methods in forecasts and assimilation.

The variations are constrained by the condition of right-invariance of the velocity vector field. Hamilton's principle for fluids is modified when advection by the fluid motion under the action of the diffeomorphisms carries fluid properties such as mass and heat, whose contribution to the thermodynamic equation of state affects the motion [HMR98] . These advected fluid quantities are said to follow Lagrangian trajectories of fluid parcels in the flow. Since the Lagrangian trajectories for Euler's ideal fluid equations are pushed forward by time-dependent diffeomorphic maps, these trajectories may be regarded as curves parametrized by time on the manifold of smooth invertible maps (diffeomorphisms) [EM70] .",

The overall goal of the present paper is to formulate rigorously in Theorems 2.5 and 3.12 variational principles for ideal fluid dynamics with advection of fluid quantities along Geometric Rough Paths (GRP). To achieve this goal, our first aim is to derive a rough version of the Lie chain rule in Theorem 3.3 leading to the GRP version of the classical Reynolds transport formula in Corollary 3.5. The Reynolds transport formula for momentum density encapsulates the force law which governs fluid motion. Mathematically, the formula describes the rate of change of the integral of the fluid momentum density over a moving control volume that is being transported by the rough (fluid) flow along a GRP. Thus, our key result is the Lie chain rule formula (3.4) in Theorem 3.3 for the rough differential (or increment in time) of the pull-back and push-forward of a tensor-field-valued GRP by a rough flow.",

The latter three Appendices provide additional information and motivation for the theory of rough paths. Appendix A defines the notation we use and summarises the essential background and results for both rough paths and geometric mechanics that we use in the text. We choose to put this section in the appendix rather than in the main text since different classes of readers may be familiar with at least some of our notation, and might wish to see the statements of the main results presented first. The main text will refer to sections in Appendix A as needed if we think a notation is not standard. Appendix B contains proofs of selected technical results which facilitate the proofs in the main text. Appendix C illustrates the variational principles we use in the example of a homogeneous incompressible fluid flow perturbed by spatially and temporally smooth noise.

We do not impose that our drift coefficient is Lipschitz in time because it will be the solution of a rough partial differential equation driven by the path Z, and hence it can only be expected to be \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous. We also allow for time dependence in the vector field \u03be since this is used in Section 3.3 to take variations. Claim (iv) is a minor extension of Theorem 16 of [Bai14, BR19] (or Theorem 1.27 of [Dri18] ), which uses the method of approximate flows. We remark that it is certainly possible to weaken the required regularity assumption in space and time of the coefficients. Claim (iv) is the initial-value equation for the inverse flow; it is a transport rough partial differential equation (RPDE) . We understand g to be classical solution in the spatial variable and in the sense of controlled rough paths in time. In [CF09] [Corollary 8], a method of characteristics solution theory for forward RPDEs (in the case u \u2261 0) is established. However, the solutions are only characterized as being a limit point of g n = f (X n t ), where X n is the solution of the time-reversal along a sequence of smooth paths Z n = (Z n , Z n ) converging to Z in the rough path topology. It is not immediately clear that one can deduce a stronger notion of solution (in the sense of controlled rough paths) from this result in a simple manner (see, also, Remark 2.10 of [DFS17] ). The paper [DFS17] and its extension [BDFT20] , also, do not seem to directly state this result.",

The beginning of the section can be read with no knowledge of differential geometry. The rest of the section assumes some basic knowledge of differential geometry (see Section A.2). We also explain the presence of the so-called line-element stretching term in our main equation. The presence of this term distinguishes our equations from a pure transport perturbation of the deterministic Euler equation on flat space in velocity form. In particular, we show that the stretching term arises as a direct consequence of the variational principle and not by how momentum is characterized; that is to say, our variational principle indirectly enforces a covariant formulation, which naturally leads to a Kelvin's circulation theorem, helicity conservation in dimension three, and enstrophy conservation in dimension two.",

By imposing this constraint, the velocity u can be recovered directly from the vorticity\u03c9 = \u2207\u00d7u via the Biot-Savart law. In vorticity form, our equations are a pure transport perturbation of the deterministic Euler equation in dimension two.

Such expansions illustrate that all information of the controls impact on the system is contained in the iterated integrals of the control. The Chen-Fleiss expansion can be obtained directly from (D.2) by formally iterating the integral (Taylor series) with Z = B and and then evaluating at \u03c9. One immediately recognizes the advantage of the Magnus expansion over the Chen-Fleiss series. Namely, the Magnus expansion is an exact solution of an approximating system, while the Chen-Fleiss series is not [Kaw04] .

For example, it is possible to enforce incompressibility via Lagrange multipliers instead of through constraints on spaces as discussed at the beginning of this section and in Section A.2.3. Naturally, additional terms appear on the right-hand-side of the equation for momentum, m, corresponding to the pressure terms (rough and smooth in time). We will explain in the examples in Section 4 how one can impose the incompressibility constraint, either by using Lagrangian multipliers, or by constraining the space of vector fields and its dual. The most commonly solved Euler equation for incompressible homogeneous flow of an ideal fluid with transport-type noise is, in addition, harmonic-free [CFH19, BFM16, BM19, CL19b]. Indeed, in most papers, the authors prove well-posedness of a transport vorticity equation on the torus T d , d = 2, 3 with u recovered via the Biot-Savart law. By the Hodge decomposition theorem (see Section A.2.3), if the underlying equation for the fluid velocity u does not preserve mean-freeness (i.e., harmonic-freeness), then u cannot be recovered directly from the vorticity equation by the Biot-Savart law. As a result of the perturbative nature of our theory, our equations do not, in general, preserve harmonic-freeness at the level of velocity. By imposing constraints on spaces (i.e",

In ideal incompressible fluid dynamics, the fluid flow is obtained as a smooth, time-dependent volume-preserving diffeomorphism \u03b7 : [0, T ] \u00d7 T d \u2192 T d by integrating the velocity vector fiel\u1e0bIn fact, \u03b7 may be regarded as a curve in the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on M, denote by G = Diff dV (T d ) and endowed with some appropriate topology. The Lagrangian, or material, velocity, is the velocity of the particle labeled by X \u2208 T d at time t. The Lagrangian velocity is given by U t (X) =\u03b7 t X = v t (\u03b7 t X); that is, U = v \u2022 \u03b7. The Eulerian velocity, which is the velocity of the particle currently in position x \u2208 T d at time t (i.e., x = x(X, t) = \u03b7 t X), can be expressed aswhere the notation in the right-most expression is the right action (technically the tangent lift of the action) of the inverse map \u03b7 \u22121 t on the tangent vector\u03b7 t \u2208 T \u03b7 t G by the inverse map \u03b7 \u22121 t . The action by the inverse map translates the tangent vector\u03b7 t at \u03b7 t back to the identity g = T id G X R (G) X dV (the space of divergencefree vector fields). It follows that v t =\u03b7 t \u03b7 \u22121 t is invariant under the action of the diffeomorphisms from the right given by \u03b7 t \u2192 \u03b7 t h for any fixed diffeomorphism h \u2208 Diff dV . This symmetry corresponds to the wellknown invariance of the Eulerian fluid velocity vector field v t under relabelling of the Lagrangian coordinates as X \u2192 hX. As discussed in Section 3.2, right-invariance is the key to understanding the Kelvin circulation theorem from the viewpoint of Noether's theorem.Clebsch constrained variational principle.

For arbitrary u : [0, T ] \u2192\u1e8a dV and \u03bb, aThe history of the Clebsch constrained variational principle \u03b4S (u, a, \u03bb) = 0 goes back to [Cle59] , as reviewed for fluid dynamics, e.g., in [Ser59] . The first term in the Clebsch action integrand in (C.2) corresponds to the kinetic energy of the unperturbed velocity u in the decomposition (C.1), not the total velocity, v. The second term indirectly imposes the constraint\u03b7 = v \u2022 \u03b7 through the advection relation. Indeed, the method of characteristics shows for a given a 0 : T d \u2192 R, the path a t = a 0 (\u03b7 \u22121 t ) = \u03b7 t * a 0 (the push-forward of a 0 by \u03b7 t ) satisfies the advection equationTo continue, we consider variations of the formfor arbitrarily given \u03b4u : [0, T ] \u2192\u1e8a dV and \u03b4a, \u03b4\u03bb : [0, T ] \u00d7 T d \u2192 R such that \u03b4u, \u03b4a, \u03b4\u03bb| t=0,T \u2261 0.

Indeed, H. Doss and H. Sussman [Dos77, Sus78] showed 45 that the solution can be defined bywhere exp K k=1 \u03be k Z k t is the flow of the vector field K k=1 \u03be k Z k t with t-fixed at time t = 1 (i.e., the time-one map). This is clearly a continuous function of Z and satisfies the equation exactly if Z is differentiable. In [Sus78] [pg. 21], H. Sussman discussed the connection of pathwise solutions with so-called Wong-Zakai results/anomalies (see, e.g., [Sus91] ) and clearly indicated that: (i) extending this result to K > 1 in the noncommutative case would require substantially new methods; and (ii) finding such an extension would lead to significant progress in our understanding of the anomalies.The key idea for extending the pathwise theory came from T. To describe this idea, let us assume for the moment that third-order brackets vanish (i,e., [\u03be k 1 , [\u03be k 2 , \u03be k 3 ]] = 0 for all k 1 , k 2 , k 3 ) and that Z k t = B k t (\u03c9) is a realization of a K-dimensional Brownian motion. Consider for all (s, t) \u2208 \u2206 2 T , the time-one mapwhere the quantityis the 2\u03b1-H\u00f6lder modification of the Stratonovich integral evaluated at \u03c9 and A lk st (\u03c9) = 1 2 B lk st (\u03c9) \u2212 B kl st (\u03c9) . Then Y t (\u03c9) := \u00b5 0t (\u03c9)Y 0 may is the pathwise solution of the SDE. Thus, the notion of path is enhanced to include the addition of the iterated-integralwhere \u03c9 belongs to a set \u2126 \u2032 \u2208 F of probability one. Of course, we are able to construct a pathwise solution because probability theory (i.e., L 2 (\u2126)-closure) enabled us to construct the iterated integral of the path Z k t = B k t (\u03c9) and the Kolmogorov continuity theorem allowed us to obtain a 2\u03b1-H\u00f6lder version of the iterated integral. Furthermore, the map is stable in the sense that for any {B n (\u03c9)} n\u2208N such that B n (\u03c9) = (B n (\u03c9), B n (\u03c9)) \u2192 B(\u03c9), one has \u00b5 n st (\u03c9) \u2192 \u00b5 st (\u03c9) as n \u2192 \u221e. It is in this sense that the Y t (\u03c9) is a pathwise solution. The reader familiar with Magnus expansions will notice that \u00b5 is essentially the second-order Magnus expansion and the expansion is exact because of the third-order bracket condition.Use of the relation B lkUpon defining for all (s, t) \u2208 \u2206 T and \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 \u2032 , where I K is the K \u00d7 K-identity matrix and \u03c3 2 k (\u03c4) is defined in E.2. Thus, B H lifts to a geometric rough path B H (\u03c9) = (B H (\u03c9), B H (\u03c9)) \u2208 C \u03b1 g,T (R K ), \u03b1 \u2208 ( 1 3 , 1 4H ) for all \u03c9 in a set of probability one. In particular, for H = 1 2 , B := B 1 2 is a standard Brownian motion, B(\u03c9) = (B(\u03c9), B(\u03c9)) \u2208 C \u03b1 g,T (R K ), \u03b1 \u2208 1 3 , 1 2 , and B st (\u03c9) = t s \u03b4B st 2 \u2297 \u2022dB t 1 (\u03c9), (s, t) \u2208 \u2206 2 T .",
