            "text": "The primary information available from an ecological survey usually consists of a mass of sampling results involving many localities and many species. In order to investigate the interspecific processes which may be involved in controlling the abundance and distribution of the species found, it is useful to be able to group together those species which frequently occurred together in the samples, which were in this sense a nearly constant part of each other's biological environment. The grouping will be most valuable as a classificatory device if it consists of defined units obtained by a procedure which can be repeated. Whatever the method of grouping employed, the sampling procedure is certain to introduce subjective elements; the size of sample, the number and selection of sampling sites and the sampling methods used will always be influenced by the judgment of the person doing the study and they will in turn influence the composition of the groups. If, however, the sampling conditions are explicitly given, the probable extent and character of these influences can be taken into account and a meaning given to the groupings in this context. Some of the methods of grouping which have been suggested will be briefly reviewed (see also Macfadyen, 1954 ) and a new method will be outlined which overcomes some of the difficulties REVIEW oF SoME METHODS OF GROUPING Animals have often been grouped on the basis of vegetation or of various physical or chemical factors in the environment, but many difficulties are involved in vegetational classification or in deciding what is a critical limit in respect to a certain physical or chemical factor. Furthermore, animal groupings do not always conform to vegetation or other factors ; a group may extend over several recognizable vegetation or soil divisions or there may be several distinct assemblages of animal species within an environmental complex which is uniform in many other respects. The characterization of the habitat in which an animal group is often found must include the associated plants and other factors, but it seems better to use the animals as the primary basis for their grouping. Gisin ( 1947 Gisin ( , 1949 Gisin ( , 1951 has suggested a procedure using what he has called \"differential\" species. In the hands of an experienced worker this method can lead to useful groupings, but the choice of the species which will be designated as \"differential\" is so subjective that comparison between groupings by different workers, even if based on the same material, may be impossible. Moreover, using this method groups may be suggested the constituent species of which so seldom occur together that it seems unlikely that they could have any relation to each other. For example, Gisin ( 1947) in his rearrangement of Agrell's ( 1941) Swedish Lapland Collembola suggested four groups. Members of three of these were found together moderately often. The fourth group contained four species, representatives of which were recorded in a total of thirty-one samples ; no sample contained all four, one sample contained three, five samples contained different pairs and twenty-five samples contained only one of the species.",

Perhaps the simplest expressions which might be used for this purpose are those proposed by Jaccard ( 1908) and Sprenson ( 1948) as measures of the similarity between floras. As given, however, neither differentiates between a coefficient based on ten samples and one based on one thousand samples, though the latter would surely be a more reliable estimate. The expressions also fail to take account of changes in the relative number of total occurrences of the two species; as long as the sum of the total occurrences remains constant, the proportions can change without affecting the value of the coefficient.",

            "text": "A method based on correlation between pairs of species is precisely definable but, as Cole ( 1949) has pointed out, product moment correlation cannot be used directly because sampling results for most species are not normally distributed in regard to numbers of individuals per sample; there are qsually a few outsize samples which will have a disproportionate effect on the calculations. Transformation of the data or the use of rank correlation could overcome this difficulty, but any method which involves a measure of abundance may, in certain cases, not lead to the desired results : two species may always occur together and never separately and yet, unless there is a nearly constant relation between the relative numbers of individuals of the two species, a correlation coefficient will indicate no relationship even though they are a constant part of each other's biological environment. For this reason it seems best to base species groupings upon presence and absence alone and to consider abundance relations within such groupings after they have been determined. In his paper, Cole ( 1949) discussed the coefficients of association which had been proposed up to that time and indicated the deficiencies of each. He then proposed a new coefficient using only presence and absence and based on a 2 x 2 con-ti~Ig-ency table for which a Chi-square test of sigmficance can be calculated. A basic assumption of his expression is that all samples taken should be included; i.e., the probabilities of occurrence of the two species being tested for association are assumed to be uniform throughout the area sampled. Under this assumption, the Chi-square indicates the significance of the departure of the observed number of joint occurrences from the number expected on the hypothesis of independent distribution of the two species over all the samples. Although Cole did not use his coefficient for grouping species, it has been so used several times since. The following example shows that it is not a satisfactory criterion for grouping if the groups are to be composed of species which form a nearly constant part of each other's biological environment: Species 1 and 2 show no evidence of association when examined by Cole's method and yet they nearly always occur together-over 80% of the occurrences of each are in company with the other -and should be considered together in any grouping based on this set of samples. On the other hand, species 3 and 4 are significantly associated by Cole's criterion even though their affinity is rather low-less than 40% of the occurrences of each are in company with the other. In general, two species which occur in most of the samples taken will show little or no evidence of association and two species with a low percentage of joint occurrences can show significant evidence of association if they are rare enough or if a large enough number of samples in which they could not occur are included. Bray ( 19S6) has recently noted these difficulties connected with the use of Cole's index and has attempted to overcome them by considering only quadrats within plots in which both species occurred. Macan ( 19S4) using the method without modification found a very large number of positive associations in his analysis of collections of Corixidae, a finding which, as he indicated, was unsatisfactory because the objective analysis produced a less well-defined picture than that which could be obtained from a subjective technique based on a knowledge of habitat features.",

Similar values have been calculated for each tenth value of nA from 20 to 100 using the normal approximation. Both sets are given in Table 1 in the Appendix. These values and intermediate ones which can be estimated by interpolation will make it possible to quickly sort pairs of species into those which certainly show evidence of affinity, those which cer-tainly do not and those which are doubtful and require calculation. When applied to the examples used in the discussion of Cole's coefficient, the index proposed above indicated significant evidence of affinity between species 1 and 2 but none between species 3 and 4. It is, therefore, a better index of the pro-portion of occurrences which are joint occurrences and should provide a more satisfactory basis for grouping. It may be repeated that Cole did not develop his index as a basis for grouping and that the two indices measure different things: Cole's index measures the departure of the two species from independence of distribution on the assumption that the probability of occurrence of each is constant over all the samples taken ; the index proposed in this paper provides an objective measure for the word \"frequently\" in the statement \"these species frequently occurred together.\"",

For groups containing only a few species, selection can be based on the requirement that all species in the group are present in the sample. For groups containing many species, this may too greatly reduce the number of samples and some compromise must be accepted. The requirement should be set at a high percentage present but the exact value to be used will depend on the sampling results which are available. It should be explicitly stated in any case. Table III presents some sampling results, related to actual observations but somewhat modified in order to show the different results which DoMINANcE Numerical dominance is often expressed as a mean percentage of total individuals, obtained from the summed percentages of the samples considered separately. Such an expression, using percentages calculated for samples with different total numbers of individuals, is hard to interpret and gives no information about the constancy of the relation. The difficulties of interpretation are increased if the species are dissimilar in size, activity, etc. It is, therefore, suggested that determinations of dominance be restricted to species within recurrent groups which are, or appear to be, similar in regard to size, activity, food requirements, etc. and that the determination be based on ranks within samples, summed over the set of samples. This is equivalent to n things (species) ranked m times (number of samples in the set). The concordance among the rankings can be tested by the statistic W (Kendall 1955, pp. 94-102) , which can range from 0 to 1 ; from no agreement to perfect agreement among the rankings. Details of the calculation of W and of an F-test of its significance are given in the Appendix.

Because of the possibility of parent correlations, nonsense correlations, etc., the interpretation of correlation analysis must always be viewed with reservations. If, however, correlation coefficients are calculated only for those pairs of species for which there are other reasons for expecting interrelationships, they may serve as useful guides to the mature and constancy of the relations. Kendall's (1955, pp. 34-8, 55) The nearly significant positive correlation between the two species of poduromorph Collembola, AC, might be due to chance, might indicate that the species have a favourable effect on each other, or might result from their liking the same conditions and not interfering. The significant positive correlation shown by the presumed prey-predator pair, CJ, indicates that the predator did tend to congregate in those places where its prey was abundant. The absence of significant negative correlation between similar species means that in none of the pairs of species was an increase in the number of individuals of one always accompanied by a proportionate decrease in the number of individuals of the other. More evidence than the presence or absence of correlation is necessary before biological relationships can be claimed, but such an analysis will suggest those which might best repay further investigation.",
