Contact\u2010tracing activities allow for the detection of confirmed cases with a broader spectrum of illness. For infectious diseases caused by viruses, confirmed cases include only those with a positive PCR test result for viral genetic material, in accordance with the laboratory guidelines. Since the first case report of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) in September 2012 1, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Ministry of Health (KSA\u2010MoH) has been working closely with international collaborators and the WHO to better understand and define the epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory features of the new disease. A molecular real\u2010time PCR diagnostic test was rapidly developed after the first case, and was subsequently the method recommended by the WHO for detecting the presence of the MERS\u2010CoV infection 2, 3. This test was used in a retrospective analysis on biobanked samples to confirm two cases of MERS from an earlier outbreak of respiratory infection in Jordan in April, 2012 4.",

            "text": "Important steps for the surveillance and control of MERS\u2010CoV infection are the early detection and isolation of patients with active MERS\u2010CoV disease, and screening of their contacts. Surveillance studies also help in defining and monitoring transmission rates, case load, and epidemic risk assessment, and assist in instituting infection control measures with new diagnostic methods and treatments. Although MERS\u2010CoV case detection is critically dependent on the degree of awareness of the attending physician, accurate laboratory testing is also essential in making a diagnosis. Soon after the detection of the first case of MERS in Jeddah in September 2012 1, the KSA\u2010MoH put in place a proactive surveillance and screening programme for inpatients admitted with respiratory illness suspected of being caused by MERS\u2010CoV. It also included active screening of contacts of confirmed MERS cases. KSA\u2010MoH recommendations for MERS\u2010CoV screening are based on the WHO guidelines on case definition, detection, and contact investigations 5, 6, 7. This led to an increase in the numbers of requests for MERS\u2010CoV screening from hospitals throughout the KSA. We report these laboratory data on the use of real\u2010time PCR tests on clinical samples received from 5065 individuals screened for MERS\u2010CoV during a 12\u2010month period, commencing from the first case detection in September 2012.",

Screening for MERS\u2010CoV is also recommended for family and healthcare worker (HCW) contacts of proven cases of MERS\u2010CoV infection. All samples are transported to and are processed by the KSA\u2010MoH virology laboratory in Jeddah, which is accredited and regulated by the Central Board for Accreditation of Health Care Institute.

The real\u2010time PCR MERS\u2010CoV diagnostic test has been in use for detecting new MERS cases in hospitalized patients, and for screening of HCW and family contacts of confirmed MERS cases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Six months after MERS\u2010CoV was discovered, at the end of March 2013, there were only 17 MERS\u2010CoV cases reported globally, nine of which were from the KSA 12. In light of the infrequent, but continuing, detection of sporadic MERS\u2010CoV cases in the community and the hospital outbreak at Al\u2010Hasa 10, the WHO constituted an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise the Director\u2010General on the status of the MERS\u2010CoV situation 13. The important issue at that time was whether MERS\u2010CoV was going to progress to cause a major pandemic, as did the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, which was also caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS\u2010CoV 14.",

The positivity rate of MERS\u2010CoV by PCR was only 1.12% of all tested HCWs. Transmission within healthcare settings was retrospectively reported from Jordan 4, and then subsequently reported in France, the KSA, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, and included HCWs treating MERS\u2010CoV patients 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

In the UK family cluster, among 33 close contacts (20 household and 13 non\u2010household), there were only two cases (6% attack rate) of confirmed MERS\u2010CoV infection, one with mild illness and one with severe illness 15.

Our data indicate that MERS\u2010CoV affects both genders, and, although a few cases of MERS\u2010CoV in children have been detected, it remains mainly a disease of adults across all age groups. To date, there is still no evidence of sustained community transmission. Despite extensive investigation and testing of thousands of contacts by the KSA\u2010MoH, only a few instances of transmission to HCWs or family contacts have been identified. Almost all patients who died or who had been hospitalized had severe disease or other comorbidities 9, 10. The mortality rate and severity of disease are exaggerated to some degree by the detection of such cases. The case\u2010fatality rate has fallen in recent months, owing to the detection of milder and asymptomatic cases 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. The most critical characteristic of pandemic MERS\u2010CoV strains would be progression to efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. The number of sporadic MERS cases being reported has been small, and indicates that the virus appears to be not readily capable of rapid human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. Two million pilgrims from over 180 countries, and 1 million local KSA pilgrims, have very recently visited Makkah and Madinah, KSA to perform the 2013 annual Hajj pilgrimage, and have returned home after stays of between 2 and 8 weeks 28. Millions of others will visit the KSA throughout the year for the mini\u2010pilgrimage UMRAH, and although MERS\u2010CoV infection rates in the KSA remain at steady, low levels, and no significant increase in the incidence of MERS\u2010CoV infection over time is occurring, pro\u2010active surveillance for MERS\u2010CoV in newly diagnosed patients and their contacts will continue. The availability of more rapid and accurate serological tests will help to better define the community prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV.",
