As a part of these investigations several of these proteins have had their three-dimensional structures determined by either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic or X-ray crystallographic methods. This structural information has provided an excellent basis for structure-assisted inhibitor design using computational chemistry methods. This chapter describes some of the most significant developments in the field of structure-based investigations of viral surface-resident carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus and parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented.",

Animal host cell surfaces are highly decorated by a range of glycan structures that are made up of both charged and neutral carbohydrates (Gagneux and Varki, 1999). These carbohydrates are involved in a range of different functions, including cell protection, a host of recognition events and cell\u2013cell communication (Gagneux and Varki, 1999). As a consequence of this elaborate host cell surface carbohydrate display, viruses have had to develop a variety of strategies that can deal with this protective barrier to enable successful viral propagation. In fact, many viruses actively use these carbohydrates in the recognition and invasion process of their life cycle. Understanding the structure of these viral surface proteins is vital not only to help understand their function but also to enable the design of new drugs capable of mitigating the effects caused during infection.\n",

A change in conformation of the protein is then responsible for the initiation of fusion with the cell membrane. The first structure of influenza virus A HA was published in 1981 (Wilson et al., 1981). Since that time, over 70 structures of various influenza virus HAs have been deposited in the Research Collabatory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). During the 1980s and early 1990s, there were a number of attempts at using the available crystal structures of influenza virus HA to design small molecule HA binders that would hopefully inhibit the replication of influenza virus. A number of excellent reviews have appeared that detail these attempts (Luscher-Mattli, 2000; Matrosovich and Klenk, 2003).",

A recent study by Nandi (2008) described an in silico search of a small subset in the ZINC database (Irwin and Shoichet, 2005) and led to the suggestion of some possible small molecule inhibitors of HA binding, although biological evaluation of these compounds is not yet reported.",

More recently, the crystal structures of HAs from the virus responsible for the 1918\u20131919 pandemic (Gamblin et al., 2004) and from the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strain (Stevens et al., 2006) have been elucidated. Knowledge of these structures has led to a greater understanding of the sialic acid specificity of these strains and it appears as if only a few amino acid mutations are needed to enable the avian influenza virus HA to switch its specificity and recognize human receptors (Stevens et al., 2006; Yamada et al., 2006). Recent reports that influenza virus may recognize receptors other than the accepted \u03b1-(2\u21926)-linked sialic acids observed in the human lower respiratory tract (Rapoport et al., 2006; Nicholls et al., 2007), has inspired studies that may more completely characterize novel asialoglycan recognition by HA. For example, the von Itzstein group described a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based study that enables the interrogation of H5 (from H5N1), as a surface protein of virus-like particles, with novel inhibitors and potential novel glycan structures (Haselhorst et al., 2008).",

In this example, to accommodate the hydrophobic group of oseltamivir carboxylate, glutamic acid residue 276 (Glu276) flips to form an internal interaction with arginine 224 (Arg224) that results in a hydrophobic pocket where, previously, there was a negatively-charged hydrogen bonding group. Such induced-fit phenomena are not easily predicted or indeed adequately handled by theoretical models. Relying on this induced fit, as oseltamivir carboxylate does, also makes it a \u201chot-spot\u201d for the virus to generate mutants that render the drug less able to inhibit the receptor-destroying enzyme function of the NA. This outcome has already been observed in a histidine-tyrosine (His274Tyr) N1 mutant where oseltamivir carboxylate is 265-fold less potent compared to zanamivir which is only a factor of 2 less potent (Collins et al., 2008).",

            "text": "One of the most interesting advances to come from recent NA structure determination and analysis is the existence of two distinct groups of influenza virus NAs, group 1 and 2 (Russell et al., 2006). The main difference between the groups appears to be a very flexible active site loop that includes one of the main catalytic residues, aspartic acid 151 (Asp151). The group 1 NAs consisting of N1, N4, N5 and N8 subtypes have the very flexible 150-loop which opens up a large new pocket in the active site in their uncomplexed form, whereas the group 2 NAs consisting of N2, N3, N6, N7 and N9 show no movement of this 150-loop (Figure 15.4\n). While the current commercially available NA-targeting drugs have all been designed against the group 2 NAs, they generally appear to be equally effective against the group 1 NAs (Govorkova et al., 2001; Mishin et al., 2005), although some strain variability has been observed. A complication with the current avian H5N1 strain (an example of a group 1 NA) induced disease is that in humans it manifests differently to the normally observed human influenza disease resulting in a higher mortality. In fact, the H5N1 strain appears to have more in common with the Spanish flu strain of 1918\u20131919 (H1N1) where healthier individuals appear to be more susceptible than the usual influenza target population of the old, young and immunocompromised. It has been proposed that this is a direct consequence of these pandemic or pandemic-like viruses' ability to cause an immune event referred to as a cytokine storm (Peiris et al., 2007).",

Modelling experiments using a forced glycosidic angle torsion search have helped explain NMR results obtained recently within the von Itzstein group (Mayr et al., 2008) for both HEF and bovine coronavirus esterase. This led to the understanding of the essential pharmacophoric groups required for binding to the receptor-destroying enzyme active site and the knowledge that the aglycon group does not appear to be involved in substrate binding to this site. Similar haemagglutinin esterases (\u224830% homology) have also been identified in corona and toroviruses (de Groot, 2006) and, although these viruses are not closely related to influenza virus C, an understanding of the structure and function of the haemagglutinin esterase will provide more information on the mechanism of cell recognition and entry.",

            "text": "Similar to the HEF of influenza virus C, HN includes both a recognition element for terminal sialic acids as well as a receptor-destroying (sialidase/neuraminidase) function to facilitate virion budding. The first crystal structures of a HN from Newcastle disease virus were published in 2000 (Crennell et al., 2000), showing it to be very similar to the influenza virus NA in its overall shape and active site configuration, however, the active site appeared to be more flexible, probably allowing it to function as both a sialic acid-recognizing lectin and a NA. A more recent Newcastle disease virus HN structure (Zaitsev et al., 2004) has revealed the presence of a second sialic acid binding site which is proposed to be involved in the fusion process but not in the initial recognition of sialic acids. At that time, these Newcastle disease virus HN structures were the only available structures for structure-based drug design of inhibitors against human parainfluenza viruses and led to two reports of designed inhibitors for this enzyme system (Alymova et al., 2004; Tindal et al., 2007). These studies made use of the 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en) template which was also the precursor of the influenza virus NA inhibitor Relenza\u00ae and both also targeted a large cavity around the O-4 binding region of the Neu5Ac2en template. The best of these inhibitors led to micromolar inhibition of the NA function of the most serious of the human parainfluenza viruses (i.e. hPIV-3). A crystal structure has been reported for one of these designed inhibitors (Ryan et al., 2006) in complex with Newcastle disease virus HN and demonstrates that the ligand is bound into the active site in the predicted manner (Figure 15.5\n).",

Both the mosquito and tick-borne virus EGPs share significant sequence and structural homology.

After binding and during the fusion process, the EGP dimers dissociate and reform as trimers; the structures of this trimeric fusion state are also available, i.e. DENV2 (Modis et al., 2004), tick-borne encephalitis virus (Bressanelli et al., 2004) and West Nile virus (Nybakken et al., 2006).",

This information combined with structure-based drug design techniques can then be applied to search for a possible inhibitor of the initial recognition and binding events involved in cellular invasion by these arthropod-borne viruses.

There has been some controversy over the absolute requirement of sialic acid in the initial binding of VP8* of the virus to the cell surface (Delorme et al., 2001; Ciarlet et al., 2002; Isa et al., 2006). Currently, rotavirus strains are classified as either sialidase-sensitive, i.e. they no longer infect sialidase-treated cells inferring a sialic acid dependence of infection, or sialidase-insensitive as they infect cells regardless of sialidase treatment, thereby suggesting sialic acid independence of infection.",

All of the crystal structures of the above VP8* proteins have included the ligand Neu5Ac\u03b12Me (Figure 15.8\n). The binding site shows that the sugar ring is positioned between two tyrosine (Tyr) residues, while the carboxylic acid moiety of the sialic acid forms hydrogen bonds with a serine (Ser) residue and finally an arginine (Arg) residue forms hydrogen bonds to the glycerol side chain of the sialic acid. This sialic acid binding motif is different to that seen in influenza virus haemagglutinin and sialidase, but it has been reported in several sialyl-Lewis X recognizing bacterial toxins (Baker et al., 2007).",

Also, information obtained on the binding epitope of sialic acid disaccharides showed that the penultimate sugar residue does not interact with the protein, but remains predominantly solvated. This is in very good agreement with molecular dynamics calculations that showed that this sugar (galactose) was unable to adopt a conformation where it is in close proximity to the surface (Haselhorst et al., 2007a).\n",

The identification and structural characterization of the proteins and glycans essential in these recognition phenomena opens up new avenues for both drug discovery and vaccine development. While only a limited number of viral surface protein structures have been determined, already structure-based drug design techniques have afforded new classes of drugs. Although significant advances have been made in targeting virus surface glycoproteins for the discovery of drugs, there remains an urgent need for further investigations (Research Focus Box). The science of glycovirology is still in its infancy but shows great promise for the delivery of new weapons against pathogens that have very few drug treatments available.",
