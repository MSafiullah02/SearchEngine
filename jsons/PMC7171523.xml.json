COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the last coronavirus that was discovered. This new virus and this disease were unknown before the outbreak appeared in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 [1]. Coronaviruses, which owe their name to the crown shape of the proteins that coat them, are part of a large family of viruses, some of which infect different animals, others humans. They are likely to cause a wide range of diseases. For humans, these diseases begin with a simple cold to a severe lung infection, responsible for acute respiratory distress [1].",

Two months after its appearance in China, the epidemic seems to have peaked there. In March 2020, the Chinese authorities announced that the number of new cases was declining sharply in the country. However, all the countries of the European Union are now affected by COVID-19 [1], especially Italy, Spain and France. On 16th March 2020, the WHO counted almost as many cases in China as outside of China: 165 515 confirmed cases worldwide, including 81 077 in China and 86 438 outside China (in 143 different countries).

At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilator support when indicated. An array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe [6]. Very recent studies have tested and shown the effectiveness and use of two drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda. WHO includes it on its list of essential medicines, meaning it should be kept affordable and accessible at all times. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 [[7], [8], [9]]. Studies revealed that it has potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [6,10]. According to Colson et al., 2020 the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably the same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of action of these two molecules is identical, and hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for long periods, which would be therefore the first choice in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. For optimal treatment, it may be necessary to administer a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose [8].",

The study demonstrated that chloroquine was very effective in reducing viral replication, with an effective concentration (EC) 90 of 6.90 \u03bcM which can be easily achievable with standard dosage, thanks to its favorable penetration in tissues, including in the lungs [7].

However, the brief study does not quantify this difference in effectiveness. Based on the results of this Chinese clinical study, the Director of the Mediterranean Infection Institute in 3eille, 3eille center of expertise on infectious diseases, assured, Tuesday, 25th February, 2020, to France-Press Agency (FPA) that an ordinary treatment with chloroquine, a drug commonly used against malaria, has shown signs of efficacy against the coronavirus. He considers that the use of chloroquine is a preferred route according to him rather than the search for a vaccine which could not be available anyway for long months. While opinions diverge and critics on the effectiveness of its treatment with chloroquine to treat patients with coronavirus, a second study was published on-line on 27th March, 2020 by the team of researchers from 3eille on 80 patients, aged 18 and 88 and suffering from coronavirus [14]. The objective of this study is to defend chloroquine and to prove the effectiveness of the protocol adopted and the relevance of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. According to this study [14], only one person (86 years old) who received this treatment has died and another is still in serious condition. The remaining 78 patients experienced clinical improvement in their medical condition and left intensive care after five days. The majority (65/80, 81.3%) of the patients had favorable results and were discharged. Only 15% required oxygen therapy [14]. According to the newspaper \u201cCapital\u201d, critics of the study were however formulated by other scientists. Their main critic is that the study does not include a control group in order to make a comparison [15]. The Mediterranean Infection Institute in 3eille published on the same day on 27th March, 2020 a new article demonstrated that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung [16]. Tested in China, and partially in France and the United States, chloroquine, an antimalarial substance, is carefully administered in Switzerland as a treatment against the Covid-19 pandemic. The clinical effect is encouraging since the severity of the disease has decreased in the sample of patients subjected to the pilot experiment. This treatment can be administered to patients who suffer from severe forms of Covid-19, but should not be used for less severe forms, warns Public Health France. France, which has long procrastinated on the use of chloroquine, has just authorized its use on Tuesday, 245th March, 2020 with very restricted conditions. The United States has also approved the use of chloroquine, which has shown very encouraging preliminary results [17]. In Morocco, the technical and scientific committee of the Ministry of Health decided to prescribe chloroquine for all patients, and not only severe cases, with treatment, dosage, monitoring and control procedures to be carried out from 23rd March, 2020 [18].",
