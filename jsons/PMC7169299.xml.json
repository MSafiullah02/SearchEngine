The source of stem cells can be bone marrow (BM), umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) 2. In order to prevent rejection of the new graft and to reduce the number of malignant cells, patients are conditioned before transplantation with either myeloablative, containing high dose cytotoxic drugs with or without whole body irradiation or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 3. Stem cell products used for allogeneic HSCT contain CD34+ hematopoietic cells and a number of additional leucocytes, that is granulocytes, monocytes, T\u2010, B\u2010 and NK\u2010cells 4. The quality of the allogeneic stem cell graft at the time of transplantation is of importance for clinical outcome. It was recently shown, that poor graft viability was related to increased incidence of acute GVHD and transplant related mortality 5, indicating that the stem cell graft composition with respect to antigen specific T\u2010 and B\u2010cells is of importance for immune reconstitution and clinical outcome 6.",

The transplanted graft can induce graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease (GVHD), a potentially life threatening condition where donor T\u2010cells in the graft attack recipient tissues. Recently, graft manipulations before transplantation have been utilized to prevent GVHD, for example through T\u2010 and B\u2010cells depletion from haploidentical stem cell grafts or through depletion of T\u2010cells expressing the T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) \u03b1\u03b2, leaving the TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T\u2010cells in the graft 7, 8. There are conflicting data regarding the benefits of TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T\u2010cells in allogeneic HSCT. Recent studies suggest a favourable clinical outcome for patients with elevated levels of TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T\u2010cells after transplantation 2, 9, 10.",

We analysed the FASCIA results for candida, adenovirus HSV, EBV, CMV or VZV and compared them to the patients\u2019 clinical records 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant. Based on the individual patients\u2019 infectious complications to candida, adenovirus HSV, EBV, CMV or VZV (Table 1, defined in the Material and Method section), the corresponding FASCIA results were divided into two groups, where one group represented patients without the aforementioned infectious complications (NI, n = 9) and the other group represented patients experiencing infectious complications (I, n = 12). When FASCIA data for individual infectious agents were compared between the NI or the I groups, there were no statistically significant differences (not shown). However, a composite analysis, grouping proliferative responses by the FASCIA method against all of the tested antigens, clearly showed a strong correlation between NI status and the presence of proliferative responses in the SCPs against multiple antigens (P\u2010value 0\u00b7007) (Fig. 1b).

Here we evaluated whether antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells in allogeneic stem cell grafts are able to reduce post\u2010transplant infectious complications up to 1 year after transplantation. Cells in stem cell products obtained from donors for allogeneic HSCT were stimulated with antigens associated with infectious complications post\u2010HSCT, that is, CMV, EBV, HSV and VZV, candida and adenovirus. Antigen\u2010specificity function was evaluated by means of T\u2010cell proliferation with a flow cytometry based assay 18, as well as by cytokine production. T\u2010cells from all stem cell products proliferated against the positive control, indicating that the T\u2010cells in the grafts were functional and viable pretransplant. The frequency of cell products with positive T\u2010cell responses to infectious antigens varied. Only about 25% showed a positive response against CMV and HSV, about 33% against VZV, while more than 80% of the stem cell products were positive against EBV. Taking donor age in consideration, these data reflect the seroprevalence in Sweden since the 1960s 22. Moreover, the measured FASCIA T\u2010cell responses against CMV, EBV, HSV and VZV were concurrent with donor serology for the same pathogens. Proliferative responses towards EBV\u2010antigens were detected in the vast majority of EBV sero\u2010positive donors (14/17) (Table 2). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that EBV specific T\u2010cells make up 0\u00b75\u20131\u20135% of circulating T\u2010cells in EBV sero\u2010positive individuals 23, 24. A smaller fraction of CMV, HSV and VZV sero\u2010positive donors showed detectable proliferative T\u2010cell responses likely reflecting a greater inter\u2010individual variability in circulating antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells for these pathogens. Furthermore, among the nine patients with CMV\u2010reactivation at the time of clinical follow\u2010up post\u2010transplant, there were no positive T\u2010cell responses measured by FASCIA against CMV in the corresponding stem cell products (Table 3). These data show an impending role for a pretransplant graft T\u2010cell proliferation assay in providing additional information regarding donor cells\u2019 pathogen\u2010specific immunological competence. Six of the seven CMV sero\u2010positive patients receiving stem cells from CMV sero\u2010negative donors had experienced viral reactivation within 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant. This is in line with previous data showing that CMV seropositivity is an independent risk factor for CMV reactivation 25.",

When T\u2010cell responses to CMV, EBV, HSV and VZV, candida and adenovirus were analysed in composite and compared between these two groups, T\u2010cells from the group that was not associated with infectious complications post\u2010transplant proliferated more and to a wider range compared to T\u2010cells given to patients who experienced infectious complications.

IL\u20101\u03b2 is a \u2018master\u2019 pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine of the IL\u20101 cytokine family. It is important for autophagy and host defence against pathogens, but has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of auto\u2010inflammatory diseases. Binding of IL\u20101\u03b2 to its receptor results in transcription of pro\u2010inflammatory genes and secretion of other IL\u20101 cytokine family members, such as IL\u201018 and IL\u201036 26. Cytokines of the IL\u20101 family induces secretion of IFN\u03b3 by T helper cells 27, 28. Moreover, it was recently shown that T\u2010helper cells induce optimal secretion of IFN\u03b3 through an autocrine IL\u20101\u03b2 activity 29. With respect to our data, this proposes that IL\u20101\u03b2 is also a master regulator for activation and proliferation of protective antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells in an allogeneic transplantation setting. Additionally, allogeneic stimulation per se has been shown to be beneficial in an in vitro study demonstrating that stimulation with viral antigens, binding EBV\u2010 and CMV\u2010 specific T\u2010cells, in combination with allogeneic stimulation increased the number of antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells and their effector function 30.",

Age, malignancy, pre\u2010HSCT treatment, conditioning, GVHD and T\u2010cells depletion strategies all affect T\u2010cell reconstitution and the patient's ability to fight infections 3. Phenotypic analysis of the donor stem cell products by flow cytometry showed that there was no difference in the frequency of granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, T\u2010, NK\u2010, B\u2010cells, CD34+ cells or T\u2010cells expressing CD3+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ or CD3+ TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ between the two groups with or without infectious complications presented here (Fig. 2). Nor did the absolute mononuclear cell dose administered during transplantation differ between groups (Table 1). Yet, increased overall survival has been associated with a higher dose of transferred CD8+ T\u2010cells in stem cell products for allogeneic HSCT. The authors did not evaluate T\u2010cell clonal diversity in the stem cell products 31. In light of the results presented here, perhaps the improved clinical outcome is not due to the T\u2010cell dose per se, but rather an effect of the cell composition in regard to antigen\u2010specificity. It seems that donor grafts with a wider repertoire of antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells against common post\u2010transplant infectious complications with a more pronounced cytokine production can be protective for the patient within 1\u2010year post\u2010transplantation and possibly longer.
