Even in situations regarding their own health, children\u2019s views are rarely sought within healthcare settings (Runeson et al. 2001). Children\u2019s exclusion from these processes is particularly relevant because they are our present and future healthcare consumers (Coyne 2008).",

            "text": "A current and important issue within health\u2010care involves the development of pandemic plans. A pandemic outbreak is a result of an infectious disease that spreads rapidly throughout the world in a short period of time. Pandemics arise from a significant antigenic shift mutating the genetic makeup of a virus, manifesting in infection where immunity may be nonexistent or limited in the population (Schoenbaum 2001, Cinti 2005, AAP 2007). Historically, pandemics wreak social, psychological and economic havoc in a region, often resulting in widespread illness and mortality (Paget & Aguilera 2001, Cox et al. 2003, Anderson & McFarlane 2004, Doyle et al. 2006). Although the expected impact of a pandemic will vary based on geographic location and population, there remains international consensus on the inevitability of a future crisis (Snacken 2002, Cox et al. 2003, Schabas 2003, PHAC 2006). It is estimated that pandemics will cause infection in 25% of the world\u2019s population and will result in 2\u20137.4 million deaths (WHO 2005). For these reasons, it is imperative to redress previous experiences and implement sustainable disaster planning for future pandemics (Couch 1999, Anderson & McFarlane 2004, Cinti 2005, Cox et al. 2003, WHO 2005, PHAC 2006).",

            "text": "A recent international experience involved the pandemic nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and its concentration in healthcare settings which resulted in a unique and profound healthcare crisis in 2003. SARS is an infectious, rare, fatal, rapidly transmittable and progressive respiratory disease (Maunder et al. 2003). There were 8096 probable SARS cases reported worldwide, 774 of which directly resulted in death, with a fatality rate of 9.6% (WHO 2005). Infection control precautions included restricted access to hospitals, limitation of visitors, cancellation of non\u2010urgent surgeries and clinics, infection screening, mandatory protection gear (i.e. masks, gowns, etc.) and often isolation/quarantine.",

Infection control precautions challenged the established norms of paediatric healthcare delivery whereby the family is seen as central to the well\u2010being of the young patient. SARS, therefore, provided a direct affront to the principles of family\u2010centred care which espouse the inclusion of parents and children as important stakeholders in paediatrics.",

Since then, under the guidance of the World Health Organisation, governments, policy\u2010makers and healthcare providers throughout the world have renewed their commitment to address and maintain organisational, regional, national and international preparedness for future public health emergencies (Jennings & Lush 2004, Bruce\u2010Barrett 2006, CPS 2006, Doyle et al. 2006). To ensure the accuracy and validity of pandemic plans, governments and health organisations have turned to stakeholders, namely healthcare professionals and infection control specialists, for input and collaboration while children\u2019s needs and perspectives have been largely excluded (AAP 2005). Although children are often identified as a vulnerable population with unique clinical and psychosocial needs, the discourse on pandemic planning primarily focuses on adult patient populations and the views of healthcare professionals (Wong et al. 2003). Consequently, regional and governmental contingency plans and policies have been criticised for their inattention to the epidemiological and psychosocial specificities of children (CAPHC 2006).",

            "text": "The rationale for including children\u2019s needs and perspectives in pandemic planning is multifaceted. For one, children often respond differently to viruses than adults and this can include both physical symptoms and psychological responses. In the case of SARS, for example, children were not affected to the same degree as adults. Specifically, symptoms used to identify infected adults with SARS were not present in infected children or adolescents (Wong et al. 2003) and adult vaccines and antiviral medications administered to paediatric populations were deemed ineffective (AAP 2005). In addition, infection control practices that were unpleasant for adult patients had a devastating emotional impact on paediatric patients (Koller et al. 2006b). Accordingly, the lessons learned from SARS can inform pandemic plans which more adequately address the unique needs and perspectives of children (2006a, 2006b).",

The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases has proposed that children \u2018are inherently more at\u2010risk for contagious respiratory diseases \u2026 [and] we are behind the curve in finding ways to limit the spread of a pandemic in children even though they are among those most at\u2010risk\u2019 (Trust for America\u2019s Health 2007). Furthermore, \u2018there remains a uniqueness that begs for the care of children to be identified and included in the extensive efforts to explore our nation\u2019s readiness for influenza pandemic\u2019 (AAP 2005, p.1). Notably absent, however, is consultation with the children for whom such policies are intended to serve (CAPHC 2006, AAP 2007, Trust for America\u2019s Health 2007). The purpose of this paper was to present a portion of qualitative data from a programme of research where children and adolescents were asked to share their experiences during the SARS outbreaks and provide recommendations for future pandemic planning. In this paper, the term children will be used to denote children and adolescents.",

These benefits involve personal gains in the form of social and cognitive development as well as contributions to many sectors of society (Youniss et al. 2002).

Participants comprised patients who received hospital treatment during the period of strict infection control practices (7 March 7 to 12 August 2003). Specifically, participants consisted of patients treated for SARS (n = 5), respiratory conditions (n = 8), terminal illness or palliative care (n = 2), and transplantation (n = 6).

For example, opportunities to use visual aids, play with toys and/or view animated picture books of children in hospital, helped to elicit memories and engage young participants during the interview process. These techniques, alongside straightforward questioning, are supported in the literature where such methods not only serve to make interviews fun and interesting for young people but are also useful in generating good and relevant data (Docherty & Sandelowski 1999, Christensen & James 2000, Punch 2002). Accordingly, the interview techniques supported the developmental needs of the participants while ensuring that salient issues associated with an infectious outbreak were explored.

Indeed, these issues emerged during the SARS outbreaks, both in paediatric and adult healthcare settings (Maunder et al. 2003, Koller et al. 2006a). In order to adequately address this recommendation, a review of the curriculum in healthcare education is needed. For example, professional education programmes should provide additional training specific to paediatric healthcare delivery during infectious outbreaks. Such initiatives could attenuate current gaps in knowledge across all healthcare disciplines. Although most medical schools provide training in patient\u2013provider communications (Coyne 2008), it remains necessary to explore these issues on a broader level across healthcare disciplines. In particular, education around how to share information with children of various ages is an important consideration during an infectious outbreak. Interestingly, similar suggestions regarding the need to secure specialised resources on a variety of levels were noted elsewhere in studies with adults who had recently experienced an infectious outbreak (Maunder et al. 2003).",
