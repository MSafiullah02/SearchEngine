(Fig. 1) Twenty-six patients with tracheostomies and twenty-eight patients without tracheostomies were identified. The results of The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition were analyzed for Language and Cognitive development. Demographics were similar between the two cohorts, tracheostomy vs no tracheostomy, with a statistically significant differences in the following: racial distribution, respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA, presence of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) diagnosed by bronchoscopy, length of hospital stay, and age at hospital discharge. (Table 1) For each patient cohort, we analyzed the reported range for both total language development and cognitive development. The motor scale scores of development was also reported although this was not part of the primary outcome of interest. We used the numerical composite scores for each of the main scales of development. Each composite score was then used to determine the equivalent qualitative range of impairment such as profound, severe, moderate, borderline, etc., by using the standard psychometric conversion table. There was no significant difference in language composite score between patients with tracheostomies and those without (trachs mean = 75.19 (SD = 17.30), or median 74 (IQR 59,86) and nontrachs mean = 77.18 (SD = 14.08), or median 79 (IQR 71, 86); p value = 0.645). (Table 2 and Fig. 2) The analysis of cognitive development also showed no significant difference (trachs mean = 80.77 (SD = 12.70), or median 85 (IQR) 75, 90) and nontrachs mean = 79.64 (SD = 11.05) or median 80 (IQR) 75, 85); p value = 0.729).

Since infants in both cohorts were cared for in the same NICU at the time of tracheostomy placement, one can conclude that the decision of whether or not to place a tracheostomy was made by the same physician groups. However, many patients were transferred to our center after hospitalization at outlying level III NICUs, with potentially different management prior to the time of transfer. This may represent a heterogeneous treatment paradigm for these patients, potentially impacting their ultimate need for tracheostomy. All patients identified were followed outpatient by the same institution, and had developmental testing done by two dedicated clinicians, limiting the potential for interpretation bias.",

However, the comparison in this study showed no difference, suggesting that the two cohorts are equivalent. This is a very important observation as there is a growing evidence that suggests that chronic ventilation via a tracheostomy is beneficial to support the growth and development of infants with severe BPD [27]. When chronic respiratory insufficiency limits the BPD infant\u2019s ability to grow and develop, chronic invasive ventilation through a tracheostomy may be a better option to facilitate neurodevelopmental progress and may lead to an improved long-term outcome. Lastly, we were unable to control for intensity of outpatient therapies, which may differ between the two cohorts due to the Infant Home Ventilator program at Children\u2019s Mercy, which provides a robust and structured multidisciplinary approach to therapeutic follow up.",
