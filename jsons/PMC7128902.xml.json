All patients who met the WHO criteria for SARS7 were to be transferred to TTSH for isolation and treatment. In the week before she presented to NUH, our patient visited a friend with hepatitis at TTSH and then travelled to east Malaysia. She had no direct contact with patients with SARS at TTSH and the only SARS affected country she had been to was Singapore. On examination she was febrile to 39\u00b0C, tachypnoeic, tachycardiac, and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography (figure 1A\n). Initial pathology analyses were: a white blood cell count of 19\u00b73 \u00d7 109/L (polymorphs 90%, lymphocyte 4%), haemoglobin 12\u00b75 g/L, platelet count of 149 \u00d7 109/L, urea 7\u00b79 mmol/L, creatinine 257 \u03bcmol/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 2513 IU/L.",

She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where she was intubated and mechanically ventilated. A bronchoalveolar lavage was done on March 26, 2003 and cultures were negative for bacteria, fungi, respiratory viruses, and mycobacteria. Despite inotropic support, haemofiltration, and intense ventilatory support with high frequency oscillatory ventilation, she died 8 days after her admission (figure 1B).",

The intensivist progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and had mechanical ventilation, but survived. The son of our patient was also admitted to TTSH with a diagnosis of SARS. The polytechnic where he was studying was closed for 3 days while contact tracing was done for all students and those with closest contact with him were placed on a restrictive home quarantine order; none had SARS. Careful temperature surveillance and a serological study showed that nobody at the NUH intensive care unit or isolation ward was infected with SARS.10\n",

In our hospital, we found27 that use of the WHO criteria as a clinical screening tool gave a sensitivity of 28%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 11%, and negative predictive value of 99%. Data now emerging on the initial presentations of SARS13, 14, 28 suggest that fever and myalgia are more prominent initial symptoms and that respiratory symptoms manifest only later in the illness. Unfortunately, these symptoms are so non-specific that few hospitals anywhere in the world could afford to isolate all patients with fever and malaise. Consequently, SARS-affected countries such as Singapore had to modify the WHO definitions to suit local conditions; there was a loss in sensitivity as greater specificity was achieved.",

The impact on TTSH and other hospitals was considerable; patients were rapidly discharged from TTSH to clear beds for the admission of patients with suspected SARS, and other hospitals had to carry the load from diverted patients. Unfortunately, many of the patients transferred to other hospitals were incubating the SARS virus through casual contact with patients with SARS in the same ward or in common areas such as radiology suites. These patients went on to start epidemics in four of the other five major public hospitals in Singapore.29 For future outbreaks, we have learnt that all patients in the wards of infected patients are potentially incubating the virus and should be isolated rather than moved to other hospitals. This was practised in September 2003 when an inpatient at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was found to have (a laboratory-associated case of) SARS.30\n",

The intensivist involved in the case described at the start of this article wore full PPE but became infected during a bronchoscopy. It was speculated that the N95 mask fitted the intensivist poorly, and this led to a crusade to test the fit of the mask on all workers, regardless of the paucity of evidence to support fit testing in extensive studies of the prevention of nosocomial tuberculosis.36, 37 In two retrospective studies of SARS in Hong Kong38 and Canada,39 researchers have investigated the use of masks in the protection of healthcare workers.

The use of powered air purifying respirators for all aerosol generating procedures, including bronchoscopy and intubation, was introduced; these were also used in Canadian intensive care units39 and are thought to have been protective. The use of nebulisers was also discouraged and metered dose inhalers (with spacers as appropriate) were more widely used.

He did not meet SARS criteria for transfer to TTSH or for isolation in our hospital.31 Despite treatment for heart failure, he deteriorated and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated; he became the source of infection for an entire shift of nurses and the doctor who had administered high flow oxygen therapy to him while wearing a well-fitting N95 respirator. He was transferred to TTSH when his brother was identified as the source of an even larger cluster of infections at SGH.55 He died of SARS and the infection of several of his work colleagues led to the closure of Singapore's largest wholesale vegetable market and devastation of the local fresh cuisine industry. Home quarantine orders were issued for more than 2000 people working in the market, none of whom were later found to be infected with SARS.",

The virus can be detected by sophisticated laboratory tests50 but only after a period of time,59 during which many people have either been infected or unnecessarily isolated. A broad triage policy can detect most, but not all, patients with SARS during an epidemic31 and any patient that is not identified can start a major epidemic.53, 54 There are some treatment possibilities for SARS and some indications of which patients are likely to spread the disease. PPE is effective most of the time, but some of the time additional protection is needed.6, 39 Importantly, this virus is here to stay and much remains unknown about it. A reliable, rapid, diagnostic test and some rigorous data on control, prevention, and treatment are needed.",
