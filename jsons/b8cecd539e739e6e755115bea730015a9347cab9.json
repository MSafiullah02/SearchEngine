In this paper we present an overview of BigO (http://bigoprogram. eu), a system designed to collect objective behavioral data from children and adolescent populations as well as their environment in order to support public health authorities in formulating effective, context-specific policies and interventions addressing childhood obesity. We present an overview of the data acquisition, indicator extraction, data exploration and analysis components of the BigO system, as well as an account of its preliminary pilot application in 33 schools and 2 clinics in four European countries, involving over 4,200 participants.",

Specifically, BigO provides policy makers the tools to (i) measure the behavior of a sample of the local population (targeting ages 9-18) regarding their physical activity, eating and sleep patterns, (ii) aggregate data at geographical level to avoid revealing any individual information about participants, (iii) quantify the conditions of the local urban environment, (iv) visualize and explore the collected data, (v) perform inferences about the strength of relationships between the environment and obesogenic behaviors and, finally, (vi) predict and monitor the impact of policy interventions addressing childhood The data is processed to extract individual and aggregated behavior and environment indicators. Aggregated indicators are then used through the Public Health Portal, a web application that supports data exploration and visualization and helps analysts make inferences about possible local drivers of obesogenic behaviors, as well as to assess and predict the impact of policy interventions addressing childhood obesity. Other web applications (portals) are also provided. The School portal is used to organize educational activities around obesity at school and to coordinate class or group participation in the data collection. The Clinical portal is used by clinicians to better measure their patients' obesogenic behaviors and provide personalized guidance. Finally, the Community portal provides a summary of data and findings to the public.",

There are three levels of granularity of behavioral indicators, namely (i) base indicators, which describe the behavior of an individual at fine temporal granularity (ii) individual indicators, which aggregate indicators across time to summarize the behavior of an individual and (iii) population indicators, which aggregate the behavior across individuals in a geographical region.
