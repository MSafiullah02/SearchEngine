In fact, why study anything that is not the most highly impactful area? This question demands a definition, what constitutes high impact? I decided to create a definition that impact and threat to life are related. Further, threat to human life is the highest impact and it is likely that things threatening human life may also threaten all life.",

A comprehensive look would seek causes of mass extinctions over the past 3.5 billion years of life on earth. This perspective has been a trending subject in science with focus on five mass extinctions. There are inherent biases in focusing on mass extinctions such as these events fail to appreciate small living things such as single celled organisms or bacteria. Another bias is in order to appreciate life in the past, the life form must occasionally produce a fossil when it dies. Those concerns aside- geologic events have threatened the survival of living things (Table 3.1).",

The lesson remains the same, volcanic eruptions; climate change and asteroid impact threaten life in a highly significant way and are responsible for extensive selection pressure. Unfortunately, these events are unpredictable and so enormous little can be done about them. A mass extinction may not represent a legitimate threat or selection pressure because large numbers of species are completely eradicated leaving few survivors to drive evolution. Finally, outside of removing dinosaurs so that mammals could thrive, what impact did these events have on human life; humans were not yet on the earth when these events took place.",

Most but not all epidemics come from emerging infectious agents, the most significant problem facing life on earth today. The concept of emerging is a human centric term as most of these infections are endemic in an animal host that serves as a viral reservoir. A 2005 report from the University of Edinburgh identified 1407 human pathogens and 177 are emerging or re-emerging of which 75% are zoonotic, that is jump from an animal host to human. Numerous emerging infections caused by viral agents have imposed high impact on human survival (Table 3.3). All the viral agents in Table 3.3 have genomes based on single-strands of RNA except HBV which should focus scientific attention on RNA. There are numerous questions that strike investigators as they ponder a collection of viral agents like those in Table 3.3. The viral polymerase errors in replicating single-stranded RNA genomes are not corrected so the species are constantly changing. The apparent success of these viruses is that as they move from reservoir hosts to humans and as humans become immune to the initial infection, the population of diverse genomes offers multiple chances to adapt by finding a \u201cfit\u201d genome version which can propagate until the next transition requiring adaption.",

These viruses have a single-stranded RNA genome that is converted into DNA, a paradigm shift in the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA. The 36,000,000 human deaths caused by HIV-1 (Table 3.3) is accompanied by a spectrum of clinical signs; eg. fever, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, cytomegalovirus retinitis, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, lymphoma, infection, recurrent pneumonia, and wasting syndrome. HIV-1 genome diversity includes base substitution, insertion, deletion, recombination, and gain or loss of glycosylation sites which all arises from the limited fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase. These mutations are found in clusters or hypervariable regions indicating the fit virus is selected for from vast numbers of less-fit genome sequences. HIV-1 emphasizes key observations: (1) EID is a significant contemporary concern, (2) we are not prepared for the novel characteristics introduced by EID, (3) clinical signs can be diverse and often mimic symptoms of other diseases, and (4) the replication mechanisms are often error prone resulting in an array of fit viruses.",

Infected people develop antibodies that can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in subsequent infections and more severe DHF or DSS outcomes. It appears ADE events occur in people that produce immunoglobins (IgGs) with enhanced affinity to the activating Fc receptor due to the IgG1 subclass and lack of a fucose glycan modification of the IgG (Wang et al. 2017) is the primary vector transmitting dengue but a new vector, , now carries dengue to the southern United States.

Notable arenaviruses are named for the hemorrhagic fever (HF) region of their zoonosis; Bolivian HF is caused by Machupo (MACV), Argentine HF is caused by Junin (JUNV) and Venezuelan HF is caused by Guanarito (GOTV).

Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were injected with 1000 plaque forming units (pfu) of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) Kikwit into their thigh muscle. All of the untreated control monkeys died between days 8 and 10 following viral injection. We measured viral burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) a measure of genome copies per milliliter (copies/mL) of plasma and plaque formation a measure of infectious viruses per mL (pfu/mL) plasma. We found an average of 1.7x108 genome copies per mL on day 8 post infection and 1.2x106 pfu/mL on day 8. Nearly 100 genomes present for each successful virus in a nonhuvwas not observed, the dominant population of viral genome sequence did not change from one individual to another or from one time to another within the same individual. The existence of defective viral genomes may offer potential for rapid change but in a stable host, change was not rapid. When one considers the magnitude of differences in conditions as a virus jumps from a reservoir host to a human, rapid adaptability is a great advantage. A virus that kills all the hosts is not a successful virus. Perhaps defective viral particles facilitate host immune responses giving them a chance to catch up to the rapidly proliferating virus.",

Retrospective analysis of this outbreak linked zoonosis to a culinary trend in which people sought out exotic animals to eat. These nontraditional food animals appeared in street markets in urban areas bringing people close to the reservoir host triggering the outbreak. The civet cat was identified as the source of the first human cases but this is not the natural host. The natural host is the fruit bat, which infects a variety of small mammals including the civet cat. A point of intervention has been removal of the civet cat from markets but the natural bat host remains in the environment maintaining the virus for the next outbreak.",

In one, CMV infections were detected in 14.5 percent of coronary artery samples from bypass operations compared to 4 percent in of patients who needed cardiac surgery for reasons other than atherosclerosis Hebar et al. 2015). In the other, CMV reactivation (viremia) was detected in 16.5% of immunocompetent patients admitted for major heart surgery (Roa et al. 2015).

I had just joined AVI BioPharma as the head of their research and development program. Al was a veterinarian and professor and had devoted his career to the family of viruses dating back to his time in the naval research station in California. He had isolated the nonhuman vesivirus group of caliciviruses not only from suffering sea lions in the Channel Islands, but from reptiles in the San Diego zoo and whales held in captivity. Al and his capable technician, Doug Skilling successfully propagated the virus isolates in cell culture, an accomplishment not shared by other laboratories at the time. Al developed nucleic acid probes and induced antibodies to these viral isolates. Over decades of research he assembled an extensive collection of vesiviruses which were held in redundant \u221270\u00b0 freezers. His singular vesivirus focus gave the appearance of a zealot but his ability to cultivate viral isolates, his extensive collection of isolates, and his one of a kind detection reagents made him a one of a kind virologist. Al was well beyond retirement age and was an \u201cold school\u201d virologist ready at a moment\u2019s notice to take his bag into the real world and collect swabs from ailing animals. He maintained careful records of the condition of his patients, their location, and the setting of the animal in the community. Every field trip led to work in the lab propagating virus from his swabs.",

This advantage is superimposed on the theoretical advantages of selectivity, specificity and affinity provided by Watson-Crick base pairing. RNA-based therapeutics are expected to provide a substantially more narrow range of pharmacokinetic properties and toxicities thus are easier to compare to each other and ultimately combine into multi-agent cocktails. However, the mechanism of action may vary from RNAse H or RISC mediated degradation of the targeted RNA or steric inhibition of RNA function. The objectives of our antiviral program have been to exploit the broad understanding of RNA-based therapeutics for antiviral activity with a common chemical type, the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oliogmer (PMO) and their enhanced derivatives. In this way the mechanism of action is common to all agents, which is steric blockade of RNA function.",

The pandemic will be a global event by the time an effective vaccine is available. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors as therapeutic and prophylactic agents in the setting of pandemic influenza A (FLUA) were called in to doubt in the past decade (Michiels et al. 2013; Jefferson et al. 2014). Indeed, 100% of isolates in the 2008/2009 A/H1N1 pandemic were found to be resistant to adamantanes, and resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu; OSL) was observed in virus recovered from individuals taking OSL therapeutically or prophylactically (Dharan et al. 2008; CDC MMWR 2009), while effect on duration of shedding was not impacted. A recent outbreak of an influenza A (H7N9) virus caused 137 cases and 45 deaths in China revealed a novel NA mutation R292K resulting in high level resistance to OSL (Wang et al. 2014). Therapeutic options for treatment of individuals with complicated influenza A are severely limited, perhaps no options. Pandemic strains such as A/H1N1pdm09 carried significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in those who had not experienced H1-strain influenza in their lifetime. We are also witnessing more rapidly emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza strains that are resulting in human infection; some such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 appear to becoming more efficient in person-to-person transmission, and reports suggest OSL resistance develops during treatment (de Jong et al. 2005; Lam et al. 2015). We are not ready for an outbreak of avian flu or any other emerging single-stranded RNA virus. Why not?",

We identified three compounds each with activity and when combined we observed unprecedented efficacy in a lethal challenge primate animal model (Warfield et al. 2006). Hundreds of experiments over the next 3 years optimized these agents (Swenson et al. 2009). We were able to obtain research grants from the Transformational Medical Technologies (TMT) division of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) within the Department of Defense (DOD) and we completed proof of efficacy studies (Warren et al. 2010). This led to submission of an investigational new drug application (IND) to the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and phase I safety and tolerability studies were conducted I healthy human volunteers (Heald et al. 2014). After 11 years of continuous effort, we completed key aspects related to the FDA approval process under the \u201c Animal Rule\u201d and we streamlined our treatment to a single agent, AVI-7537 (Warren et al. 2015). However, shortly before the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, the US government \u201cbudget sequester\u201d cancelled our project and the most advanced therapeutic on the planet was not deployed to treat those infected during the outbreak. As the outbreak continued, we found no viral resistance of AVI-7537 unlike the monoclonal antibody therapy in use (Khiabanian et al. 2014). AVI-7537 sits on a shelf, a political casualty and an unfavorable business model.",

The Earth\u2019s atmosphere transports viruses all over the planet. Viruses are found in soil at 1.5 x 108 to 6.4 x 108 particles per gram of dry soil (Kimura et al. 2008). The surface oceans carry approximately ten million viral particles in each milliliter of seawater, most of which are bacteriophages (phage). The small viral particles are easily carried into the upper atmosphere by up drafting winds. Bacteria are deposited from the atmosphere at a rate of 0.3 to 8 x 107 per meter each day and viral deposition rates are 9\u2013461 times greater (Reche et al. 2018). These phages influence bacterial lifecycles and play a role in natural energy and nutrient cycles fundamental to life on Earth. The dynamics of phage-bacterial evolution drive changes in photosynthesis, phosphate, and nitrogen balance (Breitbart 2012). Human accidental release of radioactive waste (discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_2) and disposal of chemicals including potent antiviral and antibacterial compounds (discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-98164-2_7) may alter the eco-evolutionary dynamics producing unanticipated environmental consequences.",

The focus has been on viral infections because they rely on host ribosomes to produce their proteins, recent emerging infections have been from single-stranded RNA genome viruses, and replication of RNA viruses is error prone. Pandemic infections have accompanied the rise of human civilization frequently re-occurring leaving a lasting imprint on human history punctuated by profound loss of life. Emerging infections become endemic with an annual death toll. Each decade brings a new onslaught of emerging infectious agents. We are surprised again and again but have never prepared for these inevitable catastrophies. The long-term consequences often remain unrecognized and are always inconvenient such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and immune associated diseases that threaten our health. Reliance on clusters of clinical symptoms in the face of diverse and non-descriptive viral infection symptoms is a foolhardy form of crisis management. Infectious disease will certainly continue to pose the most significant threat to human health in the age to cell phones, artificial intelligence, and global commerce.",
