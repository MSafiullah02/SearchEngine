As of today, still only a few months into the pandemic, the disease and public health control measures are having very substantial impact on clinical trials globally. Quarantines, site restrictions, travel restrictions affecting participants and site staff, COVID-19 infections of study participants, and interruptions to the supply chain for study medication have led to operational problems, including difficulties in adhering to study protocols. Trial sponsors have rapidly responded to this crisis, where the overriding primary concern has been to protect participant safety. Some trials have been halted or enrolment suspended in the interest of participant safety. For ongoing trials, sponsors have implemented a variety of mitigations to assure safety of participants and address operational issues.",

Different strategies can be used for interruptions exceeding this duration as opposed to shorter interruptions.

(We note that in the framework of Little and Rubin (2002) , MCAR is defined as independent of any observed or unobserved factors. This definition was subsequently generalized to encompass dependence on prerandomization covariates, also referred to as covariate-dependent missingness, and MCAR is now used in the literature in both cases.) Some types of pandemic-related missingness may be considered MCAR, e.g., if it is due to a site suspending all activities related to clinical trials. Consideration may be given to whether such participants should be excluded from the primary analysis set depending on the amount of data collected prior to or after the pandemic. For example, when all (most) data are missing for some participants, imputing their data based on a model from participants with available data would not add any new information to the inference, while excluding such participants is unlikely to introduce bias.",

Multiple imputation with auxiliary variables may be used for various types of endpoints, including continuous, binary, count, and time-to-event and coupled with various inferential methods in the analysis step.

For non-pandemic-related events and missing data, the originally planned sensitivity analyses should be performed, but simply applying the pre-planned sensitivity analyses to both pandemic and non-pandemic ICEs and missing data may be problematic for three reasons. First, the objective to estimate treatment effects in the absence of a COVID-19 pandemic may mandate different strategies for pandemic-related and unrelated events. Second, as discussed in Section 4.2.2, an MCAR or MAR assumption is frequently plausible for COVID-19-related events whereas this may not be the case for other missing data. Third, sensitivity analyses to missing data could become excessively conservative if the amount of pandemic-related missing data is large.",

These data are incorporated into definitions of pandemic-related ICEs and missing data, and the strategies for handling those in the analysis. Statistical analyses of trial data will then be properly adjusted for pandemic effects. In many ways this is the ideal approach as it incorporates what is known for each participant directly into the analysis, and in a way that is very well understood.

This approach requires the accurate and precise definition of pandemic periods. This is simpler to apply in single-country studies where the impact of the pandemic and local containment measures may be relatively homogeneous across participants. However, even for a single country, the pandemic may evolve in a gradual fashion, complicating the definition of pandemic start and stop dates, and the impact of the pandemic on study participants will likely not be homogenous. Moreover, there may be several waves of infection outbreaks. The definition could prove even more challenging to implement in global trials because the start and stop dates of these periods and the impact of the pandemic on study participants may well vary by region. In practice, a standardized and pragmatic definition based on regionally reported numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time and/or start date and stop dates of local containment measures will likely be required. Once pandemic periods have been defined, time-varying indicator variables for visits occurring during different pandemic periods could be incorporated as appropriate in statistical models or in ICE definitions, as discussed previously.

Sponsors may also consider additional estimands for exploratory purposes to characterize the treatment effect in specific conditions or sub-populations that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.In studies where estimand(s) have been explicitly defined in the original protocol, sponsors should examine the effect of pandemic-related disruptions on estimand attributes and modify them as appropriate. The necessary revisions may vary under different risk mitigation scenarios, such as continuing study enrolment as planned versus temporarily suspending enrolment. For studies without explicitly defined estimands, this section may be useful to guide thinking about pandemic-related impacts on study objectives, conduct, inference, and statistical analyses.Below we review each attribute of the estimand definition and highlight important pandemic-related considerations. In keeping with the ICH E9(R1) guideline, we make a distinction between intercurrent events and missing data handling. Intercurrent events are discussed in this section as one of five attributes used to define an estimand. Missed assessments that would have been meaningful for a given estimand if collected, while the study treatment continues as planned, should not be considered as ICEs. Such situations lead to missing data and should be considered as part of the missing data strategies in the context of an estimator, albeit in alignment with the estimand (see Section 4.2).",
