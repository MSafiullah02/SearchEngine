The dispersion of different human communities around the globe has exposed each population to different infectious agents, exerting a selective pressure (see Glossary) on them; thus, adaptation to the new environment has favored the selection of the most beneficial genetic variants for the host. As a result, infectious agents have caused the expansion of alleles behind the induction of either protection or tolerance to these diseases; heritable variations, that increased the survival to deadly infectious agents, may have been naturally selected before the hosts had the opportunity to reproduce [1]. Natural selection driven by pathogens is probably more remarkable for those infectious agents that have been among us for a longer time, namely the causative agents of well-known diseases such as leprosy, smallpox, malaria, or tuberculosis. The genetic imprint of pathogen-driven selection depends on the length and the virulence of the infections and also the geographical distribution.",

This group includes more than 300 immune-related genes with functional variations between populations, which are probably behind the variability of responses to immune-related diseases reported nowadays [3,4]. Besides natural selection, other evolutionary mechanisms, such as genetic drift, greatly influence the frequencies of the genetic variants found within diverse populations throughout the world [5] (Box 1\nand Figure 1\n).Box 1Transmission of Genetic VariationsThe gene variations that pass from one generation to the next are often transmitted as a random process known as genetic drift, while selection of advantageous variants tends to be preferentially transmitted. Mutations, genetic drift, migration, and environmental selective pressure are among the fundamental processes behind the evolution of humans. The influence of these mechanisms in the diverse communities that were mobilized and then became isolated, as well as severe external factors such as epidemics, caused successive genetic bottlenecks in populations (see Figure 1 in main text) [90]. Human evolutionary studies are currently considered under \u2018modern synthesis\u2019, which merges Darwin's ideas of natural selection with theoretical population genetics and Mendelian principles, stating that evolution occurs via small genetic changes that are regulated by natural selection [91]. These beneficial adaptations subsequently expand within the members of a population and become evident in the ancestral specificity and the geographical distribution of the advantageous alleles in the genomes of contemporary humans.\n",

In this review we offer a novel perspective on the role of infectious diseases as agents of natural selection and as forces behind the evolutionary pressure encountered by human ancestors and modern humans in their migrations around the globe. Specific genetic variants selected throughout different periods of human history may have influenced immune responses of present-day populations against pathogenic microorganisms and may have played a role in the development of certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "Pathogens have played a central role as agents of natural selection from those very early days. Among various infectious diseases, malaria has exerted the highest evolutionary pressure on the communities across the African continent (Figure 2\n) [7]. Populations remaining in sub-Saharan Africa have been exposed to malaria for such long periods of time that their genetic structures have been shaped by the severity of malaria (Plasmodium sp.) infections. In 1954, Allison described that sickle cell disease distribution was confined to Africa and was associated with the geographical presence of malaria [8]. This finding led to the more recent description of the existence of mutations in the Hemoglobin-B (HBB) gene as a result of natural selection driven by evolutionary pressure for protection against malaria [9] (Table 1\n). Similarly to HBB, some areas of West Africa with a high incidence of malaria present a high frequency of Hemoglobin-C (HBC) in their populations, which is associated with a 30\u201393% decrease in the possibility of developing the disease [10]. This is also the case for the Duffy antigen receptor gene (DARC) in erythrocytes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which have been associated with protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria in certain areas of Africa where this disease is endemic [11,12]. Another example of natural selection driven by evolutionary pressure for protection against malaria are thalassemia (\u03b1 and \u03b2) pathologies, a group of hemoglobin disorders that presents an incidence of up to 30% among communities of West Africa [13]. The human CASP12 T125C SNP, expression of which is restricted to the African subcontinent, South America, and certain areas of Asia, can modulate immune and inflammatory responses to malaria by antagonizing interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB signaling in innate immune cells; moreover, caspase 12-deficient mice (Casp12\n\u2013/\u2013) exhibit decreased interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production and clearance of the parasite, relative to wild type (WT) infected mice [14]. However, others have questioned these findings, given that caspase 12-deficient mice also lack caspase 11 expression, so the effects observed might not be specific to caspase 12 [15].",

This long-standing relationship between humans and MTB probably underlies the large variety of immune-related factors that modulate susceptibility to MTB infection, including vitamin D receptor (VDR), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (SLC11A1), TIR Domain Containing Adaptor Protein (TIRAP), HLA, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 [17] (Table 1). Patients with African ancestry present a higher frequency of MTB-related genetic variants than individuals from other populations, including variants in the gene encoding for Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6), mediating cellular responses to bacterial lipoproteins [18,19]. Selective pressure has also shaped the mechanisms that modulate the expression of genes implicated in immune responses against Lassa virus, such as IL-21 (IL21) and the glycosyltransferase-like protein LARGE1 (LARGE), suggesting that the natural selection exerted by the virus drove the expansion of genetic variants that enhance immunity against Lassa fever [20]. These examples indicate that infectious diseases have contributed to shaping the genetic landscape of African populations and their descendants, and highlight the great impact of pathogens as an evolutionary force in humans.",

By interbreeding with archaic humans, modern humans incorporated these advantageous adaptations in the genome of their descendants. This was highlighted by different studies that showed that the introgression of diverse genes related to immune functions, such as the OAS cluster, TLR1, or the histocompatibility complex from Denisovans and Neanderthals shaped the genetic landscape of present-day Eurasian, but not African, communities. Genomic sequences and expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines from 421 individuals of European and African ancestry confirmed that the TLR1\u2013TLR6\u2013TLR10 genetic loci, presenting signs of local positive selection and repeated introgression from both Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes [24, 25, 26], showed a significantly higher expression in individuals carrying archaic-like alleles than in individuals carrying the nonintrogressed modern human alleles [2,26,27]. The expression of these genes has shaped human immune responses against different types of pathogens. For example, the gp41 protein of the HIV-1 virus has been recently recognized as a TLR10 ligand [28]. In this regard, increased TLR10 expression has been correlated with higher IL-8 production by the macrophage cell line THP-1 and higher titers of HIV-1 in the breast milk of HIV-1-infected Nigerian women relative to controls [28]. TLR1 and TLR6 form dimers with TLR2, triggering immune responses against different types of bacteria, fungi, virus, and parasites [29]. Variation in TLR1\u2013TLR6\u2013TLR10 is the major genetic determinant of human interindividual differences in TLR1/2-mediated responses, including cytokine production to a number of clinically relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes [30] (Table 1). This inheritance from archaic humans may have also left some human individuals more prone than others to developing asthma, hay fever, and other allergies (of 58 SNPs associated with susceptibility to allergic disease, 12 had a Neanderthal or Denisovan origin) [26], although these associations remain to be fully demonstrated [31].",

            "text": "The migration of our human ancestors out of Africa implied the exposure to different types of infectious diseases (Box 2\nand Figure 3\n). One study tested the responsiveness of human macrophages to pathogenic bacteria in vitro, finding that almost 10% of the genes present in human macrophages infected with the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium or L. monocytogenes present different regulatory responses directly linked to the lineage of the donors and, also, that macrophages obtained from individuals of African origin display enhanced bactericidal activity compared with those from individuals of European lineage [32]. The trend towards lower inflammatory responses in European populations is strengthened by the fixation of a TLR1 gene variant that results in lower proinflammatory gene expression in populations with a European ancestry compared with those with an African one [33]. The largest population differences in gene expression between Africans and Europeans have been found in the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), a protein implicated in responses against viral infections and TLR-induced dendritic cell activation [34], the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, which mediates effector lymphocyte functions, and also several IFN-stimulated genes [35]. West Eurasian populations present a high frequency of TIRAP Ser180Leu SNPs [36]. TIRAP is an adaptor protein in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways, involved in inflammatory responses and cytokine production. The heterozygous expression of the Ser180Leu SNP is protective against invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis, as shown in a case\u2013control study of 6106 individuals from the UK, Vietnam, and several African countries, and it is associated with lower TLR2 signaling in humans [36]. This variant is considered to be a consequence of the natural selection that may have taken place in an early period following the migration of modern humans out of Africa [37].Box 2Human MigrationOne of the most interesting aspects of humans is their ability to adapt to almost every ecosystem of the planet. The history of mankind is also the history of millions of individuals wandering around the world, looking for a better place to live. A glimpse to the migratory legacy of humanity around the globe reveals the great impact that the massive population movements defined the world as we know it today (see Figure 3 in main text). The distances ancient humans travelled are impressive, from the first hominids colonizing Africa to the conquest of the Americas in a time when the Bering Strait was not yet under water. The historical exodus of mankind started almost 2 million years ago with the migration of Homo erectus from Africa through Eurasia. From this event on, relatively isolated human populations evolved separately on different continents, leading to the emergence of different human species, such as Neanderthals in Europe, the Denisovans in Asia, and, later, modern Homo sapiens in Africa [92,93]. H. sapiens first colonized large areas of the continent around 300 000 years ago [6], spread towards the Middle East at some point between 150 000 and 80 000 years ago, and migrated through Eurasia, reaching Australia within 20 000 years [94]. Asian human ancestors went through the frozen waters of the Bering Strait in two distinct waves to colonize the American continent approximately 20 000 years before the present time [95].",

In line with this, a database meta-analysis showed that individuals expressing the +874T/A variant of IFNG presented higher susceptibility to tuberculosis MTB infection than individuals without it, which might be considered a putative prognostic factor for the development of tuberculosis [40], although this remains to be robustly demonstrated.",

            "text": "The consequences of these pandemics are still visible in current populations; one report studied DNA from the bones of 25 ancient humans from the Tsimshian community, living in the British Columbia region in Canada until the 15th century, identifying marks of positive selection in a number of immune-related variants [43]. Specifically, the HLA-DQA1 variant was present in almost the totality of Tsimshian individuals, but only in one third of present-day humans studied; this suggested that ancient American genomes were evolutionarily selected to respond to local diseases but not to fight against pathogens brought by the Europeans [43]. Another study compiled information on infectious diseases that have killed more than 10 000 individuals among 59 indigenous communities of the Amazonia in the past two centuries, showing that the mortality rates and the incidence of infectious diseases rapidly decayed within the time following the first encounter with the pathogen, compatible with genetic adaptation [44]. European colonizers underwent purifying selection in situations of intense pressure. Such scenarios were documented when Dutch colonists migrated to Surinam and encountered epidemics of yellow and typhoid fever that caused a 60% mortality rate among settlers [45]. Variations in the frequencies of C3, GLO, and HLA-B genes among the descendants were not likely caused by genetic drift, but rather, it has been proposed that these populations were probably selected through genetic control of survival to the epidemics [45] (Box 3\n).Box 3The Case of Resistance Variants against HIV-1 InfectionThe origins of the HIV virus are still a matter of scientific discussion. The most accepted scenario argues that HIV originated in simians and was transmitted to humans in West Africa in the 1920s, likely due to local ingestion of ape meat infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus. Around 1960, the virus reached wide parts of the continent and finally spread overseas thanks to a group of Haitian professors coming back from Africa. In the following decades, the virus spread worldwide and generated the pandemic we now know. Today, there are approximately 37 million people worldwide living with HIV-1/AIDS [110]. CCR5 is a receptor of chemokines that plays a fundamental role in HIV-1 pathogenesis and it is also one of the most promising targets to restrict the infection, since mutations in this receptor turn individuals resistant [96]. The CCR5-\u039432 mutation results in a deletion that eliminates the HIV-1 co-receptor on lymphocytes, providing robust protection against HIV-1 and, therefore, AIDS [97]. CCR5-\u039432 allele frequencies reach 14% in northern Europe populations, whereas it is not present in populations with different ancestry, such as East Asian, native American, or African groups [96]. This regional distribution of CCR5-\u039432 variants is most likely related to a naturally selective episode that struck European populations around 700 years ago and involved a strong infectious agent that also employed CCR5 [98]. A mathematical model studying the changes in the European populations in the Middle Ages suggested Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague) as the most probable infectious agent behind the pressure that selected this particular genetic variant [99]. This is in agreement with the finding that European Rroma populations, but not Northwestern Indian populations that inhabit the area where the Rroma originally lived, present signatures of positive selection in TLR1\u2013TLR6\u2013TLR10, which influence cytokine responses in Y. pestis infections [100].",

The degree of African ancestry, analyzed by fine-mapping analysis refined to the Duffy-null allele of rs2814778, was correlated with an increased amount of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL2 and CCL11 in plasma relative to controls [12]. A study involving 12 000 African American and Hispanic American women found that the higher values of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood found in these populations compared with European Americans were related to a CRP-associated variant of triggering receptors expressed by myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) [47]. Moreover, comparison of health record data from individuals with connective tissue diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease from almost 300 000 African American and European American adults was conducted; the study reported for the latter, a prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 29.7% African Americans (particularly high in young individuals), relative to 14.7% in European Americans [48]. These studies highlight certain genetic links to inflammatory predisposition/manifestation. However, increased proinflammatory activity is a double-edged sword. In the absence of regular pathogen challenges that require maintained modulation of the balance between inflammation and suppression of the immune response, the organism can overreact to inflammatory stimuli and trigger exacerbated responses. For instance, descendants of African populations generally present higher susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune syndromes such as inflammation-associated carcinomas, lupus, asthma, and multiple sclerosis (MS), the overall prevalence of which is up to three times higher in individuals with African ancestry relative to individuals with European ancestry [31,49,50].",

The microbiome has its own evolutionary scenario across different populations with divergent lifestyles, nutrition, and exposure to environmental agents, generating extraordinary heterogeneity. The ongoing process of \u2018lifestyle Westernization\u2019 of different societies has an important impact on the mutualistic relationships between humans and commensal organisms worldwide. African tribes are adopting Western subsistence patterns, leading to remarkable changes in the composition of their microbiota [52]. The comparison of the intestinal flora of the BaAka hunter-gatherers and the Bantu agriculturalists (both from the Central Africa Republic), with a group of US-born African Americans showed a great example of the evolution of the human microbiome [52]. Specifically, the Bantu, still engaged in hunting, have a greater bacterial gut diversity than their BaAka neighbors, who left the jungle for agriculture, and even more than urbanized westerners (US African-Americans) [52]. This reduced microbiota diversity in Western societies has been associated with a higher incidence of the so-called \u2018diseases of civilization\u2019 such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune disorders, which are very unusual in hunter-gatherer societies compared with communities living a Western-type lifestyle [52,53].",

Approximately 8% of the human genome is composed of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), sequences derived from past retroviral infections and permanently inserted into different regions of the human genome [56]. One study showed that ERVs played a central role in the induction of IFN-dependent immune responses and that the removal of one or more of these viral DNA elements in the HeLa human cell line severely impaired the recruitment of transcription factors necessary to trigger the expression of IFNG against vaccinia virus infection relative to controls [57]. Viruses can also influence the severity of infections caused by other viruses. For example, cytomegalovirus infection in HIV-1 seropositive humans can potentiate the effects of HIV-1 infection by expanding the pool of circulating regulatory T cells (immunosuppressive); these were shown to inhibit the proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in response to cytomegalovirus infection in vitro [58]. In one study, patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatitis A virus (HAV) superinfection presented lower titers of HCV RNA than patients harboring only HCV, suggesting that HCV replication might be potentially suppressed during HAV infection [59], although this will still require further investigation.",

Between two and three million people with European genealogy suffer from autoimmune diseases, the prevalence of which is also increasing in other populations across the globe [62]. There is rising evidence that the emergence of autoimmune diseases is associated with the presence of a number of immune-related alleles that have been selected via evolutionary processes; and, furthermore, that the contrasting differences in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases between populations may be a result of different selective pressures [63]. Alleles associated with inflammatory diseases that present marks of modern positive selection include the risk allele FUT2 at rs601338 for Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) or the risk variant SH2B3 at rs3184504 for celiac disease [64]; such variants have been linked to the development of several human autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, MS, and celiac disease [64,65]. The analysis of the integrated haplotype score [66] of loci associated with SLE that might provide protection against infections, such as TNIP1, ITGAM, PTPN22, TNFSF4, UHRF1BP1, TET3-DGUOK, and BLK, has suggested that these loci exhibit robust signs of positive selection [67] (Figure 4\n, Key Figure and Table 1). African and Asian human populations exposed to Trypanosoma brucei or Plasmodium sp. have presented positive selection of SNPs in the APOL1 and FCGR2B genes; indeed, by enhancing human macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes, despite their association with an SLE predisposition, these SNPs have been associated with protective roles against sleeping sickness and malaria, respectively [68,69].",

Many of these loci were also associated with the development of other autoimmune diseases, namely psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis [62]. PBMCs from individuals carrying the SH2B3 variant rs3184504*A (associated with a risk for developing CD) [71] presented higher production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or muramyl dipeptide due to enhanced activity of the NOD2 inflammasome pathway relative to controls [72]; this has suggested an immune-related role for SH2B3 in the context of bacterial infections, which might help explain the positive selection of SH2B3 approximately 1500 years ago [72]. Others found an association between genetic variants in NOD2, CD14, and increased susceptibility to CD [73], in line with previous results showing that mutations in NOD2 and TLR4/CD14 are related to an increased risk of developing IBD [74].",

However, these conditions may have reduced the exposure to viral and microbial agents that help the immune system to develop tolerance during childhood. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the lack of exposure to microbial agents in the early stages of life is related to a higher risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions, based on the fact that children that are exposed to higher amounts of microbial stimuli (e.g., by growing on farms) are less prone to develop allergies and asthma [75,76]. Moreover, reduced exposure to infectious agents can have a much wider effect than initially believed. Lack of exposure to microbes in childhood can cause aberrant responses to infection and potentiate the effects of ETV6\u2013RUNX1 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia [77]. By contrast, a meta-analysis of six observational studies, including 1902 participants, showed a correlation between low Helicobacter pylori infection and MS, suggesting that low H. pylori prevalence might be a putative protective factor in MS, although this remains to be experimentally validated [78]. One study also reported that antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii were detected less often in patients with MS compared with healthy controls [79]. However, these findings warrant further and robust investigation.",

            "text": "A growing number of reports suggest that inheritance is not always governed by classical Darwinian evolutionary processes. Exposure to certain environmental stimuli can cause effects in the progeny of an exposed individual, even though the stimuli are no longer present. This type of transgenerational inheritance might be explained through the effects of epigenetic processes, which are hypothesized to be transmitted through the germline and passed on to the offspring [80]. For example, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans can transmit improved resistance to infections to pathogenic bacteria to their offspring through alterations of the histone landscape [81]. Indian meal moths exposed to low doses of virus are subsequently less susceptible to viral challenge, a protection offered to their offspring as well [82]. Transgenerational inheritance of diverse traits has also been observed in mice, in which the variation of the color of the coat is passed on the next generation [83,84]. Offspring of male rats subjected to a high-fat diet present glucose intolerance and reduced insulin secretion, linked to reduced methylation at the Il13ra2 gene relative to controls [85]; and mice fed scorpions are more resistant to a challenge with scorpion venom than mice on a normal diet [86]. Since infections are one of the strongest factors impacting survival, it is conceivable that transgenerational transmission of traits in mammals, including humans, evolved to improve host defense. The number of studies of the potential role of epigenetic inheritance in shaping the human immune system is still scarce. However, different experiences undergone by certain communities indicate that these mechanisms might be important. For example, the babies of pregnant women who suffered during the early stages of pregnancy (the effects of the Dutch Hunger Winter in 1944), 60 years later showed reduced DNA methylation marks in several genes that control metabolism and cell differentiation during development, such as IGF2, PIM3, TXNIP, ABCG1, PFKFB3, and METTL8, compared with their siblings [87,88]. This was related with higher rates of obesity, heart disease, cancer, and depression in individuals whose pregnant mothers suffered the effects of the famine [87,88]. Some of these effects seemed to be present in the progeny of this group, that is, in the grandchildren of those who had passed the famine during pregnancy [89]. The rapid growth in the number of reports covering the impact of epigenetic mechanisms in different human processes warrants further and robust studies on the impact of epigenetic inheritance in shaping the evolution of the human immune system.",

These specific genetic variants are able to boost the host response against pathogens by improving the sensing of microbial ligands but can also lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system responds to endogenous ligands and induces abnormal responses targeted against the host\u2019s own tissues. Of note, it is very difficult to assign certain variants, a specific role in the protection or induction of autoimmunity. To assign changes in the genetic landscape of human populations to certain diseases is an extraordinary challenge. Moreover, our species is in constant evolutionary interaction with various microorganisms and viruses. Populations of bacteria and their viruses (phages) undergo, under natural conditions, reciprocal evolution in terms of resistance and infection; this, in turn, also affects the evolutionary traits of our immune system.

The mechanisms described here acquire special importance in the current scenario of world globalization, in which the migration fluxes and the admixture of different populations are reaching unprecedented levels, allowing faster expansion of advantageous alleles. However, these processes may also accelerate the spread of new epidemics, as seen in the cases of HIV infection, or more recently, SARS-CoV, Ebola, and chikungunya viruses; as well as the emergence of multiresistant bacteria and fungi, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus or Candida auris. This is just the starting point to unveil the evolutionary history of the relationships between pathogens, the immune system, and humans. Further investigation of the functional adaptations of human populations is warranted to provide a broad picture of the functional consequences of evolution in human immunity.Outstanding Questions\nWhich are the strongest evolutionary forces that drive the evolution of the human innate immune system?How long does the genome of a given population take to adapt to a new infectious threat?Are the mechanisms of resistance to infection transmitted only via genetic modifications, or can epigenetic adaptations to resistance also be transmitted to the progeny, and under what circumstances?The development of single-cell sequencing technologies has opened new fields of study. How does genetic variation of the expression of a specific variant vary between different cell subsets and how does it affect the overall phenotype of an individual within a population?Are there specific immune processes that are preferentially impacted by evolutionary pressures?In Western societies we enjoy a life expectancy vastly superior to that of our predecessors, but at the same time, we suffer diseases that they did not suffer. Can some of the reasons for these changes lie among some of those bacteria that we have somehow lost in our microbiome? Identifying these bacteria and understanding their effects on the human body might be the first step to developing putative therapies based on bacterial restoration.Since many of the variants causing autoimmune diseases are linked to an enhanced responsiveness to pathogens that is no longer needed in developed countries, could these genes and their related pathways be employed as targets for new putative therapeutic approaches against inflammatory/autoimmune syndromes?Are other newly described genetic regulatory pathways, such as interfering RNA or long noncoding RNAs, also influenced by pathogen-driven evolutionary processes in different populations globally?\n\n",

Since the parasite infects erythrocytes, the evolutionary pressure has selected genetic variants that affect red blood cells and, therefore, the survival of the parasite as well. Genetic variants conferring resistance to the disease have spread through human populations over time, including several abnormal hemoglobins that protect against malaria but usually cause erythrocyte-associated diseases in the populations where these adaptations are prevalent. These factors include the T125C polymorphism in the caspase 12 gene (CASP12); the Hemoglobin B (HBB) and Hemoglobin C (HBC) variants; mutations in the Duffy antigen receptor gene (DARC); thalassemias (\u03b1 and \u03b2); sickle cell disease; and polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci.",
