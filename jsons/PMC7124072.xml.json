It was estimated that in 2002, there were approximately 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections, which resulted in approximately 99,000 deaths [41]. A more recent meta-analysis of the costs and financial impact of HAI on the US healthcare system reported that the total annual costs for the five major infections (central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), surgical site infections (SSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)) were $9.8 billion (95 % confidence interval (CI) $8.3 to $$11.5 billion) [106]. There has been an unprecedented movement for healthcare facilities to improve patient safety and certainly prevention of HAI represents a major portion of that effort.",

Surfaces with frequent hand contact and in close proximity to the patient are often colonized with nosocomial pathogens, and most of these pathogens can remain viable on these inanimate surfaces for weeks to months (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08057-4_2 and ref [42]). Further, the distribution and dispersal of the microbes from healthcare workers, visitors and patients can contribute to the resident microbial flora of the built environment. Humans shed a minimum of ten million of their 100 million skin cells per day. Routine activities such as walking can result in the loss of approximately 104 skin particles per minute with a complete layer of skin cells being lost and replaced from healthy individuals on average approximately every 4 days [51]. The displaced skin cells are covered with the endogenous flora of the individual. Not all individuals shed skin equally. In one study of microbial dispersal by skin in a hospital ward, Noble defined a \u2018Staph aureus disperser\u2019 as a patient who contributed greater than six S. aureus per cubic meter of air [52]. Given that the mean concentration of bacteria within the ward was the equivalent of 800 viable bacteria per cubic meter, the concentration of S. aureus observed was thought to represent 1 % of the total flora [52]. Over the years the number has been revised to suggest that an individual is a \u2018Staph aureus disperser\u2019 when they are able to disseminate more than four viable particles per microbe per cubic meter of air [9]. Causality, or the linkage of an environmental isolate to that organism responsible for disease in individuals has been demonstrated as early as 1945 when deForest and Kerr reported cases of eczema which occurred amongst nurses that were caused by streptococci that were shed [26]. With the advent of molecular techniques, such as Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing, the ability to demonstrate casualty has now become much more straightforward but is still nevertheless time intensive and cost prohibitive.",

First, the pathogen must be able to survive on the objects and surfaces within the environment for a sufficiently long period of time while retaining its ability to be virulent or its ability to colonize a susceptible host after its subsequent liberation from the surface and resulting transmission/establishment. Second, contamination of the environment by a particular pathogen must be sufficiently frequent to account for its loss from the object or surfaces as a consequence of routine cleaning, desiccation, or starvation. Third, the agent must be present at a concentration sufficient to establish itself upon encountering the new host or location. Certain nosocomial pathogens, such as Norovirus, have incredibly small infectious doses with a median dose of 18 viruses [86] while the environmental dose of the causative agent of the majority of CAUTI, Escherichia coli, is not as evident. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) has classified that in the absence of symptoms a concentration of \u2265105 colony forming units (CFU) per ml coupled where \u22651 bacterial species is present in the urine of a catheterized patient that the individual has an asymptomatic catheter associated bacteriuria (CA-ASB) [35]. A CAUTI is defined as the \u201cpresence of symptoms or signs compatible with urinary tract infections (UTI) with no other identified source of infection along with \u2265103 CFU/mL of \u22651 bacterial species\u201d from a catheterized or previously catheterized (\u226448 h) urine sample [35]. However the guidelines are silent as to the origin and/or concentration of the microbe(s) required to establish the CA-ASB or CAUTI. The concept of infectious dose from the environment as it pertains to nosocomial infection has not been rigorously studied for the majority of the HAI. Further study is warranted.",

Focus has been placed on increased hand hygiene, contact precautions, and enhanced environmental cleaning. In 2006 Pittet and colleagues presented an evidence-based model arguing for improved hand hygiene practices during patient care as being the most important method for preventing HAI and spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens [61]. In their model, five steps are required for the transmission of pathogens within the clinical care setting. Collectively, the model considers the microbes and their transmission from objects, healthcare workers, and patients to the next individual or object. The first step requires that the microbe be present or resident on the patients\u2019/healthcare workers\u2019 skin or immediate environment. The concentration of the nosocomial pathogen can vary from as few as 1 to over 106 CFU per cm2. Subsequently, the microbe must be transferred to the healthcare worker. Simple acts such as lifting a patient, obtaining a blood pressure, pulse, or assessing a temperature can easily result in the transfer of between 100 and 1,000 CFU of a common Gram-negative pathogen Klebsiella spp. [19]. In fact these authors learned that 17 % of the staff of an intensive care unit were found to have Klebsiella contaminating their hands when screened and that the serotypes were related to those isolated from infected or colonized patients within the ICU on the same day [19]. Further advancing the importance of hand hygiene was a study that found healthcare workers were as likely to contaminate their hands or gloves from commonly-touched environmental surfaces as from direct contact with colonized patients [85].",

In other studies workers found that bacterial colonization of the hands of healthcare workers progressively increased with time [60, 62]. In these two studies they found that the concentration of commensal and pathogenic flora increased as a consequence of patient care. Additionally, the authors reported that the dynamics of hand contamination were independent of whether or not the healthcare worker was working while gloved or ungloved [60, 62].",

The fourth and fifth aspects of the model advanced by Pittet and colleagues addresses the issue of defective and/or absent hand cleansing and how it can lead to the cross transmission of the microbes [61]. Here they have raised the issue of the need to microbiologically validate proper hand cleansing in order to control the spread of microbes regardless of their source. In citing a study by Sala and colleagues, they describe how an outbreak of Norovirus was traced to an infected food handler within a hospital cafeteria. Here the implicated foodstuffs consumed during the outbreak were handmade by the infected worker [69]. Independently, it has been shown that Norovirus contaminated fingers can sequentially transfer this virus to up to seven surfaces [7]. Sequential transfer is not only confined to human to surface transfer. In the same study, the virus was found to move from contaminated cleaning cloths to clean hands and surfaces [7]. Recently, Snitkin and colleagues used whole genome sequencing to track an outbreak of Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumonia that occurred at the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center where they learned that despite early implementation of infection control procedures, including aggressive hand hygiene controls, the microbe persisted in the environment [83]. Consequently, the built environment can serve as a reservoir from which clean hands can serve as a source of HAI.",

Frequently touched hospital surfaces and medical equipment, such as doorknobs, bed rails, faucet handles, and intravenous (IV) poles, have been identified as reservoirs of pathogenic microbes [10, 56]. In addition to medical equipment and healthy or intact skin, there have been reports of the transfer of bacteria to the gloves and gowns of healthcare workers after patient contact [6, 18, 33, 49]. Specifically, Morgan and colleagues reported that the transfer of multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR) to the gowns and gloves of healthcare workers occurred after routine contact, and that this was found to increase as environmental contamination increased [49]. The intent of the study was to evaluate the differential rate of contamination by a MDR variant of Acinetobacter baumannii compared with other MDR bacteria while attempting to understand the importance of environmental contamination in the transfer of MDR bacteria to personal protective equipment (PPE, (gowns and gloves)) of healthcare workers. Here the microbe most frequently recovered was the extremely recalcitrant multidrug resistant variant of A. baumannii. Most striking however, were the conclusions that resulted from the modeling of their data. Here a positive environmental culture was found to be the strongest risk factor associated with the contamination of the clothing of the healthcare worker by MDR bacteria (Odds ratio (OR) 4.2; 95 % CI 2.7\u20136.5) [49]. Other independent variables, such as presence in the patient\u2019s room for greater than 5 min (OR 2.0; p = 0.014), performing a physical examination (OR 1.7; p = 0.019) or contact with a ventilator (OR 1.8; p = 0.014) were similarly significant in raising the likelihood or risk of transfer of MDR bacteria but at rates lower than the rate observed for a positive environmental culture [49]. Intuition would suggest transfer was greater when interacting with a patient. However, the higher risk associated with a positive environmental culture serves to reinforce the importance that the microbial burden of the built clinical environment represents to the set of circumstances required for colonization and infection of patients while hospitalized.",

In a study by Martinez, and others in 2003 an epidemiologic link was made between contaminated surfaces by VRE and subsequent VRE infection [46]. In another study where the environments of patients colonized or infected with VRE were evaluated upwards of 37 % of the environmental samples collected were found to harbor VRE [31]. The samples included patient gowns, medical equipment used for care, as well as environmental surfaces [31]. Controlling the spread of VRE to subsequent room occupants is challenging in that this microbe can be resistant to the disinfectants used for routine and terminal cleaning; even the use of bleach-based products have been reported to fail in their ability to eradicate the microbe from surfaces [22, 24] (See also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08057-4_9).",

MRSA and other nosocomial pathogens, including VRE and C. difficile can survive for months on dry surfaces (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08057-4_2 and ref [42]). MRSA has been documented for its ability to survive within hospital dust for up to a year [89]. Further, frequently touched hospital surfaces, such as doorknobs, have been implicated as reservoirs from which pathogens can be routinely recovered and thus transferred [56]. MRSA, like VRE, is ubiquitous in the hospital environment, especially in the vicinity of patients known to be colonized or infected [22, 24]. The chief method of spread is poor compliance with infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, by healthcare workers. Several studies have described endemic and epidemic contamination of the environment with MRSA. A recent review by Dancer and colleagues found that the site contamination mean for common objects in the patient\u2019s room with MRSA was 37 %, with high percentages found for such surfaces as overbed tables (40 %), bed rails (27 %), and other furniture (27 %) [23].",

The added risk of acquisition of MRSA to the 10,151 \u2018eligible\u2019 patients examined by their study was found to increase by an adjusted odds ratio of 1.4 (p = 0.04). Specifically, amongst the patients whose prior room occupant was MRSA positive (n = 1,454), 3.9 % of this cohort acquired MRSA, while only 2.9 % of the patients who occupied a room previously housing a MRSA negative patient (n = 8697) acquired MRSA. A similar risk profile of acquisition of the drug resistant microbe was similarly observed with VRE. Here 4.5 % of patients who occupied a room that previously housed a VRE positive patient (n = 1,291) developed VRE while the infection rate in patients housed in rooms previously occupied by a VRE negative patient (n = 9,058) had an attack rate of 2.8 % (adjusted odds ratio of 1.4; p = 0.02). The authors concluded that acquisition from previous occupants accounted for 40 % increased odds of transmission of MRSA and VRE strongly suggesting a role for environmental contamination, despite room cleaning methods that exceeded the national standard [37]. A review of the topic of the risk of nosocomial pathogen acquisition from prior room occupants was recently published [58]. Here Otter and colleagues reviewed the increased risk associated with other MDR microbes. Again the trend was the same. Patients who occupied rooms where the former patient was infected or colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or A. baumannii [55], or C. difficile [81] resulted in a similar increase risk of acquiring the previous occupants pathogen.",

Norovirus has been shown in several studies to be consistently transferred to frequently touched sites in a hospital, such as door handles and telephones [24].

            "text": "In summary, since the seminal paper by Weinstein in 1991, substantial evidence implicating the environment as a continuous source of risk for the acquisition of HAI has accumulated to such an extent that there now exists significant interest in learning how to manage and provide best-practice applications for infection control for hospitals [8, 12, 13, 15]. Evident from the previous discussion, microbes have an intrinsic ability to survive and ultimately colonize common touch surfaces where acquisition and transport from surfaces to humans is common. Healthcare workers have the potential to transfer these microbiological contaminants not only from patient to patient but amongst themselves and back to surfaces, refreshing or adding to the complexity of the microbial reservoir involved in transmission. There have been many studies looking at the control of contamination of common hospital touch surfaces both from hand to surface contact and vice versa. Investigators have shown that the gloves of nurses frequently collected viable MRSA after touching inanimate objects near colonized patients [16]. In concert with aggressive hand hygiene campaigns recent hygiene guidelines specifically recommend that particular attention be paid to the disinfection of patient-care surfaces, especially surfaces designated \u201chigh touch objects\u201d (HTOs) as a target of infection prevention and control [78]. The guidelines note that such objects could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) or by contacting medical equipment that subsequently contacts patients [8, 29, 64, 67, 72, 73, 90]. Routine or daily cleaning coupled with cleaning immediately after patient discharge (terminal cleaning) of the surfaces and objects within the room with subsequent application of a hospital grade disinfectant has been an accepted method for controlling and limiting the spread of infectious agents [68]. A concentration of between 2.5 and 5 aerobic CFU per square centimeter has been proposed as the benchmark where bacterial levels below this value are considered to represent a minimum of risk while concentrations greater are suggestive of an increased risk of HAI acquisition [22, 44].",

In the intervening years a number of devices have been developed to deploy this disinfectant/sterilant as a vapor into the built clinical environment. In one study conducted by Passaretti and others, an evaluation of the environmental and clinical impact of this no-touch technology was assessed [59]. In a 30 month prospective cohort intervention trial involving 6 high risk units from a 994 bed tertiary care hospital, they learned that patients admitted to rooms decontaminated using HPV were 64 % less likely (p < 0.001) to acquire any multi-drug resistant microbe and 80 % less likely to acquire VRE (p < 0.001) after adjusting for other factors [59]. Again, the complexity inherent to the transmission and distribution of microbes within the built environment, coupled with the stochastic nature of care, well illustrates that the risk of acquiring C. difficile, MRSA, and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods were reduced, but failed to reach significance. However, in spite of the failure to reach significance the effectiveness of this no-touch infection control solution was able to significantly alter the proportion of rooms environmentally contaminated with MDRs. Here the concentration of MDRs in the HPV treated units were significantly reduced (relative risk, 0.65, p = 0.03), but not on non-HPV treated units leading the authors to conclude that the use of HPV can reduce the risk of acquiring MDRs compared with standard cleaning protocols [59].",

These two technologies, HPV and UV, have been found to be effective for the disinfection of inanimate objects and surfaces. However, neither technology is intended as a substitute for cleaning or for the removal of soil from the resident objects and surfaces within the built patient care environment (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08057-4_9). An appropriately trained environmental service team must accomplish cleaning, with subsequent disinfection of the built environment.",

However, unlike UV and vapor phase oxygen radicals (H2O2) that distribute their antimicrobial activity through the atmosphere, this technology requires the microbe come in contact or be in close proximity with the material in order to facilitate its antimicrobial activity. In contrast to UV and HVP, once placed, this no-touch system simply requires that the fugitive microbe come in contact with the surface in order to effect disinfection. Thus, the inactivation or killing of the microbe does not require any user intervention once deployed. One such example of this type of no-touch technology is solid antimicrobial copper. The resident microbial burden associated with the built environment is continuously reduced through the strategic placement of solid copper surfaces onto critical high touch surfaces within the patient care setting [75].",

Metallic copper intrinsically displays a strong antibacterial activity in aquatic systems [2, 38] as well as on dry surfaces [32, 54, 96, 102, 104]. In 2008 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered five families of copper-containing alloys as antimicrobial, establishing that products manufactured from one of these registered alloys can make public health claims wherein the label indication states that the alloys kill greater than 99.9 % of bacteria within 2 h of exposure [87]. It is anticipated that the solid antimicrobial copper surfaces will remain microbiocidal for the life of the product (>10 years). A variety of controlled studies have looked at the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against specific human pathogens [54, 63, 92, 98, 102, 104, 105]. In fact solid copper surfaces have been found to be microbicidal to well over 30 bacteria, fungi and viruses. Of the microbes listed in Table 4.1, five were evaluated in the studies used to grant the public health registration by the United States EPA. The public health claims granted illustrate the robust nature of the antimicrobial activity. Alloys granted registration contain greater than 60 % metallic copper and were found to continuously kill greater than 99.9 % of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria within 2 h of exposure even after repeated contamination illustrating how solid copper surfaces will inhibit the buildup of microorganisms between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.\n",

Copper-alloyed surfaces offer a continuous way to limit and/or control the environmental burden. Hospital and environmental services need not perform additional steps, follow complex treatment algorithms, obtain \u201cbuy-in\u201d from other providers or require additional training or oversight. The other \u2018no touch\u2019 methods presently in wide scale use for room disinfection rely on discontinuous modalities of application in order to reduce the environmental bacterial burden [34]. Hydrogen peroxide vapor is introduced as a gas into a sealed room. Ultraviolet light achieves its effectiveness through the transient transmission of germicidal radiation within an unoccupied room. Consequently, like the EPA registered disinfectants regularly used to disinfect patient rooms subsequent to cleaning, both UV and HPV will likely suffer from the same limitations of the rapid restoration of the bacterial burden intrinsic to high touch objects.",

            "text": "The mechanism of action associated with the antimicrobial properties of solid copper surfaces is multifaceted (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-08057-4_6). Upon coming in contact with the metallic copper surfaces of objects, the electron potential of the microbe in concert with copper facilitates a cascade of irreversible events leading to the rapid death of the bacterium. Given the inherent ability of solid metallic copper and its alloys containing greater than 60 % copper for the conduction of electricity, the electrons resident in the membrane of the bacterium that are sufficiently close to the metallic surface coupled with the high flux required by living cells result in the rapid collapse of the proton motive force of the microbe. The subsequent dissipation of the proton motive force (PMF) has been observed through the use of dyes that measure the membrane potential. Warnes and others have reported on this observation on numerous occasions for both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria [91\u201393, 95]. Subsequent to the collapse of the membrane potential a concomitant production of free radicals immediately develops within the cytoplasm of the bacterium. The free radicals facilitate the peroxidation of the membrane, bleaching of cellular proteins and the cleavage and subsequent complete destruction of the nucleic acids resident in the cytoplasm of the effected microbes. Additionally upon peroxidation of the membrane there is a loss of membrane integrity resulting in the subsequent leakage of the cytoplasm from the cell and diffusion mediated transport of copper ions into the cytoplasm. The copper ions then act in concert with the free radicals resulting in a Fenton reaction that leads to further irreparable damage to the cell [91]. The entire process occurs quickly resulting in the collapse of a population within minutes. Thus, the likelihood that the population will develop resistance to this multifaceted mechanism of death is unlikely. There have been reports in the literature of bacteria being isolated from copper coins but upon challenging the \u2018resistant\u2019 isolates they were found to be uniformly sensitive to metallic copper [71]. A likely explanation for their recovery from the surface is likely a consequence of a failure to sufficiently collapse the PMF of the entire community as either a function of proximity of the surviving microbes to the metallic surface or the absence of sufficient electron flux through the membrane to initiate the cascade required for death.",

Properties of strength and durability were operationally defined such that the resulting component would be able to withstand the rigors placed on the finished goods within the built environment of an active clinical setting and for the ability of the materials to withstand standard hospital cleaners, including sodium hypochlorite. Additionally, the surface finish was to provide consistent wear and aesthetics over the lifespan of the product. All of the copper alloys used for component fabrication were made from solid alloys registered with the EPA [87].

Should these conclusions expand to other areas of the hospital, then employing inherently antimicrobial surfaces could represent a significant enhancement to mitigating infectious bacteria within hospitals. For example, by instituting a \u2018best practices\u2019 approach that implemented cleaning and hand hygiene designs and protocols, the California\u2019s Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Initiative showed a reduction of HAI by 3.2 %. With many of these best practices already in place, the initial findings from the clinical trials are showing an additional double-digit reduction in infections.",

Consequently, items where antimicrobial copper alloys might have been easily incorporated, e.g. grab bars, sinks, faucets, paper dispensers, shelves and towel racks were not present. The further evaluation of antimicrobial copper surfaces is warranted beyond the medical ICU to include, but not be limited to, the effect of inherently antimicrobial materials in general wards where patients have greater interaction with other objects in the built environment. Similarly, investigations should also be conducted in emergency and recovery rooms, in hospital rehabilitation units, pediatric and neonatal units, dialysis centers, burn units, transplant units and cancer centers with immune-compromised patients. At issue is the central theme that antimicrobial copper surfaces continuously and passively limit the concentration of bacteria within the built environment. Salgado and colleagues were able to demonstrate that infections were correlated with burden. Thus, other healthcare environments that may arguably receive less day-to-day hygienic oversight than hospital patient rooms, such as visiting area, long-term care facilities, long-term rehab centers, outpatient clinics and elder care facilities should also be investigated as they too may directly benefit from the antimicrobial activity of copper.",

However, with renewed interest and study the risk contribution provided by the built environment towards patient care warrants a better understanding of the dynamics of colonization and infection.
