            "text": "In the early 1980s the need for a new drug solubilizer for parenteral formulations became apparent. The way one solubilized intractable, poorly water-soluble drugs for parenteral use during this period was pH-adjustment for ionizable drugs and use of co-solvents or surfactants. However, reports by Dye and Watkins, 1980, Watkins, 1979, H\u00fcttel et al., 1980 began to describe anaphylactoid like reactions, later also called Idiosyncratic Histamine Release, with the use of the popular surfactant Cremphor EL. Other surfactants were also implicated. These observations were critical as around 1984, a novel, breakthrough drug to treat breast and ovarian cancers, taxol, later known as paclitaxel, was in clinical studies in women at the National Cancer Institute. The clinical formulation used consisted of a taxol/paclitaxel concentrate of 50% each of Cremophor EL and ethanol. This concentrate was then diluted with Normal Saline (NS) prior to infusion to patients. In the mid-1980s a number of women receiving paclitaxel had severe reactions to this solvent, namely, the Cremophor EL component. As Rowinsky et al., (1993) later stated, \u201ca high incidence of major hypersensitivity reactions due to the Cremophor EL vehicle used in formulation disrupted and almost terminated the clinical development of paclitaxel.\u201d",

Our initial hypothesis was that a polar, charged cyclodextrin, unable to be taken up by or interact with kidney tubule cells, might prove less renally toxic. The etiology of the renal toxicity was unknown at the time but there was a general feeling that cholesterol was somehow involved based on the findings of Frank et al., (1976).",

Fortunately, around 1988/89 we were able to fund the Center for Drug Delivery Research (CDDR), a Center of Excellence within the Higuchi Biosciences Center (HBC) at the University. HBC was funded in part by State of Kansas resources through the Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation (KTEC) that was designed to help academic institutions take technologies developed at Kansas academic institutions up to investment grade technologies from which either companies can be spun out or the technology could be licensed. Thus, the early work by us, using post-doctoral students and technicians was to refine, using this new source of funding, our cyclodextrin technology. The goal was to refine the technology to the point where one could think about starting a company and/or licensing the technology because the financial risk factor to a licensee of a nascent technology had been lowered.

The SAB included of a number of pharmaceutical industry executives and a venture capitalist. This was one of the first times that the technology was disclosed to the pharmaceutical industry. A representative from Pfizer, Dr. K. George Mooney expressed interest as Pfizer had just found out that the parenteral form of voriconazole, which was in the clinic using HP- \u03b2 -CD as a solubilizer, could no longer use that cyclodextrin because licensing negotiations with Jansen, who had the rights to HP- \u03b2 -CD, had broken down. Pfizer needed an alternative solubilizer. The SBE- \u03b2 -CD disclosure at the board meeting was a \u201cRight Place, at the Right Time,\u201d moment.",

Benefits to the University, other than eventual royalties, were that Pfizer would perform the scale-up and safety studies etc. that would become part of the Master File with the FDA and that the University would have access to the Master File, thus making it available to future licensees.

The first led the university to set up an internal group to handle efforts like it had just gone through, that is, a group to handle patents and technology coming from university investigators. Most research-intensive universities now have such groups. The second, was to spin out from the University a company to help commercialize and license to other companies what became known as Captisol\u00ae. That company was CyDex, started by the University, a group of angel investors, Peter Higuchi and Dr. Diane Thompson. CyDex is now a part of Ligand Pharmaceuticals.",
