            "text": "Serious viral infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). They occur in the majority of allograft recipients and are fatal in 17\u201320% 1, 2. These severe infections may be prolonged or recurrent and add substantially to the cost, both human and financial, of the procedure 3, 4, 5. Many features of allogeneic HSCT contribute to this high rate of viral disease. The cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs administered pretransplant to eliminate the host hematopoietic/immune system and any associated malignancy, the delay in recapitulating immune ontogeny post\u2010transplant, the potential for induction of immune tolerance/T\u2010cell anergy upon exposure on an immature system to an active viral infection, the immunosuppressive drugs given to prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD), and the effects of GvHD itself, all serve to make HSCT recipients vulnerable to disease from endogenous (latent) and exogenous (community) viruses, and to be incapable of controlling them as quickly and effectively as most normal individuals.",

            "text": "Over the past 20 years, great strides have been made in identifying and implementing effective therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of many of the serious virus infections that afflict HSCT recipients. By combining effective agents with rapid molecular analyses that can detect the early reactivation of latent infections, it has been possible to transform the outcome of patients with post\u2010transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Agents such as ganciclovir and rituximab 6, 7, 8, respectively, can now be used to control CMV and EBV before they cause serious or fatal illness. Despite these and other advances in early detection and prompt treatment, post\u2010transplant viral illness remains a major threat. As might be expected, improvements in viral prophylaxis and treatment have encouraged clinicians to extend the range of patients to whom HSCT can be offered as a curative option for their disease. A high proportion of patients who are now transplanted lack siblings who are identical for human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) (major histocompatibility antigens), necessitating the use of alternative stem cell sources including HLA\u2010partially matched unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors or cord blood units. These patients may require donor T cells to be removed from the infused stem cell preparation or may need to receive more intensive or prolonged post transplant immunosuppression, increasing their susceptibility to viral disease and prolonging the duration of this enhanced susceptibility. Moreover, the considerable success of ganciclovir and rituximab against CMV and EBV disease has yet to be followed by the availability of additional agents that can as effectively and safely treat the many other virus infections to which transplant patients are susceptible (Table \n1). Even when pharmacological therapies are available, these agents are costly, associated with significant toxicities, and may lead to the outgrowth of drug\u2010resistant mutants. Since none of these agents improve virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell immunity, the root cause of post\u2010transplant viral infection, these diseases frequently recur after termination of treatment. In this review, we describe the immunotherapeutic strategies that have been explored by our own and other groups to achieve safe, effective, and sustained antiviral prophylaxis and treatment following HSCT and discuss the success and limitations of this approach.",

The expectation was that these cells would expand in the recipient after adoptive transfer and provide protective immunity. In terms of antiviral activity, providing that the donor has had prior virus exposure, donor peripheral blood does indeed contain memory T cells specific for a broad range of viruses, which reflect the life\u2010time exposure of the host to an array of pathogens, and DLI has proved to be an effective treatment for both adenovirus (AdV) infections and EBV\u2010associated post\u2010transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) 14, 15, 16. Unfortunately, broader application is limited by the low frequency of virus\u2010specific T cells compared with the much higher frequency of alloreactive T cells that can cause GvHD, a particular concern in HLA mismatched recipients who are most at risk of viral illness. Up to 10% of circulating T cells may be alloreactive 16, 17, while the frequency of T cells with a given antiviral specificity may be many logs lower (Fig. \n1). Even when DLI is used to successfully treat EBV infections, a high rate of GvHD is observed, and T cells reactive to many common community viruses such as parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are frequently all but undetectable in the peripheral blood of the stem cell donor, making this approach too high risk to be widely used to prevent or treat associated viral disease post\u2010transplant.",

One such costimulatory signal is delivered by the B7.1 and B7.2 molecules on antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs) to the CD28 receptor on T cells, and blockade of this interaction using fusion proteins (such as CTLA4\u2010Ig) or monoclonal antibodies (such as anti\u2010B7.1 and \u2010B7.2) during T\u2010cell receptor (TCR)\u2010APC engagement has been demonstrated to induce antigen\u2010specific hyporesponsiveness in T cells. Guinan et al. 18, 19 have successfully used both blockade strategies clinically. Two days prior to transplant they harvested haploidentical donor marrow, which was incubated with recipient\u2010derived mononuclear cells in the presence of either CTLA\u20104\u2013Ig or anti\u2010B7 monoclonal antibodies. These anergized T cells were then administered at the same time as the HSCT. In two pilot studies, they found that even when products contained large numbers of alloanergized donor T cells (range 7\u2013129 \u00d7 106 CD3+ cells/kg) there was acceptable engraftment with less severe acute GvHD than historical control recipients of haploidentical stem cells replete with unmanipulated T cells.

Andre\u2010Schmutz et al. 40 used CD25 conjugated to the ricin \u03b1 chain to allodeplete haploidentical (n = 13) or matched unrelated (n = 3) donor T cells that were then infused early (days 15\u201347) post\u2010transplant to a cohort of pediatric patients. Each patient received multiple infusions of 1\u20138 \u00d7 105 allodepleted cells/kg, with no GvHD prophylaxis. Even at the highest dose level, the allodepleted T cells were found to be safe, in contrast with earlier studies reporting GvHD \u2265Grade II in 40% of patients after infusion of 1 \u00d7 105 unmanipulated donor T cells/kg. In addition, the investigators found evidence that the allodepleted cells retained a virus\u2010specific component. Two patients with EBV or CMV developed a high frequency of circulating virus\u2010specific T\u2010cell precursors postinfusion and both cleared their respective infections. Solomon et al. 27 applied this approach to adults, infusing 16 patients (median 65 years) with haploidentical T cells that were also allodepleted with an anti\u2010CD25 immunotoxin. This group of patients would have been considered to be at high risk of developing GvHD but in fact only eight patients developed this complication, which was mild to moderate (GvHD Grades I\u2013II) and steroid responsive in six and severe only in two. The development of GvHD appeared to correlate with the efficiency of allodepletion. Our group also demonstrated that the infusion of CD25\u2010allodepleted cells to haploidentical HSCT recipients was safe and that a threshold of at least 1 \u00d7 105 allodepleted T cells/kg was required to accelerate antiviral T\u2010cell recovery 23, 41, 42.",

They used a photoactive rhodamine derivative, 4,5\u2010dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402), which efficiently diffuses into both resting and activated T cells. While resting T cells can actively extrude the dye, it is selectively retained in the mitochondria of activated cells due to the inactivation of the multidrug transporter. These activated cells are then sensitive to visible light (514 nm), which results in mitochondrial oxidation and cell death. Taking advantage of this property, Mielke et al. 43 co\u2010cultured donor cells with activated recipient\u2010derived T cells followed by addition of TH9402 and exposure to visible light. Twenty\u2010four HLA\u2010identical sibling HSCT recipients received a dose of 5 \u00d7 106 photodepleted cells/kg on day 0. Unfortunately, the results were disappointing. Both acute and chronic GvHD were frequent, and infectious complications associated with viral (CMV, AdV, BK virus, RSV), bacterial and fungal pathogens were common and unexpectedly prolonged and severe so that the trial was halted. In this study, it was unclear whether severe GvHD was associated with variability in the infused photodepleted products.",

They also emphasized the importance of choosing the optimal recipient\u2010derived stimulator cell to achieve robust alloactivation, the impact that variability in the efficiency of allodepletion can have on in vivo safety, and the narrow and unpredictable therapeutic window between the desired antiviral activity and unwanted GvHD. Moreover, since T cells specific for the majority of viral pathogens circulate at frequencies that are lower than EBV and CMV (Fig. \n1), it is likely that extremely high doses of allodepleted T cells would be needed to provide full spectrum anti\u2010viral protection and that, even after allodepletion, the cell doses required would likely exceed the GvHD threshold. Finally, the allodepletion approach, at present, can only reliably be used when donor and recipient are haploidentical. Where there are fewer HLA disparities or differences only at minor histocompatibility antigens (e.g. in an HLA matched sibling transplant), the degree of alloactivation produced in the mixed lymphocyte cultures is insufficient for consistent removal of all alloreactive T cells. Consequently, the ratio of viral reactive to alloreactive T cells is not sufficiently improved to obtain beneficial antiviral effects in the absence of increased GvHD.",

            "text": "The most widely tested in vivo allodepletion approach uses the thymidine kinase gene from herpes simplex virus I (HSV\u2010tk) 44. TK expression in transgenic T cells catalyzes the phosphorylation of the non\u2010toxic prodrug ganciclovir into the active agent. After transformation into the final triphosphate form by cellular kinases, the drug acts as a GTP analog, thus inhibiting DNA chain elongation and killing dividing cells. Several phase I\u2013II studies have shown that ganciclovir administration can be used to deplete transferred TK\u2010modified cells in vivo and no adverse events related to gene transfer have been reported 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. However, induction of transgenic cell death may require many days and is usually incomplete, potentially delaying clinical benefit. In addition, since ganciclovir is required for cell elimination this precludes its use as an antiviral agent (e.g. for the treatment of CMV) in this highly susceptible patient population. Finally, the TK gene product can be immunogenic 51, 52. For example, the relatively immune competent patients post HLA\u2010identical HSCT can mount a TK\u2010directed CD8+ T\u2010cell response leading to the premature and unintentional elimination of infused cells 53, 54. Despite these potential limitations, phase I and II clinical studies have shown TK\u2010T cells can consistently benefit immune reconstitution and that GvHD can be controlled by ganciclovir administration so that the approach is now being evaluated in a multicenter, multi\u2010national phase III study that it is hoped will allow licensure of this important approach.",

We found that CID treatment eliminated 90% of the infused transgenic cells within 30 min, with a further log depletion during the next 24 h 55. The patients' GvHD responded fully and did not recur even when the residual transgenic T cells re\u2010expanded.

The investigators used a panel of CMV IE1 and pp65 tetramers to select specific T cells from nine SCT donors that were administered to six recipients of a matched related donor transplant and three recipients of matched unrelated transplants who had CMV reactivation. Although the infused product was composed exclusively of CD8+ T cells, the cells expanded by several logs in vivo, and in eight of nine cases CMV viral load became undetectable post transfer. No case of CMV disease was seen. Uhlin et al. 59 used pentamers to isolate T cells from the mother of a cord blood transplant recipient with rituximab\u2010resistant EBV\u2010PTLD.

These directly selected cells expanded postinfusion and produced a complete clinical response. Although antiviral protection was non\u2010sustained, since EBV\u2010PTLD recurred at 12 months, the disease was eradicated by a second infusion of the same cells 59.

We administered small numbers (5 \u00d7 106\u20131.5 \u00d7 108 cells/m2) of these in vitro expanded donor\u2010derived bivirus or trivirus VSTs to recipients (age range 1\u201363 years) of haploidentical, HLA\u2010matched related or unrelated donor transplants, none of whom developed GVHD. Postinfusion, we observed a detectable increase in the precursor frequency of T cells directed against both EBV and CMV in peripheral blood, but circulating AdV\u2010specific T cells increased only in those recipients who also had evidence of an AdV infection, demonstrating the importance of in vivo restimulation by viral antigens to support the expansion of the infused cells. We also saw evidence of activity against all three viruses in vivo\n101, 102. Ten of 11 patients with CMV reactivation (defined as increased CMV DNA or CMV antigen positive) had a complete or partial response (defined as >50% reduction in the viral load) to VSTs, with a coincident increase in CMV\u2010specific T cells. Similarly, seven patients with evidence of EBV reactivation (including 1 with EBV\u2010PTLD) also responded to VSTs, with a marked expansion of EBV\u2010reactive T cells. Finally, six or eight recipients with AdV infections (defined as culture positive in their respiratory tract, blood, or stool) or disease at the time of VST infusion had a marked reduction in their adenoviral load concomitant with a rise in the frequency of their circulating AdV\u2010specific T cells. This included one patient with progressive adenoviral pneumonia requiring maximal ventilatory support who had a complete response to VSTs with clearance of AdV from his respiratory tract. All results are summarized in Tables \n2\nand\n3. It is also noteworthy that neither bivirus nor trivirus VST recipients developed de novo AdV infections post\u2010infusion, in contrast with an incidence of 68% in similar patients who did not receive VSTs 67, suggesting that the infused cells may survive at levels below the threshold for detection and protect patients long term, perhaps by entering the memory pool. This possibility is supported by our ability to detect AdV\u2010reactive cells after a single ex vivo restimulation of blood T cells with adenoviral antigens 99, 100, 103. Hence, broad spectrum antiviral protection and treatment can be provided from a single infusion of cells and small numbers of T cells can provide long\u2010term antiviral protection.",

We replaced our adenovector and EBV\u2010LCLs by generating DNA plasmids encoding immunogenic antigens from EBV (EBNA1, LMP2, BZLF1), CMV (IE1, pp65), and AdV (Hexon, Penton), which could be introduced into APCs, such as DCs, using the clinically acceptable AMAXA nucleofection system. In preclinical studies, we achieved high level transgene expression following nucleofection of DCs with good viability during the period of T\u2010cell activation and the reproducible generation of VSTs that were phenotypically similar to our conventionally generated VSTs (mix of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, a proportion of which retained expression of the central memory marker CD62L), and that contained virus\u2010specific T cells at frequencies that were comparable or superior to conventional products 104. Clinical grade plasmid\u2010DNA can be rapidly and cost\u2010effectively produced in scalable quantities with excellent long\u2010term stability. Since plasmids are non\u2010infectious, non\u2010replicative, and integrate poorly into the transfected cell genome, this approach also alleviates safety concerns. Thus, transition to such an antigen source would substantially lower the production costs of VSTs.",

This system is extremely labor intensive, highly skilled, and essentially unscalable. The frequent media changes required to optimize nutrient and cytokine levels and remove waste products make contamination a constant risk and still allow T cells to undergo significant cell death. Efforts to substitute the closed and scalable bioreactor systems that are widely used in other types of clinical cell culture systems failed to produce VSTs with the same anti\u2010viral specificity and effector function. To address this logistic issue, we collaborated with Wilson Wolf Manufacturing to develop a new disposable gas permeable rapid expansion device (G\u2010Rex), which dramatically reduces T\u2010cell apoptosis during culture, resulting in more efficient in vitro expansion. In this static device, gas exchange (O2 in and CO2 out) occurs across a gas permeable silicon membrane at the base, allowing for the initial input media volume to be increased, which in turn increases the available nutrients and dilutes waste products without the need for culture agitation, frequent culture feeding, or continuous medium perfusion 106, 107, 108. These optimized growth conditions allow for higher antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell densities per unit surface area to be achieved (8\u201310 \u00d7 106 per cm2 in the G\u2010Rex compared with approximately 1.5 \u00d7 106 per cm2 in wells), and incorporation of this platform substantially simplifies VST production by minimizing the number and complexity of cell manipulations without affecting the phenotype or function of the generated T\u2010cell lines 109.",

Efforts to make VSTs that were consistently specific for additional viruses had foundered on the problem of antigenic competition. This phenomenon occurs due to competition between virus\u2010derived peptides to become bound to HLA molecules expressed on shared APCs and the physical constraints on the capacity of APCs to simultaneously engage T cells with different specificities if these are present at substantially different frequencies. Indeed, even the conventional trivirus (EBV+CMV+AdV)\u2010directed VSTs described above are dominated by CMV\u2010specific T cells at the expense of the EBV and AdV\u2010specific components, so that both the breadth of AdV epitopes recognized and the magnitude of the response to them is less in the trivirus products than in bivirus products generated using EBV\u2010LCLs transduced with an adenoviral vector lacking the CMV\u2010pp65 transgene 100. This antigenic competition and the resultant production of lines with restricted viral specificities precludes the generation of potent, broad\u2010spectrum effector T cells that would be effective against the complete array of pathogens present in HSCT recipients.",

Thus, we increased the range of viral antigens that could be recognized by a single VST line and thereby mitigated the impact of antigenic competition. We supplemented cultures of peptide\u2010pulsed PBMCs with cytokines shown to support T\u2010cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (IL\u20102, IL\u201015), as well as cytokine combinations (IL\u20104+IL\u20107) that support retention of a central memory phenotype, and promote activated T\u2010cell survival by upregulating anti\u2010apoptotic molecules 110, 111. When lines were supplemented with IL\u20104+IL\u20107, we observed expansion and survival of both CD4+ and CD8+ virus\u2010specific T cells within the PBMCs, which recognized multiple viral epitopes and killed virus\u2010infected targets 105. The induced cells were Th1\u2010polarized despite exposure to IL\u20104, a prototypic Th2 cytokine. Importantly, these VST cultures lacked alloreactive T cells, even when the VSTs had been produced by only a single in vitro stimulation with viral peptides.

Each patient received 0.5\u20132 \u00d7 107 cells/m2 from day 27 post\u2010HSCT. One patient developed a mild and localized skin rash postinfusion, but this patient also had an intercurrent BK infection and had presented with a similar rash during an earlier episode of BK reactivation. No other infusion\u2010related toxicities were noted. Overall, our clinical response rate was equivalent to that achieved in our previous trials of trivirus\u2010directed T cells generated using EBV and AdV vectors for manufacturing, with 90% of subjects with active AdV, CMV, and/or EBV infections having a measurable increase in circulating T cells directed against the infecting virus(es), and clearance of both single and dual viral reactivation/disease. Importantly, the lines in this study were generated without exposure to biohazards (live virus/viral vectors) and were manufactured in only 17 days (versus 8\u201312 weeks for \u2018conventional\u2019 VSTs) and from 60 ml of peripheral blood without evident loss of efficacy 112.",

Whether such cells will have the same in vivo persistence and antiviral activity as VSTs generated from seropositive donor peripheral blood remains to be seen 114.

            "text": "Despite the clinical benefit associated with VST therapy and the ease of manufacturing afforded by our production refinements, the need to generate specific VSTs for each individual patient renders this approach impractical for widespread or urgent use, or when the donor lacks viral immunity (as for cord blood transplant described above). To circumvent this requirement, investigators have prepared and administered banks of closely HLA\u2010matched VSTs that are \u2018off the shelf\u2019 products and so are available for immediate use. Administration of such products is, however, associated with some concerns. Most lines administered will be mismatched at one or more HLA\u2010loci, which may either increase GvHD postinfusion due to alloreactivity of the line or reduce in vivo persistence and antiviral benefit, due to the alloreactivity of the recipient. Despite these concerns, a number of studies have shown that the approach is feasible, safe, and effective, with reports of a high level of clinical responses. For example, Haque et al. 115, 116 used third party EBV\u2010specific VSTs to treat PTLD after solid organ or HSCT transplantation. In this study, patients received four doses of 2 \u00d7 106 VSTs/kg at weekly intervals and the lines were selected for matching by low resolution typing and screened for high level killing of donor EBV\u2010LCLs and low level killing of patient\u2010derived PHA blasts. No patient developed organ rejection or GVHD, and the study showed response rates of 64% and 52% at 5 weeks and 6 months respectively. The degree of HLA matching between the line and the recipient ranged from 2/6 to 5/6 HLA antigens, and at 6 months, there was a statistically significant trend toward a better outcome with closer matching 115, 116. In a second report, two solid organ transplant recipients with CNS lymphoma received closely matched EBV\u2010specific T cells leading to complete resolution of brain lesions due to EBV\u2010LPD 117. Similarly, the Memorial Sloan Kettering group reported that third party EBV\u2010specific VSTs produced complete responses in four of five patients with EBV PTLD after HSCT (including two cord blood transplant recipients) 83, 118. More recently, our group applied this approach to treat patients with refractory CMV, AdV, or EBV infections 119. In this multicenter study, we established a bank of 32 trivirus\u2010directed VSTs using conventional manufacturing approaches, 18 of which were administered to 50 recipients of allogeneic HSCTs [marrow (n = 24), peripheral blood (n = 33), or cord blood (n = 12 single and 13 double units)]. Our bank was of sufficient size for us to identify a suitable line for 90% of the patients screened for participation. Lines for infusion were chosen based on the presence of activity against the infecting virus through a shared HLA allele(s), which requires a comprehensive analysis of viral epitopes in the VSTs and the identification of the HLA restricting elements associated with each. Once activity against the infecting virus through a shared HLA allele(s) was confirmed, further selection of the best line was based on the overall degree of HLA match. Of the 50 patients who were treated, 74% had a complete or partial response (74% for CMV, 78% for AdV and 67% for EBV), the majority of which were durable (Table \n4). In vivo T\u2010cell persistence, monitored using deep sequencing analysis, indicated that donor VST\u2010derived TCR sequences became apparent concomitant with a reduction in viral titers and persisted 4\u201312 weeks postinfusion. Although long\u2010term (beyond 3 months post\u2010infusion) analysis was not performed the expectation is that the third party cells were eliminated concomitant with endogenous immune recovery. Indeed, of the 50 patients treated, 14 required between 2 and 6 VSTs to sustain clinical benefit. However, we saw no significant de novo GvHD, and only one episode of secondary stem\u2010cell graft failure (in a patient with relapse). Thus, this study, like the other applications of banked VSTs, observed no associated increase in toxicity.",
