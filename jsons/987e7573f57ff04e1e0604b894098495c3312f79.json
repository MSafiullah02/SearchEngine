As prevalence falls, a non-specific test such as CT, which does NOT test for the virus, will become highly misleading. For those who fear an insensitive RT-PCR test, supplementing it with a sensitive, but non-specific, test simply introduces a different error. The clinician is then left not knowing which one to believe. We may as well look at the sediment pattern of tea leaves (tasseography) to determine which one is correct in an asymptomatic subject.",
