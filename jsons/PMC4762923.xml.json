            "text": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal diseases, responsible for over 40 % of all cases in the USA, and this number is likely to increase unabated [1]. Overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in the development of the disease [2]. Current treatment, aimed at slowing progression, concentrates on two inter-related therapeutic strategies: blood pressure reduction and blockade of the RAS [3\u20135]. Such treatments have been shown to reduce the functional changes seen in DN and also to attenuate the structural abnormalities that characterize this disease [6\u20138]. At present, blockade of the RAS is achieved by two major drug classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs), agents that also lower systemic blood pressure [9]. However, they are not completely effective in preventing or reversing the progress of DN, in part due to a compensatory increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) or Ang II [10]. Current therapies are insufficient, necessitating the search for new therapeutic strategies in DN.",

In our previous study, we demonstrated that an epitope from the rat AT1R, designated as ATR12181, could decrease SBP of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and provide excellent protections in target organs [12]. Following our work, Hiroshi Itoh and his colleagues emphasized vaccination against AT1R for the prevention of L-NAME-induced nephropathy in SHRs, not only for the attenuation of hypertension [13]. Ang II and other components of RAS also have a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic renal injuries. Accordingly, this study was designed to explore the possibility of the ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine in ameliorating of experimental DN and the potential mechanisms. The study was undertaken in Sprague Dawley rats treated with streptozotocin that developed renal injury similarities to human DN [14].",

All animals were kept in the pathogen-free room in the experimental animal center (Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China), and all experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province, China, 2005). Experimental diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of the \u03b2 cell toxin streptozocin (60 mg/kg) dissolved in fresh sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) following an overnight fast. Animals with plasma glucose concentrations in excess of 16.7 mmol/l, 1 week postinduction of diabetes, were included in the study. Sham-injected control animals (sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5) were followed concurrently. Diabetes rats were then randomized into four groups (n = 15), receiving one of the following treatments: (1) DN group: equal volume saline injection subcutaneously (s.c); (2) OM group: olmesartan, 5 mg/kg/day via oral gavage; (3) ATRQ\u03b2-001group: the ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine, which was immunized s.c 400 \u03bcg on days 0, 14, and 21, formulated in aluminum hydroxide gel; (4) virus-like particle (VLP) group: 400\u03bcg Q\u03b2 VLP injected as group 3. Each week, rats were weighed and their blood glucose levels were measured. ATR-001-specific antibody titers were detected in every 2 weeks. Every 4 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was determined in preheated conscious rats via tail-cuff plethysmography using a non-invasive blood pressure controller and PowerLab system.",

The nephropathy subcommittee of the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC) has published the following validation criteria for rodent models of DN based on the clinical and pathological features of human DN: (1) >50 % decrease in renal function, (2) >10-fold increase in albuminuria, and (3) pathological features including advanced mesangial matrix expansion (\u00b1nodules), thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, arteriolar hyalinosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [17]. An ideal model of DN would display all of these criteria; however, no current model entirely satisfies them. That is the limitation in animal experiments. As the rodent models share many similarities with human disease, we cannot ignore the potential therapeutic value of the vaccine in the treatment of human diseases. Our results showed that rats presented severe hyperglycemia and renal dysfunction manifested as increased plasma creatinine level, BUN, 24 h urinary volume, and protein excretion, indicating that a DN animal model was successfully established. The ratio of kidney weight/body weight in diabetic groups was significantly increased compared with that in control group, substantial to the presence of renal hypertrophy in diabetic rats. During the course of the study, systolic blood pressure was elevated in diabetic rats, notwithstanding the limitations of tail-cuff sphygmomanometry, ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccination lowered blood pressure (BP) smoothly, and olmesartan decreased to a greater extend. It is worth noting that our animal experiments showed many times that the antihypertensive effect of ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine was dependent on the baseline of the BP level and exhibited no decreasing effect in normotensive rats. Oppositely, ARBs decreased BP irrespective of the basic level and had an increase risk of hypotension. Therefore, ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine may be more practical in diseases where the BP was not very high, such as DN.",

Nevertheless, kidney Ang II concentration and AT1R expression were decreased in both groups. The recent development of ACE2-Ang (1\u20137)-mas concept has provided new insights into the effects of Ang II in animal experimental models. This novel concept states that RAS has two axes: the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang (1\u20137)-mas axis. The former axis induces vasoconstriction, proliferation, and proinflammatory functions through Ang II, and the latter axis counteract the effects of the former axis through the major heptapeptide effector Ang (1\u20137) [18, 19]. ACE2 cleaves Ang II to produce abundant levels of Ang (1\u20137) in the proximal tubule, which produces vasodilation and antiproliferative, natriretic, and diuretic effects [20]. Despite its significant role, the exact role of ACE2 and Ang (1\u20137) in kidney disease is not clearly understood. It has been reported that inhibition of ACE2 function accelerates diabetic injury and human recombinant ACE2 reduces the progression [21, 22]. Moreover, Ang (1\u20137) attenuates the progression of diabetic nephropathy in animal models [23, 24]. Our study showed a downregulation of ACE2-Ang (1\u20137)-mas axis in diabetic rats, and the beneficial effects of ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine and olmesartan treatment may partly due to the upregulation of this axis. Although the exact mechanism of how these two axes counteract with each other remains unknown, we can conclude that the vaccine regulates the two RAS axes, not only inhibiting AT1R overactivation.",

            "text": "Safety considerations are paramount when developing any vaccine but are particularly important when targeting a condition for which many safe and effective alternative therapies are available. Four key factors define the safety of therapeutic vaccine: (1) the targeted molecule, (2) the reversible of antibody response, (3) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and (4) activation of T cells against self-molecules [25]. Combined with our previous studies, vaccination-targeted AT1R showed no immune-mediated injuries [11, 12] and was also confirmed in this study. The antibody response was reversible as the possibility of halting antibody production. For ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity, there are still several controversies in terms of its onset and regulation. Nevertheless, the potential effects caused by the vaccine needed further investigation. As the target peptide of the vaccine was only eight amino acids in length, then it was smaller than the minimal size of a T cell epitope and therefore should not be able to induce a T cell response [26]. Several studies had estimated that vaccines comprising self-molecules coupled to VLPs present optical candidates capable of achieving efficacious antibody levels while fulfilling the necessary safety criteria [27, 28]. Examples like the Ang II vaccine CYT-006-AngQb, which showed effectively reduced BP without any uncontrolled immune stimulation in both animals and patients [29, 30]. Similar to the composition, the kidney damage caused by immune complexes was not detected and no visible pathological changes were observed by light microscopy and TEM in ATRQ\u03b2-001-vaccinated animals. From the results above, the ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine was found to be basically safe, although further assessments are needed to confirm this conclusion.",

            "text": "Compared with chemical drugs, the vaccine therapy has potentially superior advantages. The half-life of the anti-ATR-001 antibody was 14.4 days [11], longer than any other chemical drugs presently used. No obvious feedback activation of circulating or local RAS was observed. Additionally, long-term treatment of chronic diseases is costly, tedious, and at the population level rather unsuccessful. Monoclonal antibodies specific for host proteins have proven to be highly effective, and the movement from the passive administration of monoclonal antibodies to active vaccination against self-molecular could provide affordable medicines and broader patient acceptance and compliance. The question today in many patient populations is not whether to block the RAS but rather how best to inhibit its activity. From a theoretical perspective, vaccination has much to recommend it as a strategy. ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine modulates two major axes of RAS and ameliorates STZ-induced diabetic injury with no obvious immune-mediated damages, providing a promising therapeutic method to treat diabetic nephropathy.",
