The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States and the Korean Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (KCDC) have provided guidelines for infection control measures at healthcare facilities.4,5 In addition to the use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers (HCWs), ensuring that all visiting patients and guardians wear face masks and adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols is crucial. Here, we share our experience in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a hospital through strict monitoring at the hospital entrance by ensuring that all visitors wear face masks and practice strict hand hygiene.",

Since then, Chungbuk National University Hospital (CBNUH), an 810-bed referral hospital in Cheongju with ~2,300 employees and 3,000 outpatient visits per day, has undertaken hospital entrance control measures. These measures include reducing the number of unnecessary access points, checking the body temperatures of visitors using a thermal camera, and ensuring that all visitors and employees adhere to hand hygiene protocols and wear face masks, regardless of symptoms. The number of gates to the hospital was reduced from 5 to 2 during the day and to 1 at night.",

The KCDC requested an in-hospital epidemiologic investigation of all close contacts because they needed to quarantine them for at least 14 days. We started contact investigations using a photo of the patient and closed-circuit television recordings of the hospital entrance area. We identified the patient trying to enter the hospital. The alarm of the thermal camera was activated because the patient had a fever. To confirm the fever, a contactless thermometer was used by the hospital guard to check her body temperature, which was 38.3\u00b0C. The patient was guided to the COVID-19 screening clinic in a separate area of the emergency department. Nevertheless, the patient tried to re-enter the hospital through another gate. Similarly, the thermal camera was activated, and officials returned her to the COVID-19 screening clinic. The patient and all personnel who encountered her were wearing face masks. We identified 3 persons who had come into close contact with the patient: 2 hospital security guards who were wearing face masks, and 1 hospitalized patient who passed by within 2 meters and was not wearing a face mask. Even though the contact was brief, those who had close contact with this patient self-monitored with delegated supervision for 14 days,6 and none became ill with COVID-19.",

Wearing eye shields protects HCWs in case of an accidental encounter with patients not wearing face masks.4,5 Individual preparedness in accord with major guidelines is crucial in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare centers.",
