COPD is a very common disease affecting 65 million patients in the G7 countries (U.S., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, U.K. and Canada) and is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. [3]. In 2010, the cost to the U.S. for COPD was projected to be approximately $49.9 billion, including direct health care expenditures, indirect morbidity, and indirect mortality costs [4]. The direct cost of treating COPD exacerbations alone in the U.S. may exceed $18 billion.",

Diagnosis of asthma and classification of its severity are primarily based upon symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath combined with an assessment of airflow obstruction and the level of control observed with various therapeutic interventions. Recent data from the Asthma Clinical Research Network suggest that approximately half of patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate asthma presented with either a persistent or intermittently persistent eosinophilic phenotype that was responsive to combined anti-inflammatory therapy, while the remaining half of patients presented with a persistently non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype that was less-responsive to similar intervention [6]. With respect to severe asthma, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) revealed five distinct phenotypic clusters within severe asthma highlighting the heterogeneity of the underlying molecular, cellular, and physiologic manifestations of the disease [7].",

Cigarette smoke is the main risk factor for COPD, in addition to air pollution, biofuel, and occupational exposure [8]. Diagnosis of COPD is based on presentation of symptoms of chronic cough, dyspnea, or sputum production in conjunction with spirometry assessment where a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of <0.70 is indicative of COPD. COPD may present as a heterogeneous mixture of physiologic manifestations including chronic bronchitis and parenchymal destruction (emphysema) [2]. During exacerbations, there may be increased hyperinflation and gas trapping leading to a reduction in airflow and enhanced dyspnea [9]. Recent adaptations to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) assessment of disease feature a combined COPD assessment that includes the association between symptoms, spirometric classification, and future risk of exacerbations, with subjects of GOLD grade 3 or 4, or subjects with 2 or more exacerbations per year, considered as at high risk for having an exacerbation [10].",

Rather, experimental infection of healthy adult human volunteers has provided much of our understanding regarding the biology of HRV infections, which are the respiratory viruses most commonly associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Initially, HRV challenge studies in healthy volunteers have been used to study and develop therapeutics for the common cold. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of virus induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and to develop agents to prevent and treat them, studies in which selected subject populations with asthma or COPD are challenged with a characterized virus strain have been more recently employed. By building on this experience, small controlled viral challenge interventional studies in asthma and COPD early in clinical development could help triage agents that have the potential to attenuate the manifestations of naturally-acquired HRV infections leading to disease exacerbations. This review will summarize common respiratory viruses, the role they play in acute exacerbations of airway diseases, and recent advances in HRV challenge studies with particular emphasis on those studies conducted in subjects with asthma and COPD.",

The annual rate of COPD exacerbations has been estimated to range from 0.5 to 3.5 exacerbations per patient [16], [26], [27]. Such virus-induced exacerbations can result in disease worsening that requires increased pharmacologic treatment, visit to the emergency room, hospitalization, admission to intensive care, and death. For example, in-hospital mortality rates associated with acute exacerbations of COPD vary markedly between studies (2.5\u201330%), depending upon comorbidities and the mode of recruitment and setting (medical ward versus intensive care unit) [24], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34].",

Specifically, an increase in HRV-16 viral replication and cell lysis was associated with resistance to early apoptosis after HRV infection and a deficient type I interferon (IFN-\u03b2) response [71]. A subsequent study demonstrated that asthmatic subjects challenged with HRV-16 experienced enhanced lower respiratory symptoms and bronchial hyperreactivity associated with greater bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocyte concentrations and dysregulated IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 responses compared with normal subjects [68].",

Due to the generally mild and self-limiting nature of HRV infections in healthy adults, a direct antiviral agent for HRVs would need to be exceptionally safe with little to no safety risks for use in this population. While a number of antiviral agents specifically directed against HRVs (eg, capsid-binding compounds, 3C protease inhibitors, inhibitors of the ICAM-1 receptor) have been in clinical trials, they have typically shown minimal efficacy or toxicities, and their development has been terminated due to the lack of an acceptable benefit\u2013risk profile (reviewed in Refs. [81], [82]). Current treatments for rhinovirus infections are palliative and include antipyretics and decongestants. Herbal and natural supplement-based treatments (eg, echinacea, ascorbic acid [vitamin C], zinc) have not been shown to be clinically effective [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88]. Given the high hurdles for HRV antivirals and the widespread use of over the counter treatments to treat symptoms, it is not surprising that there are no direct antivirals for HRVs currently in clinical development (Clinicaltrials.gov, February 2014).",

The only nonhuman primate able to be productively infected by major class HRVs is the chimpanzee [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], although the gibbon has also been reported to be able to be infected [100], [101]. Chimpanzees are an endangered species, and the restrictions placed on research with chimpanzees makes their use unrealistic based on ethical reasons. Currently, the United States and Gabon are the only countries that allow medical research to be conducted on chimpanzees, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have recently reassessed the use of chimpanzees in medical research [102] with the intent of eliminating their use in favor of alternate models. In addition, a systematic review of the use of chimpanzees in monoclonal antibody and drug development encompassing almost 2 decades (1981\u20132010) continue to identify key differences in human and chimpanzee immune functions and highlights the difficulty of predicting results in human patients based on data from chimpanzees [103]. This is supported by the fact that although chimpanzees can be productively infected by HRVs, they do not develop the clinical symptoms associated with the \u201ccommon cold\u201d. In addition, all but 1 species of gibbon are listed as endangered or critically endangered, and gibbons have also been reported not to develop cold symptoms.",

            "text": "Attempts to infect vervet monkeys and a wide variety of other primate species with HRVs have been unsuccessful [104]. This is due to the fact that approximately 90% of HRVs (previously designated as major group HRVs) use the human intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as the receptor to infect cells [105], [106]. These major group HRVs are only able to use ICAM-1 of human or chimpanzee origin [107], [108]. Conversely, minor-group rhinoviruses bind a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family which is shared between mouse and human. Infection with minor-group rhinovirus-1B in BALB/c mice has been shown to elicit an acute influx of inflammatory cell types including neutrophils and lymphocytes, neutrophil and T-cell-associated chemokines, type I and type II viral-associated IFN response and mucin production [109], [110]. However, HRVs belonging to the minor group represent approximately only 10% of known HRVs. To address these issues, recent efforts from the same group focused on developing transgenic mice engineered to express a chimeric murine-human ICAM-1. This work demonstrated that human chimeric ICAM transgenic mice on a BALB/c background can be infected by HRV-16, and that the results were similar to those observed with minor group rhinovirus-1B in wild type mice [109]. While there are certainly differences between HRV infection in humans and the chimeric ICAM transgenic mouse model with respect to correlation of clinical parameters related to cold symptoms, the model can be used to assess the impact of rhinovirus exacerbation of allergic disease when combined with the ovalbumin model of allergic airway inflammation. Subsequent work has since demonstrated the utility of testing an anti-human ICAM-1 antibody that binds domain 1 of human ICAM-1 in this model, resulting in a reduction in the level of cellular inflammation and cytokine production associated with rhinovirus infection in addition to a reduction in viral load relative to baseline pre-infection and isotype control post-infection [111].",

In addition, since animals such as mice do not naturally develop asthma or COPD, the underlying baseline inflammatory profile and the acute pathology that mice develop in response to viral challenge in these experimental models may not be completely reflective of human disease [104], [113]. This, coupled with the inability of these species to be naturally infected with HRVs and other human viral respiratory pathogens, the high titer of viral inoculum required for infection (generally 106 50% infectious dose in tissue culture [TCID50] versus 5 to 10 TCID50 in humans), and minimal replication of virus make these models less than ideal for studying virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Translation of observations from in vivo animal models to human disease with respect to assessing potential candidates for therapeutic intervention remains to be clinically validated. For all these reasons, experimental infection of humans with HRV in controlled challenge models may have greater utility in the development of therapeutic agents to intercept and treat viral exacerbations of asthma and COPD.",

To minimize risk, these studies typically enroll subjects with mild to moderate stable disease and exclude those with poor lung function, poorly controlled disease, and a history of recent hospitalizations due to exacerbations. The experimental HRV infection studies completed to date have been quite helpful in defining underlying mechanisms associated with the host response to HRV infection. However, as the magnitude of symptoms in these experimental infection studies can be less marked than those in naturally occurring exacerbations in patients with severe disease, it can be more difficult to detect a significant treatment effect when assessing potential therapeutic candidates in these studies.",

Atopic or mild asthmatic subjects were inoculated intranasally with 10 to 10,000 TCID50 of HRV (again, most commonly HRV-16 or HRV-39), and clinical symptoms, lung function, and biomarker host immune response data were collected. In these experimental viral challenge studies, infection was generally well tolerated, and the subjects experienced clinical symptoms of the common cold similar to that observed in healthy control subjects; some experienced increased chest symptoms (eg, cough, phlegm production, and wheezing) compared with healthy subjects. Some subjects with mild to moderate asthma exhibited enhanced host immune response to the viral challenge including increased BAL lymphocyte concentrations and enhanced lower respiratory symptoms [68]. Typically, viral replication peaked at Day 3 post infection and local inflammatory response and symptoms peaked at 5\u20136 days post infection. In atopic individuals and mild asthmatic subjects, lung function did not appear to be impaired to a significant degree. However, in some studies, more pronounced effects upon lung function (eg, statistically significant decreases in FEV1 and PEF) have been observed [118], [124], [223]. The majority of these studies are performed in mild asthmatics to reduce the potential for inducing severe acute exacerbations.",

In one of the allergen/RV challenge studies [124], [125], 2 out of 24 subjects withdrew due to an asthma exacerbation. One subject had a spontaneous exacerbation during the placebo-allergen period prior to HRV-16 infection, and another subject developed an HRV-induced exacerbation on the second day after inoculation with a high dose (0.4\u20138.6 \u00d7 104 TCID50) of HRV-16 after 2 weeks of exposure to allergen (house dust mite extract).

To assess the impact of steroid therapy on HRV infection in asthma, mild asthmatics were experimentally infected with HRV-16 while being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide 800 \u03bcg twice a day for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks prior to HRV-16 infection). No worsening of airway inflammation based on induced sputum in the asthmatic subjects was observed [212]. In a subsequent study [174], 47 asthmatic male subjects were randomized to receive oral prednisone (20 mg) or placebo 3 times a day for 5 days. Steroid treatment was initiated 11 h prior to inoculation with HRV. No safety concerns were reported, suggesting that treatment with prednisone did not impair the host response to HRV infection. In a recent preliminary study of experimental HRV-16 infection in 11 moderate asthmatic subjects already receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), no safety concerns such as withdrawal due to safety issues, serious adverse events, or requirement for treatment beyond extra bronchodilator use were reported [225]. The response to HRV infection as measured by cold symptom and asthma scores was similar to that previously observed in subjects not receiving ICS therapy, and the host response as measured by CXCL10/IP-10 protein in sputum and nasal lavage was also similar. Interestingly, even in a population of moderate asthmatics, a decrement in lung function was not observed, although this may have been due to increased bronchodilator use during the study.",

[232] employed a dose escalation approach to determine the minimum dose of HRV-16 required for a productive infection in GOLD stage II (moderate) COPD subjects, in addition to assessing safety parameters to establish the model in this new population. Follow up studies addressed the impact of smoking and also mechanistic questions related to host immune response to HRV-16 in COPD. Comparing subjects with COPD and control subjects (non-obstructed subjects with a similar smoking history, but normal lung function) demonstrated that subjects with COPD exhibited increased upper and lower respiratory symptom scores, reduced post-bronchodilator PEF, increased viral load in nasal lavage and sputum, and increased inflammatory markers relative to their baseline values when compared with control subjects following experimental infection with HRV-16. Daily upper respiratory symptom scores peaked earlier at Days 3 and 4 in COPD subjects while lower respiratory symptom scores peaked later at Day 9. The peak expiratory flow trough was observed at Days 5 through 9. Peak viral titers were delayed somewhat relative to that observed in asthmatics (Days 4\u20136), however a lower inoculum of only 10 TCID50 was employed in the study which may have resulted in a longer period of time to reach peak viral titer. Additional investigation provided insight into secondary bacterial infections following rhinovirus infection which develop on average 9\u201315 days post-inoculation in approximately 60% of COPD subjects, but were observed in only 10% of smoking and non-smoking control subjects. These data highlight the frequency of secondary bacterial infections in COPD and suggest a potential impact of earlier intervention with antiviral therapies to reduce both primary viral-induced COPD exacerbations and complications associated with potential secondary bacterial infections [228]. Evaluation of lymphocyte subsets showed lower frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the periphery and increased frequencies of CD3+ and CD8+ in BAL in COPD subjects relative to controls [110], and also differences in neutrophil adhesion and activation markers in COPD subjects relative to control subjects following infection with HRV-16 [230]. Overall, experimental HRV infection was well tolerated without any serious adverse events in both the COPD and control populations. Additional work exploring specific components of the host innate immune response to acute infection with HRV-16 may help to provide further insight into the association of severe acute viral-exacerbation in COPD with specific clinical phenotypes of disease.",

Significant work has been done to date using in vitro systems to assess the impact of HRV infection on primary cells derived from subjects with asthma or COPD, and to further define specific mechanistic components of host innate response at the cellular level [233], [234], [235]. This work has been critical in guiding potential biomarker work in subsequent experimental viral challenge studies in humans. Recent advances in propagation of human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) in human sinus and airway cells differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI) has provided a means to study additional relevant HRV strains beyond the few serotypes that have been used to date, potentially providing a path forward for evaluating host response to HRV-C in experimental challenge models in humans [236], [237]. Additionally, naturally occurring HRV infection in humans has provided additional although retrospective data defining the host immune response to acute HRV infection. Serum CXCL10/IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein 10 [IP10]) has been demonstrated as a biomarker associated with HRV infection in COPD [49], [226], and has also been suggested as a potential biomarker in asthma based on in vitro experiments and assessment of acute naturally occurring infection in asthmatics [221].",

Additionally, subjects with specific and predefined clinical phenotypes may be recruited to help further elucidate potential different mechanisms of susceptibility associated with virus-induced exacerbations compared to a broader heterogeneous population. Recent advances in transcriptomic and proteomic platforms, in addition to advances in computational biology approaches to building experimentally-defined networks of disease, may help to provide additional tools to better understand the relationship between acute viral exacerbation of asthma and COPD and rhinovirus infection.",

Corticosteroids broadly inhibit immune-mediated (eg, cytokines, chemokines, cell-mediated) inflammatory responses. In one study [170], the effects of combined intranasal and systemic corticosteroids on the local inflammatory response and symptoms due to experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy adults was examined. In this study, 45 adults were randomized to prophylaxis with either placebo or steroids. Intranasal beclomethasone (168 \u03bcg twice a day) was initiated 4 days before viral challenge and continued 5 days after challenge. Oral prednisone (30 mg twice daily) was given for 3 days starting 1 day prior to challenge. During the first 48 h after viral inoculation, nasal obstruction, nasal mucus weights, and kinin concentrations in nasal lavages were lower in steroid recipients, but subsequent increases in these variables in the steroid group resulted in no significant cumulative differences between treatment groups. These data suggest that steroid prophylaxis may suppress nasal inflammation and cold symptoms during the first 2 days in experimental rhinovirus colds. No adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. Recent emerging data has highlighted the impact of rhinovirus infection on steroid responsiveness in an airway epithelial ex vivo cell based system. RV-16 infection impaired dexamethasone-dependent inhibition of IL-1\u03b2\u2013induced CXCL8 release, induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 gene expression, and binding of GR to GREs in airway epithelial cells, indicating that RV-16 infection of human airway epithelium induces glucocorticoid resistance [240]. Given the large use in the daily clinical practice of inhaled/systemic corticosteroids for viral-induced exacerbations, the pros and cons of therapeutic intervention with corticosteroids must be considered in the context of specific clinical presentation.",

            "text": "Although initially identified as agents of the common cold, HRVs are significant human pathogens associated with significant respiratory illnesses such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and are the predominant virus associated with acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD are the result of a complex interaction of a multitude of variables making the development of agents to prevent or treat exacerbations a tremendous challenge. Variability arises from a number of factors that include the infecting virus (type of virus, particular strain, timing of infection, inoculum size), host-related factors (genetics, phenotype of asthma, prior infections and immune response/immunity, inherent microbial flora), host medical history (e.g. comorbidities, concomitant medications), and environmental conditions (e.g. aeroallergens). Due to the lack of an animal species that is naturally permissive for HRVs to use as a facile model system, coupled with the limitations associated with animal models of asthma and COPD, experimental infection studies in humans have been crucial to our understanding of the biology of HRV pathogenesis. The controlled nature of these HRV challenge studies helps to alleviate much of the variability associated with studying naturally occurring disease exacerbations. These experimental infection studies have focused on trying to understand the immune-mediated inflammatory response (i.e. cytokines, chemokines, other mediators, cell types, and signaling pathways) to HRV infection in asthmatics and patients with COPD often by comparing the responses between healthy and affected populations, or the responses among patients with different severities of disease. In addition, although the development of GMP manufactured HRV challenge stocks is not trivial, experimental infection with serotypes of HRV other than HRV-16 or HRV-39 will be critical in determining if the results obtained with the isolates of HRV-16 and HRV-39 used most frequently can be extended to other serotypes such as those in the HRV-C group, which may be a relevant group for individuals with asthma [243]. Experimental challenge studies in subjects with specific and predefined clinical phenotypes associated with asthma or COPD may help to further elucidate potential different mechanisms of susceptibility associated with virus-induced exacerbations compared to a broader heterogeneous population.",

Although HRVs can be associated with serious complications such as pneumonia in severely immunosuppressed individuals (such as bone marrow transplant recipients), there have been no reports of pneumonia or other serious complications in published studies of experimental infection with HRV in healthy adults, subjects with mild to moderate asthma or subjects with COPD, even in the context of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. These experimental infection studies with HRVs are crucial to our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD triggered by HRV infection, and are essential for the development of agents to prevent and treat exacerbations. Recent advances in transcriptomic and proteomic platforms, in addition to advances in computational biology approaches to building experimentally-defined networks of disease, may also help to define potential points of interception to either repair inherent deficiencies in innate anti-viral immune response or to reduce exaggerated host response to acute viral infection.",
