Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10-and Myosin Vadependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.",

Most MyoVa is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (see below) but a small amount of total cellular MyoVa associates with primary cilia (Kohli et al, 2017) and regulates ciliogenesis (Assis et al, 2017) . Wu et al (2018) reported that MyoVa mediates transport of preciliary vesicles from the peri-centrosomal region to the distal appendages of the mother centriole. To explore the possible contribution of MyoVa to centriolar RILPL2 localization, we depleted MyoVa using siRNA and then monitored the localization of exogenously expressed B) . To our surprise, RILPL2 localized to the mother centriole in >50% of MyoVa-depleted cells, even under non-ciliating conditions, compared with ~15% of control siRNA-transfected cells (Figs. 2C, D) . These data indicate that MyoVa transports RILPL2 away from the centriolar region under non-ciliating conditions. Note that both N-terminally HA-and GFP-tagged RILPL2 were detected at the centriole upon serum starvation (Figs. 1B, D) or MyoVa depletion (Fig. 2D) , however less C-terminally tagged RILPL2-GFP localized to the centriolar region in parallel experiments, suggesting a role for the RILPL2 C-terminus in centriolar localization, as reported previously (Schaub and Stearns, 2013) .",

We therefore explored the relationship between RILPL2 expression and pRab10 distribution. In cells expressing R1441G LRRK2 to generate pRab10, RILPL2 was cytosolic (Red, Fig. 3A ) and a fraction (~20%) was concentrated in the peri-centriolar region with pRab10 (Green, Figs. 3A, B) . pRab10 was significantly more concentrated in the centriolar region than RILPL2 under these conditions. Upon co-transfection in control cells, RILPL2 and MyoVa showed minimal colocalization that was limited to a few distinct puncta, and most RILPL2 protein was cytosolic (Fig. 3C ).",

When MyoVa-FL was co-expressed with GFP-Rab10, more of it re-localized to perinuclear, Rab10 containing vesicles (Fig. 5C ), consistent with its established binding capacity. In contrast, Exon D-deleted MyoVa (MyoVa-\u0394D) showed much less colocalization with Figs. 5C, E) . Surprisingly, expression of R1441G pathogenic LRRK2 relocalized both MyoVa-FL (Fig. 4C ) and the MyoVa-\u0394D to perinuclear membrane structures positive for pRab10 (Fig. 5D ). Quantitation of colocalization revealed that MyoVa colocalized with pRab10 to almost the same extent, with or without Exon D (Fig. 5E ). Importantly, even the normally diffuse GTD (Fig. 5B ) redistributed to pericentriolar, pRab10 + membranes ( Fig. 5F ): 35% of total MyoVa GTD colocalized with pRab10, while ~80% of pRab10 co-localized with GTD (Fig. 5G) . These values match closely the extent of RILPL2 relocalization seen in earlier experiments (Fig. 3) .",

As shown in Fig In experiments in which we monitored binding to RILPL2-GFP, MyoVa-GTD bound with or without LRRK2 activity, but we detected about twice as much MyoVa-GTD and Rab10 precipitating with RILPL2 in cells expressing R1441G LRRK2 (Figs. 6D,E). These data are consistent with pRab10 binding both RILPL2 and MyoVa, perhaps forming a ternary complex. Since RILPL2 can dimerize (Wei et al, 2013; Waschb\u00fcsch et al, 2020) , it is possible that each half of the dimer engages either MyoVa or pRab10 or both. Alternatively, pRab10 may enhance the ability of MyoVa to bind RILPL2.",

To further explore the mechanism of RILPL2-mediated cilia blockade, we investigated the effect of RILPL2 expression on centriolar CP110 cap removal upon serum withdrawal. As shown in Figure 9D , fewer cells expressing RILPL2 lost CP110 from their mother centrioles, indicating that RILPL2 expression inhibits ciliogenesis at an early stage, upstream of TTBK2. CP110 also failed to be released from the mother centriole in MyoVadepleted cells within 2 hours of serum starvation (Fig. 9D ), a condition that leads to redistribution of RILPL2 to the mother centriole ( Figure 2C ,D). Wu et al (2018) reported that MyoVa knockout cells showed no effect on CP110 release but had a striking defect in ciliary vesicle association with mother centriole. This difference might be explained by adaptation in knockout clones and/or a very short time of serum starvation (30 mins) in Wu et al (2018, Supp Fig. 4B ) versus acute, siRNA-mediated MyoVa depletion and longer serum starvation (2 hours in serum free medium) in our experiments (Fig. 9D ).",

We have shown here that RILPL2 is diffusely localized in RPE cells, and a small portion moves to the mother centriole within ~3 hours of serum starvation (Figs. 10A,B) . The dispersed localization of RILPL2 is controlled by its MyoVa binding partner: depletion of MyoVa tripled the percent of cells displaying centriolar RILPL2 protein (Fig. 10C ). This suggests that MyoVa functions at least in part to transport RILPL2 away from the mother centriole. In contrast, when expression of pathogenic R1441G LRRK2 increases pRab10 at the mother centriole, RILPL2 levels also increase there, and additional co-expression of low levels of MyoVa is sufficient to drive essentially all RILPL2 to the centriole (Fig. 10D ). MyoVa is normally broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm but it also concentrated at the mother centriole when pRab10 levels are high. In addition, peri-centriolar concentration of MyoVa and RILPL2 both require Rab10 protein.",

The globular tail domain of MyoVa is a versatile cargo adaptor with independent binding sites for RILPL2, Rab11A, Rab3A and melanophilin. Future experiments will determine the precise interface between pRab10 and MyoVa and whether or not pRab10 binding precludes interaction with additional binding partners. That MyoVa is a Rab11 effector suggests that it will function as part of the Rab11:Rab8 cascade that is an important part of the early steps of cilia formation (Kn\u00f6dler et al, 2010; Franco et al, 2014) .",

This is unlike what we reported previously for RILPL1: loss of RILPL1 enhances cilia formation, as if it's normal role is to repress this process . Nevertheless, like RILPL1, expression of HA-RILPL2 blocks ciliogenesis, perhaps by sequestering important components (such as MyoVa or Rab10) in a manner that interferes with their ability to function. Interestingly, video microscopy of protein recruitment to the mother centriole upon serum starvation shows that fluorescently tagged MyoVa arrives within 30 min (Wu et al 2018) whereas GFP-RILPL2 required more than two hours. This points to a possible lead role of centriolar Rab10 in recruiting MyoVa protein. As for RILPL2, its recruitment to the centriolar region could reflect binding to peri-centriolar vesicle-associated Rab10, MyoVa, or both.",

Interestingly, all of these proteins are implicated in some way in the normal process of ciliogenesis and all become clustered around the mother centriole in cells expressing pathogenic LRRK2 kinase that are blocked in ciliogenesis. Are any of these components more important than another in regulating cilia formation? In our previous work, we showed that RILPL1 and Rab10 are essential components of the LRRK2-mediated, ciliogenesis blockade . Here we show that loss of RILPL2 has no consequence for cilia formation, while RILPL1 depletion significantly enhances cilia formation. According to mapofthecell.biochem.mpg.de, RILPL1 is present at 72,522 copies per HeLa cell and 98% cytosolic, compared with 45,719 copies of MyoVa, which fractionates most significantly with endosomal markers (Itzhak et al, 2016) . However, RILPL2 was below detection in this tour de force mass spectrometry experiment (Itzhak et al, 2016) . Similarly, the ratio of RILPL2 to RILPL1 is quite variable across tissues (pax-db.org) and cell lines and thus differences in the contributions of RILPL1 and RILPL2 to ciliogenesis blockade may reflect their relative abundance in different cell types. Unlike RILPL2, RILPL1 does not bind MyoVa. As described herein, any role for RILPL2 in blocking ciliogenesis likely requires MyoVa participation since it so significantly altered RILPL2's cellular distribution.",

MyoVa depletion also blocks release of CP110 in our experiments, and this may be explained in part, by the increase in peri-centriolar RILPL2 seen in cells depleted of MyoVa. Indeed, MyoVa strongly regulated RILPL2's localization, consistent with their tight molecular association and cooperative roles. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2 kinase, MyoVa and pRab10 drive a major relocalization of RILPL2 to the mother centriole, and it will be important to explore further how this contributes to a pathogenic LRRK2-triggered ciliogenesis blockade.",

RPE cells were transfected with Fugene HD (Promega) while A549 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer. RPE cells stably expressing mKO2-PACT were generated by lentivirus as described at (Sobu et al, 2020) . Cells were checked routinely for Mycoplasma using either MycoALert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza LT07-318) or PCR. Cells were grown to confluence in DMEM with serum. hTERT-RPE cells were ciliated by overnight serum starvation in DMEM medium alone. For A549 cells, cells were plated at 80% confluency and 24h later, subjected to 2% serum for 48h. To identify primary cilia, cells were stained for a cilia marker, Arl13b. For monitoring CP110 release, RPE cells were serum starved for 1h. Cultures of primary rat astrocytes were obtained by antibody panning from rat pups as described (Foo et al, 2011; Dhekne et al, 2018) . In brief, six to ten postnatal Sprague-Dawley rat cortices were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated to produce single cells. They were passed over successive, antibody-coated negative panning plates to rid the suspension of microglia, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells before selecting for astrocytes with an anti-ITGB5-coated plate. Astrocytes that attached to the anti-ITGB5coated plate were trypsinized and plated onto poly-D lysine coated ACLAR coverslips. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 10% CO2 and 90% O2 for one to three weeks.",

In -ATP condition, the reaction mixture of Rab10 QL and Mst3 are serially diluted, and NHS-red labeled GTD (final 100nM) is added immediately. The samples are incubated for 30min in the dark at 25\u00b0C before MST measurements are started. In all phosphorylation reactions, final concentrations of Rab10 and Mst3 were 20\u00b5M and 7\u00b5M respectively. (A) hTERT-RPE cells were transfected with HA-RILPL2 or mock transfected with lipofectamine and 24h later, serum starved overnight to initiate ciliogenesis. Cells were fixed with ice cold -20\u00b0C methanol for 2min and co-stained with rabbit anti-HA (green) or mouse anti-Arl13b (red). Arrow indicates the presence of an Arl13b + cilium. Dotted lines indicate cell outlines. Bar, 10 \u00b5m. (B) Quantitation of cells with cilia \u00b1 HA-RILPL2. Error bars represent SEM from two experiments, each with >25 cells per condition. Significance was determined by the t-test; *, p = 0.0164. (C) WT, RILPL1, and RILPL2 knockout A549 cells were plated at 80% confluency. After 24h, cells were serum starved by transfer into 2% FBS-containing medium for 48h. Cells were fixed and stained with mouse anti-Arl13b. Quantitation of cells with cilia. Error bars represent SEM from two experiments with >100 cells per condition in each experiment. #1 and #2 indicate two different A549 RILPL2 knockout clones. (D) Quantitation of cells with CP110 dots indicating capped centrioles in: (left) hTERT-RPE cells \u00b1 HA-RILPL2 for 24 h; (right) hTERT-RPE cells \u00b1 MyoVa-siRNA for 72h. Cells were serum starved for 2h, fixed with -20\u00b0C methanol for 2 min and co-stained with anti-HA, anti-CP110 or anti-CEP164/CP110. Error bars represent SEM from two experiments with >25 cells per condition in each experiment. Significance was determined by the t-test; **, p = 0.0067 and 0.0045. ",

Similarly, MyoVa-\u0394D lacking the D exon-Rab10 binding site still bound roughly the same amount of pRab10 and less total Rab10 protein(Figs. 6A,B). These experiments strongly suggest that MyoVa-\u0394D contains an additional binding site with preference for pRab10. Indeed, similar analysis of binding to the GTD domain in cell extracts(Fig. 6C) confirmed co-immunoprecipitation of Rab10 and pRab10 binding to the GTD, both of which were completely lost upon LRRK2 inhibition.",
