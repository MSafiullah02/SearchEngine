Based on the clinical symptoms and further laboratory tests (CRP 41.6 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 62 mm/60 min) (Table 1), pediatricians diagnosed severe M pneumoniae pneumonia. Intravenous azithromycin (10 mg/kg/d) was restarted, but without clinical improvement during the next 5 days, and imipenem was added on day 2 after admission because of the increasing CRP. The results of microbiological tests of the samples obtained at admission were negative for respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, coronaviruses) and some (atypical) bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila).

After 3 days in our hospital, his temperature was falling and his cough improving. After 5 days of antibiotic therapy here, no relapse (fever and cough) was observed, and his chest radiograph also showed improvement.

SOAPsnp was used to score single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from aligned reads.[16] The short reads were first aligned onto the M129 reference genome using the SOAP2 program.[17] To obtain reliable alignment hits, a maximum of 2 mismatches was allowed between the read and the reference sequence. For paired-end data, mapping locations for each read were restricted to sites within 500 bp of the mapping location of the partner sequence. For the other data, strain-specific SNPs were manually reviewed by taking into account whether SNPs were detected by MAUVE. We used BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator) to show the similarity between a reference sequence M129 and the 2 isolate sequences as concentric rings.[18] Finally, we designed PCR primers for assays to join the scaffolds using an ABI-3730 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

However, the girl, Case 1, had severe M pneumoniae pneumonia with longer-lasting fever and cough, which only improved after the second course of azithromycin. In contrast, the boy, Case 2, had mild M pneumoniae pneumonia, which only required 3 days of macrolide treatment. In previous studies, severe M pneumoniae pneumonia patients have been shown to exhibit higher CRP (CRP >40 mg/L) and ESR (ESR >30 mm/h) than normal, and these parameters were considered a useful marker for predicting the efficacy of macrolides and helping clinicians make better clinical decisions in children with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae infection.[19] In this study, Case 1 had severe M pneumoniae pneumonia with an ESR of 62 mm/h, whereas Case 2 had mild M pneumoniae pneumonia with an ESR of 28 mm/h. This result was consistent with previous reports: the value of ESR may be helpful for early identification of severe M pneumoniae pneumonia in children. In contrast, they had the same trend of change in CRP, which was different from previous studies.[19,20]",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the observation that isolates from patients were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, even though the patients had markedly different courses of disease. First, although resistant to macrolide antibiotics, the MIC value for azithromycin of the isolate from Case 2, with milder disease, was lower than that of Case 1, with more severe disease. Second, the inflammatory response to M pneumoniae infection may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of clinical disease; the girl, Case 1, with more severe disease, had previously (4 years prior) developed asthma, from which she fully recovered; but in the year preceding this infection she had recurrent respiratory tract infections, suggesting that her immune system may be somewhat depressed. Third, Case 1 also had a mixed infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which may have increased the severity of her illness. Fourth, although isolates from both patients belonged to type 1 according to traditional P1 typing, the MLVA type of Case 1 was type 5-3-5-6-2, and Case 2 was 6-3-5-6-2, differing only at the Mpn1 locus. It is not known whether variability at the Mpn1 locus is associated with severity of disease and no conclusion can be reached based on the number of cases in the present study. Last, but most importantly, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the main differences between the 2 isolates were in hypothetical proteins and adhesin P1. The P1 protein plays an important role in the attachment to human respiratory epithelial cells, and is involved in pathogenicity of M pneumoniae, so mutations in this protein may change the virulence of M pneumoniae strains.[21\u201324] We speculate that identification of mutations in the P1 protein could aid in distinguishing severe from mild disease after infection with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae. As the function of the hypothetical proteins is unknown, we cannot rule out that mutations in these hypothetical proteins could also affect disease severity.",

In a healthy child with a macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae infection, azithromycin still showed a favorable clinical and microbiological response. However, a patient with related primary diseases, like asthma or immunodeficiency disease, may have severe pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae, azithromycin may have a poor effect and need several rounds of treatment, or other avenues of treatment may need to be explored. Knowledge of the health history of patients is thus very important for the ability to predict the severity of the disease at the early stages, and early diagnosis of severe macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae is crucial for the best management of these patients.",
