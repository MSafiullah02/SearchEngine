Transbronchial and transtracheal endoscopic ultrasound allows the operator to visualize intramural/submucosal lesions and lesions in adjacent mediastinal compartments that are not detected and not accessible by other techniques, due to their location or their size [78] . Most of these lesions can reliably be evaluated by EUS-FNAB. The same technique is applied for transesophageal ultrasound-based minimally invasive morphologic investigation of disorders located adjacent to the esophagus, in the dorsal mediastinal space, and in dorsal regions and the upper lobes of the lung [22, 99, 109] . Transbronchial, transtracheal and transesophageal EUS-FNAB has become an important tool for staging lung cancer at the time of diagnosis and for assessing diagnosis on otherwise undiagnosed pulmonary and mediastinal masses.

Monocytes travel throughout the body in the circulatory system of blood. When needed, circulatory monocytes move into tissue, where they become macrophages. Another mechanism of accumulation of alveolar macrophages is hypothesized by increased local proliferation [90] . Alveolar macrophages serve as the front line of cellular defense against respiratory pathogens, clearing the air spaces of infectious, toxic, or allergic particles and ingesting carbon and other inhaled substances [88] . An alveolar macrophage is a mononuclear cell with a high phagocytic capacity on the epithelial surface of lung alveoli. The presence of this cell type in sputum indicates adequacy of the specimen submitted for microscopic evaluation. Phagocytized material in the cytoplasm of AMs: The most common material is carbon. In cases of lipid pneumonia, however, AMs exhibit large sharply outlined vacuoles containing fat [50] . The startling cell size and cytoplasmic structure of fat-laden macrophages may overlap with cytologic features of clear cell adenocarcinoma or liposarcoma. However, the AM nuclei are bland and mucus cannot be identified either. Immunocytochemical studies can confirm the cell type in cases with ambiguous cytomorphology (CD68 positivity versus negativity for cytokeratins and other epithelial markers). Phagocytosis of hemosiderin is a sign of previous blood discharge into the alveolar space. Hemosiderin pigments appear as large roundish or square aggregates that are refractile and greenish or rusty colored. For greater detail on hemosiderin pigment, see Sect. 2.3.4.8, \"Alveolar Hemorrhage Syndrome,\" p. 184.",

Therefore, asbestos use has been banned in most developed countries but exposure still occurs, and asbestosis deaths are not expected to decrease sharply in the United States during the next couple of years [2] . z z Pathogenesis, including associated immunological mechanisms of asbestosis, quantitation using the asbestos body filtration technique, and its clinical implication are highlighted in Costabel's atlas [10] .

The latter exhibit irregularly outlined nuclei, usually blurred nucleoli, and cytoplasmic bodies that are highly variable in size (direct smear, MGG stain, higher magnification). Epithelial thymocytes stained immunocytochemically positive for pancytokeratin Lu-5 (not shown). Cytologic diagnosis: Thymoma. Tissue diagnosis (tumor excision): Cortical thymoma. A 49-year-old man presented with a retrosternal tumor mass (anterior/superior mediastinum) associated with pleural and pericardial effusion. Image-guided transthoracic FNAB was performed.

Cytomorphology and diagnostic challenge are discussed. Fig. 2.102 (case #1) Dissociated atypical cells exhibiting distinct variation in nuclear and cytoplasmic size (direct smear, MGG stain, high magnification). Cytology as a first-line diagnostic procedure established a diagnosis of epithelial thymoma, which turned out to be wrong. Absence of lymphocytes, pronounced variation of cell size, occasional plasmacytoid cell appearance (arrows), conspicuous granularity of the cytoplasm, frequent absence of nucleoli, and minor cellular clustering indicate endocrine origin of the neoplastic cells. Tissue diagnosis (extirpation of the tumor): Thymic carcinoid tumor. Fig. 2.103 (case #2) The current case of thymic carcinoid mimics the cytoarchitecture of an undifferentiated small-cell carcinoma (e.g., single-file cell arrangement and dense cell clustering; left). However, the tumor cell sheet (arrow) displays the characteristic features of a neuroendocrine tumors: eccentrically located nuclei, relatively bland nuclear texture, and granular cytoplasm (direct smear, Pap stain, lower magnification). Cytologic and subsequent histologic diagnosis: Thymic carcinoid. Fig. 2.104 Embryonal carcinoma. A 26-year-old man presenting with a voluminous mediastinal mass and nodular lesions in the liver. Transthoracic FNAB reveals the characteristic cumulative cell pattern of embryonal carcinoma: syncytial arrangement of pleomorphic neoplastic cells, abundant cytoplasms showing indistinct borders, variable N/C ratio, and varying nuclear size and shape. The chromatin tends to be coarse and clumped. Occasional prominent nucleoli. Multinucleation is frequent (direct smear, Pap stain, lower magnification). Immunocytochemistry revealed strong expression of pancytokeratin-Lu-5 (not shown). Cytologic diagnosis: Undifferentiated pleomorphic carcinoma, most likely embryonal carcinoma. Final diagnosis (extended pneumonectomy including tumor mass and imaging results): Undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma of the mediastinum infiltrating into the right lung, secondary liver tumors. Fig. 2.105 Hodgkin lymphoma: mixed cellularity. A 21-year-old man presented with a tumor mass in the anterior superior mediastinal space. Direct smears from a CT-guided transthoracic FNAB disclosed the classical cytologic pattern of mixed cellular variant Hodgkin lymphoma. Note the mixed cellular background (lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes), Reed-Sternberg cells, and Hodgkin cells (MGG stain, lower magnification). Fig. 2.106 Hodgkin lymphoma: nodular sclerosis. A 26-year-old woman presented with a mediastinal-parasternal tumor mass with evidence of sternal bone and rib erosion. Image-guided transthoracic FNAB was performed. A direct smear of the paucicellular aspirate was prepared and Pap-stained. Microscopy revealed sporadic HRS cells (one Reed-Sternberg cell is depicted) together with scarce inflammatory background (low magnification). The smear with a paucity of cells may indicate a lesion comprising a high proportion of fibrosclerotic tissue. Tentative cytologic diagnosis: Malignant lesion comprising giant cells, most likely Hodgkin lymphoma. The FNA specimen is too paucicellular to provide a conclusive diagnosis. Tissue diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis, G1. Transthoracic FNAB of a mediastinal tumor in a young woman. Direct smears revealed small and large malignant cells sometimes arranged in compact clusters (Pap stain, higher magnification).

Tumorous mediastinal lesions such as tumors of the thymus, lymph nodes, ganglia, soft tissue, and others have gained interest in recent years not only to surgical pathologists, but also, to a great extent, to cytopathologists. z z Metastases are the largest category of mediastinal neoplasms diagnosed by FNAB followed by primary mediastinal tumors. Metastases usually present minor cytodiagnostic difficulties and ancillary immunocytochemical studies are helpful in assessing primary tumor location.

Proximity of major vessels and deep-seated small lesions are major technical reasons for inadequate sampling, whereas necrosis and fibrosis are biological factors responsible for limited cellularity in aspirate smears. Bloody specimens are a third reason for inadequate cytological results. z z High specificity and sensitivity have been achieved when an experienced cytopathologist or cytotechnologist is on site to ensure the adequacy of the sample [5, 20] . Immediate on-site cytologic interpretation is an additional factor that can improve diagnostic outcome [20, 92] , but this setting is very time-consuming for cytopathologists and impracticable in a majority of institutions.z z Ancillary tests such as cytochemical staining, immunocytochemistry, and molecular pathology are helpful in increasing the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB samples. Scant cellularity, poor preservation of cellular material, and blood-rich specimens are limiting factors in this respect. Special stains are particularly useful in the presence of inflammatory lesions in order to visualize organisms, such as bacteria (Gram), mycobacteria (Ziehl-Neelsen), and fungi (periodic acid-Schiff and Crocott-Gomori methenamine-silver stain). Immunocytochemical work-up of neoplastic mediastinal masses is essential in order to confirm and subclassify primary neoplasms, and to assess the primary origin of metastases [80] . FNAB may also provide material for microbiological tests (including culture) and molecular genetic analyses. [85] Modern fiberoptic equipment enables the operator to visualize parabronchial-situated nodules molding the wall of the tracheobronchial tree. The needle is passed through the fiber-endoscope and precisely inserted through the bronchial or tracheal wall into enlarged parabronchial, hilar, and paratracheal lymph nodes.",

However, the organ never completely disappears but commonly becomes cystic. z z The thymus plays an important role for the immune system and produces several hormones. Primarily undifferentiated lymphocytes -migrated from bone marrow -acquire characteristics of T cells in close contact with thymic epithelium and its microenvironment. After migration to peripheral lymphoid organs the post-thymic precursor T cells finally acquire the characteristics of mature immunocompetent T cells. The process is triggered by thymic hormones. z z The thymus is located in the anterior mediastinum but small ectopic islands of thymic tissue are found throughout the mediastinal space and are extramediastinal as well.

Furthermore, CD205 and Foxn1 have been proposed as a sensitive and specific marker for benign and malignant thymoma. The sensitivity of CD205 seems to be lower than CD5 and CD117 for thymic carcinoma, and Foxn1 was found to be superior Flow Cytometry Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the lymphoid cell population may be helpful in preoperative diagnosis of thymomas, excluding benign thymic tissue and other types of thymic tumors [78] . CD4/CD8 coexpression on the lymphocytes in thymic tumors assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis is an additional indicator for the diagnosis of thymoma [27, 28, 70, 114] . Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis on the lymphocytic population appears to be useful to determine the malignant potential of thymomas [62, 114] . Enzyme Immunoassay in Cystic Fluids Elevated CA-125 content in the fluid obtained from a cystic mediastinal tumor may be helpful in classifying the lesion as thymoma [76] .Differential Diagnosis [28, 80] The most frequent differential diagnoses of thymomas are listed next, together with immunocytochemical markers proved to be the most helpful: z z Thymomas with a dominant epithelioid component may be confused with \u2212 Primary mediastinal neoplasms: germinomas, embryonal carcinoma (placental alkaline phosphatase +), thymic carcinoid (neuroendocrine markers +); admixture of a lymphoid cell population may occur, particularly with germ cell tumors (seminoma/dysgerminoma). \u2212 Any metastatic carcinoma and melanoma (melanomatypical markers +) to the mediastinum. TTF-1 may be expressed immunocytochemically in pulmonary adenocarcinomas but not in thymoma cells [77] . \u2212 Thyroid papillary carcinoma (TTF-1 and thyroglobulin +) if the nuclei of a thymoma exhibit pale chromatin, small nucleoli, nuclear crowding and cytoplasmic invaginations [51, 67] . \u2212 Lymphocyte-rich thymoma that contains numerous transformed lymphoid elements of the B phenotype (benign lymphoblasts) may be mistaken for large-cell B-type non-Hodgkin lymphoma infiltrating the thymus gland [25, 115] . \u2212 A small-cell lymphoid infiltrate may simulate lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a disease that affects predominantly children and young adults. The vast majority of these tumors are of T-cell lineage. Caution z z Primaries in remote organs metastasizing to the thymic gland and mediastinum must be unambiguously excluded before assessing a diagnosis of primary thymic carcinoma by cytology . The peak incidence of thymic carcinoids is in the fifth decade and is more frequent in male patients. Endocrine disorders are observed in about half of the patients afflicted with thymic carcinoid [50] . z z In contrast to thymomas, thymic carcinoids do not present with an explicit encapsulation, they are frequently invasive to adjacent structures, and show frequent metastases to regional lymph nodes and distant organs. Thymic carcinoid has an overall poor prognosis [65] . Focal hemorrhage and necrosis, but not cystic degeneration, may be present. ",

Cells of carcinoid tumors may share morphologic features with epithelioid cells of thymomas, but the frequent occurrence of pyknotic cells in carcinoids mimicking lymphocytes seems to be the main reason for misdiagnosis between carcinoid tumor and thymoma [83] . Immunocytochemical reactivity for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56) should help in the correct assignment of a thymic carcinoid tumor [101] ; however, positivity for neuroendocrine markers is occasionally achieved in thymic carcinomas as well. Further immunostainings that may be helpful to distinguish thymoma from carcinoid tumor are p63 and CK5/6 (positive on thymoma and thymic carcinoma, negative on carcinoids) and CD5. CD5 yields a positive reaction in half of the thymic carcinomas and is suitable in distinguishing poorly differentiated carcinoids [83] . z z Adenocarcinomas represent characteristic cytomorphologic features including single cells, compact spherical and acinar clusters, large eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, thinly dispersed chromatin, and usually a low N/C ratio. Certain monomorphic adenocarcinomas of the gra-nular cell type may provoke differential diagnosis problems, such as metastasis of renal cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma (among others).
