Phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein is thought to regulate many of these events although precise roles remain unclear. Coronaviruses are a group of positive strand RNA viruses which cause principally respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections and include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Peiris et al., 2004) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Cavanagh, 2005).",

            "text": "Coronavirus genomes are approximately 30 kb in length, making them the largest RNA genomes so far discovered. Both RNA replication and mRNA transcription occur in virus infected cells and a series of subgenomic mRNA molecules are synthesized by the viral replicase via a discontinuous transcription mechanism (Enjuanes et al., 2006a, Pasternak et al., 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007), in which a viral leader sequence, derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, is added to the 5\u2032 end of each subgenomic mRNA (Masters, 2006). Adjacent to the leader sequence is a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) which also precedes each open reading frame along the genome. Genetic analysis suggests that the TRS and flanking sequences are involved in the modulation of transcription (Alonso et al., 2002, Hiscox et al., 1995, Sola et al., 2005, Van Marle et al., 1995, Zuniga et al., 2004). The TRS has been shown to act as a high affinity binding site for the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein suggesting a role for N protein in transcription (Baric et al., 1988, Nelson et al., 2000, Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a, Stohlman et al., 1988). Although replication can take place without N protein it does so at reduced efficiency (Almazan et al., 2004, Schelle et al., 2005). Furthermore N protein has been shown to co-localize with coronavirus replication complexes in the cytoplasm at early points post-infection (Denison et al., 1999, Van der Meer et al., 1999). Moreover, N protein is required for the efficient rescue of coronavirus genomic RNA from cDNA clones (Almazan et al., 2004, Coley et al., 2005, Schelle et al., 2005, Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2003) and has been shown to be essential for the rescue of IBV using at least two different types of reverse genetics systems (Britton et al., 2005, Casais et al., 2001, Youn et al., 2005a, Youn et al., 2005b).",

By amino acid sequence comparison coronavirus N proteins can be separated into three regions of conserved homology (Parker and Masters, 1990). Situated within these regions are motifs which play a role in both aspects of virus biology. For example, IBV N protein contains an RNA binding site (Tan et al., 2006), a nucleolar localization signal (Reed et al., 2006) and a nuclear export signal (Reed et al., 2007). These latter two signals modulate its dynamic trafficking (Cawood et al., 2007) between the cytoplasm (the site of viral RNA synthesis) and the nucleolus, suggesting a nucleolar aspect to the virus life cycle (Hiscox, 2007).",

This latter stage being similar to the recognition of the hantavirus vRNA panhandle by its nucleocapsid protein (Mir et al., 2006) or the interaction of HIV-1 Rev protein with loop A (Greatorex et al., 2006). Again, similar to the ability of the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (Mir and Panganiban, 2006), the coronavirus N protein has also been shown to have RNA chaperone activity (Zuniga et al., 2007).",

Although coronavirus N proteins were predicted to be phosphorylated at multiple serine residues, mass spectroscopic analyses identified two regions of phosphorylation on the IBV N protein (when over-expressed) which are located at two conserved amino acid clusters, Ser190 and Ser192 and Thr378 and Ser379 (Chen et al., 2005). The protein was heterogeneously phosphorylated with the predominant species having all four sites occupied (Chen et al., 2005), which reflects the mobility of IBV N protein (detected using western blot) during infection, in which a single N protein species is observed (Dove et al., 2006). Similarly the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), N protein was also found to be phosphorylated at two clusters, amino acids Ser156, Ser254 and Ser256 (Calvo et al., 2005). The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus N protein is phosphorylated at Ser170, Thr177, Ser389, Ser424 and Thr428 (White et al., 2007). Although the precise sites have not been mapped, the SARS-CoV N protein is thought to be phosphorylated at serine residues (Surjit et al., 2005). Thus for IBV and MHV N proteins these phosphate groups are located in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein, and overall the IBV, TGEV and MHV analyses demonstrate that coronavirus N proteins are phosphorylated but not at multiple (< 10) serine residues which was once accepted dogma based upon prediction analysis.",

Plasmid pTriExIBVN had previously been used to make a recombinant baculovirus for expressing phosphorylated IBV N protein in Sf9 cells (referred here as NSSTS) (Chen et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2002). Previous mass spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that N protein expressed in insect cells had identical post-translational modifications to that produced in a cell line (Vero) permissive to virus infection (Chen et al., 2005). A similar approach was used in this study to generate recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of modified IBV N proteins. The baculoviruses were used to express modified N proteins in which either Ser190 and Ser192 (NAATS) or Thr378 and Ser379 (NSSAA) were substituted for the amino acid alanine resulting in a partially phosphorylated IBV N protein. A third recombinant baculovirus was produced that expressed a modified N protein in which all four amino acids were substituted for alanine resulting in a non-phosphorylated (NAAAA) form of the IBV N protein. The NAAAA protein was used in place of E. coli expressed N protein (non-phosphorylated protein) to ensure that any additional post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, were present.",

            "text": "In many cases phosphorylation of a capsid protein has been shown to be involved in regulating RNA binding and in general two different mechanisms may be in operation. In the first case phosphorylation through altering charge may affect binding affinity. For example, dephosphorylation of the rubella virus capsid protein increases its binding affinity for viral RNA and specific phosphorylation sites are involved in the process (Law et al., 2003). This is also the case for IBV N protein where non-phosphorylated N protein can bind viral RNA with higher affinity than phosphorylated protein, but at the expense of specificity. Likewise, phosphorylation has been proposed to reduce the electrostatic interaction with target RNA, as in the case of the binding of potato virus A coat protein to RNA (Ivanov et al., 2001). Given the binding differences between NAATS protein and NSSAA protein for viral RNA it can be concluded that overall negative charge is not contributing to binding, otherwise the two proteins would have equivalent binding kinetics. Both of these proteins had identical motilities as determined by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Fig. 1), and again mass spectroscopy confirmed their phosphorylation status with two phosphorylated sites.",

            "text": "An alternative mechanism is that phosphorylation can affect the conformation of a protein with a corresponding effect on RNA binding properties, as in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein, where the phosphorylation of one or two serine residues can cause the closure of an RNA binding cleft in the protein (Fouts et al., 1997). Similarly, phosphorylation of the duck hepatitis B virus capsid protein causes a conformational change in the C-terminal region of the protein (Yu and Summers, 1994). In order to determine whether there were any major conformational differences in the N protein structures between the modified forms of the N proteins either following loss of the phosphate group from substitution of the Ser or Thr amino acids with Ala, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the conformational states of the four N proteins. CD spectroscopy results in the detection of changes in the overall secondary structure of a protein. CD spectroscopic measurements were taken in the far UV (180\u2013260 nm) spectra. This was repeated three times for all four proteins with different protein samples used in each separate experiment. The HT reading was taken along side all measurements to ensure that the signal to noise ratio remained below the level at which data could be considered reliable. An example of a CD spectrum obtained for all four proteins with the average HT reading for all four proteins is shown in Fig. 4\n. The resulting data (above a wavelength of 195 nm) indicated that the differing phosphorylation patterns did not result in different overall secondary structures, as judged by the similarity of the four CD readings produced. The spectra of all four proteins remained below the axis for the majority of the reading, with a major trough occurring between 200 and 210 nm. One subtle difference that can be observed is that the CD trace of both the partially phosphorylated proteins remained slightly closer to the x-axis (i.e. less negative) between 250 and 200 nm than the same region of the fully and non-phosphorylated proteins. Despite this difference in magnitude of the CD signals, the general shapes of the spectrum remain similar. Moreover, the trend of remaining negative and evoking a major trough peaking at approximately 208 nm was the same as observed in the far CD spectrum of IBV N protein expressed and purified from E. coli (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a).",

As for previous analysis (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a) the CDDSTR (a Fortran program (Johnson, 1999)) provided the best fitting data, as judged by the low normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) values and close agreement between the experimental and reconstructed spectra. As such, data estimated by this method were used to compare the structures of differentially phosphorylated N proteins (Table 2\n). The data indicated that all four proteins were made up of a large proportion of \u03b2 structures, with \u03b2-sheets and turns accounting for over 50% of the secondary structure. The proteins contained an average of 20% \u03b1-helix with the remaining 26\u201327% being comprised of random coil structures, again these are consistent with those estimations of secondary structure for (non-phosphorylated) N protein expressed in E. coli (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006a). The Student's t-test revealed that any difference between the secondary structure elements of the differentially phosphorylated B proteins was not significant (data not shown). These proportions are in approximate agreement with the solid state structure for the N and C-terminal regions of IBV N protein (Jayaram et al., 2006).",

N protein is essential for the successful rescue of IBV using at least two different types of reverse genetics systems (Britton et al., 2005, Casais et al., 2001, Youn et al., 2005a, Youn et al., 2005b). Recovery of infectious IBV was repeatedly found to be unsuccessful in the absence of the IBV N protein or from the use of an IBV N gene that lacked the correct initiation codon for the N protein. However, infectious IBV was rescued via co-transfection of plasmid DNA expressing either IBV NSSTS, NSSAA, NAATS or NAAAA (pCi-NeoIBVNSSTS, pCi-NeoIBVNSSAA, pCi-NeoIBVNAATS and pCi-NeoIBVNAAAA, respectively) and vaccinia virus DNA containing a full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter sequence in chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The rescue experiments were repeated three times. The amounts of progeny virus rescued in the transfected cells were determined by plaque assay, as an approximate determination of the efficiency of rescue, and related to input plasmid, generating a numerical output of infectious units per \u03bcg of input plasmid. All of the modified N proteins resulted in the rescue of infectious IBV, indicating that phosphorylation of the IBV N protein is not required for this biological activity. However, analysis of the rescue of infectious IBV indicated that the IBV N proteins NSSTS, NSSAA, NAATS and NAAAA, generated 3200 \u00b1 154, 25 \u00b1 6, 680 \u00b1 17 and 68 \u00b1 9 infectious units per \u03bcg of input plasmid, respectively.",

These residues are located in the C-terminal region of the protein, the structure of which has been partially solved by X-ray crystallography using the Gray strain of IBV (Jayaram et al., 2006). Unfortunately, the portion of the protein for which the structure was solved encompasses residues 219 to 349 inclusive. The Thr378 and Ser379 residues lay outside of this fragment, and as such their position on the three dimensional model cannot be mapped. However, this region of the protein is reported to be stable and to contain a number of conserved residues (Jayaram et al., 2006), for example a nuclear export signal (Reed et al., 2007) which is shared with the SARS-CoV N protein (You et al., 2007). The Ser190 and Ser192 residues lie within the central region of the protein, the structure of which has not been elucidated. This region of the protein has been reported as intrinsically highly disordered (Enjuanes et al., 2006b, Jayaram et al., 2006) and as such difficult to purify and perform structural analysis. The observation that phosphorylation of residues in this disordered region has less of an effect on RNA binding ability than those in the structured C-terminal region indicates that the central region of the protein may indeed be unstructured and that changes, such as phosphorylation, have little effect on the function in this part of the protein.",

This plasmid served as template for the generation of plasmids that when expressed would lead to phosphorylation mutants of N protein. Specific mutations were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit. Three plasmids were generated pTriExIBVNSSAA, pTriExIBVNAATS and pTriExIBVNAAAA, which lead to the replacement of Thr378 and Ser379 with alanine, Ser190 and Ser192 with alanine and Ser190, Ser192, Thr378 and Ser379 with alanine, respectively. Primer sequences are available on request. All constructs were sequenced in both directions. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by transfecting Sf9 cells with the plasmids expression vector (which contained segments of baculovirus genomic DNA) and BacVector-3000 Triple Cut Virus DNA (Novagen). After transfection, monolayers were plaque assayed and candidate plaques individually purified by re-plaquing. Virus was harvested from subsequent plaques and used to infect exponentially growing cultures of Sf9 cells.

The cloning of wild-type N protein into pCi-Neo (in this study referred to as pCi-NeoIBVNSSTS) has been described previously (Hiscox et al., 2001).",

Vaccinia virus DNA, containing the full-length IBV cDNA, and the plasmid expressing the IBV N genes are co-transfected into chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase from the recombinant fowlpox virus results in the synthesis of infectious IBV RNA from the vaccinia virus DNA. The IBV RNA acts as an mRNA for the synthesis of the IBV replicase proteins, resulting in replication of the IBV RNA and generation of the subgenomic mRNAs for translation of the structural proteins and assembly of infectious virus progeny. The expression of IBV N protein from the co-transfected plasmid is required to initiate this process by an as yet unknown mechanism.",
