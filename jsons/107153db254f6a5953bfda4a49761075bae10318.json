This is a comment on the recent work published by Wang et al.: the first report compiling epidemiologic data from COVID 19 and Diabetes [1]. As we understand there is an urgent need to publish the facts and statistics of this everyday changing pandemic and in an effort to reporting and informing the medical community real-time, erroneous conclusions might be generated. Consequently, the public and healthcare providers might have wrong assumptions and misleading interpretations. In this commentary, we highlight some of the limitations and flaws we identified and thereafter, we summarize what we already know from previous published data on diabetes and sepsis. This communication should also serve as call for expedited well-designed epidemiologic and interventional studies, only then, factual conclusions could be drawn.",

            "text": "The first problem we find on this report is that conclusions are driven from small cohorts. The denominator is 1102 when he mentions incidence of diabetes (7.3%). When he reports mortality in patients with no diabetes (0.9%) the denominator is 15,536, this is a much larger cohort. We would need to know the exact prevalence of diabetes in the largest cohort to make a more precised comparison. Besides that, when the report compares how many patients required care in the ICU ( Intensive Care Unit) vs. how many patients did not require care in ICU care, the denominator of cohort is even smaller:138.",

            "text": "Another limitation we identify is the lack of clinical information to be able to perform risk stratification within the diabetic population. We do not have information about diabetes duration, time of diagnoses; at times, patients newly diagnosed with diabetes have stress-induced hyperglycemia, those patients, based on previous data, have the poorest outcomes when they become septic. In this report the type of diabetes is not specified, we know Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes are very different entities. Clinical characteristics at baseline are not presented including medications and comorbidities. Either diabetes control prior to admission was not mentioned neither glycemic control, treatment and management in the inpatient setting (i.e implementation of insulin protocols or availability of an inpatient diabetes team) Lastly, and in my opinion, a very important factor to mention and probably one of the main factors driving morbidity and mortality would be the availability of appropriate resources at the time of each patient' hospitalization, Was the healthcare system already saturated and overwhelmed? https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108138 0168-8227/\u00d3 2020 Elsevier B.V.

There is preclinical data in animal models proven a dysfunction of the immune system (humoral and cellular) and there is an abnormal inflammatory state in patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. There is an increased susceptibility for patients with diabetes to have an infection. 2. Hyperglycemia is an important factor for patients with diabetes that influence sepsis incidence and course. 3. Hyperglycemia is also and important prognostic factor when patients have sepsis and do not have diabetes. 4. We do not know if certain medications worsen or improve these outcomes with the exception of insulin. Insulin therapy has been demonstrated in previous data to decrease inflammation, on the other hand clinical studies have found that too intense glycemic control is detrimental to our patients in the ICU, especially in patients in medical ICUs compared with patients in Surgical ICU units. 5. Hypoglycemia is detrimental to critically ill patients 6. Hypoglycemia is a negative prognostic factor for critical ill patients",
