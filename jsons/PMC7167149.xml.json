In Peru, respiratory infections are a major healthcare problem, especially in children under 5 years of age, with over 2.2 million infants being treated for this group of infectious diseases annually. The most affected areas are Lima East, Callao, Moquegua, Arequipa, and Ucayali, where a cumulative incidence as high as 19,783, and eight episodes per 10,000 children, was reported in 2013 [Gomez et al., 2013].",

In May that year, the first influenza A (H1N1) case was confirmed. The pandemic rapidly spread throughout the country and affected primarily the 5\u201314 age group, with more than 80% of the cases being reported in Lima [Munayco et al., 2009]. Surveillance of the pandemic in Peru provided valuable information about its behavior in a developing southern hemisphere country, with over 8,000 confirmed cases until September 2009. This figure represents a 4% increase in acute respiratory infections [Gomez et al., 2009]. However, information about etiological agents of viral respiratory infections in Peru is still limited. Active surveillance is therefore essential to identify the causative agents and improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses [Schoub, 2006; Ren et al., 2009].",

Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of illnesses in children, including pharyngitis, otitis media, laryngitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. This broad presentation of viral respiratory infections makes it difficult to clinically identify their etiology [Van Woensel et al., 2003]. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis tool is essential for suitable therapeutic interventions [Barenfanger et al., 2000].",

Viral culture and isolation is considered the gold standard, but this high\u2010cost, elaborated technique is usually performed for research purposes. Antigen detection tests, such as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, are more commonly used because of their lower cost and rapid results, but often lack sensitivity or specificity. Furthermore, these tests produce false negatives in a high percentage of cases [Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005]. Molecular techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Among them, PCR has shown to be the most sensitive and specific in detection of respiratory infectious agents, including samples with low copy number [van Elden et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2006; Van de Pol et al., 2007].",

Compared to conventional diagnostic tests, like Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA), PCR increases diagnostic yields of respiratory virus detection from 24% to 43% of cases [Turner et al., 2013]. Therefore, PCR is the laboratory surveillance method of choice [Barenfanger et al., 2000; van Elden et al., 2002; Mahony et al., 2007; Van de Pol et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2014]. The above figures are consistent with our study results, which show that respiratory viral detection increases from 11.9%, by DFA to 33.5%, by PCR (Table II). However, limited data are available regarding clinical presentation and strains of these viruses in Latin America [Sovero et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2013; Grassi et al., 2014]. The prevalence of these pathogens is underestimated due to lack of rapid and proper virus identification tools in many areas [Alonso et al., 2012]. In Peru, respiratory virus surveillance has been conducted in 28 hospitals around the country since 2012. Samples of acute respiratory infection patients are analyzed by DFA and only influenza positive cases are subjected to PCR detection [Tejada, [Link]]. Furthermore, collected data remain unpublished and few studies have been undertaken about circulating respiratory viruses in the last 5 years, especially concerning specific viral etiology detection (although a few more on viral surveillance can be found) [Forshey et al., 2010; Padilla\u2010Ygreda et al., 2010; Salm\u00f3n\u2010Mulanovich et al., 2011; Budge et al., 2014a].",

Influenza virus was also the second most frequent etiology detected in our samples: influenza A in 4.6% and influenza B and C in only 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively (Table V). Influenza A was more common in children under 10 years old, with 16% of cases.

However, comparison of PIV\u20101 incidence between Piura (Peru) and Fortaleza (Brazil), located at only 2\u00b0N, showed differences in distribution, suggesting that seasonality may be associated with temperature rather than distance from the Equator [Villaran et al., 2014]. In contrast, a constant, rather than seasonal, incidence was observed for PIV\u20101 in the Lima study whereas a higher incidence was reported during autumn for RSV\u2010A, with more than 50% of cases detected, especially during May\u2013June in 2009 and March\u2013April in 2010.
