It is yet unpredictable when to expect improvement in the COVID-19 situation, but this will also require a scenario for progressive resumption of medical care.

Stage 3: Still perform surgery for urgent cases in which delay will cause irreversible progression of disease or organ damage: -Pyeloplasty in UPJ obstruction with progressive loss of differential function or severe symptoms. Consider postponing reconstruction and draining the kidney by JJ catheter or nephrostomy depending on local situation. -Posterior urethral valves (PUV). -Obstructed megaureter with progressive loss of differential function. -Urolithiasis with recurring febrile infections Stage 4 Perform surgery only in cases of organ-threatening or life-threatening disease:-Urosepsis with obstruction: e.g. urosepsis with urolithiasis, obstructing ureterocele, or obstructed megaureter. -Trauma with hemodynamic instability (endovascular or surgical procedures) or urinary leakage.",
