            "text": "The photocatalytic process is now well known and recognized as an efficient method to remove organic pollutants present in aqueous phase such as pesticides, dyes or in gaseous phase such as volatile organic compounds (VOC) [1]. Several industrial reactors are now commercialized for this type of application [2]. Main researches concerned water treatment or removal of pollutants, but disinfection was few studied. Photocatalytic oxidation as a technique for microbial disinfection was first demonstrated by Matsunaga et al. [3] using TiO2/Pt as a catalyst. Blake [4] and Fujishima [5] provide a review of the application of TiO2 photocatalysis to disinfection. Since 2000, Pulgarin's team thoroughly studied the effects of various parameters such as nature of support, nature of photocatalyst, light power and initial concentration on the photocatalytic efficiency [6], [7], [8]. In gas phase, the studies are very scarce. The pioneering work in the field of gas-phase photocatalytic disinfection was done by Goswami et al. [9], [10]. He developed a recirculating duct facility to completely inactivate biological contaminants in indoor air. Beside studies on several bacterial strains [11], [12], photocatalytic disinfection has also been carried out on microcystin toxins produced by various cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) [13], [14]. In 2004, Keller et al. [15] developed and patented [16] a photocatalytic reactor removing more than 99% of bacteria. Very few studies performed tests to prove the efficiency of photocatalytic process to remove viruses. Following the attack of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, Knight [17] studied a system, based on photocatalytic disinfection, to control the spread of infectious microorganisms such as SARS virus on flights.",

In E. coli PHL1273 strain, a gene coding for a green fluorescent protein has been incorporated in the genome in order to visualise the strain by fluorescence microscopy. This strain also carries the ompR234 mutation which increases the synthesis of curli, a particular type of fimbriae allowing the bacteria to better adhere to abiotic surfaces [18]. These curli or fimbriae should (i) improve the adsorption of bacteria on the photocatalyst and (ii) be directly in contact with the photocatalyst.",

From this result, we can see that the inactivation of both bacterial strains was similar. In our experimental conditions, it was impossible to determine whether the adhesion of E. coli 1273 on TiO2 was increased or not. With respect to the obtained results, the inactivation of both E. coli strains on TiO2 P-25 seems to be similar. However, it is difficult to imagine that the presence of more fimbriae on bacteria does not modify the inactivation. The active species generated at the surface of titania during the irradiation should be more in contact with fimbriae than with the membrane. Thus, the fimbriae should be oxidized in competition with the membrane. This hypothesis is in agreement with the measurement of ammonium cations in solution. Ammonium ions, obtained from the degradation of aminoacids present in fimbriae, were detected only in the case of E. coli PHL1273. In conclusion, the similarity of the two curves suggests that the oxidation of fimbriae does not lead to the inactivation of bacteria during this irradiation time.",

As seen in\nFig. 2, PHL1273 strain, having more fimbriae, was more quickly inactivated than PHL849 strain in the presence of PC500. To explain this result, it can be suggested that the adhesion of PHL1273 on PC500 could be stronger. But how to explain this higher adsorption while no difference is observed with titania P-25? It may be due to the more negative overall charge of PHL1273 compared to that of PHL849 strains. Moreover, if the adhesion of PHL1273 strain on PC500 was really more important than that of PHL849 on the same photocatalyst, it should be considered either that the degradation products (aldehydes, acids, ions\u2026) originating from the degradation of fimbriae participate in the inactivation of the bacteria or that the smaller particles of PC500 penetrate more easily in the membrane of PHL1273. Future studies are programmed to better understand this phenomenon.",

In the case of organic compounds, we follow mainly the disappearance of organic molecules and sometimes the mineralization. Only one modification in the structure of organic molecule leads to its disappearance, while the inactivation of a microorganism does not correspond to only one modification of an organic molecule present in the microorganism. The mechanism of inactivation is not very well understood until now. Matsunaga et al. [3] suggested that its inactivation is due to the oxidation of intracellular co-enzyme A (CoA) which inhibits the cell respiration. Other authors proposed that a significant disorder in the cell permeability (loss of ionic flow control) and decomposition of the cell walls are at the origin of their inactivation [21]. Many questions still remain misunderstood: is cellular death due to a loss of the integrity of the bacterial wall or to the oxidation of intracellular components? [22]\n",
