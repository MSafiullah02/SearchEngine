They 54 can therefore provide useful estimates of the circulation of the virus in the general population, 55 despite a possible different social behavior, especially near delivery. 56 The objective of this study was to estimate the \"true\" SARS-CoV2 infection rate among women 57 admitted for delivery and estimate the burden of undocumented infections in this population. 58 Methods 59 We studied 2 neighboring Italian Regions, North of Tuscany and Liguria, both considered at 60 medium risk of infection compared to Northern Regions. All the 6 hospitals of Azienda USL 61 \"Toscana Nord Ovest\" [ATNO] (Tuscany), and Gaslini Children's Hospital (Genoa, Liguria) began 62 screening for SARS-CoV2 between March 26 th and April 1 st by nasopharyngeal swab (real-time 63 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). 64",
