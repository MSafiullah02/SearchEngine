This property has been abundantly exploited by human communities since they invented agriculture and breeding. Our ancestors have thus generated the essential of the varieties and races available and used by human beings. These heavily selected species are used as a source of food as well as pets or ornamental plants. The transformations which occurred during genetic selection are so deep that a number of domesticated species would not survive without the assistance of humans. Silkworm which has become unable to move, to find its food and sexual partners is illustrating this fact.",

In the best cases, this leads to the generation of new lines of animals showing various abnormalities mimicking more or less human diseases.

Up to 1-3% of mouse microinjected embryos commonly become transgenic animals. This yield can be significantly enhanced by using mouse strains like FVB/ N . For unknown reasons, this yield is lower or much lower in rabbits, rats, pigs and ruminants respectively. This is not because of microinjection per se but to the integration process.

For unknown reasons, nake DNA does not integrate at a significant rate in the genome of animals like chicken, xenopus and the fish medaka. Interestingly, electroporation of medaka embryo can generate a high number of transgenes (Hostetler et al. 2003) . The integration yield may be enhanced by adding the recombinase Rec A to the DNA (Maga et al. 2003) . More impressive is the fact that fragments of interest released from plasmids inside the embryo by the meganuclease I-Sce I show a high capacity to integrate into medaka genome (Thermes et al. 2002) . The same phenomenon was observed in xenopus. The mechanism of action I-Sce I is not fully understood.

In these two situations, the targeted genomic gene is inactivated in the very early stage of embryo development. For a number of reasons, it may be preferable to delay gene knock out. This may be achieved by introducing two LoxP sites within the gene to inactivate, using conventional homologous recombination. The addition of Cre recombinase triggers elimination of the sequence located between the two LoxP sites leading to an inactivation of the targeted gene. Cre recombinase gene may be expressed only in a given tissue of the animal harbouring the gene under the control of a cell-specific promoter. Alternatively, Cre gene may be brought to a tissue of adults using adenoviral vectors.",

Transgenes must contain at least one intron which favours premRNA maturation and mature mRNA transfer to cytoplasm.

These structures are recognized as foreign elements by the cells, probably during early embryo development, and their C becomes methylated. This inactivates promoters in a manner which is reversible or not and which may be transmitted to progeny. Transgenes must be preferably integrated in a low copy number. This cannot be controlled in practice unless the gene construct contains a LoxP sites which allow elimination of transgene copies but one under the action of Cre recombinase.",

Gene studies performed essentially in human, as well as transgenesis carried out in drosophilae and mice indicated that remote sequences are required for genes to be expressed in an appropriate manner. These remote regions are known as locus control region or insulators. The study of these regulatory regions is underway in a few systems. It appears now that insulators contains several kind of elements: (i) potent enhancers which are often cell specific, (ii) enhancer blockers which prevent cross talk between neighbour genes in a genome, and (iii) chromatin openers which induce local post-translational histone modifications which allow the transcription machinery to reach the genes to be expressed.",

They may be located in a single region forming a barrier insulating a locus from its neighbours (Bell et al. 2001) . It seems however that in most, if not all cases, quite distant elements participate to the insulator effects. The regulatory elements of a gene may be separated from its promoter by one or several non-related genes. Thanks to a looping process, the distant regulatory elements associated to 272 L-M Houdebine the corresponding transcription factors move to the promoter region forming a hub which induces histone hyperacetylation and a local opening of chromatin. This allows the transcription machinery to express the gene (De Laat and Grosveld 2003) . These dynamic modifications of chromatin conformation more and more appear not only as mechanisms controlling gene expression but also as mechanisms of differentiation. The study of albumin gene illustrates this point. This gene is in closed chromatin conformation in early embryo. It becomes open specifically in endoderm and remains so until hepatocyte differentiation. It remains closed in the other differentiated cells (Lomvardas and Thanos 2002) . These phenomena were discovered and are still studied thanks to the use of transgenesis. Transgenesis is itself highly beneficial of these discoveries. Indeed, the addition of insulator elements, namely of the 5\u00a2HS4 region from the chicken b-globin locus, greatly favours expression of transgenes in vertebrates (Giraldo et al. 2003) .",

It was shown that natural antibodies already present in recipient blood before transplantation recognize antigens located at the surface of the foreign cells, particularly of the endothelial cells of the xeno-organs. This induces a quick activation of host complement which destroys the endothelial cells and provokes thrombosis followed by organ death. The major pig antigen has been identified. It is composed of carbohydrate moieties ended by the 1,3-a-galactose-1, 3-agalactose motif covalently added to a number protein present at the surface of the cells. The primates of the Old World including human have no more a functional a-galactosyl transferase gene which is responsible for the addition of a-galactose to proteins. Higher primates have natural antibodies against the 1,3-a-galactose motif. The presence of these antibodies does not result from an immunoreaction induced by the presence of the foreign cells. This is the reason why the first rejection mechanism is so fast and potent.

Flying and swimming animals may colonize vast areas on earth without any possible control. This question has been studied and discussed by Muir (2004) . This study reveals that fast-growing fish are more rapidly sexually mature than controls. They might thus invade biotopes like oceans. Excess of growth hormone fragilizes the animals and shortens their life. In a second step, the rapidly growing fish released in sea water might be responsible for a local extinction of the species. Although not very likely, this scenario cannot be ignored and, up to now, the regulation agencies did not accept the breeding of fast-growing fish using the current techniques. Complete isolation of fish farms or sterilization of the animals would solve the problem. Paradoxically, the biosafety agencies might authorize human consumption of fast-growing fish but not their breeding.",
