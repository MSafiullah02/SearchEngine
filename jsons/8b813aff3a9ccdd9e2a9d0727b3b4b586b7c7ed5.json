How our species survives in the hostile world that surrounds us has been a source of fascination since the beginning of recorded time. Injury and infection likely exacted a heavy toll as our early hominid ancestors descended from the trees and adapted a predatory life style on the African plains; death from bleeding and wound infections undoubtedly plagued early humans (Opal 2003) . Epidemic disease, however, probably played a minor role in shaping the primitive human immune system. Instead, the primary determinants of lethality for small, scattered bands of hunter-gatherer populations of Homo sapiens were starvation, predation, and hypothermia.",

Ancient examples abound -endemic camelpox in domesticated camels became human smallpox, bovine rinderpest became epidemic human measles, bovine tuberculosis became human tuberculosis, and swine influenza became human influenza. More recent historical examples include the cross-species adaptation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of non-human primates (Kalish et al. 2004 ); spongiform encephalopathy from sheep to cattle and on to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Stevens et al. 2006 ); avian influenza from water fowl (Herzog et al. 2004) ; and severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) from civet cats (Margaret et al. 2004) .",

Large population densities of humans in fixed, farming communities provided the essential substrate for efficient airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens and for a sufficient number of partner exchanges to maintain sexually transmitted diseases as well (Sherman 2007) . With the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, novel modalities succeeded in protecting human populations primarily through enhanced sanitation measures, public health efforts, and, as vaccine science evolved, through the use of vaccination.

Ancient Hebrew texts refer to \"plagues\" that beset the Pharaohs in Egypt more than 1,000 years before the birth of Christ; the Greeks and Romans each experienced cataclysmic outbreaks that had profound impacts on their respective Empires. With each of these \"plagues\" enlightened observers noted the phenomenon of resistance upon re-exposure to the same disease process. The Greek historian Thucydides recorded such observations regarding smallpox, and there is evidence that the Chinese exploited this knowledge in the sixteenth century in their practice of variolation (Leung 1996) . Much later, the intercontinental exchange of people and pathogens during the age of exploration to Africa and the New World in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries dramatized the concept that some form of \"natural resistance\" to disease was often intrinsic to native populations yet lacking in the newly exposed (Diamond 1999) . Africans, forcibly exported to America as slaves, were noted to be more resistant to tropical diseases such as yellow fever and malaria when compared to share croppers of European descent. This was most evident upon first arriving to the colonies, a process known as \"seasoning\" by landowners. European farmers died by the drove from sickness and disease in the Southern colonies, as did captured Native Americans transported from New England and elsewhere to work in the fields there and in the Caribbean (Morgan 1975) , thus furthering the African slave trade as an economic expediency for the rapid expansion of a healthy labor force.",

In 1763 Lord Jeffrey Amherst, commander of British troops in North American during the French and Indian War took this knowledge a step further, using smallpox as a biological weapon against the hostile Native American forces in Pennsylvania. Blankets were deliberately contaminated with the scabs from smallpox victims and left for the Indians in wintertime. Whether acquired from the fomites or via human-to-human transmission, smallpox devastated the Indians who had sided with the French forces, contributing to the British victory (Diamond 1999) .",

Shortly after Columbus' first return voyage in 1493, an epidemic of \"great pox\" occurred throughout much of Europe. \"Great pox\" aptly described the clinical appearance of the cutaneous lesions of secondary syphilis, in contradistinction to the familiar appearance of smallpox. While it is possible, even likely, that some of Columbus' crew contributed to the spread of syphilis throughout Europe, they were likely the vector, rather than the original source of infection. Skeletal remains found in both Britain and Greece and dated well before Columbus made his famous voyage carry the unmistakable stigmata of the osseous forms of tertiary syphilis. It is likely that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus in relatively rare and localized forms, arriving from the Mediterranean via trade routes established centuries earlier. After the defeat of the Islamic Moors in the Battle of Granada in 1492, a Papal order closed all leprosaria, institutions that probably housed numerous, misdiagnosed, syphilitic patients within their confines. Release of these highly infectious individuals, coupled with the rampant prostitution practices of the time, likely contributed to the spread of the disease across Europe. This newly recognized and highly virulent form of syphilis continued to be epidemic into the first half of the sixteenth century (Sherman 2007) .",

            "text": "Using his powers of observation and knowledge of epidemics, the Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro, or Hieronymous Fracastorius, had written a treatise on the germ theory of disease entitled \"de Contagione\" in 1546. Fracastorius correctly surmised that tiny, free-living organisms, which he referred to as \"seeds of disease,\" existed in nature. Despite being invisible to human eyes, he postulated that these disease-causing organisms could be transmitted from person-to-person directly or via fomite intermediaries, thereby spreading contagion (Gensini and Conti 2004) . He correctly surmised that syphilis was caused by such a microscopic organism. In his poem entitled \"Syphilis sive Morbus Gallicus\" (translated \"Syphilis or the French Disease\") he described in remarkably accurate, yet mythical, poetic detail the clinical consequences of syphilis (Conrad et al. 1995) . The Italians blamed syphilis on the French, hence the name \"the French Disease\"; the French on the other hand referred to it as \"the Italian Disease.\" This pattern of naming the syphilis epidemics based on local, political, or religious adversaries continued as the scourge spread throughout the western world and the Middle East (Sherman 2007) . The Dutch textile merchant and self-taught scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) is credited with first identifying microorganisms, or \"little animals,\" using his newly developed microscope in 1677, thereby confirming Fracastoro's hypothesis (Corliss 2002) . The critical significance of these tiny forms to human health was not fully appreciated until almost 200 years later when Pasteur and Koch first successfully cultured bacterial organisms from diseased tissues. Despite the technical shortcomings in the period between van Leeuwenhoek ( Fig. 3 .2) and Pasteur, a number of scientists and physicians correctly hypothesized the existence of microscopic organisms and their contribution to human disease.",

The mortality rate for puerperal or \"child bed\" fever was such that one out of ten pregnant women could be expected to die shortly after birth from this dreaded complication.

He correctly hypothesized that some form of \"putrid matter\" must be carried on the hands of physicians during their rounds between the autopsy and birthing tables and might be transmitted to pregnant women causing this highly lethal peripartum illness (Jones 1970).",

In fact the germ theory of disease was not taught in medical schools in Europe or elsewhere. Semmelweis found that washing hands using a dilute, chlorinated lime solution after performing autopsies would remove the putrid odor. Based on his empiric observations but lacking definitive proof of his hypotheses, he boldly introduced a policy whereby all medical students and faculty were required to wash their hands in this solution before having contact with patients. In 1847 Semmelweis showed that the introduction of hand washing between patient contacts reduced the mortality rate from puerperal fever by fourfold in 1 year (Wyklicky and Skopec 1983) . As seen throughout history, innovative ideas that contradict prevailing wisdom are vulnerable to immediate rejection; additionally, Semmelweis was guilty of poor timing. Although he had demonstrated the benefit of a simple intervention, it occurred at a moment of great geopolitical turmoil and was met with considerable acrimony, much of it politically motivated. He experienced profound, negative professional and personal consequences of his work. By 1848 the concept of revolution was spreading throughout Europe; within the Hapsburg Empire, of which Austria and Hungary were a part, the tenuous Dual Monarchy was at risk of crumbling under the separatist demands of Hungarian nationalists. A wave of political and social conservatism took hold in Austria. When this young, talented Hungarian faculty physician with his radical new ideas about health care came up for reappointment, he was passed over and forced to resign. He returned to Hungary where his novel prevention strategy against puerperal fever was implemented with success.",

It did not help matters that it took him over a decade to write the definitive review of his investigations into the etiology and prevention of puerperal fever and when the manuscript was finally produced in 1861, it was a rambling, confused report that convinced few of his skeptics and was roundly criticized as being poorly formulated and unscientific. Semmelweis countered with a series of harsh diatribes against his critics, essentially accusing his fellow physicians of killing their patients through negligence and intransigence to his new ideas about hand washing. His behavior in public and private became increasingly erratic; he fell into a deep melancholy eventually resulting in his involuntary commitment to an insane asylum.

In so doing he directly challenged the prevailing \"miasma theory\" that cholera and other diseases resulted from bad air. Such thought was widely accepted at the time through traditional teachings and the influential experimental work of the German chemist Max von Pettenkoffer. In 1854 a cholera outbreak occurred in London that provided compelling evidence in favor of Snow's alternative hypothesis. Snow (Fig. 3.4) carefully mapped the incident cases of cholera in the residents of downtown London and noted their proximity to public water-drawing sites. He observed that the highest incidence of disease was centered at the corner of Broad and Cambridge Streets, the site of a pumping station for drinking water. The water intake for this pump was drawn from a location just downstream of a large sewer effluent from London in the Thames River. Using interviews of cases and contacts and statistical assessments, methods that would become standard fare for future outbreak investigators but were novel at the time, Snow deduced that the infection was transmitted by contaminated water. As a result of his evidence, the handle was removed from the Broad Street pump forcing local residents to seek water from other pumping stations. The epidemic, probably already waning, was halted. Snow is appropriately credited as the founding father of the field of epidemiology based on this work. Although he microscopically examined the contaminated water supplies and observed \"small, white flocculent particles\" that he speculated were the causative agent of cholera (Johnson 2002) , he never obtained definitive microbiologic proof.",

Berkeley, a mycology expert, noted the unmistakable presence of microscopic mold elements in diseased plants in 1846. The potato blight would, over the next few years, lead to the death of one million Irish and result in the mass emigration of approximately two million of their countrymen from their homeland, never to return (Sherman 2007 ). Berkeley's observations were predictably mocked by the scientific community, as it was generally accepted at the time that the potato blight was due to cold and damp \"miasma.\" In 1861, the same year that Semmelweis wrote his now famous if flawed paper on puerperal fever, Anton de Bary, a German plant pathologist and mycologist, conclusively proved that the etiology of potato blight was in fact a fungus -Phytophthora infestans (literally meaning \"the plant destroyer\") -by essentially following the same lines of scientific reasoning that would set the standard for microbial causation two decades later in a Berlin tuberculosis laboratory.",

In 1879, Pasteur observed that after serial passage the chicken cholera bacillus, now known as Pasteurella spp., lost the capacity to cause lethality when injected into chickens. Because chickens were in short supply in the laboratory, Pasteur was forced to recycle the same animals in subsequent experiments using freshly passed and highly virulent strains of bacteria. Remarkably, the chickens previously exposed to attenuated bacilli survived infection with virulent strains, whereas na\u00efve chickens died rapidly upon challenge. He surmised that serial passage of the bacteria at certain elevated temperature ranges and in the presence of oxygen resulted in organisms that could induce resistance to challenge using virulent forms of the same bacteria.",

Robert Koch (1843-1910) studied medicine at the University at G\u00f6ttingen where he came under the influence of the notable Professor of Anatomy Jakob Henle, an early proponent of the germ theory of disease, and learned the importance of careful animal experimentation in understanding disease causation. In the 1870s, as a district medical officer in the Prussian town of Wollstein, Koch (Fig. 3.7) began his investigations into the etiology of anthrax in sheep; this marked the beginning of a distinguished career in scientific research (Brock 1988) . He identified anthrax bacilli in the blood of infected sheep and successfully transmitted the infection into healthy experimental animals. Using careful photomicroscopy and detailed drawings, he accurately described the life cycle of anthrax and the process of endospore formation. With the publication of this work in 1876, Koch became a major force in the fledgling field of microbiology.",

Using differential staining techniques, careful microscopy, and solid agar methods, Koch isolated the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in pure culture (Dubos and Dubos 1956) . It was in this context that he initially proposed a set of criteria that had to be satisfied to infer an etiologic role for a specific bacterial agent in a particular disease. These conditions came to be known as \"Koch's Postulates\" and were eventually refined by Koch: the pathogen accounts for the clinical and pathological features of the disease and must be found in every case in which the disease occurs; the pathogen is not found in other diseases as a nonpathogen; after being isolated from the body and repeatedly passed in pure culture, the pathogen can induce the disease in animal models; and the same pathogen must be re-isolated from the experimental animal (Brock 1988) . These criteria remained the gold standard upon which to judge evidence of microbial disease causation and are still valid to some extent today.",

Contemporary physicians who rejected the germ theory in favor of other theories of disease causation included Max von Pettenkoffer, the influential Munich hygienist and the celebrated cellular pathologist Rudolf Virchow. Pettenkoffer espoused the \"sanitation theory\" of disease, widely supported by social liberals, that poor sanitation, unfavorable water, soil conditions, and damp weather generated miasma poisons that subsequently caused illness, primarily in socio-economically disadvantaged populations. The cure for epidemics was therefore social progress and the elimination of poverty. Virchow, considered to be the founding father of cellular pathology and the most respected academic physician in Germany during Koch's era, remained an ardent opponent of the germ theory of infectious diseases; he never completely embraced Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence (Brock 1988; Kaufman and Winau 2005) . However, the germ theory of disease was embraced by the conservative Prussian government in Berlin largely because the fundamental premise was that communicable diseases were the consequences of exogenous microorganisms invading the body, circumstances that were largely independent of socioeconomics. Pathogen control could then be viewed as possible with central governmental controls, without having to address all the ills of society. The Prussian Parliament supported Koch's work with lavish funding for the Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases, which opened in Berlin in 1891 (Brock 1988) . The government's interests were more than altruistic; these were fervently nationalistic times. When Koch's team succeeded in isolating the Vibrio etiology of cholera in Egypt after Pasteur's group had failed, the German government hailed it as proof of the superiority of German science over French science, and Koch was welcomed back to Berlin with a hero's procession (Brock 1988; Kaufmann and Winau 2005) .",

Contemporaneously, agricultural scientists in the Netherlands and Russia discovered the \"filterable agent\" responsible for tobacco mosaic disease (Mayer 1886; Ivanowski 1892; Beijerinck 1898) . These infectious particles were capable of passing through submicron filters that were known to capture bacteria; hence, a new discipline within microbiology was founded based on sub-microscopic entities that did not completely conform to Koch's well-accepted scientific dogma.

This observation led to the elucidation of the structure of DNA in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins (Watson 1968) , which in turn led to the deciphering of the genetic code by the former two scientists and ushered in the modern era of molecular biology. The first complete genomic sequencing, that of a bacteriophage was accomplished in 1977 (Sanger et al. 1982) ; that of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, was accomplished nearly two decades later (Fleischmann et al. 1995) , followed shortly thereafter by the first draft of the human genome in 2001 (Altshuler 1995; Venter et al. 2001) . Recent advances in microbiology, including the development of recombinant DNA technology, the polymerase chain reaction, and monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized clinical microbiology and permitted the use of nonculture methods to diagnose fastidious or non-cultivatable organisms such as hepatitis C, Trophyrema whippelii, and a variety of other organisms that likely contribute to human disease (Fredricks and Relman 1996) .",

Metchnikoff (Fig. 3.9) , a comparative zoologist from the village of Kharkov in modern-day Ukraine, reasoned that this highly advantageous host defense he observed in starfish mesenchymal cells would be found in higher species as well (Silverstein 2003) . Aware of the potential significance of his findings, he changed his career path to human pathology and microbiology. With colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, Metchnikoff confirmed that phagocytosis by neutrophils (\"microcytes\") and macrophages was an essential part of the innate immune response in humans. He promulgated the idea of cell-mediated immunity as a defense against specific sets of microbial pathogens in 1884.",

While Karl Landsteiner's work in the early twentieth century questioned the plausibility that the human body could respond to the array of potential antigens found in the environment in this manner (Figl and Pelinka 2004) , Australian virologist-turned-immunologist F. Macfarlane Burnet proposed an alternative hypothesis in 1956 based on modifications of the theories of Danish immunologist Niels Jerne. Burnet's clonal selection theory, describing the activation, clonal proliferation, and subsequent targeted antibody secretion of lymphocytes after binding to a matched antigen, reconciled experimental observations and was subsequently shown to be the correct explanation for the generation of antibody diversity (Burnet 1957) .",

Over the last 100 years, the mortality burden of infectious diseases has decreased substantially and the average lifespan has increased by over 30 years due to advances in public health, sanitation, vaccines, and anti-infective chemotherapy -all deriving from the sciences of microbiology and immunology (Centers for Disease Control 1999). Future advances are anticipated when the genomics era in which we now live and the promise of systems biology and personalized medicine are fully realized in the next few decades. A remarkable story of directed inquiry into the fundamental nature of microbes and immune defenses preceded many of the current advances in medicine. Much work remains before the benefits of these discoveries can be applied equally worldwide.",
