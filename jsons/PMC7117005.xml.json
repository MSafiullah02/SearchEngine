            "text": "In commercial airliners, a strong association has been observed between cabin airflow patterns and the transmission of airborne infectious diseases [1]. These diseases include influenza [2], tuberculosis [3], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4]. With the rapid increase in air travel [5], improving cabin air quality has become crucial to public health. In commercial airplanes, personalized ventilation is typically provided by a system of gaspers, the small, circular, and adjustable vents above the seats passengers. When passengers turn on the gaspers, the air distribution in the cabin is altered [6], [7]. Consequently, the transport of airborne infectious contaminants is affected [8]. It is important to investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in commercial airliners in order to evaluate the effectiveness of gasper-induced ventilation in reducing the risk of infection.",

They found that the flow field was complex near the nozzle but could be simplified as a round jet when the flow was fully developed. You et al. [6] measured the airflow field in a full-scale, half-row, single-aisle aircraft cabin mockup with one gasper turned on, using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The measured data showed that the gasper-induced flow, the main flow in the cabin, and the thermal plume from a passenger interacted with each other and formed a complex flow field. Li et al. [8] measured the distributions of air velocity, temperature, and contaminant concentrations in the economy cabin of a functional MD-82 airplane with gaspers on and off. Although the gaspers directed clean air toward the passengers, the cabin air quality in this case was not improved.",

[6] evaluated the performance of the renormalization group (RNG) k-\u03b5 model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-\u03c9 model using their measured data. The SST k-\u03c9 model was found to be more accurate than the RNG k-\u03b5 model for predicting the air distribution of a gasper-induced jet. Shi et al. [10] calculated the entrainment ratio at different locations along a gasper-induced jet using a CFD model. They found that over 90% of the air in the breathing zone of a passenger was entrained from the surroundings when the gasper was turned on. Note that both of these studies used a detailed geometry with a large grid number to represent the actual gasper in the CFD simulations, which led to an unacceptably high computing cost. To overcome this problem, You et al. [7] developed a simplified gasper model to reduce the grid number for the gaspers without compromising the accuracy of the results.",

Namely, there is not a clear answer to the following question: will turning on the gaspers improve the cabin air quality in commercial airliners? To answer this question, this study first developed a hybrid turbulence model which was more suitable than previous models for predicting the air distribution in an aircraft cabin with gaspers turned on. The developed model was then validated using two sets of experimental data measured in a cabin mockup and an actual airplane. In addition, this investigation used the validated model to calculate the risk of infection by SARS in the seven-row section of economy-class cabin of two popular airplanes, Boeing 767 and 737, with different gasper on/off distributions. The database consisted of 9660 infection-risk data points, which were then used to explore the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in the two airplanes.",

When the cell is far away from the wall, F1 is equal to 0 and the hybrid turbulence model is equivalent to the RNG k-\u03b5 model. The blending function ensures that the hybrid model gradually changes from the standard k-\u03c9 model in the near wall regions to the RNG k-\u03b5 model in the bulk air regions. The detailed formulation of the blending function can be found in Menter [17]. The present study implemented a user-defined function code in ANSYS Fluent [18] to realize the proposed hybrid turbulence model.",

Calculating all the possible scenarios was unrealistic. Therefore, the quasi-random sampling method [21] was adopted to determine representative gasper on/off distributions. To illustrate the method, this paper uses the Boeing 767 cases as an example. First, this study considered five different gasper on/off ratios, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. These ratios indicate that, of the total of 49 gaspers, the corresponding number of gaspers that are turned on is 0, 12, 24, 37, or 49, respectively. For each gasper on/off ratio, there are still billions of possible distributions. For instance, when the gasper on/off ratio is 25%, 12 out of 49 gaspers are turned on. Therefore, there are C4912=9.2\u00d71010 possible scenarios. To reduce the number of cases, this investigation performed a quasi-random sampling. First, the gaspers corresponding to the seats from a1 to g7 were numbered from 1 to 49. Next, twelve numbers were quasi-randomly selected from the 49 using a Matlab code. Each quasi-random process corresponded to a specific gasper on/off distribution. Note that in this case, when the number of runs of the quasi-random process is sufficiently large, the chance of turning on the gasper for each passenger converges to 25%. In other words, the generated cases are representative of all the gasper on/off distributions when the gasper on/off ratio is 25%. To obtain the representative cases with a reasonable tolerance of error, one should determine how many runs of the quasi-random process are needed.",

Finally, the risk of acquiring SARS for each passenger was calculated using the Wells-Riley equation. The quanta of SARS was set at 2670 per hour [22], and the breathing flow rate of each passenger was set at 0.00053 m3/s, according to the ISO standard [23]. The flight durations for the Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 were set at 5 and 2 h, respectively, according to the actual durations of 1000 flights of the major airliners in the U.S. Since there were four contaminant source locations in the Boeing 767 and three locations in the Boeing 737, the total number of CFD cases was 420. Furthermore, there were 49 passengers in the cabin of the Boeing 767 and 42 in the Boeing 737; thus, this study generated a database containing 9660 data points for the risk of acquiring SARS.",

In other words, for a given source location, the database contains many data points for each passenger, corresponding to different gasper on/off distributions. Using the database, this study calculated the mean, maximum, minimum, 75th percentile, and 25th percentile of the infection risks for each passenger with various source locations. Fig. 7\n(a) and (b) show the data for each passenger when the source was located at seats 4d and 4g, respectively, in the Boeing 767. The points, the upper and lower bounds of the error bars, and the upper and lower bounds of the boxes represent the mean, the maximum and minimum, and the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively, of the infection risks for each passenger. Note that these variations were caused by the different gasper on/off distributions. The results show that the gasper on/off distribution can significantly affect the infection risk for each passenger. For example, when the source was at 4g, the SARS infection risk for the passenger seated at 3c ranged from 0.08 to 0.92 under different distributions. This variation occurred because the gasper-induced flows altered the air distribution in the cabin, which in turn influenced contaminant transport from the source and the receptors. To keep the paper concise, only the results with the source at seats 4d and 4g are shown in the figure. The results with the source at seats 4e and 4f point to the same conclusion.",

Statistically speaking, however, it is still unknown whether turning on a passenger's gasper will have a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. To answer this question, this study calculated the mean infection risk from the database for each passenger when he/she turned on his/her gasper. The mean infection risk for each passenger when he/she did not turn on the gasper was also calculated. Note that Fig. 9, Fig. 10\nincluded all cases in the database. Fig. 9 compares the mean SARS infection risk for the 49 passengers in the Boeing 767 when they turned their gaspers on and off. The horizontal axis indicates the mean infection risk when the gasper was off, while the vertical axis indicates the risk when the gasper was on. The solid line represents the 1:1 line, while the dashed line is the linear regression. Each point represents a passenger. If a point is located exactly on the 1:1 line, it means that there was no difference in the mean infection risk for that passenger when his/her gasper was turned on and off. If a point is above the 1:1 line, it means that turning on the gasper increased the mean infection risk for this passenger. If a point is below the 1:1 line, the risk was reduced by turning the gasper on. It can be seen in the figures that most of the points are close to the 1:1 line, and the slopes of the linear regressions are close to 1 with high R2 values. These results indicate that, statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on a passenger's gasper on the mean infection risk for the passenger was neutral for the general population.",

First, the gasper on/off distribution can significantly influence the infection risk for each passenger. Furthermore, statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on a passenger's gasper on the mean infection risk for the passenger is neutral. That is to say, turning on a passenger's gasper could result in either a positive or negative impact on his/her infection risk. The practical implication is that, even though a gasper supplies clean air that is aimed at a passenger, it may actually have a negative effect on the passenger's health. If the specific gasper on/off distribution produces a high contaminant concentration in the region above a passenger's head, turning on the gasper may bring more contaminants into the breathing zone of the passenger as a result of the strong air entrainment [10]. Therefore, when a passenger is deciding whether or not to turn on his/her gasper, the conventional understanding that the clean air supplied from the gasper enhances the air quality is not necessarily correct. If the passenger's health is fragile, he/she should consider not turning on the gasper to avoid the possibility of increased infection risk.",
