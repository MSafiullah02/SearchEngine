Given its initial success, transfusion support was considered to be an indispensable tool in the development of many modern therapies such as high dose chemotherapy, transplantation and complex surgeries. Focus was on ensuring the safety and quality of the products used, with much less attention directed to addressing the clinical use of the product. Much of the use of blood associated with such treatments has not been based upon science, but on tradition and anecdotal experience. A variety of factors are, however, now changing our previous paradigm, as we begin to question the clinical benefits of blood transfusion.",

At the same time, the population aged 64 years or less, which includes the age range eligible to donate blood, will only increase by 38% [2]. This is an important observation because studies show that significantly more blood is used for patients in the older age groups [3].

An earlier study by Cantor et al. came to similar conclusions [7]. Process cost analysis shows how many steps are involved in \u2018delivering\u2019 a blood transfusion to a patient and each of these is a cost to the health system [8]. A recent study, shortly to be published, mapped the encounters involved in providing and administering red cell transfusions to patients in two teaching hospitals in Australia. Costs of potential adverse outcomes were not included. From this analysis, the cost of transfusion of a single unit of red cells, including acquisition costs, was AUS$700 [A Hofmann; E Wood; unpublished data]. Another multi\u2010centre study analyzed process cost in the surgical setting and showed even higher cost per RBC unit transfused [9]. All transfusion related costs, including short term adverse effects and suspected mid\u2010 and long\u2010term adverse effects, might equal up to 5% of the total public healthcare budget of some HDI countries. In our increasingly strained health economies, minimizing unnecessary transfusion will result in significant health savings.",

This also correlates with the level at which patients experience an increased mortality [46, 47]. Moreover, factors other than haemoglobin levels are also likely to affect this critical threshold, and relying on a single blood parameter may not be accurate enough to distinguish individual patients\u2019 oxygenation status [48].
