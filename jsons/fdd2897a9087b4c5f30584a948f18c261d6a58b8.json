In addition, based on conversations with our program officer, it was also determined that videoconferencing the intervention would change the nature of the intervention itself. Although the clinical trial was temporarily suspended, we continued to contact our participants weekly via phone calls as per study protocol; however, we also used it as a 'check-in' and added a few questions, with IRB approval, regarding the coronavirus situation to track any possible adverse events. As part of the weekly calls during the COVID-19 social distancing period, participants are currently being asked a subset of 7 questions related to their potential symptoms of COVID-19, experiences in SARS-CoV-2 testing, the effects on their HIV care, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among the sample, 3 participants experienced one potential symptom of COVID-19 which were a productive cough (n = 2) and a dry cough (n = 1). However, the participants who listed productive cough as a symptom said that the cough preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. Four participants sought SARS-CoV-2 testing, but interestingly none of the participants who reported symptoms were those who sought testing. Three of those who sought testing received a test. Two tested negative and 1 participant was awaiting results. The participant who was unable to receive testing indicated that it was due to being unaware that an appointment was necessary to receive a test. These findings could highlight potential barriers in educating older PLWH in COVID-19 symptoms and testing; particularly as it pertains to (1) identifying symptoms of COVID-19, (2) knowing who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, (3) the appropriate protocol to procure a test depending on location (i.e. drive through testing vs appointment driven testing).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 Related Information Collected"}, {"text": "When looking at the effects of COVID-19 on HIV care, we found among participants who had HIV care appointments since the initiation of social distancing (n = 12), ten participants were able to keep their HIV health care appointments.

Among the most stressful things participants reported were potential exposures to SARS-CoV-2, adjusting to social distancing, and issues related to finances.

One participant did report not being able to get a SARS-CoV-2 test because they did not have an appointment. It is unclear why this was the case. Clinics should prioritize certain vulnerable populations such as older PLWH for testing, or perhaps provide testing during a routine care visit if available. Stress levels do seem to be impacted by COVID-19, and for our participants, stress revolved around its impact on their health, on their sense of social isolation, and their economic situation. For example, one participant asked if they could receive the study incentive even if the trial was suspended. Researchers should consider how suspension of studies may financially affect their target population. We did not ask about social isolation directly; however, anecdotally, our research interviewer has observed how happy our participants are to receive his phone calls and to talk to someone. One participant was so grateful, he states, she cried during the phone call. Social isolation and mental health should be assessed and addressed during such a crisis event.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Insights and Implications"}, {"text": "Several policy implications should be considered.

In sum, weekly phone calls can help researchers maintain contact with participants and provides an option for further data collection.
