The pathogen was soon identified and sequenced as a novel coronavirus related to the agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was subsequently termed SARS Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The infection spread in the subsequent 3 months on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As of April 2, 2020, 961,818 documented cases were reported worldwide, and 49,165 patients had died (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). This novel coronavirus has a tropism for the lung, causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Some patients with pneumonia suddenly deteriorate into severe respiratory failure (SRF) and require intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV). The risk of death of these patients is high, reaching even 60% (Arabi et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Proper management mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis. The majority of physicians use sepsis as a prototype of critical illness for the understanding of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. This is mostly because severe COVID-19 is associated with hyper-cytokinemia (Guan et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020). Lethal sepsis is commonly arising from bacterial CAP, often leading to SRF and the need for MV. The peculiar clinical course of CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2, including the sudden deterioration of the clinical condition 7\u20138 days after the first symptoms, generates the hypothesis that this illness is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction that is likely different from sepsis. The features of lymphopenia with hepatic dysfunction and increase of D-dimers (Qin et al., 2020) in these patients with severe disease further support this hypothesis.",

We investigated whether this classification might apply to patients with SRF caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed that approximately one fourth of patients with SRF have MAS and that most patients suffer from immune dysregulation dominated by low expression of HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes, which is triggered by monocyte hyperactivation, excessive release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and profound lymphopenia. This pattern is distinct from the immunoparalysis state reported in either bacterial sepsis or SRF caused by 2009 H1N1 influenza.",

Patients with bacterial CAP were screened for participation in a large-scale randomized clinical trial with the acronym PROVIDE (ClinicalTrials.gov\nNCT03332225). Patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza have been described in previous publications of our group (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2009, Raftogiannis et al., 2010). The clinical characteristics of patients with bacterial CAP and CAP caused by COVID-19 are described in Table 1\n. Each cohort (bacterial sepsis and COVID-19) is split into patients who developed SRF and required MV and those who did not. Three main features need to be outlined: (1) patients with COVID-19 and SRF are less severe than those with severe bacterial CAP, on the basis of the traditional severity scores of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II; (2) this leads to the conclusion that COVID-19 patients undergo an acute immune dysregulation with deterioration into SRF before the overall state of severity is advanced; and (3) although the burden of co-morbidities of patients with COVID-19, as expressed by the Charlson\u2019s co-morbidity index, is higher among patients with SRF than among patients without SRF, it remains remarkably lower that traditional bacterial CAP and sepsis. It was also notable that the admission values of Glasgow Coma Scale scores of patients with bacterial CAP were 8.80 \u00b1 4.76, and that of patients with COVID-19 was 14.71 \u00b1 0.20 (p < 0.0001). This finding is fully compatible with clinical descriptions of severe COVID-19: patients are admitted at a relatively good clinical state and suddenly deteriorate.",

This also happens in immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 1A and 1B). Although patients with bacterial-CAP-associated MAS also have decreased HLA-DR molecules on CD14 monocytes, their circulating ferritin is significantly higher than normal. This is a feature found only in a few patients with SARS-CoV-2 and MAS (Figure 1C). The absence of traits of MAS among cases of SARS-CoV-2 with immune dysregulation is further proven by the low scores of hemophagocytosis (HS). HScore is proposed as a classification tool for secondary MAS, and values more than 169 are highly diagnostic (Fardet et al., 2014). Seven patients with SARS-CoV-2 had HS above this cut-off, and all were properly classified by using ferritin (Figure 1D). Among patients with bacterial CAP at an intermediate immune state, the number of molecules of HLA-DR on their CD14 monocytes was lower than in healthy patients. However, patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 at an intermediate immune state maintained their number of molecules of HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes much closer to the healthy condition. When this number suddenly dropped, SRF supervened (Figures 1A and 1B). Moreover, the absolute counts of neutrophils and monocytes were higher among patients with immune dysregulation than patients with MAS (Figures 1E and 1F).",

Indeed, production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) by LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with bacterial CAP classified for immunoparalysis was significantly lower than in patients at an intermediate state (Figure 4\nA). That was not the case for patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, in whom PBMCs showed sustained TNF-\u03b1 production after stimulation with LPS (Figure 4B). The function of PBMCs in patients with SRF caused by 2009H1N1 was also impaired, and there was lower TNF-\u03b1 production, a pattern different from COVID-19 patients (Figure 4C). Surprisingly, stimulation of IL-1\u03b2 was lower among patients with immune dysregulation than among patients with an intermediate immune state (Figures 4D\u20134F). IL-6, however, followed the stimulation pattern of TNF-\u03b1 (Figures 4G\u20134I). This generated the hypothesis that in the case of SRF-aggravated pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is a unique combination of defective antigen presentation and lymphopenia that leads to defective function of lymphoid cells, whereas monocytes remain potent for the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.",

These findings support the rationale of launched clinical trials on the efficacy of Anakinra, Sarilumab, Siltuximab, and Tocilizumab (Clinicaltrials.gov\nNCT04330638, NCT04317092, and NCT04315298 and EudraCT number 2020-001039-29) to elaborate anti-inflammatory responses in these patients.",

COVID was diagnosed for patients with CAP confirmed by chest X-ray or chest computed tomography and positive molecular testing of respiratory secretions. For patients who required MV, blood sampling was performed within the first 24 h from MV and results were used for this analysis. Exclusion criteria were infection by the human immunodeficiency virus; neutropenia; and any previous intake of immunosuppressive medication (corticosteroids, anti-cytokine biologicals, and biological response modifiers). SRF was defined as severe decrease of the respiratory ratio necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation.
