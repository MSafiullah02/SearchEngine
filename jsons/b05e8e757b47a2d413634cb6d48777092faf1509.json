In the particular case of epidemics, every hour counts and there is an urge in predicting the temporal evolution of the disease aiming to find the best way to deal with it and to establish a proper control of its spread. Recently, the pandemic Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease) has been rapidly spreading all over the world, being needless to mention the impact of it in our lives in a broad context, see, e.g., Refs. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . It has been proposed that such a quick spread of Covid-19 in human beings is associated with a spike protein, which in turn has a site that is triggered by an enzyme called furin. The latter lies dangling on the surface of the virus, leading thus to the infection of human cells unfortunately much more easily 20 . Therefore, there is an urgency of an appropriate mathematical description of the spread of Covid-19. This is particularly true aiming to support the health government agencies all over the world to maximize the effectiveness of medical support strategy in such a global crisis. To this end, here we make use of the celebrated Ising-model 1 and of a Fermi-Dirac-like function 21 . We demonstrate the close relation between the number of people following the proposed quarantine and the spread of Covid-19. Although it is quite obvious that the more people respect the quarantine the lower will be the number of infected people, a proper quantitative description is still lacking.",

In order to determine a proper mathematical expression for \u03b4\u03b5, one must take into account the number of isolated people n in quarantine. Here, we propose that the contact between infected and non-infected people can be described considering \u03b4\u03b5 \u221d n \u22121/2 , with 1 < n < N . As a matter of fact, we have tried different power-laws for \u03b4\u03b5 in terms of n, but it turns out that \u03b4\u03b5 \u221d n \u22121/2 provides an appropriate fit for the data set. This is a reasonable assumption, since as n \u2192 0, \u03b4\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e, i.e., the lower the number of isolated people in quarantine the higher will be the contact between them and, consequently, the number of infected people will be enhanced. Note that Eq. 1 does not incorporate any time evolution. It turns out that upon analyzing already officially reported epidemic curves 24, 25 , their typical time evolution in terms of the new cases per day follows an initial rapid increase of the number of infected people, which is usually assumed to be exponential, achieving a maximum value, which is followed by a drop.",

            "text": "Aiming to demonstrate the validity of our analysis, we start recalling the data set for Ebola, SARS, and Influenza A/H1N1. Their epidemic curves, depicted in Fig. 1 , can be described by a fitting employing a Gaussian function. Table 1 shows the parameters obtained in the fitting for the various epidemics ( Fig. 1) and their respective standard deviations. At this point, it is worth emphasizing that the Gaussian fitting for the epidemic curves must be performed carefully, since the low density [see, e.g., Fig. 1 b) ] of available data can give rise to a non-intrinsic behavior. In other words, it is clear that it is not possible to make a forecast of an epidemic curve by only employing the data set associated with the initial growth of the epidemic curve. Now, we focus on the analysis of 6 the spread of Covid-19. We start with the available data set for Covid-19 in South Korea, see Fig. 2 a) . The number of people joining the quarantine is directly associated with the previously defined interaction (contact) \u03b4\u03b5 between infected and non-infected people. As discussed, in a hypothetical situation where no one joins the quarantine n \u2192 0 and so \u03b4\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e, which means that everyone interacts freely with each other. This would be the worst case at all. It has been broadly discussed that upon increasing the number of infected people in quarantine, the maximum in the epidemic curve associated with the number of new cases is not only lowered, but it is also shifted, indicating that the spread of Covid-19 will be more contained. The latter corresponds to the desired situation in terms of controlling the spread, since the health government agencies will have more time to manage the situation. Note that our analysis based on the Ising-like model incorporates such feature, already discussed in the media, see, e.g., Ref. 31 . We demonstrate such a situation employing the data set available for South Korea, assuming an hypothetical finite \u03b4\u03b5 incorporated in the Gaussian function employed in the analysis, cf. depicted in the inset of Fig. 2 a). More specifically, when \u03b4\u03b5 is lowered the maximum number of infected people is decreased and its position in time is increased, making thus the disease spread more controllable. Such decrease in \u03b4\u03b5 represents more people joining the quarantine and avoiding contact with each other. Now, we treat the available data set of the spread of Covid-19 in China in terms of the FD-like distribution function. As depicted in Fig. 2 b) , the number of accumulated infected people versus elapsed time saturated after roughly 60 days since the outbreak of Covid-19. In other words, for large values of t the ratio I(t)/P \u2192 1. Equation 5 fits nicely such data set, cf. Fig. 2 b) . In the following, we 8 discuss the similarity between Eq. 5 and the FD distribution function. Rearranging Eq. 5, we have:",

Indeed, the time evolution of the Covid-19 spread has a similar significance than T for the FD distribution function for the Fermi gas. The behavior of I(t)/P as a function of C/C * is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 b) for several values of t. Considering that in our fit using Eq. 5 for the spread of Covid-19 in China [inset of Fig. 2 b) ] we have obtained m = 2716, it becomes clear that we are dealing with a distorted variation of the FD function where m = 1, cf. Fig. 2 c) . Hence, at some extent, we are faced with a behavior analogous to the distorted FD distribution for electrons in the picture of Landau Fermi-liquid 32, 33 . Also, we emphasize that the ratio I(t)/P gives us the probability of a person being infected in a certain time t in a similar way that f (E, T ) dictates the probability of a state with energy E being occupied at a certain temperature T . We anticipate that the spread of Covid-19 for other countries, not discussed in the present work given the lack of available data, should follow the same behavior as here discussed for South Korea and China. The position of the maximum in the epidemic curve, described by a Gaussian function, as well as I(t), will be a reflex of the policies taken by the health government agencies by a particular country. Last but not least, this work was written during our period of quarantine.",
