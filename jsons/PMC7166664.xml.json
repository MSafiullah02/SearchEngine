            "text": "Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory tract infection, which is a distressing, potentially life\u2010threatening respiratory condition that affects young babies [Rosalind, 2006]. It is generally characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, leading to rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, hyperexpansion of the lungs, hypoxia, and respiratory distress [Panitch, 2003; Pavia, 2011]. RSV is the most common etiological agent of bronchiolitis. It was estimated that 66,000\u2013199,000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV\u2010associated acute respiratory tract infection in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries [Nair et al., 2010]. In the UK, the RSV\u2010attributed death rate in infants has been estimated to be 8.4 per 100,000 [Fleming et al., 2005]. The incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year. At present, there is no special medicine for the treatment of bronchiolitis. It has been reported that approximately 1% of infants with bronchiolitis need to go to the hospital for treatment and that 10% of them require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) [Nagakumar and Doull, 2012].",

            "text": "It has been reported that the RSV loads after symptom onset are correlated with disease severity in hospitalized infants [Buckingham et al., 2000; Scagnolari et al., 2012]. Higher RSV loads predict disease severity in infants who were previously healthy correlating with longer durations of hospitalization [DeVincenzo et al., 2005; El Saleeby et al., 2011]. Recent studies also report that disease severity is positively correlated with the viral load during primary RSV infection [Houben et al., 2010]. Some reports have investigated the relationship between RSV viral dynamics and disease severity. In their study, the viral loads on day 3 were associated more significantly with a requirement for intensive care and respiratory failure than the viral loads at earlier time points. Faster RSV clearance was independently associated with shorter hospitalization [El Saleeby et al., 2011]. Clinical improvement was associated with a reduction of viral quantity after three days of hospitalization [Jansen et al., 2010]. However, the relationship between changes in the RSV load dynamics and the disease severity of RSV\u2010infected infants has not been studied in detail. Understanding the relationship between the clinical severity of bronchiolitis and the dynamic RSV load will aid the risk factor assessment of clinical severity and help the development of timely intervention therapy. It will thus provide a conceptual background for understanding the disease pathogenesis of RSV and other respiratory virus infections.",

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is according to the Zhu Futang textbook of Pediatrics [Zhang, 2002]. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed from the presence of a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnea, retraction, wheezing, and diffuse crackles on auscultation. Patients were excluded if they had received antiviral (ribavirin) and immunomodulatory agents (prednisone or hydrocortisone) in the preceding two weeks. Children with wheezing, breathlessness, and obstruction of the airways, in whom similar episodes had previously been diagnosed and treated by a physician, were diagnosed as recurrent wheezing and were excluded. Qualified pediatricians identified bronchiolitis and its clinical severity and collected clinical information confidentially. The demographic data and clinical history were collected from guardians via interviews. This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Council of Chongqing Children's Hospital, and signed consent was obtained from each child's parents or foster parents.",

The sequence of the N gene for the RSV A2 strain (GenBank accession number M11486) and that for the RSV B strain (GenBank accession number D00736) were used for the design of the primers and probes. The plasmid\u2010amplified target fragment was cloned into the pMD19\u2010T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and verified by sequencing. The plasmid DNA concentrations were detected with an ND\u20101000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). Real\u2010time qPCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 20 \u00b5l consisting of 10 \u00b5l of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.6 \u00b5l (10 mM) of each primer, 0.6 \u00b5l (10 mM) of the probe, 2 \u00b5l of template and 6.2 \u00b5l of double\u2010distilled water. The real\u2010time qPCR thermal cycling reaction and quantitative measurement were performed in a 96\u2010well format in a StepOne Real\u2010Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: one cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, and one cycle at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Strict laboratory procedures were followed to prevent PCR contamination, including separate spaces for sample handling, the Master Mix ingredients, and the plasmid templates. All of the runs included negative controls and plasmid in each PCR assay. Representative results from the real\u2010time qPCR quantification were found for the serial dilutions of RSVA and RSVB plasmids (101\u2013107 copies/reaction) with the baseline\u2010corrected fluorescence plotted against the cycle number. The standard curves were positioned within each plate, and each run was performed in duplicate. For standard curves of five independent runs, the mean correlation coefficient of RSVA was 0.996 with a standard deviation of 0.004, and the mean value of the slope was \u22123.53 with a standard deviation of 0.04. The mean correlation coefficient of RSVB was 0.998 with a standard deviation of 0.02, and the mean value of the slope was \u22123.56 with a standard deviation of 0.17.

Other research has reported that age contributed to disease severity to a larger extent [Brand et al., 2012]. However, the age was not the independent risk factor of the degree of severity in this study. The age of patients with severe disease was significantly lower than that with moderate and mild disease in Table IV. The median age of the infants in severe group was 2 months whereas that was 4.5 months in moderate group and 5 months in mild group. It is known to us that babies lost maternal antibody protection at 4\u20136 months, and their own immune system is not mature enough to protect them against virus. Some reports have determined age\u2010specific incidence estimates for hospitalization with severe RSV disease and compared neutralizing antibody response patterns. Disease incidence peaked at between 2 and 3.9 months of life. Following RSV natural infection, relative to the mean acute phase antibody titre, the mean convalescent titre was lower in the 0\u20131.9 month age class, no different in the 2\u20133.9 month age class and greater in all age classes greater than 4 months [Sande et al., 2014].",

The infants in the severe group tended to have a higher mean RSV load than the moderate and mild groups. These observations were consistent with other report [El Saleeby et al., 2011]. It has been described the relationship between the viral dynamics and the RSV disease severity on each study day (days 1, 2, and 3). Faster RSV clearance was independently associated with shorter hospitalization. However, this study observed that the RSV load on day 3 was independently associated with the degree of severity, and this finding was not determined for the rest of the study time points. Their study did not test the association between viral load and disease severity after day 3. This different result may be associated with the date of disease onset. In this study, previously healthy children aged \u226424 months were enrolled if they had been diagnosed with bronchiolitis within 96 hr of wheezing onset. In their study, patients were enrolled if RSV was detected from their respiratory secretions within the past 48 hr.",

The predominant RSV subtype shifts from year to year [Zhang et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2014], and the immunity against the previous circulating subtype could have altered the disease severity caused by specific subtypes. Infection with RSVA has been shown in several studies to produce more severe disease than RSVB [Papadopoulos et al., 2004; Tran et al., 2013]. In this study, there were nine infants with RSVA, and no significant differences were observed in the viral load and clinical severity between the infants with RSVA and those with RSVB. Few studies have demonstrated no significant differences in clinical severity between RSV subtypes [Devincenzo, 2004; Fodha et al., 2007; Jafri et al., 2013].
