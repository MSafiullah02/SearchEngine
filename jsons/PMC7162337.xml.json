However NGR\u2010modified endostatin showed complete inhibition of bFGF\u2010induced endothelial cell migration at 5 nM. At the higher concentrations, NGR\u2010endostatin showed > 100% inhibition, indicating that even basal migration (in the absence of bFGF) was inhibited by NGR\u2010endostatin. In a parallel study, NGR\u2010containing synthetic peptide (SR\u20101) was admixed with native endostatin to determine whether the presence of NGR\u2010peptide in the medium was sufficient to change the biologic activity of native endostatin. The data illustrated in Figure 2D show that admixing 50 nM endostatin along with the NGR synthetic peptide did not alter the basal level of endostatin\u2010mediated inhibition of cell migration. The results from these studies suggest that an NGR moiety should be an integral part of endostatin to potentiate the biologic activity of endostatin.",

In some model systems, endostatin treatment either inhibited or regressed experimental tumors.12 Other studies showed only moderate inhibition.25 Bacterial expression systems often have resulted in insoluble proteins, necessitating a refolding protocol. It has been suggested that the slow release of endostatin from the insoluble suspension, coupled with proper refolding in vivo, is responsible for the potent inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Kranenburg et al. reported that a denatured, insoluble form of endostatin showed better bioactivity than a soluble form of endostatin.26 Kruger et al. demonstrated the different efficacy between Calbiochem\u2010endostatin and EntreMed\u2010endostatin.27 Genetic expression of human endostatin in bacteria and yeast seems to affect its biologic activity. Differences in potency and solubility characteristics, which reflect in part on protein folding, may explain the differences seen in endostatin efficacy in vivo. Understanding the basis for these discrepancies will aid in the successful clinical development of endostatin.",

In the current study, we evaluated whether an NGR motif also could potentiate the activity of endostatin by virtue of binding to APN expressed on endothelial cells. We showed that an NGR motif increased endothelial cell attachment that was specific to APN expression. NGR\u2010endostatin did not alter the basal binding of APN\u2010negative WM35 melanoma cells. The data presented in the current study further validate the finding that the internal NGR sequence present in the native endostatin is not accessible to bind APN or to inhibit its enzymatic activity. The addition of an NGR motif to endostatin showed significant inhibition of APN activity in endothelial cell lysates. Furthermore, an NGR sequence at the amino terminus of endostatin enhanced the efficacy of endostatin to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Curnis et al. showed that similar modification of TNF did not alter its affinity or biologic activity in vitro.6 However, an NGR motif improved the efficacy of TNF in vivo. In the current study, we observed that the addition of an NGR sequence to endostatin increased its binding to endothelial cells and enhanced its biologic activity. No improvement in the biologic activity was seen when native endostatin was admixed with NGR peptides. These results suggest that enhanced inhibition of endothelial cells is dependent on an NGR motif in association with endostatin. In previous studies, doxorubicin conjugated with NGR peptides showed less toxicity to tumor cells in vitro (72 hours) compared with unconjugated doxorubicin.7 However, NGR\u2010conjugated doxorubicin showed better efficacy in vitro with a short exposure (20 minutes)28 and inhibited tumor growth in vivo better compared with unconjugated doxorubicin.7, 28 Ellerby et al. showed that the biologic activity of a proapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 was improved both in vitro and in vivo by an NGR motif.8 Recently, Bhagwat et al. showed that inhibition of the angiogenic signal transduction pathway can be restored by the overexpression of APN.29 Therefore, the blockage of APN activity by an NGR motif and the antiangiogenic effect of endostatin could act synergistically.",

Increased accumulation of NGR\u2010endostatin was correlated with greater antiangiogenic effects in vivo. Morphometric analysis revealed that NGR\u2010endostatin treatment reduced vessel density in residual tumors. Decreased numbers of blood vessels coincided with increased apoptosis in tumor tissue.
