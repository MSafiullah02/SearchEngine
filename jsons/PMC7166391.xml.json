However, not all agreed with this suggestion.11 Moreover, the combination of HS and BA was more effective than normal saline \u00b1 BA in decreasing symptoms,12 but no difference was found in the clinical bronchiolitis severity score (CBSS).13 Researchers have proved that EP is more efficient and safer than salbutamol.14 Another study supported EP's efficacy but could not reach a conclusion on which agent was safer.15 It seems that EP is more reliable than salbutamol. Some scientists found that HS is better at reducing admission days than 0.9% normal saline.16 However, another article suggested that the application of EP, HS, salbutamol, and normal saline showed no significant discrepancy in their efficacy in treating infants with mild bronchiolitis.17 In summary, there is no consensus in current research; therefore, more trials and analysis are required.",

CS is a type of steroid hormone that is extracted from vertebrates\u2019 adrenal cortex or some synthetic analogues of hormones. CS is usually applied to physiologic processes such as protein catabolism, immune response, and so on.56 It is a widely used intervention, and there are several kinds of HS concentrations, the most common being 3%. Three percent HS plays an important role in treating severe hyponatremia, acutely increased intracranial pressure, and critical care settings.57 Inhalational HS is believed to have a curative effect on respiratory problems such as bronchiolitis.58 Based on our research, a combination of these medicines showed a better efficacy than therapy with the use of 1 treatment alone.",

A report that claimed that 3% HS \u00b1 EP could improve CSS in infants with mild to moderate viral bronchiolitis28 also supports our conclusions. Some research also took into consideration the concentration of HS as this may have a significant effect on efficacy. For example, it was demonstrated that 5% HS \u00b1 EP and 3% HS \u00b1 EP had a better performance in improving CSS than 0.9% normal saline. However, 5% HS \u00b1 EP had a stronger potential to reduce clinical severity than 3% HS \u00b1 EP.37 This reminded us of the importance of concentration and why we should pay more attention to it in clinical practice. EP \u00b1 CS also had a brilliant performance with respect to CSS and LHS. Through the investigation and study of infants with bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department, it was found that dexamethasone (a kind of CS) with EP may effectively reduce LHS.9 In addition, another study of infants with acute bronchiolitis implied that EP \u00b1 CS (dexamethasone) was significantly different from BA.10 This is consistent with our conclusions.",

Grewal et al40 conducted a randomized trial of severe bronchiolitis in the emergency department and concluded that 3% HS \u00b1 EP does not significantly reduce CSS compared with normal saline. Similarly, another experiment also could not find any difference in infants with mild bronchiolitis.17 The above studies did not accord with most published results, but we could not simply omit them. Furthermore, some controversy also exists in the effect of EP \u00b1 CS. An RCT showed that EP \u00b1 CS did not play a role in bronchiolitis management for first\u2010time wheezing infants due to a lack of positive effect on CSS and LHS.31 This result was not reflected in our SUCRA results, and the inconsistency may be caused by several reasons. First, this NMA synthesized experimental data of HS without the consideration of HS concentration. The curative effect may be sensitive to concentration. Second, there may be some inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Last but not least, this study built a random\u2010effects network based on a Bayesian framework using the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, but it did not have an unbiased estimator.59 This may consequently affect the SUCRA values.",
