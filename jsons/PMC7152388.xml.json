Pharyngitis is broadly defined as mucous membrane inflammation either localized to the posterior pharynx or contiguous with the adjacent membranes of the posterior nares or larynx. Differences in the extent of pharyngeal inflammation and in accompanying signs and symptoms help distinguish between GAS and viruses (Table 33-2\n). Patients with GAS most often demonstrate sudden onset of sore throat, marked pain with swallowing, and fever (Figure 33-1\n). Other signs and symptoms indicative of GAS include headache, nausea, vomiting, and the absence of cough and coryza. Findings that favor viral pathogens include conjunctivitis, punctate ulcerative tonsillar lesions, and stomatitis (Figure 33-2\n). Certain strains of GAS can trigger scarlet fever by elaborating an erythrogenic toxin that induces a bright, fine, maculopapular rash. Starting over the neck, the rash extends to the trunk and extremities and is particularly prominent over flexural creases and the perineum. After several days the rash fades and is followed by a fine desquamation as seen with sunburn. The lingual papillae become quite prominent, producing the characteristic \u201cstrawberry tongue\u201d appearance.",

Strains of A. haemolyticum even induce a scarlatiniform rash similar to scarlet fever. Viruses may also mimic the clinical findings of GAS pharyngitis. Adenoviral pharyngitis causes tonsillar exudate, adenopathy, and fever over half of the time, mostly in children. More readily distinguished from GAS is adenoviral pharyngoconjunctival fever, which usually manifests as a unilateral follicular conjunctivitis, though it progresses to the other eye one fourth of the time. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) manifests with acute onset of sore throat, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy, and in one half of cases the pharyngitis is exudative (Figure 33-3\n). Occasionally, palatal petechiae appear, making EBV even more difficult to distinguish from GAS pharyngitis. Splenomegaly (present in 50% of patients), generalized lymphadenopathy, and periorbital edema, when present, provide clinical evidence in favor of EBV. HSV pharyngitis may manifest with fever, exudative pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. In college students diagnosed with HSV pharyngitis, only one third demonstrated lesions typical of HSV.

Whereas patients infected with other bacterial pathogens, such as non\u2013group A streptococci, may benefit from antimicrobial therapy, they do not merit widespread screening or empirical antimicrobial treatment strategies. The problem is that GAS pharyngitis cannot be diagnosed by clinical evidence alone. Even experienced physicians are accurate only 50% of the time when examining patients with exudative pharyngitis. Despite this limitation, clinical judgment retains an important role in pharyngitis diagnosis and management. Clinical scoring tools, such as the modified Centor score, have proven useful in identifying patients at low risk for GAS (Table 33-3\n). Patients with clinical scores of 0 to 1 are at low risk for GAS and require no further testing and no antimicrobial treatment. More complicated is the approach to patients who are at less low risk for GAS, such as those with clinical scores \u22652. Patients with modified Centor scores of \u22652 are positive for GAS in only 15% to 50% of patients. Reliance on clinical scoring tools alone can result in up to 40% of patients receiving an unnecessary antimicrobial. In an effort to further aid clinicians in improving GAS diagnosis, several guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pharyngitis have been advanced. Inherent to these pharyngitis guidelines is a basic diagnostic and management strategy that still relies on clinical judgment in avoiding the errors of overtreatment and undertreatment.",

The finding of non\u2013group A streptococci in a patient with uncomplicated pharyngitis is rarely helpful, as it may represent normal flora. In GAS-negative patients with findings suggestive of A. haemolyticum, a routine throat culture may not be sufficient to identify the organism. In patients with persistent sore throats, cultures for F. necrophorum require an anaerobic throat culture. All specimens for virus isolation should stipulate the virus requested (e.g., HSV, enterovirus, or adenovirus) and should be transported in the appropriate viral medium at 4\u00b0 C. All concern regarding C. diphtheriae should be addressed to an infectious disease specialist and local health officials.",

Benefits of treatment include prevention of ARF, a decrease in suppurative complications, and a shortened course of illness. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for treatment of GAS pharyngitis because of its narrow spectrum of activity, proven record of efficacy, safety, and cost. Penicillin V is the preferred oral choice; however, for children requiring an oral suspension, amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative because of its palatability. Ampicillin offers no advantages over penicillin V. Although injectable penicillins offer single-dose convenience, their routine use is uncommon and affords no other advantage except in ensuring compliance. Oral penicillin and amoxicillin are effective with either twice-daily or three-times-daily administration, and the duration is 10 days. Shorter courses may be effective but are not recommended. Patients allergic to penicillin without a history of immediate or type I hypersensitivity to penicillin can be treated with a cephalosporin or macrolide. The use of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin should be limited to individuals allergic to penicillin because of increasing reports of macrolide resistance among strains of GAS in the United States and worldwide. Starting appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 9 days of disease onset is sufficient to prevent ARF.",

Among adults, however, there are no clinically significant differences between penicillin and cephalosporins (87% versus 92% eradication; 90% versus 95% clinical cure). The validity of these comparisons continues to be debated and both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) continue to recommend penicillin as first-line therapy, although cephalosporins may be considered as an alternative choice.",
