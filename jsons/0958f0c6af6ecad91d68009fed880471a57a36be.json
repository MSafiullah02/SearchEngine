            "text": "Given the current trends witnessed in parts of Europe and North America it is expected that Australia and the United States, as a well as many other countries will suffer escalating numbers of COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalisation in the near future putting tremendous pressure on our healthcare personnel and their services. Considering the existing limited global supply and competition for PPE and face masks, it is therefore expected that severe shortages of protective face masks will be encountered for some countries and communities. While we all hope that such situations will not develop, the time is now to prepare for a worst-case scenario in which the demand for face masks cannot be sustained. Such a situation, which the global community has never had to experience before, will require novel and alternative actions requiring close coordination between our medical and materials engineering, as well as our manufacturing experts and industry. Solutions must be found within temporary and short-term measures of refreshing face masks for extended wear, reusing them after a cleaning process or similar strategies. Now is the time to consider additional risk management solutions to best deal with likely scenarios that we hope to avoid. This is call for action of the global engineering and research communities to immediately consider additional avenues for recyclability, extended use, and the underlying material science for reliable function of PPE and face masks, with many experts particularly well represented in the Polymer Degradation and Stability field. Preliminary work as pointers for what can be accomplished exists and a global response has already been triggered. References on disinfection of face masks containing a polymer-fibre filter suggest that under suitable conditions a filtration efficiency of >94.74 1 can be achieved after thermal disinfection treatment without sustaining damage to the filter unit. 2 Disinfection and extended use, though, is not without risk and there are suggestions that some parts of a mask may suffer physical damage during repeated disinfection cycles. 2 By careful monitoring of the material properties before and after disinfection we believe this risk can be managed and viable options for reuse exist. Recycling and disinfection methods may include simple thermal treatments, exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapours, UV or gamma-irradiation sterilisation, ethylene oxide gas, detergent-based cleaning methods or the application of spray-on disinfectants. Indeed, recent news stories have shown some hospitals already using hydrogen peroxide 3 or UV-irradiation 4 on used filtering facepiece respirator type face masks demonstrating ingenuity out of necessity, but also highlighting a need for materials scientists to support these activities as well as develop improved disinfection methods that are robust and amenable to a number of different settings where resources may be highly varied. We need a focus on large scale recyclability approaches, as well as simple and easy to conduct methods within the context of 'anything is better than nothing' that could work on the local level and also be carried out by the public who are NOT experts and may only have limited resources, for example, in countries with less well established healthcare services.",

In parallel explore simple measures that could aid individual users where personal ownership of items is easily maintained. Tracking of individual use and history may also be feasible in hospital settings, thereby enabling perhaps easier acceptance of recycled or re-conditioned items. 4. Best methods for recycling and re-sterilization based on comparative testing. What are the pro and cons of particular approaches? Such questions from the end user and medical community will evolve and must be dealt with. 5. Some of these areas will require close coordination between materials, medical/health, virology and bio-medical experts to achieve ongoing protection and anti-viral properties for reconditioned or recycled equipment.",
