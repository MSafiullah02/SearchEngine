            "text": "Globalization is a relatively new term, first appearing in the 1970s and quickly supplanting earlier concepts sharing roughly similar terrain (internationalization, postcolonialism, new international economic order). Broadly defined, globalization describes how nations, businesses, and people worldwide are becoming more connected and interdependent through increased economic integration and communication exchange, cultural diffusion, and travel. Lee (2002) further considers globalization to be effecting change in spatial, temporal, and cognitive dimensions: social activities increasingly transcend borders and occur more rapidly, as do peoples' understanding of global events and their place in the world. By such an account, globalization is not a new phenomenon; rather, apart from small and geographically isolated settlements, this push, prod, and sharing against \u2018borders\u2019 has characterized much of the history of human societies. At base, it is driven by economic and political expansion, whether by trade or conquest.",

Mercantilism dominated globalization's policies and practices over the next two centuries, as governments supported their local merchant class in competition for an expanding global trade facilitated by technological advances in maritime navigation. A series of late nineteenth-century economic recessions, rising social inequalities, staggering inflation, and nationalist protectionism became the fertile ground from which the Great War emerged, which devastation and lessons failed to find a sufficiently firm political foothold to avoid a recurrence in the Second World War. This foothold became more secure in the 30 years following the Second World War, which saw a new pattern in globalization emerge with the creation of stronger multilateral governance bodies. The United Nations (UN) replaced the League of Nations. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to maintain macroeconomic stability and avoid the recessionary crises underpinning both world wars. The World Bank (WB) was founded to finance reconstruction of war-torn Europe (and later, developing country economies and social infrastructure). The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provided a negotiating platform intended to interconnect national economies (at that time, of the high-income developed countries only) in mutually beneficial ways, with the expectation that this would also provide economic disincentives to future war.",

Some have argued that much of the improvement in global health during the last half of the twentieth century arose not from economic growth in developing countries, but from health technologies and knowledge transfers between wealthier (developed) and poorer (developing) countries (Deaton, 2003): one indication of globalization's health beneficence.",

Several of these conventions make specific reference to the right to health, and most others deal with rights associated with access to social determinants of health. Though sometimes critiqued for a perceived Western bias (emphasizing individual rather than collective rights) and for their lack of enforcement (apart from \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 states that fail to fulfill their obligations under these treaties), international human rights have become a set of global tools used in the struggle for better health throughout much of the world (Chapman, 2002). A global diffusion of concerns for gender equity has also been attributed to globalization, from increased funding to improve conditions for maternal/child health, to new employment opportunities in export-oriented industries allowing women to earn income outside patriarchal social structures. That the poor working conditions in these outsourced factories have become a focus of international and civil society activism attests to another distinguishing quality of contemporary globalization: the breadth and reach of digital communication technologies. These technologies enable not only the more exploitative elements of open markets but also the platforms for oppositional civil society mobilizations.",

International financing for health followed suit, increasing substantially over this period, partly on the accumulating evidence that health should be considered an investment in economic growth, rather than a cost (World Bank, 1993; CMH, 2001).",

Trade has also been responsible for the movements of insect or animal species destructive to natural resources essential for health (food, water, and biomass). Modern transportation allows such pathogens and pests to spread faster and farther, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the early 2000s shaking public health systems out of their recent complacency. New International Health Regulations monitored by the World Health Organization (WHO) followed quickly, as did ongoing \u2018pandemic preparedness\u2019 within and between countries and the \u2018securitization\u2019 of health within global governance structures (the WHO and the UN), wherein pandemic disease is viewed as a risk to national and international security (OUNHCHR, 2000). The global trade in fake medicines alongside the misuse of antibiotics in many countries, especially those that lack well-regulated public health systems, is heightening concern over the spread of multiple or extremely drug-resistant infections.",

The rise in NCDs, particularly problematic in many low- and middle-income countries still coping with infectious epidemics, is partly attributable to international trade and investment policies that are globalizing \u2018Western\u2019 lifestyles, including increased consumption of unhealthy products. The nutrition transition in many of these countries toward a low-nutrient, high-energy diet is occurring much faster and at earlier stages of development than it did in high-income countries (Popkin, 2009). Increased trade in tobacco and alcohol products, in turn, is associated with higher levels of consumption and health-related problems (Labont\u00e9 et al., 2011), at the same time that trade and investment treaties are being used by transnational companies (or governments on their behalf) to challenge public health restrictions on advertising, points of sale, taxation, and other measures now widely accepted as essential tools in health promotion.",

Policy capacity refers to the fiscal ability of states to enact those policies or regulations, which depends upon their ability to capture sufficient revenue through taxation for this purpose. The increasing \u2018behind-the-border\u2019 reach of an ever larger number of multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade and investment treaties is shrinking policy space by prohibiting a range of domestic regulatory options that could be used to promote more equitable population health outcomes. Although governments retain substantial policy flexibilities within existing trade treaties, these flexibilities continue to be eroded through ongoing negotiations, notably the shift to bilateral and regional treaty negotiations, which are often \u2018WTO+,\u2019 limiting policy space to a much greater extent than current WTO rules. Of particular concern is the proliferation of investor state dispute settlement provisions in bilateral and regional treaties, which allow corporations to sue governments for regulations that result in expropriation of their investments, with expropriation often defined in very broad terms. Anticipating the cost of such disputes can lead governments to choose not to exercise the health flexibilities that might still exist within these treaties: a \u2018regulatory chill.\u2019",

These tariff rates have come under intense trade negotiation pressures from high-income countries to be \u2018locked in\u2019 and rapidly reduced. In theory, governments should be able to shift their tax base from tariffs to sales or income taxes, assuming their economies grow with increased liberalization. In reality, most low- and middle-income countries subject to tariff reductions under structural adjustment loans from the IMF and WB were unable to do so (Baunsgaard and Keen, 2010), partly the result of inadequate institutions to implement alternate tax regimes. For a majority of these countries, there was a net decline in overall public revenues \u2013 a loss in policy capacity \u2013 with implications for spending in health, education, or public regulations that can affect primary and secondary prevention of disease.",

            "text": "At the same time that many countries saw their policy space and capacity erode under structural adjustment, a global reorganization of production was unfolding through the creation of \u2018export processing zones\u2019 (EPZs) in low- and middle-income countries. Industrial manufacturing previously centered in high-income countries began to outsource production to EPZs, which are tax-free and provide a low-paid and often minimally regulated workforce (Martinez, 2004). Most of the world's trade no longer occurs between nations, but between multiple subsidiaries of transnational companies. Much of the value added (and the profit) is captured by the firm at the top of the chain, often in offshore financial centers (\u2018tax havens\u2019), and often by way of relentless pressure on competing suppliers to bear most of the risk associated with investments in plant and equipment and to contain labor and other production costs. Corporations' ability to relocate production to lower cost jurisdictions limits the ability of workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions, and to expand social provision through the political process that was at the core of the postwar compromise between workers and capital in the high-income world. The result: \u2018most workers are being squeezed\u2019 (Woodall, 2006). This is occurring in all countries of the world. Even those in low- and middle-income countries who have seen their incomes rise as a result of the growth in global production chains live in conditions variously described as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 or \u2018precarious,\u2019 where their employment is often informal, temporary, part-time, or generally lacking in adequate remuneration, security, or benefits (Standing, 2011). Social protection programs can compensate, at least in part, for job and labor income losses that result from trade liberalization. However, given the extent of global market liberalization in capital, goods, and services, most of the world's governments find themselves converging on a policy model in which they strive to make their own geographic location as competitive as possible in international markets. Both labor market \u2018flexibilization,\u2019 with its stress-related health risks, and limits on the taxes that could finance improved health and social protection policies constitute important elements of competition state policies (Schrecker and Labont\u00e9, 2011).",

Some of this amount has since been repaid or recovered through sale of government shares in quasinationalized failed banks, although not without large public losses. Less evident but more systemic is the interest rate spreads on what governments and their central banks provide to banks and what they then borrow back to cover this lending, leading to a massive transfer of public wealth to the very institutions and individuals responsible for the GFC (Altvater and Mankopf, 2012).",

The GFC also accelerated a longer standing trend in rising wealth and income inequalities within and between most nations of the world, notwithstanding some notable exceptions in South America. Although still subject to empirical contestation, such inequalities have been argued to pose a number of health and social risks (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009).

The key tenets of austerity differ little from earlier structural adjustment (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). Unlike structural adjustment, the austerity agenda began in those high-income countries that were the epicenter of the GFC before becoming a more globalized set of policy prescriptions with fiscal contractions most severe in the developing world. Although there was little consensus among economists on the wisdom of pursuing austerity, the majority of IMF post-GFC loans pushed for elimination of food and fuel subsidies; wage bill cuts including salaries of education, health, and other public sector workers; rationalizing (reducing) safety net expenditures; and pension reform to delay eligibility. Several countries have been advised to reform their public health systems and increase labor market flexibilization, while many governments are attempting to generate revenue by broadening their consumption taxes to items disproportionately consumed by poor households (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013).",

From neoliberalism 1.0 (structural adjustment) to 2.0 (financialized economy) to 3.0 (austerity agenda), the rationale first proposed by Hayek \u2013 that the economy is too complex for government regulation and best left to an open, unfettered market with minimal state interference \u2013 has deepened and proved resilient even in the face of its failures. The present fiscal contraction of austerity is due, in no small measure, to decades of advice to developing countries by the international financial institutions (the IMF and WB) to keep taxes low to attract foreign investment, and tax cuts, notably among the high-income Anglo-American liberal economies and defended in the name of debt reduction and international competitiveness, that saw substantial declines the 1980s in marginal tax rates (paid by highest income earners) and corporate taxes, and increases in regressive consumption taxes. There would be no fiscal crisis and no need for austerity in most of the world's countries if progressive taxation had been retained. Even in those countries facing structural deficits, such as Greece, or reliant on aid transfers, such as many sub-Saharan African countries, liberalization of capital markets and global banking integration (including branches in all the world's tax havens) continue to allow companies and wealthy elites to avoid taxation almost altogether. The African continent has lost more wealth over the past 40 years in illicit capital flight, partly due to criminality and corruption but most of it involving commercial tax evasion, than it has received in foreign aid (African Development Bank, 2013).",

In times of recession, public spending yields far more economic return to the \u2018real economy\u2019 of production and consumption (through purchasing and employment) than do tax cuts intended to spur private sector investments. Conservative estimates of this fiscal multiplier find that every dollar in public spending generates between 1.6 and 1.7 dollars in economic growth (Stanford, 2013), with recent estimates of European public spending by sector showing much greater multiplier impacts for public investments in health, education, and environmental protection (Reeves et al., 2013). The WB and IMF are also now cautioning against \u2018extreme austerity\u2019 and calling for higher taxation rates, especially for \u2018ultrahigh-net-worth individuals.\u2019 In 2012, the world's 1426 billionaires between them had as much wealth (USD 5.4 trillion) (Forbes, 2013) as the entire continent of Africa (USD 2.3 trillion) and India (USD 3.2 trillion) (Shorrocks et al., 2012).

Similar findings exist for imposition of global taxation measures, such as a financial transaction tax that, by one study's estimate and if applied at a very low rate (.05%, or 5 cents on every 100 dollars) on every currency transaction, would generate over US $8 trillion in annual revenues (McCulloch and Pacillo, 2011).

            "text": "There is some evidence that WTO panels are increasingly accepting the importance and legitimacy of public health arguments in trade disputes, albeit only if there is no obvious trade discrimination involved. A 2010 case involving a tobacco dispute between Indonesia and the United States is illustrative. To comply with domestic legislation to prevent adolescent smoking, the United States banned imports of flavored cigarettes. Indonesia argued that the domestic legislation, by exempting \u2018menthol\u2019 from the list of flavors, discriminated against its clove cigarettes in favor of US-manufactured menthol cigarettes, which are the favored choice of American teens. This constituted a violation of WTO rules on national treatment (there should be no discrimination against \u2018like\u2019 imported goods). Indonesia further argued that there were \u2018less-trade-restrictive\u2019 ways (another WTO requirement) to meet the public health goal of reducing adolescent smoking than a ban on clove cigarette imports. The WTO dispute panel ruled with Indonesia on the first argument (nondiscrimination) but with the United States on the second (agreeing that a ban was a necessary public health policy). Provided there is no obvious discrimination, public health regulations appear to have growing latitude within (at least some) WTO (McGrady, 2012). There is also greater public health attention being given to proposed trade and investment treaties, with efforts to ensure that before such treaties are finalized, public health concerns are given due consideration, and that \u2018policy space\u2019 for future public health regulation is assured, e.g., regarding trade or investment in food, alcohol, or other health-damaging commodities. The potential for a healthier governance of trade and investment treaties, however, remains constrained by the secrecy in which the treaties are negotiated, the privileging of business interests over public interests in informing government positions during negotiations, and the still-dominant assumption that liberalization is an inherently positive development for all countries involved. As argued, this is not a universally held or observed assumption.",

The Initiative highlights the important role that a strong and strongly tax-supported social protection system can play in times of economic crises.

The Foreign Policy and Global Health initiative launched in 2006 by the foreign ministers of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand and renewed in 2011, as one example, encourages nations to broaden the scope of national foreign policies to integrate health concerns in a sustainable way and not as a crisis driven \u2018one-off\u2019 (Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 2007). Resolution 63/33 \u2018Global health and foreign policy\u2019 adopted by the UN General Assembly in November 2008 further recognizes the \u201cclose relationship between foreign policy and global health and their interdependence\u201d and urges \u201cmember States to consider health in the formulation of foreign policy\u201d (United Nations General Assembly, 2009). Several nations have pursued this aim through the development of coherent strategies (Labont\u00e9 and Gagnon, 2010) or efforts to create platforms for a \u2018health-in-all-policies\u2019 approach to their foreign affairs. Despite its recent global prominence, however, health is still not typically prioritized in the foreign policy agenda of most countries, and when it is, it is driven by traditional \u2018high politics\u2019 of security or economic risks due to pandemics or the spread of drug-resistant diseases. The continuing funding crisis of the WHO, and its reliance on extrabudgetary (nontithed) funding from governments and private sector donors for much of its operational budget, weakens its ability to provide leadership on global health governance initiatives that may go against the short-term interests of powerful nations or corporate actors (Vaughan et al., 1996).",
