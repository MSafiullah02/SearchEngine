These factors, together with the natural evolution of pathogens, are constantly leading to facilitate infections in humans, changing the nature of biological risks and increasing the global impact [3] . In particular, newly emerging infections refer to diseases that have been discovered in the human host for the first time (i.e. the severe acute respiratory syndrome -SARS-coronavirus, SARS-CoV) while reemerging infectious diseases can be defined as infectious diseases that reappear, usually in more pathogenic form and in rapidly increasing incidence or new geographic locations after apparent control or eradication (i.e. Filoviruses like Ebola and Marburg). 5 The field of emerging disease exploration has been strengthened by the creation of dedicated emerging diseases units and programmes at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 6 or at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). 7 These institutions monitor current infectious disease outbreaks, assess the risk to public health and provide technical support to the US/EU level-response to such threats.",

Twelve states have neither signed nor ratified the BWC (Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Israel, Kiribati, Micronesia, Namibia, Niue, Samoa, South Sudan and Tuvalu). 11 An analogous Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC, signed in 1993 and entered into force in 1997) incorporates a general clause prohibiting the weaponisation of all chemicals. After dedicated UN negotiates, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has been signed by 122 countries only recently (July 7th 2017, http://undocs.org/A/CONF.229/2017/8). 12 https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/bwcsig 13 National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), 2015.

In 2015, DARPA funded Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with $45 million to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola (a DNA-based vaccine against Ebola, a therapeutic DNA-based monoclonal antibody product and a conventional monoclonal antibody to treat Ebola). More recently, the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) of DARPA sponsored the 'Pandemic Prevention Platform' (P3) 15 program whose goal is to achieve an integrated capability that can deliver pandemic prevention countermeasures to patients within 60 days of an outbreak, changing outbreak response by enabling rapid discovery, characterization, production, and testing of efficacious medical countermeasures (i.e. generation of virus stock, including viral unknowns; rapid evolution of antibody candidates; gene-encoded antibody delivery methods).",

The idea is that, this capacity, once established, would mitigate the devastating effects of threats posed by highly pathogenic infectious diseases and bioterrorism events by rapidly detecting and transparently reporting outbreaks when they occur, and employing an interconnected global network that can respond effectively to limit the spread of infectious disease outbreaks in humans and animals, mitigate human suffering and the loss of human life, and reduce economic impact.",

It is based on a memorandum of understanding with the World Health Organization, (WHO), and has established a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, governments (like India, Germany, Japan, Norway), industry partners and private funders (i.e. Wellcome Trust), academic institutions and civil society organisations among others. According to the WHO 'R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics' (that indicates the priority pathogens against which the development of medical countermeasures are urgently needed) 19 and based on specific criteria (such as risk of an outbreak occurring, transmissibility of the pathogen, burden of disease, feasibility of vaccine development and the current pipeline candidates), as a first step, three diseases were selected (Lassa fever, Nipah virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) to move new vaccines from preclinical to proof of principle studies in humans. However, since there always will be an unknown or a not selected pathogen that it will not be possible to predict, CEPI aims also to support the development of rapid and adaptable vaccine technology platforms, where antigens from a new pathogen can substitute or be added to an existing vaccine.",

Lower manufacturing costs have been widely assumed as an intrinsic advantage of plant-based production platforms. Biologic production in plants does not require capital-prohibitive facilities, bioreactors, and expensive culture media but can be easily scaled in relatively inexpensive greenhouses with simple mineral solutions. Plants compete with other expression systems for reduced risks of contamination with human/animal pathogens and ability to perform eukaryotic posttranslational protein modification, such as glycosylation. There are differences in N-glycan and O-glycan structures between plants and mammals [15, 16] ; nevertheless, the possibility to control the glycosylation pattern ('glyco-engineering' or plant 'glyco-biotechnology') provides a method for producing proteins with unique and uniform mammalian post-translational modifications, resulting in biologics with increased efficacy with respect to their mammalian cell-produced counterparts ('bio-betters') [17] . 20 It officially entered in the plant science field in the year 2000 as a specific session at the 6th Congress in Plant Molecular Biology, Quebec, Canada.",

The aetiological agent of the syndrome, rapidly identified as a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), crossed the species barrier to infect humans, showing high morbidity and mortality rates. The end of the SARS outbreak was declared by WHO in July 2003. However, several local outbreaks were subsequently reported in China as a consequence of accidental laboratory contaminations or infections after contact with animals infected with SARS-CoV strains significantly different from those predominating in the 2002-2003 outbreak [30] . For its high transmissibility, high lethality and significant impact on the public health system, SARS-CoV has been defined a class C biological weapon (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [31] ). Currently, there are no approved antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV. Since a SARS epidemic may recur at any time in the future, it has been included in the WHO 'R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics' list and multiple therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV (and MERS-CoV) are currently under development [32] . A recent example of such efforts is represented by the nucleotide prodrug GS-5734 (currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease) that showed inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems and in a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis [33] . Another important key to prevent and control a future outbreak of SARS is to develop novel rapid and specific diagnostic methods, in addition to those already available 23 so that suspected patients can be correctly triaged and isolated.",

This turned out to be possibly true and induced a tumour-Specific Antigen (TSA)linked adaptive cell-mediated immunity (crucial for cancer resolution) [45, 46] . Recently, we developed a genetic vaccine where a plant protein signal sequence (ss-), was fused to the N-terminal portion of crucial viral antigens derived from the human papillomavirus type 16, HPV 16 (synthetic/fusion genes derived from E7 and L2 proteins) [47, 48] .",

In particular, the ss-L2 1-200 -E7 plasmid was able to produce the highest titers of both anti-L2 1-200 and anti-E7 IgGs.

Infection spread systemically from inoculated leaves to apical leaves, where typical PVX-infection symptoms appeared 7-10 days postinoculation. (c) Immunoblotting performed with a specific anti-N antibody showed the presence of the N protein (50 kDa) in both inoculated (lane 2) and symptomatic apical leaves (lane 4), but not in non-infected leaves (lane 3). The N protein produced in bacteria (lane 1) presents several degradation products (extra bands)",
