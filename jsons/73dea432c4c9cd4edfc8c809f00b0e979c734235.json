Here, we describe our experience in the initial month of the Covid-19 outbreak in New York City. Patients with confirmed Covid-19 who had ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography were included in the study from six New York hospitals. Patients with Covid-19 who had nonobstructive disease on coronary angiography or had normal wall motion on echocardiography in the absence of angiography were presumed to have noncoronary myocardial injury.",

The reference value for the troponin I level was 0.06 ng per milliliter or less. The reference value for the troponin T level was 0.01 ng per milliliter or less.
