            "text": "Viruses are a constant threat to humans, animals and plants. There are hundreds of viruses that can cause disease in humans but there is no treatment for most of them. Emerging or reemerging viruses are a public health concern (Howard and Fletcher, 2012). Some of these pathogens are the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Ebola virus (EBOV), SARS- and MERS-CoV, zika virus (ZIKV), Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and influenza A virus (IAV). Recent outbreaks of these viruses are summarized in Table 1\n. International travel and migrations, globalization of commerce, technology and industry, agriculture development or climate changes are favoring the emergence and reemergence of viruses that could easily spread and potentially become a pandemic (Jones et al., 2008). A clear example of the potential of an emerging virus to become a pandemic is the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s (http://aidsinfo.unaids.org/) (Sharp and Hahn, 2011). There is no cure for HIV, although antiretroviral treatment can control the virus (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 2013). In the case of influenza virus there are both vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, these viruses constantly change and antiviral resistance emerges (To et al., 2015). In 2013, human infections with a new avian influenza virus in China caused considerable concern due to the pandemic potential of this virus (Su et al., 2015). The experts consider that the virus could gain the ability to spread among people, triggering a global epidemic (Su et al., 2015; Tanner et al., 2015).",

The whole process from the discovery of a new drug that can potentially treat a specific disease or condition to its approval to be used in humans can take several years (on average 12 to 16 years) (Nosengo, 2016). The first stage, drug discovery, can take between 3 to 6 years. Then preclinical studies, usually in animal models, are carried out. These studies that are aimed to test the efficiency and safety of a molecule in a suitable model before it is tested in humans can go on for about 3 years. If a molecule has shown promising results up to here, then clinical trials in humans are started. These trials, from phase I to phase III, usually last about 5 years. Finally, if a molecule successfully passes all the process it needs to get the approval from the appropriate agency. At the end it is estimated that only about 5% of the candidate molecules successfully pass the whole process. Adding to this the cost of drug development, about 1\u20132 billion dollars or more in some cases (DiMasi et al., 2016), the one virus one drug strategy is not the most cost efficient approach. In addition, the use of DAAs can easily lead to the appearance of drug resistant viruses due to the elevated mutation rate of viruses (Iyidogan and Anderson, 2014; Menendez-Arias et al., 2014; Perales et al., 2015).",

Although viruses can also find ways to use alternative routes to replicate in a host, emergence of resistant viruses is less likely (Lin and Gallay, 2013; Zeisel et al., 2013). In addition these approaches focused in host cellular pathways needed for viral replication can favor the development of broad spectrum antivirals. There are families of viruses that share certain cellular pathways. Thus, drugs that inhibit a specific cellular target could work for several viruses. As a drawback drugs that inhibit a host cell target have higher chances of producing undesirable side effects in the patient compared to drugs that target a viral protein.",

            "text": "Drug repurposing or repositioning is an alternative approach that can lead to less costly and faster approval of new treatments for viral infections (Mercorelli et al., 2018). A clear advantage of drug repositioning over traditional drug development is that since the repositioned drug has already passed a significant number of tests, its safety is known and the risk of failure is reduced. Although repositioned drugs can most likely skip phase I clinical trials, they still need to go through phase II and III trials to test their efficacy for the new condition (Nosengo, 2016). In some instances these drugs might have lost their patents, as is the case of generic medicines. In these cases, when a new formulation or a new medical use exists for an \u201cold\u201d drug, second medical use patents can be obtained for them. On the other hand, increasing implication of practicing physicians and researchers at academic centers in clinical trials can also help in the repurposing of these drugs (Nosengo, 2016). Additionally, there are thousands of drugs that have already passed clinical trials that confirm their safe use in humans. However, for some reasons, they lack or have poor efficiency to treat the condition under scrutiny and have not reached the market. These collections of drugs are another source of potential antivirals. Several drugs in the market have been tested for their potential use as broad spectrum antiviral treatments (Table 2\n). Many of these compounds have shown promising results in preclinical studies. Below we summarize the main results and antiviral mechanisms of selected candidates for repositioning as broad spectrum antiviral drugs.",

Cardiac glycosides comprise a large family of natural compounds that share a common steroid structure. Digoxin was first isolated from foxglove plant, digitalis lanata, in 1930, although foxglove plant extracts have been used from ancient times to treat heart conditions (Gheorghiade et al., 2006). Digoxin has been shown to block the Na+/K+ ATPase, raising intracellular Na + levels. The increase in intracellular Na + leads to an increment in intracellular Ca2+ due to inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ ultimately leads to an increased contractibility of the cardiac muscle (Smith, 1988). Inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase has been shown to have an effect in multiple signaling cascades through modulation of neighboring tyrosine kinases, including src, ultimately affecting gene expression (Nesher et al., 2007). Thus, cardiac glycosides are in the spotlight for drug repurposing.",

Digoxin was shown to accomplish its antiretroviral effects by two mechanisms: 1) inducing oversplicing of HIV-1 RNA which reduces the accumulation of viral RNAs encoding for structural proteins needed for new virion assembly, and 2) selectively inhibiting the expression of HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev. These studies showed that digoxin exerted its anti-HIV effect by altering the function of a subset of SR proteins, a conserved family of serine and arginine-rich proteins involved in RNA splicing. A screening of a drug library for compounds inhibiting late steps of HIV-1 replication cycle also identified several members of the cardiac glycoside family (Laird et al., 2014).",

Intracellular trafficking of viruses relies on the endocytic and exocytic cellular pathways. These processes usually require signal transduction, suggesting that kinase inhibitors may have antiviral activity by blocking the endocytic or exocytic pathways. Binding of the HCV core protein to adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) \u03bc2 subunit (AP2M1) is essential for HCV assembly. Phosphorylation of AP2 by adaptor associated kinase (AKK1) and cycling G-associated kinase (GAK) regulate this interaction (Neveu et al., 2012, 2015). It has also been shown that AP1 and AP2 co-traffic with HCV viral particles within the cell (Bekerman et al., 2017). These studies showed that sunitinib prevents HCV entry and assembly, apparently through an inhibitory effect on AAK1 and GAK, with no effect on HCV RNA replication. Erlotinib, another anticancer drug, also inhibits HCV entry and assembly. Similarly, sunitinib and/or erlotinib can restrict infection by DENV and EBOV in vitro and in a murine animal model and have potent in vitro antiviral activity against ZIKV, WNV, CHIKV, Junin virus (JUNV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Bekerman et al., 2017; Pu et al., 2018).

On the one hand, many viruses use acidic endocytic vesicles, like endosomes or lysosomes, to enter the host cell. The acidification of these vesicles triggers conformational changes in the envelope proteins of the virus that induce the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and the delivery of the virion content into the cell. CQ raises the pH of these vesicles impeding the conformational changes needed for viral entry or uncoating and blocking the infection. CQ has also been shown to impair maturation of some viral proteins in the Golgi network by blocking the action of pH-dependent enzymes, like proteases or glycosyltransferases, which are needed for the maturation process. The antiretroviral effect of CQ in cell cultures has been shown to occur through the inhibition of the glycosylation of HIV viral particles (Savarino et al., 2004), while the antiviral activity of CQ against SARS-CoV seems to be related to the poor glycosylation of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 (Vincent et al., 2005). CQ has been reported to inhibit DENV replication by blocking the cleavage of the prM protein that occurs in acidic compartments (Boonyasuppayakorn et al., 2014; Randolph et al., 1990).",

Although in this study the therapeutic index of the drug in cell cultures was low, the results pointed at the potential use of CQ for the treatment of CHIKV infection. However, a clinical trial in the French Reunion Island during an outbreak of CHIKV to test the efficacy and safety of CQ treatment did not show evidence of a significant antiviral effect in CQ treated patients compared to placebo treated patients (De Lamballerie et al., 2008). This lack of antiviral effect could be due to the high viral load in the serum of patients during the acute phase of the infection. The rather narrow therapeutic index of CQ leaves little room for a dose adjustment that could allow the use of CQ as a therapeutic treatment in acute chikungunya infection. Nonetheless, in cell cultures, where the viral titer is lower, CQ strongly inhibits CHIKV infection at concentrations achieved in plasma of individuals on CQ treatment for malaria, which suggest that CQ could be used as a prophylactic treatment during chikungunya outbreaks to prevent transmission (Khan et al., 2010). However, a recent study in non-human primates showed that chloroquine treatment exacerbated the disease and/or suppressed the antiviral immunity in the chloroquine treated macaques compared to the placebo group (Roques et al., 2018).",

Although the immunosuppressive activity of CsA does not make it a good candidate for antiviral treatment, some CsA derivatives, like alisporivir, NIM811 and SCY-635, with reduced immunosuppressive properties that retain the ability to bind cyclophilin have been developed and proved to conserve the antiviral activity (Flisiak et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2016; Paeshuyse et al., 2006; Watashi et al., 2014).

The role of CypA in the viral cycle is unclear. Although it seems to act at several steps of the viral life cycle, the isomerase activity of CypA does not seem to be implicated (Liu et al., 2009). Overexpression of CypA inhibits M1 translocation into the nucleus (Liu et al., 2009) while depletion of CypA accelerated the replication of the virus (Liu et al., 2012b). Additionally CypA has been shown to increase degradation of M1 though the ubiquitin proteasome system (Liu et al., 2012b). The effect of CsA on influenza A virus infection has also been investigated. CsA-treated mice were administered a dose of influenza A virus that would be lethal for untreated mice, but they survived (Schiltknecht and Ada, 1985). CsA has also been reported to inhibit the propagation of several strains of influenza A virus in cell cultures blocking a late step of the replication cycle by mechanisms that might implicate CypA-dependent and \u2013independent pathways (Hamamoto et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012a; Ma et al., 2016).",

AgNPs are thought to interfere with virus-cell attachment and entry into the target cell or by directly inducing structural changes in the virion turning it non-infective (Elechiguerra et al., 2005; Xiang et al., 2013). Additionally, AgNPs can enter the cell and exert their antiviral activity by interfering with cellular proteins needed for viral replication or by direct interaction with viral proteins. Silver ions (Ag+) can react with thiols and phosphate groups present on proteins and nucleic acids inhibiting different steps of the replication cycle (Lara et al., 2010a). AgNPs formulated as topical vaginal gels could be used to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections like HIV and HSV. Studies in an in vitro system using human cervical tissue cultures that simulate in vivo conditions have shown encouraging results inhibiting HIV transmission (Lara et al., 2010b).",

The toxicity of AgNPs is highly related to the release of Ag+, which directly depends on the size of the nanoparticles. The smaller the size the higher the amount of Ag+ released. Ag+ has been reported to alter mitochondrial function (Chappell and Greville, 1954; Kone et al., 1988). Moreover, exposure of cells to AgNPs induce the production of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and JNK and p53 activation leading to mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis (Hsin et al., 2008). Therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the mode of action of AgNPs, their cell specificity and toxicological issues in order to generate new and more effective compounds as well as the use in combination with other drugs in the treatment of different viral diseases.",

CLEM is starting to show its potential for testing antivirals because changes in viral structures assembled in cells where the treatment was effective and in those where the antiviral drug failed can be now studied in detail (Berger et al., 2014; Lowen et al., 2018; Martinez et al., 2014).",

The strategy for these studies can be as follows: Duplicated cell cultures infected with a fluorescent virus and treated in the presence or absence of an antiviral drug are processed either by CLEM or cell sorting. Fluorescence microscopy will reveal interesting features in single cells that are then processed for ultrastructural analysis. Electron microscopy will show how viral structures are affected by the antiviral drug. In parallel, key cell factors involved in cell resistance to infection or in viral escape to the antiviral drug will be identified by comparing fluorescent and non-fluorescent cells separated by cell sorting and studied by proteomics, transcriptomics and lipidomics. For these studies, cells that differentiate into tissues and 3D organoids (Liu et al., 2013; Takebe et al., 2015; Walters et al., 2013) will provide more physiologically relevant cellular systems to study virus infection and to test antivirals.",

            "text": "Emerging viruses are a major threat to human health and the rate at which new pathogenic viruses are emerging has accelerated in the past fifty years. The frequent outbreaks have highlighted the urgent need for new antiviral treatments. Generally, antiviral drug development has focused on targeting viral components to block virus entry, replication, morphogenesis and propagation, or on the modulation of the host immune response (Zhu et al., 2015). Drug repurposing is an important alternative. In this review we have chosen several repurposed drugs with proven antiviral activity. With different mechanisms of action, digoxin, sunitinib, chloroquine, cyclosporine A and silver nanoparticles are promising candidates for broad spectrum antivirals that could be used in a combined antiviral therapy. Drug repurposing is now facilitated by a number of resources (Pollastri and Campbell, 2011), such as pathogen target bioinformatics resources, public data repositories of screening data, structural biology resources and compound collections, such as the library of small molecules from the National Institutes of Health (http://www.nihclinicalcollection.com) (Ashbrook et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2015) or the Canadian DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/), a large drug database commonly used by computational drug repositioning methods. DrugBank contains FDA approved drugs and those in clinical trials and is frequently updated with new information. With new and powerful screening assays and prediction tools, in silico structure-based screening of these large chemical libraries is identifying potential inhibitors of viral infections including repurposed compounds that target a variety of viral proteins and host factors (Abu Bakar and Ng, 2018; Barrows et al., 2016; Dowall et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2017). Another strategy that will surely reveal more promising candidates is based on comparing data from databases of pathogens (Brown and Patel, 2017; Sharma et al., 2015) with databases of drugs, e.g., drug information from the National Library of Medicine (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/learn-about-drugs.html). Imaging studies combined with functional assays will show the localization and intracellular effects of these new inhibitors (Panchal et al., 2010). Combination therapies with more than one drug against more than one target will be necessary to minimize problems of resistance to repurposed antiviral drugs.",
