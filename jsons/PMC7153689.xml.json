While, at the time of writing, China is the most affected country, the rate of infection in China has slowed down significantly; however, this is not the case in Italy or the United States, which are the second and third most affected countries, respectively. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, including Malaysia, have not been spared from COVID-19, although there have been fluctuations in the rate of infection demonstrated in the number of new cases and deaths reported in March 2020 (Table 1) (2). Barely three months after the first reported case, many countries have ordered lockdowns, including Malaysia. The Malaysian government announced an initial movement restriction order on 16 March 2020 and an extension to mid-April. These measure have been enacted for good reason. The trend in new cases does not appear to have peaked yet for Malaysia or other ASEAN countries (Figure 1) (3), although there have been fluctuations in the death rates (Figure 2) (1) perhaps due to different critical care capacities and resources in these countries.",

It is now spreading via human-to-human transmission with an average basic reproductive rate (R0) of 2.2. In other words, for each patient, 2.2 other individuals become infected (4). For comparison, the R0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was estimated at 3.0 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was less than 1.0. Based on the epidemiological data from Wuhan, there are several notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS and MERS: i) case fatality rates are lower; ii) asymptomatic spread can occur and iii) fever is more frequently absent (5). Gastrointestinal complaints are uncommon among COVID-19 patients but loss of smell and loss of taste have been increasingly reported as early signs of infection. Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is a severe complication, and typical computed tomography (CT) features include ground-glass and consolidative opacities in the periphery (6). However, it must be borne in mind that SARI can also be a manifestation of respiratory illnesses with other infectious or non-infectious causes, which need to be ruled out before attributing the presence of SARI to COVID-19.",

Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), provide the earliest and most accurate diagnosis, but they are costly and time consuming (7). Point-of-care tests, e.g. lateral flow assays for the detection of antibodies are more ideal in the field; however, these tests are of limited value due accuracy issues and the time required to obtain a diagnosis. Rapid antigen detection tests are still undergoing evaluation, and their efficacy is yet to be proven.

For upper respiratory specimens, the viral Ribonucleic acid yield from nasopharyngeal swabs seems to offer more accurate results than oropharyngeal swabs. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is also detectable in blood, urine and stool; such specimens are not as reliable for diagnosis but are important from the transmission point of view. Proper transport and handling of specimens is necessary to ensure the integrity of the viral RNA and, hence, the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Adherence to biosafety practices is essential, and any testing should be performed in appropriately equipped laboratories by staff trained in the relevant technical and safety procedures (World Health Organization, 2020) (8). Non-propagative diagnostic laboratory work should be conducted at a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facility, whereas propagative work, including virus culture and isolation, should be conducted at a containment laboratory with inward directional airflow (BSL-3). Virus isolation is not routine but necessary for characterisation and to support the development of vaccines and other therapeutic agents.",

Furthermore, other issues should be addressed by hospitals through a management protocol or algorithm in place for frontline workers (10). For example, although many resources are being diverted to the frontlines and critical care, they will be inadequate during the height of the pandemic. Thus, there is an ethical but pragmatic challenge in the allocation of critical resources, such as intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators (11). Age is often the sole criterion used for decision-making regarding ventilation, which can be morally difficult for people in general. Therefore, it is imperative that such decisions be made by a different team, and that the triage algorithm be reviewed regularly.",

In Malaysia, where social gathering is a norm, the initial days of the movement restriction order have been extremely difficult but necessary so that containment measures could be put into place quickly. The current mitigation phase is critical in order to create a small window of opportunity to break the transmission of the virus to the larger community.

For healthcare workers, the pandemic is exposing them to long-term stressors, which could impact their wellbeing (22) and lead to burnout due to increased job demands (such as increased workload and role conflicts) and reduced job resources which lead to loss of workplace control and autonomy (23). Early mitigation and psychological crisis interventions are already in place in Malaysia. Several government and non-governmental agencies are offering psychological first aid to the public through tele-counselling and hotline services. These interventions should be continued even after the pandemic is over, as data has shown that those who are affected by a pandemic still have varying degrees of stress disorders even after the event ends or they recover from the disease (24). In addition, clear information about the disease and progress updates on the situation could reduce the psychological impacts of COVID-19 among the public (20).",
