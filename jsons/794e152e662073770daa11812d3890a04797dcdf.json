However, despite intensive investigation, no single infectious agent or group of agents has been identified. 'Demonstrating Infectious Cause: Viral and Bacterial Infections in MS and Related Disorders' brought together immunologists, virologists, epidemiologists and clinicians to review the current knowledge about the role of infectious agents in MS, and to identify key concepts and questions for research.",

Although it is now well accepted that inflammatory responses often have non-infectious causes, there are a number of clues that point towards an exogenous, possibly infectious, factor or factors as an important component of MS. For example, studies of twins with MS indicate that monozygosity is associated with a disease concordance of ~35% which, although suggesting a strong genetic component (the concordance for dizygotic twins is in the order of 4%), also indicates that the disease is influenced by additional, possibly environmental, factors. Furthermore, there is a strong geographical influence on MS prevalence: the rates range from 150-250 per 100 000 in northern Europe and in the northernmost USA, whereas in southern Europe the prevalence drops to ~40 per 100 000, similar to the rates in the southern USA.",

Detectable as 'oligoclonal' bands in electrophoresed samples of concentrated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, antibodies produced by plasma cells within the CNS are usually seen in infectious diseases such as syphilis or AIDS, where they are directed against antigenic components of the invading microorganism. Their presence and persistence in MS (Ref. 2) suggests that a chronic infection underlies the clinical syndrome, although it is also possible that these antibodies are directed against as-yet-unidentified self-antigens. Additionally, analysis of tissue samples from around the plaques themselves also indicates antibody production and deposition. Most investigators believe that identification of the antigens against which these antibodies are directed will provide important information about MS, perhaps even identifying its cause. Although there were calls from conference 'break-out' sessions for better stratification of MS patients in epidemiological studies, the consensus of studies pointing in the direction of an environmental cause, as well as the evidence from the oligoclonal immune responses, convinced the majority of delegates that MS is likely to be caused or triggered by an infectious agent.",

These immunoglobulins can then be specifically amplified, and the antigen against which they are directed can subsequently be identified.

Sriram was also able to culture C. pneumoniae from the CSF of MS patients. Furthermore, oligoclonal bands from MS CSF were adsorbed by incubation of the fluid with a C. pneumoniae antigen, but not with antigens from herpes simplex or measles viruses. These data support his view that the immune response in those patients was directed against C. pneumoniae.

Immunohistochemical analysis of MS plaques has revealed a concentration of an HHV-6 antigen in oligodendrocytes, the CNS cells responsible for the formation and maintenance of myelin (myelin destruction is a key component of the MS lesion). Knox and collaborators found HHV-6 expression in 17 out of 19 patients with 'active' disease, compared with only three out of 23 patients with 'inactive' MS. There were also dramatic differences in viremia. Twenty seven out of 41 patients with MS had active HHV-6 viremia, compared with none of the 61 controls. Other investigators presented data supporting potential roles for human endogenous retroviruses (Herve Perron, Biomerieux SA, Lyon, France), and delayed exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (Tove Christensen and Sven Haar, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark) as potential triggers 4, 5 . However, as with many such reports, in most individuals there is evidence of prior or current infection with these agents whether or not they have MS, and there are no moredefinitive tests such as viremia or analysis of oligoclonal bands to differentiate patients with MS from those with other diseases. Further research will be needed in order to clarify and reconcile these potentially conflicting findings, as several presentations outlined an association with a specific agent in over half of the cases.",

Several animal models of virally induced demyelination, particularly those associated with murine coronaviruses or with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), support such an idea. In these models, demyelination is related to the presence of an identified virus within the CNS; in TMEV-mediated disease, the extent of demyelination depends not only on viral load but also on a locus on mouse chromosome 11 (Michel Brahic, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France).

In some of these, the microorganism might no longer be present by the time the disease manifests but, for example, it affects the CNS by changing the intrathecal cytokine environment and promoting pro-inflammatory reactions or by stimulating autoreactive T cells. Matthias Von Herrath (Scripps Clinic, San Diego, CA, USA) indicated that, in an autoimmune diabetes model, the growth kinetics of different strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus determined whether the disease was exacerbated by a second peripheral challenge or whether this was, in fact, protective. Balances between immune reactions also produce different responses in Borna virus infection in rats (Luther Stitz, Institute of Animal Health, T\u00fcebingen, Germany). One of the more popular arguments has been that a microorganism could stimulate an autoimmune response by mimicking an endogenous antigen (antigenic mimicry) (Uwe Liebert, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Henry McFarland, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA); circumstantial evidence indicates that such a mechanism could lead to the development of autoimmune, reactive T-cell clones 6, 7 .

Macrophage activation, which is likely to occur within a granuloma, is the key to controlling TB. Granulomas consist of macrophages and lymphocytes, but the role(s) of each cell type, the types and kinetics of the cytokines produced by different cell populations, and the evolution of the granuloma remain poorly understood. Murine studies have revealed essential roles for certain cytokines, including interferon \u2425 (IFN-\u2425), interleukin 12 (IL-12) and tumour necrosis factor \u2423 (TNF-\u2423). However, there is little data regarding the importance of these cytokines in human TB. Humans with mutations in the genes encoding IFN-\u2425 or IL-12, or their receptors, often succumb to mycobacterial infections other than TB (Ref. 9). Although it is probable that these cytokines are significant in human TB, their relative importance, specific roles and cellular targets remain less clear.",

However, because most infected individuals harbor the organism for many years, perhaps for a lifetime, this response is apparently not completely effective in eliminating virulent M. tuberculosis. In fact, in vitro, it has been difficult to demonstrate IFN-\u2425-induced killing of M. tuberculosis within human macrophages, although similarly activated macrophages eliminate other intracellular pathogens. A recent study has shed some light on this phenomenon 10 However, the infection dramatically inhibits the association of the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1) with the transcriptional coactivators CBP [cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein] and p300, an association that is essential for IFN-\u2425-induced transcription. Live bacteria are not necessary for this effect, as it can be reproduced using cell walls and it does not appear to be mediated by lipoarabinomannan. Neutralization of transforming growth factor \u2424 (TGF-\u2424) or IL-10 did not reverse the effects of M. tuberculosis infection, suggesting that these cytokines are not the only contributors to macrophage deactivation. This phenomenon might also occur in mice, because mice do not eliminate M. tuberculosis, even though a strong immune response involving both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells and production of IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and other cytokines is present.",
