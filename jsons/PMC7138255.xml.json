Major transmission hotspots were brought under control in China, but subsequently others sprouted across the globe. Since late February, 2020, the daily number of new cases has been higher in other parts of the world. New major epicentres have established in South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy. By mid-March, 2020, Europe was declared the world's major epicentre.",

A differentiated risk-based containment strategy is needed based on the different stages of the outbreak, with different measures during the different phases of the response. Countries with no or few identified cases and only limited local transmission need to invest in aggressive case detection by testing for COVID-19 in all atypical pneumonias and all cases of acute respiratory infection. A wide net should be cast on contact tracing with legally enforced implementation. Singapore managed to contain COVID-19 with such measures but without lockdown or major social disruption by maximising all efforts to interrupt new transmission chains and keeping clusters under control.3 Countries with widespread community transmission need to follow the China approach, with wide-reaching (and possibly unpopular) mobility restrictions, limited social interaction, and cancelled gatherings. People should be strongly encouraged to stay home and work from home when possible. In addition, all countries need to continue liberal testing, proactive case detection, prompt isolation, rigorous contact tracing, and enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, irrespective of which phase of the outbreak they are in.",

This includes fully engaging the public on the seriousness of, and their role in, the response. Policy makers need to ensure that trained epidemiology teams are in place, along with quarantine facilities, revised hospital workflows, and laboratory processes (who to test, how, and in which laboratory). Surveillance needs to be expanded to test all patients with atypical pneumonias for COVID-19, and COVID-19 testing needs to be added to existing surveillance systems for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. The demand on facilities, the number of test kits, personal protective equipment, and medication stockpiles should be forecast to enable scale-up. Health systems vary whereby people in under-resourced countries will be particularly at risk. Vulnerable countries will therefore need extraordinarily intensified support from other countries. WHO freely provides online resources that include training courses, downloadable standardised case report forms, guidance on clinical management and infection control, protection of health-care workers, and many other technical guidance documents.",
