            "text": "These findings suggest that the IgM antibodies to SARS\u2010CoV persist for a much shorter period of time than IgG, as would be expected. The prolonged production of IgG suggests that, not only does it play a principal role in the humoral immune response against acute SARS\u2010CoV infection, but also plays a crucial part in cleaning up residual virus during the recovery phase. Shi et al. have similarly shown that the activity of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV IgG remains active on day 210 after onset.\n11\n Recently, Woo et al. reported on the use of recombinant SARS\u2010CoV, nucleocapsid protein, ELISA\u2010based antibody tests for the serodiagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV pneumonia.\n16\n They showed that all convalescent patients (from whom serum samples were available) were still positive for anti\u2010nucleocapsid protein IgG antibody on day 240 following the onset of illness. This study is the first to describe the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV in SARS patients up to 720 days after the onset of illness. The patients\u2019 IgG titres still remained positive on day 720 following the onset of symptoms, although their average titre was close to the cut\u2010off value for positivity (1:10).",

            "text": "The virus neutralization test is a sensitive and specific assay applicable to the identification of virus\u2010specific antibody in animals and humans. The novel finding in this study is the demonstration of neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera of SARS patients by the inhibition of CPEs of SARS\u2010CoV on Vero\u2010E6 cells. All patients but one showed positive neutralization effects on day 540 and 720 after the onset of illness. This is an important observation as the presence of these antibodies may be necessary for the recovery of the patients as well as for the prevention of reinfection by SARS\u2010CoV. However, this protective effect may not be permanent and may decline or even disappear over a period of 2 years, suggesting an appropriate vaccine may be necessary at that time.",
