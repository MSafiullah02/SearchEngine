These clusters are enormously varied, ranging from highly basic sequences (as in the effector domain of the MARCKS protein) to highly aromatic sequences (as in the scaffolding domain of caveolin).

Basic and aromatic amino acids are common elements in these domains responsible for specific membrane binding and penetration. A general model for protein\u2013lipid interactions in these systems is one where non-specific electrostatic interactions mediate the initial contact with the membrane, and hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids penetrate into the membrane interface. Many of the domains recognize specific lipids, which upon binding induce a conformational change in the domain that releases conserved aromatic residues buried within the protein for membrane penetration.",

The depth of penetration is often to the hydrocarbon core of the membrane. Membrane penetration is the hallmark of a series of small peptides that have been shown to cross through cell membranes without the aid of receptors [25], [26] and without forming stable pores. The general model for membrane penetration by these peptides involves non-specific binding followed by local disruption of the membrane. These peptides have gained considerable attention for their potential in drug delivery. They have been identified in normal cellular proteins, such as penetratin or the Antennapedia homeodomain [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], and have been designed de novo [32].",

However, McLaughlin and co-workers found that labeling MARCKS(151\u2013175) with Texas-Red, a large hydrophobic fluorescent label, allows the peptide to rapidly penetrate the outer membranes of giant vesicles [36]. As with the other cell permeant peptides, the detailed mechanism is not known [28], [37]. However, Cunningham et al. [38] observed that attaching a hydrophobic fluorescent probe, rhodamine B, to a basic peptide corresponding to a region of gelsolin allows the peptide to cross the cell membrane as well. In contrast, attaching a hydrophilic fluorescent label (Alexa-488) to the MARCKS(151\u2013175) peptide does not confer cell permeation. It is important to note that many of the studies described in this review make use of large hydrophobic fluorescent labels to track the location of peptides with basic-aromatic clusters. These labels are generally aromatic systems, much like tryptophan, and the observations on their ability to facilitate membrane permeation emphasizes the importance of aromatic residues in basic\u2013aromatic clusters, as well as raising a concern about how these fluorescent tags influence the behavior of the labeled peptide.",

The general model for membrane fusion involves the insertion of hydrophobic segments into the two membranes to be fused (e.g. vesicle membrane and plasma membrane).

The viral envelope proteins that mediate fusion have two regions that interact with cell membranes, an N-terminal fusion peptide rich in glycines and aromatic amino acids, and a single transmembrane domain connected to a juxtamembrane region containing a basic-aromatic cluster. The transmembrane segment anchors the envelope protein to the viral membrane, while a fusion-induced conformational change allows the fusion peptide to insert into the host cell membrane [65]. Crystal structures of the soluble ectodomains of several fusion proteins [66] suggest that the long hydrophilic sequence intervening between these hydrophobic segments serves to bring the host and viral membranes into close proximity. In both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type I [67] and the coronavirus [68], the aromatic-rich juxtamembrane region has been implicated in the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. The predicted structure of these fusion proteins at the transmembrane-juxtamembrane boundary is remarkably similar to the mammalian SNARE proteins. Solid-state and solution NMR studies on fusion peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 protein [69] and the influenza hemaglutinin protein [70] have suggested how membrane binding may lead to local disruption of the host cell membrane.",

There is a similar requirement for curvature in the formation of membrane vesicles. For example, endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles are one of the best characterized systems that have highly curved membranes [71]. There are several clathrin binding proteins (epsin, amphiphysin, and endophilin) that have the ability to induce curvature in membrane vesicles without clathrin [72]. Epsin induces curvature via an amphipathic \u03b1-helix that inserts into the cytosolic leaflet of the lipid bilayer via a PI(4,5)P2-dependent mechanism [73]. Amphiphysin and endophilin induce curvature primarily through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged concave surface of a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and the negatively charged membrane. BAR domains form \u2018banana-shaped\u2019 dimers with clusters of basic residues on the concave surface [74], [75]. Interestingly, several BAR domains have an amphipathic helix at their N-terminus, which increases their ability to induce membrane curvature [76]. Lee et al. [77] have recently shown that the N-terminal amphipathic \u03b1-helix (MAGWDIFGWFRDVL) of Sar1p inserts into membranes and induces synthetic vesicles to form narrow tubules. Sar1p is a small GTPase and one of five core COPII proteins in COPII-coated transport vesicles. Substitution of the Trp or Phe residues with alanine within the amphipathic \u03b1-helix of Sar1p blocks its ability to generate highly curved membranes.",

These cholesterol-rich lipid rafts appear to segregate and concentrate membrane proteins [83], [84], [85]. Proteins with basic-aromatic clusters have been found to bind strongly to cholesterol-containing rafts raising the question of whether these proteins serve to nucleate microdomain formation in cells or whether existing lipid rafts tend to recruit proteins with basic\u2013aromatic clusters [86]. Anderson has suggested that cholesterol-rich domains can form in membranes as a consequence of preferential sequestration of particular lipids as a shell surrounding membrane bound proteins [87]. For example, he suggests that when the MARCKS effector domain binds to membranes and recruits negatively charge lipids, these lipids associate with cholesterol to create a lipid shell.",

An important question is whether these properties are simply a manifestation of the same property inherent in any basic-aromatic cluster or whether they are independent. Nieva and co-workers [92] addressed this question by comparing the juxtamembrane sequence of HIV-1 gp41 (DKWASLWNWFNITNWKWYIK) with a sequence where the first three tryptophans are replaced by alanines.

Oldfield and co-workers were the first to fully recognize that high resolution 1H spectra of lipid membranes could be obtained using MAS [99], while Cafiso and co-workers pioneered the use of NOESY methods combined with MAS to investigate the structure of lipid membranes [100], [101]. The high resolution 1H NOESY-MAS approach has subsequently been extended to characterize the location of a wide range of small hydrophobic molecules in membrane bilayers [102], [103] and to investigate the structure and location of both membrane-associated and transmembrane peptides [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109].",

The resonance at 3.4 ppm marked with an asterisk results from the \u03b2-CH2 group of the phenylalanine side chain. The short (50 ms) mixing time limits spin diffusion and the spectrum indicates that the aromatic side chain is located in the region of the choline head group, as expected. When the mixing time is increased to 300 ms (Fig. 3b), additional intense resonances occur at 4.7 and 1.3 ppm, which are assigned to water and the lipid acyl chain CH2 resonances, respectively.

Fig. 5\npresents rows at the position of the aromatic proton resonances from 2D MAS-1H NOESY spectra of MARCKS(151\u2013175) bound to DMPC:DMPG model membranes. As above, the NOESY spectra were obtained with mixing times of 50 ms (a) and 300 ms (b). Remarkably, the 50 ms spectrum exhibits an intense cross peak between the aromatic protons and the lipid acyl chain protons. These data indicate that the aromatic rings of the phenylalanines penetrate the model membrane to below the level of the acyl chain carbonyls. The location of the MARCKS effector domain deep in the membrane is supported by EPR measurements of Cafiso and co-workers [111]. Importantly, replacing the five phenylalanine residues in the MARCKS(151\u2013175) peptide with alanines shifts the equilibrium binding position of the peptide more than 10 \u00c5 so that it resides in the aqueous phase [112]. It is estimated that the deep penetration of the aromatic rings of the five phenylalanines increases the affinity of MARCKS(151\u2013175) with bilayer membranes by a factor of 10\u2013100 [23], [111], [113].",

The slight negative curvature for the buildup curve of the phenylalanine methyl ester suggests that magnetization transfer between the aromatic protons and the lipid acyl chains results from spin diffusion [107].

Phenylalanine has a much higher occurrence in the transmembrane segments of membrane proteins than either tyrosine or tryptophan [5]. In an elegant study on the preferred position of Trp and Phe in membrane bilayers, Braun and von Heijne [114] found that Phe, but not Trp, is accommodated in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer when inserted into a poly-Leu transmembrane helix. Moreover, measurements on the partitioning of benzene into bilayers shows that there is no preference for benzene partitioning into either the interfacial or hydrophobic core regions of the bilayer [115], [116].",

The aromatic amino acids in basic-aromatic clusters may influence the electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface [110] by dragging the positive charge on the flanking lysine and arginine side chains deeper into the polar head group so they can interact more effectively with the negative lipid charges (e.g. on the PI(4,5)P2 or phosphotidylglycerol (PG) head groups). The electrostatic potential extending from the positively charged residues would be expected to increase substantially as the charge approaches the low dielectric membrane surface. Electrostatic calculations on a simple ion of charge q at an idealized membrane-water interface show that if ions are excluded from the membrane phase, then the potential at the membrane interface extends much further than it would for the same charge in bulk water [119]. In fact, the electrostatic potential at a distance r from an ion at a low dielectric interface is twice that predicted by Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel theory for an identical ion in the bulk aqueous phase. This increase in electrostatic potential enhances the ability of the basic\u2013aromatic peptides to sequester PI(4,5)P2. For example, MARCKS(151\u2013175) is able to electrostatically sequester PI(4,5)P2 with high selectivity (\u223c1000 fold) over monovalent acidic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine [120]. The high selectivity is predicted from the high valence (\u22124) of PI(4,5)P2 and the Boltzmann factor associated with the MARCKS(151\u2013175)\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction [80].",

Structural studies of membrane bound peptides have exploited the orientational dependence of 15N chemical shifts and 15N\u20131H dipolar couplings. Several reviews are available on these methods [41], [121]. The structure determination of gramicidin A in membrane bilayers was a tour de force of solid-state NMR spectroscopy using this approach [44]. This approach has also been applied to the M2 peptide studies by Cross and co-workers [122]. M2 has a hydrophobic transmembrane helix and N-terminal amphipathic helix containing a basic-aromatic cluster. The amphipathic helix lies approximately parallel to the surface of the membrane with several phenylalanines penetrating into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Hong and co-workers have used 13C and 15N chemical shifts to determine the orientation of protegrin 1 in lipid bilayers [123]. The orientation favors interaction of the hydrophobic backbone of the peptide with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer and positions the cationic arginine side chains to interact with the anionic phosphate groups.",

The DMPC and DMPG lipids have slightly different lineshapes giving rise to the observed splitting in the static spectrum.

In contrast, the DMPG resonance changes from \u22121.74 to \u22120.27 ppm, moving closer to the resonance from DHPC. The dramatic shift of the 31P resonance of DMPG can be caused by a change in the orientation of the DMPG head group or by a change in the local electrostatic environment. The 31P MAS spectrum of unoriented membrane bicelles is very similar to that shown for DMPC:DMPG (dashed line) in Fig. 7, which means that the 31P chemical shift is not due to local electrostatic interactions.

Most gene mutations that are associated with the inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease cause an increase in the ratio of A\u03b242 over shorter A\u03b2 peptides. APP is cleaved at Asp672 in the extracellular domain by \u03b2-secretase and at Ala713 within the transmembrane domain by \u03b3-secretase [137], [138]. The mechanism of toxicity has been variously attributed to the formation of ion pores [139], [140], [141], [142], direct destabilization of membranes [143], [144], [145], [146] or to permeation through neuronal cells and inhibition of cellular enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase [147].

Binding of A\u03b242 results in a broadening of the 31P linewidths with the most dramatic change occurring for DMPG. However, the chemical shifts of the 31P resonances do not change dramatically indicating that the bilayer structure of the bicelles remains intact. Consistent with these results, Seelig and co-workers [148] used 31P NMR of membrane vesicles to show that the bilayer structure is not disrupted by the A\u03b240 peptide. Moreover, using 2H NMR they found no change in the conformation of the choline headgroup or in the ordering of the hydrocarbon chains. As a result, they concluded that A\u03b240 binds electrostatically to the outer envelope of the polar headgroup region without penetrating the membrane interface.",

In 2D 31P-EXSY solid-state NMR spectra, cross-peak intensity appears when there is a change of orientation during the mixing time. The \u03b2-purothionin protein is found to decrease the lateral diffusion of the DMPG and may act as an obstacle to the lipid diffusion. Auger and co-workers also suggest that the presence of \u03b2-purothionin significantly modifies the lipid packing at the surface of the bilayer, which in turn increases the accessibility of water molecules in the interfacial region.",

The peptide strongly perturbs the polar head group region in order to penetrate into the acyl chain region of the membrane. As the aromatic rings become buried in the hydrophobic core of the membrane, the lipid head groups are pushed aside by the backbone and the side chains of the peptide. Monolayer studies demonstrate that the increase in the surface pressure is small (0.3 mN/m) for \u223c1 MARCKS(151\u2013175) peptide bound per 100 lipids, but increases markedly as the number of peptides bound per unit area increases. Hence binding would be expected to result in significant membrane curvature in regions of the cell membrane where MARCKS is concentrated. Membrane curvature is critical for endocytotic vesicle formation, a process that is often mediated by proteins that specifically interact with PI(4,5)P2\n[155]. MARCKS is concentrated in regions of cells associated with inward curvature, such as the nascent phagosomes of macrophages [156], [157]. The combination of 31P with 1H and 2H NMR (below) may be sufficient to distinguish between membrane curvature and local membrane disruption.",

This observation is consistent with the sequestration of cholesterol by the MARCKS(151\u2013175) peptide since binding of MARCKS(151\u2013175) to DMPC:DMPG:cholesterol membranes should actually increase the observed quadrupolar splittings if cholesterol were not sequestered. This conclusion is supported by 1H NOESY-MAS measurements that show the MARCKS(151\u2013175) peptide inserts as deeply into DMPC:DMPG membranes containing cholesterol as it does into membranes without cholesterol (unpublished results).",

The deep penetration of the MARCKS peptide due to the aromatic groups may be responsible for cholesterol sequestration since parallel experiments with pentalysine show no change in the deuterium quadrupolar splittings (unpublished results). The sequestration may be a response to the local disruption of the bilayer (where the cholesterol is somehow filling in the gaps in the membrane created by peptide binding) or may be due to an interaction with the negatively charged PG lipids that are attracted to the positively charged MARCKS (as suggested by Anderson [87] in his lipid-shell mechanism for membrane domain formation).",

This review only scratches the surface of what may be one of the least understood areas of cell biology. Besides simply binding to membranes and inducing a change in structure, the interactions of basic\u2013aromatic clusters with membranes are often regulated. For instance, membrane interactions of many proteins, including MARCKS, are regulated by phosphorylation. In MARCKS, phosphorylation of serine residues within its basic-aromatic cluster introduces a negatively charged phosphate that lowers the binding affinity of the cluster for negatively charged membranes. The binding of other basic-aromatic clusters is regulated by protein-protein interactions, such as interaction with Ca2+-calmodulin [24]. As a result, the cell biology that relies on the specific ways that proteins influence membrane structure is both complex and dynamic. NMR methods that provide high-resolution information on both structure and dynamics are well suited for these types of systems. The membrane environment is an integral part of the system and consequently these problems are not amenable to protein crystallography.",

One of the themes that emerges from this review is that the structure of the basic-aromatic cluster often determines the mechanism of membrane binding and interaction. Basic-aromatic clusters can be contained in amphipathic helices, \u03b2-sheets, and structure loops, as well as being part of natively unstructured proteins. Moreover, the secondary structure of the cluster can be induced upon membrane binding. It is important to note that besides secondary structure, the function of basic-aromatic clusters often depends on the tertiary and quaternary structure (or oligomeric state) of the peptides or proteins involved. In addition, local cation-\u03c0 interactions between the positively charged side chains of basic amino acids and the aromatic rings of Trp, Phe and Tyr may play a role in the ability of basic residues to partition into the membrane interface. NMR has a tremendous advantage over CD and IR spectroscopy in terms of establishing to high resolution the local structure and the interactions of basic-aromatic clusters in lipid bilayers.(ii)\nMembrane structure. There is a vast body of literature on using 31P and 2H NMR to characterize the structure and dynamics of lipid membranes. The challenges posed by the complex and dynamic nature of membranes and how they respond to membrane-associated proteins is illustrated in the three examples presented in the 31P section: MARCKS, AntP, and A\u03b242. These proteins all contain basic and aromatic residues, yet binding to membrane bilayers results in each case in unique changes in the 31P spectrum. These changes likely originate from electrostatic interactions between the basic amino acids and the negatively charged DMPG lipids. However, the nature of the interactions must be different for the different basic-aromatic clusters.(iii)\nLipid\u2013protein interactions. There is also a substantial literature on using NMR to characterize lipid\u2013protein interactions. Over the past few years there has been a resurgence of interest in how membrane proteins influence membrane structure, and a recognition that the interactions can be subtle and specific. Biophysics has much to offer in way of understanding the cell biology that relies on these interactions. Moreover, cell membranes are increasingly being viewed as protein-rich environments able to form distinct microdomains that direct cellular processes. The recent proposal by Anderson [87] that lipid shells are involved in the formation of microdomains in membranes is an excellent example. The challenge for the future is to develop NMR approaches that move beyond model systems and capture the complexity and dynamics of cellular membranes.\n",
