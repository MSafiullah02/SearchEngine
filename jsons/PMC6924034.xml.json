            "text": "Diarrhea is one of the most important causes of death in young piglets and can be evoked by viruses, bacteria and parasites. Rotaviruses are considered as the most important pathogens that cause diarrhea in piglets and children. They belong to the genus rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. It consists of a triple-layered capsid encapsulating a genome consisting of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that encodes six structural (VP1\u2013VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non-structural (NSP1\u2013NSP6) proteins. Each gene segment encodes one viral protein, except for gene segment eleven which encodes NSP5 and NSP6. In vivo, rotavirus infects primarily mature enterocytes in the polarized intestinal epithelium. Many studies on rotavirus biology have been conducted in nonpolarized cultures of MA104 cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells), or intestinal epithelial cell lines IPEC-J2 and Caco-2 cells, since they are most permissive for replication of some genotypes of rotavirus strains [1\u20135]. However, there are still a lot of rotavirus strains that do not grow in these cells [6, 7]. Therefore, it is necessary to have a culture system of intestinal enterocytes for the investigation of rotavirus replication mechanisms.",

More recently, histo-blood group antigens have been reported to mediate the attachment of rotavirus strains [12\u201314].

            "text": "Tight junctions are essential for establishing a barrier between different compartments of the body. Their primary physiological role is to function as paracellular gates which restrict diffusion on the basis of size and charge. The main protein components of the transmembrane strands are proteins of the claudin family and three junctional marvel domain proteins: occludin, tricellulin and MarvelD3 [17]. The junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) and zonula occludens (ZO) are also important proteins of tight junctions. Tight junction components are known to be targets for various pathogenic bacteria and viruses. They hijack the recycling process of tight junction proteins (internalization, hydrolysis, synthesis, and egression) to enter and infect cells or target junctional signaling mechanisms to open the intercellular space. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, claudin-1 was identified as a key factor and claudin-6 and claudin-9 as additional co-receptors [18, 19]. JAM-A with two extracellular V-type Ig domains serves as a receptor for feline calicivirus and all three serotypes of reovirus [20, 21]. Polarized epithelial cells are characterized by the presence of two distinct plasma membrane domains: the apical, corresponding to the luminal surface, and the basolateral, corresponding to the serosal surface [22, 23]. The two domains are separated by tight junctions which play an important role in maintaining the cell polarity and the unique protein-lipid composition of each domain. The best characterized experimental epithelial cell system for the study of polarized virus infection is that of the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell [24, 25] which provides a convenient model for the study of epithelial cell polarity. The entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), type C retrovirus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMC), Semlike Forest virus (SFV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and bovine herpesvirus-4 (BoHV-4) occurs at the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells [26\u201330], whereas simian virus 40 (SV40), respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) preferentially infect cells at the apical surface [31, 32].",

            "text": "Most studies of the rotavirus replication have been performed with MA104 cells, a poorly differentiated monkey kidney epithelial cell line. These cells do not exhibit the highly polarized and differentiated phenotype of enterocytes in vivo. The human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, established from a human colon adenocarcinoma, has been shown to spontaneously display the morphologic and biochemical properties of mature enterocytes [33]. Caco-2 cells are polarized with two plasma membrane domains: an apical one which faces the external lumen and a basolateral one which faces the internal milieu. Svensson et al. demonstrated that the MA104-cell adapted rhesus rotavirus (RRV) could infect both the apical and basolateral domains of Caco-2 cells in a symmetric manner, whereas the virions were secreted preferentially from the apical plasma membrane [34, 35]. In another study, Ciarlet et al. demonstrated that NA-sensitive strains infect efficiently only from the apical surface, NA-resistant strains infect equally well from the apical and basolateral surface [36]. Bugarcic and Taylor further demonstrated that the NSP4, a nonstructural glycoprotein encoded by rotavirus which induces diarrhea by acting as an enterotoxin, was actively secreted into the culture medium preferentially from the apical surface of infected Caco-2 cells [37]. Rotavirus mainly infects the mature villus enterocytes of jejunum and ileum in vivo. The importance of polarization and intercellular junctions have been less examined for porcine rotaviruses in their target cells [36, 38]. In this study, the co-culture system of porcine enterocytes that was established in our laboratory was used for this study [39].",

We observed that treatment with EGTA disrupted the intercellular junctions of enterocytes leading to a significantly drop of the TEER to baseline levels and significantly enhanced the infection of rotavirus in enterocytes. EGTA was found to mainly affect the binding of rotavirus to enterocytes. Upon different inoculation route, rotavirus mainly infected enterocytes at the basolateral surface. To our knowledge, this study is the first to disrupt intercellular bridges in a primary enterocyte culture system to explore the infection of rotavirus in polarized primary enterocytes.",

            "text": "The polarized epithelium of the gastrointestinal system displays the highest turnover of all solid organs, undergoing complete renewal every 2 to 3 days in pigs. It maintains a constant and effective barrier function to restrict the movement of solutes, ions, macromolecules and pathogens across the mucosa. This regulation can be attributed to the junctional complex between adjacent epithelial cells which is composed of the tight junction (TJ), adherens junction (AJ) and desmosomes. TJs are located at the apicolateral borders of adjacent epithelial cells, and form belt-like areas responsible for selectively regulating the passage of ions and neutral molecules through the paracellular space. One of the most important functions of TJs is to restrict pathogen access to the basaloteral side of the epithelium and the systemic blood circulation. Paradoxically, some viruses utilize TJ proteins as receptors. Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and adenovirus bind to the coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) which is expressed at the TJ and is associated with ZO-1 protein [43]. Reoviruses bind to the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) which is a TJ-localized integral membrane protein and JAM-A functions as coreceptor for rotavirus entry into MA104 cells [15, 20]. The TJ proteins occludin and claudin-1 facilitate the entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) [44, 45]. Calcium is the most important ion in regulating intercellular junction integrity. Low level of calcium disrupts AJ of epithelial cells, which is supposed to be caused by removing calcium from binding sites on E-cadherin extracellular domains, leading to a conformational change and disruption of cell\u2013cell adhesion [46, 47]. Depletion of extracellular calcium also mediates the redistribution of TJ proteins. Incubation of Caco-2 cells in calcium-free medium rapidly decreased transepithelial resistance and increased paracellular permeability, indicating a decreased tightness of TJ [48]. EGTA is a chelating agent which specifically sequestrates extracellular calcium. EGTA-induced depletion of calcium from the culture of polarized epithelial cells results in rapid splitting of ICJ. In our study, the primary enterocytes rapidly lost their ICJ after treatment with EGTA and became round, indicating that EGTA efficiently destroyed the ICJ of primary enterocytes. The disrupting effect of EGTA can be reversed by replenishing extracellular calcium [49]. In the present study, the enterocytes lost their contacts and became individual round cells after the EGTA treatment. The EGTA treated enterocytes reformed monolayers and maintained their viability after re-supplementation with calcium containing medium.",

            "text": "Destruction of the epithelial integrity by EGTA breaks down the barrier function of the epithelium against viruses. Van Cleemput et al. demonstrated that disruption of ICJ in equine respiratory mucosal explants and equine respiratory epithelial cells by EGTA significantly increased the infection of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV1) [29]. A similar effect of EGTA was found for bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) [30]. Treatment of bovine nasal mucosal and tracheal explants and bovine respiratory epithelial cells with EGTA enhanced BoHV-4 infection [30]. Rotavirus is one of the major enteric viruses that replicates in intestinal epithelial cells, which seriously causes blunting of intestinal villi and enterocyte vacuolization and lysis. We investigated the effect of disruption of ICJ of enterocytes in a monolayer on rotavirus infection. Treatment of cultured enterocytes with EGTA significantly increased the virus replication, which confirmed that the intercellular junctions protect intestinal epithelial cells to rotavirus infection and that depletion of intercellular junctions can significantly boost rotavirus replication in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that EGTA mainly affected the binding of rotavirus to enterocytes. This indicates that a main receptor is present in the intercellular region. Further work will focus on the identification of this receptor. Previous work in the rotavirus field demonstrated that sialidase-sensitive animal rotavirus strains can use terminal sialic acid as cellular receptor, whereas sialidase-insensitive human rotavirus strains bind to glycans with internal sialic acid, such as GM1 [50]. Recently, more and more data suggest that human rotavirus strains specifically recognize A-type histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) [12, 51]. The rotavirus strains used in this study are porcine rotaviruses with G5P[7] and G9P[23] genotypes [6]. According to the phylogenetic analyses done by Liu et al., P[7] and P[23] genotypes of porcine rotaviruses belong to the P[I] genogroup and should be considered to be sialidase-sensitive [51]. In our study, we demonstrated that by using MA104 cells, these rotavirus strains are sialidase-sensitive, because removal of the sialic acids of MA104 cells by treating the cells with neuraminidase significantly reduced viral replication. However, in primary porcine enterocytes, these low-passage P [7] and P[23] rotaviruses are sialidase-insensitive strains. The treatment of epithelial cells with neuraminidase did not affect viral replication, which indicated that these types of rotavirus strains do not bind terminal sialic acids on true target epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that for studying the receptors of rotaviruses, primary enterocytes should be used and not MA104 cells. We hypothesize that intercellular receptors of rotavirus are hidden by the intercellular junctions and that breaking down the intercellular junctions facilitates the exposure of this receptor and promotes rotavirus infection. Further investigations are needed to find out which proteins/glycans are these unknown receptors. The outer layer of the rotavirus contains calcium which stabilizes the trimeric VP7 [52]. During cell entry, the rotavirus triple layered particle uncoats, losing VP4 and VP7 [53]. In vitro, calcium chelation triggers uncoating of the triple layer particle. Loss of calcium causes VP7 to dissociate from the double layer particle and to release VP5* which is free to fold back to its most stable, post cleavage conformation to facilitate the membrane-disruptive step [54, 55]. Expressed VP7 protein undergoes an antigenic change upon calcium chelation, losing its ability to bind neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [52]. Abdelhakim et al. indicated that when the BSC-1 cells were pulsed with EDTA-containing medium, rotavirus does not internalize due to the loss of both VP7 and VP4, which significantly reduces rotavirus infection [56]. Similar results were observed with our primary enterocytes. We treated the cells with EGTA after binding of the rotavirus to investigate the effect of EGTA on the internalization stage of rotavirus. The results showed that calcium chelation at the internalization stage significantly blocked rotavirus infection. These findings indicate that rotavirus replication inside cells is mediated in a calcium-dependent manner.",

Therefore, we inoculated the primary enterocytes at either the apical or the basolateral surface. We found that both genotypes of rotavirus strains preferentially infected cells at the basolateral surface. Previous work that addressed the polarity of rotavirus infection in epithelial cells reported conflicting results. Svensson et al. found that the NA-sensitive rhesus rotavirus (RRV) infected Caco-2 cells in an asymmetric manner [35]. Ciarlet et al. demonstrated that NA-sensitive rotaviruses preferentially entered cells at the apical surface, while the NA-resistant rotaviruses entered cells at both the apical and basolateral surface [36]. Cevallos et al. reported that NA-sensitive rotaviruses infected IPEC-J2 cells more efficiently at the basolateral surface [38]. These conflicting results were conducted with different cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrated that rotavirus 12R050 and 12R046 are NA-sensitive for MA104 cell infections, while they are NA-resistant for enterocyte infections. Based on these results, we recommend investigating the polarity of rotavirus infections in the real target cell (primary enterocytes) and not in continuous cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that rotavirus mainly uses a basolateral receptor for infection of enterocytes. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use the primary enterocytes closely resembling the in vivo situation to demonstrate that porcine rotavirus strains are preferentially infecting via the basolateral domain of intestinal epithelial cells.
