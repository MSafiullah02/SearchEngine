As hospitals and providers pivot to respond, the pandemic spotlights leadership in healthcare. What is working as we all collectively combat this global viral scourge? The impetus to analyse leadership practices especially now comes from the adage that 'a crisis is a terrible thing to waste'. 1 The danger of COVID-19 is self-evident and is already all too apparent around the world. At this writing today (1 April 2020), 873 008 individuals have been infected worldwide and 43 275 have died. 2 In addition to the scientific opportunities to better understand the virus, its epidemiology, and strategies to prevent and cure COVID-19 disease, there is a clear opportunity to reflect on how to lead in healthcare through a crisis, to catalogue best practices, and to cascade these leadership practices broadly.",

The result is that as of 20 March 2020, roughly two-thirds of all the positive tests in the US state of Ohio were performed at my institution, where local testing capability was developed early. As another example, medical students, respiratory therapists, intensivists and biomedical engineering colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic are currently advancing designs for a rapid production ventilator in anticipation of a need for ventilators that will exceed supply should a surge occur. Also, in the spirit of 'little l' leadership that can be so impactful, medical students in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine have launched an online repository to identify volunteer activities to help busy interns, residents and fellows.

For example, in the coronavirus crisis, the primacy of supply chain and sourcing personal protective equipment from novel sources, like the paint and construction industries, has become evident as we plan for and ready ourselves for the surge of affected patients. Development of an 'incident command' centre which convenes key leaders regularly, makes real-time decisions based on harvesting the group's wisdom, and cascades Commentary awareness of these decisions broadly is a critical step. Communicating the structure and membership of this incident command team has been an institutional priority. The emphasis on how to organise the institutional response and how to cascade information bespeaks a commitment to 'inspiring a shared vision' and to 'enabling others to act'.

Wisdom from Voltaire that 'The perfect is the enemy of the good' and from Confucius that 'Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without' 4 is central to being able to act quickly. Leaders must (and, at the Cleveland Clinic) have amply acknowledged fallibility and the inevitability of making mistakes in our response to coronavirus. At the same time, these leaders have reaffirmed that any mistakes will be made in service of the organisation's mission-'better care of the sick, investigation of their problems, and more teaching of those who serve' and in the current coronavirus crisis, caring for our patients and protecting our fellow caregivers. Furthermore, creating psychological safety 5 is paramount in a crisis because the event calls on harvesting wisdom from every part of the organisation and, indeed, the world. Leaders' acknowledging their own fallibility in this effort helps create psychological safety, as does leaders' acknowledging others' efforts, even if incompletely successful. As has happened at my institution, when leaders acknowledge that in moving quickly, we will naturally make some mistakes, change course repeatedly and revise our thinking, they create space for colleagues to 'experiment, take risks, and learn from the accompanying mistakes'. 3 Again, this validates the centrality of having psychological safety and of 'challenging the process'. Also embedded in acting quickly is the leadership commitment of 'enabling others to act'.",

Indeed, communication since the very beginning of our planning (on 21 January 2020) has been an absolute priority in service of aligning caregivers and, through forthrightness and compulsive and thorough planning, assuaging anxiety by providing direction about how we will cope and prevail together. The primacy of acting in a synchronised, aligned fashion reflects the very origins of the Cleveland Clinic, which was forged in 1921 in the aftermath of World War I around the concept of 'acting as a unit'.

Leadership in a crisis requires both framing the challenge ahead while profusely acknowledging the contributions that have been made to date and optimistically capturing the reality that we will ultimately emerge from the crisis back to a state of normality. As an example, consider Winston Churchill's famous 'we shall fight on the beaches' speech to the British people in the throes of World War II and London bombings. Churchill amply acknowledged the formidable current challenge while articulating the resolve that ultimately allowed the UK and the allies to prevail. Churchill was truly 'encouraging the heart'. Leadership communications at the Cleveland Clinic are anchored in realism that coronavirus poses an existential challenge while coupled with optimism-exemplified by sharing specific stories-that our talent, commitment and organisational culture will assure ultimate success. Even when, as now, we are just approaching the eye of the storm, optimism and acknowledgement of colleagues' contributions to date galvanises people's commitment and provides stamina for the long haul.",

As they see clinician leaders on the front line of clinical care, their resolve to pitch in increases. This opportunity underscores a major advantage of a physician leadership model in which leaders engage in active clinical practice, perhaps especially in times of pressing need as now. 8 Overall, a crisis heightens the need for great leadership and underscores needed leadership competencies, both through success in their presence and through failure in their absence. Along with specific leadership practices that may hold value to others as they navigate the current coronavirus pandemic or the next challenge, this reflection invokes the five leadership competencies articulated by Kouzes and Posner 3 as well as the primacy of creating psychological safety. 5 Contributors This is an original commentary of which JKS is the sole author.
