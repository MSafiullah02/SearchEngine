            "text": "In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kathryn Stephenson and colleagues 5 report the final results of a phase 1 clinical trial on the safety and immunogenicity of a Zika purified inactivated virus vaccine given via standard, accelerated, or shortened schedules. The authors showed that their Zika vaccine formulation was well tolerated, immunogenic, and did not show signs of inducing any significant adverse medical outcome (eg, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) through 52 weeks of follow-up. A two-dose prime-boost regimen of the vaccine, administered either via a standard schedule (weeks 0 and 4) or an accelerated schedule (weeks 0 and 2), elicited a robust Zika virus neutralising antibody response that peaked 2 weeks after the final vaccination, and then declined to a geometric mean titre of less than 100 by study week 16. The sharp decay in Zika virus neutralising antibody titres might be linked to poor induction of cellular immune responses by the inactivated vaccine. 6 This antigen formulation is still far from an ideal vaccine, and efforts to develop or refine promising Zika vaccine candidates must remain a priority. However, because of the progresses made we might be somewhat better prepared should a new Zika outbreak occur.",

Nevertheless, safety issues still need to be addressed.",

Moreover, it is still uncertain whether low levels of anti-Zika antibody can affect the clinical outcome of dengue infection. Antidengue antibodies have been shown to enhance Zika virus infection in in-vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models, but the role of anti-Zika antibodies in dengue infections remains unclear. 9 In an ex-vivo human skin model, low titres of anti-Zika antibodies enhanced dengue infection of macrophages and dendritic cells, suggesting that a vaccine formulation that induces low immunogenicity might increase the risk for severe dengue. 10 This potential risk could probably be mitigated by administering Zika vaccine to individuals who have already been exposed to dengue.",
