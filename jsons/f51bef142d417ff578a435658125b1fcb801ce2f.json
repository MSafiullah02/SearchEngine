A chloroquine dose of 600 mg base (=1000 mg salt) should be given initially, followed by 300 mg base (=500 mg salt) at 6, 24, and 48 h after the initial dose for a total chloroquine dose of 1500 mg base (=2500 mg salt). -For chloroquine-resistant strains, treatment options are as follows:Artemisinin derivatives clear parasites very rapidly, are now a key component of malaria treatment worldwide, and have been shown to reduce mortality in severe malaria compared with parenteral quinine. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, including artesunate-mefloquine, artemetherlumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, are highly efficacious. Under the CDC protocol, intravenous artesunate is administered in four equal doses of 2.4 mg/kg of body weight over a period of 3 days. The dosing schedule recommended by the WHO entails doses every 12 h on day 1 and then once daily. Up to 7 days of therapy may occasionally be indicated in very ill patients. \u2022 Quinine sulfate: Quinine has a rapid onset of action and, in combination with tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin, has been shown to be a very efficacious treatment option for P. falciparum infections acquired in regions with chloroquine-resistant strains.Focal signs / Features of raised ICP ABG, CBC, Electrolytes, RFT, LFT, EEG Presumptive therapy (Inj.
