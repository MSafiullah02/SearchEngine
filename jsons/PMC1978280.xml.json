This included the development of methods and databases, quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs), similarity searching, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modelling, machine learning, data mining, network analysis and data analysis tools that all use a computer. We have also previously introduced how some of these methods can be used for virtual ligand- and target-based screening and virtual affinity profiling. In this second part of the review, we will greatly expand on the applications of these methods to many different target proteins and complex properties, and discuss the pharmacological space covered by some of these in silico efforts. In the process, we will detail the success of in silico methods at identifying new pharmacologically active molecules for many targets and highlight the resulting enrichment factors when screening active drug-like databases. We will finally discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research.",

The recent crystal structure of a mammalian de-ubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP, which specifically de-ubiquitinates the ubiquitinated p53 protein, may also assist in drug development despite the peptidic nature of its substrate (Hu et al., 2002). Novel non-peptidic inhibitors of the protease ubiquitin isopeptidase, which not only de-ubiquitinates p53 but other general ubiquitinated proteins as well, were discovered recently using a simple pharmacophore-based search of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database (Mullally et al., 2001; Mullally and Fitzpatrick, 2002). These inhibitors had IC50 values in the low micromolar range and caused cell death independent of the tumour suppressor p53, which is mutated in greater than 50% of all cancers (hence, p53 inhibition per se may not represent an optimal target for modulation). The ubiquitin isopeptidase inhibitors shikoccin, dibenzylideneacetone, curcumin and the more recently described punaglandins from coral indicate that a sterically accessible \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone is essential for bioactivity (Verbitski et al., 2004). All these molecules represent valuable leads for further chemical optimization.",

A Catalyst qualitative HipHop model was created with 16 different molecules that resulted in a five-feature pharmacophore. A homology model of the enzyme was based on two soybean LOX enzymes and one rabbit LOX enzyme. Molecular docking was then used to update and refine the pharmacophore to a four-feature model that could also be visualized in the homology model of 5-LOX. As a result of these models, amino-acid residues in the binding site were suggested as targets for site-directed mutagenesis while virtual screening with the pharmacophore had suggested compounds with a phenylthiourea or pyrimidine-5-carboxylate group for testing (Charlier et al., 2006). Homology models for the human 12-LOX and 15-LOX have also been used with the flexible ligand docking programme Glide (Schr\u00f6dinger Inc.) to perform virtual screening of 50 000 compounds.

            "text": "More than 30 years of research on renin have not been enough to deliver a marketed drug that inhibits this enzyme. In spite of this, renin remains an attractive yet elusive target for hypertension (Fisher and Hollenberg, 2001; Stanton, 2003). In this respect, application of structure-based design leads to the identification of new non-peptidic inhibitors of human renin. These molecules include aliskiren (Rahuel et al., 2000; Torres et al., 2003), piperidines, including Ro-0661168 (Guller et al., 1999; Oefner et al., 1999; Vieira et al., 1999), and related 3,4-disubstituted piperidines (Marki et al., 2001). Interestingly, these piperidines bind to and stabilize a different conformer of the protein termed \u2018open renin' (Bursavich and Rich, 2002), whereas aliskiren binds to \u2018closed renin'. Since these latter structure-based design efforts, there have been remarkably very few published attempts at computer-aided design of novel renin inhibitors. A single early QSAR was derived for a series of chain-modified peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. The activity of these molecules was found to correlate with Kier's first-order molecular connectivity index descriptor and molecular weight but not with lipophilicity as measured by logP (Khadikar et al., 2005). Another computational method for renin drug discovery used the de novo design software GrowMol, which could apparently regenerate 3,4-disubstituted piperidines in 1% of the grown structures (Bursavich and Rich, 2002). An attempt to use a Catalyst pharmacophore to discover new renin inhibitors was described in the early 1990s (Van Drie, 1993). Several novel molecules from the Pomona database (an early three-dimensional (3D) molecule database) were found that mapped to a renin pharmacophore but apparently were not tested in vitro. More recently, a LigandFit docking study with a crystal structure of the \u2018open renin' form was able to detect 10 known inhibitors seeded in a library of 1000 compounds within the top 8.4% when using a consensus scoring function. Four examples of high-scoring compounds that were not tested as inhibitors fulfilled the pharmacophore derived from the X-ray data, consisting of four hydrophobes, a hydrogen bond donor or positive ionizable feature as well as excluded volumes (Krovat and Langer, 2004). Another study has used similarity searching of the MDDR database (for over 100 000 compounds) using 10 renin inhibitors and was able to produce enrichment factors that were 17-fold greater than random (Hert et al., 2004). Genetic algorithms have also been used for class discrimination between renin inhibitors and non-inhibitors in a subset of the MDDR using a small number of interpretable descriptors. Among them, amide bond count, molecular weight and hydrogen bond donor counts were found to be much higher in renin inhibitors (Ganguly et al., 2006). The recent publications on novel renin inhibitors represent a considerable amount of new information that could be used for further QSAR model development and database searching efforts in order to derive novel starting scaffolds for optimization.",

            "text": "Cathepsin D is an aspartic protease found mainly in lysosomes, which may have a role in \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein release and hence may well be a target for Alzheimer's disease. Cathepsin D may also be elevated in breast cancer and ovarian cancer hence a means to modulate this activity could be beneficial in these diseases. There has been a brief overview of Cathepsin D in a comprehensive review of protease inhibitors (Leung et al., 2000). A combination of a structure-based design algorithm and combinatorial chemistry has been successfully applied to finding novel molecules for Cathepsin D in the nanomolar range (Kick et al., 1997). Structures based on pepstatin (a 3.8 pM inhibitor (Baldwin et al., 1993)) yielded a 6\u20137% hit rate. These molecules were tested in vitro using hippocampal slices and were shown to block the formation of hyperphosphorylated Tau fragments (Bi et al., 2000). There have been relatively few computational studies to date on Cathepsin D and other related aspartic proteases such as renin and \u03b2-secretase. One study has used molecular dynamics and free energy analyses (MM-PBSA) of Cathepsin D inhibitor interactions to suggest new substitutions that may improve binding (Huo et al., 2002). A genetic algorithm-based de novo design tool, ADAPT has also been used to rediscover active Cathepsin D molecules, by placing key fragments in the correct positions (Pegg et al., 2001). Computational models may aid in the selection of novel ligands for protease inhibition that are non-peptidic and selective. Using the structural features of eight published inhibitors for Cathepsin D (Huo et al., 2002), a five-feature pharmacophore was derived consisting of three hydrophobes and two hydrogen bond acceptors (r=0.98). This pharmacophore was used to search a molecule database and selected 10 molecules out of 11 441 present. In contrast, a similarity search at the 95% level using ChemFinder (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA, USA) suggested 16 different molecules. All of these were selected for testing in vitro. The pharmacophore produced four hits (40% hit rate) and the similarity search generated five hits (31% hit rate), where at least one replicate showed greater than 40% inhibition (Ekins et al., 2004a). In silico evaluation of the ADME properties for all active compounds estimated that the molecules would be well absorbed, although some were predicted to have solubility and CYP2D6 inhibition problems.",

An X-ray structure for one molecule was used to confirm the predicted binding conformation. Ultimately, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model was generated with all molecules synthesized and was found to be complementary to the X-ray structure. The outcome of this study was a molecule with good cellular activity that could inhibit blood glucose levels in vivo in rat (Klabunde et al., 2005).",

Kinase space has been mapped using selectivity data for small molecules to create a chemogenomic dendrogram for 43 kinases that showed the highly homologous kinases to be inhibited similarly by small molecules (Vieth et al., 2004). Virtual screening methods have been applied quite widely for kinases to date (Fischer, 2004). The structure-based design method has produced new potent inhibitors of CDK1 starting from the highly similar apo CDK2 and the positioning of olomoucine. A few amino-acid residues were mutated to conform to the CDK1 sequence. MacroModel was used to energy minimize molecules in the ATP pocket and visual inspection suggested points for molecular modification on the ligand. Very quickly, design efforts guided ligand optimization to improve activity from 4.5 \u03bcM to 25 nM (Furet et al., 2000). A more recent CDK1/cyclin B homology model was also used to manually dock ligands, which enabled progression from alsterpaullone with an IC50 of 35 nM to a derivative with an IC50 of 0.23 nM (Kunick et al., 2005).",

(1968) using small sets of similar molecules and a few molecular descriptors. Later, Lewis and co-workers provided many QSAR and homology models for the individual human CYPs (Lewis, 2000). As more sophisticated computational modelling tools became available, we have seen a growth in the number of available models (de Groot and Ekins, 2002b; de Graaf et al., 2005; de Groot, 2006) and the size of the data sets they encompass. Some more recent methods are also incorporating water molecules into the binding sites when docking molecules into these enzymes and these may be important as hydrogen bond mediators with the binding site amino acids (Lill et al., 2006). Docking methods can also be useful for suggesting novel metabolites for drugs. A recent example used a homology model of CYP2D6 and docked metoclopramide as well as 19 other drugs to show a good correlation between IC50 and docking score r2=0.61 (Yu et al., 2006). A novel aromatic N-hydroxy metabolite was suggested as the major metabolite and confirmed in vitro. Now that several crystal structures of the mammalian CYPs are available, they have been found to compare quite favourably to the prior computational models (Rowland et al., 2006). However, for some enzymes like CYP3A4, where there is both ligand and protein promiscuity, there may be difficulty in making reliable predictions with some computational approaches such as docking with the available crystal structures (Ekroos and Sjogren, 2006). Hence, multiple pharmacophores or models may be necessary for this and other enzymes (Ekins et al., 1999a, 1999b), as it has been indicated by others more recently (Mao et al., 2006).",

The pharmacophores for the human UGT1A1, UGT1A4 and UGT1A9 all have in common two hydrophobes and a glucuronidation feature, while UGT1A9 has an additional hydrogen bond acceptor feature (Smith et al., 2004; Sorich et al., 2004).

To the best of our knowledge, computational models for other isozymes have not been developed. In general, conjugating enzymes have generally been infrequently targeted for in silico models.

A traditional QSAR study used a small number of tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline derivatives as antagonists of the rat 5-HT2B contractile receptor in the rat stomach fundus (Singh and Kumar, 2001). A 3D-QSAR with GRID-GOLPE using 38 (aminoalkyl)benzo and heterocycloalkanones as antagonists of the human receptor resulted in very poor model statistics, possibly owing to the limited range of activity measured and the fact that the data corresponded to a functional response that is likely more complex (Brea et al., 2002). Neither of these models was validated with external predictions. On the basis of bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin, homology models for the mouse and human 5-HT2B receptor have been combined with site-directed mutagenesis. The bacteriorhodopsin structure provided more reliable models, which confirmed an aromatic box hypothesis for ligand interaction along transmembrane domains 3, 6, 7 with serotonin (Manivet et al., 2002). A more recent 5-HT2B homology model based on the rhodopsin-based model of the rat 5-HT2A was used to determine the sites of interaction for norfenfluramine following molecular dynamics simulations. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Val 2.53 was implicated in high-affinity binding through van der Waals interactions and the ligand methyl groups (Setola et al., 2005). There is certainly an opportunity to develop further QSAR models for this receptor in order to rapidly screen libraries of molecules to identify undesirable potent inhibitors.",

For example, a conformational study of four ligands defined a pharmacophore of the antagonist site using SYBYL (Hibert et al., 1988). The model resulting from such an active analogue approach was used in molecule design and predicted molecule stereospecificity. More recently, a series of over 700 homology models were iteratively created based on the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin that were in turn tuned by FlexX docking of known ligands. The final model was used in a virtual screening simulation that was enriched with inhibitors, compared with random selection and from this the authors suggested its utility for a real virtual screen (Nowak et al., 2006). A homology model of the 5-HT1A receptor has also been used with DOCK to screen a library of 10 000 compounds seeded with 34 5-HT1A ligands. Ninety percent of these active compounds were ranked in the top 1000 compounds (Becker et al., 2006), representing a significant enrichment. The same model was used to screen a library of 40 000 vendor compounds and select 78 for testing, of which 16 had activities below 5 \u03bcM, one possessing 1 nM affinity. Structure-based in silico optimization was then performed to improve selectivity with other GPCRs and optimize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. However, as this proceeded, the molecules were found to have affinity for the human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG), and this was subsequently computationally assessed using a homology model that pointed to adjusting the hydrophobicity. The resulting clinical candidate had good target and antitarget selectivity and backup compounds were selected in the same way (Becker et al., 2006).",

Using the available structure of the oestrogen receptor subtype \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) in its antagonist conformation, a homology model of the retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) was constructed (Schapira et al., 2000). Using this homology model, virtual screening of a compound library lead to the identification of two novel RAR\u03b1 antagonists in the micromolar range. The same approach was later applied to discover 14 novel and diverse micromolar antagonists of the thyroid hormone receptor (Schapira et al., 2000). By means of a procedure designed particularly to select compounds fitting onto the LxxLL peptide-binding surface of the oestrogen receptor, novel ER\u03b1 antagonists were identified (Shao et al., 2004). Since poor displacement of 17\u03b2-estradiol was observed in the ER-ligand competition assay, these compounds may represent new classes of ER\u03b1 antagonists, with the potential to provide an alternative to current anti-oestrogen therapies. The discovery of three low micromolar hits for ER\u03b2 displaying over 100-fold binding selectivity with respect to ER\u03b1 was also recently reported using database screening (Zhao and Brinton, 2005). A final example reports the identification and optimization of a novel family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-\u03b3 partial agonists based upon pyrazol-4-ylbenzenesulfonamide after employing structure-based virtual screening, with good selectivity profile against the other subtypes of the same nuclear receptor group (Lu et al., 2006).",

This value will depend on the properties of the compound in question and will be influenced by the steric properties of the active site as well as the ease of expulsion of the leaving group from the active site. Balakin et al. (2004), have recently used neural network methods to model the Vmax data for N-dealkylation mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, using whole molecules, centroid of the reaction and leaving group-related descriptors. These models were also used to predict small sets of molecules not included in training. Ultimately, many other reactions and the evaluation of other enzymes will be necessary. Similarly, larger test sets are required for all the above complex property models to provide further confidence in the models in terms of their utility and applicability.",

This demonstrates some of the key roles of the computational technologies that can assist pharmacology. These roles include finding new antagonists or agonists for a target using an array of methods either in the absence or presence of a structure for the target. Computational methods may also aid in understanding the underlying biology using network/pathways based on annotated data (signalling cascades), determining the connectivity of drug as a network with targets to understand selectivity, integration with other models for PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) and ultimately the emergence of systems in silico pharmacology. Obviously, we have taken more of a pharmaceutical bias in this review but we would argue these methods are equally amenable and should be considered to discover new chemical probes for the academic pharmacologist as opposed to lead molecules for optimization to become drugs. Some of the advantages of in silico pharmacology and in silico methods in general are the reduction in the number of molecules made and tested through database searching to find inhibitors or substrates, increased speed of experiments through reliable prediction of most pharmaceutical properties from molecule structure alone and ultimately reductions in animal and reagent use. We must however consider the multiple optimization of numerous predicted properties, possibly either weighting in silico pharmacology models by importance (or confidence in the model and or data), as well as data set size and diversity. Similarly, we should consider the disadvantages of in silico pharmacology methods as protein flexibility, molecule conformation and promiscuity all hinder accurate predictions. For example, even with the recent availability of crystal structures for several mammalian drug-metabolizing enzymes, there is still considerable difficulty in reliable metabolism predictions. Our focus thus far has been on the creation of many in silico pharmacology models for human properties, yet as pharmacology uses animals for much in vivo testing and subcellular preparations from several species for in vitro experiments, we need models from other species both to understand differences as well as enable better scaling between them. A widely discussed disadvantage of in silico methods is the applicability of the model, which will now be discussed further.",

For example, models may be generated with a narrow homologous series of pharmacologically relevant molecules (local model) or a structurally diverse range of molecules (global model). These two approaches have their pros and cons, respectively. The applicability domain of the local model may be much narrower than for the global model such that changing to a new chemical series will result in prediction failure. However, global models may also fail if the predicted molecule falls far enough away from representative molecules in the training set. These limitations are particularly specific to QSAR models. From many of the in silico pharmacology model examples described above, the QSAR models are generally local in nature and this will limit lead hopping to new structural series, whereas global models may be more useful for this feature. Several papers have described the applicability domain of models and methods in considerable detail (Dimitrov et al., 2005; Tetko et al., 2006) to calculate this property. Molecular similarity to training set compounds may be a reliable measure for prediction quality (Sheridan et al., 2004) as demonstrated for a hERG model (Ekins et al., 2006). To our knowledge, there has not been a specific analysis of the applicability domain specifically for in silico pharmacology models (other than for those examples described above) to the same degree as there has been for physicochemical properties like solubility and logP. The applicability domain of pharmacophore models have not been addressed either as the focus has primarily been on statistical QSAR methods.",

There have been numerous occasions in the study of drug-metabolizing enzymes were QSAR and homology models have been combined or used to validate each other (de Groot et al., 2002a; de Graaf et al., 2005; de Groot, 2006).",

The production of regioselective metabolites (for example, hydroxylation to a phenol and an alcohol) is usually predictable from such methods, but that of different routes (for example, oxidation versus glucuronidation) is not.

This is an interesting observation as for many years computational studies were generally performed after synthesis of molecules, and essentially provided illustrative pictures and explanation of the data. Now it appears we are seeing a shift in the other direction as predictions are published for pharmacological activity without apparently requiring in vitro or in vivo experimental verification, as long as the models themselves are validated in some manner. As the models may only have a limited prediction domain so perhaps in future we will see some discussion of the predicted molecules and their distance from the training set or some other measure of how far the predictions can be extended.",

Many of the examples we have presented have demonstrated significant enrichments over random selection of molecules and so far these have been the most plentiful types of metrics that are routinely used to validate in silico models. The future of in silico pharmacology may be somewhat difficult to predict. While we are seeing a closer interaction between computational and in vitro approaches to date, will we see a similar relationship with in vivo studies in the future? More broadly, will in silico pharmacology ever be able to replace entirely experimental approaches in vitro and even in vivo, as some animal rights activists want us to believe? The answer here can only be a clear and resounding \u2018no' (at least in the near future), for two irrefutable reasons. First, biological entities are nonlinear systems showing \u2018chaotic behaviour'. As such, there is no relation between the magnitude of the input and the magnitude of the output, with even the most minuscule differences between initial conditions rapidly translating into major differences in the output. And second, no computer programme, however \u2018complex and systems-like', will ever be able to fully model the complexity of biological systems. Indeed, and in the formulation of the mathematician Gregory Chaitin, biological systems are algorithmically incompressible, meaning that they cannot be modelled fully by an algorithm shorter than themselves.",
