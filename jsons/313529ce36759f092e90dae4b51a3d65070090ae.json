            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged for the first time in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is a type of highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV) that causes zoonotic diseases and poses a major threat to public health. The vast majority of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) have had a good prognosis, but there were still some critical individuals and even deaths. 1 Most of these critically ill and dead patients did not develop severe clinical manifestations in the early stages of the disease. Some of the patients only showed mild fever, cough, or muscle soreness. The conditions of these patients deteriorated suddenly in the later stages of the disease or in the process of recovery. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure occurred rapidly, resulting in death within a short time. 2 Cytokine storm is considered to be one of the major causes of ARDS and multipleorgan failure. 3 It plays an important role in the process of disease aggravation. 4 Clinical studies have detected a cytokine storm in critical patients with COVID-19. Therefore, effectively suppressing the cytokine storm is an important way to prevent the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 infection and save the patients' lives. 5 This article reviews the mechanisms by which HCoV infection induces cytokine storm and the options to inhibit the cytokine storm, in order to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",

According to their pathogenicity, HCoVs are divided into mildly pathogenic HCoVs (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU) and highly pathogenic CoVs (including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), 9 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 10 , 11 and SARS-CoV-2). The mildly pathogenic HCoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause seasonal, mild to moderate cold-like respiratory diseases in healthy individuals. In contrast, the highly pathogenic HCoVs (hereinafter referred to as pathogenic HCoVs or HCoVs) infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia, sometimes leading to fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. The pathogenic HCoVs have high morbidity and mortality and pose a major threat to public health. [12] [13] [14] ",

A rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection. However, dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immune damage to the human body. [15] [16] [17] The relevant evidences from severely ill patients with HCoVs suggest that proinflammatory responses play a role in the pathogenesis of HCoVs. In vitro cell experiments show that delayed release of cytokines and chemokines occurs in respiratory epithelial cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages at the early stage of SARS-CoV infection. Later, the cells secrete low levels of the antiviral factors interferons (IFNs) and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1 \u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) and chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5). [18] [19] [20] Like SARS, MERS-CoV infects human airway epithelial cells, THP-1 cells (a monocyte cell line), human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs, and induces delayed but elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 21 , 22 After MERS-CoV infection, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but not mononuclear macrophages and DCs, 23 are induced to produce a large amount of IFNs.",

            "text": "Animal models can well elucidate the role of cytokines and chemokines in mediating pulmonary immunopathology after HCoV infection. Despite of similar virus titers in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-infected old nonhuman primates are more likely to develop immune dysregulation than the infected young primates, leading to more severe disease manifestations. 37 It seems that the excessive inflammatory response rather than the virus titer is more relevant to the death of the old nonhuman primates. 37 Similarly, in BALB/c mice infected with SARS-CoV, disease severity in old mice is related to the early and disproportionately strong upregulation of the ARDS-related inflammatory gene signals. 38 The rapid replication of SARS-CoV in BALB/c mice induces the delayed release of IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2, which is accompanied by the influx of many pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages. 15 The accumulated mononuclear macrophages receive activating signals through the IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2 receptors on their surface and produce more monocyte chemoattractants (such as CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12), resulting in the further accumulation of mononuclear macrophages. These mononuclear macrophages produce elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL1-\u03b2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase), thereby increasing the severity of the disease. Depleting inflammatory monocyte-macrophages or neutralizing the inflammatory cytokine TNF protected mice from the fatal SARS-CoV infection. In addition, IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2 or mononuclear macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines induce the apoptosis of T cells, which further hinders viral clearance. 15 Another consequence of rapid viral replication and vigorous proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine response is the induction of apoptosis in lung epithelial and endothelial cells. IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induce inflammatory cell infiltration through mechanisms involving Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) or TRAIL-death receptor 5 (DR5) and cause the apoptosis of airway and alveolar epithelial cells. [39] [40] [41] Apoptosis of endothelial cells and epithelial cells damages the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and causes vascular leakage and alveolar edema, eventually leading to hypoxia in the body. Therefore, inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS.",

[55] [56] [57] [58] IFN-\u03bb IFN-\u03bb primarily activates epithelial cells and reduces the mononuclear macrophage-mediated proinflammatory activity of IFN-\u03b1\u03b2. 59 In addition, IFN-\u03bb inhibits the recruitment of neutrophils to the sites of inflammation. 60 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV mainly infect alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). IFN-\u03bb activates the antiviral genes in epithelial cells, thereby exerting antiviral effects without overstimulating the human immune system. Therefore, IFN-\u03bb may be an ideal treatment. Some studies have applied pegylated and non-pegylated interferons for the treatment of HCoVs, but the efficacy varied significantly due to the application of different treatment regimens. Early administration of interferons has certain benefits in reducing viral load and improves the clinical symptoms of patients to a certain extent. However, it fails to reduce mortality rates.

            "text": "Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that have antiinflammatory functions. Corticosteroids are commonly used to suppress inflammation. During the 2003 SARS epidemic, corticosteroids were the primary means of immunomodulation. Timely administration of corticosteroids often leads to early improvements such as reducing fever, relieving radiation infiltration of the lung, and improving oxygenation. [64] [65] [66] A retrospective study of 401 patients with severe SARS revealed that proper administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe SARS significantly reduced the mortality rate and shortened the hospital stay. Moreover, secondary infections and other complications rarely occurred in these glucocorticoid-treated patients. 67 However, there are studies showing that administration of corticosteroid therapy during human SARS-CoV infection led to adverse consequences. Early treatment of SARS patients with corticosteroids increased plasma viral load in non-ICU patients, resulting in the aggravation of the disease. 64 In treatment of patients with COVID-19, the use of glucocorticoids has again become a major conundrum for clinicians. 68 The timing of administration and the dosage of glucocorticoids are very important to the outcome of the severely ill patients. A too early administration of glucocorticoids inhibits the initiation of the body's immune defense mechanism, thereby increasing the viral load and ultimately leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm. Inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ARDS and protects the functions of the patients' organs. For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid imaging progress, and excessive inflammatory response, the use of glucocorticoid in the short term (3-5 days) is appropriate, and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day. 69 It should be noted that large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus due to immunosuppression.",
