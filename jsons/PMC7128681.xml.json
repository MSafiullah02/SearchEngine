In addition to pre-existing travel health information for travel to China, TravelHealthPro has produced news items to help travellers keep pace with the evolving nature of this outbreak; particularly important when this outbreak has coincided with the national holiday of Chinese New Year, when large numbers of UK travellers will have planned to visit China. Outbreak information is updated daily so that data on cases to other countries can also be tracked. These resources appear to be reaching a large audience \u2013 with pageviews to the TravelHealthPro website hitting a new record of 80,000 in one day, and pageviews of the China-specific advice page increasing by over 400% - from 9000 views in January 2019, to over 45,000 in January 2020 [unpublished data]. Anecdotally calls to the advice line regarding the outbreak have also increased and this trend is likely to continue as 2019-nCoV cases increase in travel destinations out with China. These early signals of high public concern can help frontline clinical staff in their preparations for potentially similar increases in consultations, and the resources and capacity building this may require.",

The clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated [40]. Cases in Vietnam, Thailand and United States [22,44], have been reported where patients received antivirals, such as remdesivir [44], among other drugs including oseltamivir; clinical trials of antivirals and vaccines are ongoing for MERS-CoV and one controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy for 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029308) [45], at the Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital [46] is in progress. In a historical control study [14,47], the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Saudi Arabia initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection [14,48,49]. In the first case of 2019-nCoV in the USA, the administration of remdesivir was considered for compassionate use based on the case patient's worsening clinical status. Certainly, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and any other investigational agents for treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection [44].",
