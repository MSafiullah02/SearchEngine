            "text": "\nAntigen-Based Identification uses rapid assessment for the presence of microbial antigens and provides a \u201cpoint of care\u201d solution for diseases for which immediate answers impact patient care decisions. The principle of all of these assays is that a microbial antigen is present at sufficient quantity for which an antibody has been generated for detection. Common platform types include lateral flow assays (antibodies bound to a matrix through which the patient sample containing antigen passes and results in a colorimetric readout; examples are BinaxNow for Malaria, Remel Xpect for Clostridium difficile assays, p24 antigen detection in human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and fluorescent immunoassays (similar to lateral flow concept but with automated detection and fluorescently labeled antibodies; examples are Sofia system for bacteria and viruses).1, 2 These assays may be available commercially to consumers or used in microbiology laboratories as inexpensive tools to screen for common diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza, Streptococcal antigens, diarrhea in acutely ill patients). In many laboratories, these rapid tests are confirmed by a second test which may include additional protein testing or nucleic acid testing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in anatomic pathology is based on the same principle as these rapid tests and has a wide range of uses for the detection and sometimes speciation of organisms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) sections. Organisms commonly identified this way include spirochetes, mycobacteria, DNA viruses, Aspergillus, Candida, and Toxoplasma, although special reference laboratories (e.g., The Infectious Disease Pathology Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) have a wide range of antibodies for common to exotic pathogens for tissue confirmation.",

After a microbial colony forms, it can be spotted onto a MALDI plate in matrix compound and loaded onto the mass spectrophotometer. This topic has been reviewed in great detail.3, 4, 5 Briefly, a laser is focused onto the sample/matrix spot, causing sublimation, ionization, migration through a time of flight tube, and detection by a mass spectrometer (MS).The readout is a spectrum of peaks representing mass to charge ratios (M/Z) of different analytes. The mass range (approximately 2 to 20 kDa) is highly enriched for ribosomal proteins, which make up a large share of the typical MALDI spectra on clinical instruments. Spectra are compared with curated databases and the result is returned along with a metric describing the strength of the identification.",

            "text": "This technology has been widely adopted in Europe and is gradually entering clinical microbiology labs in the United States. There are currently two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved systems: the Vitek MS (BioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, North Carolina) and the MALDI Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, Massachusetts). Although the technology behind these two systems is essentially equivalent, they differ in their curated libraries, software, identification algorithms, and scoring systems.5 For example, the Vitek MS reports isolates with a confidence value of 1% to 100%, whereas the Biotyper returns a score that can range from 0 to 3.000. For most applications a score of 2.000 or greater is necessary for a species level identification. Because of this, it can be difficult to directly compare results between the two systems. There have been several studies using both platforms back to back. One study on a large collection of 642 strains of bacteria, yeasts, and molds demonstrated comparable performance, although noting that the library coverage of the test cohort was greater with the Biotyper (572 strains) than the Vitek MS (406) and that the Vitek was more likely to output a misidentification for strains not represented in the library.6\n",

In general, performance has been reported to equal or exceed traditional biochemical systems, although it seems to be stronger for gram-negative than gram-positive organisms.5, 7 Lackluster performance, in particular, has been noted for several gram-positive rods. In a study with the Biotyper, the system was unable to identify several isolates of Nocardia, Tsukamurella, Kocuria, or Gordonia, although 89.7% of Listeria and 80% of Rhodococcus were correctly classified.\n8 Members of Corynebacteria, Lactobacillus, and some Listeria also seem to present some difficulty, both in terms of difficulty discriminating between species and in requiring a lowered score cutoff (1.7) for species-level identification.9 In similar studies using the Vitek platform, there were also reported problems in speciation of Listeria.10 The misidentification of a Kocuria as a Corynebacterium has also been reported.11 Among both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, MALDI-TOF has several well-characterized difficulties discriminating certain species and complexes, including Streptococcus pneumoniae/Streptococcus mitis, Escherichia coli/Shigella, and members of the Enterobacter cloacae complex.3 Finally, it is important to note that the Biotyper requires a Security-Relevant Library for the identification of such organisms as Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Brucella spp.12\n",

The system also showed lower performance for certain species of Bacteroides, Actinomyces, and Prevotella. Similarly, in a study using the Biotyper platform to identify 197 anaerobes isolated from blood cultures, 86.8% of the strains were correctly identified to the species level (using a score of 2) and 94.9% to the genus level.15\nFusobacterium spp. was again problematic, with only 23% being correctly identified to the species level. With formic acid/ethanol pretreatment, this number increased to 76.9%. In addition, 20.8% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. was misidentified as other Bacteroides, with high confidence scores, and only 52.9% of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci were correctly identified to the species level. The latter was mostly a function of poor performance on several species of Peptoniphilus.15 Interestingly, in a dedicated study looking at the performance of the Biotyper (2.0) on a collection of 277 isolates of Bacteroides spp., 97.5% were correctly identified to the species level.16\n",

Both systems have demonstrated strong performance in multiple studies, reviewed by Cassagne et al.17 One recent study with the Biotyper, for example, used a library of 303 clinical isolates representing a diverse array of yeasts and found an agreement with standard methods in 84.8%.18 In an additional 26 isolates the Biotyper returned a result that was confirmed as true by sequencing in 21. The Biotyper failed to make identification in an additional 20 isolates. Bader et al. used an even larger cohort of clinical yeast isolates (1192) to compare the performance of traditional methods with the Bruker Biotyper and the Vitek SARAMIS (research use only database). They found an overall agreement between the methods of 95.1% and noted not only that both MALDI methods were able to discriminate species that traditional methods could not, but that the savings in time and money were substantial.19 More recently, Chao et al. analyzed a collection of 200 clinical yeast isolates with both the Biotyper and the Vitek MS.20 They found that the Biotyper slightly out-performed the Vitek MS (92.5% vs 79.5% correctly identified to the species or complex level). This compared with rates of 89% and 74% for two common phenotypic methods (Phoenix 100 YBC and the Vitek 2 Yeast ID, respectively). This trend was also observed by Mancini et al., who used a collection of 197 clinical yeast isolates, which included 157 Candida or related species and 40 non-Candida species. They found that the Biotyper identified 89.8% of isolates, whereas the Vitek MS identified 84.3% using the standard commercially available database. Importantly, the Vitek MS had a much higher rate of misidentification (12.1% vs 1%).21 In general, it has been found that a formic acid/ethanol extraction method and lowered identity cutoffs (i.e., 1.7 on the Biotyper) are optimal for the analysis of yeasts.22\n",

Concerns with this group include not only efficient cell lysis but also the need for higher-quality reference databases.17 Few studies have assessed the Biotyper or Vitek MS platforms on fungal isolates using only the commercially available databases. Iriart et al. analyzed a group of 236 clinical isolates with the Vitek MS (192 yeast and 44 Aspergillus) and found that 93.2% of the isolates were correctly identified, including 81.8% of the Aspergillus.28 This compared with 94.1% and 88.6%, respectively, by routine laboratory methods. When the authors limited the study to only those species that were present in the database, 100% of the Aspergillus isolates were correctly identified.28 In another study the Vitek MS was able to correctly discriminate closely related Aspergillus species, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus lentulus.29 Schulthess et al. did a prospective study on 200 isolates using the Biotyper/Filamentous Fungi Library 1.0. They achieved a 79% species and 83.5% genus level identification. Particularly poor performance was noted for Mucor and Scopulariposis.30 Chen et al. evaluated 50 clinical mold isolates with the Biotyper and found that several were not identified or identified with a low score (<1.7).31 Twenty-eight isolates of Penicillium marneffei were not identified due to the lack of reference spectra in the database; however, the rate of identification went up to 85.7% after a single P. marneffei spectrum was added to the database. This result is consistent with a number of studies indicating high performance of MALDI on fungal isolates using custom databases.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37\n",

There are a few shortcomings of this technology. For the most part, MALDI is limited to cultured isolates, so although it offers tremendous TAT advantages it is inherently limited by the time to growth of the organism. Sparse database coverage over certain phyla (e.g., filamentous fungi, some anaerobes) presents an issue in some cases, although commercially available libraries continue to be expanded. Another major caveat of MALDI is that it is not yet a practical method for assessing antibiotic resistance. Direct detection of resistance-conferring enzymes is not practical within the assay's limits of detection; however, some promising studies have been published looking at the ability of MALDI to detect breakdown products after incubation in the presence of antibiotic.3 However, resistance testing is unlikely to be incorporated into a standard MALDI microbial identification platform in the near future.",

(Marlborough, Massachusetts) and consist of single-stranded DNA probes tagged with acridinium esters that hybridize to rRNA. Tests are read in a luminometer. Because there is no amplification, probe-based assays generally suffer low sensitivity and are reserved for culture confirmation, where organisms are present in high numbers. AdvanDX (Woburn, Massachusetts) has produced a series of probe-based assays using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes tagged with fluorescent markers.46 PNA probes have several advantages over traditional DNA probes, such as increased stability and ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall. Fluorescent tags have the added advantage of allowing for multicolor detection and the creation of limited panels. These are rapid assays (less than 1 hour) and are mostly targeted towards rapid diagnostics of positive blood culture bottles. The AdvanDX systems (PNA fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] and QuickFISH) offer a variety of testing options, such as Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus aureus [SA] vs coagulase-negative staphylococci [CNS]), Enterococcus (Enterococcus faecalis vs Enterococcus faecium or other enterococci), and gram negatives (E. coli vs Klebsiella pneumoniae, vs Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that can be chosen based upon the Gram stain results.47, 48, 49, 50 PNA probes have been used for rapid identification of organisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and mycobacteria, in human tissues sections for fresh, frozen, and FFPE.51, 52, 53, 54 In situ hybridization (ISH) of Epstein Barr encoding region for confirmation of Epstein-Barr virus infection on FFPE is routinely used in cancer diagnostics, but few, if any, other common viral infections are confirmed this way, with IHC being preferred. Application of RNA-ISH to Aspergillus and Candida in FFPE showed less sensitivity than real-time PCR with sequencing (gold standard), although some FISH-positive, PCR-negative cases with obvious fungal elements were seen, suggesting refinements of this technique may be valuable for rapid identification of these common organisms, especially if mucormycosis is in the differential.55\n",

            "text": "A unique probe-based approached to nucleic acid detection is the RNA hybridization and digital counting technology offered by NanoString (Seattle, Washington). This method uses a capture probe (usually a specific 50-mer) and a reporter probe (a second, adjacent, specific 50-mer attached to a unique molecular color barcode) to bind up individual molecules of RNA in a sample, capture them on a solid state matrix, and use digital imaging to count the barcodes in the sample. The current version can measure up to 500 independent capture:reporter pairs. The technology can be applied to any RNA target (human or microbial), and the great advantage in infectious disease is the extremely low input quantities that can be detected without interference from other RNA. Because of the counting algorithm, with proper probe selection in a given mixture, accurate quantification of RNA is possible without amplification. One pitfall to this technology is that the presence of any given target in a disproportionate ratio to other targets will flood the digital analysis (i.e., consider hemoglobin relative to cytokines in peripheral blood). Relative to sequencing, the technology remains expensive, but the benefit of quantification of extremely limited sample with minimal processing makes this an attractive target for future test development. For microorganisms, broad panels using signature genes and/or focused panels using genes in antibiotic metabolism pathways can be created. Studies in a range of diseases have shown that RNA from any source, including FFPE, is sufficient for NanoString analysis,56, 57, 58 In one study, quantitative expression of Plasmodium falciparum schizonts from human tissue (both frozen and FFPE) were measured and, using imputation, the entire expression profile for the organisms determined.59\n",

            "text": "Although PCR remains the most common means of nucleic acid amplification, other technologies have been developed that address the presence of single targets. Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) has been applied to mycobacteria, HCV, E. coli, and Listeria, where RNA is bound by a target oligo and then acted upon, in sequence, by reverse transcriptase (RT) (to produce cDNA), RNase H (to degrade RNA template), RT again to produce a double-stranded DNA promoter sequence, and then RNA polymerase to produce many copies of single-stranded RNA\u2014then the process repeats itself. Another isothermal reaction occurs in loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which uses a group of four to six primers and Bst DNA polymerase, with the creation of complimentary sites to generate exponentially amplified loop structures. These assays have been developed for a wide range of targets and produce larger quantities of DNA than traditional PCR in a matter of minutes to hours. This technique has been applied to viruses, bacteria, protists, fungi, and mycobacteria in a point of care manner.68, 69, 70, 71, 72 LAMP techniques are limited by the challenges of complex primer design, limited ability to multiplex, and common inhibitors of the enzymes in certain human samples, including blood. A last isothermal amplification is accomplished by the introduction of helicase, which unwinds DNA, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, which keep the templates separated. This is followed by primer hybridization and amplification to produce more single-stranded DNA and thus a continuous reaction. Assays to measure herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 using helicase have been developed with similar performance to traditional molecular methods and assays are available for Bordetella, group A Streptococcus, Trichomonas, and malaria.73 Commonly used platforms that use these technologies include the Tigris and Panther systems by Gen-Probe, which are based on TMA, SmMIT-LAMP based on LAMP, and AmpliVue based on helicase. Use of these assays in FFPE tissue has shown some promise with improved performance over PCR for some organisms (such as HCV in TMA), equivalent performance to PCR (such as human papillomavirus [HPV] in head and neck cancers with LAMP), and detection of limited signatures (such as microcarcinomas in small biopsies with helicase assays).74, 75, 76\n",

Despite this disparate situation, efforts have been made to approach parasitic infections, and thus the inherent challenges have become apparent. Extraction from stool for suspected parasite infections requires that protists (ciliates, ameoba, flagellates, coccidia), helminth larvae (nematodes), and helminth eggs (nematode, trematode, and cestode) be lysed sufficiently to release DNA efficiently. This challenge has led to eight or more different extraction protocols with a range of preparation requirements, including spin columns, automated magnetic bead assays, and \u201cbead beating\u201d methods. Molecular targets for subsequent detection assays as specific single targets across this range of organisms has included 18S rDNA, ITS, COX 1, pOV-46, 5.8S rDNA, Segment A, COWP, actin, HDP2, DL1, and 28S rDNA.87 In commercially available, multiplex PCR assays, the majority of the platforms target only Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, and, rarely, Cyclospora. Because these first three represent 80% to 99% of parasites isolated by all methods from stool in developed nations, additions of other much less common pathogens is not common. Inclusion of nonpathogenic ameba is common in these assays but of questionable value.",

Common bacterial pathogens include S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Listeria monocytogenes, although there are also several other, less frequently isolated, pathogens. Viral pathogens in these panels include the primary actionable viruses (Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella zoster virus), as well as other common viruses (Enterovirus, Parechovirus, and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6). Platforms also may include Cryptococcus species of fungi, which is very valuable in immunosuppressed populations.92 Current diagnostics are heavily focused on CSF biochemical profile (glucose, protein, lactate), cell count, and Gram stain. The latter is the most specific, but the limit of detection is approximately 10(4) organisms per milliliter.90 There is a great need for rapid molecular diagnostics in this area. In anatomic pathology, sample with culture and/or morphology with special stains and/or IHC can resolve many of these infections; however, optimal patient care and best outcomes occur in those patients who can be diagnosed early with these panels and not require an invasive biopsy.",

The rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections is critical for patient outcomes, with estimates of a 7.6% decrease in survival for every hour that appropriate antimicrobials are delayed after the onset of hypotension.98 The need for sensitive, fast detection, ideally accompanied by some assessment of antibiotic resistance determinants, has inspired a number of new technologies geared towards improved speed and sensitivity of blood culture diagnostics.

The pre-FDA evaluation was conducted both on archived samples and prospectively on a multicenter collection of 1560 samples of CSF. Among 235 archived samples (32 with bacteria), the percent positive and negative agreement was 100% for bacterial targets. Among the 1560 prospective samples, there were only eight with bacterial pathogens (none with L. monocytogenes or N. meningitides). Of those that were present, the FilmArray ME panel did not identify the only S. agalactiae. The archived arm of the evaluation included two S. agalactiae samples, both of which were correctly identified.106 Since FDA approval, one US study has been published on the performance of the panel in several Texas medical centers.

Verigene has a TAT of approximately 2 hours and has the advantage of offering flexible pricing by which the laboratory is charged only for the tests they request, instead of the entire panel. Disadvantages include the need to select the appropriate cartridge based on Gram stain results for bloodstream diagnostics. Respiratory, GI, and bloodstream panels are available.",

The GI panel is somewhat more limited than the FilmArray, covering 22 targets, including 13 bacteria, 5 viruses, and 4 parasites. Bacteria include the Campylobacter group, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio group, and Y. enterocolitica, as well as Shiga toxin. In one study of 725 stool samples the Verigene demonstrated a 98.5% agreement rate with culture.116 For the diagnosis of bloodstream infections, the Verigene system has separate cartridges for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, necessitating an accurate Gram stain to pick the appropriate test and making polymicrobial testing a bit more complicated. Each panel assesses a few extra organisms than the FilmArray single panel. In addition, the gram-negative panel queries several more resistance targets than the FilmArray, including CTX-M, IMP, NDM, OXA, and VIM.117 Verigene in RPs has excellent performance for the influenza viruses (A and B), including the ability to subtype viruses with perfect agreement with gold standard methods (molecular); however, mixed infections with non-influenza viruses dampen performance.118 Head-to-head comparisons of the limited Verigene panel (influenza A and B, RSV) with FilmArray RP showed equivalent detection of the three major pathogens at a slightly reduced cost for the Verigene; thus analysis of the clinical population and the desires of the local clinical team for reported virus and actionable diagnoses may help in choosing between these technologies.114\n",

One isobase is tagged with a fluorescent reporter, and the other is tagged with a quencher. Upon the successful generation of product, both isobases are incorporated and fluorescence decreases. A subsequent melt curve analysis is performed, and fluorescence is restored. Unlike the xTAG technology, MultiCode can be run on either commercially available real-time PCR systems or within the sample-to-result Aries platform from BD.

The gene is sequenced using primers that bind to the highly conserved regions and then compared with a reference database to identify an isolate.",

These variants were differentiated from each other by fewer than a dozen nucleotides.155 Other applications that are becoming more and more routine include the characterization of unusual pathogens, the tracking of antibiotic resistance genes, and even the characterization of the plasmids that carry them through horizontal gene transfer.156, 157, 158, 159 Although not yet routine, NGS has been used to diagnose infections directly from primary samples in cases in which all conventional techniques have failed.160 In one report, after 4 months of progressive neurologic symptoms and a thorough but unrevealing infectious disease workup, NGS was finally able to diagnose a case of neuroleptospirosis directly from the CSF of a 14-year-old boy.161\n",
