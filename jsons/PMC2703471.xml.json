Genome-wide studies examining anonymous markers spaced throughout the entire genome are not yet practical in ALI/ARDS. Rather, all studies thus far have used the candidate-gene approach, which focuses on specific genes whose products have been well characterized as biologically important in the pathogenesis, progression, or manifestation of ALI/ARDS [15]. The candidate-gene approach is hypothesis driven and founded on current knowledge of the disease process. The validity of the candidate gene rests on the evidence supporting its selection as a candidate in ALI/ARDS.\nTable 1 details the candidate genes that have been studied in ALI/ARDS and the evidence supporting their selection.",

Investigations into the genetic determinants of ALI/ARDS have been undertaken only recently. The selections of many of the candidate genes in recently published studies were supported by previously published reports in other, similar conditions, such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome for the SFTPB gene and sepsis for the TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, mannose binding lectin-2 (MBL-2), and IL-6 genes. Conversely, several candidate genes found to be associated with ARDS (ie, the +1580CT polymorphisms in the SFTPB gene, the T-1001G and C-1543T polymorphisms in the pre\u2013B-cell colony-enhancing factor [PBEF] gene, and the codon 54 polymorphism in the MBL-2 gene) were also found to be associated with increased risk for sepsis or septic shock in the same population [37], [38], [52]. Overall this finding suggests that genes and polymorphisms that have been implicated in sepsis would serve as strong candidate genes in ALI/ARDS.",

PBEF is a cytokine and adipokine with a variety of functions including the maturation of B-cell precursors, inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis, and stimulation of glucose uptake with action similar to insulin [5], [53]. Its role in ALI had not been reported until expression of the PBEF gene was found to be increased in a series of animal models of stretch and liposaccharide-induced lung injury and in vivo studies of patients who had ALI [25]. Other potential candidates in ALI/ARDS that had increased expression included genes previously suspected to be important, such as IL-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). PBEF protein expression also was increased in the lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum of patients who had ALI. After identifying two common-promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PBEF gene, Ye and colleagues [37] found that the variant of the T-1001G polymorphism was associated with increased risk of sepsis-induced ALI compared with healthy controls, whereas the variant C-1543T polymorphism was associated with a protective effect in sepsis-induced ALI compared with healthy adults.",

The direct approach focuses on the association between ALI/ARDS and specific polymorphisms, often SNPs, in the candidate gene that are thought to be functional, either because of linkage with other disease processes or because of the known effect on the levels, function, or effectiveness of the gene. Such an approach is effective for hypothesis testing but is limited to previously studied polymorphisms of a gene. This approach is the one most commonly used in ALI/ARDS.",

            "text": "Alternatively, the indirect approach examines all common SNPs in the gene (> 1% in a sample population), regardless of whether the SNPs have any functional significance. Often these SNPs are examined individually and in combination with other SNPs on the same gene. The term \u201chaplotype\u201d refers to two or more SNPs that are linked and tend to be inherited together en bloc. Multilocus haplotypes can be viewed as signature patterns of allelic variation on a gene that capture and characterize all polymorphisms within the haplotype block. The functional or disease polymorphism may be one of the loci genotyped, or it may reside within the haplotype block and be captured by the haplotype. Thus, the haplotype would serve as a surrogate marker for the functional polymorphism that is truly linked to the disease state. As such, some argue that haplotype analyses could identify functional or disease loci better than a single polymorphism, especially if the penetrance is low, as would be expected in complex diseases like ARDS [54], [55]. Haplotype analyses also can be more efficient in large epidemiology studies, because genotyping can be confined to the minimum number of SNPs that define that haplotype block (haplotype-tagging SNPs) [56]. Haplotype analyses also can capture cis interaction between SNPs. If one polymorphism increases the risk of disease only in the presence of another polymorphism in the same gene, haplotype analysis will be able to discern this relationship, whereas separate analyses of the polymorphisms will not. Last, haplotype analysis can help localize the disease locus to within the haplotype block in the gene and thus may help focus the search for functional variants in subsequent studies. The haplotype approach has become increasing popular in the genetic epidemiology of complex diseases, and this approach was used in the investigation of the PBEF and MLCK genes in ALI.",

Thus, the possibility that any candidate gene in ALI/ARDS can serve as a potential target for future preventive and therapeutic measures will rest on the strength of the evidence supporting its role as a candidate gene in ALI/ARDS. This evidence will not depend on any one genetic epidemiology study. Rather, it must be grounded in a series of genetic, molecular, bioinformatics, and clinical studies and confirmatory studies that support the biologic plausibility of the gene in ALI/ARDS.",

Rather, studies in ALI/ARDS have established the unrelated case-control study as an effective and well-validated design in the investigation of the genetic determinants of ALI/ARDS. Case-control studies require the delineation of a control group and focus on whether the gene of interest occurs at a significantly greater frequency among the patients who have the disease than among the controls. One of the most important advantages of case-control studies in complex disorders such as ALI is the power of the design. Association studies are the most sensitive and powerful of all of the study designs described thus far in detecting common, low-penetrant susceptibility genes in complex disease [12]. In addition, the case-control design is well suited to the study of genetic markers of disease. Genes are stable indicators of disease susceptibility, because they do not change with time or circumstances. The use of genetic markers as the exposure eliminates recall bias that often plagues case-control studies. Case-control studies also are amendable to multivariate modeling, which allows adjustment for important nongenetic factors and interactions.",

With increasing use of this design, however, comes some misuse as well. The most common and troubling criticisms of association studies are inconsistency and lack of reproducibility. This heterogeneity is caused by a number of factors. The epidemiologic quality of published genetic studies is quite variable [58]. Other factors include the lack of power in some studies (type II errors) and the lack of control for confounders such as population differences or gene\u2013environment interaction. As is true in any case-control design in epidemiology, the strength of the study depends entirely on the proper selection of cases and controls and on the appropriate accounting of the potential confounders, power and type I error [59]. The following section focuses on the features of genetic case-control design as illustrated by studies in ALI.\nTable 2 details some of these features and the results of recent genetic epidemiology studies in ALI/ARDS.",

Studies of susceptibility to developing ARDS are more relevant for future prevention, whereas studies on outcomes in ALI/ARDS are more relevant for treatment. In molecular epidemiology studies, factors important in susceptibility studies may not be important in prognostication of outcomes, and vice versa. For example, mutations in the BRCA1 gene, now known to be important in DNA repair, are associated with increased susceptibility to developing early-onset breast or ovarian cancer. However, the BRCA1 gene is not associated with differences in breast cancer recurrence or disease-free survival after therapy, even though BRCA1-associated breast cancer tends to present at a more advanced stage [64].",

Genetic epidemiology studies examining outcomes in ALI/ARDS usually use mortality or ventilator-free days as end points. The outcome of ALI/ARDS in genetic susceptibility studies is more heterogeneous and is prone to misclassification, because there is no definitive diagnostic test. The American-European Consensus criteria serve as a uniformly accepted guideline for defining lung injury, but certain criteria, specifically the radiologic criteria, are not always clear and are subject to interobserver variability [65]. In addition, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide to fraction of inspired oxygen represents a continuum of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The use of a cutoff of 300 mm Hg in the criteria for ALI will result in inevitable random misclassification of cases and controls that tends to bias results toward the null hypothesis. In addition, autopsy studies indicate that the American-European Consensus criteria for ALI/ARDS are sensitive but are not very specific [66]. Nevertheless, the American-European Consensus definition is used uniformly in the studies of ALI/ARDS. Care must be taken to assess carefully the rigor with which the cases adhere to the ALI/ARDS criteria. Similar attention also must be taken to ensure that controls do not actually have ARDS. Reliance on chart review and clinical diagnosis is inadequate, given recent evidence for the underdiagnosis of ALI/ARDS [67]. Thus, the same screening procedures used to determine the cases of ALI/ARDS should be applied to the controls to ensure that they do not also have the condition. Even so, misclassification will occur, and large, well-phenotyped sample sizes will be needed to detect an association.",

The controls in many of the studies of ALI/ARDS were healthy individuals or hospitalized patients who did not have a clear prior injury placing them at risk for ALI [21], [39], [49], [63]. As discussed previously, genes associated with sepsis are strong candidate genes for ALI, but because sepsis also is the leading precipitant for ALI, one must be careful to avoid confounding from a genetic association with the predisposing injury. When the controls are healthy or have conditions that differ from the precipitating injuries in the ARDS cases, any association found between a candidate gene and ALI/ARDS may actually be caused by an association between the polymorphism and the risk condition for ALI/ARDS, such as sepsis. It is important to use at-risk individuals who have similar conditions as the cases to avoid this confounder. In the investigation of the PBEF gene, both healthy individuals and patients who had sepsis were used as controls. The variant T-1001G and C-1543T alleles were found to be associated with the development of sepsis-associated ALI when compared with healthy controls, but no association was found between patients who had sepsis-associated ALI compared with sepsis patients who did not have ALI [37]. Thus, it is not clear whether the PBEF polymorphisms are associated with ALI or with the severe sepsis that placed the patients at risk for ALI. In a subsequent study in a different cohort of patients who had sepsis, trauma, aspiration, or multiple transfusions, the variant T-1001G, but not the C-1543T allele, was confirmed to be associated with ARDS compared with at-risk individuals [62]. This association was present even among patients who had ARDS of noninfectious origin, extending the generalizability of the genetic association.",

Many of the polymorphisms found to be associated with ALI/ARDS susceptibility or outcome, such as the insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 4 of the SFTP-B gene [71], the -308GA polymorphism in the TNF-\u03b1 gene [72], and the codon 54 polymorphism in the MBL-2 gene [73], are known to vary in frequency among major racial groups. This variation may be especially important when the haplotype approach is used. The extent of linkage disequilibrium and, hence, of haplotype blocks and frequencies differs between African Americans and non-Africans [74]. Thus, any genotype analysis must be restricted to one racial group or be stratified by race to avoid confounding from differences in ethnic groups (population stratification). In one study, haplotypes in the MLCK gene were found to be associated with variable susceptibility to developing sepsis-induced ALI in both American whites of European heritage and in African Americans [61]. Whites and African Americans differed in the linkage disequilibrium between SNPs and in haplotype block definition, however. Although significant associations between the gene and ALI were found, the disease-associated haplotypes differed between racial groups. The similar location of the race-specific at-risk haplotypes in whites and African Americans suggests that the true disease-associated variant may be located within the 5\u2032 region of the gene.",

This finding may be especially pertinent for whites in the United States, a classification that tends to be composed of many different ethnic subgroups. Similar results were found in the classification of African Americans that contained large numbers of ethnic subgroups [76].

In another polymorphism in the SFTPB gene, the C allele of +1580CT SNP was found to be associated with ARDS, but this association was confined to patients who had idiopathic insults, mostly direct pulmonary injuries such as pneumonia [39]. No associations were found in the group of patients who had exogenic ARDS, mostly extrapulmonary causes of ARDS [38]. Although healthy controls were used, a subsequent study using ARDS cases and controls who had community-acquired pneumonia confirmed this association between the C allele and ARDS, suggesting that the +1580C allele is associated with ALI/ARDS and not with severe pneumonia. Together, these studies suggest that the SFTPB gene may be important in ARDS susceptibility in direct pulmonary injuries such as pneumonia.

            "text": "Another source of potential gene\u2013environment interaction is age. Older patients have a higher risk than younger individuals of developing and dying from ARDS [4], [83]. In complex diseases, the genetic contribution may be greatest in diseases with an early age of onset rather than in a disease with a late age of onset, in which environmental factors such as comorbidities may figure more prominently. Potential interactions with age have been found in genetic epidemiology studies of ALI/ARDS. Among 212 patients who had ARDS, the \u2212308A allele was associated with more daily organ dysfunction and increased 60-day mortality in ARDS (adjusted OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4\u20138.6) after adjusting for age, severity of illness, septic shock, transfusion and other potential predictors [44]. Age seemed to be important, with the strongest association found among the 117 ARDS patients younger than median age of 67 years (adjusted OR, 14.9; 95% CI, 3.0\u201374; P < .001). In the same cohort of critically ill at-risk patients, the \u22121082GG genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to ARDS in critically ill patients (P < .001), but only in the presence of a statistically significant interaction between age and the \u22121082GG genotype [26]. When the nature of this interaction was explored further by stratifying the analyses by the median age of 67 years, the \u22121082GG genotype was protective against ARDS among the older (adjusted OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.34\u20131.2) but not among the younger patients (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.89\u20133.2), with significant effect modification by age of the association between \u22121082GG and ARDS (P < .001). Further study with a larger sample size is needed to confirm and define better the age effect on the genetic susceptibility to developing and dying from ARDS. If such interaction does exist, future interventions aimed at preventing and treating ARDS may have variable efficacy, depending on the age of the individual.",

Although adjustment for multiple comparisons is ideal, it is not entirely clear what the best strategy is, and current studies of ALI/ARDS may still too small to accommodate statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Ultimately, the likelihood of a cause-and-effect relationship underlying any genetic association will depend on the reproducibility of well-designed studies in different populations and in the strength of the biologic rationale behind the selection of that gene for analysis.

Rather, multiple genes with incomplete penetrance and much gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interaction will be important in ALI/ARDS. As such, expecting gene therapy to correct a specific disease-causing mutation or locus is unrealistic. More likely, genetic epidemiology studies may help identify important pathways in the pathogenesis and evolution of lung injury and new therapeutic targets within these pathways for intervention. Hence, the potential of any gene or its product in the future prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS will depend greatly on the strength of the evidence supporting the biologic role for the candidate gene in ALI/ARDS. In such cases, a multidisciplinary translational approach involving genetic epidemiology, functional genomics, animal models, and bioinformatics will be important. The translational approach may be bidirectional [86]. The \u201cbenchside\u201d work may occur before the association study to lend support to its selection as a candidate gene, as was the case with the PBEF and MLCK genes [37], [61]. Alternately, such investigation may occur after the association study to explain better the nature of the genetic association. For example, after an association between the D allele in the angeiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and ARDS was reported, greater support for the role of ACE in lung injury was established when the loss of ACE activity in ACE-knockout mice was found to protect against lung injury [20]. In contrast, mice deficient in ACE 2, a homologue of ACE, were more susceptible to sepsis and endotoxin-induced lung injury. Inactivation of the ACE gene reduced the injury seen in these ACE 2-knockout mice. These results lend greater strength to the biologic plausibility of ACE in the development of ARDS and, consequently, its potential as a target for intervention.",

In the past, clinical trials of surfactant replacement in ARDS and anti-TNF therapy in sepsis have proved disappointing. It is possible that these therapies may not be beneficial in all patients. For example, anti-TNF therapy may be beneficial only for patients who are genetically predisposed to be exuberant TNF secretors. Anti-TNF therapy may be useless or even detrimental in patients who have the low TNF-secreting genotypes. Such genotype-dependent responses to therapy were demonstrated with recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-ra) and the rare IL-1ra +3954 allele in rheumatoid arthritis and with salmeterol therapy and a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor genotype in asthma [87], [88]. Better risk assessment of the patient, based on the patient's genetic profile and likelihood of response or adverse reaction to an intervention, will allow better design of future clinical trials. Future trials can target specific patient populations that have genotypes that are more likely to respond. Alternatively, patients can be stratified on the basis of their genotype to allow analyses of drug response by genotype. Given the acuity of the condition, the targeting of individuals who have a certain genotype or the stratification of subjects by genotype before randomization will require rapid and accurate genotyping assays that are not yet available.",

There is a need for a better understanding of the concerns of the patients and their surrogates and how best to protect those interests. In addition, the racial difference in ALI means that large cohorts of minority groups will be vital to determine the efficacy of an intervention in different racial groups.",

For example, ALI/ARDS develops rapidly after the initial injury with a median of 1 day after admission to the ICU (interquartile range, 0\u20135 days) [2], [79]. Such a narrow window for intervention requires rapid identification of appropriate patients for intervention and initiation of intervention as early as possible, possibly in the emergency room. Therapy based on a specific genotype would require either rapid DNA testing or prior genotyping of all patients and storage of this information, either in the medical record or in a secure device on the persons themselves. Neither of these measures is available currently.",

Optimal study designs and approaches are still being discussed, and the large, prospective cohorts that will be necessary to examine gene\u2013environment interaction and to confirm prior findings are being developed. There will be technological and analytic challenges to the proper study of genetic determinants of ALI/ARDS that will benefit from a multifaceted approach. There will be significant barriers to the translation of genetic epidemiology studies and genomics to preventive and therapeutic interventions, and any intervention is unlikely to occur in the near future. In oncology, where there is a longer history of genetic and molecular epidemiology studies, commercially available genetic tests now allow individualized risk assessment and tailored therapy for breast cancer. Although significant challenges lie ahead, there is a similar potential for such individualized risk assessment and therapy in critical care medicine. Large, well-phenotyped studies will be crucial to this goal.",
