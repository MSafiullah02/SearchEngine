Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane (TM) spanning \u03b1\u2010helix and a short cytoplasmic tail.1 Different types of \u03b1 integrins can combine with different \u03b2 counterparts, forming a variety of heterodimers. In humans, 18 \u03b1\u2010chains can interact with eight different \u03b2\u2010chains to form 24 different \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers with varied functions.2 By spanning the membrane, the integrins serve as a dynamic linkage between cytoplasm and extracellular space, transducing signals across the membrane to mediate cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, motility, and apoptosis.3 Inside\u2010out signal transduction involves integrin cytoplasmic tails separation and subsequent ectodomain conformational changes, which alters the affinity of integrins for extracellular ligands.4, 5, 6\n",

The importance of this and other related motifs in \u03b1\u2010helical TM domains has been later been demostrated in exhaustive statistical analyses.20 Further, a selection of a random library of TM sequences for homodimerization clearly showed that the GxxxG motif is sufficient for strong helix\u2013helix interactions.21 Using the TOXCAT assay,22 a test that measures the oligomerization of a chimeric protein containing a TM helix in the Escherichia coli inner membrane via transcriptional activation of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a sequence critical for integrin \u03b1IIb\u2010TM homodimerization that involved the GxxxG motif was suggested by Li et al.17\n",

Also, some forms may be transient or not abundant, and they may be difficult to detect experimentally. One of the ways, although arguably indirect, to enquire on the existence and biological relevance of a given protein\u2013protein interaction is to test its stability using evolutionary conservation data, using the idea that none of the mutations appeared during evolution, and present in homologous sequences, disrupt a native interaction. The general idea for this strategy is illustrated in Figure 2(A), which shows an example of results obtained in the present work for some of the \u03b1 integrin sequences.",

Indeed, only in these conditions the correct structure of M2 could be found.26 In the absence of experimentally determined helix tilt, the only alternative is to sample the helix tilt at small intervals, and we have recently followed this helix tilt sampling approach to find evolutionary conserved models of the transmembrane homooligomers of coronavirus envelope protein E.27\n",

The rotational orientation angle \u03c9 of a residue is defined by the angle between a vector perpendicular to the helix axis, oriented towards the middle of the peptidic C=O bond of the residue, and a plane that contains both the helical axis and the normal to the bilayer.

Related to this, we note that in previous reports we have used homologous sequences, found in different species, of a given protein. Here, in contrast, we have used different integrins types, which perform very different functions, in the same species (humans). This is clearly a more stringent condition for finding conserved interactions, as the variability in the sequences is potentially greater. The lack of a sufficient number of suitable homologous sequences of the same integrin type for different species, precluded the determination of a similar structure to model II in sequences \u03b13 and \u03b12, although it is possible that a similar interaction, that is, one that does not involve the GxxxG motif, is also present there.",

For example, the helix tilt for our \u03b1 homodimeric model I [see Fig. 4(a)] is 19\u00b0, which corresponds to a crossing angle of 38\u00b0 for a symmetric dimer. This is remarkably consistent with a \u201cmodel I\u2010like\u201d \u03b1IIb homodimer proposed by W.F. DeGrado and coworkers based on an exhaustive search of rigid\u2010helix interactions and mutagenesis data17 where a modified motif, VGxxGG instead of GVxxG for GpA, was proposed. In the model I we report, residues G972 and G976, that pertain to the GxxxG motif (see residues 28 and 32 in Fig. 1, top panel) interact with V969 and V973 of the other helix (number 25 and 29 in Fig. 1, top panel). Also, mutations at L980, L980A, and L980V, which have been reported to greatly increase homodimerization17 are involved in the interaction. In contrast to this latter report,17 however, calculations of the interaction energy per residue (Fig. 6) in the \u03b1IIb dimer model I do not show that the residues preceeding G in the GxxxG motif (i.e, residues V971 and G975) are important for the interaction. Our results for model I are therefore more consistent with a typical GpA type mode of interaction in all integrins. The discrepancy between these results may be due to the different strategy used and the ambiguity in mutagenesis studies; for example, G975L or G975V was found to impair dimerization, but G975A was as dimerizing as the native residue.17 Small details aside, because we find that this homodimeric model I has been conserved through all integrin types, the model described for \u03b1IIb17 is just a particular instance of a more general form of interaction that includes all \u03b1 representatives, as has been also suggested by experiments involving other integrin TM domains.16\n",

The putative coexistence of integrin hetero\u2010 and homo\u2010oligomers has been rationalized in a context where heteromeric interactions would stabilize the transmembrane region in a low\u2010affinity and/or intermediate affinity state,11 whereas homooligomers would be present in the active state, crosslinking individual molecules, and stabilizing focal adhesions.33 Consistent with this hypothesis, \u03b23 TM homotrimerization induced constitutive activation and integrin clustering, suggesting a push\u2013pull mechanism,14 although other studies failed to detect homomeric interactions after \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin activation.11 Nevertheless, a role for integrin transmembrane homomeric interactions in integrin clustering when binding to multimeric ligands36 is possible. The fact that several homomeric interactions are evolutionary conserved strongly support this possibility.",

We have found that two modes of interaction are evolutionarily conserved. One of these interactions (model I) involves the GxxxG\u2010like motif, which has been proposed previously on the basis of mutagenesis data in the transmembrane domains. The other model (model II) involves the opposite face of the helix, which is consistent with previous experimental data. Because our models have been obtained with independence of any previous experimental restraint and only using the perturbing effect of evolutionary conservation data as a filtering parameter, we suggest that these interactions are present in vivo. The present studies provide a fertile ground for experimentation. We are presently studying the in vivo effects of these potentially disruptive mutations in the integrin transmembrane domain.",

For each sequence, similar low\u2010energy structures (typically, backbone RMSD lower than 1 \u00c5) are grouped in clusters and averaged. These averaged low\u2010energy structures are indicated with symbols here, and are plotted on a plane described by helix tilt and rotational orientation for an arbitrarily chosen residue (here \u03c933). After considering the results from all sequences tested, a \u201ccomplete set\u201d is a group of these structures that contains representatives from all sequences.
