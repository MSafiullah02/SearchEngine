On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes a \"public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)\". On February 11, 2020, the International Virus Classification Commission named this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 On the same day, WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection as coronavirus disease . 2 On January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of China categorized COVID-19 as a Class B infectious disease but administered it as a Class A infectious disease. 3 Many countries and regions were involved in this epidemic and the number of infected cases continues to increase. Some countries and regions implemented very stringent prevention and control measures. Preventing and controlling the epidemic while ensuring the orderly flows of pediatric surgery clinical work has proven to be a big challenge for both patients and clinicians during the epidemic period. Several publications that introduced the prevention strategies for surgical operations during the COVID-19 epidemic have been launched. [4] [5] [6] Because children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, 7-9 several diagnostic guidelines or consensuses for children were published. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] However, thus far, no publications providing systemic suggestions or strategies for prevention of COVID-19 in the field of pediatric surgery have been identified.",

The virus can also be transmitted through close contact (such as touching the mouth or nose, or conjunctiva by contaminated hands). Aerosol and fecal-oral transmission remain to be confirmed. In addition, it is currently uncertain whether the virus can be transmitted through mother-to-child vertical transmission Open access or through breast milk. The population is generally susceptible.

Fever and coughing are often observed, as well as fatigue, myalgia, stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Blood routine leukocyte counts and absolute lymphocyte counts are mostly normal. The lung image is characterized by ground glass shadow on the outside of the lung. Mild manifestations mainly show acute upper respiratory infections, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing. While physical examination reveals congestion in the pharynx, no positive signs exist in the lungs. Some children may have no fever or may have only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; the common cases show symptoms of pneumonia, frequent fever, and cough, and mostly dry cough followed by sputum cough. Some may have wheezing, but no obvious hypoxia such as shortness of breath. Lungs can hear sputum or dry snoring and/or wet snoring. Some children did not have any clinical symptoms and signs, but chest CT showed lung lesions, which were diagnosed subclinical. Most cases with children are mild or subclinical; severe cases show early respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough and can be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. This usually progresses around one week. Patients have difficulty breathing, have central cyanosis, or do not take oxygen hypoxic manifestations such as inferior pulse blood oxygen saturation <0.92; critically ill cases can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or to respiratory failure and also may develop shock, encephalopathy, myocardial injury or heart failure, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, and other multiple organ dysfunctions, which can be life threatening. 18 Criteria for the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases in children [12] Suspected cases: with any one of the following epidemiological histories and any two of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis can be made. Epidemiological history: (1) traveling or living in areas with continuous local transmission cases within two weeks before the onset; (2) contact with patients in fever or with respiratory symptoms from areas with continuous local transmission cases within two weeks before the onset; (3) have a history of close contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 within two weeks before the onset of disease; (4) have clustering onset: in addition to this child, there are other patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, including suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases; (5) babies given birth by pregnant women with suspected or confirmed neonatal COVID-19. Clinical manifestations: (1) fever, fatigue, dry cough, some children may have no fever or low fever; (2) above-mentioned imaging manifestations; (3) white blood cell count is normal or decreased in the early stage of onset, or the lymphocyte count is reduced.",

For windowless rooms or storage rooms, regular mechanical exhaust and ultraviolet disinfection are required. The ventilation should be ensured in recovery room for 24 hours by exhaust equipment. The frequency of ultraviolet disinfection changes from once a day to twice a day for dressing rooms, treatment rooms and recovery rooms. Disinfectant with effective chlorine in concentration of 1000 mg/L can be wiped or sprayed twice a day on the floor and in the corridors of the ward. Wet cleaning shall be kept during ground wiping, and disinfection shall be carried out promptly in case of pollution. (3) Proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in patient-care areas: the surfaces frequently touched by children and their parents in the ward (such as bedrails, headboard, bedside tables, pagers, monitors, doorknobs, and so on) should be disinfected with effective chlorine containing disinfectant using a concentration of 1000 mg/L for 30 min every day and then wiped by clean water. Corrosion-susceptible items are sterilized by wiping with 75% ethanol twice. Thermometers, stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, and other medical equipment (such as goggles without obvious pollution) should be disinfected with 75% ethanol twice after use. (4) Medical staff precautions: medical staffs are at risk of cross infection as they need to face many people, including the patients, their parents, and other medical staff. All departments of a healthcare should educate and train healthcare personnel on the principles and recommended practices of COVID-19 Standard Precautions. Reasonable shift arrangement and shift system implementation are also required. Medical staffs should self-monitor whether they have fever, dry cough, fatigue, and other symptoms and should report their status to the relevant departments of healthcare daily. If any associated symptoms are present, essential monitor and isolation procedures should be performed as soon as possible. Healthcare personnel should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, such as surgical mask, goggles, face shield, disposable caps, gloves, before carry out routine medical work. Precautions should be strictly observed according to \"The technical guidelines for the prevention and control of the new coronary virus infections in medical institutions (first edition)\" when healthcare workers perform the procedures such as change dressing, remove drainage or change ostomy bag and expose to patients' blood, body fluids or excretions. Proper hand washing is effective precaution in preventing transmission of viruses. Healthcare personnel should abide by the principles of hand hygiene before and after having direct contact with patients and after removing gloves. 24 (5) Precautions for non-healthcare professionals. Gatherings of many non-healthcare professionals increase the transmission risk of infectious agents in surgical wards. Thus, it is crucial to strengthen the precautions for patients, their parents, accompanying persons, and the cleaning staff. Health education for hospitalized children and their parents should be strengthened in each department, and patients' parents need to sign the \"Commitment for the special epidemic notification\" before admission. Only one parent was recommended to accompany the children, and any visitor should be refused. Patients and accompanying family members should reduce their activity space to lessen the transmission risk. Wearing a mask is necessary in the ward public area. When coughing or sneezing, one's month and nose need to be covered with a tissue or with one's elbow. Washing hands and disinfection is required after contact with respiratory secretions, before meals, and after toileting. Keep the room ventilated. The temperature of the patients, their parents, and the cleaning staff need to be measured twice a day, and any associated symptom should be reported to the special medical professional, such as fever, cough, or fatigue.",

It is recommended to choose anesthetic methods and medicine with minimal impact on child on the basis of ensuring safety and painlessness of children, as well as safety of medical workers meanwhile. For pediatric patients that cry more often and do not cooperate, appropriate sedation can be applied before surgery to reduce the risk of transmission of saliva and droplet. The three-level protection measures are required for anesthesiologists, and one more layer of gloves is necessary before intubation during the endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, then be removed after the completion of intubation. Medication should be used on those who have venous access as soon as possible to get sedation after entering the room, and sevoflurane inhalation can be applied on those without venous access to get sedation, followed by the establishment of venous access. Before anesthesia induction, double layer of warm and moist gauzes should be used to cover the mouth and nose of patient, followed by mask sustained high flow preoxygenation. It is recommended that to choose rapid anesthesia induction, moderate sedation and sufficient muscle relaxant are necessary to avoid choking cough, and intubation should be performed by skilled pediatric anesthesiologists under optimal conditions for high success rate. In case of difficult airway, the laryngeal mask should be placed after the failure of the first endotracheal intubation (attempt) to avoid the risk of infection caused by repeated attempts of endotracheal intubation. To avoid being close to operating area, the use of visual laryngoscope will be required.

Monitoring should be strengthened during operation, and severe patients are required to be closely monitored and dealt with in time due to the possible existence of acute lung injury, ARDS, heart failure, acid-base imbalance, and electrolyte disorders. At the end of the operation, the endotracheal tube should be removed under deep sedation with strengthening monitoring. It is recommended that complete the sputum suction work before the child wake up and appropriate injection of lidocaine before extubation. The mouth and nose of patient should be covered with two warm and moist gauzes to reduce the secretion spatter caused by choking cough as much as possible. Antagonists are not recommended. The filter at the end of the tracheal catheter is required to be kept during extubation. The work of postoperative analgesia is necessary to reduce crying and restlessness of children after extubation. The patient needs to be transferred to the isolation ward directly for continued treatment when Steward recovery scores are \u22655 points after extubation with an observation in the operation. Those severe patients need to be transferred to isolation ICU directly with keeping trachea catheter. It is recommended to deepen the anesthesia or add appropriate dosage of muscle relaxant before transferring. (2) Intraoperative precautions: general open operations refer to the \"Health workers Wear Protection Gear Procedures.\" The contamination, caused by mixture of gas when cutting tissues, should be avoided during laparoscopic surgery in operating room. In addition to the precautions of patients' blood, secretions, and excrements during the operation, special attention should be paid to the aerosol produced when using electrosurgical equipment such as electric knife. The electric knife should be used matching with the minimum effective power and the smoke absorbing device. Doctors and nurses should operate accurately and normatively to avoid injuries caused by knife, suture needle, and other instruments. Participants are asked to remove the protective equipment according to the \"Health workers Wear Protection Gear Procedures\" after the operation, and leave through the special passageway.",

According to the Double-medical team leader system, the patient who was transferred to the isolation ward should be managed by leaders from isolation ward and surgical team. Precautions should be strictly observed during transshipment. Transfer flatbed covered with disposable sheets is required to be thoroughly disinfected by disinfectant with effective chlorine in concentration of 2000 mg/L after transfer. (2) Operating room management: the operation room is fumigated and disinfected with peroxyacetic acid after turning off the operation laminar flow and air supply. The high efficiency filter of the operation is required to be replaced in time by notifying laminar flow engineers and technicians. Contaminants should be removed from floor, wall, and articles in the operating room, which should be sprayed and wiped by disinfectant with effective chlorine in concentration of 2000 mg/L, at least 30 min each time. Then, the floor should be mopped by clean water. The surface and air sampling test in operation should be carried out after disinfection by contacting the infection management department, and operation can be used again after the Open access results are qualified. Turn on laminar flow and ventilation for at least 2 hours. (3) Management of objects and specimens during operation: after operation, the reusable devices and cloths need to be sprayed with moisturizer, sealed, and packed with double-layer of yellow plastic bag, affixed with the \"SARS-CoV2\" logo and the name of the article, and placed separately. The supply center staffs are called to collect them in time for the subsequent disinfection. Disposable articles, medical protection equipment, and body fluid, flushing fluid generated by suspected or confirmed patients with SARS-CoV2 infection should be placed and sealed in double-layer of yellow medical waste bags, affixing with the \"SARS-CoV2\" logo outside. Then, those bags should be placed separately and processed as infectious medical waste. The specimen bag, labeling with \"SARS-CoV2,\" was sent to the pathology department for diagnosis. (4) Medical record of operation: in addition to the information of patients, the \"Infectious Diseases Registration Form\" should be filled by surgeon in time, as well as updating of the diagnosis of suspected cases and the surgical recovery status of patients. (5) Follow-up management: patients are transferred to the designated negative pressure isolation ward. Precautions should be strictly observed according to \"Technical Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infections in Medical Institutions (first edition)\" when medical workers entering the isolation ward for rounds, dress changing, and nursing. 17 (6) Discharge criteria: different from the usual surgical discharge criteria, the consultation of hospital COVID-19 Expert Group needs to be considered that whether can be discharged or need continuous home isolation with disease control and monitoring for those patients who still need further isolation after surgery according to the regulations.",
