Zoonotic transmission of CoVs such as the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, on the other hand, may be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection. This article reviews the clinical and pathological data available on MERS and compares it to SARS. Most importantly, chest radiographs and imaging results of patients with MERS show features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia, different from the lesions in SARS patients, which show fibrocellular intra-alveolar organization with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like pattern. These findings are in line with differences in the induction of cytopathological changes, induction of host gene responses and sensitivity to the antiviral effect of interferons in vitro when comparing both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The challenge will be to translate these findings into an integrated picture of MERS pathogenesis in humans and to develop intervention strategies that will eventually allow the effective control of this newly emerging infectious disease.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positivesense RNA viruses that infect birds and a wide range of mammals, including humans. These viruses are composed of a few structural proteins that hold a relatively long (around 30 kb) positive-stranded genome ( Figure 1 ). They occur worldwide and can cause diseases of medical and veterinary significance. Generally, infections are localized to the respiratory, enteric and/or nervous systems, although systemic disease has been observed in a number of host species [1, 2] . At present, six CoVs have been identified that infect humans. Human CoVs HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 predominantly cause a mild respiratory tract infection, characterized by upper respiratory tract disease that includes coryza, cough and sore throat. These viruses only occasionally induce lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, two recently emerged CoVs induce a more severe lower respiratory infection that may be fatal, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) [10, 11] . The SARS outbreak started in 2002 in China and, after rapid global spread through human-to-human transmission, was halted in 2004. The number of cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) was 8096, including 774 deaths [12] . Ten years later, the MERS outbreak started in the Middle East and is still ongoing. A total number of 837 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO, including 291 fatalities [13] .",

            "text": "So far, reports describing autopsies of fatal MERS-CoV cases have not been published. Therefore, at this stage one can only speculate about the pathology of MERS-CoV in humans. However, further insight into the pathogenesis and pathological potential of MERS-CoV may be obtained by comparing and contrasting the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and host cell response of MERS-CoV to infection with SARS-CoV, which may also cause a life-threatening lower respiratory tract disease. receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the emergence of MERS-CoV in humans from dromedary camels, and potentially earlier in time from bats, is facilitated ( Figure 2 ). Human-to-human spread of MERS-CoV does not seem to be efficient but is reported in hospital outbreaks and travellers returning from the Middle East and their close contacts [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The hospital outbreaks are mostly due to person-to-person transmission in haemodialysis units, intensive care units or in-patient units, where patients are infected with MERS-CoV of a single monophyletic clade [23] . An outbreak among healthcare workers in a hospital was due to overcrowding and inadequate infection control measures [25] . It is still unclear whether the transmission through person-to-person contact occurs via large respiratory droplets, due to coughing and sneezing, as in SARS, or via fomites [23, 25, 26] . Also, the episodes of transmission are not clearly defined but are reported to take place during both the symptomatic and the incubation phases [20] . Repeated testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) at different time points will be needed to provide a better understanding [20] . Some of the larger clusters of patients observed in Al Hasa and Jeddah may be primarily related to human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, but super-spreader events, as described during the SARS outbreak, have not been noted thus far. This may be due to an overall lower level of virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract contributing to lower transmissibility than seen in SARS [26] . As a result, the outbreak is more restricted when compared to SARS, although future adaptations of MERS-CoV in humans may potentially increase human-to-human transmission or may alter the virulence of the virus, causing more severe disease.",

Dromedary camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show disease but still may excrete MERS-CoV CoVs in bats that also use DPP4 as an entry receptor through nasal fluids, faeces and, potentially, in their milk and urine [27] . Therefore, the WHO recommends avoiding contact with camels, not drinking raw camel milk or camel urine and not eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked. Also, people who work, or come into contact with, dromedary camels, such as people working at camel farms, slaughterhouses, markets and camel-racing facilities, and also veterinarians, are at risk and should practise good personal hygiene and wear facial protection and protective clothing where feasible [28] .",

The median incubation period of a MERS-CoV infection is 5 days [20] . Current data indicate that, overall, more men than women have become infected, with a median age of 47 years (range 9 months-94 years), and most fatalities are observed in patients over 60 years [20, 22] . Clinical symptoms observed include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, myalgia, chest pain, malaise and gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Less common symptoms include chills, wheezing, palpitations and confusion [20] [21] [22] 29] . Respiratory symptoms are mainly related to lower respiratory tract disease (dyspnoea, cough and fever), while upper respiratory tract disease is reported infrequently. A large proportion of the severely ill patients required mechanical ventilation [30] . Interestingly, many of the reported secondary cases showed mild respiratory symptoms or were asymptomatic [31] . Radiology of MERS patients revealed mild to severe pulmonary consolidation. Chest radiographs of a large percentage of the patients admitted to hospital showed airspace and interstitial opacities, with subtle to extensive, unilateral to bilateral, and focal to diffuse distribution. Air space opacities are variable in their distribution, described as reticular or reticulonodular, and demonstrate thickening of bronchovascular areas [20, 21, 32] . Computed tomography (CT) examination of hospitalized patients with MERS revealed bilateral, mostly subpleural and basilar, airspace involvement, with ground-glass opacities and limited consolidation. The fact that most lesions were found in the subpleural and peribronchovascular region is suggestive of organizing pneumonia [32] .",

Although virus is detected in urine and blood of some MERS patients, this is not a consistent finding [26, 35, 36] , but indicates that systemic infection can occur. Potential risk factors for the development of severe disease are obesity, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, cardiac disease, hypertension, lung disease, including asthma and cystic fibrosis, and any immunosuppressive condition [20] [21] [22] [23] 29, 30] . Complications described in fatal cases are hyperkalaemia with associated ventricular tachycardia, disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to cardiac arrest, pericarditis and multi-organ failure [21] . One report demonstrated stillbirth during MERS-CoV infection [38] . When compared to a case-control group, MERS patients were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and had a higher mortality rate [22] . The survival rate in patients detected via the active surveillance system was higher than in the clinically identified cases [23] . Co-infections with other pathogens are also described frequently, but their relevance as a critical factor for disease progression is uncertain [20, 29, 32] .",

There are only small differences in 178 JMA van den Brand et al the median incubation period, a slightly longer time for MERS (5.2 days) than for SARS (4 days). In SARS, a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms is described, similar to that seen in MERS; fever, chills, diarrhoea and pneumonia [39] . In both conditions severely ill patients presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure that often required mechanical ventilation. Although both viruses are considered respiratory viruses, gastro-intestinal infections and symptoms have been described in both SARS and MERS patients. The case-fatality rate may seem higher for MERS-CoV (around 30%) than for SARS-CoV (9.6%), but whether this is the result of a higher virulence of MERS-CoV is not clear, since many MERS-CoV infections may have gone unnoticed. Similar co-morbidities have been described for both MERS and SARS. In MERS when compared to SARS, predominantly diabetes type 2 and chronic renal disease are important co-morbidities [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . In SARS, age is a significant risk factor for the development of severe disease; similarly, for MERS, most fatalities occur in patients aged > 60 years [20, 22] . The laboratory findings more often showed higher levels of parameters associated with liver and kidney dysfunction in SARS than in the described cases of MERS, although acute renal failure is often seen in MERS. Complications during pregnancy, such as maternal mortality and stillbirth, have been described in SARS and thus far only rarely seen in MERS cases, but that may be attributable to decreased maternal tolerance to hypoxia and reduced fetal oxygen flow due to respiratory disease [38] .",

In the absence of accurate follow-up of MERS patients, there is limited information on the exact course of the disease in the long term.

The rhesus macaques developed increased body temperatures at 1-2 days post-infection (dpi) and transient clinical signs, such as increased respiration rate and cough. Haematology showed an increase in total white blood cells and neutrophils from 1-2 dpi and a decrease in lymphocytes from 1-2 dpi [60] . Radiographic imaging revealed localized infiltration and interstitial markings. By gross pathology on 3 dpi, there was congestion and little indication of acute pneumonia. By histopathology on 3 dpi, there was a multifocal mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septa with oedema, fibrin and few macrophages and neutrophils, intraluminal alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and multinucleated giant cells, fibrin and sloughed epithelial cells; perivascular inflammatory infiltrates were present in the interstitium [62] . At 6 dpi there was type II pneumocyte hyperplasia with alveolar oedema, fibrin deposition and hyaline membranes [60] . In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated the presence of virus RNA and antigen expression in type I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. In rhesus macaques inoculated intratracheally, virus was present in the lungs at 3 dpi, but not in nasal, oropharyngeal or rectal swabs or organs (kidney, trachea, brain, heart, liver, spleen, intestine) by RT-PCR and virus titration [62] . In rhesus macaques with a combined inoculation route, virus was present predominantly in nasal swabs at 1 and 3 dpi, but not in urogenital and rectal swabs. Virus was also present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the respiratory tract, but not in the kidney. Up-regulation of expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines for chemotaxis and neutrophil activation, such as IL-6, CXCL1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)4, was seen in the serum [60] . Similarly, cynomolgus macaques can be infected with MERS-CoV and show virus replication in the lower respiratory tract but, in the lungs, only limited infiltration was observed at different days after infection (van den Brand et al, unpublished observations; Figure 3 ).",

Hocke et al [69] demonstrated widespread MERS-CoV antigen expression in type I and II alveolar cells, ciliated bronchial epithelium and unciliated cuboid cells of terminal bronchioles, using spectral confocal microscopy. Virus antigen was also found in endothelial cells of pulmonary vessels and rarely in alveolar macrophages. Electron microscopy revealed alveolar epithelial damage, consisting of detachment of type II alveolar epithelial cells and associated disruption of tight junctions, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing, the latter suggesting apoptosis [69] . Although this ex vivo model does not fully mimic the situation in vivo, these changes are in line with observations in cell lines infected with MERS-CoV. Severe cytopathic effects were observed in human hepatoma cells infected with MERS-CoV; these were more severe than those due to SARS-CoV infection [70] , although the in vivo relevance of this observation remains unclear.",

A comparative analysis of HCoV receptor expression across the respiratory tract of humans may provide clues regarding differences in pathobiology between HCoVs. In cell lines and ex vivo lung cultures, DPP4 is expressed in type I and II alveolar cells, ciliated and non-ciliated bronchial epithelium, bronchial submucosal glands, endothelium, alveolar macrophages and leukocytes [68, 71] . This largely corresponds with viral tropism in ex vivo human lung cultures, which show infection of non-ciliated cells in bronchi, bronchioles, endothelial cells and type I and II pneumocytes, but rarely in alveolar macrophages [68, 71, [75] [76] [77] [78] .

At present, only one comparative in vitro study using MERS-CoV has been performed [87] . Calu3 cells, differentiated into polarized ciliated cells, permit replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at similar levels. However, MERS-CoV induces a substantial cytopathic effect, starting 18-24 h after infection, whereas SARS-CoV maintains steady replication and cell viability until 72 h after infection [70, 77, 87] . On the other hand, MERS-CoV seems more sensitive to prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of infection in vitro than SARS-CoV [70] . In addition, MERS-CoV induces much greater dysregulation of the host response to infection than SARS-CoV. MERS-CoV specifically down-regulates genes involved in the antigen-presentation pathway, which could have substantial implications for the development of adaptive immune responses [87] . With respect to the analysis of the immune response in humans infected with MERS-CoV, limited data from two patients with different disease outcomes are available to date. In BAL and serum from the patient with a poor outcome, there was a decrease in interferon (IFN)\u03b1 as well as decreased expression of retinoic inducible-acid gene (RIG)-1, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF)3 and IRF7, which are involved in the recognition of viruses by the innate immune system. In the patient with poor outcome there were also high levels of CXC-motif chemokines ligand (CXCL)10 and interleukin (IL)-10, which may have resulted in lower IFN\u03b3 expression and higher levels of IL-17A and IL-23 [88] . In the patient who survived, rapid clearance of the virus with increased levels of IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 was noted [88] .",

            "text": "At this time it is difficult to describe or predict the pathology of severe respiratory disease from MERS-CoV infection. First, there are no reports on autopsies of human fatal MERS cases. This is partly related to the religious backgrounds of the patients, which exclude autopsy. Although limited numbers of human fatal SARS patients have been described, these studies indicate an immunopathological component that may dominate the pathogenesis of SARS. Second, to gain more knowledge of fatal MERS in humans, further studies are needed in animal models that could provide information on replication dynamics, clinical disease, histological lesions and cellular tropism. Third, the patients with severe MERS have very diverse pre-existing conditions, and therefore it may be difficult to obtain definite answers from these studies. Virus-induced histological changes may be obscured by clinical treatments or pre-existing disease. Thus, it may be very difficult to know the full scope of this disease, including the histological lesions, viral cellular tropism and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. On the other hand, although there are better descriptive studies of SARS regarding the pathology induced in the lower respiratory tract, these provided limited benefit for the development of intervention strategies. Therapeutically, corticosteroids were used for the treatment of SARS, producing variable improvement with less fever, reduced inflammatory infiltrates and better oxygenation [99] . More promising results were obtained with the administration of IFNs in SARS patients. In fact, in vitro studies have demonstrated that MERS-CoV is more sensitive to type I IFN than SARS-CoV. Overall, the current available data on MERS-CoV suggest that patients at risk for severe exacerbations after infection are elderly patients or patients who have underlying co-morbid conditions. These patients may not be able to combat the viral infection with type I IFN host responses as efficiently as other patient groups, as aging and co-morbid conditions have been described to have a negative effect on the ability to mount strong type I IFN responses [84, 100] . The sensitivity of MERS-CoV in vitro to type I IFN may indicate that type I IFN can be used as a prophylactic/therapeutic intervention strategy in vivo.",

Severe exacerbations of CoV disease, with lower respiratory tract involvement, seem to occur in the elderly and/or patients with underlying co-morbidities. Possibly, the lack of pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the human population resulted in a higher infection rate in adults and the elderly during the SARS outbreak than normally observed for the other non-SARS human CoVs, leading to a higher morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, viral factors, including those encoded by different accessory viral genes, may play a decisive role in determining pathogenesis.",
