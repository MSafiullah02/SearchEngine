            "text": "SARS-CoV-2, first detected in China's Hubei province late in 2019, rapidly spread from its initial outbreak site to produce a pandemic (Zhou et al., 2020), and has to date been detected in more than 200 countries, where it has infected more than 1.9 million people and caused more than 116,000 deaths (Liu et al., 2020a). However, disease control efforts are hindered by multiple factors, including difficulty in rapidly producing the number diagnostic tests required for such efforts, the apparent limited diagnostic sensitivity of current tests, and the technical expertise required to obtain valid results with them. Large scale testing appears to be essential since estimates indicate that large numbers of mild, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 cases are not detected by current testing efforts (Kobayashi et al., 2020). In the U.S., one estimate suggest that only 1.6% of COVID-19 cases have been detected (Vollmer, 2020), while another study estimates that about 17.9% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic at their first positive test and may not develop symptoms for up to two weeks (Mizumoto et al., 2020). These are alarming statistics, since one estimate suggests that an infected individual may infect 5.6 additional people on average (Steven et al., 2020), and that individuals with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may be as infectious as those with symptomatic cases (Ai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Lu et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020). Ultra-sensitive, inexpensive and high-throughput testing methods are thus required to allow large-scale screening efforts needed allow case identification, isolation, and potential contact tracing of individuals without apparent disease, to improve local containment and to inform regional disease control efforts. Due to limited testing capacity, most countries and regions have prioritized testing for symptomatic and at-risk individuals. However, most symptoms associated with COVID-19, such as fever and cough, are non-specific and do not distinguish COVID-19 cases from individuals with other respiratory infections (Guan et al., 2020).",

Reverse transcription and PCR amplification can be consolidated into a single reaction to allow one-step assays that provide rapid, reproducible and high-throughput results, and this approach is used by the US CDC in its one-step real time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay (CDC, 2020). Standard, quantitative real-time quantitative PCR assays require well-trained personnel and expensive laboratory instruments to obtain accurate and robust results, which can limit their practical application outside well-equipped facilities (Bachman, 2013; Wong and Medrano, 2005). A recently deployed isothermal assays for COVID-19 that uses the Abbott ID Now system requires less expensive equipment and less training, but also produces less definitive results. In this system, signals detected by 5 min and after 15 min indicate positive and negative results, respectively, but signals between these cut-offs are open to interpretation. Reports also indicate that the positive agreement rate of this assay is only 73.9%\u201380.4% (Harrington et al., 2020; Hogan et al., 2020; Smithgall et al., 2020). Thus, qPCR assays are still the gold-standard for COVID-19 diagnosis.",

The COVID-19 CRISPR-FDS we describe is uses a streamlined approach that does not require any special equipment beyond that found in most clinical and research laboratories. CRISPR-FDS employs three closely linked steps: RNA extraction, target amplification, and fluorescent signal detection (Fig. 1\nA). One-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) methods are used to amplify viral cDNA target regions from RNA extracted from nasal swabs, and the resulting amplicons are transferred in their entirety to the gRNA/Cas12a-based CRISPR system for fluorescence detection. Recognition of the target amplicon by the gRNA/Cas12a complex, which is regulated by a target-specific synthetic gRNA, induces the gRNA/Cas12a complex to specifically cleaves the target amplicon and non-specifically cleave a reporter oligo modified with fluorescein and a quencher molecule at each terminus to produce a fluorescent signal. Notably, this method has a 1 h sample to answer time, employs easily obtained reagents and equipment available in most clinical laboratories, can be readily automated to meet a demand for high-throughput testing, and has the potential for use in point-of-care settings if assay results are analyzed with a portable fluorescence reader.",

The assay developed by the Chinese CDC targets sites with ORF1ab and the N gene, while a test from the US CDC targets a site within the N gene, and one developed by the World Health Organization targets a regions within the E gene, each of which contains a potential CRISPR recognition site (Fig. 1B). To permit direct comparison of the results from our proposed CRISPR-FDS approach with those from an establish test in clinical use, we designed primers and gRNAs (Table S1) to target the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N regions analyzed by the Chinese CDC assay (Fig. 1B). Bioinformatic analysis of these primers and gRNAs against common respiratory flora and other viral pathogens revealed that these sequences exhibited strong specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table S2). Sequence alignment of these SARS-CoV-2 target regions with corresponding sites in related beta coronaviruses that cause middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), and human coronavirus (Human-CoV) OC43/HKU1/229E/NL63, detected variable amounts of sequence variation between these species (Fig. 1C). The target region with the N gene exhibited the greatest degree of variation in this analysis, with multiple nucleotide differences detected along the aligned sequences. More differences were detected between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV in this region, in agreement with their phylogenetic distance. However, SARS-CoV still exhibited two or more variations with each N gene primer, while differed at three of four positions of the gRNA protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) required for CAS12a cleavage activity. The SARS-CoV ORF1ab region differed from the matching gRNA at a single position outside its PAM, but both primer regions used to produce the target for this gRNA exhibited at least nucleotide variant, decreasing the likelihood for false positive SARS-CoV recognition events. Analysis of RT-PCR-amplified and RT-RPA-amplified ORF1ab target sequence from a SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive control sample demonstrated that both approaches produced strong signal relative to the background present in their matching negative control samples (Fig. 1D), and this difference was observed for both assay targets (Fig. 1E), and signal detected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV samples did not differ from negative control signal (Fig. 1F).",

            "text": "Since the CRISPR-FDS determines the sensitivity of this assay, we conducted systematic studies of its reaction kinetics to optimize assay performance. CRISPR-mediated photoluminescence (PL) signal progressively increased with input fluorescent reporter substrate concentration, when CRISPR-FPR assays containing a constant amount of target RNA were incubated with increasing amounts of substrate (Fig. 2\nA). Signal-to-noise ratio increased with the ratio of reporter substrate to CRISPR/gRNA complex in this analysis, demonstrating the greatest signal-to-noise ratio at a 1:20 M ratio of Cas12a/gRNA to reporter and plateauing or modestly decreasing at a 1:25 ratio, the highest analyzed in this study. A potential decrease detected at the highest reporter concentration could be due to the background fluorescent signal of un-cleaved reporter. Given the benefits of high signal-to-noise ratio for assay sensitivity, we elected to use the 1:20 ratio for subsequent experiments. The final CRISPR-FDS signal intensity did not differ with temperature in assays incubated at 27 \u00b0C\u201342 \u00b0C, but incubation temperature significantly altered the rate of substrate conversion, with reaction completion times decreasing from 30 min at 27 \u00b0C, to 14 and 12 min at 37 \u00b0C and 42 \u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 2B). CRISPR-FDS reactions can thus be performed at ambient temperature, or at elevated temperature using isothermal water baths or heat blocks, without influencing the final assay outcome. Cas12a/gRNA complex cleavage activity is dependent upon the concentration of amplified target present during the final assay incubation period, so that substrate conversion rates vary with the target amplicon concentration during the assay readout. Significant CRISPR-FDS signal was observed within a 20 min readout period only in assays spiked with 108 copies of the target amplicon, while complete substrate conversion was detected only in samples spiked with \u2265108 copies (Fig. 2C). The observed limit of detection (LOD) of 108 amplicons per CRISPR-FDS readout sample implies this assay should be very tolerant of RT-RPA or RT-PCR pre-amplification efficiency, since single copy cDNAs should be detected when amplification efficiencies are >0.69 (See supplementary information). COVID-19 CRISPR-FDS assays performed with RT-PCR and RT-RPA amplified samples, found that the assay could detect samples spiked with \u22652 copies the target RNA sequence regardless of the method used in the pre-amplification step (Fig. 3\nA and B), in good agreement with our calculated estimate for its LOD. This result compares favorably with the LOD of the qPCR gold-standard method, which was 5 copies/test (Fig. 3C). Signals of complete CRISPR-FDS reactions were also found to be stable for \u22641 h at ambient temperature, reducing the need to read signal quickly when testing large sample batches.",

These results demonstrated good overall agreement with valid and conclusive test results from the state and hospital laboratories that were generated using a CDC-authorized qPCR method (Fig. 3E). These patients were diagnosed based on the results from the state testing laboratory (qPCR 1), considering the poor quality of the hospital laboratories results. CRISPR-FDS exhibited complete concordance with the positive results obtained by the state testing laboratory (100% sensitivity), detected SARS-CoV-2 signal in three samples (1, 5 and 6) that were judged to be negative by the state testing laboratory (71.4% specificity). In the absence of serology data or other information, it is not clear if these three samples represent false positive CRISPR-FDS assay results, or if they represent positive samples that were missed by the qPCR method.

In a study of more than 1,000 patients, 75% COVID-19 suspects had negative qRT-PCR test results but positive chest CT results, and 48% of these patients were considered highly likely to have COVID-19, with an additional 33% considered probable cases (Ai et al., 2020). Notably, we observed a high frequency of invalid or inconclusive test results from samples analyzed in a clinical laboratory, all of which gave valid results when analyzed by RT-PCR in the state testing laboratory or by our CRISPR-FDS assay.",

            "text": "CRISPR applications are both popular in detection assays due to the ability of Cas13 (Gootenberg et al., 2018) and Cas-12a (Chen et al., 2018), respectively, to bind RNA or DNA targets specified by an input gRNA sequence to amplify the detection signal from nucleic acid amplification assays. Various isothermal amplification methods, such as RPA and LAMP, have been reported for the detection of COVID-19 (Ding et al., 2020; Lucia et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), but many problems were found in the detailed analysis of this method, such as low sensitivity and low throughput. Our attempt to replicate results from one of the LAMP studies found that the described N gene and E gene LAMP reactions exhibited strong non-specific amplification, and that it was not possible to distinguish between positive and negative samples, even after titrating the amount input template or varying the reaction time or temperature (Fig. S1). We therefor did not pursue RT-LAMP as a potential means for template amplification in our CRISPR-FDS assay. Further, while we found that RPA worked well, we did not employ it in our final assay, since the necessary reagents are currently available from a single company, limiting its potential for immediate widespread application.",

            "text": "Many CRISPR protocols use paper strips to detect the signal output. This is a good solution for single sample testing since it does not require any equipment to read the results, but its LOD is much lower than fluorescence-based detection methods (Table S3). Our CRISPR-FDS assay can be readily performed in 96-well microtiter plates and read with fluorescent plate readers found in most well-equipped clinical laboratories to allow sensitive and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 detection. Finally, our results indicate that our CRISPR-FDS demonstrates results comparable to those obtained with a CDC-approved qPCR assay in a state testing lab, but produced more valid results than were obtained when the same qPCR assay was employed in a clinical setting. Notably, CRISPR-FDS produced positive results for a fraction of the samples that produced negative results with the qPCR assay, although it was not possible to determine if these results represented false positive CRISPR-FDS results or false negative qPCR results due to the lack of associated follow up data. CRISPR-FDS thus produces sensitive and robust results using readily available equipment and streamlined, high-throughput workflow suitable for use in clinical laboratories, and potentially applicable to point of care settings with the appropriate equipment. One drawback potential drawback to our CRISPR-FDS approach is that is designed to provide clear positive or negative results, but to quantify viral load, as can be determined by qPCR assays using real-time PCR systems. We do not see this as a major drawback given the clear need for rapid, sensitive, and robust assays to diagnose COVID-19.",

However, further efforts need to be made to overcome the current bottleneck in point of care testing to permit self-testing or increase the testing capacity of small clinics that lack the resources to perform current assays. We are currently investigating the potential to integrate the RT-RPA-based CRISPR-FDS onto a microfluidic chip that can be read by a smart phone in attempt to meet this need.",
