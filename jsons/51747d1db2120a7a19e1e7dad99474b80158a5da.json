Sugars are the 36 major carbon and energy sources for living cells, thus transport of sugars across the 37 plasma membrane into the cytoplasm is an essential cell physiological function, which 38 relies on the sugar-specific transport systems involving active and passive mechanisms 39 (Cirillo, 1961; Reinhold & Kaplan, 1984; Chen et al, 2015) . Active transport requires 40 metabolic energy to passage molecules across the plasma membrane in the direction 41 against the concentration gradient, whereas passive transport moves molecules down its 42 concentration without needing an energy input, which can be further classified as 43 facilitated diffusion and free diffusion, respectively. Active transport and facilitated 44 diffusion are dependent on the specific molecular binding between cargo and transporter, 45 thereby exhibiting stereospecificity, transport saturation, and competitive inhibition 46 (Cirillo, 1961) . Moreover, numerous sugars are taken up with concomitant 47 phosphorylation via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase 48 system (PTS), which may cause carbon catabolite repression (CCR), leading to a diauxic 49 cell growth (St\u00fclke & Hillen, 1999) . Fig 1A illustrates the main transporters of glucose, 50 fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and lactose in Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative, 51 facultatively anaerobic bacterium. In contrast, free diffusion is a non-mediated transport 52 with a linear rate in proportion to the concentration difference. However, it is believed 53 that only small, non-polar molecules, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, can freely 54 diffuse through the plasma membrane (Zhao et al, 2011) . Therefore, although many 55 4 sugars are transported passively, no sugars are known to enter cells via a free diffusion 56 manner (Romano, 1986) . 57 The protein translocation channel is a structurally conserved protein-conducting 58 system that allows polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into cell membranes 59 (Osborne et al, 2005; Rapoport, 2007; Mandon et al, 2009 ). In bacteria, this channel is 60 formed by the SecY complex (SecYEG) and is located in the plasma membrane 61 (Brundage et al, 1990; Akimaru et al, 1991; Breyton et al, 2002) . The X-ray crystal 62 structure revealed that the SecY channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow central 63 constriction consisting of six hydrophobic amino acid residues termed the pore ring, and ",

            "text": "When we expressed the SecY with deletion of the plug (SecY (\u0394P)) in an E. coli 89 (\u0394PtsG) lacking the glucose PTS (Plumbridge, 1998) (Fig 2A and B) , the cell growth 90 defect was not observed (Fig 2D and E) . In contrast, the limited growth on glucose 91 caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We 92 reasoned that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma 93 membrane due to its small V A (\u2248 0.178 m 3 /kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D AB \u2248 94 1.009\u00d710 -9 m 2 /s) in water (Appendix Table S1 ), which was confirmed by a [ 14 C]-labelled 95 glucose transport assay (Fig 2C) . With the purpose of further enhancing the glucose 96 uptake, SCVE was co-expressed with the SecY (\u0394P) channel (Fig 2A and B (Fig 3A and B) , and the growth of the strain without ManXYZ on mannose was 122 even faster than the control (Fig 3D and E) , suggesting that the fructose or mannose 123 imported by the SecY (\u0394P) channel already satisfied the cell demand. It should be noted 124 7 that the fructose taken up via the fructose PTS is concomitantly phosphorylated to 125 fructose-1-phosphate before further phosphorylation to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 126 (Kornberg, 2001) (Fig 1A) , but in our route, the phosphorylated fructose first appears 127 inside the cell as fructose-6-phosphate (Fig 1C) , which is in agreement with the route 128 using the transporter of PtsG-F (Kornberg et al, 2000) . The data of growth kinetics in when compared with the wild-type E. coli (Fig 3G and J) , which was also found in the 143 case of mannose ( Fig 3D) . Interestingly, previous work reported that a mutant glucose 144 facilitator protein (2-RD5) from Zymomonas mobilis allowed rapid transport of xylose in 145 E. coli, but in contrast, 2-RD5 caused an extensive growth delay (Ren et al, 2009) . A 146 prolonged lag phase (\u2248 25 h) on arabinose was also observed when we re-expressed 147 8 AraFGH together with SCVE in E. coli (\u0394AraFGH, \u0394AraE) (Fig EV2) , even though 148 AraFGH is regarded as an efficient uptake system for arabinose (Luo et al, 2014) . The 149 use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel did not seem to facilitate the initiation of the arabinose-150 inducible promoter P BAD (Fig EV3) , which controls the synthesis of the key enzymes 151 (AraBAD) involved in the pathway of arabinose metabolism in E. coli (Schleif, 2000) . 152 Therefore, we suspect that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow E. coli to import not only Table S1 ), resulting in a reduced 167 sugar flux through the pore ring of SecY (\u0394P). We thus replaced the isoleucines 168 (molecular weight Mr \u2248 131.18 g/mol) in the pore ring with glycines (Mr \u2248 75.07 g/mol) 169 to amplify the channel open size (Fig 4B) . As illustrated in Fig 4C, Table S1 ). By co-173 expression of SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG) and SCVE, E. coli (\u0394LacY) exhibited a moderate 174 growth on lactose 50 h after cell inoculation (Fig 4A) . 175 The benefits of using the SecY channel mutant for sugar transport 176 Unlike free diffusion which is linear in the concentration difference, the rate of active 177 transport or facilitated diffusion tends to approach saturation as the external sugar content system (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000) . Briefly, PCR product was generated by using 237 primers (Appendix Table S2 ) that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be ",

The SecY plug domain serves as a physical 66 barrier that ensures the channel is sealed in its resting state (Li et al, 2007). During 67 protein translocation, the plug is displaced away from the center of the channel toward 68 the open position by the incoming polypeptide (Tam et al, 2005; Li et al, 2016), and the 69 pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain (Park & Rapoport, 70 2011), preventing the permeation of other molecules. 71 Given the widespread interests in sugar transporters in basic biology research and 72 biotechnology application (Galazka et al, 2010; Luo et al, 2014), as well as the 73 challenges surrounding their broad substrate profiles (Kornberg et al, 2000), these 74 findings prompted us to hypothesize that whether the SecY channel can be designed as a 75 free diffusion passageway for efficient transport of carbohydrates, thus developing an 76 entirely novel paradigm for sugar passage and addressing the problems encountered with 77 the specific transporters. In the present work, we engineered the SecY channel by SecY channel mutants in combination with the SARS (severe acute respiratory 82 syndrome) coronavirus envelope protein (SCVE) and the appropriate sugar kinase (Fig 83 1C), thereby overcoming a bottleneck in engineering bacteria for growth on various 84 sugars, a desirable attribute for biotechnology applications.",

We compared the Monod growth kinetic parameters of the E. coli (\u0394PtsG) co-109 expressing SecY (\u0394P), SCVE and Glk with those of the wild-type strain (Fig 2F).

E. coli with damaged fructose PTS (\u0394FruA) (Ferenci & Kornberg, 1974) or 115 mannose PTS (\u0394ManXYZ) (Erni & Zanolari, 1985) did not grow on fructose (Fig 3A and 116 B) or mannose (Fig 3D and E), respectively. On the other hand, SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE 117 were found to help both mutant strains to recover cell growth, especially for the one 118 grown on mannose. By co-expression of an E. coli fructo(manno)kinase (Mak) which 119 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose or mannose in the cytoplasm (Sproul et al, 120 2001), the strain lacking FruA grew on fructose at a similar rate to that of the wild-type 121 E. coli",

Also, as in the case of glucose, the SecY (\u0394P) 132 channel exhibited a higher half-saturation constant for fructose (K S \u2248 1.579 mM) and 133 mannose (K S \u2248 4.719 mM) than the fructose PTS (K S \u2248 0.843 mM) and the mannose PTS 134 (K S \u2248 3.181 mM), respectively. 135 Functional transport of the non-PTS-dependent pentoses via SecY (\u0394P) channel 136 Next, we tested xylose and arabinose, which are non-PTS-dependent pentoses. The 137 main transporters for xylose (XylFGH) (Sumiya et al, 1995) and arabinose (AraFGH, 138 AraE) (Schleif, 2000) in E. coli were deleted independently, thus the obtained strains 139 either did not grow on xylose (Fig 3G and H) or arabinose (Fig 3J and K) as the sole 140 carbon source.

More 179 seriously, an excessively high sugar gradient across the cell membrane may force the cell 180 to lose water, causing significant growth inhibition. As shown in Fig 5A-C, the specific 181 growth rates of E. coli at 50, 100, and 150 g/L of glucose were 0.137, 0.127, and 0.026 h -182 1 , while the rates of the E. coli (\u0394PtsG) with SecY (\u0394P), SCVE and Glk were 0.175, 183 0.228, and 0.184 h -1 , respectively. It indicates that use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel was able 184 to improve the cell growth at high sugar levels. Similarly, Clostridium acetobutylicum, a 185 Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium, was found to grow faster when the SecY (\u0394P) 186 channel was employed for xylose transport rather than using the native XylT at 70 g/L of 187 xylose (Fig 5D). The specific growth rate increased by over 18%, from 0.364 h -1 to 0.431 188 h -1 . Moreover, Fig 5E and F suggest that the SecY (\u0394P) channel was able to reduce the 189 competitive inhibition caused by the glucose analogs, methyl-\u03b1-D-glucoside (\u03b1-MG) and 190 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), on transport of glucose in E. coli. Thereafter, simultaneous 191 utilization of mixed monosaccharides by the channel-engineered E. coli was tested. As 192 expected, the wild-type E. coli exhibited CCR when grown in the presence of glucose and 193 10 xylose (Fig 5G). Intensive efforts have revealed that the PTS of the preferred carbon 194 source plays a major role in CCR regulations (Deutscher et al, 2006; G\u00f6rke & St\u00fclke, 195 2008). However, deletion of the glucose PTS may lead to a reduced glucose uptake (Kim 196 et al, 2015) (Fig 5H). Our results show that replacing the glucose PTS with SecY (\u0394P), 197 SCVE and Glk in E. coli enabled the cells to simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose 198 (Fig 5I), overcoming the CCR phenomenon, and the consumption rates of both sugars 199 were accelerated as compared to the non-channel-engineered E. coli (\u0394PtsG)used in this study were E. coli Top10 and E. coli BL21 (DE3), which have 205 the genotypes: F -mcrA \u0394(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) \u03c680 lacZ\u0394M15 \u0394lacX74 recA1 206 ara\u0394139 \u0394(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL(Str R ) endA1 nupG, and F -ompT hsdS(r dcm (DE3), respectively.

The E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pKD46 was grown gene in the gene-knockout mutant was eliminated by using pCP20,244    which encodes the FLP recombinase at 30 o C and is lost at 42 o C. Disruption of xylT 245 (GenBank AAK79313.1) in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 55025 was performed with a group 246 II intron-based targetron technology as described previously(Shao et al, 2007). Briefly,247    the 350 bp targetron fragment for xylT gene was amplified by using the primers shown in248    AppendixTable S2and pSY6 as a template. The PCR product was then digested and 249 ligated to pSY6, yielding pSY6-xylT which was methylated in E. coli ER2275 (pAN1)Mermelstein & Papoutsakis, 1993) and electroporated into C. acetobutylicum ATCC251 55025. The strain C. acetobutylicum (\u0394XylT) was selected on CGM plates supplemented 252 with 50 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin at 37 o C, and the erythromycin resistance was then lost on 253 CGM plates without any antibiotics. 254 Cloning, mutation, and plasmid construction 255 sCVE (GenBank AAP73416.1) was codon optimized and synthesized by Inovogen 256 Tech. Co. (Beijing, China). The sequence is listed below (5'\u21923'of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE 265 E. coli was inoculated in LB containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL 266 kanamycin. After cells were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.5 (EU-2600 UV-visible 267 spectrophotometer, Onlab, China) at 37 o C, protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM 268 Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25 o C for 12 h. The induced E. coli 269 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 \u00d7 g and washed two times with 270 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Cells were then resuspended in PBS at 15:1 and 271 disrupted by sonication (JY92-IIN ultrasonic homogenizer, Scientz, China) on ice. 272 Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000 \u00d7 g, and the cell-free 273 extract was then centrifuged at 210,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h using Optima L-80 XP Ultracentrifuge Beckman, USA). The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 0.01 mM MgCl 2 and 2 % 275 (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to solubilize the plasma 276 membrane, and the outer-membrane fraction was then repelleted by ultracentrifugation 277 (Fan et al, 2011). The fluorescence of the obtained plasma/outer-membrane fraction was 278 measured with F-320 fluorescence spectrometer (Gangdong, China) at \u03bb Ex = 395 nm. 279 [ 14 C]-labelled glucose transport assay 280 The [ 14 C]-labelled glucose (5.5 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American 281 Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

They were then resuspended in PBS, and the fluorescence 298 intensity of the cells was measured by using FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson, USA).299 2-NBDG transport assay 300 2-NBDG was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (USA). E. coli strains were 301 inoculated in LB containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin, and were 302 induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at 25 o C for 12 h. After harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 303 \u00d7 g and washed twice with PBS, cells were resuspended in PBS. Reaction was started by 304 addition of 2-NBDG to 10 \u03bcM at room temperature, and samples were taken at 5 min and 305 centrifuged at 5,000 \u00d7 g to remove cells. The fluorescence of supernant was measured by 306 using F-320 fluorescence spectrometer (Gangdong, China) at \u03bb Ex = 475 nm and \u03bb Em = 550 307 nm (Yoshioka et al, 1996). 308 Fermentation 309 E. coli strains were pre-cultured in LB containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 100 310 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin at 37 o C over night, and then cells were sub-inoculated into M9 311 medium supplemented with the same antibiotics, 0.4 mM IPTG, and sole sugar as carbon 312 source. In mixed-sugar fermentation, the carbon sources were glucose and xylose. The 313 cell density (A 600 nm ) in sole-sugar fermentation was determined by using Multiskan 314 Spectrum (Thermo Scientific, USA), while in mixed-sugar fermentation, it was analyzed 315 via EU-2600 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Onlab, China). Sugars were measured by 316 Dionex U300 HPLC (Dionex, USA) equipped with Aminex HPX-87H Column (Bio-Rad, 317 USA), for which 5 mmol/L H 2 SO 4 was used as the mobile phase.
