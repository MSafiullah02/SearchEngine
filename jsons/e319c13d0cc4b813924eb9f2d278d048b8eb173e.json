In this study, we discovered that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin, two FDA-approved drugs for treatment of human diseases, had significant antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, with EC50 values for the reduction of viral RNA at nanomolar concentrations. Both drugs completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at lower drug concentrations than that of remdesivir. The selection indices of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin are 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting wide safety margins. Both drugs were able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as suppress established SARS-CoV-2 infection. The compounds share a porphyrin ring structure. Molecular docking indicates that the compounds may interact with viral receptor ACE2 and could block the cell-cell fusion mediated by ACE2 and viral S protein. Our finding suggests that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin might be potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and also sheds new light on the development of a novel class of small compounds against SARS-CoV-2.",

An earlier case report demonstrated the potential effectiveness of remdesivir in the experimental treatment of an American COVID-19 patient 1 . In vitro experiment showed that remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication 2 . The recent data on the compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 indicated that clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) 3 . Several drugs in clinical use for other diseases have been tested in vitro for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and some of them are in clinical trial [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Among them, chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have drawn intensive debate 9 . Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 10 while the clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine reported controversial results 11, 12 . Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has also been extensively used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China though the direct antiviral effect of TCM awaits investigation.",

The results indicate that protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin may block the cell-cell fusion mediated by the interaction of ACE2 and viral S protein.DISCUSSIONProtoporphyrin IX and verteporfin have been approved and used in the treatment of human diseases. Protoporphyrin IX is the final intermediate in the protoporphyrin IX iron complex (heme) biosynthetic pathway16 . Heme is an important cofactor for oxygen transfer and oxygen storage17 and is a constituent of hemoproteins which play a variety of roles in cellular metabolism18 . The light-activable photodynamic effect of protoporphyrin IX was used for cancer diagnosis19 and approved by FDA for treatment of bronchial and esophageal cancers and early malignant lesions of the skin, bladder, breast, stomach, and oral cavity20,21 . Verteporfin was approved for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration22 . The potential of verteporfin for the treatment of cancers, such as prostatic cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been investigated23 . Verteporfin also has been reported to inhibit autophagy at an early stage by suppressing autophagosome formation24 . Our study discovered potent antiviral effects of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effective concentrations of these drugs are in the nanomolar concentration range. In addition, the selection indices of both drugs are greater than 200, indicating better safety margins. Nevertheless, this study was performed with Vero-E6 cell culture system. The antiviral efficacy of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin in vivo will need clinical evaluation.Both protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin have a porphyrin ring structure formed by four pyrrole rings. It can be deduced that they share a similar mechanism of antiviral action. In the experiment when either drug was added prior to viral infection, viral RNA production was inhibited even if the relevant drug was not added in the later virus infection and post-infection stages (group IV inFig. 2b, 2c). Furthermore, increasing viral titer did not relieve the inhibition of the drugs added before viral infection(Fig. 3b). A logical hypothesis is that both drugs act by inhibiting an early step in viral infection. Structural simulation by molecular docking supports the binding of both drugs to viral receptor ACE2. Several residues on ACE2 predicted to interact with the drugs are very close to the key residues that interact with the RBD of viral S protein. Based on the molecular docking and experimental data, both drugs are likely to bind ACE2, which might interfere with the interaction between ACE2 and the RBD and impairs viral entry. The mechanism was also supported by the blocking effect of both drugs on the cell-cell fusion mediated by the interaction of ACE2 and viral S protein. More detailed mechanism warrants further study. The study suggests a new venue for the development small molecule-based entry inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2.",
