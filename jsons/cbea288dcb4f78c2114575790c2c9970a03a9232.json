This method is based on the refinement reasoning which consists in adding more details step by step from the abstraction. Modeling critical systems in Event-B requires several steps of refinement in order to take into account all the details of the specification. Therefore, the whole system modeling and proof become more difficult because of the huge size of data and system properties like safety properties described in the system specification.",

As part of this project, the goal of our thesis 1 is to answer the industrial need, i.e. find a solution to the models voluminosity issue in Event-B when we put the whole specification in the model progressively by the refinement mechanism. This conduces to: study what exists in the literature; apply these approaches on a railway case study, analyze the results and identify their limitations. Based on these identified limitations, we propose a new approach of decomposition called the decomposition by refinement.",

The shared variable decomposition [4] , A-style, consists in distributing events of a system in several sub-systems. This approach proposes to manage shared variables between several events in different sub-systems. It is also used for decomposing parallel programs [6] . The shared event decomposition [5] , B-style, is based on the variables partition in each sub-system. Each sub-system contains the chosen variables, and the shared events between the resulting subsystems are defined in two different signatures for each sub-system. In addition to these two approaches, one finds others such as generic instantiation [4] , modularization [7] , fragmentation and distribution [10] .",

As for the shared events decomposition, the distribution of the variables is not always possible because of complex actions involving partitioned variables in different sub-systems or complex predicates (invariants and guards). This requires the separation of these variables by several steps of refinements with mathematical proofs. The detailed description of the state of the art, the application on a railway case study, the analysis and the identified limitations have been presented in [8] .",

The approach consists in the decomposition using the refinement technique for the purpose of keeping the semantic link between the system and the resulting sub-systems. So, a system is decomposed into one or more sub-systems in such a way they are refining this later. This can be applied to a system either in the abstraction level or in a certain level of refinement as shown in Fig. 1 . By this way the sub-systems are still preserving the defined system properties in the abstraction through the refinement. Also, we define a new link between the sub-systems named REFSEES. This link will provide to each sub-system the visibility to the other sub-systems: the state of the private variables, the corresponding invariants, the constants, the sets and the properties.",

[2] , we can demonstrate that the theoretical re-composition/combination of the subsystems is a refinement of the system M . Rule 5 : For each sub-system, a variant proof obligation rule VAR should be defined because a transition should not be triggered indefinitely. As for the deadlock freedom rules, there are two types: the weak deadlock freedom rule DLF w and the strong one DLF s . DLF w verifies that at least one of the events is triggered. Whereas DLF s proves that each event is triggered at least one time. This verification should also be done in case of the definition of new events.",

The realized analysis and the study conduce to the identification of some limitations of those approaches regarding the industrial need. So, we propose a new approach: the decomposition by refinement based on decomposing a system by the refinement technique into several sub-systems. A new clause REFSEES is defined to link the sub-systems to each other which allows the visibility of the state variables. This approach will ensure the preservation of invariants through the refinement technique. Currently, we are working on the definition of the strategy to follow for the application of the approach. This strategy will define: the way to decompose the state variables of the system and its events, and how to define, in each sub-system, new invariants, new state variables and new events. As a short-term perspective, we will demonstrate that the fact of combining -theoretically-the sub-systems constitutes a one refining component of the initial system regarding the theoretical definition of the refinement in B method. As a long-term perspective, new proof obligations will be specified, through the new defined link, to ensure the behavior preservation in each of the resulting sub-systems. for the purpose of its scaling up, the approach will be applied to a railway signaling system case study.",

But, these variables should all be present at least in one of the sub-systems. Rule 2 : The sub-system M a (resp. M b ) can refer in the guards of their events to the private variables of M b (resp. M a ). Rule 3 : The transition system of the resulting sub-systems M a and M b should correspond to one transition system of the behavior of M . Rule 4 : M a and M b transitions are not synchronized contrary to the decomposition by shared events. So, following what has been presented in",
