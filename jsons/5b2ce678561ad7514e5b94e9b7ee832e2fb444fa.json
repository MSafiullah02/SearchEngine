            "text": "An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as 'an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy'. 1 The word exacerbation has a Latin root; stemming from the verb exacerbare meaning 'to provoke to anger' and the Oxford English Dictionary defines an exacerbation as 'the process of making a problem, bad situation, or negative feeling worse'. 2 This accurately reflects the negative impact COPD exacerbations (ECOPD) have on patient quality of life, 3 lung function decline 4 and mortality. 5 In the UK, national audit data highlight the high mortality and readmission rates (and thus healthcare costs) associated with ECOPD. 6 Exacerbations impact on patients' quality of life 3 and even a single exacerbation is associated with an increase in mean annual forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) decline. 7 The early identification, provision of appropriate treatment and subsequent prevention (or ideally, primary prevention) of exacerbations has to be a central strategy for COPD care. We use clinical symptoms to diagnose an exacerbation of COPD, based on the triad of increased breathlessness, increased sputum volume and/ or increased sputum purulence. These criteria are essentially unchanged over the last 180 years, 8 finessed with clinical investigations such as a chest radiograph, arterial blood gas, ECG, a full blood count and sputum culture (all available since 1872-1924). [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In stark terms, our diagnostic approach to COPD exacerbations has not fundamentally changed for almost 100 years. We have no COPD-specific biomarkers and the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. This is in contrast to many other acute presentations of chronic diseases, such as a myocardial infarction (MI) in ischaemic heart disease, where specific and sensitive diagnostic toolkits including biomarkers, imaging and interventions have revolutionised care pathways and patient outcomes. Such disparity in advancement raises the question of why COPD is so far behind other common, debilitating and progressive chronic diseases which are associated with acute flares of symptoms. Why do we not have a better diagnostic and treatment toolkit for ECOPD? Perhaps to move forward, we need to examine the past.",

Viruses were found in 48%, with rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses most commonly identified, again in descending order of prevalence. 16 Viral infections are important in COPD, associated with frequent exacerbations, a higher total symptom burden at presentation and a longer period before symptom recovery, 17 perhaps reflecting the lack of specific therapies available. Coinfection (bacterial and viral) is common (seen in 25% of severe exacerbations), associated with increased lung and systemic inflammation, longer hospitalisation and more severe lung disease. 16 The role of air quality is of increasing interest. Short-term exposure to major air pollutants (trioxygen (O 3 ), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5 ) is associated with respiratory risk but a recent systematic review concluded that these pollutants were also associated with risk of exacerbation. 18 Other identified triggers and/or risk factors for exacerbation include discontinuation and poor adherence with medications, 19 poor nutritional and lower socioeconomic status 20 and dynamic hyperinflation. 21 These causative triggers and predisposing factors have been consistently identified across the literature, but studies also highlight alternative pathologies which might account for symptoms, including thromboembolic disease and MI (identified in 16% 22 and 8% 23 of suspected COPD exacerbations, respectively), suggesting comorbidity is important.",

However, there are concerns about the ability of patients to self-report sputum colour without training or a colour chart to refer to Daniels et al 25 and in some studies, sputum colour could not differentiate between a viral or bacterial aetiology. 16 A landmark study in 2011 26 suggested that exacerbations could be stratified using inflammatory profile. Here, 55% of exacerbations were associated with bacteria, 29% with a virus, most commonly rhinovirus, 28% with a significant sputum eosinophilia and 14% with no significant inflammation (termed pauci-inflammatory). Of note, these groupings did not reflect differences in symptom burden, clinical presentation or sputum colour, which could not differentiate between causes, 26 meaning clinicians could not predict what the cause or inflammatory profile of the exacerbation was using standard clinical evaluation alone. This has important but perhaps predictable implications for clinical practice. Moving forward, as with other acute presentations of chronic disease, we should not rely on clinical symptoms, signs or non-specific investigations to direct a stratified approach to exacerbation treatment. Given COPD is an inflammatory disease, the immune response may provide aetiological insight.",

For example, activated neutrophils release proteinases during migration through complex tissues, degranulation, frustrated Where local host defences are overwhelmed, non-resident immune cells, predominantly neutrophils, but also T cells, B-cells and eosinophils are recruited into the lung tissue, following chemokines secreted by epithelial and endothelial cells and resident immune cells.

Neutrophilic inflammation is corticosteroid resistant in COPD but promisingly, studies have identified potential therapeutic targets to improve impaired cellular functions.

Of note, a recent Cochrane review concluded that there was no evidence of benefit from self-management interventions (including rescue packs) to reduce all-cause hospital admission, all-cause hospitalisation days, emergency department visits, general practitioner visits, dyspnoea scores, the number of COPD exacerbations or all-cause mortality 54 although more research was needed. However, the provision of a rescue pack for patients with exacerbations remains a recommendation from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the revised guideline published in December 2018 (based on expert opinion). 55 These studies begin to highlight that there are different types of COPD exacerbations, with different responses to treatment and that a 'one size fits all' approach for both treatment and prevention is overly simplistic.

One such study included 90 exacerbating patients (unselected, of any aetiology), assessing 36 preselected inflammatory mediators. Of these, CRP, interleukin-6, myeloid-progenitor inhibitory factor 1, pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine, adiponectin and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 were significantly elevated at the exacerbation event. However, no plasma mediator alone provided a robust predictive tool for diagnosing an exacerbation event. CRP combined with a major symptom (dyspnoea, sputum purulence or sputum volume) improved diagnostic accuracy but no mediator/symptom combination predicted clinical severity or recovery. 60 This result may reflect that the study included 'all comers' with an exacerbation (all aetiologies) and therefore might have been underpowered to find predictive biomarkers if the biomarkers varied by aetiology or host response. To address this, further studies utilised differing approaches to identify phenotypes of exacerbations.",

In the first study of its kind, the BEAT-COPD study employed cluster analysis using mediators sampled from the airways to determine biologically distinct exacerbation groups. 62 Four biological exacerbation phenotypes were described, mapping on to inflammation, independent of each other but clinically indistinguishable. Sputum interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) was found to be most sensitive for bacteria-associated exacerbations (proinflammatory cluster, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) 0.89), serum CXCL10 was (again) most sensitive for virus-associated exacerbations (Th1 cluster, ROC 0.76) and peripheral blood eosinophils (Th2 cluster, ROC 0.85) was the most sensitive for sputum eosinophilic-associated exacerbations. An independent validation cohort of 89 subjects confirmed that sputum IL1\u03b2, serum CXCL10 and peripheral blood eosinophils These studies highlight four potential exacerbation phenotypes which might provide robust treatment pathways in time. 1. Bacterial in origin, IL-1\u03b2 as a biomarker, neutrophilic inflammation. 2. Viral in origin, with CXCL10 as a biomarker. 3. Eosinophillic in origin and as a biomarker. 4 Pauci-inflammatory. These appear to be biologically different even when clinically indistinguishable. However, while our understanding of each of these phenotypes needs to be improved, we understand very little at all about the so-called pauci-inflammatory exacerbation. Indeed, it is unclear whether this represents COPD at all or the acute presentation of a related comorbidity which may also cause or exacerbate breathlessness and a cough.",

Whether the presence of comorbidities is based on self-report 63 or systematically sought, 64 they are common and affect mortality. 65 Exacerbations represent a period with multiple insults to both the lung and systemically. Such insults include the aetiological factor itself (pathogen or environmental), lung physiological changes and additional work of breathing, hypoxia, periods of inactivity (which can effectively be prolonged periods of 'bed rest' during an in-patient admission), with a study suggesting that an acute medical admission is associated with a median step count of 626 per day (IQR 266-1403), 66 dehydration, malnutrition, the therapies prescribed and their side effects (eg, oral corticosteroids and hyperglycaemia and antibiotics and gastrointestinal disturbance) and then the sequelae of these factors including systemic inflammation, hypo and hypernatraemia/kalaemia and altered sympathetic drive. Figure 3 summarises the complex relationships between comorbidity and exacerbations in COPD. There is a significant and complex interplay between the exacerbation and the comorbid condition including the impact of comorbidities on the exacerbation itself; how an exacerbation contributes to comorbid disease; the prognostic role of comorbid disease and the subclinical presentation of a comorbid condition at the time of an exacerbation. Cardiovascular disease highlights the interplay and is the most studied comorbidity in this context.",

Coexistent ischaemic heart disease leads to far greater number of symptomdays per year, 68 while an increased blood glucose in hospitalised patients leads to a longer stay and is associated with a higher risk of death. 69 MI is more likely in the period following presentation with an exacerbation [70] [71] [72] and there is evidence of increase platelet aggregation, increased arterial stiffness as well as myocardial injury as evidenced by cardiac biomarkers at the time of a COPD exacerbation. 73 74 The fact that comorbid disease may present subclinically at the time of the exacerbation is also important to consider, be it as a differential or as a further contributing factor to the symptoms and challenges of managing the condition. In a prospective case series, one in 12 patients presenting to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD had criteria that would meet diagnosis of a MI. 23 Impaired cognitive function is evident, if assessed, in a large proportion of patients at the time of discharge from a hospitalised exacerbation, with no evidence of recovery 3 months later. 75 Prognostically, comorbidities present a greater risk of hospitalisation, 76 particularly in the presence of lower lung function, as well as increased all-cause readmissions related to multimorbidity and older age. 77 In the ECLIPSE study (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points), the best predictor of exacerbations was a former history of them. In addition, however, a history of reflux and heartburn was a further independent factor. 78 The presence of acute kidney injury 79 and lower limb muscle cross-sectional area at the time of exacerbation requiring hospitalisation are both prognostic of death. 80 The prognostic COPD exacerbation score such as the validated DECAF score 81 (\"Dyspnoea, Eosinopenia, Consilidation, Acidaemia and atrial Fibrillation\" score predicting in-patient mortality) and the PEARL score (\"Previous admissions, eMRCD score, Age, Right-sided heart failure and Left sided heart failure\" score predicting 90-day readmission and mortality) 82 include cardiac comorbidity in their calculations. Patients deemed as frequent exacerbators are more likely to be depressed 83 84 or have coexistent cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis. 84 It is unclear if some events labelled exacerbations are actually a presentation of a comorbid condition (and studies suggest that clinicians are less likely to diagnose MI or Pulmonary Embolus (PE) if there is a concomitant diagnosis of COPD, 85 86 ) perhaps the so-called pauci-inflammatory exacerbations, or whether the comorbidity is exacerbating the COPD.",

There has been no new intervention to treat COPD exacerbations since the widespread adoption of non-invasive ventilation to treat exacerbations with hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the early 1990s. From the first introduction of guidelines such as GOLD in 1997, the therapy for an exacerbation is unchanged. As described below, despite being commonly used, there remain significant research knowledge gaps in determining which exacerbations do and do not require treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids.",

Despite evidence in the late 1980s that many hospitalised patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids, 90 it was only at the turn of the millennium that small randomised clinical trails (RCTs) first documented clinical efficacy, suggesting benefit on lung function and outcomes such as length of hospital stay. 91 Around the same time, the first small outpatient trials of steroids at exacerbation reported, 92 with modest benefits confirmed in a larger 2003 RCT. 93 Later it was defined that short course (5 days) treatment was as effective as longer 14 day courses, and without the need to taper dose. 94 With a greater emphasis on exacerbation phenotyping, more recent studies have documented the ability to safely withhold steroids in exacerbations without an eosinophil signal. 49 However, the practicality of achieving this at point-ofcare, and the optimal blood eosinophil cut-off to guide steroid therapy remain to be determined, and there are ongoing trials in the area. Given the toxicity associated with repeated courses of corticosteroids, the need for effective novel anti-inflammatory agents is also great. Disappointingly, there is no evidence of benefit with the anti-TNF agent entanercept 95 or roflumilast, 96 for example. Anthonisen's 1987 RCT demonstrated the superiority of antibiotics over placebo in exacerbations presenting with at least two of the three cardinal symptoms of increased breathlessness, sputum volume and sputum purulence. 97 Importantly, this had been conducted in patients with COPD, rather than just those with chronic bronchitis. However, the placebo response rate was high, likely reflecting viral pathogens as a common cause of exacerbation, and more recent studies have not shown a benefit of antibiotics in other outcomes such as prolonging the time to next exacerbation. 98 Biomarkers such as sputum colour and procalcitonin 99 have been suggested as strategies to better guide antibiotic therapy, but there remains unmet need to better define which exacerbations do and do not benefit from antibiotic therapy. It is also notable that there are no effective interventions to treat (or prevent) rhinovirus infections, thought to be the single the most common cause of a COPD exacerbation.",

Changes in lung function are not patient centred, and changes in symptoms scores not validated. 'Clinical recovery' and 'treatment failure' are subjective constructs, while studies have also examined effects of exacerbation treatment on the time to the next event given that exacerbations cluster in time, with a high-risk period for a second event in the period following recovery from a first. 102 We have at least made progress in prevention of exacerbations, though even when used optimally there seems to be a ceiling of reduction at around 25%. Effective interventions (outlined in table 1), alone and in combination, include non-pharmacological approaches such as pulmonary rehabilitation, and pharmacological approaches the mainstay of which remains long-acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids and, in selected cases, prophylactic antibiotics. For patients remaining hypercapnic following a hospitalised exacerbation, domiciliary non-invasive ventilation significantly reduces the risk of rehospitalisation (with an absolute risk reduction of 17% in a recent landmark study). 103 Similar to strategies to better target exacerbation treatment, there is also now emerging evidence on how better to target exacerbation prevention interventions, including the optimal use of inhaled corticosteroids. Thus, while exacerbation prevention strategies are incompletely effective, the challenge here is rather selecting the right combination of interventions for the right patient at the right time, rather than the absence of effective prevention strategies.",

The concept of 'treatable traits' has gained considerable momentum in stable COPD, 42 and perhaps now the same concept should be tested further in exacerbations. We are beginning to see some differences in biological signals across exacerbation aetiologies and host responses. To build on this, we need to continue with more stratified studies of ECOPD, learning from the fruitful experience of focusing on those with an eosinophilic signal, but this time using POC testing to characterise and test treatments in (eg) viral or pauci-inflammatory exacerbations.
