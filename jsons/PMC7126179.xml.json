            "text": "Vaccination continues to be one of the most important disease management tools for controlling infectious diseases in both livestock and humans. Indeed, with increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and the continued paucity of antiviral drugs against many viruses, vaccination is the most attractive approach to infectious disease control. Although vaccination has been practised for over 200 years and there are many licensed vaccines used today, recent advances in molecular biology and immunology combined with our understanding of the pathogenesis of many infectious agents, stimulated renewed interest in developing safer and more efficacious vaccines. This is evident by the increased number of articles directly focusing on vaccines and the genesis of new journals dedicated specifically to vaccinology. These activities are focused on both improving conventional vaccines and their delivery to meet the needs of today\u2019s management systems as well as developing totally new approaches to vaccination.",

All of these novel approaches require a much more detailed characterization of the genetic organization of the pathogen and the genes responsible for virulence or induction of immunity. As a result of this increased knowledge and ability to manipulate the genomes of pathogens, we are in an unprecedented position to develop better live vectored vaccines that are not only safer, but are also able to induce a wide range of protective immune responses ranging from humoral to cellular immunity, as well as systemic and mucosal immunity. The generation of mucosal immunity is especially important if we hope to prevent infection. Although rarely will a vaccine induce sterile immunity, mucosal immunity should limit replication of the pathogen at the site of entry. Mucosal immunity reduces the rate of infection and the rate of replication by either: (1) preventing attachment of the pathogen to host cells; (2) interfering with transcription or proper assembly of the pathogen intracellularly; or (3) enhancing antigen uptake and clearance of the pathogen as well as improving presentation of the antigen to the immune system for increased immune responsiveness.",

These microparticles are generally biodegradable and can even be used for pulsatile release. Both polylactide\u2013glycolide, and alginate particles have been shown to be effective, especially for oral delivery (McDermott et al., 1998, Bowersock et al., 1999); (3) DNA vaccines (Cox et al., 1993, Donnelly et al., 1993, Yokonama et al., 1995, Lewis et al., 1997); (4) transgenic plants (Arakawa et al., 1998); and (5) live vectors (Pastoret et al., 1988, Yilma et al., 1988). Live vectors are attractive because they can be engineered in such a way as to not only induce immunity to the vector, but if they are engineered correctly, they can induce immunity to an array of proteins encoded for by genes inserted into the vector. Indeed, one of the first licensed recombinant vaccines employed in vaccinology included vaccinia virus carrying the gene encoding rabies virus glycoproteins. This vaccine is presently licensed for immunization of wildlife against rabies. Not only has this vaccine reduced the spread of rabies virus in wildlife populations, but also reduced the spill-over of virus infection from wildlife to domestic animals and humans (Pastoret et al., 1988, Brochier and Pastoret, 1993, Mackowiak et al., 1999). Since the initial licensing of vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinants, numerous other live viral and bacterial vectors have been investigated as potential vaccine vectors (Kit et al., 1992, Cirillo et al., 1995, Sheppard, 1999). The present review will summarize the progress that has been made in using adenoviruses as potential vectors for induction of immunity in animals.",

Since there are such a variety of different adenoviruses, it is not surprising that they can induce a variety of different diseases in their specific hosts. However, if one was to generalize, most of these pathogens enter via mucosal surfaces and, therefore, replicate, at least initially, in mucosal sites of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. It is for this reason that adenoviruses are attractive as vectors for delivering vaccines to mucosal surfaces. Other important features of adenoviruses as vectors is that certain serotypes are often associated with only mild clinical diseases, the molecular biology and replication strategies of adenoviruses are well characterized, they replicate to extremely high titres (1010\u20131011 pfu ml\u22121), thereby reducing the cost of vaccine production and delivery and most recently, the cloning of the entire genome into a bacterial plasmid provides for rapid construction and isolation of recombinants (Chartier et al., 1996). Finally, a number of effective adenovirus vaccines have already been licensed for use in animals and humans, thereby, providing experience with adenovirus vaccines, both with regards to safety and efficacy. All these factors are critical for successful development of live vectored vaccines.",

The genome is packaged in a naked icosahedral capsid. Since naked viruses are generally more stable in the environment than are enveloped viruses, this is another attractive feature with regards to using adenoviruses as vectors for vaccines. Since the icosahedral capsid is rigid, the amount of DNA that can be packaged inside the capsid is strictly controlled by space limitations. In the case of human adenoviruses, it has been demonstrated that \u223c105% of the genome size can be effectively packaged (Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 1987). Since the addition of 5% of the genome does not provide much space for insertion of new genes, most recombinant adenovirus vaccines are developed by replacing existing viral sequences with genes of interest. Depending on the specific sequence replaced, the recombinant viruses can either be replication\u2013competent or replication\u2013defective.",

This helps to increase the cloning capacity of the vector, thus, allowing to insert large foreign DNA. In addition, it has the potential to remove any adenovirus gene sequences whose expression may have harmful effects on the desired application of the recombinant vector. Since a helper virus has to be used to propagate the desired gutless vector, one of the main problems associated with the production of such vectors is the final separation of helper and vector viruses during purification. However, constant improvements/modifications in the production of \u2018gutless\u2019 vectors has helped to obtain purified vectors which contain 0.1% helper virus (Parks et al., 1996).",

This requires a thorough understanding of the replication strategy of the virus and the specific genes involved in these replication steps. Adenovirus genome replication is generally divided into two distinct chronological events. The early events, which can occur prior to replication of the viral genome, are controlled by the early regions (E). In contrast, the late events occur during or after viral genome replication begins and are primarily concerned with the production of most of the viral structural proteins and are turned late region genes (L).",

The E1 region polypeptides are the first to be expressed following infection of a cell with the virus and are important regulators of the transcription of viral and cellular genes. Since the gene products from the E1 region are critical for initiation of virus replication, deletion of these genes results in a replication-defective virus. However, it is still possible to use viruses deleted in the E1 region as vectors by providing the E1 gene products in a complementing cell line. These gene products must be expressed at sufficient levels to complement the E1 defective virus. Although the virus can be produced in these cell lines, once it is introduced into an animal, which does not produce these gene products, the virus infection results in an abortive infection (Graham and Prevec, 1992, Grunhaus and Horwitz, 1992). These replication-defective viruses can still express the inserted gene of interest and induce an immune response in animals, but since they are replication-defective, they are considered to be safe with little chance of environmental spread. Since these replication-defective viruses have a built-in suicide mechanism for biological control of the spread of the vector, it makes them attractive with regulatory agencies and environmentalists. Although the E1 deleted virus may pick up the E1 region from the transfected cell to produce replication competent viruses the chances of this occurring are remote since we use an E1 from human adenovirus rather than bovine adenovirus to transfect the cells.",

This region is not required for virus replication in vitro and, therefore, replacement of the E3 region with foreign genes does not result in a replication-defective virus. Even though this region is not essential for virus replication in vitro, its conservation in all adenoviruses studied to-date suggests that the virus has retained this region for a purpose. Studies primarily in human serotype 5 have shown that different proteins produced by the E3 region are involved in binding the MHC Class 1 molecules, in modulating lysis by tumor necrosis factor, and down-regulating epidermal growth factor receptors on host cells (Paabo et al., 1986, Gooding et al., 1988, Krajcsi et al., 1992). As a result, deletion of the E3 region may modulate the pathogenesis of E3-deleted viruses (Morin et al., 1987, Ginsberg et al., 1989). Our studies with E3-deleted bovine adenoviruses did not show any evidence of increased lymphocyte infiltration or pathogenesis so that increased pathogenesis seen with human adenovirus E3-deleted mutants may not be universal (Mittal et al., 1995b). However, before any E3-deleted mutants from any adenovirus are commercialized, it will be important to investigate the impact of E3-deleted viruses on viral pathogenesis.",

The four gene products are involved in transition of the virus from early-to-late gene expression and shut-off of host cell gene expression, virus replication and assembly. In human adenoviruses, the E4 region is essential and E4-deleted viruses will only replicate in cells expressing E4 gene products. Whether E4 is essential in all adenoviruses has not yet been determined, but one would assume that it is. Therefore, as with E1-deleted viruses, cell lines expressing E4 will need to be developed before one can establish an E4-deleted recombinant virus. If one expects to develop an E1, E3, and E4-deleted virus, one will require a cell line expressing both E1 and E4 gene products at sufficient levels to complement the gene-deleted viruses, but not at such a level that these genes would be toxic to the cells. Thus, in addition to manipulating the virus, it is critical to develop the appropriate cell lines for expression of these viruses.",

These include bovine adenoviruses, porcine adenoviruses, ovine adenoviruses, fowl adenoviruses, and canine adenoviruses (Mittal et al., 1995a, Klonjkowski et al., 1997, Xu et al., 1997, Sheppard et al., 1998, Reddy et al., 1999). Experience with these animal adenoviruses has clearly demonstrated commonality between all the adenoviruses studied to-date, but also demonstrates some very significant differences. Thus, one cannot directly translate the experiences with one adenovirus to another. For example, the genomic organization of most adenoviruses is similar but not identical. Even with this similarity in genomic organization, the transfection efficiency between human and animal adenoviruses may vary by one or two orders of magnitude. It was this low transfection efficiency that has hampered development of some of the animal adenoviruses as vectors. Unfortunately, the reasons for these differences are presently not well known. Fortunately, a novel approach using the homologous recombination system in E. coli has allowed us to overcome the impediment of low transfection efficiency with animal adenoviruses and to rapidly reconstruct recombinants expressing a number of different viral proteins (Chartier et al., 1996).",

However, before it was possible to develop these viruses as vectors, it required the complete sequencing of the respective genomes and characterization of the various regions of the viral genome that could be used for insertion of foreign genes. Secondly, it required the production of cell lines for isolation of the recombinants. To achieve these two goals, we needed to complete the entire transcriptional map and sequence the genome of BAV-3 (Reddy et al., 1998) Genbank Accession No. AF030154 (Fig. 1\n). From the analysis of the genome and its similarity to other adenoviruses, we focused on characterizing the E1, E3 and E4 regions specifically in order to identify the boundaries of these regions for eventual removal to enhance the coding capacity of the virus for insertion of foreign genes. The combined coding capacity of these three regions in bovine adenovirus-3 is \u223c8 kB (E1, 3.5 kB; E3, 1.2 kB; E4, 3.2 kB). Following the removal of these three regions, it should be possible to insert a single large gene with essential promoters, etc. of \u223c8 kB or any combination of genes totalling 8 kB. Since most adenoviruses are thought to be able to package 105% of the genome, it should be possible to insert an additional 1.75 kB for a total of \u223c9.5 kB. These foreign genes could theoretically be inserted in each of the three different locations or could be combined in a single location. Presently, we have inserted genes into all three of these regions of BAV-3, but have not yet introduced genes into three different regions in the same construct. However, these possibilities are presently being investigated as are studies to incorporate a gene encoding for cytokines in combination with genes isolated from pathogens in an attempt to enhance immune responses at mucosal surfaces.",

Deletion of E1 and E4 is believed to result in the production of replication\u2013incompetent viruses, therefore, if viral recombinants are to be isolated, these viral functions need to be provided in trans in a complementing cell line. Although this is an extra step in the production of recombinant viruses, it results in a safer vaccine since the recombinants can infect animals but undergo an abortive infection and, therefore, cannot spread in the environment. This is considered to be important by regulatory agencies whose concern is environmental release of potential recombinants. Since the virus only undergoes a single cycle replication step, the level of antigen expression in vivo is believed to be lower than with recombinants which can replicate in the host. For example, genes inserted into the E3 region can infect normal host cells and undergo a number of replication cycles in vivo. This additional replication is believed to increase the quantity of protein that is produced in vivo and recognized by the host\u2019s immune response. As a result, replication\u2013competent viruses may induce higher levels of immunity than replication\u2013incompetent viruses.",

Regardless of whether the gD or TgD was used, the recombinants produced significant levels of immunity in both laboratory animals (cotton rats) and cattle (Mittal et al., 1996, Zakhartchouk et al., 1998). Delivery of these recombinants via systemic administration induced excellent levels of systemic immunity but no mucosal immunity. In contrast, delivery of the recombinants via the intranasal route lead to high mucosal lung antibody levels (both IgA and IgG) as well as systemic immunity. To demonstrate that the nasal or lung antibody was actually synthesized at the site of immunization, ELISPOT assays were performed. In all cases, animals immunized by the intranasal route showed evidence of antibody secreting cells in the mucosa, whereas systemically immunized animals did not (Fig. 2\n). These data supports previous studies which have lead to the concept of compartmentalization of immune system and a common mucosal immune system.",

Although immunization of animals with no antibodies to adenoviruses produce slightly higher immune responses to the transgene, Fig. 3\nclearly demonstrates that cattle possessing high levels of antibody to adenoviruses at the time of vaccination can still develop very significant immune responses to the transgene. Thus, animals that are seronegative to the transgene at the time of immunization, rapidly develop specific immunity to the transgene even after a single immunization and the immune response is boosted after a secondary immunization. Two weeks after boosting, calves were challenged with an intranasal challenge of 107 plaque-forming units of BHV-1 per animal. Each animal was clinically evaluated independently for temperature, depression, severity of nasal lesions, etc. Fig. 4\ndemonstrates the significant difference in clinical scores between animals immunized with a BAV-3 gD recombinant as compared to an equivalent BAV-3 lacking the gD gene. Although all animals did shed virus for the first 4 days, animals in the vaccinated group rapidly eliminated the virus such that by 5\u20136 days, very little virus was being shed from the nasal passages. In contrast, animals immunized with the BAV-3 were still shedding significant levels of virus.

To-date, we have expressed the genes for bovine parainfluenza-3, bovine virus diarrhea gp53, and corona viruses HE. To enhance the level of expression of bovine coronavirus genes, we used a synthetic intron that possibly modifies the splicing of these genes as they are transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (Reddy et al., 1999). By using this synthetic intron, we were able to increase the gene expression by over 50-fold. Thus, we feel that this system should be applicable for expression of genes from the majority of pathogens of interest.

It is only after that these types of studies are done, will we be able to get a true appreciation of the potential benefit of using adenovirus vectors in different species. Our studies with bovine adenovirus clearly demonstrate \u2018proof-of-principle\u2019 that these vectors can be used in cattle. Even more important is the observation that seropositive cattle can be immunized with these vectors. The possible reason for this is that mucosal immunity levels are not often sustained as long as serum antibody levels, thereby allowing infection of mucosal cells of the upper respiratory tract even in the presence of high serum antibody levels. Once the virus enters these mucosal cells, it can produce sufficient levels of antigen to induce an immune response in the host. Our preliminary results suggest that intranasal administration is more effective than intratracheal administration of the recombinant adenoviruses in seropositive animals. These studies further support the contention that viruses attach to the nasal mucosa before they are neutralized by antibodies. Intratracheal administration probably leads to neutralization of the virus before the virus can initiate infection. Support for this contention comes from the fact that serum antibody transudation occurs more efficiently in the lower lung than in the nasal mucosa.",

These studies indicate that the route of administration will need to be an important consideration when comparing immunization data with adenovirus vectors and developing the most effective protocol for their delivery. Our rapidly expanding knowledge of host responses to antigens and the role of cytokines in polarizing or modulating these responses, we predict, will play an important role in further improving the potential of adenovirus vectors. For example, it should be possible to construct adenovirus vectors co-expressing antigens and cytokines of interest. Expressing cytokines that induce mucosal immunity should both enhance the efficacy of the recombinants and, more importantly, induce the desired type of immune response. Based on the recent progress, both in using adenoviruses as vaccine vectors for infectious diseases or cancer immunotherapy, we are confident that recombinant adenoviruses will become an important part of our armamentarium of vaccines for humans and animals.",
