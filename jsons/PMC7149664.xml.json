            "text": "Bioterrorism, bioweapons, or biowarfare is a term used to describe the intentional or deliberate use, spread/release, dissemination or production of living organisms, toxins, and chemicals of animal or plant origin to produce such diseases that can harm or cause death of humans, animals, plants, and even the overall environment. The terrorist can spread it via air, water, soil, and food, and they can take few hours to several days to cause the effect. It is a very broad subject that includes diverse range of organisms (bacteria, pathogens, and viruses) and chemical toxins which are used to spread terror, danger, risk, and threat. This can be performed by an individual having vested interests or for retaliation, but it can also be sponsored by some government as part of a political agenda. In earlier days, anthrax and small pox diseases were used as a source of bioterrorism in the West and even recently, anthrax is a very commonly used agent for bioterrorism. This form of terrorism is the easiest because the agents are available easily, do not cause sound or blast (unless it involves chemicals), can cause harm across borders, and are widespread mostly as it can wipe out entire population (Khadori, 2006). There are three broad categories which specify the term bioterrorism. The categories are based on the threat ranging from highest to moderate and eventually to gradual (A, B, and C) (Table 7.1\n).",

However, world was making advancements in science and methods were being invented to take over the world and crush the enemy in a shorter time. So the easiest way to do it was to spread diseases that can weaken the enemy. It is usually believed that the plague epidemic in Europe was caused by some sailor who carried the disease from the enemy country (Riedel, 2004). Similarly, there has been incidences when during election, a poisonous dose of bacterial agent was mixed in the salads of local restaurants so that the voters turn out will be less and the competitors will lose (Barras and Greub, 2014). Then later, it became common to use bioterrorism during world wars, when it assumed the shape of chemical warfare. Mustard gas was used to blind the enemy, poison used to be sprayed in the freshwater sources to kill the population, food used to be poisoned, viruses were spread through prostitution, and so on. Recently, Ebola virus, bird flu, rota virus, H1N1, influenza, Naegleria, dengue fever, and many other forms of diseases are being spread among those countries where population is not getting controlled such as African and some Asian countries. Also, in Syria, recently the President Bashar al-Assad bombed the civilians with chemicals which resulted in huge casualties of children. It has been reported that after the onset of Gulf War, many countries sent agents in African countries to acquire such viruses and bacterial agents such as Ebola and botulinum to cause harm to either the enemy or the groups that were engaged in uprising against the tyrannical governments. Even such chemical gases like nerve gases are available in all European countries to counter the war threat (Handerson, 1998). Some examples of bioterrorism from history are enlisted in Table 7.2\n.",

            "text": "Globally, there are laboratories established to address bioterrorism. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there should be a laboratory response network which should include clinical microbiology laboratories that are responsible for identifying, detecting, and reporting bioterrorism. In addition, they must suggest the measures that can be adopted to remedy the effects. Moreover, the laboratory response network can be grouped category wise, dealing with the issue, like a category A laboratory can be a primary laboratory that can help detect such agents which can likely cause bioterrorism effects and so they should be equipped to conduct primary analysis. The B category laboratories can help to isolate and identify the exact agent responsible for bioterrorism and work for its remedial measures and design such strategies. Similarly, the category C laboratories should work to identify those agents that can cause potential damage as a bioterrorism agent in future; they all must act as public health laboratories. Mostly, microbiologists are capable enough to work out the effects and remedies for bioterrorism and the population suffering or at risk to suffer from its impacts. However, toxicologists also have a significant role to offer in this regard, as they are the ones who can identify the toxins from food, air, water, and even soil sources that can have an impact on the entire population and pose a risk to the overall public health (Lim et al., 2005). Usually, blood samples are taken from humans and animals for the identification of the cause, while water, crop, soil, and air sampling is also performed to identify the source. Ideal sampling techniques have been recommended by CDC which should be adopted globally as a standard procedure. Some common globally used laboratory techniques to detect bioterrorism agents include centrifugation, filtration for the separation of microorganism on cellular level, dielectrophoresis, immune-magnetic separation; and mostly polymerase chain reaction is also utilized by laboratory experts to identify biowarfare agents that can have impacts on genes and at molecular level (Bravata et al., 2004).\n",

The data should be collected from local clinics and hospital reports because bioterrorism is a public health issue, so a nation-wide surveillance system should be devised to monitor and manage the issue. This kind of surveillance system is also termed as conventional or traditional surveillance; however, modern surveillance system has also been adopted by many countries in the world to counter bioterrorism which include nation-wide automated surveillance for disease-related syndromes, analysis of routinely collected clinical, administrative, pharmacy, and laboratory data. Another important thing that should be considered for surveillance is the cost, social barriers, and environmental ethics. So, it does not matter which surveillance type is adopted as it depends upon the country's environmental, economic, and social conditions. Furthermore, there has to be a system of proper management and chain of command which should be supervised and regulated under the government as it is a concern for entire population. A regulatory body should be established to further remove the bias that can be questioned later (Hutwanger et al., 2003). However, problems can still exist because it is not easy to identify the culprit who release or transmit agents because the recipes to spread such kind of terror are easily available and accessible through the Internet. Also, the environment ethics is the subject being ignored the most specifically by the scientists who are engaged in performing experiments on viruses and bacteria, genetic modifications, etc. and is becoming a reason for the wide spread of bioterrorism in the world (Fig. 7.1\n).",

Pakistan, like other developing counties, is largely affected by it due to lack of proper sanitation, unsafe access to drinking and freshwater reservoirs, larger refugees, and overcrowded cities. Its origin can be traced to import of used tires in the country. Morbidity by dengue fever has been increasing since it was first reported in 1994 (Jahan, 2011). In 2012, Government of Punjab launched anti-dengue campaign in different schools, universities, and departments. Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMCFC) was given the responsibility to strengthen Tehsil Municipal Authorities in combating dengue. Digital maps were prepared by using geographical information system, and hotspots of dengue were identified. 520 shoulder foggers, 1600 spray pumps, and safety gears were provided to the teams who visit homes for sprays and site inspection. Various training sessions are arranged for capacity building of the staff (PMDFC, 2018). Despite numerous initiatives, dengue returns each year with larger number of cases. Lack of involvement of public, open drains, and insufficient access to sanitation can be major causes of the wide spread of this epidemic. Media has played effective role in spreading awareness about this menace; however, there are still gaps in community involvement in this sector.",

Therefore, disease outbreak should be reported immediately so that trained veterinarians and professionals can deal with biohazard of fowl birds. The symptoms of bird flu in fowls include edema in wattles, diarrhea, soft-shelled or misshaped eggs, lack of coordination in birds, swelling of birds, lack of appetite or energy, ruffled feathers, and nasal discharge (Bentoli, 2018). In 2003, human to human transmission of avian influenza was observed before which it was considered to affect birds only (Peiris et al., 2004).",

Avian influenza was first recorded in 2006 in Pakistan in Charsadda, Abbottabad, Pindi Bhatian, Attock, Sehala, and Tarlai areas of Islamabad. Nearly 100,000 birds were culled, and Rs. 100 million was spent as compensation. The surveillance system established nationwide helped stakeholders to prevent disasters from this disease (Hussain et al., 2008). CDC advises the travelers and people who deal it to take prevention measures (Khan et al., 2008). Pakistan gained the bird flu free status in 2007 (Poultry News, 2011).",

Our natural resources are being polluted at irreversible rate. Many indigenous species are at the verge of extinction. Evidence shows that state and nonstate actors are contributing to biosafety and security issues. Therefore, it is important to revise and review the legal structure pertaining bioterrorism. Government must ensure the construction of strong institutions which can carefully implement those legislations. The source of category A and B is localized; therefore strengthening of provincial Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA), implementation of self-monitoring programs by the industries, and legislations such as \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle can help to protect our natural resources. Research is the backbone of policies. Therefore, private sector should be encouraged to invest in research in this field.",
