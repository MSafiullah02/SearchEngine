            "text": "Thymic atrophy leads to depressed thyroid\u2013thymus axis (TTA) efficiency in old and in young propyl-thiouracil (PTU) treated mice (exp. hypothyroidism) (Fabris, 1992, Abou-Rabia and Kendall, 1994). Young-adult thymectomised (Tx) mice display impaired immune and thyroid functions. Neonatal thymus grafts or triiodothyronine (T3) treatments restore TTA efficiency (Fabris and Mocchegiani, 1985). In this context, the bioavailability of free zinc ions may be pivotal. Indeed, zinc supply restores TTA efficiency in old mice with prolonged survival (Mocchegiani et al., 1998b) as well as in clinical hypothyroidism (Down's syndrome) (DS) with reduction of infectious episodes (Licastro et al., 1992). The reasons are two. First, zinc confers biological activity to thymulin (Zn-FTS) (AT) (Dardenne et al., 1982), which decreases in ageing and DS (Fabris et al., 1984). The zinc-unbound form (FTS) of thymulin is inactive and increases in the plasma of both conditions. The in vitro zinc addition up to plasma samples unmasks FTS showing the total amount of thymulin produced (active Zn-FTS+inactive FTS) (TT). Therefore, the low zinc ion bioavailability allows a lack in saturating all thymulin molecules produced in ageing and DS (Fabris et al., 1984). Second, zinc finger home domains are required in activating T3 receptors (Darling et al., 1998) on T-cells (Arpin et al., 2000) and on thymic epithelial cells (TECs) believed to secrete thymulin (Villa-Verde et al., 1992). Zinc turnover is affected by metallothioneins (MTs) synthesis (Kagi and Shaffer, 1988) which is, in turn, induced by thyroid hormones (Yeiser et al., 1999), corticosterone and nutritional zinc (Cousins and Lee-Ambrose, 1992). MTs bind preferentially zinc than copper in ageing (Hamer, 1986) and hypothyroidism (Yeiser et al., 1999). Zn-MTs (I+II) are zinc donors during transient oxidative stress in young-adult age (Jacob et al., 1999) and in young TECs to activate thymulin (Coto et al., 1992). However, enhanced liver Zn-MTs, low zinc, depressed AT, reduced natural killer (NK) activity and hypothyroidism occur in constant oxidative stress, such as in ageing and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (Mocchegiani et al., 1997, Maliekal et al., 1997) as well as in constant dark regarding NK cells distribution (Dhabhar et al., 1995). Thus, while, on one hand, MTs capture zinc in zinc deficiency because zinc ions must not be lost (Kelly et al., 1996), on the other hand, MTs might not be zinc donors in ageing. This latter may cause low zinc ion bioavailability for TTA efficiency and NK activity (Mocchegiani et al., 1998a). The aim of this work/study is to clarify the role of Zn-MTs (I+II) in TTA efficiency during development and ageing. NK cells activity is included because it is affected by zinc and TTA efficiency, via Zn-FTS saturation (Muzzioli et al., 1992), and by stress (Dhabhar et al., 1995).",

The suspension was then centrifuged (2 min, 400 g) and the pellet suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/Ham's F12 medium (1:1) (DMEM/F12, Gibco, Germany). The cells were subjected to two-steps trypsin (0.1 and 0.25%, respectively) and 0.001% DNase treatment in order to avoid fibroblasts (Kurz et al., 1996). After three washes in PBS, the cells were dissociated by cautious triturating through Eppendorf tips and incubated in 3 ml of DMEM/F12 medium for 2\u20133 h at 37 \u00b0C in humidified 5% CO2-atmosphere in order to make to adhere the cells. The supernatant containing unattached TEC was seeded into another plastic flask containing DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and put in culture in humidified 5% CO2-atmosphere. The cultures were inspected for morphologically visible fibroblasts (spindle shaped cells). In cases of significant contamination, the cells were washed with PBS and underwent again to trypsinisation (Kurz et al., 1996). Separated TECs were washed three times in PBS. An aliquota (103) was resuspended in 1 ml of medium and underwent to TEC percentage analysis as described by Dardenne et al. (1989).",

The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 000g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatants (0.5 ml) were used for MT isolation on a Sephadex G-75 column (0.8 cm\u00d730). This was equilibrated with 1 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer solution in presence or in absence of the reducing agent mercaptoethanol (Suzuki, 1980). The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and rabbit MT was used as a calibration marker. Rabbit MT peak eluted in correspondence of fractions 13\u201317, which were recognised as containing MT (I+II) (Suzuki, 1980).

Thus, it is interesting to explore the quota of zinc or copper ions bound with MTs in ageing. We have used the liver for two reasons. First, because MTs are mainly produced in the liver (Kagi and Shaffer, 1988); second, because the liver is a site of extrathymic T-cell pathway prominent in ageing (Abo et al., 2000), and zinc is also required for extrathymic T-cell pathway (Mocchegiani et al., 1998a). Thus, separation of MTs is carried out from the liver of young and old mice using Sephadex G-75 columns (see Section 2).",

A minor one, bound to MT, is present in fractions 13\u201317. As regard to copper only one peak, in correspondence of MT elution volume, is observed. The amount of zinc bound to MT is significantly higher (P<0.05) in old mice (0.79\u00b10.1 \u03bcg; n=3) respect to young ones (0.65\u00b10.01 \u03bcg; n=3). On the contrary zinc sequestrated by HP is higher in young mice (1.5\u00b10.011 \u03bcg) respect to old mice (1.05\u00b10.013 \u03bcg). However, this differences is not significant (P>0.05) (Fig. 2).

Negative crude zinc balance, depressed thymic and NK activities, high liver MTs, enhanced corticosterone and altered thyroid hormones turnover occur in old and PTU mice (Table 2, Table 4). The likeness between old and PTU mice is largely due to the thymic atrophy in both strains of mice (Abou-Rabia and Kendall, 1994, Fabris et al., 1997). As such, degenerative diseases rise in PTU mice (Rittenhouse and Redei, 1997) affecting the survival, despite good \u2018health status\u2019 observed before PTU treatment (F. Orlando, unpublished observation). Physiological zinc supply restores thymic and NK activities as well as the survival in old (Mocchegiani et al., 1998a) and PTU mice with no modifications in basal liver MT concentration (Table 4). Young-adult Tx1 mice (evaluated 15 days after thymectomy) display high liver MTs, increased corticosterone, negative crude balance, altered thyroid hormones turnover and impaired NK cells activity, which are restored by zinc supply or by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice (Table 3). In contrast, young-adult Tx2 mice (evaluated 40 days after thymectomy) display positive crude zinc balance, normal plasma corticosterone and liver MT level, satisfactory thyroid\u2013immune profile and survival similar to normal mice (Table 2, Table 4 and Fig. 5). In vitro zinc restores TEC assessment and proliferation in PTU mice (Fig. 1A), as it occurs in old ones (Mocchegiani et al., 1998b). Significant inverse correlation exists between corticosterone and Zn-MTs before and after zinc supply in old and PTU mice. High corticosterone decreases TEC proliferation in pure TEC cell line (IT-45R1) (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "Immune damage (Khansari et al., 1990) and zinc loss occur during stress (King 1990). A synchrony exists between high TSH and enhanced adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) within the anterior pituitary in stress condition (Childs, 1992). Therefore, our findings confirm that high corticosterone is associated with low zinc ion biovailabilty and thyroid\u2013immune alteration in old and PTU mice. But, at the same time, they pin-point that high constant corticosterone affects abnormal MTs induction with no release of zinc from MT. Zinc is relevant for endocrine\u2013immune response (Mocchegiani et al., 2000b) and MT binds preferentially zinc ions in ageing (Fig. 2). Therefore, the no release of zinc by MT leads to few free zinc ions for TTA efficiency with subsequent TTA impairment. Zinc supply restores nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile and prolongs survival in old (Mocchegiani et al., 1998a) and PTU mice (Fig. 5). Thus, MTs synthesis, via corticosterone, is crucial in zinc homeostasis for TTA efficiency during development and ageing. Such an interpretation is much more relevant and, at the same time, very intriguing because zinc is also required for liver extrathymic T-cell pathway (Mocchegiani et al., 1998a), which is gradually prominent in Tx and old mice in order to compensate thymus absence or thymic atrophy, respectively (Abo et al., 2000). Indeed, Tx2 mice display natural normalisation in MTmRNA, in nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile and in survival. Therefore, the thymus gland may be more useful in TTA efficiency during development than in ageing in which, on the contrary, zinc turnover may become prominent. The restoration in nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice or by zinc supply in Tx1 recipients is on line with this interpretation. The discovery showing multiple neonatal thymus grafts ineffective on survival in old mice (Hirokawa, 1997), in comparison with zinc supply (Mocchegiani et al., 1998b), supports this interpretation.",

Such a release occurs in young-adult age during transient oxidative stress (Jacob et al., 1999). Oxidative stress and zinc deficiency are persistent in ageing (Fabris, 1994) and hypothyroidism (Licastro et al., 1992, Thoei et al., 1997). MTs capture zinc in zinc deficiency because zinc ions must not be lost (Kelly et al., 1996). But, the task of Zn-MTs as zinc donors (Coto et al., 1992, Kelly et al., 1996, Jacob et al., 1999) may be questioned in constant oxidative stress. Indeed: (i) exogenous zinc is necessary in the plasma samples from old (Mocchegiani et al. 1998a) and PTU mice as well as in the plasma from Down's syndrome subjects to activate thymulin, despite plasma zinc values are within the normal range for age (Fabris et al., 1984); (ii) in vitro zinc, rather than T3, restores TECs assessment and proliferation in PTU thymic cultures and increases TEC proliferation in pure rat TEC cell line (IT-45R1) (Fig. 1A and B). In this context, direct mechanisms of zinc involving protein-kinase-C (PKC) activation (Coto et al., 1992, Saha et al., 1995) or phase S stimulation of the cell cycle (Dreosti, 2001) have been proposed; (iii) high liver Zn-MTs (I+II), low zinc and depressed TTA efficiency are observed in young partial hepatectomised mice during liver regeneration (model of persistent oxidative stress and great inflammation) (Mocchegiani et al., 1997); (iv) lot of zinc ions bound with MT in the liver from old mice than young (Fig. 2); (v) mice overexpressing MTs (MT-I*) underwent to stress (constant dark for 10 days) display altered nutritional\u2013endocrine\u2013immune profile looking like old mice. The likeness is especially in reduced thymic cortex and in adding exogenous zinc in the plasma to reactivate thymulin, despite plasma zinc levels are within the normal range (Table 5, Table 6). All these points suggest no or very limited release of zinc from MT during high constant corticosterone production leading to low zinc ion bioavailability for endocrine\u2013immune response.",

The most relevant indirect evidence is the failure of zinc-finger protein (A20) in protecting liver cells by apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1 (Lee et al., 2000), which is in turn augmented in ageing (Fagiolo et al., 1993) and involved in MT induction (Andrews, 2000).",

In agreement with Cousins and Lee-Ambrose (1992), zinc supply increases liver MTmRNA in old and PTU mice (Fig. 3A and B) with, however, no significant modifications in basal liver Zn-MTs (I+II) concentrations after zinc supply (Table 4). These findings confirm that Zn-MTs (I+II) are saturated by pre-existing zinc ions during constant oxidative stress, as shown in old hepatectomised mice during liver regeneration (Mocchegiani et al., 1997). But, at the same time, they also suggest that increased MTmRNA by zinc may be related to faster Zn-MTs degradation with a balance between Zn-MTs production and degradation. As a consequence, a plateau in Zn-MTs protein production is maintained. Therefore, zinc supply preserves this balance and, as such, free zinc ions are always available for TTA efficiency. The presence of significant inverse correlation between Zn-MTs and corticosterone before and after zinc supply in PTU and old mice is on line with this assumption, which is reinforced by low MTmRNA in lymphocytes from very old mice (30 months of age) and human exceptional individuals (centenarians) (Mocchegiani et al., 2001).",
