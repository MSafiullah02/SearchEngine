            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) has complex and diverse functions in physiological and pathophysiological phenomena. The mechanisms of many events induced by NO are now well de\u00aened, so that a fundamental understanding of NO biology is almost established. Accumulated evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. NO biosynthesis, particularly through expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), occurs in a variety of microbial infections. Although antimicrobial activity of NO is appreciated for bacteria and protozoa, NO has opposing effects in virus infections such as in\u00afuenza virus pneumonia and certain other neurotropic virus infections. iNOS produces an excessive amount of NO for long periods, which allows generation of a highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, peroxynitrite, via a radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide. Thus, peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules. NO also appears to affect a host's immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, overproduction of NO in virus infections in mice is reported to suppress type 1 helper T-cell-dependent immune responses, leading to type 2 helper T-cell-biased immunological host responses. Thus, NO may be a host response modulator rather than a simple antiviral agent. The unique biological properties of NO are further illustrated by our recent data suggesting that viral mutation and evolution may be accelerated by NO-induced oxidative stress. Here, we discuss these multiple roles of NO in pathogenesis of virus infections as related to both non-speci\u00aec in\u00afammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO during infections in vivo.",

In the past decade, particular attention has been paid to the unique biological functions of nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous nitrogencentred inorganic radical that is produced endogenously in a number of cells and tissues. NO is critically involved in non-speci\u00aec (innate) and immunological host defense. It has antimicrobial actions against various pathogens via its cytotoxic or cytostatic effects. 1\u00b15 Potent host defence against intruding microbes is also mediated by oxygen radicals and active oxygen species, including superoxide anion radical (O 2 \u00b1 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and hypochlorite anion (OCl \u00b1 ), produced from phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and activated macrophages. 6 It is now well accepted that the chemical and biological reactivities of NO produced in environments such as in\u00afamed tissues are greatly affected by concomitantly formed oxygen radicals, particularly O 2 \u00b1 , through formation of reactive nitrogen oxides such as peroxynitrite (ONOO \u00b1 ). 7\u00b112 Although the importance of these reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediate species has been documented for host defence reactions against bacteria and fungi, 1\u00b15 their role in the pathogenesis of virus infections is only partly understood.",

Furthermore, the iNOS-inducing potential in bronchoalveolar lavage\u00afuid in in\u00afuenza virus pneumonia is attributable solely to IFN-c, as revealed by an immunoadsorption study using a speci\u00aec anti-IFN-c antibody. 34 These results strongly support the suggestion that IFN-c is a major cytokine inducing iNOS and NO overproduction in pathogenesis of virus infection. 15, 16, 31 Many previous reports indicate that type 1 helper T cell (Th1) responses are important for viral clearance. 39\u00b141 However, IFN-c, a Th1-dependent cytokine, seems to be inef\u00aecient in host defence against various viral pathogens including in\u00afuenza virus, Sendai virus, and vaccinia virus. 42\u00b144 In addition, lack of an iNOS-dependent antiviral effect is also noted for the same virus infections, which was recently con\u00aermed by a number of studies using iNOS-de\u00aecient (iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 ) mice. 44\u00b148 Downregulation of iNOS expression is also reported for some cytokines, e.g. interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-b. 49\u00b151 In addition, these suppressor cytokines may reduce NO production indirectly via induction of arginase, 52\u00b154 which diminishes the supply of the substrate (L-arginine) for iNOS. Because IL-4 and IL-10 are induced by type 2 helper T cell (Th2) responses, iNOS expression may be regulated by a Th1\u00b1Th2 balance involved in the host immune response to the intruding virus. In fact, in our in\u00afuenza model, induction of IL-4 seems to be inversely related to IFN-c and iNOS induction in virus-infected lungs, suggesting downregulation by IL-4 of NO overproduction. 16 Induction of arginase I mRNA has been identi\u00aeed in virus-infected lung, and the time pro\u00aele of its induction paralleled to IL-4 induction (our unpublished observation).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that NO affects the polarized Th1\u00b1Th2 response, causing a Th2-biased immunoregulatory balance, via a relatively speci\u00aec suppressive effect on Th1 subpopulations. 78\u00b180 Such NO-induced immunomodulation occurs during virus infection in mice, as revealed by recent studies of HSV-1 and in\u00afuenza virus infections. 45, 81 These biased Th2 responses are most clearly demonstrated by using iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice, which show enhanced Th1 immune responses after these infections. 45, 81 It is believed that Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-c, whereas production of IL-4 and IL-10 depends on Th2 cells. NO thus seems to downregulate the Th1-associated cytokine IFN-c, which is a major iNOS-inducing cytokine in virus infections as described above, and increases the Th2-associated IL-4 and IL-10 during virus infections in mice. However, the immunoregulatory effects of NO on Th1\u00b1Th2 balance are not commonly observed among different types of virus infections, and the pathological consequences of lack of iNOS are completely different in infections with different viruses. Liew's group showed that NO has a suppressive effect on the Th1 response in HSV-1 infection in the foot pad and the dorsal root ganglion in mice, as evidenced by increased IFN-c production and reduced levels of IL-4, and a subsequent elevation of anti-HSV-1 antibody in iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice. 81 HSV-1 clearance is delayed in iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice compared with the heterozygote mice, possibly because of impairment of the direct anti-HSV-1 activity of NO. In contrast, Karupiah et al. reported that the antiviral host defence in iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice against in\u00afuenza virus is much greater than that in the wild-type mice, possibly because the NO-induced impairment of the Th1 response (particularly IFN-c production) is restored in iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice. 45 The same group demonstrated that mouse poxvirus (EV) is susceptible to NO. Therefore, virus infection in iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice is signi\u00aecantly exacerbated, even though the Th1-dependent IFN-c response is enhanced by the disrupted iNOS gene. 82 Similarly, Lowenstein's group reported that the antiviral defence is eliminated in coxsackievirus-infected iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice. 83, 84 However, in infections with vaccinia virus and corona virus (MHV), iNOS de\u00aeciency affects neither antiviral host defence nor pathology of viral diseases. 44 Also, the antiviral immunological response against LCMV is unimpaired in mice lacking iNOS, although T-cell-mediated in\u00afammation induced by LCMV is reduced. 46 Depending on the type of virus, Th cells, divided into two subsets (Th1 and Th2), protect hosts from intruding viral pathogens via virus-speci\u00aec Th1 responses, potentiation of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and B-cell proliferation. 85, 86 For non-cytopathic virus infections, CTLs rather than Th1\u00b1Th2 cells are important for antiviral host defenses. 85, 87 In contrast, some types of viruses, such as in\u00afuenza virus, can be eradicated without the help of CTLs. 41 A virus-speci\u00aec Th1 response is more important for in\u00afuenza antiviral defence than the Th2 responses, because Th2 cells exacerbate pathological lung reactions in in\u00afuenza pneumonia. 88 In this context, Karupiah et al. reported that NO impairs the anti-in\u00afuenza virus response of the host by suppressing Th1-dependent IFN-c induction and tipping the Th1\u00b1Th2 balance toward Th2 domination. 45 However, it has now been demonstrated that IFN-c, a Th1-dependent cytokine, is eventually inef\u00aecient in clearance of in\u00afuenza virus from infectious foci, 42 and even IL-4, induced by Th2 responses, possesses antiviral activity against murine paramyxovirus (Sendai virus). 89 Our recent experiments using iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice indicate that clearance of virus from lungs infected with either in\u00afuenza virus or Sendai virus is not affected by a lack of iNOS expression (Akaike et al., unpublished observation). 48 In fact, iNOS \u00b1/\u00b1 mice recuperate from viral pneumonia much better than do wild-type animals, because of reduced levels of oxidative stress in virus-infected tissues. 48 Therefore, not only NO-induced Th1 suppression, but also NO-induced oxidative injury may, be attributable to pathogenesis of infection with certain viruses that are resistant to the direct antiviral actions of NO.",

Overproduction of NO in the Salmonella-infected liver parallels the bacterial growth as identi\u00aeed by ESR spectroscopy. Here, the consequence of suppression of NO or O 2 \u00b1 is, however, completely opposite to the effect in the in\u00afuenza model. Treatment of murine salmonellosis with either L-NMMA or allopurinol results in a greater mortality rate as well as increased bacterial growth. 5 It is thus suggested that NO and O 2 \u00b1 , and possibly ONOO \u00b1 , function as endogenous antimicrobial agents. The opposite effects of NO in different infectious diseases may occur as a result of different modes of microbial replication and invasion of host tissues. Most bacteria can be con\u00aened to areas of septic foci, which are most typically abscesses or granulomas in the tissues. Therefore, chemically reactive NO, O 2 \u00b1 , and ONOO \u00b1 can affect bacteria relatively selectively; the surrounding normal tissue remains intact.

A typical base substitution caused by ONOO \u00b1 is G to T transversion, which is an indirect result of depurination of nitroguanine in DNA. 96, 97 A recent study documented that a high output of NO induced mutations in an endogenous hypoxanthine\u00b1 guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene of murine macrophages expressing iNOS. 98 As described in earlier sections, overproduction of NO and oxygen radicals appears to be a common phenomenon in various infections.

Free radicals are produced primarily as effector molecules of the host defence response. Their biological effects, however, are not necessarily bene\u00aecial to the infected host. Understanding of the pathophysiological func-tions of NO and oxygen radicals will provide profound insights into many aspects of infectious diseases. ",
