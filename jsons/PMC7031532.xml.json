            "text": "Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is the new wave of diseases that has hit the human population in the last few decades- the Metabolic Syndrome Era. It has become pandemic and with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) clubbed under the MS umbrella, millions of people around the globe have come under its grip. Though obesity and T2D are ubiquitous, there exists a pattern of prevalence based on ethnicity. A recent report has identified demographic transitions, nutrition and lifestyle in the backdrop of genetic predisposition as the chief factors responsible for the rising trend of obesity associated amongst South Asians1. Over accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (AT) has been identified as one of the major driving factors towards T2D. Adipose tissue is an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis by virtue of the adipokines (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory) that it secretes. In obese conditions, the fine-tuned balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines gets altered leading to various metabolic disorders2. These bioactive peptides act locally and distally to calibrate and fine tune various metabolic pathways. Adiponectin is one such calibrator which is abundantly expressed in white adipose tissue3. It circulates in three polymorphic forms, low molecular weight (LMW), moderate molecular weight (MMW) and high molecular weight (HMW). Interestingly, the ratio of plasma HMW adiponectin to total adiponectin is more strongly correlated with plasma glucose levels than any of the forms alone4. Adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ/APM1/GBP28) locus, 3q27, has been strongly associated with a variety of metabolic disorders like- impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, dyslipidemia and T2D5\u20137. Studies undertaken on different ethnic groups have shown positive association of certain SNPs of the adiponectin gene with T2D3,8\u201311. However, T2D being a multi-factorial and polygenic metabolic disorder12, significant variations have been reported concerning the genetic architecture underlying T2D amongst different ethnic populations13,14. The SNPs to be studied were selected based on the following criteria: (1) validated SNPs for frequency in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), (2) SNPs with scientific evidence for their role in augmented protein synthesis. ADIPOQ comprises of 2 introns and 3 exons encoding for the 30 kDa adiponectin protein15. Four SNPs were studied, \u221211377C/G (rs266729) in promoter, +10211T/G (rs17846866) in intron 1, +45T/G (rs2241766) in exon 2 and +276G/T (rs1501299) in intron 2, to examine their association with T2D. Since Indian population is relatively non-homogenous, we conducted our study in native Gujarat, and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) population independently. We also aimed to study the genotype-phenotype association of the above-mentioned SNPs with Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Body Mass Index (BMI), plasma lipid profile and T2D.",

It was ensured that at least five previous generations of the study subjects were of the respective ethnicities. Blood collection camps were conducted to guarantee the involvement of all the socio-economic strata in the study. The importance of the study was explained to all the participants and written consent was obtained from all patients, and age and sex-matched control subjects. The study group of Gujarat population included 475 diabetes patients (211 males and 264 females) and 493 control subjects (250 males and 243 females) while, the study group of J&K included 507 diabetes patients (282 males and 225 females) and 300 controls (140 males and 160 females) between the age group of 30 to 67 years. The T2D patients recruited for the study displayed FBG > 125 mg/dL16. Patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or cancer were excluded from the study. Samples of visceral (omental) adipose tissue were taken from individuals of Gujarat population undergoing bariatric surgery and fasting clinical parameters of all the study subjects are as described previously17. A detailed family history of the patients was recorded based on a questionnaire to collect information on first- and second-degree relatives and their history of T2D. The controls selected showed FBG < 110 mg/dL with no prior history of T2D. They were healthy and disease or infection free. The study subjects included both obese and lean individuals and their BMI (weight in kg/height in m2) was calculated by recording height and weight.",

The genotypes have been analyzed in an additive, dominant and recessive model as there was low genotype frequency of the homozygous minor alleles (<10% frequency). P values less than 0.0125 for genotype and allele distribution were considered as statistically significant as per Bonferroni\u2019s correction for multiple testing. The strength of association of the ADIPOQ SNPs with the risk for T2D was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients (D\u2032 = D/Dmax) and r2 values for the pair of the most common alleles at each site were obtained using http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php20. Association studies of SNPs with other parameters were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal Wallis test. Adjustments for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, and BMI were also done for the samples. Relative gene expression of ADIPOQ, and GAPDH, IPO8 and ACTB levels and fold change (2\u2212\u2206\u2206Cp values) in T2D patients and control groups were plotted and analyzed by unpaired t-test. All the analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism 5 software. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant for all the association studies. To predict the functional impact of non-coding polymorphisms, ENCODE prediction tool (https://www.encodeproject.org/) was employed21.",

On the contrary, adiponectin2, omentin-125, melatonin26 and vaspin27 are known to enhance insulin sensitivity. The normal range of total adiponectin in healthy individuals is reported to be 2\u201320 \u00b5g/mL28. The characteristic short stature of South Asians combined with visceral adiposity leads to an increased weight per area distribution defined by body mass index predisposing those to metabolic diseases1,29\u201331.

            "text": "Adiponectin gene expression in an adipose tissue is regulated by a 34 bp enhancer located in the first intron37. Therefore, the finding of +10211T/G (rs17846866) located close to the enhancer in the region of the first intron affecting lipid metabolism and adiponectin levels in the present study is of significance. Though the ENCODE data base doesn\u2019t show an overlap of this polymorphism with any cREs or display any cREs within 2 kb; eQTL database GTex shows TG and GG genotypes of +10211T/G (rs17846866) to have significantly reduced levels of plasma adiponectin similar to our findings. Additionally, this SNP is also seen to be associated with increased BMI, FBG, TG, TC and reduced HDL-c. To date, three independent studies, including ours, have established the association of +10211T/G (rs17846866) with three different Indian populations belonging to different demographical and geographical regions, thus further validating the significance of this SNP10,11. However, the results from J&K population did not reveal any such association. +45T/G (rs2241766) is a synonymous SNP with a codon change from GGT to GGG. Though studies on Chinese Han population found an association between +45T/G (rs2241766) and insulin resistance38; our results show no association between +45T/G (rs2241766) and T2D as supported by studies on Italian, French and Swedish populations3,8,9. We report a significant association of +276G/T (rs1501299) with T2D, and serum lipid profile in Gujarat population while no association was found in J&K population. Supporting our data from Gujarat population, similar results were obtained in earlier studies in German39, Swedish40, Italian Caucasian41, French Caucasian3 and South Indian populations35. However, the results of the study by Hara et al.42 in Japanese subjects were in accordance with the results obtained in J&K population. In Gujarat population, the TT genotype conferred approximately double risk for developing T2D against the GG genotype in +276G/T (rs1501299). Furthermore, +276G/T (rs1501299) is also found to be linked with increased BMI, FBG, TG, and TC, and reduced HDL-c in males. These findings also suggest the association of +276G/T (rs1501299) with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), co-morbidity associated with T2D as supported by Wang et al.43. Additionally, we have also found increased levels of TNF\u03b1, Free Fatty Acids (FFA) and resistin in obese patients17,44. Since TNF\u03b1 is shown to be an important regulator of adiponectin multimerization45, our observations of increased TNF\u03b1, reduced adiponectin transcript and HMW adiponectin levels in obese patients are self-explanatory. We had also reported a rise in IL1\u03b2 levels in obese diabetic patients46, asserting the rise in pro-inflammatory adipokine and drop in anti-inflammatory adipokine in obesity-associated low-grade inflammatory condition. Further, adiponectin levels show sexual dimorphism47 and our results further confirm this as females in general demonstrated a higher tendency of HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio than males. Also, a significant drop in adiponectin ratio of lean diabetic individuals was observed which was further pronounced in obese diabetic patients. Moreover, the overall plasma HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio tends to be lower in subjects with the homozygous mutant allele for +10211T/G (rs17846866) and +276G/T (rs1501299). In concordance with our findings, adiponectin levels were strongly and inversely associated with diabetes risk48,49. Alongside, we had also reported the prevalence of a significantly high number of angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism in the same population50. The ACE D allele has in particular been shown to be associated with increased angiotensin II51 which may be further adding to the down regulation of adiponectin. We suggest that the reduced HMW adiponectin in particular is responsible for insulin resistance as, among the adiponectin isoforms, the HMW isoform binds to its receptor with maximum affinity leading to a potent activation of 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Thus, the lowered HMW adiponectin may be partly responsible for developing T2D52. The increased level of TG may be due to a decrease in the lipoprotein lipase activity and Very Low-Density Lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) expression levels, which have been proposed to be modulated by adiponectin53. While HDL-c levels and their particle size are inversely correlated with the catabolic rate of apolipoprotein (ApoA-I), a direct role of reduced adiponectin with increased catabolism of the major ApoA-I present in HDL-c has been proposed54, explaining how hypoadiponectinemia leads to decreased HDL-c levels. The correlation between hypoadiponectinemia and reduced HDL-c levels, as observed by us further strengthens the hypothesis. To summarize, +10211T/G (rs17846866) and +276G/T (rs1501299) are significantly associated with increased FBG, BMI, TG, TC and reduced HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio. More importantly, the haplotype analysis reveals that individuals with GGTG haplotype in particular show an increased tendency towards obesity induced T2D55 (Fig. 2). Thus, we may conclude that adiponectin gene is associated with T2D, nonetheless variation in the susceptibility loci within the gene depends on ethnic variation among different populations. However, further investigations to understand the mechanistic aspects of genetic variants regulating adiponectin levels are warranted in other cohorts.",
