Quick planning by the hospital Educational Services staff allowed for respirator fit-testing of more than 400 staff members over a 2-day period. The staff was issued the new masks and asked to maintain those masks until they worked with a potential SARS patient or the mask became soiled. The N95 mask supply has returned to near-normal levels, but now the masks are accounted for to prevent the loss of large numbers.

Researchers in Toronto noted that 95% of the patients in their study received empirical antibiotics per guidelines for management of community-acquired pneumonia; 88% received ribavirin; and 40% received steroids. Of the patients who received ribavirin, a significant number experienced toxicity and 18% discontinued therapy prematurely.1 The CDC notes that the majority of US residents with SARS who had evidence of coronavirus recovered or their condition stabilized clinically without specific antiviral therapy. They further note that the efficacy of available antiviral therapies against coronavirus infection is unknown.12\n",
