Paramyxoviruses are enveloped, non\u2010segmented, pleomorphic RNA viruses containing a single stranded, negative\u2010sense genome. Avian paramyxoviruses that have been isolated from birds; however, due to changes in taxonomy is now referred to as avian avulavirus (AAvV) (Amarasinghe et al., 2017). There are 13 described AAvV serotypes (AAvV\u20101 to \u201013) based on neuraminidase inhibition tests and hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and eight another putative serotypes have been recently isolated (AAvV\u201014 to \u201021) (Jeong et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Neira et al., 2017; Thampaisarn et al., 2017; Thomazelli et al., 2017; Yamamoto, Ito, & Ito, 2016). While very limited information is known about the biological and molecular characteristics of AAvV\u20102 to \u201021, extensive study has been mainly conducted on AAvV\u20101 (Newcastle disease virus, NDV) (Cardenas\u2010Garcia et al., 2015; Umali, Ito, Katoh, & Ito, 2014).",

Other serotypes AAvV, such as AAVV\u20102, \u20103 and \u20107, are also known to cause reproductive and respiratory diseases in turkeys and chickens, sometimes resulting in death of the infected birds (Samuel, Subbiah, Shive, Collins, & Samal, 2011; Warke, Stallknecht, Williams, Pritchard, & Mundt, 2008). Meanwhile, some serotypes AAvV strains display their specific host restriction, such as AAvV\u20105 cause diarrhoea and high mortality in budgerigars but not in chickens and ducks (Briand, Henry, Massin, & Jestin, 2012). However, AAvV\u20106 was first identified at a domestic duck in 1977 from Hong Kong (duck/Hong Kong/18/199/77) and then was found to cause drop in egg production and mild respiratory disease in turkeys, but was avirulent in chickens (Chang et al., 2001; Tian et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2010). But recent serosurveillance of commercial chickens in the USA showed the likely prevalence of all serotypes AAvV including AAvV\u20106, excepted with AAvV\u20105 (Warke, Appleby, & Mundt, 2008).",

Surveillance data were also observed by researchers who performed similar monitoring researches of wild birds and domestic poultry and identified AAvV\u20106 viruses (Shortridge, Alexander, & Collins, 1980; Sobolev et al., 2016), such as the isolate rate of AAvV\u20106 in shorebirds was 2.4% in Germany during the year 2001\u20132002 (Hlinak et al., 2006) and in free\u2010living wild ducks was 0.76\u2030 in South Korea during the winter season (November to February) between 2010 and 2014 (Choi et al., 2018). However, our current data clearly indicate that AAvV\u20106 is a lower isolated virus (the isolate rate was 0.1\u2031, 1/9, 872) in wild birds in China from the year 2013\u20132017 as compared with other AAvVs, such as AAvV\u20101 and \u20104 (Yin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015). Meanwhile, no AAvV\u20106 isolate was obtained from domestic poultry. To our best knowledge, most of reported AAvV\u20106 viruses were isolated from waterfowl species, such as geese, teal, mallard and so on (Figure 1). Therefore, future AAvV\u20106 monitoring studies in domestic poultry should include more samples from LBMs as well as their susceptibility to AAvV\u20106 viruses may differ from that of wild bird species.",

For AAvV\u20106/mallard/Hubei/2015, deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the F protein, 112PAPEPR*L117, that contains a monobasic aa residue (arginine, R), is identical to most of AAvV\u20106 strains (Table 2). However, there are several differences in the cleavage site of AAvV\u20106/duck/Italy/4524\u20102/07 and AAvV\u20106/red\u2010necked stint/Japan/8KS0813/2008 (112SIREPR*L117) strains. In addition, this Hubei isolate was able to grown in chicken cell lines HD11 and DF\u20101 only with the addition of trypsin. The MDT score was more than 168 hr, with no mortality after 7 days, as well as both ICPI and IVPI were 0, suggesting this Hubei isolate is a low virulent virus for chickens.",

However, the complete F gene sequence is considered as the main target for molecular epidemiological investigations and genotyping of AAvV. Meanwhile, a unified nomenclature and classification system of the NDV (AAvV\u20101) genotyping method based on the mean inter\u2010populational evolutionary distances of the complete F gene sequence, with cut\u2010off values more than 10% to assign new genotypes (Diel et al., 2012), will provide a more rational and scientific genotyping method for epidemiological studies of other serotypes AAvV. Therefore, 24 reported AAvV\u20106 isolates, including this Hubei isolate, were classified into two genotypes (I and II, with the mean inter\u2010populational evolutionary distances between groups varying of 0.476 [47.6%] (Figure 1b; Table 3a). Furthermore, the isolates within genotype I and II were grouped into two subgenotypes (Ia and Ib, with the mean inter\u2010populational evolutionary distances between groups was 0.0485 [4.85%] and IIa and IIb, with the mean inter\u2010populational evolutionary distances between groups was 0.0438 [4.385%]) respectively (Figure 1b; Table 3b). To our interestingly, no similar genotype II isolates were detected in domestic poultry and wild birds of this study during the year 2015\u20132017, suggesting that no genotype II viruses were introduced into China from nearby country Japan and south Korea and limited virus circulation. Taken together, at least two genotypes (I and II) is existed within AAvV\u20106, based on the evolutionary distances of the complete F gene. Meanwhile, highly similar genotype I and II AAvV\u20106 isolates from distinct bird species in different regions of America, Asian and Europe clearly demonstrate that AAvV\u20106 can be intercontinental and inter\u2010species transmitted by wild migratory birds.",

By comparison, the pathological phenomenon which AAvV\u20106 causes are relatively weak, just manifested in decreased egg production and mild respiratory disease in turkeys and was avirulent in chickens under normal circumstances (Alexander, 2000; Saif & Barnes, 2008; Sobolev et al., 2016). As a low virulence virus for chickens and low separation rate, the potential harm of the AAvV\u20106 is easily overlooked. However, in a recent study of the pathogenicity of two AAvV\u20106 variant isolates, AAvV\u20106/red\u2010necked stint/Japan/8KS0813/2008 and AAvV\u20136/duck/Hong Kong/18/199/1977, as representative isolate of genotype I and II respectively, could replicate in respiratory tissues of infected mice and induce respiratory disease, sometimes resulting in death of the infected mice (Bui et al., 2017). Further researches about the virulence and susceptibility of AAvV\u20106 should be include more isolates, since differences of viral propagation properties in same cells were observed between the two variant isolates, owing to the change of host from red\u2010necked stint to duck and sites where the two variant isolates separated at such a distance to some extent (Bui et al., 2014). Therefore, the identification and isolation of Hubei isolate is beneficial for the further understanding of HA\u2010negative AAvV\u20106 in this study for the high sequence identity (99.1%\u201399.2%) with two Jilin isolates (AAvV\u20106/mallard/Jilin/190/2011 and AAvV\u20106/mallard/Jilin/127/2011) and the same cleavage site with other AAvV\u20106 isolates.",

Because the Russian Far East, eastern Mongolia, eastern Siberia, Alaska, Black Sea/Mediterranean and Asian are linked by the migratory routes of the migratory wild bird species investigated here, our conclusion should commonly be applicable to other similar Asian AAvV\u20106 isolates. Bird shows, import and trade are other potential opportunities that easily allow the introduce of emerging isolates to susceptible populations, unless strict control measures are complied. The AAvV\u20106 Hubei isolate here is epidemiological connected to AAvV\u20106 from other geographical areas, such as FarEast, Siberia, Kazakhstan and South Korea, therefore their presence implies the potential risk of AAvV\u20106 being spread into the region and country, possibly causing to domestic poultry and wild birds infections. It also necessitates the demand for constant epidemiological surveillance for AAvV\u20106 isolates among domestic poultry and wild birds in China to discover the potential spread of novel variants from other countries and regions.",
