In this study, for the first time we show that BoHV-1 infection manipulated phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, as demonstrated by the activation of PLC\u03b3-1 at both early stages [at 0.5 h post-infection (hpi)] and late stages (4-12 hpi) during the virus infection of MDBK cells. Viral entry, and de novo protein expression and/or DNA replication were potentially responsible for the activation of PLC\u03b3-1 signaling. PLC signaling inhibitors of both U73122 and edelfosine significantly inhibited BoHV-1 replication in both bovine kidney cells (MDBK) and rabbit skin cells (RS-1) in a dose-dependent manner by affecting the virus entry stage(s). In addition, the activation of Erk1/2 and p38MAPK signaling, and the enhanced generation of ROS by BoHV-1 infection were obviously ameliorated by chemical inhibition of PLC signaling, implying the requirement of PLC signaling in ROS production and these MAPK pathway activation. These results suggest that the activation of PLC signaling is a potential pathogenic mechanism for BoHV-1 infection.",

            "text": "Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is an enveloped virus belonging to Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily member [1] . Acute infection of cattle with BoHV-1 generally results in inflammatory disease within the upper respiratory tract, nasal cavity, and ocular cavity, which leads to erosion of the mucosal surface. BoHV-1 also suppresses host immune responses by diverse mechanisms which lead to secondary infections [2] . BoHV-1 together with other viruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V) and bovine coronaviruses, and bacteria including Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma spp are the etiologies of life-threatening pneumonia known as bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), the most important disease in cattle [2] [3] [4] . BoHV-1 infection stimulates inflammasome formation [5] , which contributes to BRDC by enhancing the inflammatory response in the lung. A BoHV-1 entry receptor, poliovirus receptor related 1, has been identified to be a BRDC susceptibility gene for Holstein calves [6] , confirming the critical role of BoHV-1 as a cofactor for BRDC. BoHV-1 infection and the virus induced BRDC inflict a great economic lost to the cattle industry, worldwide [3] .",

In addition, we recently identified that BoHV-1 infection increases the generation of inflammatory mediator, reactive oxidative species (ROS) [9] , which is also a potential mechanism to promote inflammatory response. Over-produced ROS mediated inflammatory response by diverse mechanisms in varied virus infections. In the context of Influenza virus or Dengue virus infection, ROS promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 [10] [11] [12] . In HSV-1 infected murine microglial cells, ROS mediated the regulation of some inflammation pertinent signaling, such as p38MAPK and Erk1/2 pathways [13] . In contrast, the activation of p38MAPK and Erk1/2 signaling by BoHV-1 infection is not mediated by over-produced ROS [14] , though BoHV-1 and HSV-1 are genetically closed [9] . How BoHV-1 infection contributes to ROS production and the activation of p38MAPK and Erk1/2 signaling has yet to be found.",

NaCl-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelial cells is partially dependent on the activities of PLC signaling [19] . The PLC family contains six members (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b7 and \u03b6) that are further subdivided into 13 isoforms, which are functionally dependent on the activation of a series of downstream signalings, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium signaling [20] . It has been reported that PLC\u03b3-1 signaling is required by influenza virus for efficient replication in both T-cells and human airway epithelial A549 cells, and for the virus induced inflammatory response mediated by macrophages [18, 21, 22] , which highlighted the importance of PLC signaling in virus pathogenicity. However, the involvement of PLC signaling in BoHV-1 infection is unknown.",

To see whether the inhibitory effect of PLC inhibitors on BoHV-1 replication was bovine kidney cell specific, RS-1 cells were utilized for further evaluation. As can be seen in Figure 1D , E, both inhibitors at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM significantly reduced the virus yield in RS-1 cells. The known herpesvirus inhibitor ACY at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM decreased the virus titer of ~1-log compared to the control ( Figure 1F ), which validated the inhibitory effects of both U73122 and edelfosine on BoHV-1 replication in RS-1 cells. In addition, the reduced virus yield by both U73122 and edelfosine in both MDBK cells and RS-1 cells was not due to the chemical cytotoxicity, because both inhibitors at the tested concentrations did not show apparent cytotoxicity to neither MDBK cells nor RS-1 cells detected with the MTT assay ( Figure 1G ).

To address this question, the ability of UV-inactivated BoHV-1 virus to stimulate the phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) in MDBK cells was examined as previously described [21] . UV-inactivated virus could bind to the virus receptors and enter the cells, but could not express viral genes [26] . Here, the ability for UV-irradiated viral particles to bind to MDBK cells was confirmed with FACS assay ( Figure 3C ). As expected, UV-irradiated BoHV-1 could also increase the phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248), compared to the control, though there is a minor reduced ability compared to the infectious viral particles (Figure 3B ). This suggests that the virus entry would initially stimulate the phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) which corroborated the result that PLC signaling inhibitors affected the virus entry stage(s) (Figure 2A) . We also supposed that de novo viral protein expression or DNA replication may potentially account for the enhanced phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) that occurred at 4, 8 and 12 hpi ( Figure 3A) . To test the hypothesis, MDBK cells were treated with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), a specific inhibitor targeting the viral DNA polymerase [27] , through virus infection. As a result, PAA treatment significantly inhibited the virus replication in MDBK cells ( Figure 3E ), and apparently reduced the phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) at 12 hpi but not at 0.5 hpi which was stimulated by BoHV-1 infection while PAA treatment only had a minor effect on viral induced phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) at 0.5 hpi ( Figure 3E ). Thus, de novo viral protein production and/or DNA replication seems to be correlated to the elevated levels of phosphorylated PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248).",

As expected, both inhibitors decreased the levels of phosphorylated PLC\u03b3-1(Ser1248) in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 4A and  B ; P-PLC\u03b3-1 panel), validating the specific effect of these chemicals on PLC signaling. BoHV-1-induced activation of Erk1/2 and p38MAPK, was attenuated by U73122 and edelfosine in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4A  and B , P-Erk1/2 and P-p38MAPK panels). However, these inhibitor treatments did not have a dramatic effect on total steady state protein levels of PLC\u03b3-1, Erk1/1 or p38MAPK following BoHV-1 infection ( Figure 4C ). Therefore, our results indicated that the activation of Erk1/2 and p38MAPK signaling by BoHV-1-infection was partially dependent on PLC signaling.",
