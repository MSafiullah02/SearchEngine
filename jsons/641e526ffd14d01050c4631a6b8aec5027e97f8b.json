In vivo, untreated MHV-3-infected mice all developed clinical and biochemical signs of acute viral hepatitis and died by day 4 post infection. Livers recovered from untreated infected mice showed greater than 90% necrosis. In contrast, survival was enhanced in both ribavirin-and HRC 203-treated mice with a marked reduction in biochemical [ALT max 964 \u060e 128 IU/L (ribavirin); 848 \u060e 212 IU/L (HRC 203)] and histological evidence of hepatic necrosis (<10% in ribavirin/HRC 203 vs. 90% in untreated controls). Clinically, HRC 203-treated mice behaved normally, in contrast to ribavirin-treated mice, which developed lethargy and abnormal fur texture. In conclusion, targeted delivery of ribavirin to the liver alters the course of MHV-3 infection as demonstrated by prolonged survival, improved behavior, and reduced signs of histologically evident disease, as well as inhibition of viral replication and production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro.

            "text": "Coupling of ribavirin to a carrier molecule offers the potential of a therapeutic with improved safety and efficacy by targeting drug delivery of ribavirin to key tissues infected by HCV while preventing the hemolytic anemia that is caused by exposure of red blood cells to free ribavirin. Targeting of drugs by attachment to carrier molecules for delivery to specific tissues via receptor-mediated endocytosis is a recently established method for improv-ing efficacy, decreasing toxic side effects, and providing an alternative to problematic systemic drug therapy. 7, 8 Acellular hemoglobin (Hb) is rapidly bound to haptoglobin (Hp) in vivo and taken up by cells bearing receptors for the Hb-Hp complex, principally by macrophages (Kupffer cells) and hepatocytes as a natural pathway for Hb clearance. [9] [10] [11] The Hb-Hp scavenger receptor, CD163, was identified as a marker for cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. 9 The levels of this receptor are increased in the livers of patients with acute hepatitis. 12 HRC 203 is a conjugate of human hemoglobin and ribavirin bound to haptoglobin (Hp-Hb-RV) 13 designed to deliver ribavirin to the liver to avoid systemic toxicity associated with chronic ribavirin therapy. Selective uptake of the Hb-Hp complex is mediated through binding of the complex to the receptor followed by entry into lysosomes. Receptor-mediated binding and uptake of HRC 203 has been demonstrated in model cells expressing Hb-Hp receptors. 13 Acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, has been shown to release bioactive ribavirin from HRC 203 in vitro. 13 Similar release of active drug is expected after lysosomal uptake of the conjugate in target cells in vivo. Multiple ribavirin molecules are conjugated to each Hb molecule; therefore, HRC 203 has the potential to achieve higher intracellular doses of ribavirin in target tissues than are currently feasible. We estimated that comparable liver concentrations could be achieved or exceeded by administering endogenous Hp-saturating doses of Hb-ribavirin on the order of 1 to 2 g Hb. 14 HRC 203 may be effective in maintaining optimal ribavirin levels in HCV patients who would otherwise require dose reduction or discontinuation of ribavirin therapy because of systemic consequences.",

            "text": "The aim of these studies was to evaluate the effect of HRC 203 in a mouse model of viral hepatitis induced by the coronavirus MHV-3. MHV-3 is the largest of the Coronavirus family of positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome size of 32 kb, a 5\u0408 cap structure, and a 3\u0408 poly(A) tail. MHV-3 replicates in the liver-derived macrophages (Kupffer cells), endothelial cells, and parenchymal cells (hepatocytes), with higher degrees of replication in the macrophage reservoir. Viral replication in macrophages appears to be a prerequisite for MHV-3 to gain access to hepatocytes. 15 Viral infection of macrophages leads to a marked inflammatory response associated with a Th2 cellular immune response and production of nonneutralizing antibodies. 16, 17 This response fails to control viral replication. Induction of pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) and interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425) activate endothelial cells and increase their expression of adhesion molecules, resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, vasoconstriction, intravascu-lar thrombosis, fibrin deposition, and liver necrosis. Within 3 to 4 days post-infection, fulminant hepatic failure results, leading to death in 80% to 90% of infected mice. 18 The current studies were designed to examine the potential for HRC 203 to treat MHV-3 infection through both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory pathways.",

These data are consistent with previous reports that dexamethasone induces the expression of CD163 on the surface of macrophages. 26",

Macrophages produced significantly higher levels of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 in response to MHV-3 infection in comparison with basal values (Fig. 3) . Both ribavirin (800 mol/L) and HRC 203 (40 mol/L conjugated ribavirin) significantly inhibited the production of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 in MHV-3-infected macrophages compared with controls. Both compounds prevented increases in cytokine levels above baseline; however, this effect was achieved using a much lower dose (1/20 th ) of ribavirin in the HRC 203 conjugated form than in the free ribavirin form.",

Balb/cJ mice were infected with the MHV-3 virus and treated with PBS, free ribavirin, or HRC 203. After treatment, mice were examined daily for effects on survival and clinical behavior. One mouse from the untreated group and 2 mice from both the ribavirin Table 1 ). In contrast, survival was enhanced in both ribavirin-and HRC 203-treated MHV-3-infected mice (Fig. 6A ).

By day 3, viral titers had risen to above the minimal detectable limit of the assay, although no significant difference between groups was observed (Fig. 6B) . By day 3, all PBS-treated MHV-3-infected mice died.

            "text": "The results from in vitro experiments on MHV-3infected macrophages support the use of hemoglobin targeted drug therapy in vivo. Viral replication in macrophages is a prerequisite for MHV-3 to gain access to the liver parenchymal cells. MHV-3 replication was reduced in macrophages treated with HRC 203, in contrast to macrophages treated with an approximately 20-fold higher dose of free ribavirin. This effect was not due to drug toxicity; macrophages incubated with either HRC 203 or ribavirin were viable as shown by exclusion of trypan blue. Free ribavirin produced no improvement in viral titers, compared with a 90% reduction in viral titers produced by HRC 203. Viral infection of macrophages also activates an immune cascade mediated by cytokine production. 25 The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 is increased in MHV-3-infected macrophages compared with uninfected macrophages. 25 The delivery of HRC 203 to macrophages via the hemoglobin-haptoglobin receptor, CD163, allows for direct targeting of anti-viral therapeutics to an important member of the innate immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated the increased expression of CD163 in the liver of patients with acute hepatitis compared with those with chronic hepatitis or non-infected individuals. 12 The increased presence of CD163 was attributed to the increased numbers of activated macrophages in the livers of affected individuals. 12 The benefit of targeting macrophages is supported by the demonstration of a significantly greater reduction in viral titers and a comparable reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines using a lower dose of drug in the conjugated form compared with that of free drug.",

            "text": "The results presented in this study also demonstrated an enhanced antiviral activity of HRC 203 in isolated mouse hepatocytes infected with the MHV-3 virus. Free ribavirin was ineffective at reducing viral replication at a dose of 1 mol/L. In contrast, when hepatocytes were incubated with the same concentration of drug in the form of HRC 203, a significant reduction in viral replication (78%) was observed. The dose of HRC 203 required to inhibit viral replication was 10 micromolar (mol/L) in isolated hepatocytes, whereas for similar viral inhibition in cultures of macrophages, a 40 mol/L concentration of ribavirin was required. Even at a concentration of 1 mol/L significant inhibition of viral growth was seen in isolated hepatocytes, whereas in macrophages at this concentration no inhibition was seen. 25 We do not have an explanation for this finding, but differences in binding of drug, intracellular processing, or rate of degradation of compound could account for these differences. The release of ribavirin monophosphate might explain the enhanced anti-viral activity in hepatocytes; however, the ribavirin released from HRC 203 has been shown to be free ribavirin and not the monophosphorylated form. 13 HRC 203 also inhibited the viral cytopathic effect (syncytia formation) of MHV-3, whereas free ribavirin did not. The effect was specific for HRC 203, because neither the Hb-Hp complex alone nor Hb-RV conjugate alone were inhibitory (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest a receptor-mediated process underlying the improved activity of HRC 203 compared with free drug. Although CD163 is not expressed on hepatocytes, hemoglobin and hemoglobin-haptoglobin have been shown to bind to hepatocytes in a receptor-mediated fashion, although the hepatocyte receptor has not been identified. 10, 31, 32 The effect of HRC 203 was also compared with free ribavirin in an in vivo model of viral hepatitis. MHV-3infected control mice all died within 4 days of infection of massive liver necrosis. HRC 203 and free ribavirin improved survival compared with untreated control, and HRC 203 treated mice exhibited improved clinical behavior whereas mice receiving free ribavirin showed symptoms consistent with drug toxicity or ongoing viral infection despite better histology in the free ribavirin group. In addition, HRC 203 maintained hematocrit values near baseline compared with a decreasing hematocrit observed in the free ribavirin group. Because the hemolytic effects of ribavirin normally occur only after 4 weeks or more of daily dosing in humans, 33 whether the apparent avoidance of this effect in the MHV-3-infected mice is directly related to this known toxicity of ribavirin is unknown. Nevertheless, although the exact mechanism for the beneficial effects of HRC 203 is not known, the data presented suggest that the coupling of ribavirin to hemoglobin improves the safety and efficacy of ribavirin by targeting the delivery of ribavirin to infected cells.",

In combination with the in vitro findings, the results presented here provide important proof-of-concept for the effectiveness of HRC 203 and the targeting of drug agents using hemoglobin. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting of ribavirin may allow for enhanced clinical and virologic benefit and set the stage for clinical trials designed to treat patients infected with hepatitis C. Although the results presented here do not suggest the identification of a new form of therapy for chronic hepatitis C, our data suggest that targeted delivery of ribavirin to macrophages and hepatocytes reduces many of the systemic side effects produced by free ribavirin. Therefore, sustained HRC 203 therapy could potentially alleviate systemic side effects such as hemolytic anemia that normally result in the premature cessation of ribavirin therapy.",
