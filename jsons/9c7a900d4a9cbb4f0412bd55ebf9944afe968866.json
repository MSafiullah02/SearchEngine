ICU beds remain incredibly important, but mainly due to their ability to provide immediate, lifesaving care-through clinicians trained in critical care and equipment, such as mechanical ventilators. These challenging times highlight that the traditional concept of a geographically isolated ICU may be less important than strategies to target resources to critically ill patients, wherever critical illness occurs. This concept of an \"ICU without walls\" is not new [2] , but it seeks to maximize opportunities to treat critically ill patients through ICU-convertible beds, flexible allocation of lifesaving resources, and expansion of the critical care specialty outside of the ICU and throughout the hospital.",

This tension-saving lives at great expense-underscores the need to carefully consider the ideal number of beds within an ICU. The decision to reduce the number of beds within an intensive care unit (ICU) can have major implications for patients, clinicians, and hospitals. Therefore, this decision is ideally made from a societal perspective (i.e., maximizing benefits and minimizing harms for an entire health care system).",

For instance, Bangladesh has less than one ICU bed per 100,000 citizens [3] . Insufficient ICU beds result in patients who might benefit from ICU care not receiving it [4] . In these constrained settings, it is difficult to suggest that less ICU beds are more. Instead, we might consider whether expansion of ICU care is the optimal investment for resource-limited health care systems. Rather than expanding ICU capacity, three alternative strategies may improve population health: enhancing primary care, regionalizing critical care, and improving advanced care planning. Each of these interventions may also indirectly reduce the number of ICU beds needed within a hospital.",

For example, one study revealed that ICU's with high bed availability were much more likely to admit patients who were either too sick or too healthy to benefit from ICU care than ICU's with limited bed availability [13] . The abundance of ICU beds has led to indiscriminate use of ICU care-where critically ill and non-critically ill patients are granted ICU access in a first-come, first-served model until ICU beds become limited.
