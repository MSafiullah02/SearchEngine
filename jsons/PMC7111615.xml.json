            "text": "Obstetric standards and published guidelines strongly recommend offering HIV testing to all pregnant women.19, 66 In some states, offering HIV testing to pregnant women is mandated by law. This allows women to become informed about HIV, receive care for their disease, and participate in decision making regarding mode of delivery and chemoprophylaxis to reduce the risk for the perinatal transmission of HIV. These women and their families should be counseled about the schedule of care visits; diagnostic testing for HIV; and chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine (ZDV) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u2013SMX), which are recommended for at-risk infants (Table 1)\n.2, 19 A DNA polymerase chain reaction for the detection of HIV is recommended before hospital discharge. Diagnostic tests for HIV in the infants detects 30% to 50% of infected infants at birth, with more than 95% diagnosed by 2 months of age, so physicians should follow up these infants closely during the first several months of life. Their mothers should be counseled against breast-feeding their infants because of the additional risk for transmission of HIV to infants.27, 65 At the authors' institution, the first postnatal visit is done at 14 days of life. At this visit, compliance with the ZDV regimen is assessed, dosing is adjusted as needed, and refills given to ensure that infants have a 6-week supply of ZDV. Also, feeding practices and nutrition are discussed. A complete blood count is recommended to monitor for hematologic toxicity, most commonly, anemia or leukopenia. If the HIV DNA PCR was not done at birth, it is performed at this visit. During the second visit, at 6 weeks of age, ZDV is discontinued if the HIV DNA PCR tests have been negative. At this visit, complete blood count, T-cell subsets, and DNA HIV PCR results are obtained. TMP\u2013SMX is begun at a dose of 150 mg/m2/dose given three times a week for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and the first set of immunizations is given. PCP prophylaxis is started empirically in at-risk infants less than 1 year of age, independent of the CD4+ cell count and percentage, because HIV status may be uncertain and, in infected infants with rapid progression of disease, CD4+ cell counts can decrease precipitously in the first months of life, predisposing to PCP.68, 74\n",

When an at-risk infant has had two negative HIV DNA PCR test results after 2 months of age and is clinically and immunologically normal, PCP prophylaxis is discontinued. These children are considered presumptively HIV negative, but an HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test is performed after 1 year of age to monitor for the disappearance of maternal antibody. If the HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot are negative, the ELISA test is repeated and, if the result is negative, the child is considered uninfected and a seroreverter. Because many infants are born to HIV-infected women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, physicians should carefully note drug exposure on these infants' charts and maintain follow-up on them as long as possible to determine any long-term effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to these drugs. Also, any congenital anomalies or unusual illnesses occurring in these infants should be reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (phone 800-722-9292, ext. 38465).",

Two immunosuppressed children cared for at the authors' institution had delayed healing of the tissue around the gastrostomy site and required months of supportive therapy until it finally closed spontaneously. The authors recommend starting with 8-hour to 12-hour infusions of formula overnight at low rates and slowly increasing the volume.

In some cases, the thrombocytopenia has responded to the initiation or change of antiretroviral therapy. ZDV has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia.38 The role of other antiretroviral agents is less clear. When the platelet count is less than 20,000 platelets/mL or when bleeding is present, treatment should be instituted. Platelets are short-lived cells, and transfused platelets have even a shorter life span. The use of platelet transfusions is reserved for patients who are actively bleeding. IVIG has been beneficial in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. A total of 2 g/kg is administered over 2 to 4 days. If a response to the IVIG occurs, then this is given at 3-week or 4-week intervals.10, 74 If a patient has maintained a normal platelet count for 6 to 12 months, the interval between doses is increased, and the treatment is eventually discontinued. RHo(D) immune globulin intravenous (WinRho SDF) is an alternative to IVIG, but hemolysis may result and is a significant side effect. Corticosteroids are another alternative treatment. Prednisone is usually started at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d for 2 to 4 weeks and then tapered and discontinued, but the thrombocytopenia may relapse when the steroids have been discontinued. Interferon alfa is reported to be effective in patients with severe thrombocytopenia that is resistant to antiretroviral therapy. Splenectomy is an option to consider if other treatments fail and usually results in the resolution of thrombocytopenia, but the lack of a spleen will predispose these children to encapsulated bacterial infections.55, 64 If splenectomy is considered, these children should be immunized with pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and meningococcal vaccines. A new approach is the use of recombinant thrombopoietin. Harker et al35 experimentally treated three chimpanzees infected with HIV and thrombocytopenia with pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor. The chimpanzees had a tenfold increase in platelet number, 30-fold increase in marrow megakaryocyte numbers, and fourfold increase in marrow megakaryocyte progenitor cells. On the other hand, Cole et al23 found that thrombocytopenia in HIV-infected patients was caused by a shortening of platelet life span, increased splenic sequestration, and ineffective delivery of viable platelets and that levels of thrombopoietin were significantly higher than in control subjects.23 The eventual role of this agent in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in children or adults infected with HIV is unclear.",

In more severe cases, significant clubbing occurs. In asymptomatic children with LIP and normal oxygen saturation, a chest radiograph should be obtained at least once a year, and the oxygen saturation should be monitored using pulse oxymetry at each clinic visit. If a patient is hypoxic, steroids are indicated. Prednisone is given at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d for 2 to 4 weeks, with subsequent tapering to 1 mg/kg/d, and therapy is continued until the oxygen saturation becomes normal. Most children respond to this treatment within the first few weeks. In general, when an adequate response has occurred, the steroids may be weaned and discontinued. In some cases, repeated courses of steroids may be warranted. A few children with severe, advanced lung disease may not respond to steroid therapy, and if no response occurs after 4 to 6 months, the steroids should be discontinued. In addition, bronchodilators and chest physical therapy are helpful adjunctive therapies. The use of low doses of diuretics may also improve the respiratory status.72\n",

When possible, the treatment should be directed to the specific pathogen causing the infection. Treatment is usually empiric because noninvasive diagnostic procedures, such as blood and sputum cultures, yield an organism in approximately 30% of cases. Therapy is directed at the usual pathogens (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus), but in patients with chronic lung disease, gram-negative organisms, especially P. aeruginosa, must be considered potential pathogens. The authors have had good experience with the combination ticarcillin-clavulanic acid. The addition of aminoglycosides should be considered in immunocompromised patients and in those infected with resistant strains of gram-negative rods. Aminoglycosides can be delivered by nebulization (tobramycin, 80\u2013160 mg three times a day) to decrease the risk for nephrotoxicity and improve delivery to the affected area. If a patient does not improve or his or her condition deteriorates on treatment, a bronchoalveolar lavage is indicated for diagnosis. The length of therapy is dependent on the cause and severity of the illness. Although the authors usually recommend 10 to 14 days of systemic antibiotic therapy, some children benefit from a longer course of treatment. In patients with chronic lung disease, pulmonary function tests may be beneficial at the onset of treatment and can be used as an indicator for length of therapy. If the pulmonary function tests continue to improve after 14 days of antibiotic therapy, treatment is continued until a return to baseline or a new plateau is reached.",

Initial testing should include chest radiography and ECG. Chest radiography is useful in evaluating heart size and the presence of pulmonary disease (e.g., LIP, pneumonia, or pleural effusions) and other intrathoracic abnormalities. When patients are examined by ECG or during autopsy, cardiac abnormalities are detected more often than expected from physical examination. This raises the question of whether an ECG should be part of the routine examination of HIV-infected children, especially those with low CD4+ cell counts. Lipshultz52 prospectively followed up 196 HIV-infected children with baseline ECG at enrollment and every 4 months thereafter for 2 years. He found that subclinical cardiac abnormalities were not only common but also persistent and often progressive. Similar data are available on HIV-infected adults. Although introducing ECG as part of the routine care of HIV-infected children implies a significant cost and an additional workload, a periodic ECG assessment may be beneficial. Some centers recommend annual ECG for asymptomatic patients and every 8 months for symptomatic patients.60 Other tests used in the assessment of cardiomyopathy include Holter monitoring and, rarely, cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy.",

In areas where a high prevalence of measles exists, monovalent measles vaccine is given between 6 and 12 months of age. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, children with HIV who developed measles infection had a high risk for complications and death, suggesting that the benefits of administering this live viral vaccine outweighed the potential risks, but in one case report, a 21-year-old hemophiliac man infected with HIV was immunized with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, giant cell pneumonia developed 1 year later, and the patient died.17 The measles vaccine virus was isolated from postmortem specimens. Since this report, recommendations have been altered, and children with mild or moderate immunosuppression (i.e., immune category 1 or 2) should receive the measles vaccine, but children with severe immunosuppression (i.e., immune category 3) should be excluded. Whether a child with severe immunosuppression who responds to HAART with an increase in the CD4+ T-cell count and percentage corresponding to immune category 1 or 2 should be immunized with measles vaccine is a matter of controversy. At this time, the functional capacity of the CD4+ T cells that have been restored is uncertain. Until a reliable, quantitative test is available to define the function of these restored cells, immunization with the measles vaccine is not recommended in these situations. Also, the antibody response to measles vaccination in HIV-infected children may vary in amount and duration, depending on the clinical and immune status of these children, so in the case of exposure to measles, HIV-infected children should receive prophylaxis with immunoglobulin, preferably within 72 hours after exposure. The dose recommended for children with symptomatic HIV infection is 0.5 mL/kg (maximum dose, 15 mL) and for asymptomatic children is 0.25 mL/kg, given intramuscularly. Children who have received IVIG therapy within 3 weeks of exposure do not need additional prophylaxis.",

Children less than 9 years of age who have not been immunized previously should receive two doses of the vaccine given 1 month apart. For children previously immunized with this vaccine, one dose is adequate. Physicians should review the official recommendations for influenza vaccine yearly because the composition of the vaccine varies and the dosage for children aged 3 years or less may be different than for older children. The vaccine should be given in early autumn, before the onset of the flu season. In addition, household contacts of high-risk children should also be immunized.",

In children with severe immunocompromization, recurrent herpes zoster virus or chronic varicella infection may develop. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not recommend administering the varicella vaccine to persons with cellular immune deficiencies, but because of the increased risk for morbidity from varicella and herpes zoster, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that the varicella vaccine be considered for children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection, CDC classification N1 or A1, with an age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage of 25% or more.20 The vaccine should be administered in two doses with a 3-month interval between doses for this group of children. This schedule differs from the vaccination schedule for healthy children. It is strongly recommended for HIV-negative siblings and children living in households with HIV-infected adults or children, but this vaccine should not be administered to children with HIV infection who have moderate or severe immunocompromization. Studies to evaluate the safety and tolerance of this vaccine in HIV-infected children are ongoing. In a study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the Oka strain varicella vaccine, 42 HIV-infected children aged 1 to 8 years (stage N1 and A1) who had no history of varicella infection and had negative titers received two doses of the vaccine separated by 3 months. No severe adverse effects were reported. Fever occurred in 20% of the recipients after the first dose and in 5% after the second dose. Local reactions were similar to those seen in healthy children. After eight exposures, only one mild case of varicella occurred. Varicella-zoster virus antibody and specific lymphocyte proliferation were respectively detected in 48% and 63% of patients after the first and 56% and 82% of patients after the second dose.50 Susceptible children with HIV infection exposed to varicella should receive passive immunization with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin given within 96 hours of exposure. If a child has received IVIG within the 3 weeks before exposure, then varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is not necessary.",

As children enter late childhood and adolescence, they should be aware of their diagnoses. Children with other chronic diseases who know their diagnoses have been shown to cope better with their illness than those who do not know their diagnoses. In past years, families have been afraid to tell their children about their HIV infection because of the fear that these children will disclose to others and the family would be stigmatized or because of denial or guilt about transmitting the infection to their children, but an ongoing dialogue with the family regarding the importance of disclosure is important. The age, maturity, and social circumstance of these children must be taken into consideration, and disclosure should be done in a language and at a level that these children understand. Neuropsychological testing can guide the practitioner in determining the developmental age of a child. Simple, uncomplicated explanations can be given to children under 10 years of age, but older children and adolescents should have full disclosure, conveying an understanding of how the infection is transmitted, how to protect others from getting the infection, and a sense of responsibility for their health. These children should become active participants in their health care. As children reach adolescence, issues of compliance arise, and teenagers should be able to express opinions on the type of medication regimen they can accommodate, with full realization of the consequences of not taking their medication. Disclosure may occur through the family or guardian of the child or with assistance of the physician and the social worker. The counseling session should include a discussion of who must or should know about the diagnosis. The authors encourage telling siblings who are mature enough to handle the responsibility of knowing this information so that they can be supportive of the infected child. Physicians should answer questions openly and truthfully to prevent misconceptions about the illness. At each subsequent visit, physicians should allow the children to ask questions regarding the diagnosis. After disclosure, the children should be given the opportunity to speak with another infected child or attend a peer support group so they do not feel isolated.3, 54\n",

The number of children reported with AIDS in the United States is decreasing, and efforts are shifting from caring for children with advanced immunosuppression and severe opportunistic infections to early HAART, maintenance of the immune system, and prevention of opportunistic infections. Primary care physicians are now more involved and informed in the care of HIV-infected patients. Although published data are limited, physicians who have been working with this population have observed a dramatic improvement in the quality of life and length of survival of these patients. Unfortunately, this progress is not shared by developing countries where resources are minimal and antiretroviral agents are commonly unavailable.
