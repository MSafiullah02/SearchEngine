The Children's Cancer Group 3891 study demonstrated superior 3 year EFS in children with high-risk neuroblastoma randomized to autologous BMT.15 In order to extend this concept, we have been using a strategy of tandem PBSCT to allow further dose intensification. Although this approach has produced a promising 3-year EFS of 56% and an overall treatment-related mortality similar to single transplant studies,16,17 our experience here suggests that the treatment is highly immunosuppressive. We have experienced an overall incidence of severe EBV complications including LPD of 3.2% in our experience with tandem PBSCT for high-risk pediatric solid tumors. All EBV cases occurred in children who had received CD34+ PBSC, for an incidence of 4.6% in the CD34 selected group.",

B lymphocytes preferentially maintain EBV genome in a nonreplicating, latent form.18 In the normal host, primary infection results in a transient lymphoproliferative disorder commonly known as infectious mononucleosis. The immune response to EBV is both humoral and cellular. The humoral response is useful for the diagnosis of EBV initial infection and antibodies to EBV proteins have neutralizing properties. These antibodies may also render infected individuals immune to further infection with exogenously transmitted virus, although this is likely aided by further cellular immune-mediated responses as well.19,20 Control of EBV-infected B-cell proliferation is largely mediated through natural killer, CD4+, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.21 After recovery, HLA-restricted cytotoxic T cells play an important role in controlling EBV reactivation.22 Cytotoxic T cells undergo antigen-driven polyclonal expansion of up to 30% of cells. Resting memory B cells form the reservoir through which the virus persists throughout life in its host. In the immunocompromised host, suppression by cytotoxic lymphocytes is hampered or unavailable, leading to unchecked replication of B lymphocytes. This replication can behave in a malignant fashion, either leading to invasive polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia or to a monoclonal proliferation of lymphomatous B cells.23",

Consistent with the prevailing risk factors listed above, our finding that all the five of our patients who have EBV-LPD received CD34 selected grafts suggests that depth of immune suppression is indeed important. Previous attempts to predict EBV-LPD by measuring total EBV-DNA in peripheral blood have been shown to have a predictive value of about 40%. Meij et al have recently described 25 patients who received partially T-cell depleted SCTs and subsequently developed high EBV-DNA loads. Of these patients, all of those who developed high levels of EBV-DNA prior to the recovery of EBV-specific T cells ultimately developed LPD. For them, this resulted in an increase to a predictive value of 100% for this subset of patients.35 Although their findings need to be replicated, these results may ultimately have defined those patients who need to be followed most closely for EBV-LPD. Further, they suggest the importance of future investigation into the role of T-cell re-infusion for those patients at highest risk of LPD.",

In general, the incidence of EBV-LPD after autologous transplantation is very low. Our observation of five cases of EBV-LPD suggests that there may be a threshold of treatment intensity that may result in significant enough immunosuppression to increase the risk of this complication. Each component of these highly dose-intensified protocols: induction chemotherapy employing high doses of cyclophosphamide, multiple cycle high-dose chemotherapy with PBSC rescue, and use of CD34+ PBSC, may add to immune suppression and, thus, the EBV-LPD risk.",

Our experience suggests that early diagnosis followed by prompt initiation of rituximab therapy may successfully manage EBV-LPD. The current Children's Oncology Group phase III study A3973 will answer the question of whether purging tumor cells from PBSC products impacts the outcome in children with neuroblastoma. If purging does improve EFS, then the use of CD34 selection in the setting of tandem PBSCT may best be pursued with strategies to improve immune reconstitution, such as a plan to return T cells to the patient.40",
