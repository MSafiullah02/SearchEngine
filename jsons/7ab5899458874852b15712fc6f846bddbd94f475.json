The Saudi Arabian Government continuously reviews global threats and strengthens surveillance systems operating at the Hajj. 34 Meanwhile promotion of appropriate personal protection measures, such as face masks, personal hygiene measures, 23, 30, [35] [36] [37] and travel-related vaccines should remain a priority.",
