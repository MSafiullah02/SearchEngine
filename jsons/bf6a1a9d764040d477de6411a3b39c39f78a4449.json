This feature is related to the polycistronic nature of their genome, which contains up to 12 open reading frames and, in particular, to the polyprotein strategy used to produce the large viral replicase/transcriptase, the complex set of nonstructural proteins that is responsible for replication and transcription of the nidovirus genome [see (1) and the references therein]. In coronaviruses (Fig. 1) , the larger of the two replicase polyproteins (pp1ab) can be more than 7000 amino acids long and is processed into 15 or 16 cleavage products, now commonly referred to as nonstructural protein (nsp) 1 to 16 (2,3) . In arteriviruses, despite their much smaller replicase size (pp1ab is \"only\" \u223c3100 to 3900 amino acids), the complexity is not very different and replicase processing yields 13 or 14 cleavage products. The regulated autoproteolysis of nidovirus replicase pp1a and pp1ab is driven by two to four proteinases that reside in the ORF1a-encoded part of the replicase. Cleavage sites for coronavirus and arterivirus proteinases have been identified for several prototypic nidoviruses through a combination of theoretical and experimental methods and can now be confidently predicted for other members of these virus groups.",

It should be noted that intermediates of replicase polyprotein processing, which have been described for various nidoviruses, are not taken into consideration in this count and are likely to even further increase the repertoire of viral polypeptides produced in infected cells. Replicase precursors and processing intermediates in fact complicate certain types of analyses, such as those that rely on microscopy, since antibodies will usually not discriminate among precursors, intermediates, and processing end products.

This complex is involved in genome replication and the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs, which are required to express the genes in the 3 -proximal third of the genome. Translation of the smallest subgenomic mRNA yields the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) that assembles into new nucleocapsid (NC) structures together with newly generated genome RNA. Other subgenomic mRNAs encode viral envelope proteins that are (largely co-translationally) inserted into membranes of the host cell ' the target protein has to be studied against a background of a large number of other proteins, either in whole fixed cells or in cell lysates, specific antibodies can provide a rapid and reliable method for discriminating signal from noise.

The production of antigens in E. coli are not covered in any detail in this chapter and the reader is referred to the extensive literature on this topic published elsewhere (and in Chapter 13 in this volume). E. coli allows for the cheap production of large amounts of antigen, but clearly such antigens have to be purified prior to use for immunization. This can be facilitated, e.g., by the use of a variety of tags (such as fusion to glutathione-S-transferase, maltose-binding protein, or the commonly used hexahistidine tag) for which convenient affinity resins are available. Reasonably pure antigens (>80% pure) are required and in the case of larger tags one should consider removing the tag proteolytically to ensure that the immune response will be directed against the target rather than against its tag. If the E. coli expression product turns out to be insoluble, which will usually interfere with its straightforward affinity purification, it may still be possible to purify a reasonably pure protein sample from inclusion bodies by repeated extraction of this material with increasing concentrations of urea (or guanidium isothiocyanate). As long as small amounts of this material can be used (i.e., the protein concentration is sufficiently high), after washing of the protein pellets with PBS, such urea-containing samples can be used for mixing with the adjuvant and immunization without the need for dialysis.",

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) are the two most commonly used carrier proteins. We have always relied on BSA (a very soluble and stable plasma protein) and a coupling reaction using glutaraldehyde, which links the amino groups of carrier and synthetic peptide (in lysine residues and at the amino terminus of the peptide). For example, crosslinking at lysine residues can be represented as: Note that the above calculations are based on a number of assumptions and should be considered as a rule of thumb. Clearly, since the sequence is known, the Mr of the peptide can be calculated more precisely. However, since we usually add extra lysines to the peptide there will be different ways in which it can be coupled to the carrier and a variety of complexes will be formed (BSA \"trees\" with a varying number of peptide \"branches\" scattered all over the backbone), presenting the epitope in many different ways. 3 . To the peptide-BSA mixture, add PBS to give a final volume of 670 l; then (carefully, slowly, and while mixing) add 330 l of a freshly prepared 0.3% glutaraldehyde solution (equaling approximately 10 mol). 4. Incubate the coupling reaction on a roller device at room temperature for 1 h to allow cross-linking of peptide and carrier protein. 5. Add 200 l of 1-M glycine in order to quench the remaining free glutaraldehyde and continue rolling for 1 h. 6. Dialyze the coupling reaction overnight against PBS to remove small molecules such as uncoupled peptide, glycine, and glycine-glutaraldehyde. Dialyze two or three times against at least 500 volumes of PBS at 4 \u2022 C. The final step can be overnight.

Freund's adjuvants have been used in our studies; Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) for the initial immunization and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FICA) for subsequent booster immunizations. FCA (but not FICA) contains heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium butyricum (or extracts thereof), which stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity. The water-in-oil emulsion that is the basis for FCA guarantees the slow release of the antigen from the site of immunization, but it should be noted that the mineral oil component is quite toxic and induces granulomatous reactions. Mix FCA/FICA with the antigen-containing solution to form a \"toothpaste-like\" stable emulsion. See below for details. In our standard protocol, \u223c200 g of antigen (peptide-BSA complex) is used for the primary immunization, and the same amount for subsequent booster reactions. 1 . Before use, mix the FCA, e.g., gently on a roller device to get the bacteria into suspension. For the primary immunization, the antigen (200-250 g) is diluted with PBS to give a final volume of 0.8 ml PBS, which is mixed with 0.4 ml of FCA. Transfer this mixture to a 3-ml syringe (luer-lock). Use a P1000 micropipette; put the tip in the opening of the syringe, and slowly pull the plunger back. In the same manner, fill a second syringe with 0.4 ml of FCA and 0.4 ml of air (to promote the formation of the emulsion). 2. Connect the two syringes with a three-way stopcock (Fig. 3) . Mix the contents of the two syringes until a thick, white emulsion is obtained. This means that the suspension is converted into an oily mass that includes the water. This emulsion, when properly prepared, is stable and will not disperse when a droplet is put into PBS. The emulsion will ensure the slow release of the antigen into the animal. 3. Disconnect the syringes and use the antigen suspension the same day. Optionally, the syringes can be stored for later use, overnight at 4 \u2022 C or for longer periods at -80 \u2022 C. 4. For booster immunizations FICA is used instead of FCA. Material for two boosts can be prepared in one action by doubling the volumes above.

In fact, the level of denaturation in IP experiments can be easily influenced by varying the percentage of SDS in the IP buffer. Often, IPs with antisera raised using synthetic peptides work better in the presence of relatively high (0.25-0.5%) concentrations of SDS, probably because the epitope in the denatured target resembles the antigen used for immunization more closely under these conditions.

Conversely, sera that are negative in IF may still be highly reactive in WB and/or denaturing IP. Consequently, it is important to test new antisera in at least two of these three assays. In our daily practice, we have usually relied on IF for preliminary screening and WB for confirmation. There is an additional reason to confirm the IF results by subsequent WB or IP analysis: in IF assays antisera can sometimes show a strong reaction with cellular proteins (Fig. 4) , either-at low dilutions-because of the lack of a specific response against the target or-at higher dilutions-because of an unexpected cross-reactivity CoV nsp3 (4) , which was very specific in Vero-E6 cells (see Fig. 5 ), resulting in a strong, punctate nuclear labeling in BHK-21 cells that expressed the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV. (D) SARS-CoV-infected cells labeled several weeks after fixation and embedded using ProLong mounting fluid. An aspecific nucleolar background labeling was observed, especially in the green range of the fluorescence spectrum. The specific, much brighter signal is derived from an anti-nsp3 labeling using a rabbit antiserum that was directly coupled to Alexa Fluor-488 (4). with cellular proteins. WB or IP analysis provides important information about the molecular mass of the target that is recognized, and may thus prevent premature conclusions about the specificity of the antiserum. The correct assessment of specificity is also aided by the inclusion of two important controls: the preimmunization serum (which should obviously not show the same signal) and mock-infected control cells (which might reveal that it is in fact a cellular target that is being recognized). When performing initial screening with IF assays, it is practical to use cell cultures that have been infected at an MOI of 0.5-1 and therefore contain a mixture of virus-infected and mock-infected cells in the same specimen.",

(Routinely, our peptide synthesis yields about 5 mg of product, of which \u223c4 mg is the peptide and the remainder consists of salts). Weigh the dry peptide on a piece of paper and carefully split it with a scalpel (wear gloves). For a solution of \u223c5 mg/ml, dissolve about half of the peptide in a final volume of 0.4 ml of PBS. Solubility in PBS is usually good if the freeze-dried product looks \"large and fluffy.\" If it looks small and granular, it may be better to first dissolve the peptide in a small volume of DMSO and then dilute this solution in PBS. The final concentration of DMSO should be less than 5%. 2. Add BSA (the carrier protein) to the peptide solution at the correct molar ratio.The aim is to couple one peptide per about 50 amino acids of carrier protein, for about 12 peptides per BSA molecule. The amount of peptide can be estimated with the following formula, which assumes an average molecular mass (Mr) of 110 Da per amino acid: (volume)*(concentration)/(x-mer*110), or-in a 21 mer example-(0.4 ml)*(5 mg/ml)/(21*110 g/mol) = 0.86 mole. Calculate the required amount of BSA, which is 618 amino acids long (including 59 lysine residues) and thus weighs \u223c68 mg/mol. Mixing peptide and BSA at a molar ratio of 12:1 means that in our example using 0.86 mol of peptide, we would use 0.86/12 = 0.072 mol of BSA (or 4.9 mg, or 98 l of a 50-mg/ml solution).",
