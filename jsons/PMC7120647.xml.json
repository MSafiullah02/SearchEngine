            "text": "Ricardian land-use models have become popular for determining the costs or benefits from climate change. Ricardian analysis simply assumes that landowners will use land in its best alternative, thereby maximizing the available rent. Observed land values reflect the fact that land rents diverge as a result of different growing conditions, soil characteristics, nearness to shipping points, and so on. Since producers face nearly the same output price, differences in land prices are the result of differences in the Ricardian or differential rents, which, in turn, are attributable to the various factors affecting production. Thus, marginal agricultural land that is used for extensive grazing has much lower rent than land that is intensively cropped.",

            "text": "The idea is illustrated with the aid of Fig. 7.1, where three land uses are considered and the factor determining differential or Ricardian rent is precipitation. When annual precipitation is low, the land can only support livestock, but, as precipitation increases, the rangeland yields increasingly higher rents because more forage can be produced. When annual precipitation increases beyond P1 (associated with point A), crop production is the alternative land use that provides the highest rents. To the right of A, landowners will cultivate land and grow crops to achieve higher net returns to the land. Rents to crop production are even higher on land parcels that experience more rainfall. If too much rain falls, however, the land yields a greater rent in forestry \u2013 beyond P2 (point B) rents in crop production are lower than those when the same land is in forestry. Points A and B represent intensive margins, precipitation thresholds where land use changes, while \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent extensive margins for land uses crop production and forestry, respectively, because rent to those land uses falls below zero if precipitation is below those thresholds.\n",

The climate and control variables constitute the explanatory variables or regressors. Once the model parameters have been estimated for a sample of farms for which actual sales data are available, the results are first used to predict the farmland values across the entire study region or country. Then the climate variables are changed to reflect the projected change in climate, and the model parameters are again used to predict the farmland values for the entire region/country. (The control variables and the estimated model parameters remain the same in the current and changed climate states of the world.) The model implicitly assumes that, if landowners face different climate conditions, they will choose the agricultural land use (crop and technique) that maximizes their net returns. The differences between farmland values in the current climate state and the projected future climate regime constitute the costs (if overall values fall) or benefits (if overall farmland values rise) of climate change.",

However, forestlands are often ignored because there is little information on private forestland prices (much is owned by institutional investors) or the forestland is owned by the government and no price data are available. Further, there is no reason to suppose that the estimated parameters will continue to hold under a changed climate regime, which might be the case if growing conditions under a future climate regime are outside observed values (which increases uncertainty of predicted values); it is also difficult to use hedonic models estimated for a current period to project how the same land might be used some 50\u2013100 years later. Ricardian models do not take into account technological and economic changes that might occur, nor can they be expected to do so. But they also fail to take into account the fertilizer impact of CO2, which is discussed below. Despite these flaws, the Ricardian method is one of the few statistical approaches that can be used to determine potential damages from global warming, and it is solidly rooted in economic theory.",

An economic objective function is specified and then optimized subject to various economic, social, climate and technical constraints, with the latter two representing the production technology. The objective function might constitute net returns to landowners, the utility (wellbeing) of the citizens in the study region, or, most often, the sum of producers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 surpluses. The choice of an objective function depends on the purpose of the analysis, the size of the study (whether country, region or worldwide level) and the number of sectors included. The numbers and types of constraints also depend on the size of the model and its purpose (multi-region models with as many as 100,000 or even more constraints are not unusual), but somewhere (usually in the production constraints) climate factors are a driver. Models are calibrated to the current land uses and other conditions (e.g., trade flows) using a method such as positive mathematical programming, which employs economic theory to find calibrating cost functions (Howitt 1995, 2005).5 Models are solved numerically using a software environment such as GAMS (McCarl et al. 2007).",

This is the idea behind integrated assessment models. Most models of land use in agriculture and forestry are static, although the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (FASOM) is an exception (Adams et al. 1996). It optimizes the discounted sum of producers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 surpluses across forestry and agriculture, determines optimal harvest times of commercial timber, permits reallocation of land between the agricultural and forest sectors over time, and takes into account carbon uptake and release. To keep things manageable, it employs a 10-year time step. The impact of climate change is not modeled, per se, as FASOM is primarily used for policy to determine how carbon penalties and subsidies might affect the allocation of land use within and between the two primary sectors. The primary limitation of FASOM is that it only applies to the forestry and agricultural sectors of the United States, ignoring climate impacts in other countries that may affect U.S. prices.",

The introduction of invasive species has also posed an enormous threat to many indigenous species, even causing some to disappear because they cannot compete. These three factors are a greater threat to wildlife populations than global warming. Yet, many wildlife species are extremely resilient, surviving and sometimes even flourishing when temperatures warm.

If the pace of ecosystem change is slow, many species will be able to survive, migrating with the ecosystem itself or adapting to new conditions.

However, in a retraction (Siddall et al. 2010), they point out that, as a result of unforeseen errors related to the size of their time step for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and failure to account for the rise in temperatures consequent upon coming out of the Little Ice Age, the projected increases in sea level for the period to 2100 are overstated (although their simulations for the remaining periods remain valid).",

However, there is no evidence that the WAIS collapsed in the past 420,000 years, despite temperatures that were significantly higher than any experienced in human history, and there is no scientific basis to fear that a collapse of this ice sheet is imminent as a result of projected global warming (Idso and Singer 2009).

Further, these extreme weather events also disrupted the leveling of equipment. As a result, readings from years characterized by cyclones and tsunamis, and until the equipment could be tested and recalibrated, affected the calculation of trends.

Numbers rose during the 1920s and 1930s, only to level off until 1995, when storms appeared to increase rapidly for some 10 years, and then begin to fall to the end of the record (2009); the number of storms in the Atlantic appears to track increases in global temperatures for at least part of the record, as can be seen by comparing the dark line in Fig. 7.3 with the 10-year moving average of global temperatures in Fig. 10.1007/978-94-007-4988-7_2. A similar pattern is observed for the number of storms striking the U.S. or, at least, coming within 50 nautical miles of the coast, and thus having some, perhaps only minor, impact.

The results are provided in Table 7.3 for two regression models. If Atlantic and Pacific storms are considered to be related because of common factors, such as an El Ni\u00f1o, this is taken into account by estimating the two storm equations simultaneously, assuming that the error terms are correlated (see Greene 2008). In that case, we can only use 61 of the 159 annual observations for the North Atlantic because there are only 61 annual observations of storms in the Pacific. We also employ an independent, single-equation linear regression model for each of the Atlantic and Pacific storms. Notice that, when the equations are estimated simultaneously, the estimated coefficients do not change, but their estimated standard errors (provided in parentheses) are smaller, indicating a higher level of confidence in the estimated value (as evidenced by a lower probability in the square brackets).\n",

Further, even though the model is appropriate (as determined by the goodness of fit statistics), it explains less than 15% of the variation in storm activity for the period 1949\u20132009 and less than 23% for the period 1851\u20132009.

However, as elsewhere, people whose death is attributable to heat are generally the elderly and weak, who are more than likely to have died from other causes in the following months. This is not to deny the value of their lives, only that exceptionally warm weather may simply have been a factor triggering a mortality that was inevitable within the next several months. This hypothesis can be verified empirically by comparing incidents of death among various age categories before, during and after a period of exceptional heat. The same is true of cold periods. By controlling for access to central heating, air conditioning, age, health status, and other non-climate factors, it is possible to determine the effect that climate (unusual cold or heat) has on mortality.",

Extreme temperatures ranked sixth out of seven weather-related events as a contributor to mortality. For the period 1990 through 2006, death rates from all weather-related causes dropped dramatically as nations learned how to cope with severe weather events and as a result of relief efforts by rich countries. Annual mortality from drought and floods fell significantly, while it rose for the other five weather events; however, annual death rates fell for all categories, with the exception of extreme temperature events. Global average annual death rates fell by some 7\u201399 %, but rose by several 100 % in the case of extreme weather events.\n\n",

Second, and perhaps more important, the authors neglect the fact that temperatures in a given year, or even over a decade, may not be representative of the actual temperatures that the country/region has historically experienced and might experience in the future. Climate is not the same as weather, nor is climate variability the same as weather variability. Average temperature in any given year may be an anomaly, as may the change in average annual temperatures over any 5- or 10-year interval. Further, for many regions, it is not the average annual temperature that is most important. Regions that experience large differences between summer and winter temperatures incur higher costs from such things as increased road and other infrastructural repairs plus heating/cooling needs. Finally, there is no causal mechanism, precipitation is ignored, and amenity values are neglected. In particular, citizens in some countries might simply desire warmer and drier weather.",

Relative to business-as-usual (BAU) CO2 emissions, the optimal strategy is to reduce emissions immediately by 35\u201340 % followed by further reductions to nearly 50% of BAU emissions by 2100 and to a peak of 63% by 2200, followed by a tapering off (Cline 2004). The associated optimal carbon tax starts in 2000 at $35 (in 1990 dollars) per ton of CO2 (t CO2) rises to $46/tCO2 in 2005, to $67/tCO2 by 2025, to $100/tCO2 by 2050, and to a peak of $355/tCO2 in 2200 before declining. Cline (2004) also investigates the Kyoto Protocol (assuming it remains in place in perpetuity) and a value-at-risk scenario that identifies the maximum expected loss over the time horizon up to a probability of 95%; that is, the value-at-risk scenario determines the optimal carbon tax required to reduce the chance of a maximum possible loss to 5% or less.

(7.3) that is calibrated to take into account estimates of damages and benefits from global warming found in the literature. For example, agricultural economists had found that (some) warming was actually beneficial for agricultural production (Darwin et al. 1995; Mendelsohn et al. 2000; Mendelsohn et al. 1994; Tol),32 but such benefits appear to be outweighed by losses elsewhere (Nordhaus 2007a). Three scenarios of projected damages from different calibrations of the power function used by Nordhaus are provided in Table 7.7. It is important to note that these are calibrations and not statistical evidence, so they really amount to nothing more than an assumed relation between temperature increase and economic damages that is based on projections of possible damages made by researchers examining specific sectors such as agriculture.

(2010) link adaptation, mitigation and climate change damage in an integrated assessment model of the world economy and the energy and climate systems. They find that an optimal combination of adaptation policies (reactive and anticipatory, plus investment in R&D) and mitigation would see no more than 20% of emissions abated over the period to 2100, while expenditures on adaptation would rise rapidly beginning in 2060. Depending on the discount rate and perceptions of future damage, the combination of mitigation and adaptation would account for between 44 and 73% of total damages (the remainder simply borne by the economy), while the proportion dealt with by adaptation would vary from a low of 20% (equal to that borne via mitigation) to 53% (with mitigation only addressing 9% of damages).",

For example, one might not want to lock into the internal combustion engine by promoting and subsidizing production of ethanol and biodiesel, with its production facilities and transportation networks, in case a much better option, such as an electric vehicle capable of going 300 km or more on a single charge, should come along.

His approach is not based on low discount rates and optimistic estimates of mitigation costs (Weitzman 2009a, b, c), but is still rooted in cost-benefit analysis. Weitzman considers what happens when there is a high probability of a catastrophic event. Weitzman bases his case on \u2018fat-tailed\u2019 probability density functions that, using his methods (discussed below), provide a 5% probability that average global temperatures rise by more than 10\u00b0C and a 1% probability that they increase by more than 20\u00b0C.

How does Weitzman come to this conclusion? He bases this on four exhibits (Weitzman 2009b, c):\nAccording to Antarctic ice core data reported by Dieter et al. (2008), current atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are the highest ever recorded in the past perhaps 850,000 years, and the current rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 is historically unprecedented. This unprecedented increase can only be attributed to human causes according to Weitzman and others.There are 22 studies reported in Table 9.3 and Box 10.2 of the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC WGI 2007, pp.721\u2013722, pp.798\u2013799). These studies report probability density functions (PDFs) with high probabilities of large temperature rise. Weitzman sums the reported PDFs into a single PDF using what he calls a meta-analysis based on Bayesian model averaging. From the meta-derived single PDF, Weitzman finds that the probability that the temperature increase exceeds 7\u00b0C is 5%, or that P(s*  \u2265  7\u00b0C)  =  P(\u0394T  \u2265  7\u00b0C)  =  0.05, and P(\u0394T  \u2265  10\u00b0C)  =  0.01. This is the feedback effect of CO2 warming on water vapor discussed earlier.Next, he assumes that the higher temperatures brought about by increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will cause permafrost and boggy soils to release methane, thereby amplifying global warming beyond even the water vapor feedback. The possibility that this feedback effect takes place is discussed by Scheffer et al. (2006), Matthews and Keith (2007)), and The Economist (1 August 2009, p.70).36 The possibility of such a feedback effect leads Weitzman to increase the value of the climate scaling multiplier s\nm so that, based on information from Torn and Harte (2006), the probability that temperatures could rise above 11.5\u00b0C is 5% and that they could rise above 22.6\u00b0C is 1%, or P(s\nm  \u2265  11.5\u00b0C)  =  P(\u0394T  \u2265  11.5\u00b0C)  =  5% and P(s\nm  \u2265  22.6\u00b0C)  =  P(\u0394T  \u2265  22.6\u00b0C)  =  1%. However, recognizing the crude and speculative nature of his calculations, Weitzman rounds this down: there is a 5% probability that the expected increase in temperature exceeds 10\u00b0C and a 1% probability that it exceeds 20\u00b0C \u2013 that is, P(\u0394T  \u2265  10\u00b0C)  =  5% and P(\u0394T  \u2265  20\u00b0C)  =  1%.Finally, given the potential for huge increases in temperature, Weitzman argues that economic damage (utility) functions parameterized on the basis of current fluctuations in temperature make no sense. Recall that William Nordhaus uses a quadratic damage function: D(T)  =  bT  +  cT\n2, where T is temperature as before, and a particular parameterization is given in Table 7.7. But Weitzman argues that it should be exponential, so that D(T)  =  ef(T), where f(T)  =  bT  +  cT\n2, or some other function. Clearly, the exponential damage function results in much higher damages the farther into the future one projects rising temperatures.\n",

To determine the former, we assume that a tax of $25 per ton of CO2 was optimal in 2005. Using global fossil fuel emissions data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee,40 we find that 29,227 Mt of CO2 were emitted globally in 2005, with average emissions over the preceding 50 years equal to 17,835 Mt of CO2 (k is assumed to equal 50).

We then use the value of \u03b3, information on emissions of CO2 going back to 1801, and the HadCRUT3 temperature anomaly as a state variable to calculate the optimal tax rate that should have been imposed going back to 1850. The optimal tax path is given in Fig. 7.6, where negative tax rates have been assigned a value of zero.

Because energy is the most important driver of development, reducing the ability of poor people to access cheap energy serves only to keep them poor. Mitigation policies slow the economic growth of developing (and developed) countries, but will prevent the increased mortality associated with climate change. Without mitigation, on the other hand, real per capita incomes of poor people will rise to such an extent that poverty is eliminated. Based on historical evidence, this will lead to large reductions in mortality from almost all causes. As indicated in this chapter, because the Earth\u2019s poorest are projected to have high per capita incomes in the absence of action to mitigate climate change, the overall benefits of allowing climate change to occur might well exceed those of taking action and keeping countries in poverty. This provides one explanation why developing countries are not keen on taking action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions if this in any way slows economic growth.
