The scaled migration rate M between populations (i.e., twice the number of migrant genes per population per generation) is the same before and after the isolation period and mutations follow a Poisson process of rate \u03b8/2 (Kimura 1969). We used an infinite sites model for the analytical investigations, and for the simulations we considered a finite sites model with a number of sites corresponding to HIV-1 genome size (9719bp, from the reference HXB1 sequence). Our developments are based on the Wright-Fisher model (Fisher 1930; Wright 1931), where each population has a constant size N. For analytical simplicity, we considered that times Tiso and Treco are scaled in units of N generations, so Tiso=1 corresponds to an isolation event that occurred N generations ago. We derived an exact theoretical formula for the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences in nonrecombining genomic regions (Appendix A), and simulated this distribution using coalescent simulations (software ms; Hudson 2002) in the case of recombining regions. We computed the power to sample sequences from each mode of the distribution using equations A.6a\u2013A.6b (Supporting Information, Figure A in File S1).",

We studied the total SFS (considering pooled samples from all populations); in the main text, we present results for equal sample sizes in each populations, and we present results for alternative sampling schemes (Figures B and C in File S1). We also studied the joint SFS between pairs of populations. We assessed the temporal changes of the total SFS using the visual test of Nawa and Tajima (2008), which is based on the difference between the expected SFS under neutrality in a population with constant size, and the observed SFS. For each frequency i/n, where n is the sample size, the transformation represents \u03b8^i=i\u03bei, instead of the corresponding number of variants \u03bei. This simple test enables one to easily detect which frequencies present an excess or a deficit of variants. We also derived an optimal test statistic to detect the signature of population reconnection from the SFS (Text A and Figure D in File S1) and compute the power of common neutrality tests to detect such events (Figure E in File S1).",

To account for repeated bottlenecks (e.g., during transmission events), extinction-recolonization dynamics, and rapid adaptation, we simulated the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences under a scenario of reconnection of isolated populations under a beta-coalescent model. Beta-coalescent models have recently been proposed to model the genealogies of many organisms with a large variance in the number of offspring per individual (Birkner and Blath 2008; Tellier and Lemaire 2014), in particular viruses (Neher and Hallatschek 2013). We extended the algorithm from Birkner and Blath (Birkner and Blath 2008) \u2013 which generates samples under a beta-coalescent at equilibrium \u2013 to include an island model of migration (each lineage migrates to another population at rate M) and an isolation period. We assumed that coalescence processes follow the beta-coalescent at all times: before isolation, during isolation and after reconnection. In addition to mutation and migration rates, beta-coalescents rely on a parameter \u03b1 (0\u2264\u03b1\u22642) that gives the probability of multiple lineages coalescing at the same time. We present the results for four different parameter values: \u03b1=0 (equivalent to the classic Kingman coalescent), \u03b1=0.5, \u03b1=1 [corresponding to the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, used to model strong positive selection (e.g., Neher and Hallatschek 2013)], and \u03b1=1.5.",

The distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences within (within-population pairwise differences) and between clusters (between-population pairwise differences) were generated for each nonrecombinant block between subtypes that we identified with jpHMM (Schultz et al. 2009). In total, 19 and 24 blocks were identified in sequences sampled in China and South America, respectively; the 5%, median and 95% quantiles of block length were 111bp, 220bp and 1333bp, respectively. Detection of bimodality in the distribution, the signature of a past isolation event, was performed by fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm from Meng and Rubin (1993) as implemented in the R package mixtools (Benaglia et al. 2009). Gaussian distributions are used to estimate positions of the mode as distributions are symmetric (the 5% and 95% quantiles of the skewness of all components are -1.05 and 1.05, respectively). The algorithm also provides posterior probabilities of membership into modes, which is used to identify genomes that have bimodal distribution (i.e., indicating admixture). We analyzed the signatures in the pairwise nucleotide differences by comparing HIV genome signatures with the expected results, assuming either small linked sequences or large recombining sequences.",

Bimodality was observed in these distributions (both within and between populations, \u03c0w and \u03c0b) only when a population reconnection occurred (Figure 1A). This bimodality reflects the different possible origins of the two sequences sampled: the two sequences either have a recent common ancestor (i.e., after the reconnection event; first mode in Figure 1A) or an ancient common ancestor (before the isolation event; second mode in Figure 1A). Bimodality was also observed in the distributions of total pairwise nucleotide difference (considering all populations, \u03c0) after a reconnection event but, in this case, bimodality was also observed when populations were completely isolated (Treco=0, Figure 1, B and C). To differentiate a connection from an isolation event, bimodality needs to be associated with a temporal increase of the variance of the modes in the distribution (which depends on the recombination rate; see Figure 1). Although testing for increase in variance requires data from different time-points, it has the advantage of not requiring a priori knowledge of the origin of the samples (i.e., being within or between populations).",

Power to detect bimodality, with high probability (95%) (Figure A in File S1), depends on the sample size, the duration of the reconnection period, and the amount of gene flow among populations (scaled migration rate). As shown in Figure A in File S1, it is easier to detect a reconnection event from the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between populations than within populations. Indeed, the second mode in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences was larger between population (\u03c0b) than that of within population (\u03c0w, Figure 1A). This difference in mode size increases when migration is weak or intermediate (M\u22641) and the reconnection event is not recent (Figure A in File S1). Ancient reconnection events can be detected even with small sample sizes (n\u224310) when migration is moderate or strong (M\u22651; Figure A in File S1). To evaluate the temporal increases in variance of the mode, no further development is required as the Bartlett test (Bartlett 1937) can be used.",

When populations experience demographic changes, departures from this characteristic shape are expected and the size and the position of those changes are informative as to the demographic change. Consistent with the expectation, we found a large excess of variants at intermediate frequencies on the SFS following reconnection events between previously isolated populations (Figure 2). This excess was due to exchanges of variants among populations that were once fixed in one or several populations during isolation. The size and the position of this excess is indicative of the number of populations that have reconnected and of the timing of the reconnection event (Figure 2A), and can be identified by the visual test of equilibrium neutrality proposed by Nawa and Tajima (2008). We predict that in the total SFS (SFS obtained with merged samples from all populations), shortly after a reconnection event one would expect narrow, high peaks of specific variants. These peaks are found at frequencies i/d, where d is the number of sampled populations and 1\u2264i<d, when populations have equal sample sizes. In Figure 2A, peaks can be seen at frequencies 1/d and 2/d (d=3). With unbalanced sample sizes, the number of observed peaks can be higher (up to 2d\u22122 peaks; see Figure B in File S1).",

Although use of this test is restricted to recent reconnection events that follow long periods of isolation, it performs better than commonly used statistics such as Tajima\u2019s D (Tajima 1989), Fu and Li\u2019s D* and F* (Fu and Li 1993), Fay and Wu\u2019s H (Fay and Wu 2000), Zeng et al.\u2019s E (Zeng et al. 2006).

The results presented in this section apply to both recombining and nonrecombining sequences, as the expected SFS is the same in both cases (Gutenkunst et al. 2009).

Replacing the classic Kingman coalescent model (Wright-Fisher model) with a beta-coalescent model does not alter our results for values of the model parameter \u03b1 (Figure H in File S1). Beta-coalescent models account for large variance in the number of offspring per individual, as expected under repeated bottlenecks, fast extinction-recolonization dynamics, or recurrent beneficial fixations (Neher and Hallatschek 2013; Tellier and Lemaire 2014). Such variance leads to an excess of low frequency variants and smaller peaks in the total SFS compared to Kingman\u2019s coalescent model; this effect is larger for small \u03b1 values (light-gray lines Figure H in File S1). However, having an excess of variants at low frequency does not alter the identified signature of reconnection on the total SFS (dynamics of the peaks). Also the temporal dynamics of the signature distinguish this pattern from that of an IM model. Indeed under the IM model, the size of the peaks in the SFS increases with time (Figure I.B in File S1), whereas the signature of a reconnection of isolated populations is characterized by a decrease in peak size with time (Figure 2A).",

We found that a large proportion of the genome of HIV-1 displays bimodality (Figure 4). In China, this proportion was initially low but rapidly increased through time. Between 2006 and 2007, the proportion of bimodality increased fourfold (Figure 4), and increased a further 40% between 2008 and 2009. This suggests that the time series analyzed here captures a burst of HIV-1 subtype admixture. The dynamics of genomic admixture between HIV-1 subtypes in China is also highlighted by the temporal changes in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences and the SFS. The peaks formed by the excess variants (resulting from population admixture in the total SFS) decreased in size, and the values of optimal test statistics T\u03a9 significantly decreased (Figure L in File S1). We find a significant increase in the variance of the first mode in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.01 two-sided Bartlett test). The joint SFSs for the two time points also indicate that the reconnection event and genome admixture is either recent or that genome admixture is limited but ongoing. Indeed, we can observe the excess of variants along the axes of the joint SFS shifting to the diagonal (Figure 3, C and D). In South America, the proportion of bimodality in HIV-1 samples from 1999 is large (60%) and remains approximately constant from 1999 to 2004, signaling a prior reconnection event. Patterns observed in the joint SFS suggest that HIV-1 subtype genomes are well homogenized overall; further, this process of homogenization seems to have either slowed or ceased. Indeed, no increase of variance in the modes of the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences was detected (two-sided Bartlett test), and the total SFS shows only small changes between 2001 and 2005, with nonsignificant changes in values of optimal test statistics T\u03a9 (Figure L in File S1).",

Again we projected them in the PCA with original subtypes B, C, F1, and CRF01_AE as references (Figure 5). Consistent with the observations for Chinese and South American samples, we observed that HIV-1 genomes are positioned on the straight edges of the triangle formed by original subtypes, positioned at the corners, forming a continuum along the axes rather than discrete clusters within. Very few genomes are localized outside the edges of the triangle defined by the 3 original subtypes. This pattern not only signals that most of the circulating HIV-1 genomes experience constant gene flow from other subtypes but also represents the current spatial distribution of HIV-1 populations. It reflects, for example, the extensive admixture between subtypes B and CRF01_AE in Brazil and China, between B and CRF01_AE in Thailand, and B and F1 in Brazil, Argentina, and Spain.",

Our theoretical investigations identify specific genomic signatures of past population isolation. We show, for example, that the number, size, and dynamics of modes in the distributions of the pairwise nucleotide differences in populations are informative on the existence of past isolation. Our results extend previous work on the distribution of pairwise coalescence times and pairwise nucleotide differences under a model of population split with or without migration (IM model). We show, for example, that under the reconnection model, the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences has a temporal evolution which is distinct from the one expected under an IM model (Takahata 1995; Wakeley 1996; Rosenberg and Feldman 2002): the distribution is first bimodal and then tends to become unimodal with time. We also found that in the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), the presence, the position and the value variants in excess are informative as to the numbers of previously isolated populations, and the joint SFS characterizes the amount of genetic overlap between populations. Signatures identified here are robust to the presence of recombination, extinction-colonization processes, population bottlenecks, and expansion as well as skewed offspring distributions. Our developments add to the current literature in the field as we demonstrate that population reconnection after isolation is not fully captured by commonly used test statistics based on SFS classes of variants at high and/or low frequencies such as D, H, and E (Ferretti et al. 2010). Taken together, this provides critical information on the evolution of the genomic composition of populations.",

            "text": "We apply our theory in order to analyze the genome signature of successive colonization of HIV-1 subtypes in Asia and South America. In both regions, we reconstruct the successive colonization of HIV-1 subtypes, and find that they are followed by strong HIV-1 subtype admixture. We find, in these regions, that HIV diversification is followed by a temporal homogenization of HIV-1 genome composition. Our analysis highlights a large degree of admixture between circulating HIV-1 subtype genomes in China and South America, and most probably worldwide. These results suggest that genomic exchanges may indeed be relatively strong, and that HIV-1 is currently in a process of homogenization subsequent to isolation and diversification. HIV genome homogenization may seem to contradict the idea that HIV is undergoing a diversification process (Hamelaar et al. 2011; Tebit and Arts 2011; Feng et al. 2013). However, this homogenization is consistent with observed diversity in the HIV-1 population and the increased number of new HIV recombinant forms described worldwide (Hamelaar et al. 2011; Tebit and Arts 2011; Feng et al. 2013). Indeed, when isolated and diverged populations reconnect, a transient excess of genetic diversity is predicted in the resulting population (Alcala et al. 2013; Alcala and Vuilleumier 2014) as all the genetic material that accumulated during the isolation phase is shared among populations. However, this excess of genetic diversity is transient and with time, the diversity decreases (Alcala et al. 2013). In HIV-1, such processes occur through multiple recombination events among subtypes through coinfection or superinfection and are the source of novel recombinant forms. In the long term, successive recombination events will ultimately lead to the homogenization of the genomic composition of HIV-1. Homogenization might be further enhanced by selective forces imposed by the immune response or treatment acting on the HIV genome (Fellay et al. 2007; Pelak et al. 2011; Chikata et al. 2014). As many world regions are currently being newly colonized by different HIV-1 subtypes, it is expected that new recombinants may still emerge and HIV diversity will further increase. However, as demonstrated here, this is expected to be a transient state toward global homogenization.",

To confirm this, we identified the genome sequences that signal the reconnection event. As expected, they reflect first the HIV outbreak in China in 1989: colonization of B and C subtypes (variance of the first peak in the SFS is generated by B and C subtypes). The subsequent colonization of CRF01_AE at the origin of the HIV outbreak in the late 1990s is also signaled in the SFS (a high proportion of CRF01_AE in the highest mode). We obtained similar concordance for the origin of the sequences forming the peaks and the successive subtypes\u2019 colonization events in South America.",

It is also under strong selective pressure from the immune system (e.g., Snoeck et al. 2011) and undergoes frequent bottlenecks followed by population expansion [during transmission (e.g., Keele et al. 2008)]. Nevertheless, the signature observed here in the distributions of pairwise nucleotide difference and on SFS only slightly deviates from theoretical expectations. The robustness of these results may have a simple explanation: a separation of time-scales of the processes involved. Selection and population demographic changes drive divergence of populations during isolation. Migration and recombination during population reconnection allows a rapid \u2013 relative to divergence \u2013 genome admixture. Both impact genome polymorphism, but the latter does so more drastically and at much shorter time-scales.",

            "text": "The evolutionary history of an organism is a powerful resource for understanding its current evolutionary trajectory. The analytical framework developed can be applied to understanding the potential evolutionary pathway of many pathogens and other species that are characterized by periods of isolation. These events are common features of pathogens (Karlsson et al. 2014), but also occur in numerous other species, including humans and domesticated plants and animals (Ellstrand et al. 1999; Lecis et al. 2006; Caicedo et al. 2007; Green et al. 2010; Patterson et al. 2012). Reconnection following a period of isolation is increasingly recognized as an effective mechanism to trigger fast and complex adaptation (Seehausen 2002, 2004; Aguil\u00e9e et al. 2013). Following reconnection, accumulated diversity (from previously isolated populations) is shared, and the resulting high level of genetic diversity may increase the potential for adaptation (Alcala and Vuilleumier 2014). Admixture among divergent populations may also promote complex adaptation by bringing together new functions acquired in different environments that have evolved independently but are compatible with the genome. Such processes have been observed in influenza and in HIV, for example. Indeed, recombination between strains previously isolated in their nonhuman hosts preceded the HIV epidemic in humans (Bailes et al. 2003; Sharp and Hahn 2010; Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015). Such events are expected to be more frequent in the future due to the increase in human mobility (Karlsson et al. 2014). Finally, our analytical framework could also be applied to evolutionary trajectories of other zoonotic viruses, such as Ebola virus, coronaviruses, hantaviruses, or henipaviruses.",
