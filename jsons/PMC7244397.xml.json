According to the latest report of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control enterococci, VRE were the second most common bacteria causing bloodstream and urinary tract infections among hospital-acquired infections in intensive care units with a vancomycin resistance rate of 2.4% (ECDC 2016). The percentages of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) isolates in Europe ranged from 0% (Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, and Slovenia) to 46.3% (Cyprus) in 2016. VREfm isolate proportion increased markedly in Denmark (4.3\u20137.5%), Italy (4.4\u201313.4%), Bulgaria (2.3\u201318.2%) Croatia (6.8\u201322.1%), Slovakia (7.6\u201326.4%), and Romania (11.1\u201339%) between 2013 and 2016 (ECDC 2017). A rising trend can be also seen in Hungary in the same time period (7.1\u201322.4%). In accordance with the international and national trends, we recently reported the elevation of clinical VREfm from 1.7 to 11% (2012\u20132015) at our tertiary care hospital in Debrecen, Eastern Hungary (Frany\u00f3 et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Enterococci are ubiquitous in gastrointestinal tracts even though they constitute a small proportion approx. 0.01% of the normal bowel flora (Jett et al. 1994). Typical concentrations in stool are up to 108 CFU/g in humans. The oral cavity and vagina can also become colonized but enterococci are recovered from these sites in fewer than 20% of the cases (Huycke et al. 1998). Inadequate antibiotic administration is one of the main reasons for selection of resistant bacteria and long-term carriage of multiresistant pathogens increases the probability of subsequent infections. A number of risk factors have been associated with VRE colonization. These include prolonged hospital stay, advanced age, severe underlying disease, central venous catheterization, and exposure to various antibiotics such as vancomycin or metronidazole (Karki et al. 2012; Purohit et al. 2017; Sohn et al. 2013). Asymptomatic carriage of VRE and the lack of effective decolonization regimen stabilize their endemicity in the healthcare settings (Cheng et al. 2014). This colonization may serve as a reservoir for the transmission to other patients resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost (Muto et al. 2003; Stosor et al. 1998).",

Therefore, we investigated the solid screening method and also the broth enrichment for screening VRE. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the species identification of our fecal isolates. Besides phenotypic and genotypic characterization, we also investigated various risk factors which could be associated with VRE colonization.",

All categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test. If all expected value frequencies were not equal to or greater than 5, Fisher exact probability test was applied, while logistic regression was used for continuous independent variables and categorical outcome. p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Among them, 469 (48%) caused blackening of the broth and according to their macroscopic morphology, 264 isolates were selected for MALDI-TOF analysis.

Twenty-two (23.7%) VRE carriers had no medical history of microbiological culturing before stool screening and among the remaining 71, only 3 were positive for VRE from other clinical specimen.

Seventeen VRE carriers received vancomycin but did not have a history of C. difficile positivity. The association between C. difficile positivity and VRE colonization was statistically significant (p = 0.0345) likewise in other studies (\u00d6zsoy and \u0130lki 2017). The chance of VRE positivity is 2.55 times higher in CDI patients (Table 1).

Alarmingly, Alevizakos et al. (2016) stated that VRE colonized patients with malignancy were 24.15 times more likely to develop bloodstream infections. In our study, infection and diabetes were nearly as common as malignancy. In an Indian teaching hospital, researchers also found that diabetes (23.7%) was the second most common risk factor in an intensive care unit (Amberpet et al. 2016). In 21.5% of our VRE carriers, there was no any other underlying disease documented in their medical history than a diagnosis related to infectious origin (Table 1). It is obvious that infections have great impact on hospital stay and the chosen antibiotic therapy. Outpatients (7/93) were also enrolled in this study so the overall hospital stay of carriers ranged from 0 to 215 days with a mean of 25 days. Prolonged hospitalization is unambiguously an important risk factor (Purohit et al. 2017; Sohn et al. 2013; Cetinkaya et al. 2000). Longer hospitalization results in extended antibiotic consumption and only 21.5% of the carriers did not receive any antibiotics. Statistical analysis of colonized and non-colonized patients revealed an increased chance of VRE colonization in the case of diabetic patients, absence of enteric normal flora, C. difficile positivity, longer hospital stay, and advanced age.",

This is a relatively new technique that has been recently introduced in clinical microbiology. Based on the ribosomal protein profile, it can rapidly identify a wide range of bacteria to the species level (Seng et al. 2009; Gekenidis et al. 2014). In comparison with the traditional methods applied in routine diagnosis, the advantages of MALDI-TOF include minimal sample preparation, rapid and comparable results, shorter turnaround time, and lower reagent costs (Carbonnelle et al. 2011). Altogether 102 VRE were identified to the species level with this new technique and all isolates gave results with a high score value confirming that this method is superb in the identification of bacteria. Without MALDI-TOF analysis and only relying on the blackening of the screening medium or enrichment broth, we would have interpreted the samples (with esculin-hydrolyzing organisms) as false VRE positive. So additional isolates other than enterococci would have resulted in a high rate of false positivity as stated by Ieven et al. (1999); in our case, 12.8% with solid medium and 42.2% with enrichment broth.",

In our previous publication, we reported the detection of 40 vanB and 3 vanA E. faecium isolates between 2012 and 2015 from clinical samples at our hospital (Frany\u00f3 et al. 2018). In 2016, VRE isolated and characterized from clinical samples were 33 vanB and 21 vanA E. faecium. This shows that not only the prevalence of VREfm is rising compared with the previous years but also the proportion of vanA isolates as well. VRE E. faecalis rates remained low (1 vanA and 1 vanB isolate, unpublished data). The present study showed that the species and genotype distribution of fecal VRE were similar to that of the clinical isolates; 71 E. faecium (38 vanB, 33 vanA) and 5 E. faecalis (1 vanB, 4 vanA). Although the second most common species from stool was E. gallinarum (n = 23), it was prevalent only between 2004 and 2009 at our hospital in clinical samples (Dombr\u00e1di et al. 2012). Interestingly, the solid screen identified slightly more E. gallinarum than the broth but this can be due to the different time periods of screening. The proportion of E. casseliflavus was low (Table 3).",

In many hospitals, rectal swab is used for the survey of multiresistant pathogens but in the study of D\u2019Agata et al. (2001), rectal culture failed to detect a large proportion of patients with gastrointestinal colonization. Therefore, we decided to use stool samples in our study. Several articles have documented that broth enrichment enhances the detection rates (Ieven et al. 1999; Gambarotto et al. 2000; Novicki et al. 2004). The limitation of our study was the investigation of two periods with two different methods, so direct comparison of solid medium and enrichment broth could not be carried out. Although if we focus on the enrichment method, we can observe an additional 17 E. faecium VRE (Table 3).",

Stool colonization proved to be lower (2.2%) with solid screening medium but higher (5.8%) with enrichment broth compared with the prevalence of VRE infections (3.2%). Finding similar species and similar rates of vanA and vanB strains in stool VRE compared with clinical VRE might indicate the stool origin of the latter. Interestingly we found a high rate of fecal carriage of E. gallinarum which was present in clinical samples only until 2009 and was subsequently replaced by more resistant vanA/vanB strains. In view of our findings, we suggest limiting the inadequate use of antibiotics inefficient against enterococci and advise screening of risk groups such as patients with diabetes, history of recent hospitalization, or former C. difficile infection. Clinicians should also be aware if stool culturing indicates absence of coliform bacterial flora.",
