Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is also an important complication of mechanical ventilation among patients who develop respiratory failure from other causes. Approximately 15 % of intubated patients receive antibiotics for clinically diagnosed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchitis [7].

Recently, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used for pathogen identification in LRTI [27\u201329]. However, the respiratory tract microbiome has not been extensively studied in intubated subjects. Here, we performed longitudinal sampling and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract sites from critically ill subjects who were intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. Our goals were to (1) define the dynamics of the respiratory tract bacterial microbiome during mechanical ventilation, (2) identify features of bacterial community structure associated with LRTI, (3) assess the correlation between LRTI pathogens identified by clinical culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and (4) detect dominant bacterial species that may not be not recognized by culture.",

Intravenous antibacterial agent exposure was extensive and also varied among subjects (Fig. 1). Ten subjects were sampled at multiple timepoints.

The coefficient of determination (R2) and corrected coefficient of determination (\u03c92) indicated that among intubated subjects, a large proportion of the distance between samples is accounted for by subject identity\u2014i.e., that samples from the same subject are similar over time\u2014regardless of the distance metric chosen: R2 0.506 and \u03c92 0.245 for unweighted (binary) Jaccard, R2 0.845 and \u03c92 0.760 for weighted Jaccard, R2 0.520 and \u03c92 0.266 for unweighted UniFrac, and R2 0.604 and \u03c92 0.394 for weighted UniFrac distances [33]. In all cases, the proportion of distance accounted for by subject identity was highly significant (p < 0.001).

We found that intubated status was associated with a higher maximum OTU proportional abundance in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts (p = 1.3e\u22127 and p = 5.6e\u221211). Consistent with this result, GEE modeling also confirmed that within-sample (alpha) diversity, measured by the Shannon Index, was lower in intubated subjects than healthy controls (p = 4.8e\u22128 and p = 2.3e\u221213 for the URT and LRT, respectively) (Fig. 4).",

No single antibiotic class or combination of antibiotic classes achieved significance by Wald testing. Comparison of GEE models including versus excluding antibiotics by model QIC favored excluding antibiotics [34]. This evidence suggests that the relationship between longer time on a ventilator and lower diversity cannot be attributed solely to greater antibiotic exposure with longer duration of intubation.

Our results demonstrate features of lower respiratory tract bacterial community structure (i.e., diminished alpha diversity and a single, dominant taxon) that may prove useful in the diagnosis of LRTI in intubated subjects, a group in whom LRTI diagnosis is particularly challenging [36, 37]. The ability of comprehensive microbiome profiling to distinguish between a dominant taxon consistent with LRTI versus a taxon present only at low relative abundance distinguishes this approach from routine bacterial culture, which can confirm the presence or absence of a potential pathogen but provides less information about community structure.

(1) Intubated patients typically receive broad spectrum antibiotics, often before cultures are obtained. Antibiotics may turn cultures negative, but since sequence analysis does not depend on bacterial viability, this approach may still identify dominant organisms and allow better targeting of therapy. For example, the failure to detect E. faecalis by culture in subject 15 may have resulted from early administration of daptomycin, which could have been sufficient to affect culture results but not to eradicate infection. (2) Respiratory cultures typically exclude normal upper respiratory tract bacteria such as anaerobes, due to the challenges of distinguishing URT contamination from authentic LRTI. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis captures all bacteria present, and relative abundance measures have the potential to reveal outgrowth and dominance by any taxon, including those that would be responsible for anaerobic or URT-derived aspiration pneumonia. Of the subjects sampled at multiple time points, three were suspected of aspiration at the time of enrollment. Two of these subjects showed subsequent emergence of dominant taxa representing normal URT bacteria (Prevotella and Lactobacillus in subjects 1 and 6, respectively), whereas the third had a dominant organism present in lower abundance and which is less often identified in the URT (Propionibacterium acnes in subject 13).",

(1) Subjects were enrolled after intubation, so the presented data provide no insight into the effect of the intubation itself upon the lower respiratory tract microbiome. (2) While all intubated subjects were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, the comparison between intubated subjects and healthy controls may be confounded by the use of different sequencing platforms. However, a sub-analysis comparing samples sequenced on both platforms (Additional file 2: Figure S2) suggests that only a small fraction of the difference between groups is attributable to sequencing platform (Procrustes m2 = 0.13, p < 0.001). (3) Lower respiratory tract samples were obtained by deep endotracheal aspirate in intubated subjects, without concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage available for comparison. Though studies of healthy subjects have consistently shown that the bacterial community composition of the respiratory tract microbiome is similar throughout proximal and distal airway sites [30, 31], the concordance between endotracheal aspirates and direct alveolar sampling in intubated subjects remains a matter of debate, and differences may be exacerbated in the setting of LRTI, where regional heterogeneity of the respiratory tract bacterial community may be increased [45]. (4) Though we attempted to account for antibiotic exposure in our GEE model, it remains an important potential confounder or effect modifier in analysis of the relationship between respiratory tract bacterial community structure and LRTI. (5) The analysis is limited by the lack of a gold standard for LRTI diagnosis and the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of bacterial culture obtained from the lower respiratory tract [46]. (6) Although we suspect that the presence of a single, dominant OTU reflects outgrowth of a single bacterial lineage, proportional abundance may not correlate with absolute abundance; future studies will quantify absolute bacterial abundance by 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR as well. While molecular analysis offers valuable information not available through traditional respiratory tract culture, it would best serve as a complement to culture, as determination of antibiotic sensitivity currently still requires culture-based analysis, and in some cases species-level identification is not possible from 16S rRNA gene sequence alone.",

Sampling was performed by oropharyngeal (OP) swab and endotracheal (ET) aspirate. Informed consent was obtained from subjects themselves or a patient surrogate. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB (protocol #817706).
