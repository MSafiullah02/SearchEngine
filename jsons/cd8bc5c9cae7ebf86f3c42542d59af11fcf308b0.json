Health care funding that could be spent on medicine, care for the elderly or emergency room visits are instead lost to fraudulent activities by materialistic practitioners or patients. With rising healthcare costs, healthcare fraud is a major contributor to these increasing healthcare costs. This study evaluates previous anomaly detection machine learning models and proposes an unsupervised framework to identify anomalies using a Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) model. The GANs anomaly detection (GAN-AD) model was applied on two different healthcare provider data sets. The anomalous healthcare providers were further analysed through the application of classification models with the logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting models showing good performance. Results from the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) also signifies that the predictors used explain the anomalous healthcare providers.",

The study evaluated three machine learning models indicating the decision tree and logistic regression as good performing models. The lack of fraud labels contributed to the imbalance of data and a random under-sampling strategy was employed to create the different class distributions. Sparsity of medical claim data and the availability of labelled fraudulent cases highlighted in [2, 10, 16, 23, 24] is a common challenge when solving for anomaly detection problems.",

Random Forest (RF) is a tree constructed algorithm from a set of possible trees with random features at each node. Random forest can be generated efficiently and the combination of large sets of random trees generally leads to accurate models to detect anomalies [22] . Moreover, the random forest algorithm has been used in this study due to its versatility in being applied to large data sets and feature importance [6] . Decision Tree (DT) is a simple and intuitive algorithm that utilizes a top-down approach in which the root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met [6] . In the current context of anomaly classification, the decision tree model outputs a predicted target class (anomaly or normal) for each terminal node produced.

The generated data is conditioned by sampling from latent representations z discussed in Sect. 3. The data distribution for the generated data and real data is represented for one feature across the two data sets (see Fig. 2 ). The distribution of the generated data show some similarities to the real data and also points that is vastly different from the normal data points. Figure 4 shows the anomaly detection based on the anomaly score from the GANs algorithm (Eq. 2). The distributions of the anomaly score (Figs. 3 and 4) show that both components of the proposed adversarial score are suitable for the classification of normal and anomalous samples.",
