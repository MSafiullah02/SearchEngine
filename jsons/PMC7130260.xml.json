            "text": "Lectins by definition are multivalent proteins of non-immune origin that bind to sugars rather specifically, agglutinate cells, and display no catalytic activity [1] (however, see also [2], [3]). The ability of lectins to detect subtle variations in carbohydrate structures found on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids has made them a paradigm for protein\u2013carbohydrate recognition [4]. Lectins have been implicated, among other things, in defense against invading organisms, symbiotic association between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the roots of leguminous plants, recognition of host cells by viruses [5], cellular adhesion [6], cellular recognition [7] cell growth and differentiation [8], histochemical detections of sugar chains on the cell surface, staining and structural estimation of electrophoretically separated membrane glycoconjugates, and also separation of immunocyte subsets and cells in different differentiation stages. On account of their ability to specifically bind cell surface carbohydrates which play important roles in biological recognition, lectins have, during the recent past, found extensive applications for differentiating between cells, i.e. blood typing, diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, elucidation of the architecture and dynamics of cell surface carbohydrates, glycoconjugate purification and structural characterization. The reason why lectins find applications across such a broad spectrum is that they are not only ubiquitously distributed in nature, and occur in abundance in plants, especially seeds of legumes, but also because of the ease of their purification to homogeneity and the wide repertoire of carbohydrate specificities that they exhibit. It is therefore not surprising that lectins find extensive applications also in many aspects of biology and medicine, such as cell-selection processes, blood typing, analysis of oligosaccharides [9], and isolation of glycoconjugates on a preparative scale (purification of glycoproteins) by affinity chromatography.",

If carbohydrate-specific antibodies are used as affinity ligands, unphysiologically harsh conditions need to be employed to elute the proteins that get adsorbed onto the matrix during the purification of glycoconjugates; also, retention of the biological activity of the proteins purified under such circumstances is not guaranteed. Lectins, on the contrary, when immobilized and employed as the affinity ligands for the purification of the said glycoconjugates, offer an advantage since only mild conditions need be applied to elute the protein of interest. Moreover, because of their ubiquitous distribution and abundant presence, lectin purification per se is not as arduous a task as raising the carbohydrate-specific monoclonal antibodies.",

In addition to achieving the purification to apparent homogeneity of each component of a mixture of glycoproteins, SLAC also subserves the purpose of resolution of the microheterogeneity present in the carbohydrate part of the apparently homogenous glycoprotein. Primarily, by subjecting a mixture of heterogeneous glycoproteins to affinity chromatography on a matrix with a particular lectin immobilized on it, the nature of the sugar and the linkage pattern of its constituent monosaccharides is either confirmed or ruled out depending on whether the glycoprotein binds to the column or comes out in the flow through. The flow through is chromatographed on a second lectin-immobilized affinity matrix, specificity analysis is repeated, and so on. Thus, SLAC has been one of the chief means by which structural elucidation of sugars on the glycoproteins is carried out. In combination with exoglycosidase digestion and methylation analysis, one can put to use the SLAC for complete structural elucidation of the sugars. Many SLAC studies have been carried out after the first report of Cummings and Kornfeld [31], [32], and subsequently, by Endo et al. [11].",

In nature, microheterogeneity in glycoproteins is a condition that arises due to variations in their carbohydrate moiety [35].

            "text": "Since N-acetylneuraminic acid forms the terminal sugar in most glycoproteins, desialylation leads to exposure of the galactose residues. A striking role for the exposed galactose residues on the survival time and fate of these glycoproteins in vivo has been demonstrated by Ashwell and Morell [36]. Moreover, the rate and extent of the uptake of these proteins by liver parenchymal cells is determined by the number of galactose residues exposed on the surface of these glycoproteins [36]. Therefore, isolation of sialylglycoproteins at different stages of sialylation\u2013desialylation will help delineate quantitatively their uptake on the basis of the number of the galactose sites exposed. In one of the pioneering studies addressing GM resolution, the artificial generation and demonstration of the microheterogeneity subsequent to amplification by binding with monovalent galactose specific lectin ricin has been elegantly shown by Surolia et al. [35] using simple techniques of lectin affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. In this study, microheterogeneous populations of the glycoprotein fetuin were found to bind molecules of the galactose-binding lectin ricin in proportion to the degree of desialylation of the former and the number of galactose moieties exposed as a result. Monitoring the difference in molecular weight of the fetuin\u2013ricin complexes formed from radioiodinated ricin, native fetuin could be resolved into different microheterogeneous groups. This method could find application not only in purification of several other glycoproteins to homogeneity, but also in resolution of their mircoheterogeneity.",

The mass spectral techniques, especially, are an indispensable tool for the detailed analysis of the covalent structures of proteins, particularly those that are refractory to standard approaches of protein chemistry [47].

Although not much was made of the phenomenon earlier [56], GM has received due attention during the recent past. Work on various glycoproteins such as the \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, transferrin, ferritin, S-peplomer glycoprotein, etc. has shown that the expression and maintenance of GM in clinical conditions are altered. The variation in GM of the \u03b11-acid glycoprotein is implicated in a wide variety of pathological conditions such as acute inflammation [57], lung diesease [58], chronic alcohol abuse [59], alcoholic cirrhosis [60] rheumatoid arthritis [61], [62], [63], [64], depressive disorder [65], systemic lupus erythematosus [66], malignant mesothelioma [67] and renal failure [68]. The acute encephalomyelitis (and subsequent death) and demyelinating disease (in the surviving animals), which is attributed to the JHM strain of the mouse hepatitis virus (a neurotropic coronavirus), is known to be mediated by and reflected in the altered expression of the microheterogeneity of the S-peplomer glycoprotein [69]. Other glycoproteins exhibiting a disease-state-altered character of microheterogeneity are ferritin which serves as an additional tool for the diagnosis of Still's disease, an acute systemic inflammatory disorder [70] and transferrin, implicated in chronic alcohol abuse and major depression [71]; in fact, the appearance of desialo-transferrin (De-TF) in serum has been reported to be a biochemical marker of chronic alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease. The patterns of variability in transferrin structure in pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, women using oral contraceptives, nonanaemic rheumatoid arthritis, iron deficient rheumatoid arthritis and anemia of the chronic diseases have been reported too [71], [72], [73], [74].",
