A child with respiratory distress (RD) can quickly worsen to respiratory failure (RF) and finally to cardiac arrest if left untreated [1]. Hence a precise recognition and management is essential (Flowchart 14.1). As a part of the initial primary survey, look for the three \u201cE\u201d\u2013 effort, efficacy and effect of breathing [2].\nEffort of breathing \u2013 Increased effort or work of breathing if the following is present: tachypnoea, sternal/subcostal/intercostals recession, use of accessory muscles, flaring of ala nasi and stridor/wheeze/grunt. Subcostal recession is more significant than intercostal recession. Bradypnoea is a sign of exhaustion and suggests impending respiratory arrest. Increased work of breathing may be absent in central causes like CNS depression and peripheral nervous system failure as in Guillain-Barre syndrome. Check respiratory rate for 30\u201360 s (Table 14.1).\nEfficacy \u2013 Impaired efficacy of breathing is suggested by reduced chest expansion, diminished air entry and reduced SpO2 on pulse oximeter.\nEffort of breathing \u2013 Cyanosis, tachycardia and altered mental status such as confusion or agitation would suggest reduced oxygen delivery. As per Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI), fast respiratory rate (RR) was found to be the only clinical sign with high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of pneumonia. RR has to be counted meticulously for 30\u201360 s in every child seeking medical help. Bradycardia in the presence of a respiratory distress would suggest impending cardiac arrest.\n\n",
