A limited peak first occurred in mid-May 2005, the number of cases then decreasing with the onset of the southern hemisphere winter.19 From mid-July, the incidence remained stable for longer than 3 months before rising again, initially moderately, at the beginning of October and increasing exponentially in December. In addition to the increased incidence, as of January 27, 2006, 15 cases of meningoencephalitis had been reported, 12 of which were microbiologically confirmed. Six of the cases were newborns, with mother-to-child transmission strongly suspected. Six adult cases also were reported and confirmed by the national reference center in elderly patients.20\n",

Newborn mice, hamsters, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and kittens all have been infected by subcutaneous inoculation of field strains of the virus. Neutralizing or hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies to chikungunya have been recovered from sera obtained from ungulates. Verbet monkeys and baboons are infected readily, and rhesus monkeys infected by intravenous and intramuscular inoculation had viremia titers in excess of 107 mouse LD50. Subhuman primate populations are affected in epizootics that involve large numbers of the susceptible population, followed by disappearance of the virus. Hence, chikungunya virus possibly is maintained in wildlife populations by its constantly moving epizootic activity, much as respiratory and enteric virus infections are maintained in humans.31 Human acquisition occurs typically by the bite of an infected A. aegypti mosquito, although other competent mosquito vectors exist.27 Epidemics are sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission.28\n",

For children younger than 3 months, repellents are not recommended; instead, insecticide-treated bed nets should be used.22\n",

These containers include large uncovered jars for drinking water and refuse receptacles such as bottles and food tins. Hence, measures to be taken at the community level include reducing the prevalence of mosquito breeding sites by removing all open containers with stagnant water in and around buildings and/or treatment with larvicides. The quickest way to effectively reduce the mosquito population and to interrupt the transmission to use space spraying application, which knocks down the mosquitoes instantly. Aerial spraying with insecticides may be required in certain areas. The WHO recommends applying the appropriate products in intervals that are shorter than the incubation period of the pathogen in the vector and in accordance with the generation cycle of the vector.22 Measures must be taken four to five times at 5-day intervals during the \u201cattack phase.\u201d This approach ensures that the full generation cycle of the mosquitoes is broken. Thereafter a maintenance program (larvicide and periodical space spraying) should be followed to keep the mosquito population under control.32\n",
