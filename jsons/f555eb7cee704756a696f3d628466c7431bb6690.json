Risk factors and seasonal variations in the etiology of diarrhea at various destinations have also been investigated (3, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Despite the large number of Japanese tourists traveling to Thailand each year, relatively little is known about their level of risk awareness, care in food and drink selection and consumption, or how well they prepare for their journeys in terms of their health needs. Information on these factors is essential to assist health providers and organizations who are responsible for health and tourism to develop and prioritize health services for Japanese tourists. So far, only one domestic study has been conducted to assess the incidence of TD among Japanese visiting Bangkok, Thailand (10) . Therefore, in this survey, we aimed to measure the prevalence rate of, and determine the associations between general characteristics, behaviors and perceptions related to food and drink consumption and diarrheal illness of Japanese tourists, and assess their health care needs.",

Participants were recruited through a convenience sampling of Japanese tourists who visited the study areas between July 2003 and February 2004. Sample size was estimated using a single proportion formula with 95% confidence interval (CI). Sample size calculation was based on an expected TD prevalence of 36.3% among Japanese tourists (11) . Precision was set at 2.45%, and the calculated sample size was 1480. An approximate convenience sample of 300 Japanese tourists per study province was recruited using the following criteria: age \u226515 years and have stayed in Thailand for at least 3 days; only one member was recruited if the tourists traveled as one family group. Expatriate residents of Thailand or those who could not communicate verbally in Japanese or English were excluded from the study. Participants completed a questionnaire (translated into the Japanese language) while traveling independently or in a tour operation. Questionnaires were distributed to Japanese tourists at guest houses/hotels/ entertainment places and tour agencies while they went aboard their coaches. Research assistants coordinated with the staff of the guest houses, hotels and tourist guides in collecting completed questionnaires before the tourists left the study areas. Accordingly, the response rate was high, at 89.1%. Data were collected from the five study areas in July 2003, after the SARS problem had been resolved. However, the research team in the southern province only started collecting data in late October 2003, because tourism was disrupted by SARS outbreak. The highest number of tourists in Thailand is observed from October to February, peaking in December. Tourist arrivals begin to fall in March during the low-tourism season, pick up in July and August, and fall again in September (12) . Therefore, it took 3-4 months to collect data for each study area. Summer or the hot and dry season in Thailand is from March to June. The study protocol was approved by Mahidol University Ethics Committee and the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). Verbal consent was obtained from each Japanese tourist.",

This may be explained by the observation that those who frequently visit Thailand have become familiar with Thai foods and drinks, and other things, such as culture and climate. This familiarity with Thai foods makes them feel that trying local foods, or buying foods and drinks from street vendors is safe. This familiarity could reduce awareness of the potential consequences of these foods and drinks. The effects of the frequency of visiting the same country or the same place have never been investigated to date; most studies have shown the effects of the duration of stay rather than the effects of the frequency of visiting the same destination. Longer stay also increased the risk of contracting TD. The Japanese tourists who stayed longer had a greater risk of contracting TD than those who stayed for shorter periods. This result confirmed the result of the study of Cobelens et al. (15) of a cohort of 743 Dutch short-term travelers (1-6 weeks) to various subtropical areas. The study of Cavalcanti et al. (8) in Brazil showed the same result, that is, a longer stay in the destination resulted in more TD among visitors of Fortaleza City. Longer stay could increase the risk of exposure to food and drink contaminated with TD enteropathogens.",

Also, Angst and Steffen (17) reported that the repeated experiences of visiting tourists might eat and drink more carefully. The Japanese tourists who had several experiences of traveling abroad were at a higher risk than those who only traveled to Thailand directly as their first experience of traveling abroad. Therefore, these experienced Japanese tourists were quite familiar with food and drink outside their native country and might have become careless.

Approximately 31.6% always washed their hands before meals. These behaviors might have resulted in less concern about contracting TD, as hand washing was specially written in many guidebooks distributed to the tourists. \"Where to eat\" or \"food and drink\" information was also included. For the overall behavior, the Japanese tourists had only 3.3% good behaviors for food and drink consumption. Univariate analysis showed no significant association between these tourists' food and drink behaviors and the development of TD. Nevertheless, those who had need for improvement level behaviors were more likely to get TD, although the OR CI included 1. This result is similar to that of Mattila et al. (18) , who reported that among 933 adult Finnish tourists visiting Morocco, 45.0% made five or more dietary errors during the trip. They also found it difficult to comply with dietary recommendations. However, there was no significant association between the number of dietary errors and the incidence of TD. The findings of this study differed from those of the prospective study of tourists to Sri Lanka by Kozicki and Steffen (16) , which showed a strong association between dietary errors and the incidence of diarrhea. In relation to food and drink consumption perceptions related to diarrhea and diarrheal illness, in this study, 41.5% agreed that if they always drank water from a sealed container, they would not get diarrhea. The Japanese tourists might have doubted the quality of water in sealed containers. Only 42.9% of the respondents agreed that eating raw food, fresh vegetables and fruits is a potential cause of diarrhea. This may indicate lesser awareness of the risk of eating raw or fresh food, which might be contaminated by washing or handling. About 40.4% understood that severe diarrhea could cause death, although they might not have known the reaction mechanism of the human body once severe diarrhea occurs in that diarrhea results in electrolyte imbalance. Only 21.3% agreed that diarrhea can be prevented by washing hands properly. This result was consistent with the Japanese tourists' practice, as only 31.6% always washed their hands before meals. In addition, the study showed that 39.7% perceived that it is hard to find a place to wash hands before eating, which became a problem in preventing diarrhea. Univariate analysis revealed that the Japanese tourists with the need for improvement level of perception had 2.65-fold higher risk of contracting TD than those with good level of perception.",

The Japanese tourists were informed that some foods and drinks are contaminated and unhealthy in Thailand, particularly those from street vendors, which may be dangerous for their health (although actually this is not necessarily true). Therefore, the Japanese tourists may think that the most important way to prevent TD is to select a good dining place.

Several public health programs and activities have been implemented in touristattracting areas since 2000, particularly during the outbreaks of SARS in early 2003 and \"avian flu\" in 2004, mainly within the public sector boundary. The Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) serves as the prime agency in ensuring the good health of international tourists and the Thai population (25, 26) ; some examples of these programs are \"Clean Food Good Taste\", \"Clean Public Toilet\" and providing a 24-hour emergency call facility for ambulance services with emergency medical equipment. In Thailand, people use only Thai which is the official language, and English is used mostly in academic institutions. However, it is now accepted in Thailand that English is necessary for communication with people from other countries. There is also a need for health staff to be trained in English.

Furthermore, the risks of TD varied by season, but the data were collected at only one time-point. Thus, there is room for the misclassification of some cases; 2) the cross-sectional study design means that the ability to make causal inferences from the results is limited; 3) the small sample size had larger variances than the reference population. Therefore, the high prevalence of TD observed in this study must be interpreted with caution, and it is unclear whether these findings could be generalized for all Japanese tourists visiting Thailand. These findings need to be confirmed through prospective studies with more representative settings and sample sizes.",

Although the proportions of the good levels of food and drink related behaviors were low, there were indications that Japanese tourists perceived the risk of contracting TD. Organizations responsible for health and tourism should work hand-in-hand to solve these problems. Continuous spot checks of the cleanliness of various foods and drinks from street vendors, restaurants and hotels should be conducted. Health advice for travelers before they travel still remains very important, although 96-98% of travelers do not usually follow the recommended advice (9, 16) . Japanese tourists should be advised how to properly select healthy and uncontaminated food and drink, to avoid eating raw or under-cooked seafood, and to drink water preferably from sealed drinking bottles. When diarrhea does occur, they should know how to use ORS or other fluid replacements properly, and when to seek medical treatment.",
