In sewage, the time to achieve a 99.9% die-off ranged from 2 to 3 days at 23 \u00b0C (Gundy et al., 2009). Persistence of human coronaviruses on surfaces is highly variable (from 2 h to 9 days), depending on temperature, humidity, type of surface, and virus strain (Kampf et al., 2020). Moreover, several human coronaviruses have been shown to be particularly sensitive to water chlorination.",

SANITATION1 includes faecal-oral (non-bacterium) infections, characterised by agents of low infective doses, including enteroviruses (polio-, echo-, and coxsackievirus), hepatitis A and rotavirus, which can easily spread when domestic or personal hygiene is inadequate. For this route, excreta disposal has limited effect on the incidence of infections if it is disconnected from thorough changes in personal cleanliness, which requires major improvements in water supply, housing, and health education. Another worrisome route is transmission by excreta-related insect vectors (category SANITATION6). Vectors such as flies and cockroaches circulate in environments where faeces are present and may carry viruses on their body and in their intestinal tract, contaminating surfaces (Dehghani and Kassiri, 2020).",

However, the focus was mainly on the protective effect of handwashing (Cairncross, 2003; Fung and Cairncross, 2006). Recently, a fifth category of water-related diseases was proposed (Bartram and Hunter, 2015): WATER5: engineered water system-associated transmission, including inhalation of droplets or aerosols generated in plumbing systems (e.g. Legionella). This category may be of interest for a possible faecal-inhalation route of SARS-CoV-2, since researches have been raising the possibility of virus spread via wastewater plumbing systems, such as the reported spread of SARS coronavirus in sewage aerosols in a 50-storey residential building in Hong Kong (WHO, 2003) and later on controlled experiments in a full-scale plumbing test-rig (Gormley et al., 2020). However, these more recent developments in associating water to respiratory diseases have not fully captured the complex routes possibly involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person.",

This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of this hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. From faeces, there are three primary routes for the virus: to water, to surfaces or to places where insect vectors are present. From these environments, through different pathways, viruses may reach the mouth and infect both the intestinal and the respiratory tracts of a suceptible host. The four aforementioned environmental categories of water- and excreta-related diseases (WATER1, WATER2, SANITATION1 and SANITATION6) play a role in this framework. Additionally, a fifth category emerges: a \u201cwater-cleaning\u201d category, in which contaminated water used to clean surfaces may, via hand contact, bring the virus to the mouth. Validation of this framework will require significant research efforts to better understand SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity in stools, sewage, and untreated water; the role of vectors in transporting the virus, and the appropriate investigation of the \u201cwater-cleaning\u201d route.",

If the faecal\u2013oral hypothesis is confirmed, interventions related to the provision of safe water and adequate sanitation should be immediately added to the current strategies for COVID 19 pandemic control, on top of the already recognised key role of water for hand washing. Yet, considering that worldwide 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water and 4.2 billion to safely managed sanitation, the possible containment of the COVID-19 through the access to these services is per se a justification to establish immediate measures to mitigate the exposure of people living in the most vulnerable situations to faecal-oral diseases. This at the same time will respond to the call of the 2030 Agenda and reinforce the urgent need for realising the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation.",
