Moreover, H1N1 and H5N1 viruses have been shown to replicate efficiently in both human primary lung epithelial cell cultures and macrophages in vitro [23] . Using the model of fluA virusinfected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), we have found that macrophages infected with human and avian fluA viruses express differential proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [23, 24] and exhibit differential apoptosis-inducing capability in T cells through the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway [25] .",

The cytotoxicity of IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells was dependent on NKG2D activation and mediated by perforin-granzyme B and Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathways. Our findings suggest that phosphoantigen could be used to activate Vg9Vd2 T cells against fluA infections, in particular for avian fluA virus infections.",

In the present study, we focused on the cytotoxic properties of gd T cells in influenza virus infection, because cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the major mechanism to eliminate virus-infected cells and thus to eliminate potential sources of new virus. In particular, as a component of innate immunity, gd T cells may act as early responders in viral control and clearance, compared with specific CTL activity. We showed that IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells could kill \u223c50% of human H1N1 virus-infected MDMs after 6 h of coculture. Most importantly, similar potent cytotoxic activities of these cells against MDMs infected with the newly emerged avian fluA H5N1 virus and its precursor H9N2 virus were also found after 4-6 h of coculture. Furthermore, we found that IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells significantly inhibited H1N1, H9N2, and H5N1 viral replication by eliminating virus-infected MDMs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to demonstrate that IPPexpanded gd T cells have rapid and potent antiviral activity against both human and avian fluA viruses.",

During 2 weeks of stimulation by IPP and IL-2, Vg9Vd2 T cells were expanded by \u223c36-fold. In fact, phosphoantigens have demonstrated the potential to facilitate largescale in vitro expansion of functional gd T cells for use in adoptive immunotherapy for tumors [36] and infectious diseases in different models [19, 20] . Although the lack of murine counterparts of Vg9Vd2 T cells has dramatically hampered efforts to understand the in vivo roles of phosphoantigens in Vg9Vd2 T cells, the selective activation and expansion of these cells by phosphoantigens were also confirmed in some in vivo models, such as cynomolgus monkeys and severe combined immunodeficient mice engrafted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (human PBL-SCID mice) [17, 37] . Therefore, phosphoantigens such as IPP could be an alternative for treating human and avian fluA infections via targeting Vg9Vd2 T cells. Indeed, synthetic phosphoantigens named therapeutic amino-bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronate) have been commonly used clinically to treat osteoporosis through Vg9Vd2 T cell-mediated lysis of osteoclasts [38, 39] .",

Because gd T cells express chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 and are capable of diapedesis [40] , these cells should be able to migrate to inflammatory sites. A more recent study in a macaque model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection demonstrated that phosphoantigen-specific gd T cells could accumulate at all inflammatory sites in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues (including the lungs) [41] , suggesting that the strategy of targeting gd T cells by phosphoantigens may be feasible for the treatment of human and avian fluA virus infections. Use of nonhuman primate models or human PBL-SCID mice to further evaluate gd T cell-based immunotherapy for influenza virus infections in vivo may accelerate its future clinical application.",

It has recently been demonstrated that NKG2D can directly activate Vg9Vd2 T cells and trigger their release of cytolytic granules through recognition of the NKG2D ligand [44] . In humans, it has been identified that stress-inducible major histocompatibility complex class I-related proteins A and B and members of the UL16-binding protein family (ULBP1-4 and RAET1G) are the ligands for NKG2D [45] . In different tumor models, NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity was reported to be involved in the lysis of tumor cells by gd T cells [18, 46] . In the present study, we showed that most IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells expressed NKG2D and that the cytotoxicity of Vg9Vd2 T cells against H1N1-and H9N2-infected MDMs was significantly blocked by NKG2D neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the killing of influenza virus-infected cells by Vg9Vd2 T cells requires NKG2D activation and recognition. That only influenza virus-infected MDMs expressed up-regulated major histocompatibility complex class I-related protein B, an NKG2D ligand [47] , could also explain why IPPexpanded Vg9Vd2 T cells killed only H1N1-, H9N2-, and H5N1-infected MDMs but not mock-infected MDMs in the present study.",

P ! .05 lated PBMCs contained 1%-5% of Vg9Vd2 T cells from 12 randomly selected healthy adult donors; after 14 days of in vitro culture in the presence of IPP and IL-2, the Vg9Vd2 T cells were expanded by 36-fold (range, 19-55-fold), and the percentage of Vg9Vd2 T cells within PBMCs increased to 60%-80%. IL-2 alone did not increase the absolute number of Vg9Vd2 T cells. The purity of Vg9Vd2 T cells after magnetic sorting was consistently 197%.To determine the phenotypes of the Vg9Vd2 T cells, we examined cell surface markers (NKG2D, Fas, FasL, and TRAIL) and intracellular cytolytic granules (perforin and granzyme B) in both fresh and IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells. As shown infigure 1, fresh Vg9Vd2 T cells expressed medium levels of NKG2D, Fas, TRAIL, perforin, and granzyme B, whereas the expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells had much higher levels of NKG2D and perforin and similar levels of Fas, TRAIL, and granzyme B compared with fresh Vg9Vd2 T cells. In contrast, both fresh and expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells expressed little or no FasL(figure 1).Efficient killing of human and avian fluA virus-infected MDMs by Vg9Vd2 T cells.To determine whether Vg9Vd2 T cells could kill fluA virus-infected MDMs, we examined their cytolytic activities during the coculture of IPP-expanded Vg9Vd2 T cells with virus-infected autologous MDMs. Vg9Vd2 T cells did not show any cytolytic activity against mock-infected MDMs, but they displayed potent cytotoxicity against both human fluA virus-infected and avian fluA virus-infected MDMs in a dose-dependent manner (figure 2).

Importantly, similar results were also found in avian fluA H9N2-infected and avian fluA H5N1-infected MDMs (figure 2B and 2C). There were no significant differences in the cytotoxicity of Vg9Vd2 T cells between these 3 fluA viruses (figure 2).",

P ! .01 duced in the coculture of virus-infected MDMs with Vg9Vd2 T cells, compared with virus-infected MDMs alone (figure 3).",
