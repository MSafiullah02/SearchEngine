Recently, however, we have described an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects rhinovirus-specific antibodies in sera and nasal secretions [Barclay and .A-Nakib, 19871. Here we describe an evaluation of the ELISA in a study involving 71 adult volunteers inoculated intranasally with human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV-2). Preand post-inoculation serum samples and pre-inoculation nasal washings were tested for the presence of HRV-2-specific antibodies by ELISA. Such antibodies were associated with protection against infection when present locally in nasal secretions, but when also present in the serum they were associated with protection against both infection and the development of illness. The antibody concentrations showed strong correlation with each other and with that of antibodies detected by the neutralisation test. Following HRV-2 infection, rises in HRV-2-specific IgA in sera detected by ELISA occurred more frequently than rises in neutralising antibody. These results suggest that the ELISA is a sensitive and reliable indicator of recent infection, as well as a predictor of homologous immune status.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Rhinoviruses are the major causative agents of the common cold [Couch, 19841.

These antibodies have traditionally been detected by neutralisation tests [Hamparian, 19791 . Recently, however, we have established a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects rhinovirus-specific antibodies in sera and unconcentrated nasal washings. This new assay is simple, rapid, and can differentiate between classes of rhinovirus-specific immunoglobulins. In a preliminary study involving 12 volunteers inoculated intranasally with human rhinovirus EL (HRV-EL), we showed that the presence of circulating rhinovirus-specific IgA, rather than IgG, protected volunteers from infection [Barclay and Al-Nakib, 19871. In the present study we describe a more extensive analysis of the anti-human rhinovirus type 2 (anti-HRV-2) immunoglobulin responses in both sera and nasal washings measured by ELISA. Thus 7 1 volunteers were inoculated intranasally with HRV-2, and the course of infection was monitored both clinically and virologically .

Interestingly, the presence of HRV-2specific IgA in nasal secretions was only associated with protection against infection but not illness. Our findings are in general agreement with those for another virus that causes common colds-coronavirus 229E [Callow, 19851.

The latter have been shown to cross-react with antisera against heterologous serotypes [Lonberg-Holm and Yin, 19731 . Thus, IgG persisting from previous infections with other rhinovirus serotypes could cross-react in the ELISA. We have recently obtained evidence that purification of the homotypic full virus particles on sucrose density gradients for use as antigens in the assay improves the specificity of the test (Barclay, unpublished data) .
