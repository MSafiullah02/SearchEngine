            "text": "Acute viral bronchiolitis, mainly caused by respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus1, 2 is one of the most common respiratory diseases in early childhood and a major health problem worldwide.3 Severe bronchiolitis is characterized by extensive inflammation and edema of the airway, increased mucus production, and necrosis of airway epithelial cells.4 Admission to hospital with bronchiolitis at a young age is associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing.5 It is important to know whether it is the initial epithelial injury that is responsible for severity and sequelae, or whether the inflammatory response to the viral agent predisposes the patient to relapses. Much effort has been made to identify novel biological markers measurable during the course of acute bronchiolitis for clinically effective prediction of disease severity and later wheezing.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Our team has studied epithelial injury biomarkers in acute bronchiolitis, but found no correlation between serum levels of KL\u201062, or serum\u2010soluble receptor for advanced glycation end\u2010product,11 and severity of acute bronchiolitis and risk of wheezing bronchitis.",

In vitro, CC16 has an anti\u2010inflammatory activity, inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity, arachidonic acid production, and prostaglandin and leukotriene release, thereby countering several chronic pulmonary diseases.

Also, CC16u was correlated with severity score, duration of stay and type of stay, with higher values for the most severe cases. Increased CC16 levels during acute bronchiolitis could be the result of viral damage on the epithelial barrier, which is well described in fulminant forms.21 A disruption of the epithelial barrier in the deep lung could lead to enhanced leakage of CC16 in the serum, and secondarily in urine. In our study, serum and urinary levels were correlated, suggesting that the discordant results could be explained in part by the limited number of blood samples compared to urine samples (91 vs 151 respectively). Furthermore, our cases were mainly affected by mild to moderate forms.",

The main variation factor for CC16u is likely to be tubular function.22 To take account of this, we integrated the assay of RBP, a marker of tubular reabsorption function. Our multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation with RBP urinary levels. This argues for a systematic adjustment of CC16u by RBPu or another renal function marker such as urinary creatinine. LogCC16u/logRBPu was correlated to acute bronchiolitis severity, evaluated by the Wainwright score. Likewise, hydration status at the time of sampling should also be taken into account. The most severe cases were the youngest infants, who are most vulnerable to feeding difficulties, marked respiratory effort and subsequent dehydration. Other factors of variation need to be integrated in multivariable models for a precise interpretation of CC16 levels. Environmental factors,13, 23, 24, 25 physiological data such as age26 and sex, time of sampling14, 27 and physical activity28 have been more fully described.",
