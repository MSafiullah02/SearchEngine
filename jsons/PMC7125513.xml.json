CR1 has drawn huge attention of the scientists because of its gene polymorphisms, structural variances, diversity of functions and disease associations. Potential of CR1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker is being increasingly realized. Extensive research on CR1 has brought insight to the pathophysiology of a galaxy of diseases including the autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.",

The first 28 are organized into four long homologous repeats (LHRs) each with seven consecutive SCRs (Wong et al., 1989). The functional domains of the CR1 protein are also specifically distributed among the different LHRs. LHR-A principally binds with C4b. LHR-B and LHR-C both bind with C3b/C4b (Klickstein et al., 1988) and PfEMP1 (Rowe et al., 2000) and have the cofactor activity (Ross et al., 1982) for factor I The LHR-D has binding sites for Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) (Ghiran et al., 2000) and C1q (Klickstein et al., 1997). The SCR 25 in LHR-D has the binding sites of Swain\u2013Langley (Sl) and McCoy (McC) Knops blood group antigens (Moulds et al., 2001). The structure of sCR1 is similar to that of surface CR1 except that it lacks a cytoplasmic tail and is generated by proteolytic cleavage in the C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain of the surface CR1 molecule (Hamer et al., 1998).",

Soluble CR1 had been isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage of the patients with inflammatory lung disorders (Hamacher et al., 1998) and from the plasma of the patients suffering from hepatic and renal failure and lymphomas and leukemias (Pascual et al., 1993). Increased levels of sCR1 in plasma had also been reported in SLE and glomerulonephritis (Das et al., 2002).

            "text": "Various polymorphisms have been studied for their ability to alter the density of erythrocyte CR1 on the cell membranes. There might be a 10-fold difference between the ECR1 in different individuals owing to their specific genotypic composition (Wilson et al., 1982). The levels of CR1 on the leucocytes do not show variability like ECR1 (Wilson et al., 1986). The HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism (HindIII RFLP) corresponds to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the intron 27(with a single base substitution, T520C) of the CR1 gene (Wilson et al., 1987). The HindIII 7.4 kb genomic fragment, associated with high expression allele (H allele), and the 6.9 kb HindIII genomic fragment, associated with low expression allele (L allele). Presence of several exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Xiang et al., 1999, Table 1\n), in linkage disequilibrium with the HindIII RFLP polymorphism is suggested as a probable mechanism for alteration of ECR1 by the intronic HindIII RFLP. The H allele is now considered to contain G3093, A3650, and C5507 (encoding Gln981, His1167, and Pro1786); and the L allele is considered to contain T3093, G3650, and G5507 (encoding His981, Arg1167, and Arg1786). These variances in the amino acid composition are suggested to influence the stability of CR1 protein. The ECR1 levels show a trimodal distribution, high expression phenotype (\u223c 1000 molecules per cell) in association with the homozygous H, intermediate expression with heterozygous HL and low expression (\u223c100 molecules per cell) with homozygous L genotype in Caucasians (Xiang et al., 1999) and Indians (Katyal et al., 2003) but not in Africans (Rowe et al., 2002).",

These are not post-translational modifications as their unglycosylated primary transcript possesses the same variation (Lublin et al., 1986). The genomic difference between each allotype ranges from 1.3 to 1.5 kb, equivalent to a single LHR (Wong et al., 1986, Holers et al., 1987). The insertion-deletion mechanisms due to unequal crossing over of chromosomes have been considered responsible for such a variation (Holers et al., 1987). The CR1-C (160 kDa), CR1-A (190 kDa), CR1-B (220 kDa) and CR1-D (250 kDa) are the four variants as analyzed on SDS\u2013PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Van Dyne et al., 1987). The LHR repeats give an additional C3b binding site to the larger variants (CR1-B and CR1-D) while the small CR1-C has only one such site, the functional implication, however, is not clear. The most frequent alleles are the CR1-A (F allotype) and the CR1-B (S allotype) followed by the CR1-C. CR1-D allele is very rare (Dykman et al., 1985, Moulds et al., 1996). The gene frequencies of CR1-A and CR1-B are 0.87 and 0.11 in Caucasians, 0.82 and 0.11 in African Americans, 0.89 and 0.11 in Mexicans (Moulds et al., 1996) and 0.916 and 0.084 in Asian Indians (Katyal et al., 2003).

These antigens were identified by the occurrence of high avidity non-complement fixing and non-hemolysing antibodies in the circulation. Subsequently, it was identified that the corresponding antigens were present on the CR1 molecule (Moulds et al., 1991, Rao et al., 1991) and the genes coding them were located in the LHR-D region of the CR1 gene (Moulds et al., 2001, Tamasauskas et al., 2001). Recently Sla has been sub-classified into various conformational variants (Moulds, 2002). The various Knops blood group genotypes are generated by Single Nucleotide polymorphism in exon 29 (SCR\u201325) (Moulds et al., 2004). The identification of Knops blood group antigens as CR1 phenotypes was indicated by the discovery that the serologically null phenotype, the \u2018Helgeson phenotype\u2019 of the Knops blood group showed reduced CR1 levels (Moulds et al., 1992).

Some indirect findings suggest that a decrease in ECR1 levels is seen in various inflammatory and malignant disorders, which also have higher levels of serum proteases like elastase (Currie et al., 1990). Cells like the mesangial cells and possibly some circulatory cells may be responsible for pericellular proteolysis in cells which have Terminal complex of complement (C5b-9) deposited onto the cell membranes (Adler et al., 1987, Lovett et al., 1987).

With the presumption that the mechanism of CR1 expression and its modulation on the nuclear cells might be different from that envisaged for the erythrocytes, Arora et al. conducted a series of experiments on leucocytes and neutrophils from the healthy individuals and patients with SLE. It was evidenced that reduced gene transcription, enhanced proteolytic cleavage and defective targeting of vesicular CR1 to the cell membrane, collectively contribute to the marked decline of leukocyte CR1 in SLE (Arora et al., 2004, Arora et al., 2007) (Fig. 3\n).",

This mechanism to a great extent, explains the role of CR1 in the malarial complications arising out of microvascular obstructive pathology, mainly the cerebral malaria. The other aspect of CR1 involvement includes the clearance of immune complexes (Cosio et al., 1990), which is a role that has been well studied in various autoimmune disorders.",

HH genotype, by increasing the ECR1 numbers, increases the CR1 mediated rosetting and associated sequelae. The LL genotype although associated with reduced rosetting, adversely affects the capacity of the erythrocytes to clear the immune complexes, associated with malarial infection, owing to the reduced ECR1 levels. Both the arguments have been supported by severity correlation in different groups of populations. The Caucasian study group of Cockburn et al. (2004) shows severity correlation to the HH genotype while, a study on the Thai population (Nagayasu et al., 2001) has shown that low rosetting, high immune complex state of LL genotype is correlated with malarial severity. As expected, a metabolic pattern of severity dominates in the Southeast Asian countries (Nagayasu et al., 2001). The African population has not shown correlation of CR1 density or malarial severity with any Hind III RFLP genotype (Rowe et al., 2002).",

Preliminary (unpublished work) work of Madhukar et al. and Das et al. (Madhukar et al., Das et al., Presented at the Keystone Symposium, Albach, Austria, 2008)) have shown that malaria severity correlates with Q981H and HindIII RFLP. The Knops blood group antigens, specifically the McCoy and Swain\u2013Langley group have a role to play in the malarial pathogenesis. The Sl (a\u2212) antigenic variants have been shown to rosette less efficiently than the Sl (a + ) (Rowe et al., 2000). It has been shown that chances of Cerebral Malaria are reduced in the Sl (a\u2212)/McC (a/b) genotypes as compared to the Sl (a+)/McC (a/a) and hence there is possibility that SI (a\u2212) and McC (b + ) provide a selective advantage for their selection in malarial endemic regions of Africa, as shown for Mali in Table 2\n(Moulds et al., 2000). Another study in Gambia has failed to find an association between malarial severity and Knops blood group antigens (Zimmerman et al., 2003).",

A decline in adherence of M. tuberculosis by 40 \u00b1 5% (Schlesinger et al., 1990) was observed. Preliminary investigations have indicated upregulation of CR1 by M. tuberculosis soluble antigen ESAT 6 (Preliminary findings accepted for presentation at XXII ICW, 2008, data not shown here). In patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder, the levels of ECR1 were found inversely proportional to the degree of cancer invasion and distant metastasis and hence to disease severity. Here too the decline in the levels of ECR1 was found to be an acquired phenomenon (Jiao et al., 2004). In Leishmanial infections the CR1 receptor has been shown to be involved in the binding of Leishamania major metacyclic promastigotes to human macrophages (Da Silva et al., 1989, Rosenthal et al., 1996). The levels of E-CR1 decline during phases of initiation and progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Wang et al., 2005). The expression of CR1 on the neutrophils of patients with severe atopic dermatitis was higher than those with the mild form of the disease (Yoshida et al., 2002).",

The soluble form of CR1 though functionally active is normally present in very low concentrations in the plasma. A recombinant form of sCR1 has been designed to assess the therapeutic potential of CR1. This recombinant CR1, the rCR1 has the C3b and C4b binding sites and the activity as a cofactor for Factor I. Its therapeutic efficacy had been assessed for various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (Weisman et al., 1990a). The animal model experiments have validated the resolution of inflammatory changes accompanying inflammatory lung injury (Rabinovici et al., 1992), Myocardial infarction (Weisman et al., 1990b), autoimmune thyroiditis (Metcalfe et al., 1996) and glomerulonephritis (Couser et al., 1995) with the use of recombinant soluble CR1. Use of sCR1 for managing incompatible blood transfusion by inhibition of complement activation and subsequent immune hemolysis had been suggested (Yazdanbakhsh and Scaradavou, 2004). Since sCR1 can potentially prevent E-resetting and clear immune complexes in patients, it is envisaged as a therapeutic for severe falciparum malaria (Cockburn et al., 2004). Soluble CR1 has long been expected to ameliorate the suffering from various disease conditions, but most of the studies which promise such a revolution in health care strategies, have been based on animal models of these diseases (Weisman et al., 1990b, Rabinovici et al., 1992, Couser et al., 1995), which may have limited value in light of important species differences in the mechanisms of immune complex clearance.",

There is ample evidence to suggest multifaceted association of Complement Receptor 1 with a vast array of diseases. CR1 is a functionally versatile protein with structural variance. Complement Receptor 1 genetics and its relationship with disease processes open up a fascinating area of research. CR1 is an extremely important molecule in disease processes where immune complex deposition and excessive complement system activation result in tissue damage. Its biological role allows it to be a future candidate as a marker for determining disease susceptibility, diagnosis and prognosis. Various trials on animal models with CR1 as a therapeutic had established this molecule as a chain breaker of complement-mediated inflammatory reactions and subsequent organ damage. The various aspects of CR1 as assembled in this review may intensify further investigations on CR1 in achieving better insight into a large number of diseases and to open up novel therapeutic strategies.",
