            "text": "Like the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1, the avian influenza A virus subtype H7N9 also continues to be a serious threat to public health (Gao et al., 2013). As of May 1, 2017, a total of 1,421 laboratory-confirmed human H7N9 infection cases have been reported (http://www.who.int/csr/don/01-may-2017-ah7n9-china/en/). Most of the cases have been in Mainland China, but the virus has also spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Malaysia, and Canada (Lin et al., 2016). Most seriously, the ongoing fifth epidemic wave represents the largest H7N9 outbreak since its first appearance in 2013, with 693 laboratory-confirmed human infections and much more widespread geographical distributions since October 2016. Currently, however, no approved H7N9-specific vaccine is available to prevent this viral infection, even though some vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials (Tang et al., 2014). In addition, although H7N9 is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) (Tang et al., 2014, Yen et al., 2013), data from laboratory-scale studies showed that treatment options and possible production of resistant strains may render these influenza antiviral drugs ineffective (Tang et al., 2014, Yen et al., 2013, Kiso et al., 2004). Such findings call for the development of new and effective therapeutic approaches to combat human H7N9 infections.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are being explored as therapeutics against viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Zhou et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2014), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Nipah and Hendra viruses (Zhu et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2013, Geisbert et al., 2014). For influenza virus, hemagglutinin (HA), a trimeric surface glycoprotein, is the primary target for vaccine and antiviral development. HA facilitates virus entry by binding the sialic acid receptors using its globular head region of HA1 subunit, and then undergoes the acid pH-induced conformational change resulting in fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. Notably, the majority of influenza antibodies elicited by immunization or infection are directed against five antigenic sites on HA1 globular head, designated Ca1, Ca2, Cb, Sa, and Sb (Gerhard et al., 1981, Caton et al., 1982, Zuo et al., 2015). Recently, a number of neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs targeting stem region of HA2 were identified that could mediate antiviral effects through Fc-Fc\u03b3 receptor interactions and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Kallewaard et al., 2016, DiLillo et al., 2014, Dunand et al., 2016, Tan et al., 2016). However, it remains controversial whether the ADCC effects participate in the functions of HA1-targeting antibodies (Jegaskanda et al., 2014, DiLillo et al., 2014, DiLillo et al., 2016). Furthermore, an HA1 epitope capable of eliciting protective ADCC-antibodies has not yet been identified (Ye et al., 2017).",

The recombinant H7N9 HA1 and HA proteins were selected as antigens for sequential panning of a very large naive antibody library constructed from the blood of healthy adult donors. Interestingly, one of the selected antibodies, designated as m826, did not neutralize the virus in tissue cultures, but rather, it induced very strong ADCC activity and was highly effective against H7N9 virus infection in a mouse model. It bound to HA with pH-dependent high affinity to a unique epitope distinct from the conventional HA1 antigenic sites as identified by the high-resolution (1.9 \u00c5) crystal structure of its complex with H7N9 HA1. Another unique feature of m826 is its germline sequence which suggests that vaccines based on its epitope could be highly effective, and that its further development as candidate antiviral agents could be easier compared with highly somatically mutated antibodies.",

In this study, we designed a sequential panning strategy to isolate H7N9 HA1-specific antibodies.

Significant enrichment against HA-SH1, HA-SH2, and HA1-SH2 was observed after the fourth round of panning (Figure 1B). A panel of antibodies was selected, and one antibody, designated as m826, bound potently to H7 HA proteins (H7N7 and H7N9). m826 was also reactive to H15N8 HA, although to a lesser extent, but not to HA from other subtypes including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H10N8 (Figure 1C).",

The m826 VL gene was also very close to IGKV1-39\u221701 germline (99.6% identity), except for a point mutation, leading to a change from Met to Leu at position 4, which is located in the N terminus of light chain (Figure 1D). The reversion of this mutation (L4M mutant) did not have any effect on the antigen binding of m826 (Figure S1). In fact, while IGKV1-39 and some IGKV alleles have a methionine at position 4, all other alleles (IGKV1-9, IGKV1-13, IGKV1D-13, IGKV1-37, IGKV3-11, IGKV3D-11, IGKV3-20, IGKV3D-20, IGKV5-2, IGKV6-21, IGKV7-3, etc.) have a leucine at this position, suggesting that the point mutation of m826 light chain at position 4 was due to allelic polymorphism rather than somatic mutation.",

To further investigate the immunogenetic characteristics of m826-like antibodies, we analyzed in detail the IGHV1-69 recombination frequency with specific IGHD and IGHJ genes using next-generation sequencing data of our antibodyome studies from naive immunoglobulin M (IgM) repertoires of 33 healthy adult donors and neonatal IgM repertoires of 10 newborn babies. Our analysis revealed that IGHV1-69 is one of the most frequently used IGHV genes (Figures S2A and S2B). Among a total of 10,498,301 sequences from healthy adult IgM repertoires, 1,063 sequences were found to display m826-like V(D)J recombination (IGHV1-69, IGHD3, and IGHJ1), indicating a relatively high frequency of this specific V(D)J recombination pattern (Figure S2A). The similar recombination frequency was also observed in IgM repertoires of newborn babies, in which 1,527 sequences with m826-like V(D)J recombination were identified from 5,617,227 sequences (Figure S2B). By aligning the m826 sequence with the sequences from IgM repertoires, we successfully identified a number of clones that share high sequence similarity to m826 (Figures 1E and S2C). Remarkably, a sequence that shared 100% identity (including VDJ and junctional residues) with m826 heavy chain was found from IgM repertoires of newborn babies (Figures 1E and S2C). Furthermore, we have previously sequenced the antibody repertoires of 15 H7N9-infected patients (Hou et al., 2016). Although it is not possible to accurately map the frequency of V(D)J recombination due to the limited numbers of B cells obtained from these patients, we still identified a number of sequences sharing a significant degree of similarity with that of m826 (Figures 1E and S2D).",

Interestingly, the binding of m826 with HA1 was not affected by the change of pH, and the binding affinity (0.3 nM) was similar to that of trimeric HA at acidic pH (0.8 nM) (Figure 2C).

Both the heavy-chain variable domain (VH) and the light-chain variable domain (VL) of m826 are involved in the interactions, gripping the antigen with all six CDRs (Figure 3B). At high resolution, the exact contacts at the interface were determined without ambiguity (Figures 3C and 3D). The principal interactions between VH and HA1 are hydrophobic, with HCDR2 and HCDR3 making extensive contact with the hydrophobic pocket formed by HA1 residues Leu108, Ile111, Trp234, Met236, and Leu260 (Figure 3E; Table S1). Unlike VH, VL interacts with HA1 primarily through electrostatic interactions.

Evidently, the m826 epitope is distinct from the RBS (Figure 4\nA). In the previously reported H7N9 HA study, HA was purified as a monomer and formed a trimer in the crystallization structure (Yang et al., 2013). Superposition of the HA1 in its m826-bound form with that in trimeric form resulted in C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation of 0.36 \u00c5, indicating that binding of m826 did not induce significant conformational changes. It is interesting to note that the antibody epitope was buried in the trimeric structure (Figure 4B). At acidic pH, HA undergoes conformational changes that lead to the dissociation of the top domains of the trimeric spike and the improved accessibility of m826 epitope, explaining the 10-fold difference in binding affinity of m826 to trimeric HA between neutral and acidic pH.",

These immunodominant antigenic regions correspond to four topographically distinct HA1 regions. We found that the epitope of m826 is distinct from these conventional antibody epitopes (Figure 4C). This epitope is also highly conserved among different H7N9 isolates, as well as influenza A virus subtypes H7N7 and H7N4, indicating that m826 recognizes a unique epitope on H7 HA1.",

We next measured the neutralizing activity of m826 against live H7N3 and H7N9 viruses. Interestingly, while polyclonal sera from immunized rabbits or sheep potently neutralized the viruses, the antibody m826 did not show any neutralization against live H7N3 and H7N9 viruses (Figure S4). To confirm this finding, we further assessed the neutralization of m826 against H7N4 (A/Korea/W266/2007) virus using an imaging-based immunofluorescent assay (Chai et al., 2017). The viral replication was quantified by measuring the level of influenza nucleocapsid protein expression. As shown in Figure 5\nA, the positive anti-H7N7 control antibody inhibited viral replication approximately 45% at 16 hr post-infection, while m826 did not neutralize H7N4 virus at the same concentration (2 mg/mL). Taken together, these results indicate that m826 cannot effectively neutralize H7 viruses. We also monitored whether m826 interferes with either viral attachment (EB) to cell surface receptor of target cells or membrane fusion (EF). R18/SP-DiOC18(3)-labeled H7N4 virus was incubated with m826 and applied to A549 cells for 30 and 180 min to examine viral attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. At 30 min post-infection (mpi), we monitored labeled viruses (red dots) in the cells. The viruses incubated with m336 or m826 still entered the cells, while the labeled viruses in a neuraminidase-treated control was significantly decreased (Figure S5A). Moreover, in the entry-fusion assay at 180 mpi, DiOC18 signals were detected not in the positive control bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) but in the antibody-treated group. Similar to control MERS-CoV antibody m336, neither cell binding nor membrane fusion of the H7N4 virus was affected by IgG m826 (Figure S5B).",

The ADCC activity was measured in two assays: a dual-luciferase reporter gene-based ADCC assay, and the conventional peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based cytotoxicity assay. CR9114, a potent human mAb targeting a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem (Dreyfus et al., 2012), was used as the positive control. As shown in Figure 5C, m826 elicited robust ADCC against H7N9 HA-expressing cells, whereas the negative control antibody (unrelated anti-MERS-CoV antibody m336) elicited low to undetectable ADCC. It is remarkable that m826 was capable of eliciting evidently higher ADCC activity than CR9114 which has been demonstrated to be a potent mediator of ADCC (Dreyfus et al., 2012, Cox et al., 2016). Similarly, m826 was found to mediate more potent ADCC effect than CR9114 in a concentration-dependent manner using human PBMCs as effector cells (Figure 5D).",

Clinical manifestations (weight loss) and mortality in the mice were monitored for 14 days. As shown in Figure 6\nA, mice in the control group (PBS) all died 6 days after viral challenge. In contrast, IgG1 m826 at 1 mg conferred full protection (100%) from lethality by H7N9 in the infected mice, while m826 at 0.5 mg per mice was only partially (80%) protective for the mice. Similarly, mice in the control group gradually lost weight after H7N9 infection and eventually died (Figure 6B). Although mice receiving m826 at 1 mg also showed a gradual weight loss after infection, body weight started to recover 4 days post-infection and even increased by the study's end (Figure 6B). Mice receiving m826 at 0.5 mg group lost approximately 20%\u201330% of body weight until day 9 before starting to recover.

Therapeutic antibodies have been broadly developed to prevent viral infections, such as licensed antibodies (Keller and Stiehm, 2000) for hepatitis B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rabies virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus, and developing antibodies for HIV-1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Nipah and Hendra viruses (Zhou et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2014, Geisbert et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2007, Ying et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2015b). Notably, except for isolating mAbs from infected or vaccinated subjects, the large naive antibody library-based technologies have enabled the rapid development of high-affinity hmAbs, highlighting the potential use of antibody-based antivirals against emerging viruses and diseases that occur in an outbreak setting. For instance, by using large naive antibody library, we successfully identified three hmAbs against MERS-CoV, including m336, m337, and m338 (Ying et al., 2014a, Ying et al., 2015). Among them, m336 exhibited the ultra-potent neutralizing activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.005 \u03bcg/mL) in vitro, and it was also highly effective in three different animal models: rabbit (Houser et al., 2016), mouse (Agrawal et al., 2016), and marmoset (van Doremalen et al., 2017).",

Currently, several hmAbs have therapeutic potential to treat H7N9 infection (Henry Dunand et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2015, Tharakaraman et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015a, Dunand et al., 2016, Thornburg et al., 2016). All these mAbs exhibited comparable activity in mouse models of H7N9 infection. However, their potential for development depends on their respective properties and other factors. This is difficult to predict and requires detailed characterization of a number of properties, including, for example, propensity for aggregation or levels of expression. In general, germline antibodies have better drugability and safety compared with the antibodies with high somatic mutations (Dimitrov, 2010). As one example, our antibody m102.4 against Hendra and Nipah viruses is near germline and exhibited very good drugability, including the successful completion of a phase I clinical trial with 40 healthy volunteers (Zhu et al., 2006, Zhu et al., 2008, Bossart et al., 2011, Geisbert et al., 2014). We therefore expect that IgG1 m826 has similarly good drugability as m102.4 and could be further developed as a useful candidate therapeutic.",

            "text": "The germline nature of this antibody also implies that m826, or similar antibodies, can be elicited relatively fast because of the low number of somatic mutations required for affinity maturation. This is in contrast to the antibodies against HIV-1 and likely other chronic infections that could be highly divergent from their putative germline predecessors, and may require extensive and complex affinity maturation pathways to obtain breadth and potency (Zhou et al., 2013, Hoot et al., 2013, Jardine et al., 2013). Indeed, it was recently found that neutralizing mAbs isolated from H7N9 vaccine recipients possessed low numbers of somatic mutations, suggesting the clones arose from naive B cells (Thornburg et al., 2016). Structural analysis suggests that junctional residues play an important role in the binding, which is in agreement with our previous finding that germline-like antibodies achieve high-affinity binding to antigens through V-D and D-J junctional segments and allelic-specific residues (Ying et al., 2015). Because we solved the crystal structure of m826 in complex with the antigen, the structure of the epitope is now known and could be used as a template for a vaccine immunogen which could specifically elicit m826-like antibodies. Such an approach has been used for developing vaccine immunogens against other viruses, including HIV-1 and MERS-CoV, with varying success (Jardine et al., 2013, Jardine et al., 2016, Steichen et al., 2016, Bonsignori et al., 2016, Schmidt et al., 2015). It appears that it could be most useful for those viruses typically causing acute infections that elicit antibodies with a relatively low number of mutations, but still capable of potent inhibitory activity.",

Furthermore, m826 did not interfere with viral attachment or membrane fusion, as indicated by the imaging-based immunofluorescent assay. This could be explained by the unique epitope of m826, which is located opposite to RBS on the head of H7N9 HA. Surprisingly, m826 elicited more potent ADCC than the stem-binding antibody CR9114, contrary to previous findings that anti-stem antibodies and not anti-head antibodies are able to mediate robust ADCC (Cox et al., 2016, DiLillo et al., 2014). It has been recently proposed that optimal antibody-mediated ADCC is dependent on the interaction between influenza HA and sialic acid receptors on immune cells, and thus anti-head antibodies that block sialic acid receptor interactions of HA inhibited Fc\u03b3RIIIa activation and ADCC elicitation (Cox et al., 2016). In this regard, it is likely that the epitope of m826 was not masked, or even became more exposed, on the binding of HA to sialic acid receptors, allowing the subsequent m826 binding and elicitation of potent ADCC.",

According to our in vitro assays, such binding apparently does not interfere with viral entry. Nonetheless, more experiments are required before we can identify with certainty whether the better exposure of the m826 epitope could be induced by the binding of HA to sialic acid receptors, and plays a role in the elicitation of potent ADCC by m826.",

About 1012 phage particles were used for each biopanning.

In brief, 293 T cells expressing H7N9 HA (2.5\u00d7104 cells/well in 25 \u03bcl) as the target cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed culture plate. A measure of 50 \u03bcl of serially diluted antibody was added to the culture plates. As the effector cells, engineered Fc\u03b3RIIIa-expressing Jurkat T lymphocytes were co-cultured with the antibody-treated target cells at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, and the luciferase activity was then measured using luciferase assay regents and a luminescence counter (Infinite M200 Pro) (Sun et al., 2016). The PBMC-based cytotoxicity assay was performed as previously described with some modifications (Ying et al., 2014b). In brief, target 293T cells expressing H7N9 HA (1\u00d7104 cells/well in 25 \u03bcl) were mixed with 50 \u03bcl serially diluted antibody for 30 min. Human PBMCs, as the effector cells (5\u00d7105 cells/well in 25 \u03bcl), were co-cultured with antibody-treated target cells at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Then ADCC activity was measured using CytoTox-ONE Homogeneous Membrane Integrity Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. A minimum of 3 independent experiments was performed.",
