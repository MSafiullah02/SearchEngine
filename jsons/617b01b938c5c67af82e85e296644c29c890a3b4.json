Blood samples were taken approximately 60 d after the outbreak. Antibody levels were quantified as the sample-to-positive ratio (S/P ratio) using a fluorescent microsphere assay. Reproductive traits included total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number stillborn (NSB), number mummified (NBM), and number born dead (NBD). Mortality traits were log transformed for genetic analyses. Data were split into prior, during, and after the disease outbreak phases using visual appraisal of the estimates of farm-year-week effects for each reproductive trait. For NBA, data from all phases were combined into a reaction norm analysis with regression on estimates of farm-year-week effects for NBA. Heritability for S/P ratio was estimated at 0.17 \u00b1 0.05. Heritability estimates for reproduction traits were all low and were lower during the outbreak for NBA but greater for mortality traits. TNB was not greatly affected during the outbreak, as many sows that farrowed during the outbreak were mated prior to the outbreak. Heritability for TNB decreased from 0.13 (prior) to 0.08 (after). Genetic correlation estimates between prior to and during the outbreak were high for TNB (0.86 \u00b1 0.23) and NBA (0.98 \u00b1 0.38) but lower for mortality traits: 0.65 \u00b1 0.43, \u22120.42 \u00b1 0.55, and 0.29 \u00b1 1.39 for LNSB, LNBM, and LNBD, respectively. TNB prior to and after the outbreak had a lower genetic correlation (0.32 \u00b1 0.33). In general, genetic correlation estimates of S/P ratio with reproductive performance during the outbreak were below 0.20 in absolute value, except for LNSB (\u22120.73 \u00b1 0.29). Based on the reaction norm model, estimates of genetic correlations between the intercept and slope terms ranged from 0.24 \u00b1 0.50 to 0.54 \u00b1 0.35 depending on the parameterization used, indicating that selection for the intercept may result in indirect selection for steeper slopes, and thus, less resilient animals. In general, estimates of genetic correlations between farm-year-week effect classes based on the reaction norm model resembled estimates of genetic correlations from the multivariate analysis. Overall, compared to previous studies, antibody S/P ratios showed a lower heritability (0.17 \u00b1 0.05) and low genetic correlations with reproductive performance during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak, except for the LNSB.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) severely affects both the breeding and growing sectors of the swine industry. In the breeding sector, PRRS causes abortions, stillborns, mummified piglets, pre-weaning mortality, and embryonic death . It was estimated that $302 million (~45%) out of the annual $663 million in costs associated with problems caused by PRRS are due to losses in the breeding sector (Holtkamp et al., 2013) . This was very different than estimates from a previous study by Neumann et al. (2005) , where only ~12% was due to breeding herd losses. A relatively large amount of work has been done on the growing pig sector to reduce the economic impact of PRRS (Lunney et al., 2011) and less attention has been focused on reducing the effects of the disease in breeding herds . One reason is that, prior to the availability of high-density genotyping, genetic analyses required a pedigree, which is typically not available for sows at the commercial level due to pooling of semen. Because nucleus and multiplier herds are managed to maximize biosecurity and minimize the risk of exposure to major pathogens such as PRRS, studies on outbreaks in herds with pedigreed sows are rare. Although pedigrees are not required with genomics, genotyping is still relatively expensive, and it still requires high-quality data, which is typically collected in nucleus herds. It is also much more expensive to set up experimental infection trials for reproductive traits in sows, as done in the PRRS Host Genomics Consortium nursery pig trials (Lunney et al., 2011) .

After suspect abortions, samples were sent for diagnostics and the 1-7-4 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern (strain) of PRRS was confirmed by PCR analysis. This strain is a highly virulent strain. A nearby farm first broke with this PRRSV strain. To protect some high indexing sows in farm 1, they were preemptively sent to a quarantine facility to be tested for PRRS. After clearing these tests, these sows were then transferred to one of the other farms to farrow. Farm 1 was confirmed positive on March 5 and was then depopulated to try to protect other nearby farms 2 and 3. Subsequently, farms 2 and 3 broke with PRRS and were then closed to new animals.

(2014 Ser\u00e3o et al. ( , 2016 is the use of different antibody assays for semi-quantification of antibody levels. The IDEXX PRRS X3 ELISA (at the same lab) was used in both Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) and Serao et al. (2016) , while the Luminex (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) microsphere assay was utilized in the present study. Although the IDEXX is considered an industry/research gold standard for measuring PRRS antibody (Sattler et al., 2014) , the microsphere (or microbead) assay is rising in popularity because the Luminex multiplex system allows for the detection of numerous analytes within a single biological sample, saving cost, time, and labor (Lin et al., 2011) . The Luminex assay was also used by the same lab in the study of Hess et al. (2018) on nursery pigs following experimental PRRSV infection, resulting in a moderate-to-high heritability estimate. The microbead assay is not a traditional ELISA but is conceptually similar to an indirect ELISA, as both measure antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (inside the complete PRRS virus). Lin et al. (2011) compared an earlier version of the standard single plex ELISA (IDEXX Herdchek PRRSV 2XR kit) and the microsphere-based immunoassay and found the spearman rank correlation to be 0.72 for PRRS antibody. The sensitivity and specificity between the assays were 91% and 93% for PRRS in young pigs, respectively (\u03ba coefficient of 0.67). Commonly, young pigs are used for testing and validating assay results for several reasons (cost, ease of sampling, availability, etc.).

Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al. (2014) used the newest IDEXX (HerdChek PRRS X3), the same test used in Ser\u00e3o et al., (2014 Ser\u00e3o et al., ( , 2016 . Adults pigs (sows and boars) may have higher background reactivity than young pigs (Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al., 2014) , possibly due to a more mature immune system and antigens seen later in life and will need to be investigated further. Although we do not have direct evidence that the differences in variance components estimated between the present study and Ser\u00e3o et al., (2014 Ser\u00e3o et al., ( , 2016 can be attributed to the differences between the IDEXX and Luminex platform, it should be a major consideration in future research, along with the age of the animal being tested. There are several other possible reasons for the difference in estimates of genetic parameters for S/P ratio between the current and previous PRRS outbreak studies. These could include other aspects of the assay such as in-house diagnostic target variations, time of year, the strain of the virus, sample processing, and other unknown environmental effects. In contrast to Ser\u00e3o et al. (2014) , sows in the current study were inoculated 3 wk after the confirmed outbreak, followed by MLV vaccination. Vaccination is not expected to impact antibody levels at 40 d after inoculation, as a secondary type of response in a relatively short time after infection is not expected due to the persistency of infection of the PRRS virus discussed below) . However, it still could contribute to differences. Typically, antibody response studies in pigs are conducted in designed experiments with one injection given simultaneously to all animals. In a natural disease challenge, this consistency is lost and sows in a large farm are consistently re-exposed to antigens, some possibly due to \"rebound\" animals (Boddicker et al., 2012) . In Ser\u00e3o et al. (2016) , antibody levels were measured on gilts following acclimation across many commercial farms, which represented a range of times following exposure, either through infection or MLV vaccination, again strengthening the idea that some of these other factors may not play a large role.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 68, "end": 86, "text": "Ser\u00e3o et al.

PRRS can be a persistent infection and, thus, it is possible that PRRS still affects reproductive performance after the outbreak has cleared, perhaps subclinically. Lunney et al.

Multivariate analyses may also not be able to disentangle causes if multiple pathogens are involved in the infection. In Herrero-Medrano et al. (2015) , both PRRS and a coronavirus caused outbreaks that led to a high challenge load (described by Mathur et al., 2014) of over 15 index units (the challenge load). The reaction norm model treats both of these outbreaks being very similar traits (in terms of regressor values, here the FYW effects), when in fact they most likely have different genetic backgrounds in terms of genetic resistance. For example, two FYW effects around \u22121 NBA may be the result of separate environmental changes; one could be the result of porcine epidemic diarrhea and the other from heat stress for example. Any FYW effect would be a combination of any management environments and challenges/stressors. Regardless of this, given enough data, these models should still result in sows that are more resilient/robust to environmental challenges. The advantage of the reaction norm is that it would average over all of these effects in one parsimonious model without regard to specific causes. Knap and Su (2008) stressed the need to have large datasets for reaction norm models to be effective. The optimal breeding objective should include general resilience/robustness to any number of stressors, including different diseases, not to single diseases or stressors. Therefore, for the reaction norm models to be effective, it would be advantageous to have a large number of environments classified from many different farms with as many different management practices as possible, such that the values used to regress on capture as many stressors and different environments as possible (Knap, 2005) . When thinking about testing a sire, it would be best to have as many daughters in as many different farms/environments as possible. One issue is that there can be high leverage on the slope of the reaction norm slope for extreme FYW observations (Pool et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 406, "end": 435, "text": "Herrero-Medrano et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 559, "end": 588, "text": "Herrero-Medrano et al.

Therefore, it can be dangerous to interpret these estimates, as was done by Knap and Su (2008) . Another factor that can influence the (co)variances is using different contemporary group sizes (week, month, or season). Knap and Su (2008) utilized estimates for herd-year-season contemporary groups instead of herd-year-week contemporary groups used in the current analysis. The estimate of the genetic correlation between the intercepts and slopes from the three parameterizations used in the current study was different (as expected), although all were positive. This indicates that selection for improved NBA of animals with the standard animal model (related to the reaction norm intercept) would result in animals with greater reaction to changes in the environment.

Knap and Su (2008) found EBV from the multivariate animal model and EBV for the intercept terms from the reaction norm to be correlated 0.78 to 0.85, similar to the current analysis, which found correlations between 0.75 and 0.82 (for prior, during, and after for NBA). EBV from the reaction norm model at different levels of FYW was also correlated with EBV from the multivariate model. EBV from the reaction norm between \u2212-2 and +2 were moderate to highly correlated with EBV from the multivariate analysis (between 0.64 and 0.80). The highest correlation between the multivariate EBV and the EBV at \u22124 from the reaction norm was for NBA during the outbreak, as expected (0.38), however, this was at the very extreme of the outbreak phase. The EBV for the slope from the reaction norm was negatively correlated with the EBV at \u22124 (\u22120.55) and strongly positively correlated with EBV at 2 (0.91), which is as expected. Animals with EBV for the slope that deviate from zero are considered sensitive to environmental changes. Therefore, the optimum selection would be for animals with a high EBV for the intercept and an EBV for the slope close to zero, indicating high producing animals that produce uniformly (in ranking) across environmental gradients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 181, "text": "(Knap and Su, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 410, "end": 428, "text": "Knap and Su (2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reaction Norm Model"}, {"text": "The reaction norm can capture more than just health, which may contribute to the difference in genetic correlations observed between the multivariate and reaction norm models. Guy et al. (2012) discussed resilience to not only health challenges but also other environmental challenges. In commercial data, challenges for pigs can encompass social, environmental, metabolic, immunological, and human interactions (Mart\u00ednez-Mir\u00f3 et al., 2016) . Seasonality encompasses effects of heat stress and disease and both affect FYW estimates. For instance, there is a positive seasonality effect during the summer months for pigs weaned/sow/ year (Stalder, 2017) . Sevillano et al. (2016) showed that seasonal infertility can be impacted by photoperiod and not just by ambient temperatures. So, as long as data are captured over long periods of time and plenty of heterogeneous environments, the reaction norm should also be thought of as general resilience, instead of only disease resilience. Of course, the multivariate model could also pick up effects from other stressors. Bishop and Woolliams (2014) stated that the requirement to measure resistance phenotypes is a rate-limiting step in breeding for disease resistance. One problem for both the multivariate and reaction norm models is that it is difficult to get enough records in the diseased phase to obtain accurate EBV for disease resilience; most of the information for either model will come from correlated data, i.e., from the \"healthy\" phase in the multivariate case. For the reaction norm model, most data are from healthy weeks when an outbreak has not occurred for an extended period of time. For instance, in farm 1 of Herrero-Medrano et al. (2015) , only one outbreak occurred over a 6-yr span of the data and only five total outbreaks occurred in the three farms. The reaction norm is only observed on part of the FYW estimates for many animals, especially because many sows are culled early (especially in nucleus environments), although this is partially overcome by the use of the pedigree relationships. The use of random regression models for a reaction norm is different from many other situations in which random regression models are used for genetic analyses, such as milk yield in dairy cattle, growth or feed intake in pigs, and egg production in poultry. In those situations, animals have repeated records that span most of the lactation, growth period, or egg-laying cycle, leading to more accurate estimates of breeding values than obtained for the sparser reaction norm model (Knap and Su, 2008 ). In the current study, sows had between one and four records for the reaction norm model. Meyer (2005) stated that using higher order polynomials when a substantial proportion of animals have fewer records than the order of polynomials fitted can lead to erratic and implausible estimates. One should be careful before applying complex models to this type of data. The total range in estimates of NBA FYW effects was 6.43 on the original scale. A total of 47%, 70%, and 89% of sows had phenotypes in contemporary groups that ranged <0.5, 2.0, and 3.0, respectively, in NBA FYW effects (i.e., the x-axis). This may contribute to the poor accuracy referred to by Knap and Su (2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 193, "text": "Guy et al.

Novel strains of PRRSV are continuing to show up because of the high mutation rate of the PRRS virus and predictive ability in terms of genetic correlations should be regularly checked. Antibody tests continue to change over time and differences among labs exist, although the HerdChek PRRS X3 antibody test seems to be very repeatable within and across labs (Kittawornrat et al., 2012) . This possible instability over time in other antibody assays such as the Luminex (or future IDEXX assays) is risky for implementation into the swine breeding industry. One important validation needed is to send samples to multiple veterinary diagnostic labs and with multiple tests (e.g., IDEXX vs. Luminex) to verify results for each test and each lab to make sure genetic analyses agree. Perhaps even lab replicates will need to be performed to determine the repeatability.

Standard errors for variance component estimates were large because of a relatively small dataset and lowly heritable traits, so no strong conclusions can be drawn. More research will be needed to understand why these results did not completely validate previous findings on S/P ratio heritability and genetic correlations with reproductive performance. It is possible that the differences in the antibody assay were the cause, but this is still unknown. The genetic correlation between reproductive performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was high for both TNB and NBA. The only negative genetic correlation between performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was for LNBM. TNB had a genetic correlation of 0.32 between prior to and after the outbreak. It may be useful to consider reproductive performance several months after the outbreak as a separate trait from performance prior to the outbreak, as sows farrowing after the outbreak were bred during the outbreak. The reaction norm model for NBA showed similar trends in genetic correlations as the multivariate model that considered reproductive performance prior, during, and after the outbreak as separate traits, although it considered data from prior and after the outbreak as having overlapping environments.
