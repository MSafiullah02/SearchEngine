We used it as the upper bound of Y(t) in sensitivity analysis. We set the date December 8, 2019, the presence time of the first pneumonia of unknown etiology, as t = 0. In fact, t might be slightly earlier than December 8, since the symptoms might have appeared for some time before to the hospital. Hence, the estimated basic reproduction number might be a bit higher by using December 8, 2019 as t = 0. Based on the above analysis, we mainly used Y(48) = 2820 from the People's Daily Reports, and Y(43) = 4050, Y(47) = 12 700 form the Northeastern University Reports. 2 The value of for SARS was in the range of [0.5, 0.8], we took = 0.65 in the absence of more studies. 3,9 In the sensitivity analysis, we would consider from 0.5 to 1. As the formula (1 \u2212 ) was symmetry, the range, that is, [0.5, 1], covers all possible values of . Lipsitch et al 10 showed that the average of T g is 8.4 days for SARS, while in the early outbreaks T g was higher (the average value was 10.0 days), and they suggested the sensitivity analysis interval as T g \u2208 [8, 12]. Imai et al 11 claimed that the case study reported in Chan's research 4 indicated that 2019-nCoV has a much shorterT g . However, we could not yet obtain any solid estimation about the value of T g as the number of samples was too small and the questionnary survey did not sufficientlycover the interests about genration time. Therefore, we mainly concentrated on T g = 8.4(days) and T g = 10.0 (days), and took sensitivity analysis with the same interval 8,12 as suggested by Lipsitch et al.10", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "shows the sensitivity analysis of the three key parameters. Under the worst case (Y(48) = 28 016, = 0.5, T g = 12), the estimated R 0 was 5.2; under the best case (Y(48) = 2820, = 1.0, T g = 8), the estimated R 0 was 2.3. Because R 0 was sensitive to the generation time, with the accumulation of epidemiological survey data, the estimation of generation time would be more accurate, thus providing a more precise estimation of the basic reproduction number. 4 DISCUSSION Considering the extreme cases, the basic reproduction number was in the range of [2.3, 5.2], but we thought it should be in the range of [2.8, 3.9]. Based on the data of the People's Daily Reports, the prediction of the basic reproduction number was in the range of 2.8 and 3.3, and this range became [3.2, 3.9] when the data were based on the Northeastern University Reports. 2 Even with the pessimistic estimation, the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was only slightly higher than SARS, fully equipped with controllable condition. Many known basic reproduction numbers were higher than 2019-nCoV, for example, Zika virus was 1.4-6.6 , 14 Middle East respiratory syndrome was 2.0-6.7, 15 and smallpox was 3.5-6.0. 16 In other words, 2019-nCoV does not have particularly outstanding transmissibility. The value of basic reproduction number was most sensitive to the generation time T g , and thus we hope the more accurate estimation of the generation time based on the accumulation of epidemiological survey data would further improve the quality of the estimation of R 0 . The number of confirmed cases obtained from different sources varied widely. Since a significant proportion of patients with 2019-nCoV had mild symptoms, which could be healed without entering the hospital, there might be a large number of patients not in the official confirmed list. Consequently, we suggested it to be more prudent. For example, the design of control measure should refer to the more pessimistic estimation (based on the Northeastern University Reports) rather than the more optimistic one (based on the People's Daily Reports).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "was a preliminary estimation under the premise of largely insufficient data. In order to have a better estimation of the basic reproduction number and effective reproduction number, as well as predicting the trend of epidemic transmission, we not only need to know precise epidemiological determinants, but also need to improve the model itself by further considering the diversity in susceptibilities and contact probabilities of people in different ages and genders, the different spreading mechanisms in hospitals and communities, the effects of regional population density and human mobility, and so on.[17][18][19][20] .From the dynamic perspective, R 0 = k D, where k is the average number of contacts to susceptible individuals of an infected individual per day, is the transmission probability through a contact between an infected individual and a susceptible individual, and D is the effective time period allowing an infected individual to infect susceptible individuals. The government's control policy and individuals' prevention behaviors were to reduce these parameters, and to eventually make the effective reproduction number R t below 1. According to our results, if k D could be reduced by 3/4 (to its 1/4), 2019-nCoV could be effectively controlled. Staying at home and cancelled meetings could decrease the frequency of contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. Wearing masks and washing hands could reduce the transmission probability . If the individuals exhibit the suspected symptoms or have contacts with the high-risk groups, the corresponding medical observation and the isolation with other individuals were needed, which would shorten the effective infectious time period D. Restrictions on transportation, extension of winter holiday, and the cancellation of various conferences also aimed at reducing the effective reproductive number.
