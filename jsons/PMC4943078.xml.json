Pathogens evolve quickly, allowing them to jump from multiple host species to humans (e.g. SARS coronavirus or Ebola virus; Woolhouse et al. 2005), to become more virulent and evade immune pressure within humans (e.g. influenza virus; Grenfell et al. 2004) and to become resistant to drugs used to combat them (WHO 2014d). In particular, drug resistance results in numerous deaths, increased hospitalizations and prolonged treatments (WHO 2014d). In addition to the costs borne by human health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate the economic costs of drug resistance to be on the order of tens of billions of dollars a year in the United States alone (CDC 2011). While pharmaceutical intervention has played a critical role in our efforts to control epidemic pathogens, there is an urgent need to understand the evolution and spread of drug resistance.",

Pathogen populations with large sizes, high mutation rates and short generation times are likely to generate drug resistance mutations in a short amount of time. Pathogens also encompass a wide variety of organisms that include eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. This means that our efforts to understand how pathogens evolve drug resistance need to account for factors such as: variable genome sizes [ranging from a few kilobases (Kb) in RNA viruses to many megabases (Mb) in Plasmodium falciparum], variable mutation rates (from 10\u22129 per base pair per generation in eukaryotes to 10\u22125 in some RNA viruses), alternative methods of genetic exchange (including viral re\u2010assortment and horizontal gene transfer in bacteria) and clonal vs. recombinant forms of reproduction (see Box 1 for more on diverse modes of genetic exchange and recombination). In addition, the scale at which drug resistance evolves varies widely. For example, in HIV drug resistance mostly evolves within patients and is rarely transmitted (Wheeler et al. 2010), whereas in other pathogens (e.g. malaria), drug resistance is often transmitted between hosts, making certain drugs ineffective for a large fraction of new patients (Hyde 2005).",

However, evolutionary biologists have traditionally left most of the study of drug resistance to the medicine and epidemiology communities (Read & Huijben 2009).

This change is, at least in part, driven by the availability of genetic data for a variety of pathogens. A new cross\u2010disciplinary field is emerging that uses large amounts of genetic data and new theoretical advances from the world of population genetics. Some of this work is directly aimed at finding ways to prevent drug resistance evolution or spread, whereas other work is more basic in nature and mostly uses the pathogen as a model system to learn about evolution in general. In the best cases, we learn lessons on how to prevent resistance and on general evolutionary principles simultaneously.",

Perhaps more importantly this review is intended as an advertisement of the strengths of using natural pathogen populations to study evolutionary principles as well as the strengths of using evolutionary theory to better understand the dynamics of infectious diseases. To this end, we present five case studies at the intersection of evolutionary theory and pathogen drug resistance. While the five examples we have chosen are not meant to be exhaustive in any way, each example showcases an evolutionary question in the context of a different pathogen, each with a unique biology and differences in genome size, methods of genetic exchange, reproduction and recombination (see Box 1).",

            "text": "We will describe the following five examples:\n\nSelective sweep mapping in the malaria parasite P. falciparum resistant to the antimalarial drug artemisinin. This is a great example of how population genetic methods originally developed for other sexually recombining eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, could be applied to P. falciparum, which experiences a very high rate of sexual recombination. The mapping of the drug resistance mutations in P. falciparum has allowed researchers to track the prevalence of artemisinin resistance worldwide.\nThe role of epistasis in oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistance in influenza. The evolution and spread of oseltamivir resistance in influenza in 2007\u20132008 was unexpected. Even though the causal mutation for oseltamivir resistance was known, it was thought to be too costly to viral fitness to spread widely. Phylogenetic methods allowed researchers to discover mutations that interacted with the resistance mutation to ameliorate its detrimental effects, allowing the resistance mutation to spread. Influenza has become a model that helps researchers understand the importance of genetic interactions between sites during the course of evolution and the potential for predicting future evolution.\nThe importance of standing genetic variation (SGV) (also referred to as minority variants) to treatment failure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Drug resistance mutations are well known in HIV and the evolution of drug resistance happens independently in different patients. This makes it possible to determine the importance of SGV for drug resistance in HIV. Several studies found that both SGV and de novo mutations contribute to drug resistance in HIV.\nClonal interference dynamics in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Drug resistance mutations are also well known in M. tuberculosis. Through tracking these mutations, recent studies have revealed that clonal interference plays a large role in the evolutionary dynamics within patients. An examination of these dynamics offers insights into how multiply\u2010resistant strains emerge and also provides a rare look into a natural population evolving without recombination.\nPopulation structure analysis of the core and accessory genome of methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus aureus reproduces clonally, yet drug resistance is often acquired via the spread of mobile genetic elements (or horizontal gene transfer), such as the gene cassette SCCmec that confers methicillin resistance. While the genealogy of the core genome of MRSA reveals that relatively few lineages have spread across the globe, phylogenetic analysis of SCCmec reveals that methicillin resistance arises on a more local scale.\n",

This locus was later characterized as the kelch13 locus (Ariey et al. 2014). These three studies benefited greatly from deep samples of P. falciparum from multiple populations, some of which displayed the artemisinin drug resistance phenotype of slow parasite clearance rate while others did not (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009). This data allowed the authors to contrast genomic patterns in strains from geographical locations displaying the slow parasite clearance rate phenotype vs. those that did not.",

This data set offered the opportunity to contrast the Thai and Cambodia samples with Laos to discover putative loci conferring resistance to artemisinin. Cheeseman et al. (2012) utilized a two\u2010step approach to identify genomic regions underlying resistance to artemisinin. First, the authors used the XP\u2010EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007) and FST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) statistics and identified 33 regions as significant candidates under selection in at least one population. These statistics were particularly appropriate for their multipopulation data set because they are designed to contrast genomic signatures in two populations (Box 2). Cheeseman et al. (2012) found that 10 of the 33 regions discovered were associated with positive selection in studies examining different drugs, validating their approach. Second, Cheeseman et al. (2012) examined the associations of these 33 regions with the slow parasite clearance rate phenotype and identified two adjacent single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 14 kb apart in their sample on chromosome 13 showing significant associations. Cheeseman et al. (2012) then performed fine mapping in this region and applied the EHH statistic (Box 2) to visually confirm the extended haplotype homozygosity pattern in a 35\u2010kb region on chromosome 13 characteristic of a selective sweep.",

The authors used efficient mixed\u2010model association (EMMA, see Box 2) (Kang et al. 2008) to test the association of each SNP in their data set and the parasite clearance phenotype, thereby identifying four SNPs significantly associated, including two on chromosome 13. In conjunction with the association test, Takala\u2010Harrison et al.

The authors found that only the polymorphisms on chromosome 13 previously identified with the EMMA test also had significant XP\u2010EHH and FST values. Takala\u2010Harrison et al.

Upon closer examination, the authors found that three of four clusters of P. falciparum found in western Cambodia showed slow parasite clearance rates, slow decay in LD, and loss of haplotype diversity, while the fourth cluster prevalent in northeastern Cambodia did not show any of these characteristics. This leads the authors to conclude that western Cambodia harbours at least three distinct populations of artemisinin\u2010resistant P. falciparum. In particular, one of the subpopulations with resistant strains of P. falciparum showed a single haplotype extending across half of chromosome 13, corroborating the evidence from Cheeseman et al.

(2014) were able to identify causative mutations with high confidence. Ariey et al. (2014) used an in vitro drug selection technique to subject a parasite line to high doses of artemisinin for 5 years. Comparing the sequenced data from the selected line with that of a clonal population not experiencing any selection, the authors identified eight mutations in seven genes that were present in the artemisinin treatment group but absent from the control group. Ariey et al. (2014) narrowed their list of candidates and concluded that only the mutation appearing in the kelch gene on chromosome 13 appeared at the same time as when artemisinin resistance developed in their treatment group. To determine whether there was concordance between the presence of this mutation in the kelch gene and artemisinin\u2010resistant parasites from Cambodia, Ariey et al. (2014) sequenced the locus at which these mutations were present in parasite samples from patients showing the drug\u2010resistant phenotype and from patients who did not in different geographical locations in Cambodia. They found that mutations in the kelch gene were strongly associated with the slow clearance phenotype observed in the locations where malaria is prevalent. In this extended analysis, Ariey et al.

Ghorbal et al. (2014) used the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system to introduce a mutation (C580Y) implicated in artemisinin resistance (Ariey et al. 2014) into kelch, which produced the slow parasite clearance phenotype and demonstrated the first direct link between a mutant kelch and the characteristic phenotype.

As a eukaryotic pathogen with a high rate of recombination, sequence analysis of the P. falciparum genome was amenable to traditional genome scan approaches. Clever stratification of the samples gave additional power to the genomic scans, and in combination with novel experimental methods, researchers were able to find a locus under recent strong selection that was responsible for the evolution of resistance to artimisinin. The identification of the kelch gene by population genetics methods offers a clear example where standard methodologies to identify selective sweeps are powerful in identifying a causal locus. Given that P. falciparum can be manipulated experimentally to confirm computational predictions, this organism is an attractive choice for future studies of drug resistance, especially since malaria continues to be a costly disease and new drug\u2010resistant loci may be unknown.",

Epistasis in drug resistance evolution has been characterized by several in vitro studies, including the case of the five interacting mutations involved in cefotaxime resistance in Escherichia coli that produce predictable mutation orders (Weinreich et al. 2006) and the hundreds of interacting mutations that determine viral fitness in antiretroviral resistance in HIV (Hinkley et al. 2011).",

Taken together these results suggest that epistasis had a profound impact on the evolution of resistance to oseltamivir and allowed the H274Y resistance mutation to spread through the global population. This work also provides cautionary evidence for the clinical assessment of drug resistance mutations. Secondary mutations that interact epistatically with drug resistance mutations are important factors that need to be incorporated when making predictions about the epidemiological consequences of drug resistance mutations. Knowing that even deleterious drug resistance mutations can spread when they emerge on permissive backgrounds tells us that we should pay close attention to identifying and monitoring potential epistatic interactions during virological surveillance.",

A sequence of the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes are used to determine whether any drug resistance mutations are present at high frequencies, and if so, these results help the clinician and patient choose a combination of drugs with which to start treatment (Hirsch et al. 2008). If the majority of the viral population in a patient carries a resistance mutation, then this information will be used to choose a drug regimen that will work for the specific virus. However, drug resistance mutations at low population frequencies (at 20% or less) are not detected by standard sequencing protocols (Simen et al. 2009). An important question therefore is whether this low\u2010frequency SGV is present in most patients, and if so, whether it allows the viral population to adapt and evolve drug resistance.",

Treatment failure is defined as having virus detectable in the blood at levels higher than should be expected given that the patient is on treatment. The authors focused on two important resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene, K103N and Y181C, because the patients were treated with a combination of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In 73 of the 183 patients, they found that either K103N or Y181C was already present as a minority variant (mostly around 1% frequency), but they could not detect the mutation in the other 110 patients. Of the patients with the minority variant, treatment failed in 26 but was successful in 47. Out of the patients without the minority variants, treatment failed in only 16 but was successful in 94. Altogether, treatment failed in 23% of the 183 patients. When only considering the patients without detectable SGV, treatment failed in 15% of the patients.

We found that in the study of interest, resistance evolution happened at a constant rate in the second and third year of treatment. In both of those years, the virus acquired resistance in 3.5% of the patients who previously had a virus without drug resistance. Such a constant rate of evolution of drug resistance was also observed in several other trials (e.g. UK Collaborative Group on HIV Drug Resistance and UK CHIC Study Group and Others 2010). In years 2 and 3 of treatment, SGV that was present before treatment probably plays no role, so the 3.5% likely reflects evolution of resistance from de novo mutations. In the first year of treatment, it is expected that both new mutations and SGV contribute to the evolution of resistance, so if resistance evolved in more than 3.5% of the patients' viral populations, this suggests that SGV played a role.",

In populations with no recombination, each mutation remains on the genetic background on which it originally occurred. Therefore, if multiple positively selective traits enter the population simultaneously on different backgrounds, these traits cannot be recombined to augment each other.

Its large genome size (\u223c4.5 Mb), well\u2010documented drug resistance mutations, and long time course of infection mean that patterns of diversity can be tracked over time.

At the final time point, 94% of the sample had a single drug resistance mutation, and 6% was divided among other drug\u2010resistant strains, including those containing drug resistance mutations not present at the second time point. This suggests that while M. tuberculosis rapidly acquires resistance mutations, different drug\u2010resistant strains compete against each other due to lack of recombination. The second patient entered the study with an M. tuberculosis population fixed for a certain drug resistance mutation (rpoB L533P) but remained sensitive to the antibiotic rifampicin.

In addition to methicillin resistance, which first emerged in the 1960s, there is also a growing number of cases of resistance to other antibiotics, including vancomycin, quinolones, aminoglycosides, streptogramins, oxazolidinones and rifamycins (Lowy 2003; Stryjewski & Corey 2014). MRSA can be particularly deadly. For example, mortality rates for patients with MRSA bloodstream infections has been reported to be \u223c30% (De Kraker et al. 2011). In the USA \u223c94 000 infections and \u223c19 000 deaths per year are caused by MRSA (Stockman 2009). Drug resistance can arise via new mutations within the genome of a single clone (Strahilevitz & Hooper 2005; Howden et al. 2008), via horizontal gene transfer between clones (Coombs et al. 2011) and even via horizontal gene transfer from another bacterial species (Hanssen & Ericson Sollid 2006; Bloemendaal et al. 2010; Malachowa & Deleo 2010; Smyth et al. 2012).

MLST has historically been applied to the core genome, revealing that S. aureus is a highly clonal species with relatively few recombination events in the core genome (Robinson & Enright 2004). When MLST is applied to international collections of isolates, it appears that a small number of clonal lineages are responsible for most infections. For example, Oliveira et al. (2002) applied MLST to over 3000 MRSA isolates from hospitals across Europe, South America, and the USA, and found that just five clones caused 70% of the infections (Oliveira et al. 2002). As findings such as these emerged, it was thought that methicillin resistance was likely to have spread across the population of S. aureus when relatively few clones acquired SCCmec and then clonally expanded (i.e. genomewide sweeps) (Kreiswirth et al. 1993; Cris\u00f3stomo et al. 2001; Feil & Enright 2004).

Interestingly, genetic changes within this gene cassette track successive epidemic waves of MRSA (Katayama et al. 2000; Chambers & DeLeo 2009), and extensive work has been done to investigate the source and spread of this mobile element, both as a phylogenetically informative sequence and as an adaptive factor in its own right.

Both HA\u2010MRSA and CA\u2010MRSA strains are thought to arise when methicillin\u2010sensitive clones newly acquire a SCCmec cassette from a source population, most likely the staphylococcus species S. epidermidis (Wu et al. 1996; Hanssen et al. 2004, 2005; Meric et al. 2015). It has been found that HA\u2010MRSA strains tend to carry the longer SCCmec types I, II, and III elements in just a few clonal backgrounds, whereas CA\u2010MRSA strains tends to carry the shorter SCCmec types IV and V elements in diverse clonal backgrounds (Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011). For example, the early HA\u2010MRSA pandemic could be relatively neatly classified into just five clonal complexes (Musser & Kapur 1992; Fitzgerald et al. 2001; Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003). In contrast, as researchers began analysing the strains responsible for the emerging CA\u2010MRSA health threat, they found these strains to display more diversity and a stronger association between clonal type and geographic location (Chua et al. 2010; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011). As of 2006 the SCCmec type IV element alone was found to have entered at least nine different clonal complexes of S. aureus (Lina et al. 2006).",

A study of MRSA infections in 2004\u20132005 in the city of San Francisco, California, found that \u223c90% of MRSA infections were acquired in the community (Liu et al. 2008). In the United States, there is currently a predominant CA\u2010MRSA clone, called USA300 (typically containing SCCmec Type IV), that is responsible for the vast majority of community\u2010associated infections in addition to causing hospital outbreaks (Seybold et al. 2006; Chambers & DeLeo 2009). Mathematical models predict that these CA\u2010MRSA strains will eventually replace the strains traditionally categorized as HA\u2010MRSA, rendering the community\u2010associated and hospital\u2010associated categories far less useful (D'Agata et al. 2009). The success of these CA\u2010MRSA strains is potentially mediated by the arrival of the SCCmec Type IV cassette, which may be particularly suited to recurrent horizontal transfer because it confers faster growth rates at little or no fitness cost (Okuma et al. 2002; Diep et al. 2008; Chambers & DeLeo 2009; Mediavilla et al. 2012).",

            "text": "As the clinical and genetic differences between CA\u2010 and HA\u2010MRSA strains have eroded in the modern pandemic, so too has the emphasis on their differences within recent literature. Instead, attention is moving towards leveraging new sequencing technologies (Maiden et al. 2014) to achieve higher resolution into the global patterns of methicillin resistance acquisition. Overall, analyses of the core genome of MRSA strains suggest that relatively few methicillin\u2010resistant clones have dispersed widely across the globe (Robinson & Enright 2003), while analyses of the accessory genome of MRSA suggest that new strains emerge locally via frequent de novo transfers of the SCCmec element. In other words, it appears that there has been clonal expansion of relatively few core genomes, while the accessory genome frequently goes through gene\u2010specific sweeps. To illustrate this, Lina et al. (2006) applied MLST to both the core genome and the SCCmec element and found no association between clonal complex background and SCCmec element sequence type. The authors therefore concluded that SCCmec appears to transfer both repeatedly across distinct clonal complexes (particularly in the case of SCCmec IV) and repeatedly within a clonal complex, which suggests that SCCmec spreads through gene\u2010specific sweeps. Chua et al. showed in another study that MRSA from geographically and genetically distant isolates (i.e. distantly related core genomes) can nevertheless have relatively conserved accessory elements, including SCCmec type IV (Chua et al. 2011), which again suggests that transfer happens often and sweeps are gene\u2010specific. Another example is a study by N\u00fcbel et al. (2008) where the authors used an improved sequence typing method of the core and accessory genome to investigate the genetic relationships within a single clonal lineage (ST5, belonging to clonal complex CC5) using 135 isolates from across 22 countries and six continents. In contrast to lower resolution studies that came before, their analyses of the core genome sequences found geographically\u2010associated phylogenetic clades within the ST5 clonal lineage. Additionally, their analyses of the SCCmec sequence revealed that at least 23 independent transfers of SCCmec occurred into this clonal group alone, with acquisitions appearing to occur locally (rather than a single acquisition then disseminating globally; Fig. 6). We could refer to this case of multiple origins of the adaptive SCCmec element as a soft, gene\u2010specific sweep (Pennings & Hermisson 2006). The authors estimate that previous calculations for the rate of SCCmec acquisitions were at least an order of magnitude too low.",

Thus, the growing availability of sequence data and whole\u2010genome sequencing technologies has provided the ability to determine that resistance may generally be unconstrained by global transmission dynamics and instead can be tracked on local spatial scales. This presents researchers with the opportunity to use sequencing as a tool to monitor transmission networks within hospitals to limit the numbers of hospital\u2010acquired drug\u2010resistant infections. Overall, the transmission and repeated evolution of drug resistance in bacterial populations capable of HGT presents important and interesting problems for reconstructing population structure and spatial distributions of resistance.",

However, it is becoming clear that many pathogens can also be excellent model systems. Pathogen evolution as a model evolutionary system has many advantages. Pathogens receive a lot of attention from biomedical researchers, and as a consequence, they are well studied and extensively sampled. Some pathogens already function as model organisms in the lab [e.g., influenza (Foll et al. 2014), HIV (van Opijnen & Berkhout 2005), polio (Acevedo et al. 2014) and E. coli (Toprak et al. 2012)], which allows researchers to assess characteristics of population genetic and epidemiological relevance from laboratory populations, for example the cell surface expression assays that were performed in the previously mentioned study of oseltamivir resistance in influenza. In some pathogen systems, researchers can also apply known selective pressures with precision in a laboratory environment, thus allowing high\u2010resolution measurements of an organism's response to selection. Additionally, because some pathogens evolve drug resistance quickly and repeatedly within patients, there are cases where many replicate evolutionary histories can be studied (HIV, HCV, TB, etc.).",

First, we are expecting more work that bridges within\u2010 vs. between\u2010host dynamics (e.g. Lythgoe & Fraser 2012). This is important because considerable genetic variation is created and selected for within the host; however, the within\u2010host processes of short\u2010lived infections have not yet received sufficient attention. We are expecting more within\u2010host work, including time series and deep samples for pathogens that are traditionally studied at the between\u2010host level. The M. tuberculosis work described in this review is a good example, but new within\u2010patient work on influenza is also being done (Rogers et al. 2015). Second, with deeper samples and more time series, it should become increasingly possible to estimate selection pressures on pathogens and to estimate epistatic interactions between mutations. For some of this work, methods that are currently used for identifying mutations and evaluating selection in viruses grown in cell culture (Lou et al. 2013; Foll et al. 2014) will hopefully find use in clinical samples taken from infected patients. Extending these methods to patient data can potentially give researchers the ability to study the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens within patients over the entire course of an infection.",

Until very recently predicting evolution seemed like science fiction, but recent work is changing our perceptions of what is possible. In addition to the predictive phylogenetic methodologies mentioned in our discussion of epistasis in influenza, a method that uses the shapes of protein phylogenies to predict evolutionary trajectories was evaluated using influenza data (Neher et al. 2014). The work shows that predictability is low when evolution occurs by big steps, but much higher when evolution proceeds by small steps (Neher et al. 2014). Although we tend to fix our attention on large adaptive events, such as drug resistance or immune escape, evolution by small steps may be more common than previously expected (Bhatt et al. 2011; Strelkowa & L\u00e4ssig 2012; Gong et al. 2013). In an organism like influenza where new vaccines are manufactured every year, the application of these and other new predictive methodologies that use population genetics theory (Luksza & L\u00e4ssig 2014) are potentially groundbreaking.",
