It is thought that a relatively short duration antibiotic regimen given once in a lifetime would not significantly increase overall antibiotic consumption. However, this would mean offering antibiotic treatment to the majority of the population in countries with the biggest burden of gastric cancer who would, therefore, have the greatest benefit from such a strategy. So far, no country has implemented an eradication strategy.",

Depending on the scenario that might be chosen, clarithromycin consumption would increase up to sixfold, and amoxicillin consumption would double if the recommendations of the current guideline in the local circumstances was applied. It appears that an increase in commonly used antibiotic consumption cannot be justified from the viewpoint of antibiotic stewardship policies. Solutions to this problem could be the use of antibiotics that are not required for treating life-threatening diseases or more narrow selection of the target group, e.g. young people before family planning to avoid transmission to offspring. Additional costs related to the increase in resistome should be considered for future cost-effectiveness modelling of the screen-and-treat strategy.",

Such a strategy should comply with the principles of good governance and organization, and the benefits should be well-balanced against the risks that any potential intervention could create [12] . Several risks have been suggested for population-based H. pylori eradication; however, the possible adverse effects related to increased antibiotic consumption probably are the most significant. Resistant H. pylori strains are emerging due to high antibiotic consumption [13] . However, the most significant risks will probably be related to induction of resistance in other clinically relevant bacteria than H. pylori and increase the pool of resistant genes in the gut and upper respiratory system [14] [15] [16] .",

Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are the most widely prescribed antibiotics, frequently used in both low and high clarithromycin-resistant regions. According to the guidelines, the clarithromycin-containing regimen is the choice where H. pylori is clearly sensitive to clarithromycin (for individualized treatment) or if H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin does not exceed 15% in the reference population [11] . Although the resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin correlates to the overall use of this antibiotic in a particular population, the choice of treatment solely depends on H. pylori resistance. Furthermore, no differences in the eradication regimen are currently recommended, depending on whether the treatment is given for a clinically evident disease, e.g. for complicated ulcer disease or MALT lymphoma from prevention strategies in population-based settings. The author viewpoint is that negative effects upon the gut microbiome would not be a significant concern in the case of treating patients with a clinically significant disease, yet should be considered in preventive interventions.",

Bismuth quadruple therapy, on the other hand, was not associated with an increase in resistance in E. coli. The authors also demonstrated that for other therapies the resistance rates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to certain antibiotics were restored at week 8 and 1 year after therapy [47] . However, this study focussed only on gut microbiome and effect on resistance rates in Gram-negative bacteria. Widespread use of amoxicillin and clarithromycin causes concern about resistance rates in Gram-positive bacteria such as Str. pneumoniae and S. aureus [48, 49] .",

More profound reduction of the gastric acidity also could contribute to a higher effectiveness of the therapy. Sugimoto and Yamaoka [64] have recently reviewed the effectiveness of PCAB in H. pylori eradication therapies compared to the traditional PPI containing therapies, and demonstrated significant advantages of the PCAB. Therefore, one directions for future therapies could be PCAB and high-dose (multiple dose) amoxicillin in combination.

In avoiding the problems of treating life-threatening diseases due to increased resistome, antibiotics with high potential for resistome induction, and use for treating life-threatening diseases (such as macrolides) should be avoided in populationbased H. pylori eradication regimens for otherwise healthy people. Narrowing of the target groups for the screen-andtreat strategy is desirable, e.g. for young people before family planning and potential transmission of H. pylori to their offspring. Finally, in implementing any screen-and-treat strategy, this should be done under thorough surveillance corresponding to the general principles of screening governance, including surveillance of the incidence of serious infections and all-cause mortality.",
