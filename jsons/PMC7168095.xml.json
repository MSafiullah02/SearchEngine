Patients with ESRD require kidney transplantation or frequent hemodialysis to prevent clinical complications or death due to the buildup of waste products in the blood.\n2\n It is critical to monitor kidney function in pre\u2010ESRD patients to diagnose conversion to the acute disease state. We examined numerous potential renal function biomarkers in the saliva of ESRD patients.

            "text": "In the studies reported here, we have analyzed saliva from ESRD patients and asthmatics to determine whether this sample matrix could be used for systemic disease diagnosis and monitoring. For ESRD, we were able to identify two salivary analytes (NO2\n\u2212 and UA) that were elevated in predialysis patients and were shown to be reduced following dialysis. Detection chemistries for these two analytes have been converted to a colorimetric test strip format for the rapid and facile semiquantitative determination of NO2\n\u2212 and UA in saliva. The test strips have notable advantages over solution\u2010based screening methods, namely the ability to provide instantaneous measurements for two analytes simultaneously in undiluted saliva without expensive instrumentation. We foresee the NO2\n\u2212/UA test strips potentially improving the quality of life for ESRD and especially for pre\u2010ESRD patients, as these individuals could monitor their salivary analyte levels at home, thereby eliminating periodic visits to the clinic and/or invasive blood testing. For asthma, our goal is to elucidate the complex network of proteins and pathogens implicated in pulmonary exacerbations using whole saliva as a diagnostic fluid. By incorporating assays for promising pulmonary inflammation biomarkers into a multiplexed point\u2010of\u2010care platform for saliva, physicians would be able to make better\u2010informed decisions about the cause of exacerbation and appropriate treatment options.",
