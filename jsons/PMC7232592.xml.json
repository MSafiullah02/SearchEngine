The signs and symptoms often manifest within 2 to 14 days following primary exposure [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons or fomites. Aerosol transmission has not been confiremd [2].",

RT-PCR assay sampling of nasopharyngeal secretions was performed according to the protocol established by the World Health Organization (WHO). To collect tear samples, we used disposable swabs. After opening the eyelids, the swab was placed in the lower fornix for at least 10 s in each eye. No anesthesia was used during the procedure. All tear samples were collected by a single ophthalmologist (AA). All nasopharyngeal and tear specimens were stored at 4 \u00b0C and were immediately sent to the same laboratory for processing.",
