            "text": "Brown algae have long been used traditionally as foodstuffs and folk medicines in Asian countries. Recently, a commercially available Ecklonia cava extract was approved as a new dietary ingredient (NDI) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 (FDA-1995-S-0039-0176). Marine algae have been identified as rich sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds with great pharmaceutical and biomedical potential. Eckolina cava (Laminariaceae) is an edible brown alga that grows abundantly in the subtidal regions of Jeju Island, Korea. E. cava is used to produce food ingredients, animal feed, fertilizers, and folk gynecopathic medicines.1\nE. cava contains a variety of compounds, including carotenoids, fucoidan, and phlorotannins, that show different biological activities.2, 3 The phlorotannin components, which are oligomeric polyphenols with phloroglucinol units, are responsible for the pharmacological activities of E. cava.4 Ecklonia species have been used extensively as traditional medicines for the treatment of goiter, scrofula, urinary diseases, stomach ailments, hemorrhoids, boils, constipation, and postpartum women.5 Previous studies have presented a wealth of evidence showing that E. cava exhibits antioxidant,6 anticancer,7 immunomodulatory,8, 9 and tyrosinase inhibitory activity.10\nE. cava also exhibits anti-virus activities against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase11 and influenza virus neuraminidase.12 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of the phlorotannins from E. cava eliciting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) inhibitory activity.",

We characterized the anti-SARS-CoV 3CLpro effect of isolated phlorotannins from E. cava using cell-free cleavage and cell-based cleavage assays. To examine the trans-cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the cell-free assay, the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro was tested against a fluorogenic substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) and analyzed with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The cis-cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was determined with a cell-based assay; the in-frame construction of 3CLpro, the substrate (SAVLQSGFRK), and luciferase (Luc) was transfected into the Vero cells, and the cis-cleavage activities of SARS-CoV 3CLpro were determined using a luciferase assay. We also assessed the effect of the inhibitor on the SARS-CoV 3CLpro interaction using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and a binding model.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) depends on a chymotrpsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) to process the translated polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This enzyme is a target for potential anti-SARS drugs. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a naturally derived SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor for use as anti-SARS drug. Our first step toward this goal was to expressed and purified SARS-CoV 3CLpro from E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells as described in Section 2. The purified protease ran at approximately 33 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulface\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) with greater than 90% purity. The purified 3CLpro from Escherichia coli cells had a specific activity of 32.0 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcM towards the Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans substrate.",

First, we examined the effect of nine phlorotannins 1\u20139 on the cell-free SARS-CoV 3CLpro\ntrans-cleavage assay. The percent inhibition at 200 \u03bcM concentrations of compounds 1\u20139 was initially determined, and the results are reported in Table 1\n. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2\nA, all of the phlorotannins investigated, except phloroglucinol (1), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on 3CLpro hydrolysis with IC50 values ranging from 2.7 to 164.7 \u03bcM against cell-free 3CLpro\ntrans-cleavage. As the concentrations of the inhibitors were increased, the residual SARS-CoV 3CLpro activity decreased dramatically. All inhibitors exhibited a similar relationship between enzyme activity and enzyme concentration. As an example, the relevant data for dieckol (8) is illustrated in Figure 2B. Plots of the residual enzyme activity versus enzyme concentration at various concentrations of dieckol (8) yielded a series of straight lines with an axis intercept of 0, indicating that all inhibitors are reversible. Augmenting the concentration of dieckol (8) reduced the slopes of the lines. Of the isolated phlorotannins, eckol (3, IC50\n = 8.8 \u03bcM) and dieckol (8, IC50\n = 2.7 \u03bcM) displayed remarkable inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro cell-free cleavage.",

            "text": "The inhibition activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure. Initially, we compared a closed-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (3, eckol) with an opened-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (2, triphloretol A), and we found that the activity of eckol (IC50\n = 8.8 \u03bcM) was 20-fold higher than that of the trimer itself (IC50\n = 164.7 \u03bcM). Replacement of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group by a dioxinodehydro group (4, IC50\n = 158.3 \u03bcM) led to weaker inhibition compared to 3; however it was still more active than 2. Similar to this relationship, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenyl group on the opened-chain trimer that formed a biaryl linkage tended to increase the activity (7, IC50\n = 22.5 \u03bcM vs 2, IC50\n = 164.7 \u03bcM). However, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group of eckol yielded the tetremeric phlorotannins 4\u20136 with reduced activities. When we compared a series of phloroeckols (5 and 6), we found that introduction a 3,5-dihydrophenoxy substituent at the 2C-position of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group (phloro-) increased the inhibitory activity \u223c3-fold; 2-phloroeckol (5) had an IC50\n = 13.3 \u03bcM and 7-phloroeckol (6) had an IC50\n = 42.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, blocking of one of the hydroxy units (C7) on the A ring, which contains a five-membered closed ring, appear to exert a variable (9, IC50\n = 16.7 \u03bcM) but not insignificant effect on the activity. As evidenced from the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibition data, the eckol structure is essential and crucial for good inhibition of 3CLpro. Most importantly, we found that dieckol (8), which possesses two eckol groups linked through a diphenyl ether, showed the most potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity (IC50\n = 2.7 \u03bcM). In addition, the inhibitory effect of dieckol (8) was comparable to that of a naturally derived quinone-methide triterpene (IC50\n = 2.6 \u03bcM), which we isolated during our previous investigation on 3CLpro inhibitors from Tripterygium regelii. 24 Dieckol (8) showed 30-, 50-, and 60-fold greater activities than the positive control, hesperetin (60 \u03bcM), daidzein (105 \u03bcM), and aloeemodin (132 \u03bcM), respectively, previously reported by Lin and co-workers.22 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the biological activities of phlorotannins isolated from E. cava toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

The enzymatic activity was measured with a series of substrate concentrations and various inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fit to all of the possible kinetic models. As shown in Figure 2C, the kinetic plots show that dieckol (8) has competitive inhibition profiles because the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot (1/V vs 1/[S]) is a series of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. All of the isolated inhibitors exhibited the same mode of action for inhibition. The K\ni values in Table 1 were calculated from the Dixon plots, which are useful for determining the K\ni value of the inhibitor (see Supplementary data Fig. 4S). The predominant inhibition mode shown by the naturally occurring viral enzyme inhibitors was noncompetitive. Interestingly, the inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CLpro by the phlorotannins isolated from E. cava was rarely competitive, encouraged us to further investigate this phenomenon with a more detailed biological study.",

All of the tested phlorotannins, except 1\u20133, exhibited dose-dependent cell-based SARS-CoV 3CLpro\ncis-cleavage inhibitory activities. In the cell-based cleavage assay, the isolated phlorotannins 4\u20139 inhibited the cis-cleavage activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with IC50 values ranging from 68 to 177 \u03bcM (Fig. 3\nand Table 2\n) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, all of the phlorotannins were non-toxic to Vero cells with CC50 values greater than 200 \u03bcM. Active phlorotannins were less effective when evaluated with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro\ncis-cleavage assay than when evaluated by the cell-free trans-cleavage assay. The explanation for this result may be that several of the compounds cannot permeate the cellular membranes to reach the intracellular SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The cell-based assay indicated that dieckol (8, IC50\n = 68.1 \u03bcM) is the most efficient at blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CLpro, which agreed with the cell-free cleavage FRET assay data. Dieckol (8) showed a strong correlation between the effects on the cell-free and cell-based cleavage of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. In particular, dieckol (8) was more efficient at blocking the cleavage of 3CLpro than indigo, sinigrin, beta-sitosterol, and aloeemodin, which were previously reported plant-derived phenolic compounds.22 Although diekcol (8) is considerably less effective than hesperetin (IC50\n = 8.3 \u03bcM),22 it is the first report of a phlorotannin chemotype dieckol (8) that significantly blocks the cleavage of a SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

In this study, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was immobilized on the sensor chip, and the most potent 3CLpro inhibitor, dieckol (8), isolated from E. cava was passed over the sensor\u2019s surface. To analyze whether dieckol\u2019s (8) interaction is due to a specific binding event, the SPR sensorgram of the compound was recorded at several different concentrations. The binding responses in resonance units (RUs) were continuously recorded and presented graphically as a function of time. The association was described by a simple equilibrium of the A + B \u2194 AB type (A, analyte; B, ligand; and AB, complex). The SPR sensorgram was used to determine the kinetic binding parameters, the association rate constant k\non [\u03bcM\u22121\n s\u22121] and the dissociation rate constant k\noff [s\u22121]. For SARS-CoV 3CLpro, diekcol (8) increased the SPR sensorgram in a significant and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4\nA). The dissociation constant K\nD (k\noff/k\non) was calculated by globally fitting the kinetic data at various dieckol (8) concentrations (12.5, 25, and 50 \u03bcM) to the Langmuir binding model (K\nD\n = 10.3 \u03bcM). The K\nD for the dieckol (8) interaction was thus simulated as a classical type of interaction (several analyte concentrations flowed serially across an immobilized ligand with a surface regeneration step between each infection)34 with k\non\n = 73.5 \u03bcM\u22121\n s\u22121 and k\noff\n = 0.000843 s\u22121, which quantitatively revealed a higher association rate than that of hesperetin (K\nD\n = 24.5 \u03bcM) (see Supplementary data Fig. 7S).",

Most poignantly, dieckol (8), which possess two eckol groups linked by a diphenyl ether, showed the lowest binding energy of \u221211.51 kcal/mol.

Simulating the docking interactions between dieckol (8) and the amino acid residues in the active site of 3CLpro revealed that dieckol (8) bound to the S1 site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro through H-bonds. Additionally, we confirmed that dieckol (8) formed especially strong hydrogen bonds to the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.

Recombinant SARS-CoV 3CLpro was expressed E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) by transforming the pET23d(+)-SARS-3CLpro to produce a C-terminal fusion with six histidine residues. The expression and purification of SARS-CoV 3CLpro were performed as previously described.26, 27 Briefly, cells were grown in 1 L of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicilline at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 reached 0.5 and were then induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 8 h at 16 \u00b0C. After centrifugation at 6000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C for 25 min, the pellet was washed, frozen, and suspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). The suspended cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-affinity chromatography throughout the procedure. The protein in the final column fraction was dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.5) with 1 mM dithiothreitol and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 562 nm using the BioRad protein assay. The purity and molecular weight of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was verified by SDS\u2013PAGE. The purified protease ran approximately to the calculated size of 33 kDa on SDS\u2013PAGE.",

The transfected cells were incubated in Dulbeccos modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine serum (FBS) for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, the media was removed and replaced by DMEM containing the tested compounds at different concentrations. After 5 h of incubation, the activity of luciferase in the cell lysate was measured using the dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA) and a Luminometer Centro XS3 LB 960 (Berthold Technology, Inc.). Because the greater than 33 kDa protein fused to the N-terminus of luciferase remarkably decreased luciferase activity,30 the detection of luciferase activity was considered a measure of the cis-cleavage by the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.22\n",

The surface was activated with a 7 min injection of EDC/sulfo-NHS mixture at 200/50 mM concentration. The protein was diluted to 100 \u03bcg/mL with 20 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and injected for 10 min. The active sites were quenched with 1 M ethanolamine buffer at pH 8.0 and washed with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.2 (PBS). The binding surface was stabilized with 3\u20135 blank injections of PBS. PBS was used as a running and sample dilution buffer for all of the experiments. The tested inhibitors were first prepared as 20 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted into PBS immediately prior to the experiments. Analyte binding was analyzed using automated runs of the twofold dilution series and two \u2018zero concentration\u2019 injections. Regeneration steps were performed using 10 mM NaOH. The data was analyzed with the Scrubber2 software. Referenced and blanked binding dissociation curves were fit globally to a two-state binding kinetics model.",
