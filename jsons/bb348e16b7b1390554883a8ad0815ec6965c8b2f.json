In addition to the public health response, a concerted research effort is necessary to better detect, understand and respond to these threats. Such research requires development of environmental detectors and clinical diagnostic aids to provide us with rapid warning in the event of an outbreak as well as development of vaccines to prevent infection and antiviral or antibacterial drugs to cure infection. These efforts require a comprehensive biological understanding of potential threat agents, including their molecular biology, genetics, pathogenicity, epidemiology and evolution. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as well as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintain a list of priority pathogens that are considered potential biothreat agents and/or are microbes that appear to be new or * reemerging pathogens (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlistcategory.asp and http://www.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_ priority.htm). Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox and a member of the Poxviridae family of viruses, has perhaps the greatest potential for use as a bio-weapon and is one of the Category A pathogens on these priority pathogen lists (1) . In addition, monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus genus that includes variola virus, has caused a number of disease outbreaks in recent years, including outbreaks in North America resulting from the importation of rodents from Africa intended to be sold as pets (2, 3) .",

Therefore, one overarching necessity in research efforts directed at providing a better understanding of priority pathogens is the need to collect, manage, describe, analyze and publicize the vast amounts of information generated by modern, high-throughput biological research. Therefore, the goal of the Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center (PBRC) is to organize all available information on virus genetics thus aiding research efforts towards increasing our knowledge of virus replication and virus-host interaction on a gene-by-gene and whole genome basis. In addition, the PBRC is expanding on available knowledge by developing and utilizing analysis tools that can further probe the information contained in the genome and gene sequences of these organisms. Since our goal is to establish an information resource to support research efforts by the scientific community, we are also soliciting input from that community to ensure the completeness and, above all, the accuracy of the information being provided and to ensure that the software tools provided and in development reflect the needs of the different research groups using these resources.",

The PBRC consortium has established a database of all available completely sequenced poxvirus genomes. This database includes information on every predicted gene that may be coded for by these genomes, as well as descriptive annotations of the physical and functional properties of each gene based on computer predictions. Currently, only complete genomes are included in the database. In future releases we plan to include as available, incomplete genomes as well as coding sequences from virus strains not represented by complete genomic sequences. We are also compiling a comprehensive gene-by-gene curation that is linked to each individual gene record. In addition, the PBRC provides a variety of analytical information and analysis tools that can be used to mine the genomic data. These tools include sequence homology searches, a database of functional domains, a database of poxvirus gene orthologs and webbased visualization tools to allow for customized displays of much of this information. A major goal has been to develop new software packages for the analysis of viral genomes. This aspect of the project involves designing new software tools that permit researchers to interact with and manipulate complete poxvirus genomes and families of poxvirus protein orthologs. This vastly speeds up the analysis process and provides information about these viruses from comparative analyses that otherwise would be almost impossible to obtain. Some of these tools have been described previously in the literature and therefore more substantial descriptions are already available [Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters (4,5), Viral Genome Organizer (6), Viral Genome Database (7), JDotter (8) and Base-By-Base (9)].",

The PBRC data schema provides tables to store sequences and basic sequence annotations, human-annotated curation records and tables for the storage of basic analytical information such as the results of BLAST searches, functional motifs and biophysical properties.

If available from the GenBank record or from the sequencing laboratory, the predicted gene set of any one genome is stored in the PBRC database and used as the initial starting point for annotation and curation of each genome. If a predicted gene set is not available, we perform our own gene prediction using a combination of gene predictive tools that start with open reading frames, and then include among others, promoter prediction, presence of functional motifs and assignment to orthologous protein clusters. Our experience is that the methods used for the prediction of protein coding genes for each poxvirus genome present in GenBank has in many cases been derived using different parameters. Therefore, we are in the process of developing a more consistent method for the prediction of poxvirus genes and will utilize this gene prediction pipeline to reassess the gene set for each available genome.",

The annotation process starts with the GenBank record and includes the descriptive information, literature references and any other information provided in that record. This information populates the initial descriptive fields of our database. Following this automated annotation process, a manual, human-directed curation of each gene record is undertaken. During this curation process, a researcher reviews the annotation record, all available literature references and any unpublished information as available. This collection of empirically derived properties for the protein in question provides what might be considered a mini-review of the biology of the gene being studied. The broad types of information that are provided during the curation process include protein properties such as molecular weight and pI; post-translational processing; the availability of custom reagents such as clones, antibodies and mutants; functional descriptions [including Gene Ontology designations (16) ]; and literature summaries. Evidence codes are provided that explicitly state the nature and source of each piece of information along with the appropriate literature references. A series of web forms assist in this process that provides a distinct set of informational fields to be filled in, and enforces use of a controlled vocabulary to fully describe each gene.
