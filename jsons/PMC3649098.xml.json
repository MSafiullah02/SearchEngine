The story of zinc began when an Iranian physician presented to me at the medical center grand rounds, a 21-y-old man who looked like a 10-y-old boy and who was severely anemic. His genitalia were infantile. He had rough and dry skin, mental lethargy, hepatosplenomegaly, and geophagia. He ate only bread (whole wheat flour) and had no intake of animal protein. He consumed 0.5 kg of clay daily. He was severely iron deficient but had no blood loss. Later, I discovered that this syndrome was common in the villages of Shiraz, Iran (3).",

We hypothesized that a high phosphate content in the diet and geophagia may have decreased the availability of both iron and zinc, which resulted in deficiency of both elements (3).",

The 2 women lived in the house of Dr. Ronaghy and received the same treatment and observation program.

The serum zinc concentration was significantly decreased. They, therefore, administered oral zinc sulfate to correct this deficiency. Surprisingly, the skin lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms cleared after zinc supplementation. When zinc was inadvertently omitted from the child\u2019s regimen, the child suffered a relapse; however, she again completely responded to oral zinc therapy. The authors attributed zinc deficiency to the synthetic diet that the patient received. The authors, however, soon realized that zinc might have been fundamental to the pathogenesis of this rare inherited disorder and that the clinical improvement reflected correction of the zinc status in the patient. This original observation was quickly confirmed in other patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) throughout the world. The underlying pathogenesis of the zinc deficiency in these patients is due to malabsorption of zinc caused by a mutation in ZIP4, an intestinal zinc transporter (20).",

LPS binds to Toll-like receptor 4 on DCs and initiates Myd88 and TRIF [a domain containing adapter\u2013inducing interferon (IFN)-\u03b2]-mediated signaling (39). TRIF-mediated signaling increases the ZnT (a solute carrier )-5 mRNA and decreases ZIP-6 mRNA, thus resulting in a decrease in the intracellular free zinc in DCs. Reduction in intracellular free zinc increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, which is important for the activation of CD4+ T cells (39, 40).",

Zinc inhibits the membrane phosphodiesterase, leading to elevated levels of the second messenger guanosine 3\u2032,5\u2032 cyclic monophosphate, which is followed by a subsequent suppression of the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)\u2013dependent mRNA of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other inflammatory cytokines (40\u201342).

Growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, hyperammonemia, abnormal dark adaptation, and cell-mediated immune dysfunction in SCD patients have been related to a deficiency of zinc. The biochemical evidence of zinc deficiency in SCD patients was decreased levels of zinc in the plasma, erythrocytes, and hair; hyperzincuria; decreased activity of certain zinc-dependent enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes, alkaline phosphatase in the neutrophils, deoxythymidine kinase activity in newly synthesizing skin connective tissue and collagen; and hyperammonemia (54, 55). Inasmuch as zinc is known to be an inhibitor of RNA, increased activity of this enzyme in plasma was considered to also be evidence of zinc deficiency. Zinc supplementation in SCD patients resulted in significant improvement in secondary sexual characteristics, normalization of plasma ammonia level, and correction of dark adaptation abnormality. Zinc supplementation also increased zinc levels in plasma, erythrocytes, and neutrophils. The expected response to zinc supplementation in enzyme activities was also observed. Increased longitudinal growth and body weight in 14- to 18-y-old SCD patients were observed. Zinc supplementation also corrected impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and decreased natural killer cell lytic activity in SCD patients (21, 54, 55).",

Third, the chemical formulation should be optimal so that zinc is ionized in the oral cavity at pH 7.4. Zinc acetate and zinc gluconate are good salts to use; however, if citric acid, glycine, tartarate, and other binders are used, zinc is prevented from ionization. Thus, it is critical that the solution chemistry of the preparation is proper. Physicians and health practitioners must realize that one cannot treat common cold symptoms by swallowing zinc tablets, zinc syrup, or zinc lozenges.

Zinc plays an important role in NF-\u03baB activation. However, the regulation of NF-\u03baB activation by zinc is cell specific. Zinc is required for NF-\u03baB DNA binding in purified or recombinant NF-\u03baB p50 protein of the T helper cell line. Additional studies also showed that zinc decreased LPS-, ROS-, or TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation in endothelial cells and cancer cells (46). We reported previously (44) that compared with controls, healthy volunteers who were supplemented with zinc (45 mg/d) had a significant decrease in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA and TNF-\u03b1 induced NF-\u03baB DNA binding in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and zinc upregulated the expression of A-20 in HL-60 cells. In this study, we observed that zinc decreased oxLDL-induced generation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and VCAM-1, oxidative stress markers, and activation of NF-\u03baB and increased A20 and PPAR-2 proteins in human monocytic and vascular endothelial cells. We propose that zinc inhibited NF-\u03baB activation by inducing A20, a transactivating factor that played a role in reducing IL-1\u03b2\u2013 and TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced NF-\u03baB activation. A20 inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling via TNF receptor\u2013associated factor pathways in endothelial cells (45).",

It was shown that neurons were activating microglia to release IL-1, which in turn activated astrocytes and caused them to release S100, a soluble astrocyte Ca-binding protein with proinflammatory effects. Thus, it appears that IL-1 and S100 are associated with AD (96). IL-1 was shown to upregulate the production of \u03b2APP in cord blood and brain; thus, excess inflammatory cytokine IL-1 was a driving force in neurodegeneration and genesis of amyloid plaques (96).",

I hypothesize that similar phenomenon may be taking place in zinc-deficient elderly subjects such that microglia cells are being oxidatively stressed due to zinc deficiency leading to upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 in brain cells. Increased IL-1\u03b2 in turn could upregulate the generation of AB and tau proteins and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, leading to formation of neurofibrils and damage to neuronal cells. If this hypothesis is correct, one would see an effective prevention of AD in zinc-deficient elderly patients who are supplemented with zinc (45 mg/d elemental zinc) to correct their deficiency. This hypothesis needs to be tested. If correct, zinc supplementation may prove to be a very important therapeutic adjunct of AD.",
