The TD strengthened moving northwestward as it received a large amount of vapor from the sea, and moving northward, it transformed into a typhoon at 965 hpa central pressure on 13th. Then it moved northward to Jeju Island on September 15, moved along the sea, and reached almost southern Yeosu-si where it was 120 km apart from the typhoon. After, it moved northeastward and reached Chungmu-si2 and moved along from Pohang-si to the southern sea of Ulleung Island. On the 18th, it passed the center of the East Sea and northern Hokkaido and headed to the Sea of Okhotsk where it damaged Jeju Island, Yeongdong area,3 and southern region of Korea from the 15th to the 18th. Typhoon Sarah caused about 750 casualties and loss of 9329 ships, 12,366 houses, roads, bridges, telephone booths, and 216,325 ha of farmland; the total economic loss was estimated at 62.2 billion KRW (297.2 billion KRW of 2015).",

In cost-cutting measures, rebar and concrete were reduced, shoddy workmanship was employed, and safety measures were ignored to complete the construction of the project ahead of schedule. Additionally, the Mapo-gu Office and the police office received an emergency call but failed to act upon a notification of impending collapse.

The cause of the accident was instability due to an overload. Its center of gravity became higher, which made the ship unstable, and there was a sinking followed by an overturn. The passenger capacity of the ferry was 302, but the actual number of passengers was 338. Moreover, the loading capacity was 150 tons, but the actual loading was almost 500 tons. Also, at the moment of the sinking accident, the belated response of the rescue agency on SOS was another factor leading to more damage and deaths. As a result, there were 326 deaths or missing persons, and the property damage was 170 million KRW (2.27 billion KRW of 2015) including the ship and the freight (NEMA 2009).",

Vilfredo Pareto, the Italian economist, revealed that the amounts and frequencies of personal wealth follow these polarized patterns in his study on the distribution of social wealth in 1896 (Pareto 1896). Auerbach (1913) also unveiled the fact that the sizes and frequencies of urban populations bear a linear relation on the log-log scale. The two variables that bear a linear relation on the log-log scale can be expressed like (3.2).

The population of the city and intensity of the earthquake also follow the power-law distribution (Farber 2003).

The death toll and economic loss due to natural disaster provided by YND (1979\u20132015) include most natural disasters in Korea; however, YSD (1995\u20132015) does not provide detailed data about all types of social disaster. In addition, the data in the YSD is incomparable between disaster and minor accident. In addition, the ministry or agency that is mainly responsible for each type of social disaster does not have a database about death toll or economic loss due to social disaster. The most credible data source about social disaster that is available is the book titled 60 Year History of Disaster Management published in 2009 by NEMA. Therefore, the 60 Year History of Disaster Management is the primary data source of social disaster for this book, and the YSD will supplement it.
