            "text": "In 2015, the subject area of viruses and disease is particularly pertinent, since we live at a time when viruses are regularly in the news. This is exemplified by the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa and, at the time of writing, the importation of infections into Europe and the USA. Such events act as timely reminders of the potential for viruses to cause global disease and it is fitting that our first article deals with filoviruses. Zaki and colleagues have produced a tour de force, describing what Ebola and Marburg viruses are and how and why they are so highly pathogenic in humans. As two of the most virulent human pathogens yet discovered, this review presents what is currently known about filovirus epidemiology, modes of transmission, entry and spread, and the complex way in which these viruses induce disease through multiple effects on the immune system and endothelium 3. In the first of two reviews on coronaviruses, Grolinski and Baric discuss the importance of the innate immune response in the development of lung pathology following human coronavirus infection, whilst van den Brand, Smits and Haagmans review the available clinical and pathological data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and how these inform our understanding of both the different pathological effects of these viruses and their responses to interferon\u2010based therapies 4, 5. Staying with the theme of emerging infectious diseases and viral zoonoses, de Wit and Munster review the pathogenesis of encephalitis and vasculitis caused by the outbreaks of Nipah virus. They focus on dissemination of the virus through its host, current knowledge of the determinants of pathogenicity and the routes of zoonotic and human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, emphasizing the key role played by animal models in advancing our understanding of this virus and the diseases it causes 6. Karst et al review the molecular pathology of norovirus (the cause of \u2018winter vomiting disease\u2019), one of the main causes of acute gastroenteritis, but also now appreciated as causing chronic effects and extra\u2010intestinal spread 7.",

            "text": "Mumps and measles are two of the oldest\u2010recognized infectious diseases and have been the subjects of intensive worldwide vaccination programmes. It has been suggested that it may be possible to eradicate measles virus (MV), and even though this is probably not feasible for mumps virus (MuV), huge advances in reducing the disease burden have been achieved for both. Despite these successes, these viruses continue to cause human disease in both the developing and the developed world. Rubin et al have combined their expertise to review the renewed interest in mumps pathogenesis arising from the resurgence of this disease in the highly vaccinated populations in Europe and the USA. They emphasize the need to develop clinically\u2010relevant animal models of disease, which are necessary to ensure that unsafe vaccines are not licensed 10. In addition, Ludlow et al provide an up\u2010to\u2010date review of measles pathogenesis. They highlight how recent advances in understanding virus\u2010receptor usage explains why the virus infects both epithelial and immune cells and how the inter\u2010related, and opposing, effects of these two distinct tissue tropisms modulate disease 11. These reviews are followed by articles that provide an in\u2010depth analysis of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. In the first of these, Pickles and DeVincenzo review the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis caused by RSV, with a particular emphasis on the cytopathological effects of viral infection on columnar cells, leading to the pathological sequelae of bronchiolar obstruction and inflammation 12. The review on influenza by Kuiken et al discusses how the olfactory system acts as an important conduit for virus spread to the central nervous system. Using data from human and animal infections, they provide compelling evidence that many viruses use this route and discuss current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved 13.",

In their review of CMV, Griffiths et al discuss how epidemiology, and molecular and cellular pathology, account for the variable clinical aspects of CMV\u2010associated disease and how the host immune responses designed to control the virus contribute to immune impairment 14. In their review of varicelloviruses, Ouwendijk and Verjans include an up\u2010to\u2010date analysis of both human and animal infections. These studies, using an excellent animal model of disease and targeted pathology approaches driven by macroscopic imaging, have been highly informative in progressing our understanding of the pathogenesis of varicella and herpes zoster in terms of primary infection, latency and reactivation 15.",

            "text": "The idea that viruses can cause cancer is more than a century old 16 and it is now well recognized that a number are responsible for human cancer 17. In this Annual Review Issue, we have six articles that provide updates on the mechanisms involved in virus\u2010induced cancers and the potential for targeting these viruses therapeutically. There are three reviews on Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). The first article, from Vockerodt et al, reviews recent insights into the mechanisms of EBV\u2010associated lymphoma development 18, whilst Lo and colleagues re\u2010evaluate the mechanisms by which EBV causes epithelial malignancies 19. F\u00e5hraeus et al provide an update on the mechanisms through which EBV establishes latency without evoking immune responses, and how these processes might be exploited as targeted therapy for EBV\u2010associated malignancies 20. Feltkamp et al provide a comprehensive review of the role played by \u03b2\u2010human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in human basal and squamous carcinomas of the skin, and their synergy with immunosuppression and exposure to UV radiation 20, contrasting with the more well\u2010defined relationship between \u03b1\u2010HPV types and cervical and other squamous cancers. Ringelhan et al provide a timely update on the role of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which involves both direct effects of viral gene expression and indirect effects of infection 22. Finally, but by no means least, Gramolelli and Schultz discuss recent advances in identifying and understanding the mechanisms by which Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated virus causes the unusual vascular tumour after which it is named, with an in\u2010depth discussion of the viral proteins that are responsible 23.",
