In humans, the immune system is ubiquitously distributed within all organs and consists of humoral and cellular components organized in highly complex dynamic social network architecture-like structures [1]. Key functions of the immune system embrace injury control in inflammation/infection and tumor recognition/surveillance [1]. Despite its paramount importance, however, the immune system or \u201cimmune organ\u201d is mostly overlooked on intensive care units (ICU) today [2\u20137]. This may at least partly be due to the fact that its functional status cannot be adequately assessed by use of routine biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or numerical distribution of leukocyte (sub)-sets. Nevertheless, numerical assessment of leukocyte (sub-)populations may provide important additional information, e.g., when considerably deranged [8\u201310].",

            "text": "The typical initial immune system response to critical illness consists of systemic and local release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines and activation of specific immune and other cells. This may lead to distinct phenotype changes in immune cells [4, 6, 11, 12]. The traditional understanding was that uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) would determine adverse clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock [4, 11]. Consequently, anti-inflammatory such as anti-TNF-\u03b1 or anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) strategies were then tested in large-scale clinical trials. However, respective trial results returned negative or indicated increased intervention-related mortality. This highlighted that an anti-inflammatory approach would not provide general benefits for larger populations of patients with sepsis/septic shock [2\u20135, 7, 12]. Thereafter, immune status characterization in larger patient cohorts using novel biomarkers allowed for a more profound understanding. When looking at an individuals\u2019 immune response, a high inter-individual variance and highly dynamic changes can be observed over time (Figs. 1 and 2) [4]. Today, it is well established that many critically ill patients either show signs of co-existing inflammatory and counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory response early in critical illness [13, 14] or will undergo transition from early pro- to later anti-inflammatory phenotypes (Fig. 2) [2, 4, 7, 11, 12]. The \u201cnet effect\u201d (i.e., the resulting phenotype) of such profound anti-inflammation was referred to as \u201csepsis- (or injury-) associated immunosuppression (SAI/IAI)\u201d and embraces diminished release of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduced phagocytosis, and reduced expression of cellular surface receptors involved in antigen-presenting activity (e.g., major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II) (Fig. 3) [4, 7, 11, 12]. This may be associated with enhanced immunological tolerance, increased immune cell apoptosis, and altered gene expression profiles [6, 11]. Interestingly, recent data show that respective changes are not exclusive to circulating immune cells and that comparable anti-inflammatory phenotypes can be found, e.g., in splenic or lung tissue and other solid organs [11].\n\n\n",

IL-6 is expressed by monocytes/macrophages, endothelial lineage cells, and fibroblasts and augments immune responses via induction of T cell activation, B cell proliferation and differentiation, and stimulates acute phase protein release (e.g. C-reactive protein) [38]. Systemic IL-6 is detected rapidly with peak serum levels observed after about 2 h after an inflammatory insult [38]. IL-6 is usually assessed via automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in specialized laboratories or via point-of-care tests (blood, liquor) [39, 40]. Owing to its fast induction and short half-life, serial IL-6 assessment may provide timely monitoring of an inflammatory burden when, e.g., compared to serial C-reactive protein measurements. Although increased IL-6 levels indicate adverse clinical outcomes in adults with sepsis/septic shock [38], implementing of IL-6 measurement in routine diagnostic work up was not shown to improve patient-centered clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, IL-6 was shown useful for sepsis diagnostics in neonatal/pediatric critically ill patients [41].",

Phagocytosis of neutrophils may be conserved in patients with sepsis, while in parallel, other neutrophil functions including chemotaxis and/or generation of oxidative burst may be impaired [49]. In general, phagocytosis assays are heterogeneous with varying specificity. Standardized laboratory protocols are missing, resulting in high intra- and inter-lab variation.

            "text": "HLA-DR is a MHC class II molecule and predominantly expressed on monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells [29]. Its surface expression is indispensable for antigen presentation [29]. While increased HLA-DR expression reflects activation of immune cells, diminished expression thereof exhibits a phenotype with downregulation of antigen-presenting capacity and a shift from pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokine production [4, 12]. Surface expression of HLA-DR on monocytes/macrophages is crucial for initiation of adaptive immune responses [11, 29]. This signal is paralleled and/or augmented by activation of co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40- CD40-ligand binding) (Fig. 3). Given the importance of monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) expression in respect to induction of adaptive immune responses, the key interplay of monocytes and dendritic cells with T cells was colloquially referred to as \u201cimmunological synapsis.\u201d Assessment of mHLA-DR expression was thus proposed to serve as a \u201cglobal\u201d functional marker of immune function [4, 5, 7, 12]. In fact, the significance of mHLA-DR expression was first described about 30 years ago in patients undergoing organ transplantation when patients with low HLA-DR expression could be weaned from iatrogenic immunosuppression without transplant rejection [50].",

A recent comparison of the conventional method with the standardized quantitative assay for mHLA-DR (given in mAb/cell) performed by us revealed that the (earlier) cut-off value of 30% HLA-DR positive monocytes corresponds to about 5000 mAb/cell and 45% mHLA-DR to about 8000 mAb/cell [51]. The range between 30 and 45% HLA-DR positive monocytes was termed \u201cborderline immunosuppression.\u201d Thus, a cut-off value of 8000 mAb/cell may be used to indicate SAI/IAI and was used in subsequent interventional clinical trials [58]. Importantly, not single diminished values of mHLA-DR should be regarded as clinically relevant but rather the persistence of low mHLA-DR levels indicating failure for recovery [4, 7, 12, 15].",

Reduced mHLA-DR expression on admission [59, 60], days 1\u20133 [15, 45, 60] and days 6\u20138, [45, 59, 61] was significantly associated with increased mortality. Some studies show that the outcome-relevant difference in mHLA-DR expression is apparent only on days 3\u20134 (or later) with mHLA-DR returning to normal levels in survivors but not in non-survivors [15, 62]. Two further studies showed that the dynamic change (or recovery slope) in mHLA-DR expression between days 3 and 7 post injury is associated with mortality [15, 61, 62]. In one of these studies, it was shown that despite non-significant predictive value for single mHLA-DR values at time points 0, 3, and 7, the delta value between measurements days 0\u20133, 0\u20137, and 3\u20137 were highly predictive for mortality [62]. These results were confirmed in both adult [45] and pediatric patients [61]. One explanation for the better predictive value of relative changes in mHLA-DR expression than absolute values may be the high inter-individual variability of HLA-DR levels on monocytes. Monocytic HLA-DR expression on days 3\u20135 and 6\u20138 also independently predicts development of secondary infections [63]. Recovery of mHLA-DR may also reflect normalization of key metabolic pathways in sepsis [64\u201366], but further large-scale clinical data is needed.",

Culprits for post-surgical immune suppression may be surgical trauma, related intraoperative hypotension [67], and increased perioperative release of corticosteroids or catecholamines [68]. Moreover, anesthetic drugs such as fentanyl [69] may contribute to injury-associated immunosuppression (IAI). In patients with cardiovascular surgery, use of extracorporeal circuits is typically associated with a substantial pro-inflammatory response [16]. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be followed by IAI reflected by impaired monocytic ex vivo LPS-induced cytokine release and decreased mHLA-DR [16, 70, 71]. The nadir of mHLA-DR was typically observed on postoperative days 1\u20133, but diminished mHLA-DR expression was shown to persist up to postoperative day 10 in a considerable number of patients [70, 71]. In two larger studies investigating the predictive power of mHLA-DR on outcome in pediatric and adult patients post-cardiac surgery, reduced mHLA-DR expression on postoperative day 3 was associated with increased length of ICU stay/mechanical ventilation and development of postoperative sepsis [71, 72] after adjustment for bypass time, cross clamp time, complexity of surgical procedure, and a pediatric mortality risk score [72]. In adults, mHLA-DR expression on postoperative days 1\u20135 was significantly different between patients who later developed sepsis vs. with an uncomplicated course and was a factor with a high discriminatory power to identify patients with infection post cardiac surgery [16]. In patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms, mHLA-DR expression after surgery was significantly associated with mortality although this was not related to increased postoperative infection rates [73].",

In particular, pneumonia is associated with worse neurological outcome and remains a leading cause of death. Experimental studies demonstrate that CNS injury-induced suppression of cellular and humoral immune functions contribute to the high incidence of infections [24]. Several clinical studies demonstrated reduced mHLA-DR expression in patients after cerebral ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, or neurosurgery [76\u201378]. Importantly, CNS-injured patients with subsequent infectious complications showed lower mHLA-DR levels than those with an uncomplicated clinical course as early as day 1 after the insult and well before onset of infection [76\u201378] indicating that impaired host responses contribute to an increased infection risk after CNS injury. Very recently, we confirmed in a large prospective multicenter study stroke-induced immunosuppression (as indicated by low mHLA-DR expression) as an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia besides the known neurological risk factors leading, e.g., to dysphagia and higher risk of aspiration [77].",

Despite decreased mHLA-DR expression in AKI patients when compared to controls, the study did not identify a predictive value for mortality [23]. Few studies investigated mHLA-DR expression in patients with acute or decompensated chronic liver disease [22, 83]. Respective studies found a significant association between mHLA-DR expression and mortality at admission with an increase in predictive value when dynamic changes over time were investigated [83]. The discriminatory power of mHLA-DR for prediction of mortality was either similar [83] or lower than for the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score [22].",

Clearance of infection may be enhanced by IFN-\u03b3 use in adult patients with invasive fungal sepsis [87], and in a randomized double-blind clinical trial in trauma, a decreased incidence for ventilator-associated pneumonia was observed in patients with mHLA-DR < 30% receiving inhaled IFN-\u03b3 [74]. IFN-\u03b3 treatment was shown to reverse SAI resulting in higher TNF-\u03b1-, decreased IL-10, and increased mHLA-DR levels indicating reversal of the SAI phenotype [44].

In addition to reversal of SAI (as defined by mHLA-DR expression > 15,000 mAb/cell), we observed improvements in relevant patient-centered outcomes such as shortened time of mechanical ventilation [58]. The finding that GM-CSF reverses SAI is supported by other groups [86]. Whether clinical endpoints such as secondary infection rates are affected by therapeutical application of GM-CSF is under research (NCT02361528).However, smaller studies showed promising results with lower infection rates [88] or shorter duration of infection in immunosuppressed critically ill patients treated with GM-CSF. In another randomized-controlled trial in patients with sepsis and severe respiratory dysfunction, oxygenation significantly improved in patients receiving GM-CSF [89]. In newborns, we could recently demonstrate that reduced mHLA-DR expression may reflect immunological immaturity in very early newborns [90] and a meta-analysis on GM-CSF therapy indicated increased survival rates in very-low pre-term infants (< 2000 g) and infants with neutropenia when treated with GM-CSF [91].

In sepsis, bacterial infections trigger numerous pathways resulting in activation of key antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (i.e., monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells). Activated APCs predominantly express pro-inflammatory cytokines and present antigens bound to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II complexes (such as HLA-DR). Antigen-bound HLA-DR triggers T-cell-receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory molecule (e.g. CD 40-CD40L) binding. Adaptive immune responses are initiated resulting in clearance of infection. In, e.g., cases of overwhelming infection, deactivation of monocytes, as in sepsis-associated immunosuppression (SAI), may occur. SAI is characterized by a shift towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype with predominant expression of IL-10 and diminished HLA-DR expression, resulting in impaired clearance of infection and increased mortality.
