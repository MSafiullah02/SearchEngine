Mask efficacy was found to be variable. Classification of mask efficacy is with particle filtration efficiency (PFE) or bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). PFE ratings refer to the mask's ability to trap particles with a fixed nonviable particle size of 0.1 to 1.0 \u03bcm. BFE ratings are correlated to the mask's ability to trap viable particles of 1 to 5 \u03bcm. The catalogs of 2 large dental supply companies showed 61 and 70 different clinical masks. Although the cost per mask varied between $ 0.20 to $1.09, there was no correlation between PFE or BFE and mask cost. Other dental supply catalogs list masks predominantly by BFE. It is doubtful whether many dental practitioners are aware of PFE and BFE ratings as measures of mask efficacy. The masks in this study were those used in the principal investigator's office, because of familiarity with the manufacturer's name and advice of supply representatives. Based on our results, masks with PFE or BFE of at least that of the N-95 are advisable (95% filtration rate at 0.3 \u03bcm). PFE and BFE ratings and the efficacy values we determined are independent of mask adaptation. Facial hair and the adaptation of the mask to the operator's face also affect protection levels.34 Finally, mask users must be aware that viruses are significantly smaller than 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm and are commonly aerosolized.26 Thus, clinicians should consider the use of high-speed suction during all debonding procedures, but reduction of aerosolized viruses by high-speed suction has yet to be verified.",

The diameters of the bacterial species collected by this technique are sufficiently small to be inhaled and deposited in the alveolar spaces of patients and clinicians. In a pilot study of 2 brands of commonly used dental masks, the clinician remained unprotected from aerosolized bacteria because of the mask pore size exceeded the bacterial diameter. An industrial mask was effective in preventing transmission of aerosolized bacteria. Clinicians should choose a protective mask with the most efficient PFE and BFE rating and the best facial adaptation possible. Further mask efficacy study is ongoing.",
