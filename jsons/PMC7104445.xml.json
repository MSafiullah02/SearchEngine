            "text": "I have chosen 1929 as the start date for this presentation on the history of surfactant administration in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In 1929 Kurt von Neergaard, a German-born physiologist working in Switzerland, evacuated air from an isolated porcine lung which he then filled with an isotonic gum solution \u2018to eliminate surface tension of the air tissue interfaces.\u20191 Von Neergaard then performed pressure-volume curves during expansion of the lungs with air and liquid. From these experiments he was able to conclude three things: \u2018Surface tension is responsible for the greater part of total lung recoil compared to tissue elasticity.\u2019\u2018A lower surface tension would be useful for the respiratory mechanism because without it pulmonary retraction might become so great as to interfere with adequate expansion\u2019 and\u2018Surface tension as a force counteracting the first breath of the newly born should be investigated further.\u2019 Unfortunately, von Neergaard did not follow his own advice so it was left to Peter Gruenwald, a pathologist in New York, to repeat these experiments with the lungs of stillborn infants some 18 years later.2 In 1947 Gruenwald stated \u2018the resistance to aeration is due to surface tension which counteracts the entrance of air\u2019 and he also showed that surface active substances reduced the pressure needed for lung aeration. It is perhaps noteworthy that Peter Gruenwald later taught Mary Ellen Avery.",

            "text": "In the 1950s Richard Pattle (Figure 1) was working with nerve gases in England when he made an unexpected discovery. Pattle was a physicist working at a Ministry of Defence laboratory at Porton Down when he noticed that nerve gases caused pulmonary edema foam in the rabbits he was studying. These bubbles remained stable for many hours. The usual antifoaming agents were ineffective and Pattle surmised that \u2018the air bubbles must be covered with a unique substance from the lining layers of the alveoli which made them so stable.\u20193 He also speculated that \u2018absence of the lining substance may sometimes be one of the difficulties with which a premature baby has to contend.\u2019 At almost the same time John Clements (Figure 2) working at the US Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland was performing quantitative studies using a modified Wilhelmy balance.4 Clements was a physiologist with no particular interest in the respiratory system until he was assigned the task of finding out how nerve gases damaged the lungs. In 1957, he published an article reporting the surface tension of films from the lungs of rats, cats and dogs.5 Together with Chris Macklin, a pathologist working with phosgene in Canadian chemical warfare laboratories in 19546, 7 it is remarkable how they and Pattle came to the same conclusions independently and within a few months of each other. Clearly some good came from studies in three countries of the adverse effects of nerve gases on the lungs.",

In the late 1950s Mary Ellen Avery (Figure 1) was a research fellow in Jere Mead's laboratory in Boston with Clement Smith as her clinical supervisor. Mel Avery was so impressed with Clements\u2019 1957 article that she visited him in Edgewood to learn more about the surface film balance and adapt it to study extracts from the lungs of infants who had died soon after birth. In 1959, along with Jere Mead, she published a seminal article demonstrating that HMD, later known as RDS, was due to lack of surfactant.8 The lungs of babies dying of HMD had a mean surface tension of about 30 dynes cm\u22121 compared to about 8 dynes cm\u22121 for those who died of other causes. Avery and Mead concluded \u2018hyaline membrane disease is associated with the absence or the late appearance of some substances which in the normal subject renders the internal surface capable of attaining a low surface tension when the lung volume is decreased.\u2019 Despite knowledge of the cause of RDS as early as 1959, progress in developing a cure was proceeding slowly until a significant event took place.",

An obituary in the New York Times noted that at that time all that could be done \u2018for a victim of hyaline membrane disease is to monitor the infant's blood chemistry and to try to keep it near normal levels. Thus, the battle for the Kennedy baby was lost only because medical science has not yet advanced far enough to accomplish as quickly as necessary what the body could do by itself in its own time.\u2019 Patrick Kennedy's death from HMD increased public awareness of the disease and stimulated further research into its treatment.

Beractant has added DPPC, tripalmitin and palmitic acid, whereas poractant alfa contains only polar lipids and is more concentrated than the other surfactants. There have been a number of comparative natural surfactant trials (Table 2). Five trials compared poractant alfa and beractant with Ramanathan et al.27 reporting results of two different doses of poractant alfa (200 mg per kg and 100 mg per kg), Bloom et al.28, 29 reported three studies comparing calfactant and beractant, and in Europe there have been at least two studies comparing bovactant and beractant.30, 31 The studies comparing poractant alfa and beractant were all of rescue treatment and used initial doses of either 200 mg per kg or 100 mg per kg in the poractant alfa arm compared to 100 mg per kg in the beractant arms. (Table 3) In the study by Ramanathan et al.27 both doses of poractant alfa (100 mg per kg and 200 mg per kg) were compared with one dose of beractant (100 mg per kg) and neonatal mortality was lowest in the higher dose poractant alfa group (3%) versus lower dose poractant alfa (6%) and beractant (8%). Similar reductions in mortality have been found in other trials that used a 200 mg per kg initial dose.32, 33 (Table 3) If the Ramanathan et al. study is taken to report two separate trials, beractant versus two groups of poractant alfa-treated infants, then six comparative trials of these two natural surfactants can be considered with a total of 20 deaths in the poractant alfa group and 33 in the beractant group. (Table 3) A meta-analysis of these six comparisons using neonatal mortality as an outcome shows a reduction favoring poractant alfa (RR 0.57; 0.34 to 0.96) with NNT 20 (11 to 1000).18 (Table 4) When the three comparisons using an initial dose of poractant alfa of 200 mg per kg are examined the RR is reduced to 0.29 (0.10 to 0.79) with NNT of 14 (8 to 50). However, when the 100 mg per kg doses of each surfactant are compared the reduction in neonatal mortality is no longer significant. (Table 4).",

A recent study by Bhatia and colleagues assessed outcomes of surfactant-treated babies in the United States using the Premier's Perspective Clinical Database.34 The three surfactants compared were poractant alfa, beractant and calfactant and the database of RDS-treated infants totalled just under 25 000 (Table 5). For this cohort, the unadjusted mortality rates were 6.25, 8.15 and 8.31%, respectively. After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, race, gender and transfer status odds ratios (ORs) for mortality of 1.28 for beractant and 1.47 for calfactant were obtained compared to poractant alfa. When a subset of over 10 000 infants with no missing data was evaluated the adjusted ORs for mortality increased to 1.52 for beractant and 1.60 for calfactant compared to poractant alfa. (Table 5) Also, these authors showed using the same database that lengths of hospital stay were reduced with poractant alfa compared to beractant and calfactant consistent with significant cost savings when the porcine surfactant is used to treat RDS.34",

The primary outcome for both studies was survival to 36 weeks\u2019 corrected age without need for supplemental oxygen. The sample size estimates for both studies were about 2000 and an interim analysis was planned after 1000 babies had been enrolled in the treatment trial.29 The reduction in inspired oxygen concentration was significantly faster for the calfactant-treated group compared to beractant during the first 24 h after treatment. Unfortunately, both trials were halted after 32 months because of poor enrollment. The primary outcome data were almost identical for both groups in both studies: 52% in both groups for prophylaxis and 57 and 59%, respectively, for calfactant and beractant in the treatment trial. The conclusions of the authors were clear and unambiguous: \u2018because of inadequate sample sizes, early trial closures prevent us from either accepting or rejecting our null hypotheses because of substantial risks of type-2 errors.

The inclusion criteria were birth weight between 600 and 1250 g, successful intubation soon after birth and informed parental consent. The major primary outcome was RDS-related mortality through 14 days, which is an unusual endpoint for neonatal trials. The results for beractant and colfosceril palmitate were similar and significantly higher than for lucinactant (nearly 10% versus about 5%).35 However, there were no significant differences among the three groups for mortality at 28 days, corrected age 36 weeks or survival to discharge; all more established endpoints for neonatal clinical trials.",

            "text": "The second study compared lucinactant with poractant alfa and it was conducted largely in Europe with many babies recruited in Poland.36 The entry criteria were as follows: estimated gestational age 24 to 28 weeks, rupture of the membranes for less than 2 weeks, birth weight between 600 and 1250 g, successful intubation at birth and signed informed parental consent. Randomization was after birth to either lucinactant or poractant alfa treatment and babies were stratified by both birth weight (600 to 1000 and 1001 to 1250 g) and center. The surfactants were given within 30 min of birth so it was not conventional prophylaxis (within 10 to 15 min of birth) but it was in the delivery suite. The initial dose of each surfactant was 175 mg per kg, and this is also unusual, as poractant alfa has only been administered in doses of either 100 or 200 mg per kg in previous studies.27, 32, 33, 37, 38 The volumes of surfactant needed to deliver the doses of 175 mg per kg were 5.8 and 2.2 ml kg\u22121, respectively, for lucinactant and poractant alfa.36 In addition, lucinactant is a gel that needs to be warmed to 44 \u00b0C for 15 min in a water bath and later shaken to form a liquid before it can be instilled into the lungs. This would explain why it was not possible to administer this surfactant within 10 to 15 min of birth in these studies.35, 36",

The primary outcome was survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days and to estimate a sample size a 20-year-old trial of treatment of severe RDS in babies using poractant alfa39 was used. This older trial had a 50% mortality rate in the control arm and was probably an inappropriate comparator for this so-called prophylaxis study.36 As a result the estimated sample size was only 496, much less than the 2000 estimated for the beractant versus calfactant trials.29 The trial was designed to run for 12 months but had to be extended to 24 months because of slow recruitment. It was finally stopped early when less than half the estimated sample size had been attained; the results from 243 babies were presented in the article.36 The reasons given for terminating the study were slow recruitment and lack of financial support in that resources were to be diverted to the South American trial.35 For the primary outcome of survival without BPD at 28 days the figures were 37.8% in the lucinactant group and 33.1% in the poractant alfa group but at 36 weeks\u2019 corrected age the results were in the opposite direction with figures of 64.7% for lucinactant and 66.9% for poractant alfa. Nevertheless none of these differences was statistically significant.36 The readers must decide if this study truly demonstrated equivalence or non-superiority of these two surfactant preparations as stated by the authors36 or represented a substantial risk of a type-2 error as stated in the comparative trials of beractant and calfactant.29",

It contains 50 mg phospholipids per ml and is a liquid suspension.40 rSP-C surfactant has been studied in adults with ARDS43 but not in neonatal RDS. Another surfactant containing SP-C33 is currently being studied in Stockholm but no clinical trials have yet been reported.40 This synthetic surfactant contains 2% SP-C33, DPPC/POPG in a 7:3 ratio but no palmitic acid. It is a liquid suspension and can be concentrated to 80 mg phospholipids per ml.40 In summary, it is possible to prepare physiologically active surfactants from mixtures of phospholipids and peptides but PEEP seems necessary for adequate alveolar stability in animal models of RDS and finally synthetic surfactant is probably not yet ready for the market.40, 44",

Colfosceril palmitate, one of the first synthetic surfactants approved for use, has been administered by both rapid instillation45 and slow instillation through a side port adapter attached to the endotracheal tube.46 However, clinical experience and the results of animal studies show that rapid instillation is more effective than slow instillation, at least for natural surfactants. Valls-i-Soler and colleagues showed that use of a dual lumen tube rather than disconnection from the ventilator led to fewer dosing problems.47 To date, it has not been possible to demonstrate that surfactant can be successfully administered by nebulization,48 although this remains an attractive route as it avoids intubation of the trachea. Four methods of administration that aim to reduce the duration of endotracheal intubation or avoid it altogether have been described.49, 50, 51, 52 The INSURE method involves a short intubation to administer surfactant followed by extubation to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).49 Pharyngeal deposition of surfactant soon after birth has been reported by Kattwinkel and colleagues,50 and in Italy Trevisanuto et al.51 used a laryngeal mask to deliver surfactant, both with some success although the results of randomized trials are awaited. At a recent meeting in Ancona, Herting et al. presented a poster on surfactant administration in spontaneously breathing infants using a fine gastric tube. However, intubation for rapid instillation is still the method of choice for administration of surfactant. Early extubation to CPAP seems to be a plausible ideal but has not been adequately tested in clinical trials to date.",

Infants with meconium aspiration syndrome show some response to surfactant treatment but larger and more frequent doses are needed for these effects52 and thus far no studies show improved survival. Similarly, infants with congenital pneumonia, especially those due to group B streptococcal infection, improve with surfactant treatment; however, the response is less marked than in infants with RDS.53 Whether surfactant really alters the course of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or not is still a question,54 but infants with respiratory failure on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be decannulated earlier if treated with a natural surfactant.55 To date, there have only been reports of relatively small case series of infants with acute respiratory distress syndrome RDS (ARDS),56 early chronic lung disease (CLD)57 and pulmonary hemorrhage58 treated with surfactant. Some acute improvement in oxygenation usually occurs, but long-term benefits have not been reported to date. Recently Yeh et al.59 from Taiwan reported, in a RCT of infants with RDS, delivery of budesonide to the lung by instilling it with beractant. They were able to demonstrate some acute responses and CLD was reduced in the steroid-treated group but further larger studies are needed before this becomes an accepted indication for surfactant treatment.",

A meta-analysis of these prophylaxis versus rescue treatment trials was published by Egberts et al.60 in 1997. Prophylaxis was defined as administration of surfactant in the delivery suite within 10 to 15 min of birth. Rescue treatment was generally undertaken when intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was needed with more than 40 to 50% oxygen. Prenatal steroid use was only about 20% and there were significant advantages for prophylaxis (Table 6). The adjusted ORs demonstrate an approximate halving the odds of developing severe RDS, neonatal mortality and BPD in 28-day survivors favoring prophylaxis. In 2002 Walti and colleagues using the same database of three trials demonstrated significant reductions in intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the prophylaxis group.61 (Table 6) The OR for all grades of IVH was 0.65 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.90) and for severe IVH this was 0.56 (0.35 to 0.89). For the subgroup of outborn infants the reduction in severe IVH was even more impressive (OR 0.11; 0.02 to 0.49).",

Current evidence favors the use of natural surfactants rather than the old protein-free synthetic surfactants, and it is too soon to say whether the new synthetic surfactants have a role to play and none is currently approved for treatment of the newborn.40, 62 In regard to timing, the evidence favors prophylaxis for infants of less than 31 weeks\u2019 gestation and early treatment for others who develop signs of RDS. The dose of surfactant needed may depend upon timing, severity of illness and whether or not prenatal steroids were given. A recent study from the Vermont-Oxford Neonatal Network highlighted the advantages of early or prophylactic surfactant treatment for infants of 23 to 29 weeks\u2019 gestation.63 This was a cluster randomized trial involving 114 neonatal intensive care units assessing the utility of a multifaceted intervention in promoting good practice as regards surfactant treatment. Neonatal units in the intervention group gave surfactant at a mean of 21 min after birth compared to 78 min in the control hospitals.

This study compared outcomes of extremely low gestational age (23 weeks to 27 weeks) neonates between 1994 and 2004 at the Regional Neonatal Unit, Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast. Surfactant use increased from 44 to 90% and the first dose was given much earlier (median 9 versus 180 min) in the second era. This was associated with an improved survival rate from 67 to 80% but indicators of CLD were also increased\u2014oxygen at 28 days (49 to 66%) and oxygen at corrected age 36 weeks (14 to 31%). At the same time dexamethasone use decreased from 21 to 1%. This may have accounted for some of the need for increased oxygen supplementation. Any true increase in CLD is likely to have been of the milder variety as length of stay in hospital remained similar in the two eras (median 47 versus 44 days) (Table 7). However, with improved early neonatal care and increased survival neonatologists have to care for more babies with CLD and, therefore, this remains one of the biggest problems to be solved in neonatal practice.",
