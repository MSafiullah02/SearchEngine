Cremer, the pioneer doing research on chemical sensors, discovered the phenomenon that glass thin films respond to hydrogen ions in a solution and invented the glass electrode for measuring pH. This allowed for the development of chemical sensors. With continuous ongoing studies, glass-based thin-film pH sensors entered the practical stage in 1930. However, the research on chemical sensors progressed slowly before the 1960s during which only a study on humidity sensors employing lithium chloride was reported in 1938.",

It establishes the preference with which the sensor responds to the analyte in the presence of various interfering ions (Koryta, 1986) . Fig. 4 .4 illustrates the typical measurement schematic of an ISE. As shown in the right part of the figure, the ion-selective membrane of the ISE is between the sample solution with the ionic activity \u03b1 x and the internal reference solution with the different ionic activity \u03b1 0 (\u03b1 0 is a constant). The ion-exchange and mass diffusion occurs on the membrane interface. Supposing the membrane is only permeable to the sample ion, the potential difference E ISE across the membrane can be described by the Nernst equation: where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, Z is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, K is a constant to account for all other interfacial potentials, and S=59.16/Z (mV) at 298 K.

Other ions that can be measured include fluoride, bromide, cadmium and gases in solutions such as ammonia, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. As shown in Fig. 4 .6, a typical commercial electrode is made of a glass tube ended with small glass bubble. Inside the electrode is usually filled with a buffered solution of chlorides (for pH probe is usually 0.1 mol/L HCl) in which silver wire covered with silver chloride is immersed. The active part of the electrode is the glass bubble with a typical wall thickness of 0.05 -0.2 mm. When the glass membrane is exposed to the solution, a thick hydrated layer is formed (5 -100 nm), which exhibits improved mobility of the ions. Besides, the glass electrodes can also be applied to the detection of sodium, potassium and ammonium ions. This depends mainly on the component of the glass materials.

Recently, publications paid more attention on the monitoring of cell metabolism in which electrophysiological signals are not measured but are physiological. It mainly focused on the extracellular acidification rate of a cell culture. The pH in the cellular microenvironment (pH M ) is an important regulator of cell-to-cell and cell-to-host interactions. This is, for example, of particular importance in the field of tumor biology and in intercellular signaling. The pH M is reduced significantly in the interstitium of solid tumors in comparison to the values of normal interstitial fluid. Additionally, the extracellular acidification rate of a cell culture is an important indicator of global cellular metabolism (Lehmann et al., 2000) . Lehmann et al. (2000) developed a method measuring the pH M on line and in real time in the immediate vicinity (10 -100 nm) of the cell plasma membranes. As shown in Fig. 4 .11, in a flow through chamber, adherent tumor cells (LS174T) were cultured on specially developed pH-ISFET arrays to elucidate how the pH of cell-covered ISFETs differs from the pH of ISFETs in cell-free regions. The pH-sensitivity of the Al 2 O 3 -ISFETs is 56.119\u00b12.12 mV/pH. The output signal of the ISFETs as the measure for the pH value is given by the source voltage V GS relative to the reference potential. The perfusion rate of the cell culture medium was increasing between 1.3 and 4.3 mL/h in a stop and flow mode, and the effect of Triton X-100 on the pH of the cells was studied then. Fig. 4.11 .

The semiconductor will always be a p-type or n-type doped silicon wafer (e.g., 1 -10 \u2126 cm, 350 -400 \u03bcm, <100>), and the insulating layer may be a 30 -50 nm thick oxide layer, e.g., SiO 2 , produced by dry oxidation, or Si 3 N 4 . The insulator depends on the later application, since it provides the sensitivity towards a specific substance. For pH sensing, Si 3 N 4 and Ta 2 O 5 are known as stable and sensitive transducer materials for LAPS. Besides, there is an ohmic contact (e.g., 300 nm) in the rear-side. The characteristics of LAPS are investigated by means of current-voltage (I-V) measurements. When a DC bias potential is applied to the silicon plate, the phase and the magnitude of the potential are adjusted so that the major charge carriers near the insulator/semiconductor interface are depleted by the electrical field effect. The width, and therefore, the capacitance of the depletion layer will vary with the potential at the solid/electrolyte interface, which is a function of the local value of the surface potential. The local value of the depletion capacitance can be read out with AC photocurrent that is generated when an intensity-modulated light source is shown at the bulk silicon surface (Ismail et al., 2001) . The resultant AC photocurrent is then amplified with a preamplifier and converted into a DC voltage signal, which is acquired by the computer via an A/D converter. By measuring the photocurrent, which is dependent on the capacitance of the depletion layer, the variation in the phase boundary potential can be determined. Since the value of the potential difference at the phase boundary of solid/electrolyte depends on the concentration of the corresponding ions in the solution, the voltage shift in the current-voltage characteristics of the LAPS can be applied to measure the ion concentration in the solution (Mourzina et al., 2003) .",

(2001) described a novel chalcogenide glass ion-sensitive membrane LAPS device for the detection of Pb 2+ . In this study, the Pb-Ag-As-I-S chalcogenide glass is deposited on the LAPS structure by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique as a Pb-ion-selective transducer material for the first time. Fig. 4 .15 shows the scheme of pulsed laser deposition technique. The main potential-determining process, which takes place at the interface between the chalcogenide glass membrane and the solution, is the exchange of primary ions between the solution and the exchange sites at the modified surface layer of the glass. Fig. 4 .16 shows the dependence of the AC photocurrent I, measured in the external circuit on the applied bias potential V, for different concentrations of Pb 2+ -ions in the solution. The current-voltage curve moves reproducibly along the voltage axis depending on the Pb 2+ -ion concentrations. ",

In Fig. 4 .19b, a Pt foil as the counter electrode (CE) and an Ag/AgCl foil as the reference electrode (RE) were attached on the other side of printed circuit board and also encapsulated using epoxy resin. After mercury deposition was carried out on the Au, the MEA was ready to detect heavy metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II) and Cu(II). Then the analytical performance of mercury-coated gold MEA was studied using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) for determination of Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II) and Cu(II) in the acetate buffer with pH 4.5 (Fig. 4.20) .

The schematic diagram of the sensor is shown in Fig. 4 .22, Pt working electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode are fabricated on the top layer with electron beam deposition (electrode thickness: 100 nm). The electrode is a simple stripe design that the width of the Pt electrode is 10 mm and that of the Ag/AgCl electrode is 5 mm. The sensor is fabricated by stacking the electrodes, gas-permeable membrane and solution-permeable filter together. The chemical reactions are the following: The sensor was subject to pure Ar, 10% and 30% O 2 and the responses are shown in Fig. 4 .23, the output current was significantly reduced by 30 \u00b5A, when 10% O 2 gas (10% O 2 and 90% Ar) was flown into the air-filled chamber. The response time to reach a steady current level was approximately 40 s. The current began to recover right after the gas flow was stopped, as air started to flow in the chamber. The recovery time to return to the original level of current was almost four times higher than the decay response time, which, however, can be reduced by flowing fresh air into the chamber at a high flow rate. As shown in Fig. 4 .23a, the sensor output shows repeatable current response in the presence of 10% O 2 , and the current was reduced by about 30 \u00b5A for each cycle. In contrast to the 10% O 2 , exposure to 30% O 2 made the output current changes in the reverse direction, and increase sharply by about 25 \u00b5A. This is because the oxygen current content in the sensor ambient was increased by 20% compared to the baseline value. The response time for the current to reach a steady value in this case was also about 40 s, similar to decay response time observed for 10% O 2 . However, the recovery time observed was even longer than the first case. To determine the sensor performance over a large range of oxygen concentration, it was further exposed to 60% and 90% O 2 . We observed that the change in output current is +60 \u00b5A for 60% O 2 gas, and +75 \u00b5A for 90% O 2 . Fig. 4 .23b shows the change in output current as the sensor is exposed to different oxygen composition from the baseline air environment. We observe that the output current changes much faster with change in oxygen composition for lower oxygen concentration, but gradually tends to saturate for higher oxygen concentration. This is possible because the oxygen generated current starts to get affected by the diffusion-limitation of dissolved oxygen at the Pt electrode.",

The third one is about temperature during the sintering and heating process. A number of sensor-based instruments on the market can measure the concentrations of reducing gases or vapors in the air. Examples include breath-alcohols analyzers used by police departments, carbon monoxide (CO) analyzers used in performing emission control measurements on vehicles, and methane detectors used to protect against explosions and other dangers from natural gas. All these applications have three things in common: They are at relatively low cost, they are operated by ordinary people rather than scientists and engineers, and they are manufactured using similar technology. The Figaro TGS gas sensors are based on a technology that uses powdered tin dioxide (SnO 2 ) sintered onto a semiconductor substrate in Fig. 4 .24a. In normal operation the sensor element is heated to approximately 400 \u00b0C. Oxygen is adsorbed onto the surface of the SnO 2 , where the oxygen molecules accept electrons. These electrons create a relatively high electrical potential barrier that is difficult for free electrons to cross. As a result, the electrical resistance is high and is a function of the partial pressure of oxygen ( 2 O P ) which is shown in Fig. 4 .24b.",

Then the clinohedral structure turns into the polytropism structure, and follows the volume contraction and endothermic reaction, therefore it is an unstable structure. Mixing ZrO 2 with the stabilizer such as alkali soils calcium oxide CaO or rare earth yttrium oxide Y 2 O 3 , the ZrO 2 will become the stable fluorine cubic crystal. The stable degree is related to the density of stabilizer. The ZrO 2 is sintered under 1,800 \u00b0C after being mixed with stabilizer, a part of zirconium ion will be substituted by the calcium ion, producing (ZrO\u00b7CaO). Because Ca 2+ is divalent ion, Zr 4+ is quadrivalence ion, to maintain the electric neutrality, the oxygen ion O 2hole will be generated in the crystal. This is why (ZrO\u00b7CaO) transfers oxygen ions at high temperature, and (ZrO\u00b7CaO) becomes oxygen ion conductor at 300 -800 \u00b0C.

A SAW sensor with Pt coated ZnO nanorods as the selective layer has been investigated for hydrogen detection by Fu et al. (2009) .",

A dual delay line system as shown in Fig. 4 .32, which consisted of two counterparts in the oscillator (one is coated with the selective material and the other is bare to execute common mode rejection), was realized to eliminate external environmental fluctuations. To function as an active element, the coated one contributes to a frequency shift by the interaction between the sensing material and the target gas. By comparison, the reference one, which has a bare surface, gives the signal of the environmental effects. Pt coated ZnO nanorods were chosen as the selective layer due to the advantages of simple fabrication, high sensitivity to hydrogen at room temperature, and no reaction to moisture. First of all, a thin ZnO film was deposited on the SAW delay line, the as-prepared substrate was immersed into an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hydrate and methenamine at 95 \u00b0C for 5 h. Then, the substrate was rinsed with deionized water. Fig. 4 .33 is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the ZnO nanorods. Finally, a Pt film was coated over the ZnO nanorods as a catalyst by electron beam evaporation. The real-time responses of the dual-channel sensor to different H 2 concentrations are shown in Fig. 4 .34. At the initial stage, the steady state of the base frequency was reached, and then nitrogen or hydrogen was led into the PDMS chamber. Testing cycles were implemented with constant exposure time and purge time to reach a new steady state or return to the baseline. The sensor was then exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen: 200, 500, 1,500, 2,500, and 6,000 ppm at room temperature. The responses were 8. 36, 12.66, 17.47, 20, and 26 .2 kHz respectively. It took less than 15 min to reach about 90% of the steady state, and the recovery time was about 2 -3 min. The frequency shifts for different H 2 concentrations are shown in Fig. 4 .34. The results show that the Pt coated nanorod based SAW hydrogen sensor provides high sensitivity, fast response, and good repeatability while operating at room temperature. It is worth noting that the sensor can avoid the influence of humidity.",

The bridge output voltage is directly proportional to absolute humidity When current is passed through the thermistors, resistive heating increases their temperature to >200 \u00b0C. The heat dissipated from the sealed thermistor is greater than the exposed thermistor due to the difference in the thermal conductively of the water vapor as compared to dry nitrogen.

The human nose uses the lungs to bring the odor to the epithelium layer; the e-Nose has a pump. The human nose has mucous, hairs, and membranes to act as filters and concentrators, while the e-Nose has an inlet sampling system that provides sample filtration and conditioning to protect the sensors and enhance selectivity. The human epithelium contains the olfactory epithelium, which contains millions of sensing cells, selected from 100 -200 different genotypes that interact with the odorous molecules in unique ways. The e-Nose has a variety of sensors that interact differently with the sample. The human receptors convert the chemical responses to electronic nerve impulses. The unique pattern of nerve impulses is propagated by neurons through a complex network before reaching the higher brain for interpretation. Similarly, the chemical sensors in the e-Nose react with the sample and produce electrical signals. A computer reads the unique pattern of signals, and interprets them with some forms of intelligent pattern classification algorithm. From these similarities we can easily understand the nomenclature (Stetter and Penrose, 2001) . Although e-Noses are systems that, just like the human nose, try to characterize different gas mixtures, there are still fundamental differences in both the instrumentation and software. The Bio-nose can perform tasks still out of reach for the e-Nose, but the reverse is also true. Accordingly, an e-Nose is composed of two main components: the sensing system and the pattern recognition system, capable of recognizing simple or complex odors. And an individual sensor used for the detection of a particular substance, e.g., CO-sensor, is thus not e-Nose.",

The respiratory gas is enriched by an adsorption tube, desorption happens in the inlet of the capillary at a high temperature, then the VOCs is carried into the capillary to be separated by the carry gas. When the VOCs come out from the capillary, there will be a frequency change because the VOCs can attach to the surface of the SAW sensor independently by reason of condensation, then the PCA and image analysis are used for pattern recognition after the signal is obtained and processed. One detect result of the mixed VOCs sample by the e-Nose system is shown in Fig. 4 .48. As seen from the figure, the VOCs can be easily detected by the e-Nose system. This e-Nose, which is based on the gas chromatography technology, causes its responses to have two components: the appearance time and the response intensity. We may know from the capillary separation technique that the peak time represents the time of each component used to pass through the capillary, as a result of the difference of physical and chemistry characteristics, different components use difference time to pass through the capillary, so the appearance time of the peak can be used for determining material. Because the capillary separating technique is applied, some disturbance factor in the environment is separated in the peak time; there will be no influence on the substance we need to detect, regardless of whether its density is high or low compared to the environmental disturbance. So the SAW gas sensor combined with the capillary separation technique can simulate a virtual sensor array containing hundreds of orthogonal (non-overlapping) sensors, which can detect and distinguish hundreds of different kinds of gases.",

A classification is often combined with a dimension reduction in variable space. A multi-sensor system produces data of high dimensionality, i.e. a large number of variables characterizing each observation. It is difficult to visualize more than three dimensions simultaneously. Hence, methods to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data sets are important. The variable space is an essential concept in order to grasp the ideas behind many data processing techniques. In the variable space, variables are seen as orthogonal basis vectors. An observation corresponds to a point in the sensor space, and a whole data set can be seen as a point swarm in this space. A way to reduce the dimensionality is to find new directions in the variable space and use only the most influential directions as new variables. A basis change is made and a dimensionality reduction is performed. In a principal component analysis, a transformation (projection) in the variable space is made (Fig. 4.51) . Directions are found explaining as much of the variance in a data set as possible. These new directions, called principal components, are then used as the new variables. Keeping only principal components with high variation, leads to a dimension reduction. There are other methods to reduce the dimensionality in a variable space. All these methods are performed by finding new directions optimizing a specific criterion, and only the most influential directions are kept for the following visualization and classification. (c) The low-dimensional projection of the data can be used as a simple but good approximation of the data set",

The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in unison to solve specific problems (Fig. 4.52) . ANNs, like people, learn by example. An ANN is configured for an application such as identifying chemical vapours through a learning process. Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurons. This is true of ANNs as well. For the electronic nose, the ANN learns to identify the various chemicals or odors by examples. The basic unit of an artificial neural network is the neuron. Each neuron of the input layer receives a number of inputs, multiplies the inputs by individual weights, sums the weighted inputs, and passes the sum through a transfer function, which can be, e.g., linear or sigmoid (linear for values close to zero, flattening out for large positive or negative values). An ANN is an interconnected network of neurons. The input layer has one neuron for each of the sensor signals, while the output layer has one neuron for each of the different sample properties that should be predicted. Usually, one hidden layer with a variable number of neurons is placed between the input and output layer. During the ANN training phase, the weights and transfer function parameters in the ANN are adjusted such that the calculated output values for a set of input values are as close as possible to the known true values of the sample properties. The model estimation is more complex than that for a linear regression model due to the non-linearity of the model. The model adaptation is made using the specific algorithm like back-propagation algorithm involving gradient search methods, where each weight is changed in proportion to the error which is caused.",

The taste buds respond to different chemicals in the solution to generate signals which are transferred through the nerves to the brain. Then the brain does the analysis and processing to obtain the overall features of the signals and gives the distinction between different chemicals as well as the sensory information. The initial design idea of e-Tongue originates from the biological mechanism of taste recognition (Fig. 4.54) . Just like the tongue of organisms, the sensor array of e-Tongue responds to different chemical substances and collects a variety of signals to be transferred to the computer. Instead of the brain of the organism, the computer distinguishes the different signals, makes identification and finally gives sensory information of the various substances.

The bionic taste chip was able to do the parallel, real-time and quantifiable measurement of a variety of constituents in the same solution. Synthetic microspheres whose diameters in the range of 50 -100 \u03bcm were fixed in micro grooves etched in the silicon wafer surface (Fig. 4.58) . The chip and CCD were separately fixed on top of and under the platform. Modulated lights emitted by the blue light-emitting diodes went through the ball and the bottom of the platform and were absorbed by the CCD detector. The taste chip could preliminary determine the concentrations of H + , Ca 2 + , Ce 3 + and sugar in the solution. Based on the above work, the researchers developed algorithms of signal recognition to achieve the multi-ion identification automatically. Fig. 4 .59a shows the detection system of the bionic taste chip. The analyte was pumped into the reaction chamber and reacted with the sensitive materials adsorbed on the surfaces of microspheres whose colors changed in the reaction. Images of the microspheres were recorded by CCD through the microscope. RGB values were extracted from specified areas on the microspheres as the output of the taste chip. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to process the data to achieve the qualitative and quantitative measurement of the constituents of the analyte. Fig. 4 .59b shows the PCA results which successfully distinguished the six kinds of metal ions in the same solution. ",

When dealing with flow in configurations of microns or less, some special effects and unexpected phenomena can be observed.

This approach has been successfully applied to the modeling of some microfluidic components such as valves, and channels. In more complex structures or systems, numerical simulations are used. The most common method of numerical simulation is based on a subdivision of the complete structure into lumped elements, which can be described individually by simple analytical models, and for which simple relations between individual lumped elements can be formulated (Gravesen et al., 1993) . These models and relations of interaction can then be fed into a dedicated or generally available computer program. In this way, micropumps, valves, flow sensors, and flow dispenser have been simulated using dedicated computer programs. In order to apply the approaches mentioned before to fluid mechanic modeling successfully by the direct utilization of analytical models or lumped element models, it is necessary to make correct assumptions as to types of flow. In micro flows, the Reynolds number is typically very small and shows the ratio between the viscous force and the inertial force. It is a common and practical method to determine whether a given flow pattern is laminar or tubular by evaluating the Reynolds number.",

The research on the techniques for chip surface modification is composed of a large percent of the research on the microfluidics. When the analysis system works, micro flow operation that depends on the inner surface properties of microchannels is usually worked in a passive mode. In the microfluidic chips that use electro osmotic flow driving, it is the most common used technique due to its simple operation, without requirements on extra devices, and without increase in the chip system volume. The basic principle of this technique is to determine the velocity and direction of the electro osmotic flow by changing the density and polarity of charges located in the inner surface of micro channels. As shown in Fig. 4 .60, by the method of coating an electrolyte layer of polymer on the inner surface of micro channels, the direction of the micro flow can be changed and complex flow operations can be achieved (Barker et al., 2000) . Furthermore, simultaneous flow in opposite directions can be achieved in a single micro channel. Another predominant application of this technique is to obtain the flow limitation. For example, hydrophobic glass micro channels can be achieved by the method of immobilizing a self-assemble monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane on the inner surface of micro channels. In the polymer micro channel, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic region can be achieved by depositing a layer of poly phenylene-2-methyl and silicon oxidize on the inner surface of micro channel.",

Its basic principle is using the fixed charges on the inner surface of micro channels to drive the micro flow. Its advantages include lack of mechanical components, simple configuration, convenient operation, flat flow, and no pulsation. However, this method is sensitive to the influences of external electrical fields, channel surface, properties of micro flow, and the effect of heat transfer. So, it is not so stable and can only be applied to electrolyte solutions. Electroosmosis can not only be used to directly drive the charged flow, but also can be used as the energy source of the micro pump, which is called the electro osmotic pump. The method to achieve this kind of electro osmotic pump is as follows: electrodes with certain intervals are fabricated on the surface of a chip basis by using lithography. Then it is sealed with PDMS micro channels to form a hermetic electro osmotic driving system. When it works, the voltage is applied to the electrodes to generate an electro osmotic flow. As the electro osmotic flow only exists between the two electrodes, the flow outside the two electrodes can be driven by the electro osmotic flow. Consequently, the function of the electro osmotic pump can be realized as shown by Fig. 4.61 .",

When there is no pressure applied, the restitution of the PDMS thin film can be achieved by its own elastic force, thus the channel becomes unobstructed and the valve sits open. By the sequential control of the opening and closing of three valves, the driving of micro flow can be obtained. Micro flow control is the central principle of microfluidic chip operations. It is related to almost all the processes such as sampling, mixing, reaction, and separation, which are necessary to be finished in the controllable flow. Valve is the central component for flow control both in macro and micro scale. Due to its importance, micro valve has been deeply studied before the invention of the microfluidic chip. In the primary stage of its development, microfluidic chips are normally a kind of capillary electrophoresis on a chip, which is dependent on the electro osmotic driving.

Electroosmosis is a type of phenomenon that the solution in the micro channel can move in the desired direction along the inner surface of the channel under the effect of the electrical field. It has been widely used in micro flow control. Compared to other types of micro pumps, the most important feature of electro osmotic valves is their simple and flexible operation. The velocity and direction of flow can be controlled by adjusting the voltage applied to different nodes of the micro channel. Consequently, operations such as complex mixing, reaction, and separation can be realized. Besides the voltage, electro osmotic micro valves can be affected by such factors as the chemical composition of channel surface, ingredients of buffer solution, and temperature.",

            "text": "There are two methods being used to solve the changing sample problem. One is the once-off sample introduction, such as the utilization of disposable chips, multi sample chambers on a single chip, multi analysis units on a single chip, and multi sample introduction before measurement. Another method is to use recyclable chips to realize continuous changing of the samples either manually or automatically. Generally, the sample source tends to provide continuous sample flow. In order to get output from the sample zone, some auxiliary methods are necessary. A commonly used method is to set an auxiliary channel on the chip, which is perpendicular to the sample processing channel. The sample zone can be generated in the cross of the two channels. This method is called the single channel aid sample introduction. It is the most studied and most representative sample zone introduction method. It includes two steps, loading and sampling. Loading refers to the process of sample load to the auxiliary channel through a storage chamber and is filled within the cross of channels. Sampling is the process of introducing the sample that is located in the cross to the sample processing channel by electrical forces or pressure. Fig. 4 .65 shows the principle of the simple sample introduction method by electrical forces. Sample for microfluidic analysis systems are usually related to the biological sample containing complex composition. So, the techniques for sample pretreatment are very important, which often include sample pre-separation and pre-concentration. Pre-separation includes liquid-liquid extraction, solid phase extraction, filtration, chromatography, and membrane separation. Pre-concentration includes iso-electric focusing, isotachophoresis, and field amplified stacking. Furthermore, multi phase laminar flow techniques and various micro filters (Fig. 4.66) can be used to sample pretreatment. ",

It was a typical environmental hazard caused by chemical pollution and biological turbulence. To clarify the pollution status, a WSN monitor project has been carrying out since 2008. Sensor node and wireless network construction are two essential components of WSN. Fig. 4 .74 shows the structure of a WSN node, which will be deployed in the Taihu Lake project, focusing on chemical pollution monitoring. A WSN node is composed of sensitive device, processor unit, wireless communication module and power supply unit. The sensitive device detects the specialized information of a certain object. The processor unit receives the signal from the sensitive device, amplifies it if necessary, then converts it into digital data and sends it to the next process. The processor unit also controls the total sensor node as a commander. The wireless communication module answers the communications with the other nodes, sending/receiving data and exchanging information. The power supply unit provides energy to all the parts above. Usually a micro battery or solar energy solution is an advisable choice. Furthermore, Fig. 4 .75 shows the complex MEMS sensitive device of the WSN node in the Taihu Lake project. Up to 4 MEA (microelectrode array) and 4 LAPS (Light addressable potentiometer sensor), which all act as chemical sensors, are integrated on the complex chip. Based on different sensitive theories of MEA and LAPS, self-compensation and multi-parameter measurement are standout advantages of the complex device. Fig. 4 .76 shows the pre-amplifier unit. Ultra low noise amplifier receives the weak signal from complex device and sends it to next stage after amplifying. The detect limit can be as low as 0.5 nA. ",

Since wireless communication often dominates the energy dissipation in a WSN, several promising approaches have been proposed to achieve power-efficient multi-hop communication in ad hoc networks. Topology control aims to reduce the transmission power by adjusting nodal radio transmission ranges while preserving necessary network properties. Power-aware routing protocols choose appropriate transmission ranges and routes to conserve energy used for multi-hop packet transmission. Both topology control and power-aware routing focus on reducing the power consumption when the radio interface is actively transmitting and receiving packets (Sichitiu, 2004) .",

Specifically, the sensor location estimation problem is explored for sensors that measure range via received signal strength (RSS) or time-of-arrival (TOA) between themselves and neighboring sensors. TOA ranging has been implemented using two-way or round-trip time-of-arrival measurements. Inquiry-response protocols and careful calibration procedures are presented to allow devices to measure the total delay between an original inquiry and the returned response. Ranging is also possible using RSS measurement, which can be measured from reception of any transmission in the network. In a frequency hopping radio, RSS measurements can be averaged over frequency to reduce frequency-selective fading error. RSS is attractive from the point of view of device complexity, but is traditionally seen as a coarse measure of ranges. Sensor location estimation with about 1 m RMS error has been tested using both TOA and RSS measurements (Meguerdichian et al., 2001) . Fig. 4 .78 shows a multi-function sensor/sink WSN node, which is the basic unit of the Taihu Lake project, combined with key techniques mentioned above. With the special low power consumption MCU and related extern circuits. Average work current is lower than 20 mA, and idle mode current is as low as 100 \u03bcA. Moreover, the relative location estimation program has been planted into the MCU as part of the firmware. At the same time, the network security issue is checked from both the hardware and software view. Using CPLD and FPGA programmed devices, the hardware of the circuit is difficult to be copied. And security arithmetic is integrated in the application software. Further research is even in progress, focusing on simplifying the hardware circuit. The finial version node may include only 2 ICs (integrate chips): one is the MCU, including power management and interface module, the other is a complex analog chip, including all analog amplifiers, signal mixers, A/D and D/A converters.
