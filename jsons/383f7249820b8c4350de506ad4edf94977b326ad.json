This virus mainly transmitted between humans through directly respiratory droplets and close contacts. However, there is currently some evidence where it has been claimed that it may be indirectly transmitted. In this work, we study the mode of transmission of COVID-19 epidemic system based on the susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model. We have calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 by next-generation matrix method. We observed that if R 0 < 1, then disease-free equilibrium point is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable but when R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point exists and is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulation is presented to validate our results.",

            "text": "Today an invisible emperor of the world has put human civilization in front of a big question mark which is popularly known as COVID-19 (World Health Organization (WHO)). Mankind, proud of being the most advanced intelligent creature in the world is now endangered by its tyranny. COVID-19 is an abbreviated form of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has not been previously identified in humans [1]. On Dec, 2019, this disease was first identified in Wuhan city Hubei province of china [25] , after that rapidly it has spread out all over the world. SARS [3] and MERS [4] , these two previously known corona virus disease outbreaks have already occurred in the last two decades. Till now it is reported that COVID-19 has been spread out in more than 200 countries and now it has taken the shape of an epidemic in worldwide with more than 3.8 million people infected and 2.5 lakhs death [5] . It is presumed that COVID-19 is directly transmitted through human to human via respiratory droplets among closed contact and infected people generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory discomfort and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection [6] . In [7] , Jiang et al. estimated that fatality rate of this virus is near about 4.5% but for the age group 70-79 it has gone up to 8%. This disease is more critical for elder people who has other diseases like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease [6] . However, these transmission modes do not explain all cases. A lot of evidences have shown that COVID-19 has highly similar biological properties with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In their study [29] , Cai et al. investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China and showed that indirect transmission of the causative virus occurred from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons. Zhang et al. [19] , suggested that transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person. Guo et al. [30] , tested surface and air samples from an intensive care unit (ICU) and a general COVID-19 ward at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China and found that contamination was greater in ICU than general wards, they also have seen that virus was widely distributed on floors, computer mice, trash cans, and sickbed handrails. Therefore, it can be concluded that the transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person. Considering direct transmission mode, already a lot of works have been done mathematically and numerically to give an efficient prediction on COVID 19 outbreaks [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] . Researchers are trying their best to discovering vaccines and treatments for the virus but it may be far away from our imagination. In this work, we have formulated a mathematical model of direct and indirect transmission to study the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks.",
