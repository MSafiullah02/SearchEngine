Viruses are intracellular pathogens with small genomes and, therefore, they have to divert some of the cellular machineries to provide an optimal environment for their own replication. Many viruses, whether they replicate or not in the nucleus of infected cells, induce modifications of nuclear substructures, including chromosomal domains, promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, Cajal bodies and nucleoli [1] . The nucleolus, which is the beststudied nuclear body, forms around the clusters of genes coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and is the site of rDNA transcription, rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. Indeed, until recently, nucleoli were considered essentially as the sites of ribosome biogenesis. However, several insights from the last decade are changing our understanding of the biology of nucleoli. Advances in proteomics and in live cell imaging have revealed that nucleoli are dynamic structures composed of more that 700 different protein species. It is becoming evident that nucleoli contain multifunctional proteins that can play many essential roles in cellular pathways, in addition to ribosome biogenesis, and that most of these proteins are in constant flux with the other cell compartments in response to various perturbations, including stress, cellular diseases and viral infections [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1561, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1569, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1577, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The nucleolar structural integrity depends on the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) activity and on the correct expression of the nucleolar protein nucleolin/C23 [8] .

Indeed, stimulated lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients show abnormal nucleolar structure and an increase in nucleolin membrane localisation [19] [20] [21] . Surface nucleolin behaves like an HIV receptor. Anchorage of HIV particles induces nucleolin aggregation, and HIV attachment to cells is almost totally prevented in cells pre-incubated either with a pseudopeptide mimicking a region of viral gp120 protein essential for receptor binding and cell attachment, or with a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of nucleolin. This indicates that surface nucleolin is implicated in virus attachment probably through interaction with gp120 [22] [23] [24] . After HIV entry, the amount of cell surface nucleolin decreases due to its translocation into the cytoplasm where the amount of nucleolin increases [22] . Cell-surface nucleolin has been identified also at the surface of human lung epithelial cells. It interacts with human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) envelope proteins, leading to efficient viral entry. HPIV-3 infection and virus internalisation are inhibited by nucleolin antibodies, indicating that cell-surface nucleolin is involved in the internalisation process.

For this, Rev has to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, to bind viral RNAs and to interact with various nuclear import and export factors. The nucleolus plays a central role in this process. B23 imports Rev into the nucleus and the nucleolus [27, 28] . A series of reports demonstrate that HIV RNA passes through the nucleolus before nuclear export [33, 34] , and that the nucleolar trafficking of Rev and of viral RNA is critical for the outcome of infection. Indeed, sequestration of Rev in the nucleolus impairs HIV-1 infection [35] , and HIV-1 infection is prevented in cells expressing a nucleolar-localised hammerhead ribozyme that specifically targets the viral RNA [34] . The efficient export of Rev-RNA complexes requires the multimerisation of Rev and the interaction of Rev with the cellular export factors CRM1, nucleoporin 98 (Nup98) and Nup214. It has been shown that Rev multimerises predominantly in nucleoli [36] , and that expression of Rev leads to nucleolar targeting of CRM1, Nup98 and Nup214 [37] [38] [39] . Therefore, it has been speculated that complexes containing Rev, CRM1, Nup98 and Nup214, could assemble in the nucleoli or in the nucleoplasm, and export Rev-RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [39] .

A recent study shows that Rex recruits CRM1 in nucleoli, and that CRM1 is present in all the subnuclear structures containing Rex and also in nuclear bodies containing the viral transactivation factor Tax. It also reveals that p30 interacts with Rex, and over expression of p30 results in the sequestration of Rex/CRM1 complexes in the nucleoli [45] . It was therefore proposed that nucleoli could be the route of entry of Rex in the nucleus and the site where Rex and CRM1 assembled complexes are sequestered by the negative regulator p30 [45] .

The relevance of Cap/Rep nucleolar targeting is developed in a following paragraph. Both viral proteins bind to nucleolin and B23 [50, 51] . In a very recent report, recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) vectors were tracked in order to determine the cellular conditions that control AAV Cap trafficking. After infection, rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus, accumulate in the nucleolus where they retain their infectivity, and remain sequestered there in a stable form [52] . Knockdown of B23 potentiates nucleolar accumulation, while knockdown of nucleolin mobilises Caps to the nucleoplasm, and viral transduction is improved in both cases [52] .
