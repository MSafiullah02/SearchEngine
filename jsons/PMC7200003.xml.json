There are no therapeutic options beyond symptomatic intensive care treatment for severely ill patients at this time. We call on European physicians and scientists to urgently evaluate the potential of antibody-based therapies in this context.",

Preliminary uncontrolled studies in China indeed indicate that infusion of convalescent plasma might benefit patients on mechanical ventilation [6]. On this basis, programs of convalescent plasma therapy (\u201cpassive immunotherapy\u201d) have been launched in several centers in the United States [7]. Passive immunotherapy has been conceptualized over 100 years ago with the pioneering works of von Behring and Roux. Europe has played a major role in the development of passive immunotherapy with plasma and ensuing hyperimmune immunoglobulins, F(ab\u2019)2 or Fab fragments of immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies. Effective neutralizing antibodies for passive immunotherapy have been generated in recent outbreaks of H5N1 [8,9], SARS [10], and Ebola [11].",

Currently available assays will allow selection of plasma donors with high titers of neutralizing antibodies for plasma therapy and the preparation of hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin.
