However, even speculating that ACE2 is overexpressed in these patients, the authors also assume that therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs can facilitate infection with COVID-19 and even increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19, because both hypertensive and diabetic patients are most often treated with those medications.",

ACE2 is indeed overexpressed in conditions associated with general or local harmful effects of AngII, such as heart failure and ischaemic heart disease.14,15 Experimental studies indicate that up-regulation of ACE2 might be a potent protective mechanisms against AngII-mediated organ damage.16 There is no evidence that, because of the ACE2 overexpression, the SARS-CoV2 infection can be facilitated. Rather, there are opposite opinions derived from other viral outbreaks.17 In Sierra Leone, Ebola infection has been empirically treated using a combination of ARBs and statins.18 Studies on influenza from the University of Virginia also suggest that these medications increase resistance to the effect of viral infections in general,17 and raise an interesting hypothesis about targeting with therapy individual resistance to infection more than reducing viral activity. Very recently, a strong hypothesis has been raised to make ACE2 a target for therapy against SARS-CoV2 infection.4",
