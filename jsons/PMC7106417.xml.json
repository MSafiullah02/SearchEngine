            "text": "Rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests for influenza virus permit timely treatment decisions and infection control measures in emergency rooms, hospital wards, and nursing homes [1], [2], [3]. The current methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza include virus isolation by cell culture, direct antigen detection (DAD), and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). Virus isolation by cell culture permits identification of infectious virus with fairly high sensitivity, but is time- and resource-consuming and largely limited to specialized laboratories. DAD has been widely used because of its short turn-around time (TAT), but is limited by its lower sensitivity, especially in adult patients and those presenting several days after symptom onset [4], [5]. NAT is characterized by high sensitivity and specificity, semi-quantification in real-time formats, and its amenability to automation and multiplexing [6]. However, NAT requires a molecular diagnostic laboratory with skilled personnel, appropriate instrumentation, but rarely delivers results with TAT of <6 h.",

By excluding these 13 samples from analysis, the sensitivity increased to 86.5% and the specificity to 100%. Possibly, tests using high-grade extraction-amplification procedures are less affected by testing frozen samples, even with lower amounts of influenza virus, than Alere\u2122 Influenza A&B. Of those 13 samples 5 resulted in discordant results with the Alere\u2122 Influenza A&B assay, with viral QNAT loads between 30 and 18,000 GEq/mL.3.Influenza-A and -B from cell culture estimated the limit of detection of around 5,000 to 50,000 GEq/mL for Alere\u2122 Influenza A&B. Therefore, patients with lower viral loads might not be identified.4.The overall low number of influenza-B in both test series limits an independent conclusion about the assay performance. Other studies report a sensitivity of Alere\u2122 Influenza A&B of 73%\u201399% for influenza-A, 97%\u2013100% for influenza-B; and specificity of 95%\u2013100% for influenza-A, and 100% for influenza-B [9], [10], [11].\n",
