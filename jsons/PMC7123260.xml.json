There has always been much confusion relating to terminology. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, and meningoencephalitis is inflammation of both the brain and meninges (Cherry, Shields, and Bronstein, in press). The term emcephalopathy refers to an illness with neurologic findings suggestive of encephalitis but without inflammation of the brain. Encephalitis is often classified as primary or postinfectious/parainfectious. In primary encephalitis the illness is due to the direct invasion and replication of an infectious agent within the brain, whereas postinfectious/parainfectious occurs after, or in combination with, another noncentral nervous system illness or following the administration of a vaccine or other product.",

Other herpes group viruses (EBV, CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7) may occasionally cause encephalitis. There is a particular risk of encephalitis with these viruses in immunocompromised patients due to reactivation of latent virus. In primary infection with EBV resulting in infectious mononucleosis, about 1% of cases will develop encephalitis during the course of the illness.

Stained smears should be examined for usual pathogens as well as for parasites. PCR should be performed to identify herpes group viruses and enteroviruses. Viral cultures and PCR of blood, throat, and stool specimens should be obtained. Serologic studies in encephalitis can be very useful but most often they are done inappropriately. The demonstration of a significant titer rise to an infectious agent is most important. This requires the collection of both an acute-phase and a convalescent-phase specimen. In general, these specimens should be studied at the same time. Except for a few specific IgM antibody tests, the examination of an acute-phase specimen alone results in misdiagnoses. Particularly problematic in this regard is the examination of enteroviral antibody panels. Also problematic is the examination of the CSF for antibodies to infectious agents.",
