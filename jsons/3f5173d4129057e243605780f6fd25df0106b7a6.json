It can also be used for studying the social impact of the crisis. One critical step in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP), as for most types of text analysis, is the identification of relevant keywords and phrases as well as the detection of synonymous expressions. This so-called named entity recognition (NER) and disambiguation can be especially challenging with newly emerging diseases such as COVID-19 because no official name had been defined during the early phases of the outbreak. Instead, authors used a wide range of descriptive terms such as \"Wuhan seafood market pneumonia\". NER can be performed using dictionaries of keywords or with the help of models, which are often trained on annotated corpora in which keywords have been labelled manually by experts (gold standard) or automatically (silver standard) 1 . Dictionary and model-based methods can also be combined as the approaches are complimentary. Here, we have developed a toolbox for NLP related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. It includes English dictionaries of synonymous terms as well as an annotated gold and silver standard corpus. This work will be expanded over the next weeks but due to the exceptional circumstances of the current health crisis we have chosen to release the tools already at this stage so that other researchers can use them and contribute to their improvement. Updated versions will be published on https://github.com/Aitslab/corona.",

The 987 detected records were downloaded in text format (even those containing only a heading and no abstract). The text was stripped of hyphens and '/'s replaced with blank spaces. Tokenization (chopping up text into individual words/terms), and detection of dictionary terms was performed with spacy (https://spacy.io/) pipeline using the spacylookup module in a capitalization-independent manner. A second tokenization step was performed by splitting the terms matching the dictionaries on blank spaces. Annotations were stored in IOB2 format where the first token of an entity is labelled 'B', subsequent tokens belonging to the entity are labelled 'I', and all other tokens are labelled 'O'. When matches were found in both dictionaries, the correct one was selected manually. . From the abstracts loaded into BioQRator without error, 10 were randomly selected and subsequently annotated for the following concepts:",
