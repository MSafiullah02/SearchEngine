She had always had a strong sense of adventure and pioneering spirit and, in 1951, she commenced practice in South Africa. Later, she moved to Kenya and joined the well known Veterinary Research Institute at Kabete near Nairobi. Marjorie enjoyed working in Kenya, where there was a constant challenge to use basic veterinary principles to provide a diagnostic service for commercial and wild animals. Her two daughters were born during this period in Kenya.

With her colleagues, Ifor Owen and Noel Talbot, she showed a remarkable ability to use good practical commonsense to simplify what seemed to be highly complex issues. When the new laboratory was built, she was able to demonstrate her considerable laboratory skills to all and was a good but firm teacher to many. This was a happy and productive period of her life. Marjorie was very good with animals of all species ranging from the usual to exotic species such as crocodiles. Because of her combination of ability and character, she was the 'preferred vet' in a strongly male-dominated society, which reflected her high standing in the community.
