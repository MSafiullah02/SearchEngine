The assay takes approximately 48 hours to perform and utilizes the same rabbit antirhinovirus hyperimmune serum as both the capture and detecting antibody. The latter has been biotin-labelled and is detected via a streptavidin (3-galactosidase preformed complex. This new assay has been found to be very sensitive, detecting human rhinovirus (HRV)-EL and HRV-2 at titres as low as TCID,,, 100 PI-' and t10' TCID,, 100 PI-', respectively. Furthermore, when 57 different human rhinovirus serotypes were tested in both the HRV-EL and HRV-2 ELISA systems a total of 49 (86%) were found to be cross-reactive. Of 36 clinical specimens tested by virus isolation, cell-culture-amplified (CCA) ELISA, and direct ELISA, 15 were positive by isolation, 1 1 by CCA-ELISA, and 1 1 by direct ELISA. The overall correlation of the CCA and direct ELISA techniques with virus isolation was found to be 88.9% and 66.7%, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the ELISA system developed is a sensitive technique for the diagnosis of rhinovirus infections.",

Most rhinovirus infections are trivial and self-limiting in that only a minor upper respiratory tract illness of some 2-5 days duration occurs. However, in a proportion of cases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children with a history of bronchitis and allergy, infection can be more serious [Craighead et al, 19691 . In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that rhinovirus infections are associated with exacerbations of bronchitis and asthma [Gregg, 19831 . Furthermore, Krilov et a1 have recently detected rhinoviruses in 9 out of 53 (17%) specimens from infants with lower respiratory tract infection [Krilov et al, 19861 . Rhinoviruses are therefore appropriate targets for treatment with antiviral chemotherapeutic agents.",

Figure 2 shows the results obtained with nasal washings, collected from three volunteers on consecutive days following HKV-EL or saline challenge, tested in both the cell-culture-amplified (CCA)-ELISA and direct ELISA systems. The figure also illustrates the good correlation obtained between CCA-ELISA, direct ELISA, and virus isolation in detecting positive or negative specimens from these three volunteers. Nasal washings collected 3 or 4 days after inoculation with HRV-EL or saline from 18 volunteers who participated in a trial were investigated by all three methods",

Hence, the direct ELISA showed 66.7% agreement with either virus isolation or It is noteworthy that all the control nasal washings collected from the four volunteers who were challenged with saline instead of HRV-EL (N.O., A.C., J.

            "text": "In this paper we describe the first ELISA system for rhinovirus detection. The assay was found to be simple, rapid, and capable of detecting a large number of human rhinovirus serotypes. It is a reliable method for the detection of HRV-EL antigen in clinical specimens, and results have suggested that the limits of detection were as low as lo1-' TCID,, lOOpl-' and <lo1 TCID,, 100pl-l for HRV-EL and HRV-2 antigen, respectively. The assay offers three distinct advantages over virus isolation in cell culture. Firstly, the test is rapid, requiring only 48 hours to complete once antibody coated plates are available whereas virus isolation and serological identification may take as long as 2 4 weeks. Secondly, the ELISA, as demonstrated in this study, is capable of detecting noninfectious as well as infectious virus (some volunteers showed r4-fold rises in antibody titre, were ELISA positive yet did not excrete virus); hence, the need to preserve infectivity of virus in the clinical specimen may not be essential. Thirdly, as tests are read spectrophotometrically evaluation of results is objective rather than subjective. A biotin-avidin ELISA utilising the enzyme ,f3-galactosidase was developed in this study because of the following advantages over conventional ELISA. The high affinity of avidin for biotin (affinity constant = 1015 mol-') [Green, 19751 ensures that the biotinavidin complexes are not easily dissociated by the washing steps in the test and hence this may result in enhanced sensitivity [Guesdon et al, 19791 . Furthermore; one molecule of avidin is capable of binding four molecules of biotin and biotin can be covalently linked to antibody without affecting the antigen binding capacity [Guesden et al, 19791 . It is more specific as the enzyme P-galactosidase prepared from Escherichia coli and used in this assay has characteristics different from those found in human tissues under the conditions of the assay. Therefore by employing a 0-galactosidase-based substrate (ONPG), high background readings-as seen with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase-were avoided.",

This would suggest that an antirhinovirus serum is capable of binding not only its homologous virus but also a number of heterologous viruses. However, the degree of cross-reactivity depends on how close the serological relationship is between the test virus and that against which the hyperimmune serum was prepared. Nevertheless, our data clearly suggest that it may be possible to prepare a hyperimmune serum capable of detecting many rhinoviruses by including a number of rhinovirus serotypes in the initial inoculum. Indeed, in this study we demonstrated that by using the two ELISAs (for HRV-EL and HRV-2) we were able to detect a large number of the human rhinoviruses investigated (OD 2 2 x OD of control antigen). Alternatively, it may be possible to develop hyperimmune sera or monoclonal antibodies with C-type reactivity capable of detecting an even larger number of rhinovirus serotypes.",

            "text": "Although we would like to emphasise that our data are preliminary, both the direct and CCA-ELISAs gave a good correlation with virus isolation when used to detect rhinovirus antigens in nasal washings (obtained from 18 volunteers challenged with either HRV-EL or saline). However, the CCA-ELISA showed better correlation (88.9%) with virus isolation than the direct assay (66.7%). This was not totally unexpected as both virus isolation and the CCA-ELISA depend on the presence of viable virus rather than antigen. The inclusion of an amplification stage in the ELISA system may be necessary when virus is present at a low concentration (<lo2 TCID,, ml-I), as is often found with nasal washings obtained from adults. The addition of an amplification stage in the assay does not, in our opinion, increase the work or time load of the test, as whilst the ELISA plates are precoated overnight with the capture antibody nasal washings are inoculated into monolayer cell cultures. Recent studies with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza virus have suggested that cell culture amplification followed by immunofluorescent staining was necessary for the detection of virus present at low concentration in urine [Griffiths et al, 1984; Alpert et al, 19851 or throat swabs [Espy et al, 19861 , respectively. Since rhinoviruses are also excreted at low concentrations, particularly by adults, and as nasal washings (although the optimal method of collecting a rhinovirus specimen for virus isolation) contribute further to the dilution of the excreted virus, we feel that the CCA-ELISA may be the method of choice for the detection of rhinoviruses when present at low concentrations.",

However, when our ELISAs are employed this time interval is reduced to 48 hours. In addition, by reacting the same clinical specimen with both a pre-immunisation and a hyperimmune rabbit serum as capture antibodies, as in the direct method, the ELISA can offer an in-built confirmation stage. It is therefore our aim to further modify the ELISAs described in this paper in order to improve sensitivity and decrease the time required to obtain results to within a few hours [same day diagnosis]. These developments will be essential if antiviral chemotherapy becomes available and a rapid diagnosis is therefore required in order to initiate treatment in individuals who may be at risk of developing more serious lower respiratory tract complications following rhinovirus infection.",
