The mean age of cats diagnosed with intracranial neoplasms was previously reported as 11.3 \u00b1 3.8 years (range 0.5\u201321.5 years).3 Cats with ependymomas were found to be significantly younger (8.2 \u00b1 3.3 years) in comparison to those with meningiomas (12.2 \u00b1 3.3 years).3, 5 A mild bias for female cats was seen with ependymomas in one study, a correlation with breed was not established.5 Surgical excision with resolution of clinical signs has been reported in one cat with a third ventricular ependymoma.7\n",

Malignant characteristics include anaplasia, a high mitotic rate, necrosis, and invasion of neighboring parenchyma.1, 9 In humans, ependymomas can occur in any age group, but are more commonly seen in children with no clear sex predilection. In humans, ependymomas occur slightly more frequently infratentorially (60%) than supratentorially (40%), with supratentorial ependymomas being more often intraparenchymal/intra\u2010axial than intraventricular.8 In children, masses tend to be infratentorial, occurring in the posterior fossa, while supratentorial masses are more common in adults.8 A supratentorial intraventricular location is more frequently reported in dogs and cats.1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 In cats, most ependymomas have been reported to originate from the walls of the lateral and third ventricles.2, 3, 5, 6, 7 Ependymomas have been less frequently reported to occur in the subarachnoid space, fourth ventricle, mesencephalic aqueduct, and central canal of the spinal cord.5\n",
