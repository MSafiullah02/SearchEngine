While criticisms on this work have been posted [10] , other reports indicate that genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to multiple outbreak sources of transmission [11, 12] . The typing of SARS-CoV-2 can be repeated by other group, though the two clades exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.

Moreover, a sequence encoding amino acids PRRA is inserted into the genome of SARS-CoV-2; together with the following R within the original sequence of the S protein, a polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) at the junction of S1 and S2 for Furin protease is generated, making the virus more infectious than SARS-CoV [15, 16] .

According to the SARS-CoV model [19] and recent advances [15, 16] , SARS-CoV-2 may enter target cells through an endosomal pathway ( Fig. 1 ): S protein binds to ACE2 and is translocated to endosomes, where S protein is cleaved by the endosomal acid proteases (cathepsin L) to activate its fusion activity. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a Furin cleavage site (R-X-X-R; X, any amino acid), facilitating the virus to enter into target cells and making it more infectious than the SARS virus [16] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome is released and translated and the protein products are processed by viral proteinases. Meanwhile, the subgenomic negative-strand templates are synthesized and made as a template for genomic RNA. The synthesized genomic RNA assembles with nucleocapsid (N) protein in the cytoplasm to form viral nucleocapsids, which bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment [19] .

In a recent report of 1099 patients, lymphocytopenia was present in 914 (83.2%) of the patients on admission [23] . On the other hand, significant elevation of some cytokines is reported in sera or plasma examination. For example, initial plasma concentrations of interleukin-1B (IL-1B), IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interferon \u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP1), MIP1A, MIP1B, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy adults, and concentrations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher in intensive care unit (ICU) patients than non-ICU patients [20] . Another study showed that compared to the mild cases, the severe COVID-19 showed significant decrease in T cells (especially CD8 + T cells) and increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the peripheral blood, which gradually recovered in patients who survived the disease [24, 25] . Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8 + T cell ratio were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 [24] .

CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and CD16 + /CD56 + NK cells were reduced in COVID-19 patients [26] . CD3 -/ CD16 + /CD56 + NK cells and CD3 + /CD16 + /CD56 + NK T cells were decreased in 11 COVID-19 with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-like disease [27] .

CRS was first reported in 1989 when the anti-T cell antibody muromonab-CD3 was used in the treatment of solid organ transplantation [29] . CRS is a life-threatening toxicity that may lead to detrimental effects such as leakage from capillaries, tissue toxicity and edema, organ failure and shock. The syndromes of CRS include sustained fever, hepatomegaly with liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, cytopenia, skin rash, and variable neurologic symptoms (Table 1) , which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from those of the underlying diseases [30] .

In SARS-CoV-induced severe disease, the levels of IL-6 was significantly elevated [31] .

Clinical studies have shown significant elevation of cytokines and lymphocytopenia in COVID-19. These cytokines include IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-1, and others. The elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients [34] . An analysis of dynamic characteristics of host immune system in 3 critical cases showed that hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels [35] , and the lymphocytopenia and cytotoxicity may be the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection [36] . An observation showed that after SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD4 + T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate cytokines including GM-CSF. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes with high level of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These T cells and monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation, where the monocytes become macrophages [9] . These cells, together with other cells [28] , trigger CRS [37] . While IFN-\u03b3 may initiate cytokine storm in SARS patients [38] , several cytokines including IL-6 may trigger CRS in COVID-19. Other cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, may also play a role in SARS-CoV-2-induced CRS, and transcription factors such as NF-kB may play a role in regulating cytokine release. The consequence of CRS include epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage, suboptimal T cell response (impaired virus clearance), accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages and altered tissue homeostasis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [33] . CRS is associated with necrosis and tissue destruction and related symptoms such as extensive pulmonary edema, acute bronchopneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, reactive hemophagocytosis, and ARDS [10] (Fig. 3) , which is confirmed by histological examination of COVID-19 patients' lungs [36, 39] . The necropsy investigation also shows the infiltration of macrophages and activation of alveolar macrophages in fatal patients.

Some people doubted that this virus might be uncontainable and a \"let go\" policy might be suitable for this pandemic since the cost will be too high to afford strict social distancing and isolation. This notion may be inappropriate for some reasons. Firstly, the historic experience with both SARS and MERS demonstrated that coronavirus with high virulence do have tendency of self-limitation. Secondly, recent studies reported that the asymptomatic cases with transmissibility account for only a small proportion (889/ 72 314, 1.2%) of COVID-19 patient [43] . Thirdly, preliminary data on the recovered cases showed the presence of a very high titer of neutralizing antibodies (39/40 with titer of at least 1:640 while the remaining one had a titer of 1:32 [44] ), indicating the high probability of viral clearance in the great majority of infected populations. Thanks to domestic medical workers' great efforts, central and local governments' tremendous input, the contributions from the volunteers and warm-hearted people, and international supports, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China has been significantly constrained, providing firm evidence that this virus is containable. In some countries outside of China, the policy-makers recognize China's experience in combating COVID-19, while some others decide to apply sound policy of welldesigned containment strategy and to avoid limitation of herd immunity.
