Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the types of aminopeptidase activities in human nasal mucosa. Methods: Human nasal mucosa was homogenized (n = 12), and cytoplasmic (S2) and membrane-rich (P2) fractions were obtained. Several aminopeptidase (Ap) activities were defined by (1) substrate specificity with leucine-enkephalin (leu-Ap) and alanine-nitroanilide (ala-Ap), (2) inhibitor studies with puromycin and bestatin, (3) enzyme activity histochemistry (zymography), (4) immunohistochemistry, and (5) gel electrophoresis. Human volunteers had methacholine, histamine, and allergen nasal provocations to determine the mechanisms controlling nasal aminopeptidase secretion in vivo.",

In airway mucosa, aminopeptidases may be critical for the generation of bradykinin but may also reduce the duration of action of bradykinin, neuropeptides released from nociceptive neurons (eg, substance P), and other proinflammatory peptides. [4] [5] [6] [7] Aminopeptidase activities have frequently been identified with the use of leucine-enkephalin (enkephalindegrading aminopeptidase, leu-Ap) as a substrate. 4, 8 The major enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase activities were initially described on the basis of their arylamidase activity 8 but have subsequently been referred to as either aminopeptidase M (ApM, also known as aminopeptidase N, CD13) or the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PS-Ap). [9] [10] [11] [12] ApM is an integral membrane protein that is relatively resistant to inhibition by puromycin with coefficients of inhibition (Ki) of 100 \u00b5mol/L to 1 mmol/L. 4, 13 PS-Ap is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme but can be found associated with membranes. It is more sensitive to inhibition by puromycin (Ki approximately 1 \u00b5mol/L). 4, 7 Both ApM and PS-AP are inhibited by bestatin. The cDNAs for rat kidney ApM 9 and human PSAp 14 have been cloned and their respective amino acid sequences deduced.",

Pretreatment with atropine blocked the methacholine-induced leu-Ap release (6.27 \u00b1 1.85 pmol/min/mL, range 0.41 to 17.77). Histamine increased leu-Ap to 9.68 \u00b1 1.73 pmol/min/mL (range 2.13 to 20.53). Methacholine stimulated glandular exocytosis and secretion, whereas histamine caused vascular leak with extravasation of plasma proteins plus stimulation of nociceptive nerves and recruitment of cholinergic reflexes that cause glandular exocytosis.

After methacholine provocations (Fig  7, a, b, and c) , leu-Ap was highly correlated with lactoferrin (r = 0.90, P < .01) and total protein (r = .95, P < .01), whereas leu-Ap and albumin secretion were not correlated (r = 0.05, not significant).

These data are in agreement with other studies of histamine provocations that show parallel stimulation of both vascular permeability and cholinergic reflex-mediated glandular secretion.

Nasal lavages were enriched with total protein, albumin, IgG, and lactoferrin.

There were no significant differences between individual time points because of the wide variances in leu-Ap values.

Cell surface aminopeptidase acts as a binding site for coronaviruses. 26 It is conceivable that mucus aminopeptidase may bind to these virions to prevent epithelial cell binding, uptake, and infection. Virion destruction could be mediated by plasma proteins because aminopeptidases generate bradykinin from one of its precursors, lysyl-bradykinin (kallidin). 5, 27, 28 Bradykinin potently stimulates vascular permeability that causes flooding of the airway lumen by immunoglobulin-containing, complement-containing, and fibrin-containing plasma. Vasodilation, nociceptive sensory nerve activation that conveys sensations of burning pain, and arachidonic acid metabolism that promotes additional glandular exocytosis, also occur. 29 Bradykinin is elevated in secretions during the common cold 5 and after allergen provocation. 27 However, bradykinin antagonists have had little effect in the common cold, and inhibition of aminopeptidase with bestatin does not accentuate the vascular permeability induced by tobacco in the hamster cheek pouch model. 30 These findings suggest an alternative hypothesis: Secretion of glandular aminopeptidase along with kininogens of vascular and glandular origin into the airway mucus leads to bradykinin production that is only the consequence and marker of their parallel secretion rather than the primary cause of mucosal inflammation. These competing hypotheses require additional testing that should include human nasal provocations with aminopeptidase inhibitors such as bestatin.",
