            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes covid-19, was first reported to WHO as a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. 1 While the initial outbreak was mostly confined to the epicentre in China, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spreads internationally causing a global pandemic. By 15 March, the number of cases outside of China surpassed those in China, and as of 12 April 2020, over 1.8 million cases and 110 000 deaths were reported worldwide, affecting 185 countries. 2 The most common symptoms of covid-19 include fever, dry cough, myalgia or fatigue, as is the case in many other viral infections. 3 4 According to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 44 672 laboratory confirmed, 10 567 clinically diagnosed and 16 186 suspected cases of covid-19, 81.4% exhibited mild illness (with no or mild symptoms of pneumonia), 13.9% had severe symptoms (dyspnoea with respiratory rate \u226530/ min, SpO 2 \u226493%, PaO 2 /FiO 2 <300 and/or infiltration of lung field >50% within 24-48 hours), and 4.7% were critically ill (respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiorgan failure). 5 In patients with severe or critical disease, viral pneumonia can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multisystem failure accompanied by a cytokine storm. 5 Since patients with covid-19 with cardiovascular comorbidities have higher mortality, 5 and the severity of covid-19 disease correlates with cardiovascular manifestations, 6 it is important to understand the interaction of covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review will summarise our current understanding of the cardiovascular manifestations of covid-19, as compared with SARS (caused by SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (caused by MERS-CoV) and influenza. We will also discuss cardiovascular considerations regarding treatment strategies.",

However, in hospitalised patients with covid-19 with more severe disease, DM, hypertension and CVD seem to be more prevalent in both the USA and China, similar to MERS and influenza (table 2) . A retrospective, single-centre case series of 187 patients with covid-19 found that patients with underlying CVD were more likely to have cardiac injury (troponin (Tn) elevation) compared with patients without CVD (54.5% vs 13.2%). 6 In-hospital mortality was 7.6% for patients without underlying CVD and normal Tn, 13.3% for those with CVD and normal Tn, 37.5% for those without CVD but elevated Tn and 69.4% for those with CVD and elevated Tn. 6 These observations suggest that although patients with pre-existing CVD may not be more susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, they are prone to more severe complications of covid-19 with increased mortality. 7 The association of cardiovascular and other comorbidities with case fatality rate is summarised in figure 1.",

The mechanisms of cardiovascular injury from covid-19 have not been fully elucidated and are likely multifactorial. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified by RT-PCR in cardiac tissue in some cases, 15 supporting that direct cardiotoxicity may occur. Virally driven hyperinflammation with cytokine release may lead to vascular inflammation, plaque instability, myocardial inflammation, a hypercoagulable state, and direct myocardial suppression. 16 17 Other systemic consequences of covid-19 infection, including sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), may also mediate cardiac injury. Based on postmortem biopsies, the pathological features of covid-19 in multiple organs greatly resemble those seen in SARS 18 19 and MERS. 20 21 In cardiac tissue, pathological findings vary from minimal change to interstitial inflammatory infiltration and myocyte necrosis (table 3). In the vasculature, microthrombosis and vascular inflammation could be found (table 3) .",

This supply and demand mismatch may lead to sustained myocardial ischaemia in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. However, a rise and/ or fall of hs-cTn is not sufficient to secure the diagnosis of acute MI as seen in MI with non-obstructive coronaries, even in the absence of covid-19.

Reports of various presentations of non-ischaemic myocardial injury in covid-19 are summarised in table 5. The distinction between myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy can be challenging, since cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and/or biopsy are not available in most cases. Fried et al and Sala et al each reported a patient with covid-19 with mid-left ventricular (LV) or basal-to-mid LV hypokinesis, a pattern of mid-ventricular, or reverse Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy, respectively. 32 33 The incidence of acute heart failure was 33% (7/21) in critically ill patients with covid-19 without a past history of LV systolic dysfunction in Washington state. 34 Importantly, cardiomyopathy can develop in covid-19 with mild or absent respiratory symptoms. 35 Myocardial injury with cytokine release syndrome Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can elicit the intense release of multiple cytokines and chemokines by the immune system. 3 36 Cytokine release syndrome (aka 'cytokine storm'), a poorly understood immunopathological process caused by hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, T helper 1 cytokine interferon-gamma, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), has been reported in the setting of SARS, MERS, and influenza. [37] [38] [39] It is postulated that proinflammatory cytokines depress myocardial function immediately through activation of the neural sphingomyelinase pathway and subacutely (hours to days) via nitric oxide-mediated blunting of beta-adrenergic signalling. 40 Accumulating evidence suggest that a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 can develop cytokine storm. 36 Plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 have been found to be significantly higher in patients with covid-19. 3 The clinical and biochemical profiles of non-survivors in patients with covid-19 with highly elevated ferritin and IL-6 also suggest that cytokine release contribute to mortality. 41",

Low molecular weight heparin is likely preferred in critically ill patients with covid-19, if anticoagulation is used.",

After cell entry via ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 appears to subsequently downregulate ACE2 expression, which is vital to maintenance of cardiac function. 49 In mouse models, reduction in ACE2 expression is associated with increased severity of lung injury induced by influenza. 50 Whether higher expression of ACE2 increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or confers cardioprotection remains controversial. 51 Furthermore, experimental animal models and few studies in humans have yielded conflicting results as to whether RAAS inhibition increases ACE2 expression. 52 53 Based on the uncertainty regarding the overall effect of RAAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy) in covid-19, multiple specialty societies currently recommend that RAAS inhibitors be continued in patients in otherwise stable condition. 51",

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic which acts against Zika and Ebola viruses in vitro 58 and suppresses inflammatory processes, 59 has been proposed as an effective adjunct to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 through unclear mechanisms. 57 Although the preliminary evidence for quinoline antimalarials may be promising, it should be taken with caution until randomised clinical trials are completed. Both chloroquine and azithromycin have generally favourable safety profiles, but they are known to cause cardiovascular side effects including prolongation of QT interval. 60 Although azithromycin interferes minimally with the cytochrome P-450 system in vitro, 61 chloroquine is metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5, 62 and there is a potentially enhanced risk of significant QT prolongation induced by combination therapy.
