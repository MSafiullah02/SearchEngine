Other infections caused by pneumococcus include bacteremia , otitis media, and meningitis. In bacterial meningitis, pneumococcus is associated with mortality rates ranging from 16% to 37%. About 30\u201350% of adult survivors present permanent residual symptoms [8, 9]. The study by Van Boeckel et al. [10], regarding global antibiotic consumption from 2000 to 2010, reported that it grew by more than 30%, from approximately 50 billion to 70 billion standard units. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and macrolides were the three most consumed antibiotics in 2010. The three countries that consumed the most antibiotics in 2010 were India with 13 billion standard units, China with 10 billion, and the United States with 7 billion standard units (a standard unit is the number of doses sold; the IMS Health database identifies a dose as a pill, capsule, or ampoule).",

In a patient treated with a dose of intravenous penicillin, the levels achieved in the lung will be 100 times greater than those reached in the brain. Thus, use of low concentrations of \u03b2-lactam for pneumococcal infections, such as otitis media or meningitis, could lead to treatment failure. In contrast, with pulmonary infections the levels of \u03b2-lactam reached are generally sufficient to clear infection. Therefore, treating the same pathogen will require different doses of a given \u03b2-lactam depending on the site of infection. Likewise, we must considerer pneumococcal resistance in different sites of infection differently, and breakpoints for resistance will be different.",

One involves target-site (ribosomal) alteration by an enzyme that methylates 23S rRNA, an enzyme that is encoded by the ermB (erythromycin-resistance methylase) gene. The resistance phenotype is called MLSB (macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin B type) and is responsible for a high level of macrolide resistance.

As with other bacteria, resistant pneumococcus exhibits spontaneous point mutations in a region of GyrA (gyrase) and ParC (topoisomerase IV) called the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR). Some pneumococci may also exhibit an efflux-mediated mechanism, although the clinical significance is unclear. The presence of dual mechanisms of resistance has been reported in strains having high levels of resistance, often from cases of treatment failure [12, 42, 43]. In some cases multiple mutations in the target proteins accumulate [44], which supports the idea that repeated antimicrobial challenge gradually erodes the effectiveness of fluoroquinolones.",

The study analyzed 303 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia.

In a second study with the same bacteremic population, Ruhe et al. [62] identified 33 (11%) cases of bacteremia caused by high-level resistant S. pneumoniae. In these cases, three risk factors for high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infection were identified: \u03b2-lactam antibiotic use in the previous 6 months, previous residence in a risk area (defined as stays in day-care facilities, prisons, homeless shelters, nursing homes, or other long-term care facilities), and respiratory tract infection in the previous year.",

The most widely used antibiotics were penicillins (including broad-spectrum penicillins). Macrolides were the second most widely used category; the third consisted of cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Fluoroquinolones occupied the fourth position.

The study also suggested that the heptavalent vaccine is failing to reduce antimicrobial resistance, possibly due to the increased consumption of azithromycin (p = 0.04).

            "text": "There are 98 reported pneumococcal serotypes (capsule type); 92 were identified using the Quellung method, and the additional serotypes were identified using molecular techniques [101\u2013103]. These serotypes are grouped into 48 serogroups based on their antigenic similarities [104]. Several epidemiological studies suggest that relationships exist between specific serotypes/serogroups and the age of the host, site of infection, comorbidities, geographic region, pneumococcal invasiveness, and disease severity [105\u2013108]. As pointed out above, serotype differences also relate to antimicrobial resistance. The differing behavior among serotypes may reflect differences in nasopharyngeal carriage , with the highest rates in children, especially in the first year of life. As pointed out above, risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage in children include winter season, age below 6 years, presence of younger siblings, and attendance in day-care centers. In adults, risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage include cigarette smoking, asthma, and acute upper respiratory infection [64, 109, 110].",

PCV13 contains capsular polysaccharides from serotypes 1, 3, 4,6A, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. In March 2010, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that PCV13 replace PCV7 for the vaccination of children. New studies show a similar reduction in IPD following the introduction of the PCV13 vaccine, as seen previously with the PCV7 vaccine. The study by Moore et al. [126] analyzed IPD cases (33,688 cases, of which 89% contained serotyping results) during July 2004\u2013June 2013 and classified as being caused by the PCV13 serotypes against which PCV7 has no effect (PCV13/nonPCV7). The work found a reduction in IPD in adults associated with PCV13 introduction in children. In all adult age groups, PCV13/nonPCV7-type IPD (especially serotypes 19A and 7F) declined by 58\u201372%, which was comparable to that observed early after PCV7 introduction. The PCV13 led to overall reductions of IPD of 12\u201332% [126]. However, the phenomenon of serotype replacement, which is thought to be caused by non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) that occupy nasopharyngeal natural niches vacated after pneumococcal vaccination, is again observed with pneumococcal serotypes 11A, 15A, 23B, and 35B, the most frequent serotypes. Serotypes 15A and 23B show a high proportion of penicillin non-susceptibility [127].",

            "text": "The relevance of penicillin-resistant to clinical outcome in cases of pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. Several studies showed that treatment failure in CAP cases does not occur when appropriate therapy and doses are used, even in those patients infected with non-susceptible strains and treated with \u03b2-lactams. For example, in 2010 a Spanish study analyzed 1041 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia in which 114 (11%) presented septic shock. The main risk factors were current smoking, chronic corticosteroid therapy, and serotype 3 pneumococcus. No difference was found regarding genotypes or patterns of antibiotic resistance between patients with or without septic shock [128]. Similarly, a study by Morgandon et al. [129], concerning severe pneumococcal pneumonia in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), reported that risk factors for mortality were age, male sex, and renal replacement therapy. Comorbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia , or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome in these cases. These studies suggest that the outcome with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia is probably associated with the clinical presentation of pneumonia rather than the antibiotic resistance of the pneumococcus strain. A plausible explanation is that antibiotic concentrations achieved in the lung are usually higher than the pneumococcal MIC for more than 40\u201350% of the dosing interval, even with resistant strains. It will now be interesting to determine whether infection by strains having a very high level of resistance to \u03b2-lactams (MIC \u2265 16 \u03bcg/ml) correlates with clinical failure with pneumonia patients.",

[134] evaluated the impact of levofloxacin resistance on 136 adult patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). In this work, pneumonia was the most frequent disease (68%), followed by primary bacteremia (11%) and meningitis (11%). The rate of levofloxacin resistance in invasive pneumococcal isolates was 3.7% (5/136) of the isolates. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 26.5% (36/136). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients with IPD were corticosteroid use, presentation with septic shock, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The authors found an association between levofloxacin resistance and increased mortality, although statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.083). However, multivariate analysis revealed that presentation with septic shock, corticosteroid use, development of ARDS, and levofloxacin resistance were independent factors associated with 30-day mortality.",
