By late April, I had already done press briefings and several individual interviews, where I shared what little information we had at the time, and tried to place that in context. One evening, after successfully finishing what was expected to be a very difficult live television interview, I was feeling much relief and delight. I returned to our crowded emergency operations center to reconnect with my colleagues. I found them huddled around a speaker phone, looking ashen. They had just conferred with a state's public health officials about a pregnant woman who was critically ill with what was likely to be the new virus. She was not expected to make it. The 2009 H1N1 virus was not a practice exercise. Real people were going to get very ill and people who were not supposed to die that year were going to\u2013even if we all did everything we could, even if all the parts of the public health and health care delivery systems rose to the occasion, and even if we had much good fortune. That is what a new influenza virus does. At this point, we could not say how large the problem would get or how many lives were threatened. But we knew that for this woman, and her family and caregivers, the reality was overwhelming.",

There had been some sort of collusion to keep that information from her, but the nurse had not been in on the full plan. My grandmother said on hearing the nurse's words, she immediately realized what must have happened, and she fainted. When she came to, her own healthy baby girl was there. They named their daughter Betsy, in memory of the aunt she would never meet. And Grandma said for each of her next 3 deliveries, she just passed out\u2013reliving the shock she had experienced at learning of her sister's death, and miraculously being spared the pains of childbirth.",

Instead, I was immersed in the public health emergency in China, where the SARS pandemic was centered. My public health counterparts in Beijing had the difficult task of triaging the scarce intensive care unit beds spread across the city. They had convened each evening to sort out who was about to die, how many more beds would thus open up, and which patients would get them. There were doctors, nurses, and medical professors in some of those intensive care unit beds. My counterparts had to manage the epidemic while some of their longtime colleagues and friends were dying from it.

I first saw the data in this graph in February 2010, and again found myself feeling grateful to live in the modern era. A few months later, I read a book a colleague had sent me, William Maxwell's novel They Came Like Swallows. It is a story of a family's experience set during the 1918 great influenza pandemic. In the story, a pregnant mother is sent away from her young son, to protect her after her son had been exposed to the fever that was going around at the time.
