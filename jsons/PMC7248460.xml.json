Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) is considered the gold standard method for measuring tear production; however, it does not measure tear quality [7]. The tear ferning test (TFT) is a qualitative test developed for humans, and it has become a useful diagnostic tool in tear ferning research. Various ferning patterns can be observed as a result of tear crystallization after evaporation of lacrimal samples, and these patterns depend mostly on TF composition [8]. In addition, tear crystallization may be affected by humidity and temperature [9, 10]. Therefore, changes in ferning patterns are believed to reflect possible changes in both composition and stability of the TF [10].",

Furthermore, this technique can be used without necessitating further manipulation of the eye. The STT strip is made of soft, absorbent and malleable paper, thereby minimizing reflex tearing or damage to the cornea and adjacent structures during tear collection. In contrast, tear collection with capillary microtube can lead to eye damage caused by voluntary and involuntary movements of cats, as they were not sedated in this study [5, 22, 23]. This is especially important if more than one test is performed during the same examination, as the manipulation of cats\u2019 eyes can lead to exfoliation of conjunctival cells and/or release of TF components that are not normally expressed. Therefore, STT-1 tear sample collection was performed before any other clinical and ophthalmic tests [24].",

Therefore, the adoption of the two scales aimed to minimize the subjectivity of the test in cat samples. A similar observation has already been made in TFT studies for other species, such as dogs [13] and capuchin monkeys [15], and as happened in these studies we suggest that the adoption of a species-specific scale can be a way to enhance pattern classification. It is worth noting that the TFT is described as a complementary test to other methods [9, 10, 20, 25, 26], and will certainly contribute to better understanding of the ocular surface in all species.",

Therefore, these findings suggest that Rolando types I and II and Masmali grades 0, 1 and 2 reflect normal TFT results in cats. While the results of most cats fell within types I and II of Rolando scale the grades 1 and 2 of Masmali scale, this can be attributed to the species-specific differences between human and feline tear film. Masmali grade 2 can be considered a normal tear pattern for the species, because cats studied were clinically healthy. For this reason, future complementary studies are necessary in comparing healthy eyes with different ocular surface disease in cats. Both scales can be feasible options for grading tear crystallization in cats, but as Rolando scale included 96.6% of the samples in the 2 types that are considered normal for humans, we think that this scale seemed to be more precise to classify crystallization pattern in cats. The crystallization patterns observed in this study can form the basis for standardizing the TFT of domestic cats.",
