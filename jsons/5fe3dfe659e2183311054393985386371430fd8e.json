(f) Modelling: Multi-event capture-mark-recapture approach Goodness-of-fit (model validation): The use of CMR and MECMR models relies on severalimportant assumptions, which we detail and test in this section, using a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test. This test allows us to check the validity of the model, by verifying that the \"detected section of the population\" is representative of the section of the population that is undetected. More specifically, this test allows to verify that the fate and the detection of a given individual is (1) independent from the fate and the detection of any other individual, and that it is not influenced by (2) the monitoring design or the (3) behaviour of that individual(Pradel, Gimenez & Lebreton 2005;Choquet et al. 2009). Any violation in these assumptions can lead to the underestimation of the variance of parameters and result in the selection of potentially biased (over-parameterized) modelsChoquet et al. 2009).",

Thus, low-ranking breeders should be more infected with CDV (as found in East et al. 2015 with a hookworm parasite). NB.H.S > NB.L.SExposure to CDV should be higher for highranking than low-ranking non-breeders because high-ranking non-breeders have higher contact rates, including contacts to cubs at the entrance of den holes and aerosol infection while sniffing dens(East, Hofer & Turk 1989).\u03b2: NB.H.S < NB.L.S High-ranking non-breeders should have a (slightly) higher opportunity to allocate body resources to immune processes than low-ranking ones.
