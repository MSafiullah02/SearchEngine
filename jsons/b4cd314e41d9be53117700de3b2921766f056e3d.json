Mello and Andrew Fire reported a gene silencing effect after injecting dsRNA into C. elegans [7] . They observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections had an effect on protein production, but that dsRNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term 'RNAi'. This discovery resulted in the identification of the causative agent of a previously inexplicable phenomenon and for this Fire and Mello were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006. Later, this phenomenon was studied in organisms ranging from worms [7] to trypanosomes [8] to flies [9] . Initial experiments in mammals proved disappointing, because introduction of dsRNA triggered the interferon response leading to alteration in cellular metabolism [10] . To avoid this, small RNAs were chemically synthesized and used. This resulted in the desired gene-specific silencing and established that RNAi also operates in mammalian cells [11, 12] . Subsequently, it was established that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the mediators of mRNA degradation in the process of RNAi [13] . In 2003, therapeutic siRNAs were successfully used against hepatitis in a mouse model [14] , followed by large-scale screening in mammalian and human cells [15, 16] .

Both of them share a common RNase III-processing enzyme, Dicer, and closely related effector complexes, RISCs, for post-transcriptional repression [42] . Dicer cuts long dsRNA into siRNAs and chops short precursor miRNAs with imperfect stem-loop structure to miRNAs [43] . Gene silencing can be induced by siRNA through sequence-specific cleavage of perfectly complementary mRNA, whereas miRNAs mediate translational repression and transcript degradation for imperfectly complementary targets. The miRNA pathway begins with the transcription of a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) from a miRNA gene. The 70-100-nt hairpin RNAs (pri-miRNA) are processed in the nucleus by the ribonuclease Drosha to become precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Once the pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm by exportin 5, a second ribonuclease, Dicer, digests the pre-miRNAs resulting in a 21-25-nt miRNA.

Each of these levels of targeting poses a significant barrier. Several strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers, such as chemical modifications of siRNA, viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems.

Direct injection into the vitreal cavity efficiently targets siRNA drugs to the retina. Also, since the ocular compartment is relatively free of nucleases, it permits the unmodified siRNA to be used in the vitreal cavity.The ease of drug delivery combined with the validation of VEGF as a therapeutic target has led to the rapid development of several RNAi therapeutics for eye diseases.
