All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent ultrasound, Voiding cystourethrography, Dimercapto-succinic acid scan. A follow-up scan was performed 6 months later for diagnosis of scar. Age, gender, organism, presence and grade of vesicoureteric reflux(VUR), delay in treatment, total white blood cell counts(WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and CRP(C-reactive protein) levels on admission were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between study variables and scar formation. Results: Of 103 patients enrolled 47.6% (n=49) had VUR. Renal scarwas detectedin 38.8% (n=40).There were significant associations between delay in treatment (p=0.0001), grade of VUR (p=0.03) and elevated levels of ESR (p= 0.006), CRP (p=0.002) and WBC (p=0.005) with scar. No association with age, sex, presence of VUR, organism was established. In multivariate analysis, delay in treatment was independently associated with scar formation. Conclusion: We found grade of VUR, delay in treatment and increased level of ESR, CRP and WBC are important risk factors of scar. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of genetic, host defense mechanisms and immunologic factors.",

Methods: 27 white male rats (20 weeks of age old) with induced urethral stenosis were infected with E. coli via the urethra. The observation period was 6 months. Rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 st group(n=15): treatment with cefotaxime (0.25 mg intramuscularly for 5 days 48 to 72 hours after the first signs of pyelonephritis) and enalapril (0.1 mg/kg/day body during 6 months); 2 nd group (n=9)treatment with antibiotics alone; 3 rd group (n=3): controls. Kidneys were examined histologically and urinary excretion of TGF-\u03b21 was determined by ELISA. Results: In spite of antibacterial treatment and eradicated bacterial infection the inflammatory interstitial lesions, characterized by secondary tubular and vascular damage and edema persisted in the experimental rats. Inflammatory infiltrations by polymorphonuclear cells of varying degree were found in both experimental groups. At 6 months the fibrotic changes with collagen formation and interstitial infiltration of the renal parenchyma were more pronounced in group 2 than in group 1. Urinary levels of TGF-\u03b21 in group 1 were higher as compared to controls (p<0.05), but lower than in group 2 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Pyelonephritis leads to interstitial inflammation and sclerosis in renal cortical and medullary tissue and to the development of reflux-nephropathy. Additional treatment with enalapril lowered both urinary TGF-\u03b21 and angiotensin II, resulting in less vascular edema formation and less hyperemia and therefore in diminished formation of new scars. However, the extent of interstitial fibrosis remained unchanged despite lower urinary TGF-\u03b21.",

Methods: We reviewed prospectively 183 pediatric patients with symptomatic UTI admitted to emergency department or referred to nephrology clinic from November 2002 through July 2005. All patients underwent renal ultrasonography and voidingcystouretherography or radionuclide cystography. Diuretic renal scan or intravenous pyelography (IVP) was performed in those with urinary system dilatation. Urodynamic studies were done in patients with normal radiologic findings and recurrent infections or urinaryintestinal symptoms. Results: Of 183 patients, 130 cases (71%) were female and 53 patients (29%) male. Most of the patients (61.9%) were between 2-24 months old (P=0.001). Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was the most common predisposing factor in both genders (46.9% in girls and 48.9% in boys). Voiding dysfunction in girls and urinary obstruction in boys Pediatr Nephrol (were found with a significant difference (P=0.03 for both). In all age groups, except patients' month, the most common predisposing factor was reflux. Reflux, urinary obstruction and nephrolithiasis were found with a significant difference in 2-24 months age group (P=0.001 for all). Conclusion: In our study vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was as common in boys as in girls, and suggested urolithiasis as a significant UTI predisposing factor. This study showed that voiding dysfunction in girls and urinary obstruction in boys are as significant predisposing factors. We suggest urodynamic studies in patients with normal radiologic findings and recurrent infections or urinary-intestinal symptoms.",

Those diagnosed prenatally are given prophylactic antibiotics after birth to reduce such risk until the severity of the duplication is investigated. To assess the incidence of urinary tract infection and clinical outcome of infants with antenatally diagnosed duplex kidneys. Method: Retrospective study of 39 patients identified antenatally with a duplex kidney in a single centre between 2007 and 2011. Clinical outcome and comorbidity of UTI was ascertained from local databases and clinical note review in postnatally confirmed duplex cases. Results: During a 5 year period, 39 patients with antenatally suspected duplex kidneys were identified, 31 of which were confirmed postnatally (79%). Urinary tract infection was found in 48% (n=15) despite all receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Of the 15 cases with UTI, 87% (n=13) required further surgical intervention. Conclusion: Infants with antenatally detected duplex kidneys remain at increased risk of developing urinary tract infection despite early antibiotic prophylaxis. Those with urinary tract infection are likely to require surgical intervention. Prenatal diagnosis allows the opportunity to counsel parents about the risk of UTI and likely need for further intervention compared those presenting clinically.

Methods: Medical records of pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years old with diagnosis of urinary tract infection were reviewed. Demographic data, urinalysis and urine culture results and kidney and urinary bladder(KUB) ultrasound findings were tabulated and analyzed using the 95% confidence interval. Relative risks were computed with a level of significance of p value < 0.05. Results: A total of 803 patients were included in the study. Five hundred forty-four(67.8%) belongs to age group < 5 years old. Majority were females with a 0.97:1 male to female ratio. Escherichia coli is the most common organism isolated. Patients with post void urine bladder residual are at risk for having growth in the urine culture. In sub group analysis for age and sex, statistically significant results were noted among patients belonging to the 3-5 years with the RR of 1.337, 95% CI (1.082, 1.651) p-value of 0.003 and males with RR 1.186 (95% CI 1.024, 1.374) p value 0.0168. Conclusion: There is an association between the occurrence of urinary tract infection and the presence of post void bladder volume residual. Males and those patients aged 3 to 5 years of age are more at risk for urinary infection. Objective: To evaluate if a relationship exists between renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) findings among children with UTI and determine whether the renal ultrasound findings/results can serve as a guide if a procedure such as VCUG is needed to be done in the patient. Methods: Medical records of infants and children diagnosed as having UTI who underwent renal ultrasound and VCUG were reviewed. Demographic data, urine culture and results of imaging studies were tabulated and analyzed. Kappa statistics was used to determine the agreement between renal ultrasound and VCUG results. McNemars test was utilized to determine the statistical significance of the agreement. Level of significance was place at p value of < 0.05. Results: A total of 146 patients were included in the study. Thirtyeight(26%) had vesicoureteral reflux. There were more females with a male to female ratio of 1:1.3 while cases with reflux had a 1:1.5 male to female ratio. Most common chief complaint was fever. E. coli is the most commonly isolated etiologic organism from the urine. Twenty(52.7%) patients had primary VUR while 18(47.3%) were secondary. Fifty two of 146 children had abnormal sonogram; of duplex collecting system (DCS) diagnosed during postnatal USC on Objective: The aim was to evaluate the relationship of laboratory investigations, therapeutic delay time (TDT), and therapeutic response time (TRT) with acute renal damage and to verify these parameters in the presence of non refluxing and refluxing urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods: A prospective study was conducted in 67 children. All patients received voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. Statistical analyses were applied to assess all parameters with DMSA renal scintigraphy. Results: Abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy was detected in 20/67 (29.9%) patients. There were no significant differences in peak temperature, TDT and treatment duration. However, white blood cells (WBC) count, percentage of serum polymorphonuclear cells (%PMN) and TRT had significant differences at p-values 0.042, <0.001 and 0.001, respectively. The area under ROC curve for WBC count, %PMN and TRT was 0.653 (95%CI 0.509-0.798) at p-values 0.055, 0.799 (95%CI 0.681-0.888) at p-values <0.001 and 0.760 (95%CI 0.637-0.858) at p-value 0.001, respectively. Overall, the optimal cutoff value for %PMN was 56.0 with sensitivity 84.2% (60. 4-96.4 ) and specificity 60. 9% (45.4-74.9 ). The optimal cut-off value for TRT was 22 hours with sensitivity 80.0% (56.3-94.1) and specificity 63. 6% (47.8-77.6) . In 50 patients with no vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), there was significant difference in TRT at p-values 0.002. The area under ROC curve for TRT was 0.824 (95%CI 0.693-0.955) at p-value 0.004. The optimal cut-off value for TRT was 25 hours with sensitivity 88.9 % (95%CI 51.7-98.2) and specificity 68.4% . In VUR patients, there were no significant differences in TDT, %PMN and TRT between normal and abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy at p-value 0.750, 0.191 and 0.313, respectively. Conclusion: %PMN \u226556% and TRT \u226522 hours predict renal damage in the first episode of UTI. However, in patients with no VUR, TRT \u226525 hours predict renal damage. DMSA renal scintigraphy in the first episode of UTI should be considered in those patients. susceptibility data. Knowledge of local antimicrobial susceptibility all children with the first episode of febrile urinary tract infection traditionally. Nowadays it has been revealed that the presence of renal scar is more important than the presence of VUR regarding renal and patient outcome. Our aim was to assess the relationship between the severity of VUR and the severity of DMSA scan changes which is performed in the first week of the first febrile UTI. Methods: Children with the first febrile UTI who were admitted in Ali asghar children hospital were evaluated prospectively. All DMSA scans have been observed and graded by our nuclear medicine specialist without any knowledge of presence or absence of VUR. Renal damages in DMSA scan were classified to 8 grades as follows: Grade 0: normal kidney, grade 1: decreased uptake in one pole with intact border, grade 2: decreased uptake in two poles with intact borders, grade 3: diffuse decreased uptake with intact border, grade 4: decreased uptake in one pole with scar, grade 5: decreased uptake in two poles with scar, grade 6: multiple scars, grade 7: diffuse decreased uptake with one pole scar, grade 8: diffuse decreased uptake with multiple scars. Then DMSA findings in patients with no VUR, with low grade VUR and high grade or dilating VUR were compared with each other. Results and Conclusion: One hundred and six patients with the first febrile UTI were included in this study, thus 212 kidneys were evaluated for the presence or absence of VUR and DMSA grading. The mean age of our patients was 4\u00b12.9 years old. 12.3% of our patients were male. 44.8% of kidneys did not have any VUR, low grade VUR (grades 1,2,3) was seen in 34.4% of kidneys and high grade VUR 9grades 4, 5) was found in 20.3% of kidneys. 76.2% of patients with low grade VUR and/or without VUR had DMSA scoring.",

Severity of VUR was classified as mild (grade I, II), moderate (grade II, III) and severe (grade V) Results: Of the 218 children screened for primary VUR, 107 with complete data were included for analysis. The mean age was 25.68 \u00b122.45 months with male to female ratio of 1.4:1. The age at presentation was significantly lower for moderate to severe VUR as compared to mild VUR (p=0.033). Thirty children (28%) had abnormal antenatal scans. Majorities (80%) of children were diagnosed to have VUR during evaluation for urinary tract infection.Among107 patients, six had solitary kidneys and thus the total number of systems evaluated was 208.

The children of the Swedish Reflux Trial constitute a high risk group with dilating VUR, recurrent febrile UTI and high prevalence of renal parenchymal defects. We have searched the growth pattern of these children for differences related to gender, treatment group, UTI recurrence, VUR grade at follow up or renal defects on DMSA. Methods: Height and weight Z-scores, compared to standardized Swedish growth charts, were registered during the 2 year follow up in 199 of the children in the trial and at outpatient visits thereafter in 129 patients to the age of 5.3 years (median, range 2.0-11.8). Change in height Z-score between first and last visit was used to measure growth over time.",

There were no differences in growth related to gender, treatment group, VUR-grade at follow up or recurrent UTI. Conclusion: The children of the Swedish Reflux Trial constitute a high risk group with dilating VUR, recurrent febrile UTI and high prevalence of renal parenchymal defects. They have normal weight, height and height gain at follow up for up to 10 years. There was no sign of growth inhibition in these children related to dilating VUR. The larger height gain seen in those with renal defects seem to be due to their slightly shorter stature at study start, although within normal range, which could be related to more severe urinary tract and renal problems during their first 1-2 years of life.",

Patients with low-grade (I-II) VUR and those who showed normal DMSA findings were included into the study. Initially, a DMSA scintigraphy was performed in all patients and those who experienced acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) during the follow-up period. Treatment success was defined as complete VUR resolution. No patients were prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis. All parents were informed by being given an explanation of the clinical significance of personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating. Our Institutional Review Board approved to collect the data, retrospectively. Statistical analysis was made by using IBM SPSS 20.0 software. Results: The study sample comprised 21 infants (10 boys and 11 girls) all of whom showed low-grade reflux (grades I-II). Bilateral reflux was seen in 7 (33.3 %) of cases. Median age at diagnosis was 8 months (range: 1-37 months). Median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 9-28 months). The spontaneousresolution rate of reflux was 89.3 % (25 out of 28 renal units). The frequency of febrile UTI was 0.74\u00b10.7 episode/year (median: 0.8 episode/year). During the follow-up no patients with febrile UTI experienced scar on DMSA scintigraphy. Conclusion: Infants with low-grade reflux show a low risk of febrile UTI and a high spontaneous resolution rate without antibiotic prophylaxis. Therefore, these children should be managed primarily by conservative therapy.",

Methods: Children aged\u2264 2 years old with a first febrile UTI were prospectively evaluated. Serum samples were tested for PCT measurements upon admission to a tertiary hospital. All children underwent renal ultrasonography (US), 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan, and voiding cystourethrography. The diagnostic characteristics of PCT test for acute pyelonephritis (APN) and dilating VUR were calculated. Results: Of 272 children analyzed (168 boys and 104 girls; median age, 5 months), 169 (62.1%) had APN. There was VUR in 97 (35.7%), including 70 (25.7%) with dilating VUR. The median PCT value was significantly higher in children with VUR than in those without (P< 0.001). Using a PCT cutoff value of \u22651.0ng/mL, the sensitivity and negative predictive value for predicting dilating VUR were 94.3% and 95.4%, respectively, for PCT, and 97.1% and 97.8%, respectively, for the combined PCT and US studies, whereas the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.03 and 0.107, respectively, for PCT, and 1.72 and 0.067, respectively, for the combined studies. By multivariate analysis, high PCT values and abnormalities on US were independent predictors of dilating VUR. Conclusion: PCT is useful for diagnosing APN and predicting dilating VUR in young children with a first febrile UTI. A voiding cystourethrography is indicated only in children with high PCT values (\u22651.0 ng/mL) and/or abnormalities found on a US. Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of acute 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in predicting dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among young children with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods: The medical records of children (age\u22642 years), presenting with febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2011, were retrospectively reviewed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio of acute DMSA scan in predicting dilating VUR in young children with febrile UTI were calculated. Results: A total of 523 children were included, of which 397(75.9%) had abnormal DMSA results and 178(34.0%) were identified as VUR on micturatingcystourethrography (MCU). Among all the patients, the number of dilating VUR was 151(28.9%). The rate of abnormal results on DMSA of dilating VUR group was significantly higher than the rates of non-VUR and low-grade VUR groups (P<0.01). In age<6 months group and age\u22656 months group, the sensitivities of DMSA in predicting dilating VUR were 96.15%, 100.0% respectively, while the negative predictive value were 97.26%, 100.0% and negative likelihood ratio were 0.0911,0.0000, respectively. Conclusion: For children of age\u22642 years with febrile UTI, acute DMSA scan possesses certain values in excluding dilating VUR. The possibility to detect dilating VUR by MCU is rather low when the result of DMSA is negative.",

Methods: 111 neurologically normal children with chief complaint of enuresis enrolled in the study including 60 boys and 51 girls, aged 5-17 years old, 43 (38.8%) with MNE and 68 (61.2%) with NMNE. Urine analysis, urine culture and kidney bladder ultra sonography was done for all .Some patients underwent voiding cystoureterography (VCUG), urodynamic study (UDS), or both. Results: Patients were divided in to 3 groups: MNE, NMNE daytime incontinence and NMNE +daytime incontinence. Constipation, encopresis and urge incontinence were significantly more frequent in patients with NMNE +daytime incontinence (P= 0.011, 0.003, 0.001 respectively) . Bladder wall thickness was the most common US findings..One patient with MNE and 9 with NMNE+ daytime incontinence had vesico -ureteral reflux(VUR) )(P=0.016).Posterior urethral valve was reported in one patient with NMNE. Evidences of bladder dysfunction were noted in about half of the patients who underwent UDS, with higher prevalence in cases with NMNE + daytime urinary incontinence(P=0.297). Bowel symptoms and VUR were significantly more prevalent in cases with NMNE +daytime incontinence. Conclusion: We recommend doing VCUG in enuretic children who have daytime incontinence.In addition our study revealed that symptoms suggestive of over active bladder are not good indicators for bladder dysfunction.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of the application of questionnaires to detect ADHD and other psychiatric disorders in children with functional voiding disorders in general pediatrics consultations Methods: The study was conducted on 32 children between 6 and 13 years of age (20 males) diagnosed with FVD (patient group) and 32 children of the same age (21 males) who had no urinary symptoms (control group). The parents of these children responded to the questions in two standardized questionnaires: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to screen for mental health disorders and the Questionnaire for the detection of ADHD of the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders of American Academy of Psychiatry manual. The variables obtained from the questionnaire responses were compared between the two groups of children using the Student's t-test for unpaired samples when variables were quantitative and the chi-square test if the variables were qualitative. It was considered significant when p<0.05 Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups in the SDQ questionnaire in any of its sections (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems and prosocial behavior) or global assessment test, in which only 2 patients of each group had an abnormal result. The questionnaire for the detection of ADHD, presented an altered overall result of 17.18% and 14.06% patients in the control group (p=ns). There were also no differences between the two groups on the results of this test concerning the inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity sections. Conclusion: The results of the application of questionnaires to detect ADHD and other psychiatric disorders in children with FVD are similar to those of the general population.

ADHD is diagnosed in 3~5 % of children. Children with ADHD seem to suffer from various forms of urinary problems such as nocturnal enuresis, dysfunctional voiding and diurnal incontinence. However, no data exist to confirm in Korean ADHD children. We investigate the clinical findings of voiding dysfunction in ADHD children. Methods: Between October 2009 and March 2011, a total of 63 children (33 children with ADHD and the other 30 children with upper respiratory infection as control group) were enrolled in Gangnam Sacred Heart hospital, Hallymuniversity. ADHD children were diagnosed under diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM)-IV criteria. A comprehensive survey of voiding and defecating were administered.

This study investigated psychological correlates of enuresis in a group of children suffering primary nocturnal enuresis(PNE). Methods: This survey involved 98 parents and their children with PNE aged 7-14 years. Clinical datas of enuresis were collected through parents' reports and individual administrations to all children. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist. Children completed Piers Harris Children'sSelf concept Scale, the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED)and Depression Self Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) . Results: Of the 98 children, 60 are boys and 38 are girls. 65 are monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis and, 33 are nonmonosymptomatic. 72 children accord with the severest form of bedwetting(>=7 times/week). 64.3%(n=63)children have behaviour problems and, girls get higher scores in withdraw and internalizing problems than boys. Boys are more aggressive. 42.9%(n=42) get positive results through SCARED. 9.2%(n=9) get positive results in DSRSC. Children with the severest form of bedwetting are likely to have more complex form of psychological problems. They have greater social problems, get higher scores in behaviour problem (P=0.026) and lower scores in Piers Harris Children's Self concept Scale (P=0.034). But children with or without the severest form of bedwetting have no significant difference in SCARED . MNE have no significant difference with NMNE in scores of all the three children's self-evaluated scales. Conclusion: Most children with PNE had different psychological problems. The severer the symptoms are, the more complex the psychological correlates are. These preliminary findings support the view of enuresis closely related with psychological problems. Psychological problems are affected by many factors except for enuresis, so further researches need to be conducted to determine whether there is a causal relationship between psychopathology and enuresis.",

The information of previous clinical experience, compliance and expected treatment goals are collected and analyzed. Results: 623 children, with the mean age of 8.69\u00b12.33 are enrolled. 449 children have visited doctors before, 295 have unsatisfied clinical experience, such as late intervention, less standardized treatment and over-treatment. 64.36% have poor compliance with doctor's suggestion of behaviour therapy and alarm therapy. 262 children have been suggested to take medicines such as Chinese traditional medicine DDAVP, but 17.8% of them refused the suggestion anxious of the side effects or stop the usage on their own. The primary expected treatment goal of parents is to improve the symptoms, accounting for 86.04%. Excluding the underlying diseases, Alleviating parents' burden, treating the symptoms of hyperactivity or inattention and avoiding adverse effects on intellectual and fertility are also included. For children, they'd like to improve the symptoms so they won't be published by parents or laughed by their fellows. Most parents (79.94%) preferred medicines as the first choice. 12.40% parents and children are inconsistent with the behavior therapy (the rate of Newly diagnosed and non newly diagnosed children were 8.04%, 14.03% respectly. \u03c7 2 test P>0.05). 38 (6.10%) don't accept alarm therapy (the rate of Newly diagnosed and non newly diagnosed children were 2.30%, 8.02% respectly. \u03c7 2 test P>0.05). Conclusion: Children with primary enuresis need early intervention and standardized treatment. The effect of treatment largely depends on cooperation and joint participation of children and parents. This study found that the compliance of behaviour training and alarm therapy is lower than medicine.

Although a degree of association is evident, MVV does not always reflect the nocturnal bladder reservoir function in MNE. We aimed to evaluate the nocturnal bladder reservoir function during the night in children with apparently normal MVV. Methods: Data from 557 children aged 5-15 treated for MNE in a tertiary referral centre was analyzed. Data from 135 children was excluded due to reduced MVV according to ICCS standardization and 156 due to lack of home recordings. The remaining were divided into two groups, based on whether MVV was above (n=91) or below (n=175) the average nocturnal urine production during wet nights (NUPw) . First morning voids were not included in MVV values. Results: 34 % of the children with MNE and a normal bladder capacity had an average nocturnal urine production during wet nights below their MVV, one third of these had NUPw below 65 % of MVV expected for age. These children did not differ significantly in terms of demographic characteristics, frequency of wet nights or treatment time needed to achieve dryness. Urine output during dry nights was not statistical significant between the groups (p=0.077, mean diff.=28.47 ml). The group with MVV>NUPwet shared significantly higher MVV to MVV expected for age ratios (mean diff=0.16, p<0.05). Urine output during wet nights was lower in the group of children with MVV>NUPw (diff: 96.45 ml, p<0.05) . Conclusion: Children with MNE and apparently normal bladder reservoir function during daytime may experience wet nights with urine volumes well below their MVV and MVV expected for age. The fact indicates bladder reservoir function abnormalities during sleep that is not assessed by day recordings. Physicians treating children with MNE should consider anticholinergic treatment.",

Chronic clinical conditions and genetic disorders constituted exclusion criteria. Methods: After IRB approval, families were invited to participate in the project through press releases, 130 children completed quality of life evaluation through clinically validated questionnaires, followed by a one -day multidisciplinary clinical evaluation. Sleep, urinary and intestinal diaries were evaluated. Urinary sonography, nocturnal polysomnography, urinary and blood analysis were scheduled. Results: 96/130 participants (pts)were male (73,8%), mean age 8 \u00b11 yrs. Twenty two children were excluded due to noncompliance /chronic clinical conditions. 118/130 pts were evaluated. 93/130 parents of children/adolescents, answered the CBCL questionnaire, 25/93 (27%) of which resulted in scores compatible with clinical psychological conditions. Monosymptomatic enuresis (MoE) was diagnosed in 89/118 children (75.4%). In the MoE group, 67/89 pts were diagnosed with intestinal constipation; 7/89 pts with obstructive sleep apnea, 2/89 pts with hipercalciuria and 2/89 were characterized with ADHD. Area and velocity of center or pressure displacement (VM) were used for postural control evaluation and resulted in 3,67 \u00b12,95 cm 2 and 20,35\u00b113,04 cm.s-1, respectively; 22/89 pts were also assessed for postural alignment exhibiting pelvic anteversion (10,27 \u00b13,71 grades) and head protusion (0,40\u00b11,86 grades). These results corroborate with a smaller range of motion found for hip flexion (94,86\u00b117,14 grades) and hip extension (2\u00b13,89 grades) assessed using a goniometer.

            "text": "Recently, a smaller variation in plasma concentration was shown for the oral lyophilisate formulation of desmopressin (compared to tablet formulation). Therefore, this study assessed a possible correlation between weight-corrected dose and plasma concentration for both formulations. Methods: 23 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were recruited in a tertiary centre. Two tests were performed on two separate days (at two weeks interval) in identical, standardized conditions: on day 1 desmopressin tablet 200\u03bcg and on day 2 desmopressin oral lyophilisate 120\u03bcg was administered. Plasma concentrations were measured at one, two and six hours post dosing. The nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for assessing the correlation between weight corrected dose and plasma concentration. Results: Mean (SD) age and body weight of the patients were respectively 12.7 (2.9) years and 50.1 (15. 2) kg. A positive correlation between plasma concentration of dDAVP was found for the oral lyophilisate formulation at 2 hours (P-value 0,021) and 6 hours (Pvalue 0,005) post dosing. This is not the case for the tablet formulation. Results are shown graphically in figure 1 and 2. Figure 1 and 2: correlation of dose corrected by weight to plasma concentrations at 2 and 6 hours post dosing Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacokinetic study showing a significant dose (normalized for size) -concentration correlation for desmopressin. Nevertheless, this correlation was only significant for the oral lyophilisate group. This result is clinically important as it is a strong indication for more predictable plasma concentrations for the oral lyophilisate formulation, and thus preventing elevated concentrations of desmopressin. Objective: Increased nocturnal urine production and/or bladder hyperactivity in primary nocturnal enuretic (NE) patients could possibly be associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Reports of studies on autonomic nervous system dysfunction in NE are limited. To investigate autonomic nervous system function in enuretic children by performing ambulatory blood pressure monitorisation (ABPM) for 24 hours. Methods: Children with primary NE were enrolled in this study and they get 24 hour ABPM. Their results were compared with healthy children. Urinalysis,urine electrolyte levels, urinary culture and urinary system ultrasound were carried out in all the children. They also requested to have a diary about daily fluid intake and volume of daily urine. Results: The enuretic group consisted of 28 children (M/F:19/9) and the control group of 27 healthy children (M/F:14/13). The mean ages were 7.9\u00b12.2 years and 8.77\u00b12.65 years, respectively. The mean 24-hour BP and daytime DBP did not differ between the groups however, the mean systolic BP was significantly higher in enuretic children (p<0.05). The mean nighttime systolic BP, DBP and MAP were significantly higher as well in the patient group. Daytime BP load did not found to be elevated in both groups.Elevated night time systolic BP load was observed in 4 patients and was not observed in control group (14.2 % vs 0%) (p<0.01). Nighttime diastolic BP load was elevated in 7 of 28 patients, compared with 1 of 27 control subjects (p<0.01). The nocturnal BP dip was significantly reduced in the patient group compared with control group for diastolic blood pressure ( 67.8 % vs 14.7 %, respectively; p=0.037). Patients with elevated night time BP load was found to have higher frequency of urinary incontinence per week as well as per night while compared with enuretic children with normal night time BP load (r=0.72, p<0.01; r=0.69, p<0.01 respectively). Conclusion: Nocturnal BP loads were significantly higher in children with enuresis. These subtle abnormalities of circadian blood pressure regulation, loss of nocturnal dip and observation of decreased nocturnal pulse rate may reflect autonomic nervous system dysfunction and pathogenesis of EN.",

            "text": "Objective: Bladder dysfunction and especially OAB plays a major role in nocturnal enuresis, not only in the non monosymptomatic (NMNE) but as well in the monosymptomatic patients (MNE) . If the enuresis is related to a mismatch in nocturnal diuresis and maximal functional bladder capacity, then the bladder volume should be a major parameter, but is sofar not taken as a parameter for subtyping into NMNE in the ICCS standardization. Maximal voided volume in a diary is the golden standard, although relation with outcome is poorly studied. Methods: Aim of the study was to evaluate the optimal parameter for estimation of bladder volume as maximal voided volume in a diary, during forced diuresis, bladder volume during 3 uroflow + uroflow), correlating with cystomanometry (if indicated). Studypopulation 398 patients age 5 to 18 years, >6/7days wet, only 48 cystomanometries. Results: If we compare the data from the bladder volume against the reference frame from Rittig (Aarhus), then 60,4% of patients had a MVV in diary < 2,5% percentile demonstrating that a majority of patients had a small for age voided volume in their diary. Correlation between MVVdiary, MVV forced diuresis, bladder capacity (uroflow+ residu) and cystomanometry show that there is a strong correlation between the 4, But especially for the last 3 parameters (r 2 0.48-0.62, p <0.01),but results with MVV diary are worse (r 2 0.34-0.48, p 0.04-0.018) . There is no sex or gender difference in this observation. Correlation with response to therapy at 1 year shows a superior correlation with MVV forced diuresis and during uroflow than MVV diary (p0.04). Since cystomanometry is only performed in refractory cases, this voided value had no correlation with clinical outcome. Conclusion: Bladder volume can be estimated in several ways, each with their advantages and pitfalls. Our data demonstrate that the alternative non invasive methods during force diuresis and in center during 3 uroflow correlate best to each other and to the cystomanometricvalues. But as well to the one year outcome (p 0.04).",

Where the sum of diaper weight and morning voided volume, is the standard to evaluate nocturnal diuresis (polyuria), it does not give indices about pathophysiology. The Aarhus concept : in center studies during standardised intake, offers the advantage of standardized conditions, and reliability of the values, but is restricted to specific research centres in limited patients for budgetary reasons). The Ghent concept : A home based 24 hours concentration prophyle with 4 time daytime and 4 nighttime collections offers an alternative. This one day test was not validated against 14 days diuresis nighttime registration, and was criticized since waking up the patient overnight might increase diuresis and solute excretion, as is demonstrated in sleep deprivation Aim of the study: to validate nocturnal diuresis and solution excretion to evaluate nocturnal polyuria against 14 days nighttime diary and 2 days daytime diary. Methods: To the study the incidence of nocturnal polyuria, and to evaluate the value of the morning osmolality in the study of nocturnal polyuria.

Fifty-one (64 %) children achieved the targeted 21 consecutive dry nights. In the remaining 28 children, the main reasons for treatment failure were non adherence to usage of enuresis alarms mainly due to an inability to wake up to the alarm in deep sleep (71%) and underlying neurobehavioural conditions (21%) (ADHD, autism, depression and a chromosomal disorder). The only significant clinical factor predicting treatment failure was the presence of an underlying neurobehavioural condition (OR 2.8, and developmental delay .

This study aims to investigate the prevalence of nocturia and other urinary symptoms in patients who have suffered from NE. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 1265 patients treated more than 3 years ago in the University Hospital of Ghent for NE evaluating the history and current status of enuresis and validated questionnaires on urinary incontinence (ICIQ-UI) and overactive bladder symptoms (ICIQ-OAB). Medical files of all subjects were analysed on the history of enuresis. All subjects were asked to sign an informed consent. Results: Of the 516 (41%) subjects who completed the questionnaire, 183 reported nocturia (36%), with a sex ratio (M/F) of 101/81 in the nocturic group versus 230/103 in the non-nocturic group, mean age is 18 versus 17 years old, respectively. Comparing the nocturic and nonnocturic group, retrospective analysis of the history of enuresis shows an older age at which the subjects were cured (10 vs 9.5, respectively) and a higher percentage of non-monosymptomatic NE (74% vs 63%, respectively) in the nocturic group. No differences in past treatment for NE were found between both groups. Prospective analysis shows a significantly higher prevalence (p<0.001) of voiding frequency during daytime, urge and urinary incontinence in nocturics compared to nonnocturics. With an increase in number of nocturic episodes per night, the percentage of female subjects increases (p<0.001) and the percentage of subjects with non-monosymptomatic NE increases as well (p<0.011). Conclusion: Over one out of 3 former enuretic patients develops nocturia, often accompanied by other urinary symptoms and with significant bother. Cure of nocturnal enuresis does not necessarily equals cure of the urological pathology and some of the nocturic patients, who remain to suffer from bothersome symptoms, might benefit from continuous treatment for the underlying urological condition, such as overactive bladder syndrome or nocturnal polyuria.",

When she wanted to urinate, she was writhing in pain; she cried, became pale and sweated. Since the newborn period parents have observed sudden episodes when the girl started to cry and curled up her legs. She stopped when she began to urinate. The girl's father occasionally had pains in the jaw between yawning. The girl's voiding was like parents described: when she was trying to begin urinating, she was squatting on the toilet seat, crying and became pale and sweated. When voiding occurred the girl seemed to relax. The voiding volume was small and the urinary stream was weak. All investigations results were normal. According to the clinical course we assumed that the girl had an unusual expression of Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of the heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the SCN9A gene, a missense mutation in exon 5. The same mutation was also confirmed in her father. The girl was started on carbamazepine and the pain attacks almost disappeared. PEPD is a rare autosomal dominant neuropathy linked to mutation in the SCN9A gene which encodes voltage-gated sodium channels. Abnormal pain sensitivity occurs due to changes in the properties of the channels. PEPD's onset is in the neonatal period with the most characteristic clinical features being attacks of excruciating pain in the rectum, genitalia, face and limbs. In literature we did not find any citation of patients with attacks triggered by the voiding stimulus. Carbamazepine has been effective in relieving symptoms but the response is often incomplete (1) (2) (3) , as in our patient. Conclusion: The case described is interesting because of the rare clinical expression of PEPD with pain triggered by voiding. The same mutation was recently found in patients with SFN (4) . The study of functional importance of this mutation showed that the result of the mutation is increased frequency of firing pain-signaling neurons (5) .",

Methods: A randomly selected cross-sectional study was conducted in four elementary schools in two districts inShanghai. The parents of these children were asked to complete questionnaires anonymously which included items about the presence and frequency of enuresis, its risk factors and its perceived impact and management. The distress caused to the family by enuresis and the outcome of any management was evaluated using a 5-point visual analogue scale (VAS). PNS was defined as an involuntary voiding of urine during sleep, with a frequency of more than two times a week for three consecutive months, in the absence of congenital or acquired defects of the central nervous system. Results: A total of 7600 questionnaires were distributed. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 97.1%, girls 45.2% and boys 51.8%. The prevalence of PNE declined with age from 6.3% at 7 years old to 0.5% at 11 years old. Of all enuresis children, 10.1% had daytime urinary symptoms and 11.7% had a positive family history. 58.8% of parents were concerned and 17.6% were very concerned about enuresis. 41.2% of children were worried about and 5.9% were very worried about enuresis. Only 35.3% of PNE children sought for treatment and the common strategies (23.5%) were adjusting lifestyle such as restriction of water intake at night, 11.9% used alarm clock and 5.8% were take medication. 48.6% of parents felt that the current treatment was effective. Conclusion: We conducted a relatively scientific epidemiological survey on the prevalence of PNE in two districts in Shanghai. We find enuresis still has great impact on children and their parents, but only a small part of them will seek for treatment. And only half of the parents feel that the current treatment is effective. Therefore, it would be desirable to create a series of standardized management and follow-up processes for enuresis children.",

Methods: Data of children with TSC who presented to Christian Medical College Vellore Hospital from January 2008 onwards, were analysed by a retrospective chart review. The cases were identified from outpatient records and underwent ultrasonography, urine analysis and serum creatinine to recognize renal involvement. Results: Twenty-five children with TSC were identified. Two children did not imaging studies available and were excluded from the analysis. The age of included children ranged from 5 days to 15 years with a median of 8 years. Seventy four percent (17/23) were males. Ten of the 23 children had evidence of renal involvement (43.5%). Of the ten children with renal involvement, six had angiomyolipoma (60%), five had renal cysts (50%) and one had suspected renal cell carcinoma. In two children both angiomyolipoma (AML) and cysts were noted. None were symptomatic. One child was found to have proteinuria and another had reduced creatinine clearance of 52.5 ml/min/m 2 with normal BP and urinalysis. The rest of children had no evidence of proteinuria and had normal creatinine clearance. Conclusion: We conclude that all children with TSC should be screened for renal involvement and regular follow up should be arranged. ",

Results and Conclusion: There was a good correlation between kidney length and somatic values including age, weight, and height. The rapid growth of height during the first 2 years of life was intimately associated with a similar increase in kidney length. The values of weight and height showed good correlation with kidney length in children from 2 to 12 years of age. Height should be considered the important factor to correlate with kidney length. For the children aged 2 years or older, the regression equation was obtained: kidney length (cm) = 2.677 + 0.046 x height (cm). For the younger than 2 years, the equation was: kidney length (cm) = 1.120 + 0.066 x height (cm).",

We report two children in renal failure since birth due to congenital cystic dysplastic kidneys. Hepatoblastoma was subsequently diagnosed in both of them. Methods and Results: Case1 A male infant was born at 35 weeks gestation with an antenatal diagnosis of bilateral dysplastic kidneys and bladder outflow obstruction secondary to a prolapsing ureterocele, anhydramnios, and pulmonary hypoplasia. He underwent surgical repair of other congeniatal abnormality after birth. Peritoneal dialysis was initiated at 3 months. Treatment with Erythropoietin (EPO) was commenced at 6 weeks of age. Case 2 A male infant with congenital cystic renal dysplasia, bilateral vesicoureteric reflux pulmonary hypoplasia and oligohydramnios was born at 36 weeks gestation. Peritoneal dialysis was commenced at day 20 due to anuria from birth. EPO was commenced at 6 months of age. Both of them required high dose EPO to maintain adequate haemoglobin. Hepatoblastoma was diagnosed in both of them at 2-3 years, following an incidental finding in abdominal imaging done for different reasons.",

None of these children had evidence of impaired renal function prior to the diagnosis of hepatoblastoma. In our report both the child were treated with high dose erythropoietin prior to diagnosis of hepatoblastoma. Erythropoietin (Epo) is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis through specific interaction with its receptor (Epo R). EpoR expression has been demonstrated in common paediatrictumour cells and such expression is reported to promote tumour cell survival through release of angiogenic growth factors. Angiogenesis is the primary requirement for tumour growth. Epo production has been observed in patients with hepatomas and in the HepG-2 cell line in hepatoblastoma. We report two cases of hepatoblastoma detected incidentally in children with established renal failure and propose a putative role of EPO in the development and / or progression of hepatoblastoma in this population.

Results: A total of 158 renal biopsies were performed in 141 patients (82 boys, 59 girls). The mean age at first procedure was 9.4 years. About 70 % of the indications for a biopsy showed moderate proteinuria and hematuria in the annual urinary screening program in Japan, and approximately 20 percent of those were refractory childhood nephrotic syndrome. Open renal biopsies were practiced in only 3 cases, and the rest of children underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided kidney biopsies. The most procedures of patients aged 10 or younger were executed under general anesthesia due to the non-cooperation of them. About 30 % of the biopsy-proven kidney diseases showed immunoglobulin A nephropathy, and approximately 20 percent of those were Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis. For the post biopsy complications, 5 out of all performances administered hemostatic agents for moderate hematoma, but none of them required blood transfusion or surgical intervention. Conclusion: We suggested that renal biopsy could be supportively performed under local anesthesia in the patients more than the upper grades of elementary school. In addition, 17 patients aged 3 or younger, including 12 months, could undergo the percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsies without procedural and general anesthesia complications. Therefore, our results revealed that this procedure was considered safe even in infants.",

The commonest organisms isolated were gram negative rods 12(20.3%), followed by staph aureus 11(18.6%). Sixteen (27.1%) were culture negative and 3(5.1%) were fungal peritonitis. Catheter removal related to peritonitis was performed in 20 patients in whom only one patient returned back to PD. Exit site infection (21 episodes) and tunnel infection were reported in 20 and 10 patients respectively. Catheter malfunction was the most common non infectious complication seen in 27 (61.3%) children. Other noninfectious complications include haemorrahgic effluent 5 (11.3%) children while Catheter leak, umbilical hernia and inflow pain where seen in 2 (4.5%) children each. At the end of the study 17 (18.7%) children remained PD active, 26 (28.6%) transferred to HD, 13(14.3%) transplanted, 9(9.9%) suspended from PD, 5(5.5%) lost follow up and 21(23.1%) children died. Conclusion: In the setting of our country with limited resources and investment, CAPD is efficient and successful with complications comparable to most parts of the world. Attempts to produce PD fluids locally and to train and educate health care workers will greatly improve the use of PD in developing countries.",

Renal biopsy showed findings consistent with membranous nephropathy on light microscopy with with<5% of the interstitium showing tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Immunofluorescence studies showed granular IgG and C3 along the peripheral capillary walls. Electron microscopy showed subepithelial deposits, with formation of basement membrane spikes between the deposits. Few intramembranous deposits were also present. Subendothelial and mesangial deposits were not present. There were no antibodies to BSA or cationic BSA detected in any of the five sera available. One of the five patients had circulating antibodies to PLA2R. All patients received prednisolone, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and oral calcium supplements. Two patients continued to have nephrotic range proteinuria inspite of prednisolone and were started on cyclosporine. None of the patients developed any complications.

Children were aged between few months and 10 years. All children were treated with adequate antibiotic therapy. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in a few days after infection and control scintigraphy was performed 5 months to 36 months later. DMSA findings were categorised as normal, generally diminished uptake of activity, focally diminished uptake of activity and clearly pathologic with renal scars. Results: The first DMSA scintigraphy immediately after infection was normal in 12 kidneys (26.1%), generally diminished activity was found in 21 kidneys (45.7%) and focally diminished activity in 6 kidneys (13% ). Renal scars were present in 7 kidneys (15.2%) . On the control scintigraphy 20 kidneys (43.5%) had normal findings. Generally diminished activity were found in 6 kidneys (13%) and focal diminished uptake in 8 kidneys (17.4%). Significantly higher number of scars, in 12 kidneys (26.1%), despite of antibiotic treatment were found on the control scintigraphy (p< 0.01). Conclusion: DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated that the infection with P-fimbriatedE.coli can result in permanent renal damage, which clearly points to UTI with P-fimbriatedE.coli as a risk factor in renal damage. Our results confirm obligatory scintigraphic follow-up of children with positive P-fimbriatedE.coli infection. Objective: Efficacy of mannitol with furosemide was compared with that of albumin with furosemide in the treatment of diuretic resistant oedema in childhood nephrotic syndrome. Methods: Forty patients fulfilling the criteria for \"resistant oedema\" in nephrotic syndrome cases were enrolled in this descriptive cross sectional study. Resistant oedema was diagnosed based on failure to achieve therapeutic response to diuretics or a weight loss of <1% body weight daily. All nephrotic syndrome patients with severe oedema, age 1 year to 15 years of both sexes were hospitalized and were managed with fluid restriction, no added salt and bed rest. Beside these 2 mg/kg/day oral furosemide or combination of furosemide and spironolactone, were given for 3 days to achieve desired diuresis. Those patients who did not get response were divided into two groups (Group-A, Group-B) in consecutive fashion. The Group-A study population, was with intravenous mannitol 0.5-1 gm/kg/day in single daily dose over 1-2 hrs followed by intravenous furosemide 1 mg/kg/day for 5 days. The Group-B study population was with intravenous albumin, 0.5 -1 gm/ kg /day in single daily dose over 1-2 hrs followed by intravenous furosemide 1 mg/kg/day in every alternate day, total 3 doses. Conclusion: This boy presented with Rhabdomyolysis, myohemoglobinuria and ARF. (Similar Pr Similar Presentation can be rarely seen in human being, but often seen in dogs). Blood exchange transfusion in time must be necessary for preventing \"water fall effect\" established, for it can eliminate inflammatory factor and toxic products such as BUN, Ccr, and creatinasein blood effectively.

Eleven children were on different HAART regimes (see table 1), one was receiving nevirapine prophylaxis and one was not on any treatment. The duration of HAART use was 1-16 months (mean of 8+/-2 months). Seven (7) children were on cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis Jiroveci prophylaxis and 4 on anti-tuberculosis drugs, namely rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide. None received any nephrotoxic drugs. The HIV viral load was >1000 copies/ml in 8 children and <1000 copies/ml in 5 children. Of 13 HIV-infected children, 4(31%) had no abnormal urine protein excretion and nine (69%) had elevated urinary levels of \u03b22-microglobulin.Of note only 2 (22%) of the 9 children with \u03b22-microglobulinuria had associated proteinuria. Ten children ( 76%) had metabolic acidosis with the mean serum bicarbonate (CO 2 ) level of 16.9 mmol/l ( range 10-20 mmol/l). Conclusion: Proteinuria is believed to be the earliest finding for the diagnosis of HIV associated renal diseases. In our study \u03b22microglobulinuria and metabolic acidosis were the prominent findings suggesting that HIV induces tubular dysfunction in children without clinical evidence of renal disease. Objective: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important cause of mortality in sub Saharan Africa because access to renal replacement therapy is limited. There are few reports on haemodialysis in childhood AKI in the sub region. We therefore performed a preliminary review of data on children who received intermittent haemodialysis for AKI in our centre. Method: A retrospective review of case records and haemodialysis registers of children in AKI who received haemodialysis in our centre from January 2006 to December 2012. Results: 62 children, including a child aged 3years, received haemodialysis for AKI over the period but full details were available for 23 children and were further reviewed for this study. There were 13 males (56.5%). The children were aged 5-13 (8.4+/-2.4) years. The primary aetiology of AKI was related to intravascular haemolysis (IVH) with massive haemoglobinuria (n=12), septicaemia (n=4), acute glomerulonephritis (n=2), malignancies (n=2), malaria (n=1), HIV (n=1) and haemolyticuraemic syndrome (n=1). The aetiology of IVH was secondary to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in 4 patients, autoimmune haemolyticanaemia in 1 and was unknown in the others. One of the patients with IVH secondary to G6PD deficiency also had malaria. The number of sessions of dialysis ranged from 1 to 5 sessions per patient with a modal value of 2 Objectives, Methods and Results: A twelve-day old, formula-fed, full term neonate with unremarkable perinatal history was admitted for poor oral feeding and significant (12%) weight loss. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Investigation showed normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia (6.5mmol/L), hyperurecemia (14.5mmol/L) but normal creatinine (28umol/L). Metabolic screen and other investigation was unremarkable. On further questioning parents has been feeding baby with goat milkbased formula since day 5. Baby was switched back to normal cow milk-based formula with prompt resolution of metabolic disturbance and without recurrence of acidosis on follow-up.",

However there is good evidence suggesting against these misbelief and there are even reported morbidities associated with ingestion of goat milkbased formula. With increasing appealing but not necessarily accurate information available on the Internet, what the public need is education. Objective: There have been great inroads made in controlling the scourge of HIV in South Africa. The national PMTCT program has reduced the MTCT rate to 3.5% and children infected prior to these interventions are now on effective treatment programs. These children are now surviving longer and so we are seeing increased numbers of HIV related renal pathology presenting to our clinics. Before the widespread availability of ARV's in South Africa these children would have been denied access to our program but now we are able to offer them CRRTand a transplant. The biggest challenge facing our program is one of the social disintergration of much of our indigent population. The vast majority of our patients come from social backgrounds that are incompatible with adhering to the rigours of a chronic renal program. This is compounded when the care givers are themselves ill or when the child has a second serious illness such as HIV to deal with. Methods: We would like to present our experience with admitting 8 HIV positive children with CKD5 to our chronic program and will highlight the challenges that face these families and their health care providers. We will describe the social issues affecting each family and how they impact on the child's care.",

He was treated as atopic dermatitis all the time. But the rashes were recurrent. Erythema could be seen after desquamation. 2 weeks before admission, he had arthralgia on the right knee, 2 days later on left knee without swelling, both were retrieved spontaneously. X-ray of the knees revealed no abnormal. Ten days before admission, edema and decreased urine output was notice without gross hematuria. Physical examination in local hospital revealed blood pressure 140/108 mmHg, Needlelike erythematous maculopapules in his hands and feet. Urine test revealed protein 5g/L, RBC 164/ul, no casts.

Among 64 patients (41%) with HSP nephritis, 42 had isolated hematuria and/or non-nephrotic range proteinuria (66%), 15 nephritic syndrome (23%) and 6 nephritic/nephrotic syndrome (10%). Hematuria and/or nonnephritic proteinuria was less common (p=0.0005) in the second tenyear period while the incidence of nephritic/nephrotic syndrome was insignificant (p=0.807). Recurrences of purpura had 11 patients within 2 years. 6 patients had renal biopsy including one with 30% of crescents and one another with IgA nephropathy diagnosed seven years after initial presentation of HSP. Long-term prognosis was favourable in most patients with abnormal urine analyses in 12 (20%), in one with hypertension but normal serum creatinine and in all with nephritic/nephrotic syndrome at disease onset. Conclusion: clinical evaluation of patients with HSP nephritis treated at our institution showed a good long-term prognosis. Urine and blood pressure abnormalities in followed-up patients were associated with nephritis at disease onset. -up (f-up) . eGFR was estimated using Schwartz formula; decline in renal function was defined as the slope of eGFR over the f-up. Results: 72% were males, with mean age at renal biopsy of 12.7 \u00b1 3.7 y and a median f-up of 4.7 y (IQ range 2.4-7.8 y); more than 80% presented with eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73m 2 . End-stage renal disesase (ESRD) was reached by 4% of children, 50% loss of initial eGFR by 5%; 7% reached the combined end point (ESRD or 50% loss of initial eGFR). At renal biopsy 57% presented with mesangial proliferation (M1), 24% with endocapillary proliferation (E1), 35% with segmental glomerulosclerosis (S1) and 9% with tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (TA/IF; T1/2). Patients with segmental sclerosis and TA/IF showed a significantly worse eGFR slope over the f-up (S0 vs S1 p=0.04; T0 vs T1/2 p=0.003). At univariate linear regression, clinical data at renal biopsy (eGFR, proteinuria and MAP) were not associated with renal function decline, while data at 6-12 and 12-24 months and TA-proteinuria and MAP significantly predicted eGFR slope.A multivariate linear regression model (including proteinuria and MAP at 12-24 months together with the difference of eGFR at renal biopsy and at 12-24 months as independent variables) performed well in predicting eGFR slope (R 2 =0.39). This model was used to derive a formula able to estimate eGFR slope with good performance (mean bias between estimated and really observed eGFR slope of 0.05 \u00b1 6.6 ml/min/1.73m 2 ). Conclusion: The Oxford classification of IgAN was well applicable to this pediatric population. A formula was developed that estimates renal function decline over the f-up based on proteinuria, MAP and eGFR loss after 1-2 years of observation, which will need a validation on other cohorts.",

There was no significant decrease in GFR within the entire cohort. However, five patients showed decreased renal function, and of them, two reached stage III or IV CKD. The five patients' changes in the K/DOQI CKD stage were 2 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, 1 to 2, and 1 to 2. Their pathological classifications were Haas 4/M1 S1 E0 T0, Haas 4/M1 S0 E1 T1 with global sclerosis, Haas 1/M0 S1 E0 T0, Haas 1/M0 S0 E0 T0, and Haas 1/M0 S0 E0 T0 with global sclerosis. In the Oxford classification, global sclerosis was the only factor correlated with decreased renal function, whereas the Haas classification showed no significant correlation with renal function. Conclusions: Global sclerosis was correlated with decreased renal function. However, in our cohort, there was no significant decrease in renal function during the follow-up period (P = 0.216). Thus, we could not clearly correlate the Haas and Oxford classifications with renal outcome. The value of the Oxford classification as a predictor of renal outcome remains unclear in Korean children with IgA nephropathy.",

We recently experienced a case of IgA nephropathy with deterioration of renal function complicated by Crohn's disease. A 15- year-old boy diagnosed as having Crohn's disease underwent total colectomy at the age of 7 years. The patient was referred to pediatric gastroenterology unit at the age of 13, and thereafter maintained a state of remission form Crohn's disease while receiving 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Two months prior to referral to our pediatric nephrology unit, when the patient was 15 years old, a school health examination had revealed microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria. At that time, laboratory tests suggested deterioration of renal function. Renal biopsy was performed and histological examination by light microscopy demonstrated focal segmental mesangial proliferation and moderate tubule atrophy with a diffuse interstitial inflammatory infiltrate consisting predominantly of lymphocytes. Immunofluorescence assays revealed 2+ diffuse granular staining for IgA and 1+ staining for C3 in the mesangium. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having IgA nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis. The 5-ASA therapy was stopped considering the possibility that it had induced interstitial nephritis. The renal function of the patient has since remained quiescent for 7 months. Patients with Crohn's disease who present with abnormal urinalysis findings commonly have urological complications, such as urolithiasis and urinary tract infections. However, the possibility of renal parenchymal disease including IgA nephropathy should also be considered, even if there is no apparent aggregative linkage of urinalysis findings with gastrointestinal symptoms of Crohn's disease.",

The typical pathological features, such as the diffuse glomerular mesangial and endocapillary proliferation, mesangial interposition, and double contour formation, were shown in all specimens. Moreover, the podocyte hypertrophy, shedding, and cytoplasmic absorption dropletswere also observed in most specimens under light microscopy. The percentage of small cellular crescents varied from 4.25-25%. 9 patients were followed up for 2 to 4 years, and all had recovered. Conclusion: The predominant clinical manifestation of ISKDC grade VI HSPN in children was NS accompanying with hematuria. The well outcome might be associated with the prompt use of steroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs at the onset of ISKDC grade VI HSPN with very mild glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesion. In our future study, all patients should be followed for five or ten years, and more specimens should be observed under electron microscope to investigate whether the podocyte lesions of ISKDC grade VIHSPN should be taken into account in the clinical pathological report and a future new histologic classification of HSPN. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment in children with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and Henoch-Schoenlein nephritis (HSN) based on clinical manifestation and histopathological Oxford (O-C) and WHO (WHO-C) classifications.",

Results: 142 patients were included. Nephrotic range proteinuria was present in 28% with grade II, 60% with grade III and 90% with grade IV lesions. Renal function was impaired in 14%. Significant proteinuria >500 mg/L was found in 9/48 patients 3 years post renal biopsy, in 8/25 patients at 5 years and in 3/14 patients at 10 years. There was no correlation between risk for proteinuria at 3, 5, or 10 years with initial histological lesions. There was a tendency to higher residual proteinuria in patients with nephrotic proteinuria at disease onset and also for patients who were not treated with steroid pulses at disease onset with 310 vs. 175 mg/L (p=0.06) at three months, 100 vs. 50 mg/L (p=0.93) at one year, 720 vs. 150 mg/L (p=0.1) at five years, and 520 vs. 355 mg/L (p=0.35) at ten years. There was a tendency to less proteinuria in the long term for those with early steroid pulses (<15 days vs. >16 days after proteinuria onset (p=0.16).In patients with ACEi/ARB treatment within 15 days after renal disease onset, compared to those who were treated later (>one month), proteinuria was significantly lower at 6 (p=0.02) and 12 months (p=0.03). Among 18 control kidney biopsies, 50% show fibrosis of different degree unrelated to initial histology. Conclusion: There is a risk to underestimate long term disease severity in patients with low ISKDC classes. There is need for prospective long term studies to explore the benefit of early ACEi/ARB and/or steroid pulses.",

However, the mechanism is not clear. Methods: We investigated whether Cosmc gene( C1GALT1C1 )methylation is an important mechanism in IgAN in children. Methods 33(M:F=25:8) primaryIgAN children and 39(M:F=28:11) healthy controls were enrolled randomly. The methylation status of the C1GALT1C1 was detected using bisulfite-specific polymerase chain reaction (BSP)-based sequencing analysis. Results: The male patients had obviousely high methylation percentage than the male controls(p=0.047). Three significant hypermethylation sites were identified in the male patients: CpG site 20 (p = 0.034), site 21 (p = 0.039), andsite 26 (p = 0.047). In the female groups,the patients and the normal controls all had high level methylation without significance (p=0.947). Conclusion: Methylation of C1GALT1C1 might have the vital significance in the susceptibility to the male IgAN patients.",

Multiple regression analysis showed that the mesangial hypercellularity score correlated with ACE2 expression level in glomeruli and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (r = 0.6295, P < 0.0001). In IgAN patients not treated with a RAS blocker (ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers), ACE2 expression levels in glomeruli were significantly increased compared to patients with MGA (P < 0.0001). IgA patients treated with a RAS blocker did not show this increase in ACE2 exrepssion. Furthermore, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression was enhanced by interleukin-1 beta, a pro-inlammatory cytokine, and suppressed by transforming growth factor-beta 1 , a pro-fibotic factor in the progression of IgAN.

In immune mature cells, particularly dendritic cells, the PS, under the action of interferon gamma and alpha, becomes an immunoproteasome (iPS), by substituting 3 catalytic units beta1, beta2, beta5 with other low molecular weight proteins (LMP2 and LMP7) and an endopeptidase-like complex (MECL-1). This modification confers an optimal catalytic property for professional presentation of specific peptides to MHC Class I. Our group previously demonstrated that adult patients with IgA-Nephropathy (IgAN) have an increased expression of iPS catalytic subunit, which correlated with the severity of renal disease.Aim of this study was to investigate the switch from PS to iPS in children with primary IgAN and with Henoch-Schoenlein purpura (HSP), a vasculitis sharing with IgAN several immune system abnormalities. Methods: Peripheral Lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from 18 children with IgAN, 57 with HSP and 33 healthy control subjects (HC), isolated by centrifugation gradient, were tested with real time PRC (Taqman) to assess quantitatively the mRNA levels of PS alpha subunit (constitutive), of the active subunit of PS (beta1, beta2, beta5) and of iPS (LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1). Results: Objective: Recent studies suggest that dysregulated innate immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAnephropathy (IgAN). Interleukin-20 subfamily and its receptor, interleukin-22 receptor alpha-1 (IL-22R1), were recently identified as immunomodulators in human diseases, acting as mediators of mucosal host defense.

The overall prognosis of HSP is favorable, but the long-term outcome is dependent on the degree of renal involvement. The incidence of renal involvement varies from 20 to 60% and there have been some reports showing that nephritis might be related to an older age at onset, persistent purpura (> 1 month), severe abdominal pain, and relapsing disease.Recently, several studies have shown that galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) is recognized by anti-glycan antibodies, resulting in the formation of the circulating immune complexes and their mesangial deposition causing renal injury in HSP nephritis and serum galactose-deficient IgA1 levels were highly inherited in children with HSP nephritis.Regarding the treatment of HSP, one randomized double-blinded controlled study recently showed that patients with abdiminal pain or arthralgia may benefit from early treatment with prednisone, but the drug has not been proven to be capable of preventing the development of renal symptoms. However, it was effective in altering the course of renal involvementMild Henoch-Schoenlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) generally does not require aggressive treatment due to a favorable course of the disease, but severe nephritis has a high risk of progression to end stage renal failure. Although several intensive therapies, such as intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone pulse, immunosuppressive/cytotoxic drugs, fibrinolytic therapy, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agent and plasma exchange, have been used in children with severe HSPN, treatment of HSPN still remains controversial due to the rarity of randomized controlled studies in this field.",

The effacement of podocyte foot processes typically arises owing to perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. Calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporien A (CsA) is currently used in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome. Recent data suggest that the effects of CsA on nephrotic syndrome are independent of its effects on the immune system. They identified that CsA can stabilize the actin cytoskeleton through stabilizing synaptopodin in podocytes and thereby reduce proteinuria directly. Other studies also showed that CsA induced cofilin phosphorylation and promoted stress fiber generation in proximal tubular cells. However, whether the antiproteinuric role of CsA is played by regulating cofilin-1 in podocyte has not been studied. Methods: Acute podocyte injury and nephrotic syndrome were induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) injection in rats with or without CsA. Cultured podocytes were exposed to PAN with or without CsA treatment. Cofilin-1, nephrin, synaptopodin expression were determined by western blot or immunofluorescence.

Some mice were sacrificed 7 days after PAN-injection, and their serum concentrations of cholesterol, total protein, albumin and IL-6 were measured and the pathological changes of the kidneys were observed. Results: PAN injection without DHMEQ in the mice induced albuminuria which gradually increased up to day 10 and gradually decreased thereafter. In contrast, pre-treatment with DHMEQ was associated with no significant increase in the amount of albuminuria during the first 2 weeks. In the serological tests, PAN-injection induced an increase in the cholesterol level, a decrease in the total protein, a decrease in the albumin and an increase in the IL-6 in the serum compared to controls 7 days after injection, but DHMEQ ameliorated these changes. An electron microscopic analysis indicated an effacement of the foot processes of the podocytes in the PAN-injected mice, but this was rarely observed in the PAN-injected mice pre-treated with DHMEQ. Further immunohistochemical analysis showed that DHMEQ can inhibit the PAN-induced translocation of NF-\u03baB from cytoplasm into nucleus. Conclusion: These results suggest that DHMEQ can be a candidate therapeutic agent for MCNS, because the activation of NF-\u03baB of podocytes may be associated with PAN-induced nephrosis.",

Results: Podocytes express estrogen receptors both, estrogen receptor alpha and beta, suggesting that increasing levels of estradiol during puberty potentially maintains and restores morphological integrity of podocytes. This protective function could be mediated by stabilization of the podocyte cytoskeleton by estradiol, as evidenced in vitro by the increase in phosphorylation of cofilin, very similar to the effects of estradiol in neurons. Furthermore, we show that dissociated podocytes express aromatase, the final enzyme of estrogen synthesis, and that podocytes in fact synthesize estradiol, as evidenced by measuring estradiol content in the supernatant. Conclusion: As it was shown that estrogen synthesis in cells other than those in gonads becomes stimulated during puberty, an autocrine mechanism of estrogen action could underlie decreasing frequency of MCGN at the onset of puberty.",

It shows cytoprotective effects in different cell types and helps to maintain cell homeostasis. Some studies demonstrated that cell stress, generated by starvation or some chemical reagents, can initiate autophagy which responsively resists harmful stimuli at the early stage. However, little is known about autophagy in human podocytes under oxidative stress. Since the apoptosis and autophagy pathways share some common molecules, we investigated the role of autophagy induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) in human podocytes. Methods: Human conditional immortalized podocytes were treated with PAN, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by immunofluorescence. Then, autophagy was assayed by immunofluorecence staining for LC3 puncta and western blotting for LC3. In addition, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrates which play critical roles in autophagy inhibition were investigated for elucidating the mechanism of PAN induced autophagy. Podocyte apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (YO-PRO-1/PI and active caspase 3 assays). To study the effects of autophagy on podocyte apoptosis, 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine were used to inhibit autophagy. Results: Autophagy was detected in PAN-treated podocytes in a dose and time dependent manner and prior to apoptosis which was accompanied with increased ROS generation. LC3 aggregates were observed in the cytoplasm and the expression of LC3 II was significantly elevated. Intriguingly, Phospho-mTOR and its substrates (Phospho-p70 S6 Kinase and Phospho-4E-BP1) increased when the autophagy was activated. When autophagy was inhibited by 3MA and chloroquine, podocyte apoptosis increased significantly.",

For the mutation negative patients, effects of other disease causing genes involving NPHS1, WT1, TRPC6, CD2AP, and ACTN4 for different molecular subtypes of SRNS may be considered. NPHS1 mutation screening was performed for all the patients who had proteinuria up to two years of age. As a causative SRNS gene, we should consider NPHS2 gene mutation screening in early diagnosis and the follow-up of the clinical course. Conclusion: In relation to homozygous or compound heterozygous NPHS2 mutated patients who have the lack of response to standard steroid therapy we suggest to perform NPHS2 gene mutation analysis for every child (if consent can be obtained) soon after the first episode of NS. For the newly diagnosed patients, the crucial certain determination of the causative disease gene mutation will enable clinicians to avoid redundant immunosuppressive therapeutic trials. We then performed Next Generation Sequencing in the 5 affected patients and in one of their unaffected relatives. Exome enrichment was conducted using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V4+ UTRs capture kit. The multiplex libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument with a 2x76 bp read length. Results: We unexpectedly identified a novel LMX1B mutation segregating with the disease in the family. Subsequently, we screened 74 additional unrelated families from our international cohort of autosomal dominant FSGS and found mutations of the same residue in 2 families. None of the probands had any sign of dysplasia of nails, patellae or elbows, iliac horns or glaucoma, or any ultrastructural changes suggestive of Nail-Patella-like renal lesions. LMX1B encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is essential during development. A LMX1B in silicohomology model suggests the mutated residue plays an important role in strengthening the interaction between the LMX1B homeodomain and DNA. Both mutations are expected to diminish such interactions.",

These patients showed a more severe form of the disease compared to affected family members who showed only the causative mutation without additional modifier variants. One additional patient of this cohort with Pierson syndrome had two single heterozygous mutations in NPHS1 and LAMB2, respectively (both genes following an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance). A further patient showed two mutations in NPHS1 and the non-neutral polymorphism p.Arg229Gln in NPHS2.

Results: We detected disease-causing mutations in 64.9% (24 of 37) patients (75% in congenital and 25% in infantile) (Table) . Objective: Hypercoagulability along with thrombosis are prevalent complications of nephrotic syndrome. In cases of refractory nephrotic syndrome, intracardiac thrombus, although rare, is a serious complication because of its association with morbidity and high mortality Herein, we report a case of a patient with a right atrial thrombus associated with nephrotic syndrome who responded well to corticosteroid therapy and attained quick remission. Case Presentation: A 12-year-old Japanese boy was referred to our hospital for a right atrial thrombus associated with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome diagnosed 1 month ago. The patient had attained the partial remission within the 10 days of the corticosteroid therapy initiation. He was asymptomatic otherwise at the time of admission. The patient's vitals were stable and laboratory values were almost within the normal range. An echocardiogram showed a large isolated hyperechoic mass in the right atrium, which originated from the superior right atrial wall. The mass measured 31 \u00d7 26 mm in diameter and traversed through the tricuspid valve in a to-and-fro motion. The patient underwent emergency surgical thrombectomy on day 1 and anticoagulation therapy was started 7 days after the operation. The subsequent hospital stay was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 87. Objective: Nephrotic syndrome features proteinuria and severe sodium retention which is implicated in ascites and edema formation. Previous works realized in nephrotic rats (PAN) clearly highlighted that, the increase of sodium absorption in the CCD is associated with an increase activity of the Na/K ATPase; sodium absorption is independent of aldosterone, activation of epithelial sodium channel ENaC is not necessary and sodium absorption is inhibited by amiloride. Our hypothesis is that, in nephrotic syndrome, another apical sodium channel sensitive to amiloride and independent of SAAR pathway is implicated in sodium absorption in the CCD. Methods: Transcriptome of CCDs from control rats (CT) and PAN treated clamped rats (ADX PAN) was analyzed using a high-resolution quantitative and comparative analysis of gene expression. Subsequently, transcriptional (RT-qPCR) and proteic expression (western blot and immunohistochemistry) of channel were analyzed. Sodium handling in vivo and in vitro microperfused collecting ducts in different conditions (pH 6 and 7.4, apical zinc 0.3mM and amiloride 0.1mM) was analyzed.",

RT-qPCR confirmed an increased expression of ACCN1 only in the CCD of ADX PAN (about eight time compared to ADX CT). Subsequently, protein shows an increase expression of ACCN1 (ADX PAN 0.72+/-0.12 vs ADX CT 0.31+/-0.03, p 0.03) and immunohistochemistry on microdissecated CCD highlighted a strong apical expression of ACCN1 only in ADX PAN rats. Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a rare autosomalrecessive multisystem disorder, characterised by: disproportionate growth deficiency, defective cellular immunity, nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal disease.SIOD is caused by bi-allelic mutations of SMARCAL1 gene, which encodes the HepA-related protein (HARP), a member of the SNF2 family of ATPases, acting as chromatin remodelers within multi-protein complexes. A 5-year-old patient was hospitalized in November 2011, after detection of proteinuria (1.5 g/day). At our first clinical examination: height-weightgrowth retardation, thinning hair, thin and hypopigmented skin, arched palate and normal neuro-psychological development.Serological examination showed proteinuria (1.7 g/day), hyperchol. (Col tot 242 mg/dl, LDL-Col 165 mg/dl) and lymphocyte deficiency (17.6%).Renal function and complement levels were normal. Lymphocyte subpopulations showed a decrease of T lymphocytes and an increase of NK cells(CD16 + CD56 +).The patient had also a detour back-lumbar scoliosis and normal kidneys in size, but with reduced corticomedullarydifferentiation. We started therapy with ramipril 2.5 mg/day. The 24 hrs urine exams performed monthly showed persistent proteinuria (500-800 mg/day). At the end of April 2012, for the persistence of proteinuria, we performed renal biopsy, which showed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. At discharge, she started therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg/day with significant reduction of proteinuria (140 mg/day). After 6 months of therapy, thepatient did not present proteinuria and her renal function was normal. The molecular genetic study of SMARCAL1 gene revealed that patient was compound heterozygous for two mutations: a novel missense mutation in exon 3, inherited by mother, and a nonsense paternally-derived mutation in exon 17, leading to a truncated SMARCAL1 protein. Our data allow us to diagnose a Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD). In most patients, life expectancy is limited to childhood or early adolescence, due to the onset of stroke, infections,hematopoietic bone marrow failure and renal failure. Only patients with milder and late onset forms can survive until adulthood.",

Functional studies demonstrated that the conformation of integrin alpha-3 is affected and the mutant alpha-3 precursor is targeted for degradation. Consistent with these findings, alpha-3 integrin was not detected in the patient glomeruli. Furthermore, integrin alpha-3 protein expression was absent in murine podocytes that lack endogenous integrin alpha-3 and transfected with mutant ITGA3. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the role of the integrin alpha-3beta-1 complex as the main regulator of podocyte basement membrane integrity. Here, we show that hyperglycosylation of the integrin alpha-3 subunit, causing the complete lack of alpha-3-beta-1 expression on the basement membrane, is a new pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital nephrotic syndrome and interstitial lung disease.

Methods: 12 suspected ARPKD patients from 10 unrelated families were detected on mutations of PKHD1 gene by PCR direct sequencing. These patients were evaluated by combining the testing results and their clinical materials. Results: In the 6 detected children, 4 mutations (P137S, V836A, Q1574H, L2658X) were novel and 7 mutations (T36M, R559W, R760C, N830S, A1262V, Q3899R, Q4048R) were previously described. 4 of the 11 variants were definite pathogenic mutations. Two pathogenic mutations in both chromosomes were found in 2 out of 6 families (30%), which greatly aid to making definite diagnoses. The 4 families with perinatal presentation consisted of 2 fetuses and 2 couples. One definite pathogenic mutation (S3457C) was found in the wife of family No.9, however, it was still difficult in conforming the diagnosis owing to lack of the pathogenic mutation from the husband.

Conclusion: We emphasize that SIOD is to be considered in children with growth retardation, SRNS and bone abnormalities and that inherited nephrotic syndrome may be presented in late childhood or even adolescence and SIOD suspected patients even before full picture development should be closely monitored for proteinuria, hypertension, cellular immunity and opportunistic infections especially with the need to start immune suppressive therapy for nephrotic syndrome.",

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease was excluded by a normal liver biopsy. A kidney biopsy showed diffuse mesangial sclerosis. At the age of 7 months, she developed a unilateral Wilm's tumor, which was treated by heminephrectomy and chemotherapy. The renal cysts were still present on ultrasound. Histological examination of a cyst (located in the resected specimen, but separate from the Wilm's tumor) showed one layer of flattened epithelial cells, without any evidence of malignancy. The combination of diffuse mesangial sclerosis and a Wilm's tumor pointed to the diagnosis of DDS. Genetic analysis showed a de novo heterozygous missense mutation c.1186G>A (p.Asp396Asn) in the WT1 gene, previously described in patients with DDS, confirming the diagnosis. Because polycystic kidneys have never been reported in DDS, we explored several genes responsible for these renal manifestations, such as HNF-1\u03b2, PAX2, PKD1 and PKD2. Remarkably, we identified a heterozygous missense variant c.12439A>G (p.Lys4147Glu) in the PKD1 gene. Mutations in PKD1 lead to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The pathogenicity of the newly identified missense variant in our case was evaluated by different mutation prediction software programs and was classified as being 'likely pathogenic'.

We hypothesize that PKD1 c.12439A>G variant might be an incompletely penetrant allele that can cause a severe phenotype of ADPKD in association with a WT1 gene mutation. The phosphatase and tensine homolog (PTEN) gene is a tumor suppressor gene located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q22-23). The PTEN protein is broadly expressed in cells throughout the body, acting as both lipid and protein phosphatases, and regulates intracellular signaling via various pathways. Reduced PTEN protein resulting from a PTEN gene mutation may enhance cell proliferation, resist from apoptosis. In addition, it has became clear that, in vascular endothelial cells, PTEN gene abnormalities lead to increased expressions of vascular growth factors, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), that are essential to angiogenesis. Recent reports revealed a germline mutation of the PTEN gene to cause several syndromes with generalized, multiple hamartomatous lesions of tridermic origin. Thus, the new concept of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) has been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, we describe here for the first time a case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with PHTS. A 3-year-old girl was found to have proteinuria and hematuria on health examination and referred to us for persistent urinary abnormalities. IgM nephropathy were diagnosed by renal biopsy, and she started taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, proteinuria was not reduced, and an oral angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) was administered. Proteinuria persisted and she underwent renal biopsy again, yielding a diagnosis of FSGS. Despite continued oral ARB treatment, proteinuria is ongoing with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of approximately 0.5, and mild renal impairment. At age 13 years, 2 years ago, a neck mass prompted a detailed examination which revealed multiple thyroid nodules, ovarian cysts (mucinous cystadenoma), hemangiomas in the plantar and femoral regions, spinal cord lipoma, and renal nodular lesions, necessitating follow-up. Subsequently, additional workup detected a PTEN gene heterozygous mutation (exon 8 codon 335 CGA(Arg) TGA(STOP)) and she was diagnosed with PHTS. Methods: A 7-day-old girl, the first child of non-consanguineous Chinese parents, was hospitalized due to edema, gross proteinuria, and progressive renal failure. She was delivered spontaneously at 36 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2700gand a body length of48cm. During the delivery, she was experienced mild asphyxia.

The compound heterozygous mutations (c.2020C>T and c.2207T>C) lie between Ig6 and Ig7 domain which has a free cysteine residues. These mutations might cause misfolding and defective intracellular transport, with consequent absence of the mutant nephrin on the plasma membrane.",

Immunoblot and selected reaction Objective: Inherited distal RTA (dRTA) is a rare condition and is almost always observed in children as a primary entity. Mutations in genes encoding transporter or channel proteins operating along the renal tubule may result in a variety of functional defects. The identification of the molecular defects in dRTA may provide a basis for future design of targeted therapeutic interventions and, possibly, strategies for gene therapy of these complex disorders. For this reason, we evaluated mutations in SLC4A1 and ATP6V1B1 genes. Methods Genomic DNA from 20 pediatric patients diagnosed with dRTA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Sequencing was performed for five exons of SLC4A1 (14, 15, 17, 19, 20) and two exons of ATP6V1B1 (1, 7). All the selected exons are considered hotspots for mutations associated to this tubular disorder.",

The mutation c.2688T>C was identified in exon 20 of SLC4A1 in one patient and the second variation (c.27T>C) was found in exon 1 of ATP6V1B1 in two patients. Although previously described, these silent variations are not highly frequent in the overall population. Also in SLC4A1, exon 19, two nonsynonymous variations were identified in the same patient (p.Pro854Leu and p.Val862Ile). The p.Val862Ile variation was also found in three other patients. It has been shown that these variations are rare polymorphisms in the population, but they have already been associated to Diego group erythrocyte antigen. In exon 1 of ATP6V1B1 the variation p.Met2? was presented in twelve patients and the mutation p.Thr30Ile was found in six patients. Although they occur in the coding region of ATP6V1B1, these variations have been described as highly frequent in the population. Dent's disease is an X -linked renal proximal tubulopathy associated with mutations in CLCN5 (Dent's type 1) and OCRL1 (Dent's type 2).OCRL1 mutations also cause the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe.

Our patient presented at 3 years of age with incidental finding of non-nephrotic range proteinuria. He had elevated urinary beta -2 microglobulin, retinol binding protein and hypercalciuria. He was developmentally normal and is otherwise of good general health. Slit lamp examination and vision were normal. He had normal renal function but had very poor renal accumulation of 99mTc-DMSA on renoscintigraphy. Genetic testing identified a hemizygous change, c.2T>C p.(Met1), in exon 1 of OCRL, which affects the translation initiation codon. His healthy 8 year old brother who was also found to have low -molecular weight proteinuria and hypercalciuria, is currently being investigated. To the best of our knowledge, the hemizygous change, c.2T>C p.(Met1?) in exon 1 of the OCRL gene which was identified in our patient with Dent's disease represents a novel variant which has not been previously reported in a Dent's disease patient.",

This report concerns a 13-year-old girl, born to consanguineous parents (first degree cousins). She has no family history of nephrocalcinosis or kidneydisease. Her unique brother, aged 8 years, is in good health and has no dental or renal problems. She was first seen at the age of 12 years in dentistrydepartment because of dental abnormalities, the diagnosis of amelogenosis imperfecta was made and the patient was further investigated. A renal ultrasound showed a bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. CT confirmed bilateral nephrocalcinosis which was associated to ovarian and splenic calcifications. Besides this young girl has a normal growth, her puberty began at the age of 12 years. Laboratory findings including serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphate, parathormone and alkaline phosphatase were within normal ranges. On urine examination we found a hypocalciuria, with normal sodium and phosphate excretion. The patient is regularly seen in both dentistry department and pediatrics. The aim of this report is to highlight the important role of pediatricians as well as dentists in recognizing this rare and uncommon syndrome. Objective: IPEX syndrome, a hereditary (X-linked) immune dysregulation with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy, as the basic manifestations, presents a rare and severe disease.

We registered hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, glycosuria, low molecular weight proteinuria and ultrasound revealed second stage bilateral nephrocalcinosis. In this child there was no apparent glomerular involvement, as it was seen in the eldest sibling. Conclusion: Dent's disease is an X-linked renal proximal tubulopathy associated with mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCN5 (Xp11.22), which is next to FOXP3 gene on the X chromosome (Xp11.23-q13.3). It seems that in this sibling mutations occurred in exons of both of these genes. This case is to remind on pleomorphic potential of mutations that occur near the coding regions of the FOXP3 gene. Objective: multiple target organ defects (MTOD) is a subgroup of pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I and salt wasting is more severe in this form of PHA I. It has a poorer outcome than the renal form, and therapy must be maintained throughout life. Here, we reported an infant with MTOD who had severe hyperkalemia resistant to classical treatment of PHA. Hyperkalemia was normalized only by peritoneal dialysis (PD). Case: A 4 month-old boy was admitted to our hospital with persistent vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and severe hyperkalemia. There was consanguinity between parents and he had a healthy sister and brother. There was no history of medication. Physical examination revealed the signs of volume depletion and acidosis. Results: In laboratory examination, blood urea nitrogen was 71 mg/dl, creatinine 0.43 mg/dl, sodium 114mEq/L, potassium 9.5mEq/L, and chloride 97mEq/L. Blood pH was 7.33, base excess -12mEq/L, and HCO3 11mEq/L. Urinary analysis revealed low specific gravity (1003) with pH 8.0, and normal urinary sediment. Urinary sodium was 68mEq/L, potassium 1mEq/L, and plasma renin activity 80.2ng/ml (2.7-37.0), aldosterone 2800pg/ml (50-900), cortisol 11.1 mg/dl (7-17.5), and ACTH 5.5pg/ml (10-469). Renal ultrasonography did not show any abnormalities. Sweet-test showed high sodium waste from sweet glands (144mEq/L). The patient diagnosed as MTOD. Severe hyperkalemia persisted and was resistant to all treatment options for PHA, including high-sodium and low-potassium diet, fluid resuscitation, potassiumbinding resins, indomethacin, fludrocortisone, and hydrochlorothiazide. Nutritional status of the patient was also not good, and parents did not accept gastrostomy. Hyperkalemia was corrected only after PD treatment, and his nutritional status improved dramatically.",

            "text": "Objective: Previously we showed that pretreatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine (FLU) improves postischemic survival and ameliorates functional and structural kidney damage after renal ischemia/reperfusion (IR). In heart IR injury FLU is protective through activating the Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) -nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) system. Here we studied the intrarenal vasoregulatory effect of FLU and analyzed the renal S1R-NOS cascade. Methods: Male Wistar rats were were treated i.p. either with (1) vehiculum (VEH); (2) FLU (20 mg/bwkg; FLU); (3) FLU+ S1R antagonist NE-100 (1mg/bwkg; FN); (4) FLU+ non-selective NOS blocker L-NAME (10mg/bwkg); (5) FLU + selective endothelial (e) NOS blocker L-NIO (20mg/bwkg); (6) FLU and selective neuronal (n) NOS blocker 7-NI (25mg/bwkg). 30 minutes later rats were either harvested or subjected to 50 minutes of ischemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Sham-operated animals served as controls (n=10/group). Renal S1R, Akt, eNOS and nNOS protein levels were measured, the alteration of renal capillary diameters was determined in vivo using muliphoton microscopy. Results: IR induced renal vasoconstriction, which was ameliorated by FLU. This increase was neutralized by all NOS blockers, mostly by 7-NI. After IR all measured protein levels increased. S1R expression was similar in all treatment groups. Akt and eNOS levels were lower, while nNOS levels were higher in the FLU treated group compared to VEH and FN. The acute vasodilatative effect of FLU 30 minutes after treatment was suspended by L-NAME and 7-NI and even reversed by L-NIO. S1R, Akt and eNOS protein levels were elevated 30min after FLU treatment, while nNOS levels remained unchanged. Discussion: Pretreatment with the S1R agonist FLU -used chronically without notable side-effects -improves postischemic renal perfusion through the activation of S1R -NOS system in a time and NOS isoform specific manner. Based on this data one can hope to find a new therapeutic target in the treatment of renal IR damage through the modulation of the S1R. Methods: 36 SD rats were randomly divided into model group, intervention group and normal group, 12 rats in each group. Intraperitoneal injection with gentamicin for 7 days to establish renal tubular injury rat model. Then the intervention group rats were transplanted with 4\u00d710 6 /ml BM-MSCs via tail vein. 7 days after transplanted with BM-MSCs, took blood and kidney specimen of rats for testing. Serum creatinine (SCr), urea (BUN), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), Heme oxygenase -1 (HO-1) were detected by spectrophotometry. HE staining was used to evaluate the change of renal tissue pathology, then score the renal tubular injury according to the Nangaku semiquantitative scoring method.

Objective: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and both innate and adaptive immunity contribute to the pathogenesis. T cell immunoglobulin-3 (Tim-3) has been reported as an important regulatory molecule and plays a pivotal role in several inflammatory diseases. However, it keeps unknown whether Tim-3 is involved in renal IRI. To investigate the expression of Tim-3 on kidney mononuclear cells (KMNCs) from mice with renal IRI and explored its role in the pathogenesis of renal IRI. Methods: The left renal pedicle was clamped in C57BL6 mice for 45 min, followed by reperfusion. Animals were sacrificed at baseline, day 1,3. Flow cytometry was used to quantify Tim-3 expression on KMNCs ,CD4 + T cell,CD8 + T cell,Foxp3 + Tregs and CD19 + B cell. The levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 in kidney tissue were measured using ELISA. Results: At day 1, the increased expression of Tim-3 on KMNCs ,CD4 + T cell,CD8 + T cell,Foxp3 + Tregs in the injured kidney from mice with renal IRI compared to those from uninjured kidney tissues and baseline (P<0. 05). Percentage of Tim-3 + cells in KMNCs showed an inverse correlation with kidney injury score and kidney TNF-\u03b1 level. Similar negative correlations were found between kidney injury score and Tim-3 levels on CD4 + T, CD8 + T cells. Consistently, Tim-3 expression on CD3 + T cells was further increased in mice at day 3. Tim-3 expression on Foxp3 + Tregs negatively correlates with kindey TNF-\u03b1. Conclusion: Tim-3 might participate in the proceeding of renal IRI by regulation on various CD4 + T cell subsets. Tim-3 might be a potential new marker for assessing severity of renal IRI.",

Objective: We previously found that RGC-32(Response Gene to Complement-32), a key factor in regulating cell cycle, plays an important role in dealing with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of RGC-32 regulating cell cycle in renal tubular epithelial cells injury and repair. Methods: (1) Objective: Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for cellular stress adaptation and normal homeostasis. Increased level of autophagy has been reported in the post-ischemic kidneys by static analysis. This study aimed to understand the dynamics of epithelial autophagy in kidneys following acute ischemic injury and during renal repair. Methods: Taking the advantage of differential pH sensitivity of RFP (pKa 4.5) and EGFP (pKa 5.9) fluorescence, we generated a new strain of CAG-RFP-EGFP-LC3 mice to distinguish early autophagic vacuoles from autolysosomes and to monitor autophagic process in the kidneys with ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Results: Renal epithelial cells responded to nutrient deprivation with easily detectable fluorescent puncta that represented autophagic vacuoles and corresponded to LC3-II and Atg5 protein levels. The majority of the EGFP lost its fluorescence in the acidic environment of the autolysosomes where bright RFP signals remained. In normal kidneys, few EGFP and RFP puncta were present in the nephron. IRI led to dynamic changes in autophagic process in the proximal tubules with the number of EGFP puncta reaching the peak at 1 day and returning to the control level at 3 days whereas RFP puncta persisted at a high level through 3 days post injury, indicating autophagy initiation at 1 day but autophagosome clearance at 3 days as kidneys were recovering. Since RFP puncta persisted in cells with recent autophagy, we examined Ki67 expression and found significantly lower proliferation in cells that contained RFP puncta, suggesting that autophagic cells were less likely to divide for tubular repair. Furthermore, 87% proximal tubular cells with mTOR activation indicated by p-S6 kinase expression contained no RFP puncta. Inhibition of mTORC1 activity with rapamycin caused a 2-fold decrease in cell proliferation. Conclusion: Our results highlight the dynamic regulation of autophagy in post-ischemic kidneys and suggest a role of mTOR in autophagy resolution during renal repair.",

These patients show high serum levels of Ang-II and FGF-2, and are treated with heparin to prevent clotting disorders. However, the mechanisms by which heparin may affect the vascular activity of Ang-II and FGF-2 are not clearly understood. We carried out this study to determine whether heparin can modulate the vascular activity of Ang-II and FGF-2 by affecting the Rho-A, Rac-1, Src, and PKC signaling pathways. Methods: Normal FVB/N mice were injected with adenoviral vectors carrying a secreted form of human FGF-2 or Lac Z vectors, and treated with heparin (5,000 U/kg) or control buffer (n=5 per group). Vascular contractility was studied in pressurized isolated resistance-sized mouse mesenteric arteries, in the presence and absence of Ang-II and FGF-2. The activation of the Src, Rho-A, Rac-1, and PKC signaling pathways were assessed by pull-down assays and Western blots, both in vivo and in vitro. Permeability changes were explored in cultured human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGEc) using FITC-dextran. Results: Heparin significantly enhanced the FGF-2-induced activation of Rho-A and Rac-1 in the kidney and isolated mouse mesenteric vessels. In addition, heparin antagonized the Ang II-induced contractility of isolated mouse mesenteric vessels through Rho-A and PKC-dependent pathways. These changes were reverted by FGF-2, and abolished by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. Both heparin and FGF-2, acting in a synergistic manner, increased the permeability of HREC by activating the Rho-A and Src signaling pathways. Conclusion: We conclude that heparin and FGF-2, acting in a synergistic manner, can modulate the activity of Ang-II in the kidney, isolated resistance vessels, and cultured HRGEc. These findings clearly identify novel mechanisms by which heparin, acting alone or in combination with FGF-2, may affect the control of blood pressure, renal perfussion, and capillary permeability in critically ill children treated with ECMO and CPB.",

Many DNA damage genes, including ATM-related genes, were expressed less at mRNA and protein levels in both cell types. However, p53 expression decreased in HK-2 cells. Comet assays showed extensive DNA strand breaks in HuH-7 but not in HK-2 cells. ATM promoter activity increased in only HuH-7 cells. Also, S and G2/M populations were depleted by FACS in HuH-7 but not HK-2 cells. Conclusion: HK-2 cells transformed by HPV E6/7 oncogenes displayed independence from Cis-induced DNA breaks and ATMmediated cell cycle arrest.

The frequency of renal damage in infants undergoing resuscitation is high, but non-specific clinical symptoms and low information existing survey methods impede their timely diagnosis. Purpose -evaluation of diagnostic importance of determining the level of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) in the urine of newborns in critical states. Methods: We evaluated Human carbonic anhydrase IX in the urine of 40 newborns who had asphyxia at birth and receiving treatment in the intensive care unit -the main group. The control group consisted from healthy newborns (13 people). For the study used a sample of newborn urine collected at 1-2 days of age. Carbonic anhydrase was determined using enzyme immunoassay kit. Results: Human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) -trans membrane protein, the main physiological function of which is to regulate the pH by the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. The main pathogenic factor causing kidney damage of fetus is chronic fetal hypoxia. There is a single study HIF-I alpha (hypoxia inducible factor-I alpha) in the blood, increased expression of which occurs during hypoxia. This is connected with damage of tubules and interstitial cells of the kidneys, their proliferation, synthesis of cytokines and extracellular matrix. In this case, activity of CA9 is reduced in the blood. Normally, CA9 is missing in the urine, so its definition can be a marker of early renal dysfunction. The authentic increase of CA9 level in the main group was revealed in comparison with the control group ( and \u03b22-MG, 59,723/ 32,616/ 1511/ 996/ 1084/ 600 \u03bcg/g Cr.

Urinary \u03b11-MG levels reduced the quickest, and became the same as at >=3 years old by 6 months after birth. Conclusion: Renal tubular function can be evaluated in children <3 years old using these normal values. The most stable and useful marker from early infancy seems to be urinary \u03b11-MG.",

GM is nephrotoxic and may cause acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum creatinine (sCr) appears to be an insensitive and unreliable marker for detecting AKI. To determine whether urine biomarkers are useful for early detection of GM-induced AKI in neonates in the NICU. Methods: Prospective, clinical, observational study. Forty-six neonates (32M/14F) without pre-existent kidney disease were divided in a GM group (n=26) and a reference group (n=20). Demographics, vital signs and clinical conditions were recorded. Only neonates with a bladder catheter in place were included. Urine samples were collected every two hours. Biomarkers (GSTA1-1, GSTP1-1, KIM-1, NAG, NGAL) were determined. Residual blood samples were used to measure sCr. Results: The GM and reference group were comparable for gestational age, weight and mortality. Neonates treated with GM are admitted longer than neonates in the reference group. Treatment with GM resulted in higher sCr compared to the reference group (58. 5 [44.8-58.5] vs. 34.0 [28.3-58.8]; p<0.05). Higher levels of sCr correspond with higher urinary excretion of all biomarkers, especially in neonates treated with GM. The average time until the highest peak was shorter for all biomarkers compared with sCr (p<0.05). There was no difference in produced urine volume between the GM and the reference group. Conclusion: Higher sCr levels correspond with higher urinary excretion of all biomarkers, especially in neonates treated with GM. GSTP1-1 seems the most useful marker for early detection of AKI in neonates.",

Histological changes: with the formation of crescent in 10 cases, diffuse endocapillary proliferation in 5 example, 15 cases of renal tubular injury, 10 cases of red blood cell and protein cast, 1 cases with acute interstitial nephritis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed: with massive proteinuria were independent risk factors of IgAN in children with AKI (OR = 27.370, 95% confidence interval was 3.151-237.740, P<0.01). The etiology of AKI except with massive proteinuria, include: 1. IgA nephropathy with severe glomerular damage, including crescentic glomerulonephritis and diffuse endocapillary proliferation; 2 complicated acute interstitial nephritis; 3 drugs causing decreased glomerular filtration rate; 4. renal tubular injury induced by gross hematuria. All of the patients were not on dialysis, hormone therapy in 13 cases (including 7 cases of methylprednisolone pulse therapy), 6 cases combined with cyclophosphamide treatment. Except 1 cases no significant improvement, the renal functiones of all patients recovered or improved within 1-2 months after treatment. Follow-up from 1 month to 7 years, 3 cases had renal function improved, but 2 were lost to follow-up and after 3 years enter to the chronic renal failure, 1 case with renal function loss after 32 months and repeated renal biopsy showed glomerular sclerosis of 31.6% during the follow-up period. Conclusion: AKI is not uncommon in children with IgAN, the causes are varied and massive proteinuria is independent risk factor among them. We should adopt different treatment strategy according to different causes and the short term prognosis is good.",

Approximately 2-3% of children admitted to pediatric tertiary care centers present with this life-threatening condition. The most common causes are post-operative septic shock, organ or bone marrow transplantations and intrinsic renal disease. The latter comprises multiple disorders, but tumor invasion due to a lymphoproliferative malignancy is very exceptional. Methods and Results: We report two cases of AKI caused by infiltration of Burkitt's lymphoma. Both four-year-old male patients presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and overall weakness since a few weeks. Clinical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and impressive bilateral nephromegaly. Both had malignant hypertension. Blood analysis showed severe renal impairment in both patients. The first had creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (eGFR 21 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), urea of 97 mg/dL and uric acid of 8.9mg/dL. The second had creatinine of 5.97mg/dL (eGFR 10 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), urea of 215mg/dL and uric acid of 12mg/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase was extremely elevated in both cases (5860 U/L; 758 U/L respectively). Urinary sediment was normal. Ultrasound showed bilateral nephromegaly in both patients (Patient 1:+12SD and +11SD; Patient 2: +10SD and +9SD, for right and left kidney respectively). MRI demonstrated a homogenous renal enlargement with features of an infiltrative lesion. Bone marrow was inconclusive and diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was confirmed by a renal biopsy. After starting chemotherapy according to the Inter-B-NHL Ritux 2010 protocol, both children developed a tumor lysis syndrome and required hemodialysis. At last follow-up both children still had hypertension. Nevertheless, renal size and function were normalized. Conclusion: Lymphomatous infiltration due to Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare cause of AKI. However, it should be considered in a patient presenting with unexplained renal failure and bilateral nephromegaly with normal urinary sediment. Renal biopsy may be needed to confirm diagnosis.",

Methods: Prospective cohort study conducted on children. Outcome variables: mortality, need for dialysis, pICU free days (the number of days alive from ICU discharge to day 28) and ventilator-free days (the number of days alive and breathing without assistance from admission to day 28). Exposure variables: Malnutrition on admission (WHO growth standards) and any change in pRIFLE criteria during the first ICU 14 days. Results: Of 98 patients (median age =19 IQR =50 months, 35 girls) enrolled, 39 (40%) were malnourished and 34 (35%) developed AKI. Among the malnourished, 19/39 cases (49%) had AKI, while this complication occurred in 15/59 (25%) of patients without malnutrition resulting in a risk ratio of 1.9 (95%CI 1.1 -3.3). The 28 days mortality rate was 10/98 cases (10%) and AKI was associated with higher risk (8/34 versus 2/64 cases -RR=7.5 95%CI 1.7-33.5). Concurrent malnutrition and AKI was present in 19/98 cases (19%) producing a tendency (p=0.2) to a further increased risk of death (RR=9.4 95%CI 1.5-58.0). 9/98 (9%) patients needed dialysis and malnutrition increased the risk for this outcome (RR=5.3 95%CI 1.2-24.2). AKI was associated with significantly higher ICU free days (19\u00b17 vs. 15\u00b110) and ventilator-free days (22\u00b19 vs. 13\u00b112) but concomitant malnutrition did not reduce either of these outcomes. Conclusion: Malnutrition and AKI are common in children admitted to the ICU and the presence of malnutrition is associated with increased risk of developing AKI. The need for dialysis was increased in malnourished patients and more powered studies are demanded to test whether the tendency to higher mortality observed in patients with concomitant AKI and malnutrition is confirmed.",

Methods: An ongoing prospective observational study (Oct 2012-Mar 2012) of random urine ACR (mg/g) estimated on day1 and day 3 of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, of a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Demographic, laboratory data, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, outcome and PELOD scores were recorded. Results: Of 113 children, 72 children (median age 4.5years, 68% male) recruited. The commonest cause of admission was pneumonia, infection associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis followed by meningitis. Day1 ACR (median 70.8 mg/g) significantly correlated with day 3 total leukocyte count (P=0.016). Both day 1 and day 3 ACR correlated with PELOD scores [median 8] (P=0.002 & p= 0.003 respectively) and duration of mechanical ventilation (p=0.003 and p=0.001 respectively). Both median day 1 ACR, and day 3 ACR were significantly different between survivors (n= 29) and non-survivors (n=11) (p=0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively). ROC curve analysis for mortality prediction revealed the highest area under curve (AuC) of 0.963 for ACR3, followed by 0.928 for ACR1 and 0.867 for PELOD scoring (p>0.05, non-significant for AuC comparisions) (Fig. 1.) . A cut-off value of day 3 ACR of 102.4mg/g had a positive predictive value of 95.8% for negative outcome Conclusion: Microalbuminuria is an early inflammatory marker that correlates with organ dysfunction. Significant levels reliably predict negative outcome early into intensive care admission, as accurately as PELOD scores, which can help counsel patients, plan treatment and triage, and allocate resources judiciously.",

In the last category the majority of patients is female, the age of onset and time to ESRD is variable, although the vast majority of cases are older at presentation and time to ESRD is longer than in our case. Objective, Methods and Results: A 8-year-old girl, affected by b thalassemia major, was admitted for proteinuria detected at the emergency unit. Fever, hyporexia and diarrhea had been present in the last three days. On physical examination she presented with decreased skin turgor and hypertension. Laboratory examinations showed: hyponatremia (124 mEq/l), hypokalaemia (2.9 mEq/l), hypophosphatemia (1.1 mg/dl), hyperazotemia (60 mg/dl), reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl = 68 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and metabolic acidosis (HCO 3 -12.8 mmol/l). Urine analysis revealed: proteinuria, glycosuria, hypercalciuria, hyperuricuria, hyperphosphaturia and aminoaciduria. She had been under treatment for five years with Deferasirox (DFX) 26 mg/kg/die. We stopped DFX and gave supplementation of potassium, phosphate, sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride with electrolyte and renal function (CrCl 130 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) normalization in 6 days. After one month only minimal proteinuria persisted. Conclusion: In so far a Fanconi Syndrome (FS) has been reported in 11 patients (6 children), while mild renal insufficiency (RI) has been documented only in 2 children. In our case dehydration seems to be responsible for the RI, while an interstitial nephritis cannot be excluded. Close monitoring of renal function should be done in children on DFX. Objective: To test the hypothesis that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) are early biomarkers for AKI in critically ill patients and evaluate the predictive value of them in patients with established AKI at inception of CRRT. Methods: Children from PICU and health examination center in Guangzhou Women's and Children's Medical Center were divided into four groups: critically ill patients with AKI recevied CRRT group (group1 ), critically ill patients with non-AKI recevied CRRT group(group2) , critically ill patients with AKI don't recevie CRRT group (group 3),healthy control group (group4). 1.5 mL venous blood and Urine specimens were collected and was kept under -70\u00b0C.from each patient in PICU untill they were discharged, transferred or die . serum creatinine (Scr) and urine NGAL and urine IL-18 were analyzed . Results: Compared with group2 and group4, the urine NGAL and urine IL-18 increases obviously in group1 and group3 (P<0.05). There is no significance of urine NGAL and urine IL-18 between group2 and group 4.(P> 0.05).The concentration of urine NGAL increased more than10 times obviously 2 days before diagnosed of AKI under the AKIN standard with AUC 0.841(P <0.05) , and the concentration of urine IL-18 increased more than 5 times 2 day before AKI with AUC 0.808(P <0.05). The AUC was 0.943(P <0.01) when they were combined. The level of urine NGALand IL-18 at initiation of RRT were higher in in non-survivors compared to survivors. Conclusion: Urine NGAL and urine IL-18 are useful indicators to predict and early diagnose AKI. The level of urine NGAL and IL-18 at initiation of RRT.were negative correlation with the outcome of renal prognosis and survival rate . Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of early kidney injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Neutrophil gelatinase associated with lipocalin (NGAL) which can be measured both in serum (sNGAL) and in urine (uNGAL), is at the moment the most promising marker directed to discover early kidney injury within the glomeruli and distal and proximal tubules. Less known is cathepsine L as a marker of tubule necrosis. Methods: The study group consisted of patients (22 boys and 12 girls) with congenital heart disease. All patients were under 3 years of age (mean 8.2 months). Blood and urine samples were obtained during routine checkups. All patients had normal serum creatinine level at the day of collecting samples. The control group (n = 20) was age-and gender-matched. Levels of sNGAL, uNGAL and cathepsine were compared in whole group. The study group was divided depending on the nature of the defect (cyanotic/acyanotic) and the treatment (surgical/conservative treatment). Results: Chlidren with congenital heart disease had significantly higher concentration of sNGAL, uNGAL and urine cathepsine than the control group. No significant difference was observed in the urine cathepsine and urine and serum NGAL level between patients with acyanotic and cyanotic CHD. There were also no significant differences in patients who underwent surgery and on conservative treatment in NGAL level (both in urine and serum). Cathepsine level was significantly higher in group after surgical treatment. Conclusion: Patients with CHD are at higher risk of early kidney damage. This process is independent on the etiology and nature of the defect. NGAL determined in the serum and urine of these patients may be used to detect kidney injury or monitoring disease progression. Urine cathepsine is more efficient marker of early kidney injury in patients after cardiac surgery.",

T cell immunoglobulin-3 (Tim-3) plays a pivotal role in several inflammatory diseases by modulation of Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells. To detect the expression of Tim-3 in kidney mononuclear cells (KMNCs) from mice with renal IRI and analyze the relationship with Foxp3 + Tregs, to explore the role of Tim-3 in repair of renal IRI. Methods: The left renal pedicle was clamped in C57BL6 mice for 45 min, followed by reperfusion. Animals were sacrificed at baseline, day 1,3,10, 21 after IRI. Tim-3 expression in KMNCs were determined using real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The percentage of Foxp3 + Treg in CD4 + T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. The levels of TNF-\u03b1\u3001IFN-\u03b3\u3001IL-4 and IL-10 in kidney tissue were measured using ELISA. The correlation among Tim-3 expression, Foxp3 + Treg and cytokine level was analyzed.",

The percentage of Foxp3 + Treg in CD4 + T cells was up-regulated with time. Compared with the uninjured kidney, the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 increased significantly in the injured kidney at acute stage and the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 increased significantly in the injured kidney at repair stage. The Tim-3 expression in KMNCs at IRI repair stage was positively related with the level of Foxp3 + Treg, IL-10 (r=0.81, r=0.79 respectively; P<0. 05), but negatively related with the level of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Conclusion: The increased expression of Tim-3 in KMNCs may take part in the repair of renal IRI and contribute to the development of Foxp3 + Treg. Objective: (D+)HUS is a critical health problem in Argentina since it is the main cause of acute renal failure in children and the second cause of chronic renal failure. Fecal contamination of food and drinking water by asymptomatic cattle is often the source although secondary infection through personto-person contact may also occur. Occasionally in (D+) HUS, the onset among affected siblings occurred within a short time of each other. To evaluate the risk and clinical severity of illness for childhood (D+)HUS in siblings. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 133 children with D+HUS that were admitted in our pediatric department between March 1997 and December 2012. Results: (D+) HUS occurred in 2 siblings in 4 of the 129 families studied (3%). 16 patients had an affected sibling with diarrhea and 4 progressed to HUS (25%). Family cases: Mean age: 28 months, 5 were girls. The mean duration of interval between HUS episodes was 4 days. Second family members had prolonged oligoanuria (3 vs 12 days) and a most of them developed neurological complications. Long-term renal complications were more frequent in this group, but differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the potential for extensive intra-familiar transmission of STEC, especially between siblings.",

            "text": "Objective: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a common cause of systemic vasculitis in children. Other than well known complications like coronary artery aneurysm, there have been few reports of this disease involvement in renal system. According to the study from Wang JN et.al, 52% (26 out of 50) of the patients who suffered from KD showed renal inflammatory foci in DMSA renal SPECT which suggested a possibility of renal scar formation subsequent to KD. Therefore, this study was performed to verify the renal inflammation following KD. Methods: From March 2011 to October 2011, 15 patients who were diagnosed as KD at National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital were enrolled to the study. All of the patients underwent DMSA renal SPECT to evaluate renal involvement during their acute phase of KD. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac involvement such as coronary artery aneurysm. Complete blood cell counts, aspartate amino-transferase, alanin amino-transferase, albumin, c-reactive protein, and BUN/Creatinine were measured. Also Urine \u03b22microglobulin was measured to assess renal tubular function. Addition to fever of more than five days of duration, 4 of the following symptoms, rash, conjunctival injection, changes of lips or oral mucosa, erythema and swelling of hands and feet and cervical lymphadenopathy, was the diagnostic criteria for KD. Results: Among the 15 patients, 80% showed increased white blood cell s (WBC) and 47% showed elevated AST/ALT level. Serum albumin was below 4.0 g/dl in 93% of the patients. All of the patients presented normal renal function test. In urinalysis, hematuria and pyuria were observed in 13% and 33% respectively. Echocardiography revealed coronary artery aneurysm in 33% of the patients. Urine \u03b22-microglobulin was elevated in 46%. Regardless abnormal findings in urinalysis and elevated \u03b22microglobulin, no significant findings were observed in DMSA renal SPECT. Conclusion: According to the study, mild abnormality in the urinalysis and elevated \u03b22-microglobulin were the only findings of renal involvement in KD. However there was no aggressive renal manifestation which could be detected in DMSA renal SPECT.",

            "text": "Objective: In this study, the question remains if NGAL is a culprit or only bystander in AKI due to sepsis in children. Methods: Twenty seven children, (M-17, F-10) admitted to Intensive Care diagnosed with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled in this study. The concentration of NGAL, protein C and S, Antithrombin III and basic parameters were measured in the plasma at diagnosis and after 10 days of treatment. Results: Mean creatinine concentration in septic children at admission was higher than in reference group (p <0.05). There was statistically significant difference in APTT, prothrombin time, prothrombin ratio, thrombocytes count, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure between study groups in first and after 10 days (p<0.005, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.05 respectively). The PC concentration in the septic patients was significantly lower than those of the references (p<0.0001), and during intensive 10 days treatment raised (p<0.01). Also protein S concentration rose during the treatment (p<0.005), and was lower in septic children then reference group (p<0.0001). NGAL concentration was significantly higher in study group on the admission day comparing with reference group (p<0.05). Plasma NGAL was correlated at admission and after 10 days of treatment with protein C (respectively: r=-0.48, p<0.00005; r=-0.53, p<0.05). Multivariate regression revealed that NGAL was significantly predicted by creatinine (\u03b2=0.39, p<0.01) and Protein C (\u03b2=-0.38; p<0.01), yielding a model R2 =0.34 (p<0.001). Conclusions: It is possible that kidney binding of pathogenic antibodies stimulates local expression of NGAL, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AKI. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of perinatal risk factors (PRFs) on serum NGAL level in term neonates. Methods: The study group consist of 62 term neonates with PRFs, and 14 healthy neonatescontrol group (CG). Serum NGAL (ELISA) was measured in samples of cord blood (cNGAL) and peripheral blood (pNGAL) taken within first 5 days of life, and stored in -80\u00b0C until ELISA procedure was performed. PRFs were divided into 3 groups: 1. pathology of pregnancy or mother: diabetes (D) n=23, infection (I) -elevated CRP or WBC n=20, positive vaginal culture (VC) n=21, hypertension (HT) n=7, others n=5; 2. labor pathology: instrumental delivery (ID) n=41, premature rupture of membranes, >6 hours (PROM) n=26, fetal distress (FD) n=26; 3. neonatal pathology: intrauterine infection (II) n=10, CAKUT n=5, perinatal asphyxia (PA) n=4. The results were shown as median; values of cNGAL, pNGAL were logtransformed before analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with t-student, MANOVA tests with help of Statistica 10. Statistical significance: p<0.05. Results: In 62 term neonates, median cNGAL was 117.69ng/mL vs 64.37ng/mL in CG. Mean log cNGAL was significantly higher (p<0.01) vs CG, pNGAL was NS. Mean log cNGAL correlated positively with mean log pNGAL (r=0.36, p<0.01). Univariate analyzes of log NGAL in neonates with chosen PRFs vs neonates without particular factor showed significantly higher (p<0.05) mean log cNGAL in ID and FD group (median cNGAL: 126.47 vs 67.50 and 122.30 vs 77.01ng/mL respectively), whereas in II group significantly higher were mean log cNGAL and mean log pNGAL (median cNGAL 209.69 vs 96.52ng/mL, pNGAL 457.35 vs 156.37ng/mL). Multivariate analysis showed that the impact of ID was significant in groups: D (F=9.84; p<0.002), I (F=4.56; p<0.04), PROM (F=6.01; p<0.02) and FD (F=5.36; p<0.02). Conclusion: 1. Intrauterine infection may have a significant influence on NGAL in cord and peripheral blood whereas fetal distress and instrumental delivery only in cord blood. 2. The instrumental termination of pregnancy has an import impact on NGAL level in cord blood of neonates whose mothers had diabetes or infection, with PROM or fetal distress. Objective: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common problem and associated with significant morbidity and mortality in neonates. Pediatric-modified RIFLE (pRIFLE) classification system was developed to standardize the definition of AKI in children. We aimed to evaluate the performance of pRIFLE score diagnosis, severity and prognosis of AKI in term and preterm neonates. Methods: In this retrospective study, charts of 820 patients who were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over a 4 year period were reviewed for development of AKI. A diagnosis of AKI was determined for 254 patients (30.9 %) according to the pRIFLE criteria Results: Of the 254patients included in this study, 101 of them were girls and 153-were boys. Mean age was 4.12days (min-max: 0-49), mean birth week was 33.6 \u00b15.1 weeks (min-max: 24-42), mean birth weight was 2166 \u00b1 1045 gr (min-max: 580-4600 gr), length of NICU stay was 37.3 \u00b1 33.5(min-max: 2-165days). Two hundred fifty four patients with AKI were classified according to pRIFLE criteria. Ninetyeight patients (38.5%) achieved an 'R' level of AKI severity, 86 patients (33.5%) an \"I\" level, 66 patients (26%) an \"F\" level, 4 patients (1,5%) an \"L\" level. The most common etiologies of AKI -were prematurity, congenital heart disease, hypoxic ischemic injury, sepsis and usage of nephrotoxic agents. Patients classified with a higher pRIFLE score had a longer NICU stay and required a greater number of mechanical ventilation (p<0.05). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was needed for 30 patients (11.8%). Mortality rate was 26% and all deceased patients were classified as pRIFLE 'I','F' or 'L',p < 0.05) Conclusion: Using pRIFLE criteria in neonates with AKI is an efficient way to assess the severity and prognosis of the disease. Objective, Methods and Results: I present a case of a 11 years albanian old boy, 25th centile of development. Presented with abdominal pain, vomiting. Four days after, was addmited in the surgery clinic for uregent apendicitectomy. WBC: 23.0, SE: 64/, BUN: 6.1, Cre: 60, urine: normal. After the intervention medications that were used were: Gentamycin, Metronidazol, Cephtriaxon, H2 blocators. Two days after he was better. Thereafter he had polyuria and frequent urinating. The fifth day he had oliguria to seventh day, when he couldn't urinate. Nativ Rtg of abdomen resulted normal. He was transferede to Pediatric clinic-Nephrology department as an Akute kidney injory. He looked very sick, consious, stratified tongue, ECG: 50b/min, BP: 115/60 mmHg, breathing sounds were normal, periferal edemas and cold extremities. Lab resultrs: Cre: 624, BUN: 16.6, K: 5.1, Na: 131, eGFR: 8.8 ml/min oer 1.73m2. Ultrasound resulterd with urinary stasis: hydronephrosis, huge bladder. First was suspected for acute obstruction and AKI couse of a medication. We changed a bladder cathether which we find out that was blocked and took out 2700 ml urine/24h. We Dialysed him for three days and cre was stabilized to 266, when we stoped dialyse. BP was stabile, his weight droped from 32kg to 27.5 kg. He had proteinuria 2 g/24 h. Schintigraphy was done (biopsy we couldn't do) and resulted: eGFR was 12% less than adecuat for age, suspected for Nephritis tubulointestialis. He had some toxoalergic exanthema spread to the body. Repeted US resulted with ascaridosis in the gallbladder, which was treated with Mebendazole and in the feces were found the parasites. Imune Ab were negativ, IgE: positive, periferal blood smear had eosinophils, wastage of Na and Mg with urine. Cre after four weeks was 58, BUN:5, negative proteinuria. No changes of uveitis in the eyes. Importance of this case is cause this is the first case in Kosova that was dialysed and has recovered and now is free of dialyse (all other cases have traveled abroad until then). Conclusion: We have to think for parasites as a cause of a Tubulointesticial Nephritis but also of a abdominal pain or fatigue. Surgery team should have a close cooperation with pediatricians, in order to identifye in time complications of the surgery.",

We hypothesize that 'physiological' oliguria in first 48 hours of life is mostly prerenal in origin related to poor fluid intake during transition and UO criteria should be applicable in the 1st 48 hours of life too. We aimed a) to investigate pattern of UO in babies admitted to NICU with underlying morbidity but regulated fluid intake versus roomed-in babies in postnatal ward on breastfeeds in first 48 hours of life; b) to relate UO till 48 hrs of life with development of AKI Methods: Prospectively timing of first void and 6 hourly UO from birth till 48 hours age was compared between consecutive postnatal ward and NICU admissions. Neonates with structural malformations and requiring ventilatory/vasopressor support were excluded. Outcomes-Primary : time of first void after birth Secondary: UO in 1st 48 hrs in relation to subsequent AKI Results: Amongst eligible 87 postnatal breastfed babies (mean bwt 2.86 Kg ; SGA 18; 27 LSCS born) and 110 NICU admissions (median birthweight 2.01 kg,mean GA 34 wks (26-43 wks); 67 prematures (10 < 30 wks); 82 SGA (6 ELBW) recruited after informed consent, first voiding was significantly earlier for NICU babies (Mean(95%CI) (hrs) Postnatal 4.12 (3.29, 4 .93) vs NICU 2.31 (1.50,3.12) hrs). Nonvaginal delivery(LSCS 3.00 (1.89,4.11) vs vaginal 4.68 (3.60,5.75 ) and normal birthweight (AGA 4.08(3.10, 5.06) vs SGA 4.22(2.81, 5.63) ) had a trend for earlier voiding. 80% babies voided within 6 hrs of birth -more in NICU babies (90.4% NICU vs 76.7% postnatal (p<0.004) (Fig) .Asphyxia with MAS in NICU and IUGR and poor feeding in postnatal ward had delayed first void beyond 12 hours. 6 postnatal and 7 NICU neonates anuric in 1st 6hrs met stage I AKIN creatinine criteria. 2 asphyxiated babies anuric beyond 12 hours in NICU developed Stage III AKI. Conclusion: 'Physiological' anuria in 1st 48 hrs of life is misnomer and is related to fluid intake. Most babies are nonoliguric by 6 h; anuria >12 h needs investigation. AKIN urinary criteria should be applicable in neonates.",

However, on admission to the hospital, it is difficult to distinguish DSS patients with ATN from patients with reversible prerenal causes that will respond to simple hydration. Our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of tubular injury in Dengue AKI is very limited that until it is sufficiently increased, therapeutic strategies will continue to fail.Therefore we sought to explore the limitations of serum creatinine in this setting. General objective is to determine the clinical and diagnostic factors which are predictive for the need for dialysis among DSS patients at PCMC. Specific objective is to determine if the following factors are predictive of the need for dialysis: decrease in estimated creatinine clearance by 75% or <35 ml/min/BSA with urine output of <0.3ml/kg/hr. X 24 hours or anuria of 12 hours, assess the usefulness of urinary sediment scoring (USS) in predicting the need for dialysis, Methods: This retrospective study covered 60 newly admitted cases of Dengue Shock Syndrome lll and lV at the Philippine Children's Medical Center between January 2010 to December 2011. Results: Data from 60 patients were available for analysis. Comparison of the demographic characteristics between patients who required dialysis and those who did not showed no significant difference as proven by all p values >0.05. Of the differentclinical and laboratory parameters, there was a significant difference in the HR, RR, O 2 saturation, bicarbonate and base excess as proven by all p values <0.05. The HR an RR were significantly higher among those who needed dialysis than those who did not O 2 saturation, bicarbonate and base excess were significantly lower among those who needed dialysis than those who did not. The estimated creatinine clearance was significantly lower among those who needed dialysis than those who did not. Urine sediment score (USS) \u22653 was significantly higher among those who needed dialysis than those who did not. Conclusion: Our data indicate that a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance by 75% or <35 ml/min/BSA with urine output of <0.3ml/kg/hr. X 24 hours or anuria of 12 hours is not predictive of dialysis among DSS-induced AKI as well as other clinical and laboratory indices. But rather, relatively lower serum creatinine level among DSSinduced AKI who needed dialysis is associated with greater urine sediment scorecompared with those who did not. A USS \u2265 3 correlated with ATN and was predictive of early dialysis.However, estimated crea < 50 is the only factor predictive of dialysis, since this is the only one that was positive after logistic regression.",

However, in the setting of AKI, there is a paucity of prospective data on FGF23, especially in the pediatric population. Thus, we prospectively measured FGF23 levels in pediatric patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and assessed the ability of FGF23 to predict AKI. Methods: Pediatric patients, age newborn to 21 years, without underlying CKD, undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB were eligible for the study. Plasma FGF23 levels (2nd generation Cterminal, Immunotopics) were measured pre-operatively and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-reperfusion. Serum creatinine was obtained at baseline and daily post-reperfusion. AKI was defined by the AKIN criteria, estimated GFR was calculated using the Schwartz formula, and cardiac surgery complexity was classified via RACHS-1 score. Results: Of the 20 enrolled patients, 13 developed at least Stage 1 AKI. Gender, weight SDS, height SDS, baseline eGFR, cardiac surgery complexity, and CPB duration did not differ between the AKI group and the non-AKI group. Patients who developed postoperative AKI were younger than those who did not. Preoperative FGF23 levels were inversely related to age (r = -0.67, p = 0.001). Pre-operative FGF23 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed AKI than in those who did not; this remained significant upon correcting for age. Post-operatively, FGF23 levels increased in all patients. Conclusion: Pre-operative FGF23 levels predict the development of post-operative CPB-associated AKI. FGF23 levels increase in non-CKD patients undergoing CPB, even in patients without significant changes in serum creatinine, suggesting that FGF23 may be a more sensitive marker of AKI than serum creatinine.",

We aimed to determine the frequency, etiology, clinical course and mortality of AKI in a third level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: Medical records of all patients admitted to a NICU in western Turkey during 2007-2011 were evaluated and those having AKI within 0-30 days of life were determined. Birth weight, gestational age, mode of delivery, gender, maternal morbidity, hospitalization period, accompanying morbidities and mortality of all patients; and primary disease causing AKI, highest serum creatinine and prognosis of patients with AKI were recorded. Results: There were 677 patients (M/F:392/285) and 94 (13,9%) had AKI of which 80% developed during 0-7 days of life mostly due to birth asphyxia, hypovolemia, cardiac disease, sepsis and urinary system anomalies.

Mortality tended to increase in the presence of AKI independent on the underlying cause, but this was significant only for sepsis (33, 3% vs 5, 9%, p<0, 001; OR 7, 9) and cardiac diseases (50,0 %vs 15,0%, p=0,001; OR 5, 6) . Hospitalization period was increased if AKI was present (39,1 vs 20,5 days, p<0,001). Serum creatinine in deceased patients with AKI was higher than those who survived (2,0 vs 1,6 mg/dL, p<0,05). Chronic kidney disease was developed in 6 (10%) patients of whom 3 had urinary tract anomalies and 3 had birth asphyxia. Conclusion: AKI incidence in NICU was 14%, and 80% of AKI developed during the first week of life. AKI is associated with low birth weight, prematurity, birth asphyxia, sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiac diseases and urinary tract anomalies. Mortality in patients with AKI is increased independent on the birth weight, gestational age and underlying etiology. Objective: Cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the antineoplastic agents widely used for solid tumors in adults and children. An excessive dose due to medical error causes severe nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and myelosuppression. Previous reports described the effects of plasma exchange, sodium thiosulfate, N-acetylcysteine and other interventions. However, the strategy for over-dose patients, as regards the selection or intensity of therapies and the target of cisplatin removal, remains uncertain in children.",

Next, we administered chemotherapy mainly using CDDP. However, she developed renal insufficiency and hearing loss on the fourth day. We then realized that we had been administering CDDP 90 mg/m 2 for 4 days, instead of the intended 1 day. We promptly discontinued the CDDP and began plasma exchange and sodium thiosulfate administration. Nonoligiric renal failure was confirmed by a urea nitrogen value of 63.6 mg/dL and creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL. With 4 cycles of plasma exchange and 2 weeks of sodium thiosulfate, renal function improved and the CDDP concentration decreased from 6.04 to 0.99 mg/mL. After 1 month, the concentration was 0.34 mg/mL. We switched from CDDP to carboplatin, and chemotherapy was continued for 4 courses and then radiation therapy was added. Ultimately, she had mild renal insufficiency and moderate hearing loss. We evaluated the relationship between renal function and the CDDP concentration. Severe renal failure and hyponatremia were observed at a CDDP concentration of 1 mg/mL or more. Creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was maintained at a CDDP concentration below 0.5 mg/mL. Conclusion: In children with a CDDP over-dose, plasma exchange and sodium thiosulfate administration are effective. Also, monitoring of CDDP concentrations is recommended in patients with acute renal failure. In over-dose patients, early severe renal failure can be prevented when the CDDP concentration is reduced to less than 0.5 mg/mL with these therapies.",

Hemolytic uremic syndrome was the most common cause of AKI (36.8%), followed by septicemia (24.6%) and acute tubular necrosis (19.3%). Treatment with PD was highly effective in lowering retention markers (blood urea decreased by 40% and serum creatinine by 34% during the course of dialysis therapy, both trends significant at p < 0.001). Overall mortality was 36.8%. Deaths occurred 2-7 days after hospitalization. Significantly higher proportion of non-survivors had fluid overload (66.7% vs 25%, p= 0.002) and septicemia (47.6% vs 11.1% , p< 0.001) than survivors at presentation. The risk of mortality by multivariate analysis was higher when patients were anuric [Odds ratio (OR) 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-49, p<0.05), had septicemia (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.55-25.8, p<0.05), or severe infectious complications (OR 8.2, 95% CI 1.5-42.9, p<001). Conclusion: Because of its simplicity and feasibility, acute PD is still an appropriate treatment choice for children with AKI in resource-poor settings. Septicemia and severity of AKI are contributory factors to high mortality in pediatric acute kidney injury.",

Based on the data from 12 patients currently under follow up (for 12-62 months, mean 41 months), 32 (84%) children have recovered completely and 5 have developed CKD; stage I in 2 and stage II in 3. Conclusion: Prognosis following AKI was excellent in our patients, probably because of lack of multiorgan dysfunction. HUS was the commonest cause and urgent renal imaging needed when obstruction is suspected. Oliguric patients are more likely to require dialysis and need early referral to the regional unit. All cases should have long-term follow up to ensure renal recovery and detect delayed complications.",

All patients were followed up at least for a year and further monitoring continued until their renal function normalised and any proteinuria or hypertension resolved. Methods and Results: Stx-HUS was the commonest cause of AKI in our unit, accounting for 15 of the total 38 cases (39.5 %) treated for AKI during this period. 11 patients were less than 10 years of age. All children presented with blood in stool and 11 with oligoanuria. All showed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Positive stool cultures (for Ecoli 0157) were obtained in 11 and 4 had Ecoli 0157 lipopolysaccharide serum antibodies. 10 patients required dialysis (peritoneal dialysis in 7, haemodialysis in 1 and both modes in 2) and one child needed plasma exchange. The remaining responded to supportive management. Morbidities encountered included bowel perforation (1), hypertension (2), seizures (2) and diabetes mellitus (1) and three of these children needed intensive care management. At discharge there were no deaths, none with dialysis dependency or complete renal recovery but all showing improving renal function. At 3 months we found normal renal function in 12 (80%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage II in 2 and CKD stage III in 1. A 13 year old girl with an unknown myopathy presented for the third time with clinical and laboratory features of rhabdomyolysis. On day two of admission, her renal function deteriorated with decreased urine output, increasing creatinine of 380 \u03bcmol/l and CK of 240,220 IU/l. She was commenced on haemodialysis and started on calcium supplements, as her calcium levels were 1.6 mmol/l. Three week into her illness, she was symptomatic with high blood pressure of 170 mm of Hg leading to a generalised seizure. Her serum calcium was 4.01 mmol/l. The CT brain did not reveal any evidence of haemorrhage or infarction. There were no other trigger factors identified for the seizure and the hypertension, apart from the hypercalcaemia. The hypercalcaemia was managed with low calcium dialysate, calcitonin and Sevalamer. Despite the above treatments, she continued to be hypercalcemic and developed erythematous palms and soles and an injected conjunctiva. In view of the refractory hypercalcaemia, She received two doses of intravenous Pamidronate (0.5 -1 mg/kg) when the creatinine was 317 mmol/l. Following this, her calcium levels normalised to 2.59 mmol/l. Her renal function improved and was discharged a week later. There was no nephrocalcinosis seen on follow up. Bisphosphonates are used in children with caution, as there is little evidence on its safety and efficacy. They act by binding to the surface of calcium phosphate crystals and inhibiting osteoclast formation, aggregation and dissolution. It is nephrotoxic causing acute tubular necrosis and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Pamidronate is usually used in children with chronic kidney disease but this was the first time it was used in a child recovering from acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis. There were no complications with the use of pamidronate in our patient.",

Since childhood is the special life stage with continuous growth, clinical features are different from the adult and changes were happened in resent years. The change rules, clinical features, treatments and the outcomes of acute pediatric poisonings inpatients were investigated in this article. Methods: Retrospective evaluated the 1005 cases of pediatric acute poisonings admitted to the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Cases were divided into 5 groups by ages, or divided into 2 groups based on different origins (urban or suburban), different causes and routes of poisonings in different groups were calculated. The clinical manifestations, treatments and prognosis in acute intoxication were also studied. Results and Conclusion: Pediatric acute poisoning mainly happened in 1-4 years old children (50.02%), there was no statistical difference between genders. The common causes of poisonings were pharmacological poisoning (26.07%), food poisoning (19.50%), animal bites and stings (16.92%) and pesticide poisoning (14.73%). In the resent five years, Pharmacological poisoning rose to be the top reason of poisonings, and was mainly composed by children\u22643 years old (P < 0.001),and urban children were more than children from suburban(P < 0.001). Neurological and psychiatric drugs were the most common (32.06%) in drug poisoning. Rural children with animal bites and stings, pesticide poisonings and rodenticide poisonings were more than the urban children (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.05). The main poisoning causes in 6-12 years old group and >12 years old group children were food poisoning (29.20%) and pesticide poisoning ( Objective: Little is known about cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) in children in developing regions of the world.",

CS-AKI was associated with 2-3 days longer duration of mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and ICU stay. Conclusion: CS-AKI occurs in children in developing countries but at a lower frequency mainly due to older children with less complex congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. CS-AKI was associated with higher in-hospital mortality and increased utilization of hospital services. Factors associated with CS-AKI included intra and post-operative hypotension and sepsis.",

At time of discharge from hospital proteinuria remained in 53 (85.5%), hypertension -in 47 (75.8%) patients. After 1 year, 5years and >10 years period proteinuria was detected accordingly to 26.3-7.9-33.3%, hypertension to 11.3-6.5-12.9% of patients. After >10 years from the onset of disease hypertension was detected more often in the group of children who were < 1 years old on acute phase of the disease (40% vs 11.1%, p=0.05). In the group of patients who hadn't proteinuria on the acute phase, after >10 years period proteinuria was observed to 25% of them. After 1 year period renal impairment of various degree was observed to 26.3%, after 5 years -to 39.5 %, after >10 years-to 33. . On admission his mean arterial pressure was 35 mmHg, his creatinine was 5.8, potassium 6.5 and sodium 121. Usual medical management for AKI was initiated but even by late D5 he continued to be anuric with a rising creatinine. His uric acid was grossly elevated at 14 mg/dl. Dialysis was considered but as the parents were not in favour of it they were offered the option of rasburicase. Rasburicase was given on late D5 and within 12 hrs he started to produce urine which peaked at 4 ml/kg/hr by D9. The creatinine also showed a concomitant fall and by discharge (D10) it was 2.1 mg/dl and normalized at 0.5 mg/dl by D30. Uric acid was 0.5 mg/dl on D7 and 2.8 mg/dl on D9. Case 2: 6 years old boy with multiple special needs was transferred from another hospital intubated, anuric and in multi organ failure (MOF). Creatinine was elevated at 3.7 mg/dl and uric acid was also found to be raised at 9.1 mg/dl. In view of MOF along with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC) dialysis was considered a risky process and parents were offered the option of rasburicase. Rasburicase was given on D2 of admission and although the repeat uric acid was 0.3 mg/dl and he did produce 5 ml of urine within 6 hours no further improvement in renal parameters was noticed. Dialysis (SLED) was initiated on D3. Although the creatinine improved with SLED he continued to be oligo-anuric and died of MOF by D5. Conclusion: Although Rasburicase seemed to work in case1, it was not beneficial in Case 2. The exact mechanism for rasburicase is still hypothetical and the few case reports have all documented positive results. Although it seemed to have worked in Case 1, to the best of our knowledge case 2 is the first documented case wherein it did not work. Proper randomized control trial is needed before advocating rasburicase as a novel therapy for AKI. Results: Age, sex, diagnosis, baseline and post-surgery hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, platelet count and biochemistry were recorded. Baseline and post-operative, urea (mg/dl), creatinine (mg/dl), urine output (ml/kg/hr) and inotrope dose were also recorded daily. The duration of CPB was noted. Post-operatively cardiac, renal, hepatic, neurological and respiratory dysfunctions were recorded. Conclusion: Fifteen (7.2%) children developed AKI stage I, one child (0.5%) developed AKI stage II and four children developed AKI stage III (2%). All patients with AKI had a longer stay in hospital. Eight children required dialysis for AKI; two required dialysis to maintain the fluid balance post operatively. None developed chronic renal impairment. Using stepwise regression, younger age (<1 year), weight < 10Kg, pump failure, sepsis and duration of CPB more than 60 minutes were significant risk factor for developing AKI. Results: most of the patients were male, with less than 28 days old and weighing less than 5kg.In the majority of cases (77%), ARF was diagnosed in the first 6 days after surgery, demonstrating influence of the procedure itself. All of them were treated by peritoneal dialysis(PD) for a mean time of 255 hours; 58.3% of them died. There was no statistical significant difference between age, time on extracorporeal circulation and duration of dialysis, comparing the patients who survived and the deceased ones. Conclusion: Acute renal failure is a common complication in children with congenital heart disease and PD is a safe dialytic method. The mortality rate is high and influenced by aspects related to the child, underlying disease, type of surgery and many other associated aspects.",

Conclusion: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients with critical illness. The main causes associated to AKI were sepsis and shock. We found no association with cardiac surgery, probably explained by the low level of complexity that is performed in our center. Almost half of our patients with AKI were in Failure and the mortality was high as previously reported. Objective: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a phosphaturic hormone involved in calcium phosphate homeostasis, appears to predict renal disease progression in adults with non-diabetic CKD (Fliser, JASN 2007) . This study aimed to determine renal survival according to FGF-23 serum levels in children with CKD stage II-IV. Methods: 232 children participating in the ESCAPE trial (age 11.5\u00b14 yrs, GFR 45\u00b118 ml/min/1.73m 2 ; underlying renal disease: hypo/dysplasia (71%), glomerulopathies (12%), hereditary or other (17%)) were analyzed. All patients received fixed dose ACE inhibition and were followed prospectively by 2-monthly examinations for up to 5 years. The study endpoint was defined by eGFR loss >50% from baseline, GFR <10ml or start of renal replacement therapy. FGF-23 levels were determined at baseline (C-terminal human FGF-23 ELISA (Immutopics, San Clemente,CA,USA Objective: The long-term outcome of patients born with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) and of those who underwent therapeutic unilateral nephrectomy (UN) remains a topic of concern and debate. Children with a solitary functioning kidney (SFK) have an increased risk of developing hypertension, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease in later life. The purpose of this study was to identify whether plasma symmetric dimethylarginine (pSDMA) is an useful biomarker reflecting the level of renal injury in children with solitary functioning kidney (SFK). Methods: We measured circulating pSDMA in 51 patients with SFK and no other urinary defects. Patients were subdivided for two groups: primary SFK (pSFK)-unilateral renal agenesis (URA) and secondary SFK (sSFK) after unilateral nephrectomy. The control group (C) consisted of 21 healthy children, aged mean 9.92 \u00b1 4.85 yrs. Immunoenzymatic ELISA commercial kits was used to measure pSDMA concentration. Data analysis was performed using computer program Statistica 9.0. Results: The age and sex of studied children did not differ from healthy controls (p> 0.05). Plasma SDMA levels in SFK children were higher than in healthy participants (p< 0.05). There was no difference in pSDMA concentrations between pSFK and sSFK patients (p> 0.05). SDMA plasma levels correlated significantly with C cr (r= -0.32, p< 0.01) in all participants. ROC analyses performed in order to define the diagnostic efficiency of serum creatinine and pSDMA in identifying children with C cr < 90ml/ min/ 1.73m 2 among SFK and healthy participants revealed no difference between all two AUCs (p> 0.05).",

High turnover bone disease with hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism and hypocalcemia was the most frequent type of MBD in stage I-IV CKD and ESRD patient. Adynamic bone disease was seen in only one ESRD patient. Hypophasphatemia was the most common disorder in renal allograft recipients. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was seen in 55% of stage I-IV CKD, 65% of ESRD patients and all renal allograft recipients. All patients with stage I-IV CKD and ESRD were treated with calsitriol and renal allograft recipients were treated with vitamin D3 supplementation. Conclusion: Mineral and bone disorders especially high turnerover type is common in children with CKD and ESRD. Although successful kidney transplantation corrects many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with the development of MBDs, renal allograft recipients had increased risk of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Objective: Calciphylaxis is a complication of chronic kidney disease that characterized by necrotic lesion in the skin and in histological examination reveals microcalcification of medium sized blood vessels. Materials and Methods: We report on a 21-month old girl with end stage renal disease due to diffuse mesangial sclerosis referred for Tenckhoff catheter implantation. Laboratory tests on admission were: BUN = 150 mg/dl, Cr= 5 mg/dl, uric acid = 10 mg/dl, calcium= 4 mg/dl, phosphate = 40 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase= 1017, PTH= 700 pm/l,VITD= 21 mg/ml. Calciphylaxis process started when she received calcium gluconate IV the day before surgery and continued progressively when oral calcium carbonate and oral calcium gluconate were given. Hourly peritoneal dialysis was started and all calcium containing medications were stopped. But the process continued progressively. Surgical detriment of the necrotic tissue of right wrist was done. Comfeel dressing had no effect and the circulation of tissue was poor. Therefore the left wrist was kept as control. Pamidronate 0.5 mg/kg/day prescribed for 6 days and then once a week for 5 weeks. After one week of starting pamidronate skin lesion began to heal, circulation improved and after six weeks all skin lesions completely recovered. As shown in figure one debridement cause skin scar on right wrist. Conclusion: Pamidronate is effective to stop calciphylaxis in children with advance renal insufficiency and severe calcium-phosphate imbalance. Medical or surgical debridement are not suggested and lesions will recover without scar by pamidronate Objective: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key player in kidney-bone axis and regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis.

The FGF23 levels were found to be lower than reports in the literature. Whether it can be attributed to the dietary differences from the children of the west needs further investigation. Testing of the entire cohort will reveal if this lower FGF23 is a universal phenomenon among all children in our study. On the contrary, all DXA parameters showed a decreased in their mean Zscore BMD values that reached statistically significance. Finally, multivariate stepwise regression analyses showed that estimated glomerular filtration rate at the beginning of the study was the best predictor of the difference in BMD Z-scores measured at lumbar spine. Additionally, values of iPTH at the beginning of the study and the change of iPTH throughout the study predicted the 72.3% of the difference in Z-score of SOS measured at radius with an inverse relationship. Conclusion: The use of two different techniques have shown bipolar changes of bone properties after renal transplantation. Reversal of renal osteodystrophy and consequently correction of many of the underlying metabolic abnormalities, mainly normalization of iPTH, strengths cortical bone as this is best illustrated by QUS assessment. However, reduction in BMD, is predominantly considered as an adverse effect of steroid immunosuppression. age 3.3 yr) (group 1), 33 patients with CKD stage 5 on PD or Hemo (mean age 9 yr, mean time on dialysis 2 yr) (group 2) and 29 patients with CKD stages 2-4 (mean age 7 yr, mean GFR 37 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (group 3). 25OHD levels were deficient in 20% and insufficient in 35% of the group 1 patients, 48% were deficient and 15% were insufficient in group 2, and 7 % were deficient and 17% were insufficient in group 3. Results: Intact PTH (iPTH) was above the target level by different CKD stages in 52 % of the group 1 patients, in 58% of the group 2 and in 52% of the group 3 and showed an inverse correlation with 25OHD levels (p<0.05, r=\u22120.25). There was inverse correlation with age in the complete cohort of patients (p=0.0005, r =\u22120.33) Height standard deviation score (SDS) was associated with 25OHD only in group 2 (p=0.025, r=0.45). There was direct correlation between 25OHD levels and GFR in group 1 and 2. Conclusion: Our data suggest that 25OHD deficiency is common in pediatric renal transplant and CKD children of any stage even in an area with year-long sunshine, especially in adolescents. Hyperparathyroidism was also frequent in all groups. It would be advisable to monitor vitamin D status in these patients. 3) years, 28 with CKD 5 (2 on HD, 9 on PD and 17 Tx) mean age 13 (5.4-17.5) and 113 healthy children, mean age 11.5 (5-17.9 Objective: The aim of our study was to analyze twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of gene LRP5 potentially associated with osteoporosis risk in children with routine steroidotherapy in the course of the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Methods and Results: Glucocorticosteroids are important risk factors for drug induced osteoporosis. Decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk for pathological fractures are caused by direct division of steroids at the cellular level by inhibiting the replication of osteoblasts and stimulation of its apoptosis. Also proven its effects on the inhibition of type I collagen synthesis. LRP5 is one of the Wnt signaling pathway proteins coreceptors involved through the RANK-RANKL system in regulation of the osteoblasts function. LRP5 is included to the osteoporosis phenotype genes group and its selected single nucleotide polymorphisms can be responsible for BMD decrease in patients with glucocorticoid therapy. The study group was composed of 38 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, 21 boys and 17 girls beetwen the age of five to twelve years old , 14 with osteoporosis and 24 with normal bone mass density. Study also included the control group consists of 102 healthy individuals at the same age not treated with glucocorticoids. The analysis was carried out with polimerase chain reaction (PCR) and TaqMan molecular probe designed for 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) nearby investigated mutations in LRP5 gene that can be connected with osteoporosis fenotype. Odds ratio value (OR) was based on frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in LRP5 gene and its haplotype analysis.",

Objective: Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factors are essential for normal growth and development. Chronic renal failure (CRF) results in major changes in the circulating growth hormone /insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. Our aim isto study: To assess clinical and laboratory parameters of growth and osteodystrophy including IGF1 and IGFBP2 as part of the somatotropic hormone axis in Egyptian children suffering from CRF on conservative therapy. Methods: 62 Egyptian children (47 boys and 15 girls) with a mean age of 9.7y (0.47 to 21.12y) suffering from CRF on conservative therapy and 21 controls were included in the study. Ht, wt and TSF were measured ,pubertal staging was assessed and followed up for a period of 6 months. At the end of the follow up period serum for IGF1 and IGFBP2, renal function, electrolytes, Ca, P ,and alkaline phosphatase and acid base balance were measured and an X-ray of the left hand and wrist was done to determine their bone age by Tanner and Whitehouse. Results: Our study shows that Children suffering from CRF in Egyptian conservative therapy have growth retardation with a mean ht of -3.7 SDS, a mean wt of -2.24 SDS. TSF mean was -1.3 SDS. On the average the patients had a delay of 2.95y (+/-2.0) in their bone age. Their height was retarded more than their bone age with a height age/bone age of 0.8 (+/-0.18). Alkaline phosphatase as a markers of renal osteodystrophy is significantly correlated to the height, height age , bone age and to the pH. The mean IGF1SDS (-0.6 +/-1.8) did not differ from that of controls while the mean IGFBP2SDS (2.4 +/-4.6) was significantly higher in patients with CRF than in controls. Height and weight were significantly correlated to IGF1 but not IGFBP2. There is a significant correlation between IGFBP2 level and the glomerular filtration rate. Conclusion: The imbalance between normal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and markedly increased IGFBP2 plasma levels plays a pathogenic role for growth retardation in children with chronic renal failure. The lower the GFR the higher the IGFBP2 level. The latters inhibitory action may provide hope for improving growth in cases of CRF by reducing the level of IGFBP2 or displacing IGF1 from it. Objective: Anemia is one of the most common complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal transplantation.

Anemia was defined according to K/DOQI guidelines as Hb is less than the fifth percentile of the normal, adjusted for age and sex. Results: During the study period52.3% of stage I-IV CKD, 100% of ESRD patients and 48.1% of renal allograft recipients developed anemia. The mean Hb levels were 11.30+/-1.72 g/dl, 9.62+/-1.94 g/dl and 11.95+/-1.88 g/dl in stage I-IV CKD, ESRD patients and renal allograft recipients, respectively. The mean Hb levels were significantly lower in ESRD patients as compared to stage I-IV CKD patients and renal allograft recipients (p<0.0081, p<0.002). Erythropoetine (EPO) deficiency was the most frequent cause of anemia in stage I-IV CKD and ESRD patients, followed by iron deficiency. In addition to EPO and iron deficiency, bone marrow suppression and parvovirus infection were the causes of anemia in renal allograft recipients. Erythropoietic stimulating agents were used in 27% of stage I-IV CKD, 100% of ESRD patients and 23% of the renal allograft recipients. Conclusion: Although anemia is one the most common problems seen in children with CKD and ESRD, the prevelance is also high in renal allograft recipients.

Treatment with exogenous GH has been accepted as standard therapy in children with CKD and short stature. However, concerns have been raised in the past on the potential fibrogenic effects of GH. There is no information regarding renal GHR signaling pathway in CKD. Methods and Results: To investigate this pathway, surgically 5/6 nephrectomized (CKD) and pair-fed control (C) juvenile (3 wk old) rats were sacrificed after 2 weeks of CKD. Serum creatinine and albumin excretion were significantly elevated (associated with glomerulomegaly and early fibrosis) while body weight and length gain were reduced in CKD rats. Serum IGF-I levels were decreased in CKD, even though serum GH levels were unchanged. Kidney GHR mRNA and protein levels were reduced and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5 was significantly impaired. Supressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) mRNA was increased in association of increase in renal IL6 mRNA. Renal IGF-1 mRNA was unaltered in CKD. Thus, in the remnant kidney of CKD growth retarded juvenile rats there is impaired GH mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling. This defect may be due to a reduction in GH receptor expression and signaling together with an increase in SOCS3 expression. Conclusion: We suggest that the insensitivity of the remnant kidney to GH may serve to protect against the potential adverse renal effects of exogenous GH in CKD patients. Objective: Concerns have been raised about possible adverse effects of growth hormone(GH) in short children with chronic renal diseases. Six cases of short children with chronic renal diseases CKD were studied in our hospital, the microalbuminuria as a sensitive parameter of early glomerular damage was detected during the treatment of recombinant human growth hormone. The individual growth response to GH was also observed. Methods: Of the 6 cases, male were 4 , female 2, the onset age ranged from 4 to 14 years old, all were diagnosed as growth retarded children with various chronic renal diseases. The dosage of GH was 0.1 IU/kg/d. The follow-up period was from 3 months to 1years. Microalbuminuria was measured by a commercially available ELISA kit, as a sensitive parameter of early glomerular damage in children being treated with recombinant human growth hormone. Serum insulin-like growth factor IGF-I concentration and IGFBP3 were also measured before and during the treatment with GH.",

Antihypertensive therapy associating minoxidil, labetalol, amlodipine and lasilix were not able to control adequately blood pressure. Due to massive kidney enlargement, inadequate respiratory function and inability to tolerate enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition was initiated at 2 months to maintain adequate calories intake. At 4 months of life, the infant presented severe viral pneumonia complicated by cardio respiratory arrest . He required cardio respiratory resuscitation and hospitalization in ICU for several days. Unilateral right nephrectomy was decided after this severe complication in order to avoid similar accidents due to massive kidney volume and to improve respiratory and nutrition status. One week after unilateral nephrectomy, we noted rapid increase volume of the left kidney and important ascitis having the biological characteristics of portal hypertension. Repeated aspiration of more than 100 ml of portal ascitis was performed every day. In parallel daily perfusion of albumin for more than 3 weeks and complete parenteral nutrition did not succeed in treating ascitis. Faced to resistant ascitis and persisting difficulties in maintaining enteral nutrition and adequate respiratory ventilation , left nepherctomy was decided and performed. Automated peritoneal dialysis was rapidly initiated in our anuric infant (weight after binephrectomy4kgs).

The objectives were to estimate the serum hepcidin 25 in children with chronic kidney disease stage II to IV and correlate it with hemoglobin, iron status (serum ferritin and transferrin saturation), inflammation (C reactive protein) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Methods: It was a cross sectional study. Children aged 2 to 18 years with CKD stage 2-4 on stable dose of iron and or erythropoetin for the last 4 weeks were included. Children with anemia due to other causes, severe acute infection, chronic cardiac or respiratory conditions and those who received parenteral iron and or blood transfusion in last 4 weeks were excluded. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, C reactive protein were assessed. Serum hepcidin 25 levels were estimated using a ELISA based kit in the cohort as well as in 15 age and sex matched normal children to estimate the levels in normal population. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between hepcidin and hemoglobin, iron status, inflammation and eGFR. Results: Forty children were recruited into the study. The mean age of children was 9.1+ 4.5 years. Around 30%, 28% and 42% of children had CKD stage II, III and IV respectively. The mean serum hepcidinlevels in children with CKD (55.87+14.27ng/ml) was significantly higher than controls (11.17+4.38ng/ml). Conclusion: Serum hepcidin levels showed an increasing trend with decrease in eGFR, but this was not statistically significant. The mean haemoglobin was 10.76+1.59g/dL, the mean ferritin was 43.27+38.3ng/ml , the mean transferrin saturation was 21.68+11.5%.

Objectives, Methods and Results: Presenting a 16-year old Armenian patient who developed a secondary amyloidosis on top of a familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and moved to Germany 4 years ago. At the time of the move the patient had already a terminal renal insufficiency and received intermittent hemodialysis. Despite the therapy with colchicine moderate attacks of the FMF occurred with an interval of 4 weeks and inflammatory parameters were permanently elevated. The dosage of colchicine was titrated up to 3 mg per day. As a consequence diarrhea occurred and the dosage had to be decreased. Over the course the amyloidosis progressed and affected all internal organs including heart and bowel. The combination of inflammation, uremia and amyloidosis led to malnutrition (BMI 14 kg/m2). At the age of 16 years the most severe colitis with peritonitis and paralytic ileus occurred. The treatment with colchicine was paused in assumption of a toxic effect. After improvement of the diarrhea but still persisting abdominal pain the colchicine treatment was slowly started again. Shortly afterwards a very severe attack of the FMF developed with an accompanied cardiovascular insufficiency. The treatment with a single high-dose of methylprednisolone and the inhibition of interleukin 1 with anakinra (1 mg/kg, given after dialysis) led only to a short remission. The high-dose methylprednisolone treatment was therefore repeated three times and anakinra was given on a daily basis. Since then no new attack of the FMF occurred and the combination of lowdose colchicine and anakinra improved the general status of the patient The elevated inflammatory parameters including serum amyloid A have almost normalized. Objectives: Invasive aspergillosis is almost exclusively occurs in immunocompromised hosts. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most frequent sites of invaziveaspergillozis after the lungs. We report a case of invasive Aspergillosis in a boy with end stage renal failure. Methods and Results: A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, fewer and cough. He suffered from chronic kidney failure (CRF) known for a year and he was on peritoneal dialysis for seven months. He was initially treated with iv. ceftriaxone for lobar pneumonia, intraperitonealceftazidime and cefazolin for peritonitis. The peritoneal fluid was also cultured for fungus and mycobacteria and all cultures were negative. On the seventh day, the patient complained for lower extremity weakness, and bilateral hyperactive deep tendon reflexes and positive babinski reflex were found. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal, but the spinal cord was compressed between C7-T5 by a solid mass which was originated from right lung on spinal MRI. Computed tomography-guided tru-cut lung biopsy was performed for the solid mass. Repeated peritoneal fluid culteres were also negative. Two days later, when unconsiousness and convulsions were seen, intraparenchymal multiple hemorrhagic abscesses were found on his second MRI. Typical hyphae of aspergillusfumigatus was present in pathologic specimens and galactomannan test was positive. Cerebral abscesses were evaluated as CNS involvement of invasive aspergillosis. Anti fungal therapy was began immediately as amphotericin B and caspofungin. The peritoneal catheter was removed and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was performed. However his condition kept deteriorating and death ensued on the fourth day of anti fungal therapy. Conclusion: Invasive Aspergillosis may rarely occur in immunocompetent patients and diagnosis may be missed or delayed due to lack of the particular clinical signs. We should be careful about diagnosis of fungal infections in patients with CRF since early treatment before the invasion and dissemination of aspergillosis to adjacent tissues and/or organs offers a higher survival chance for the patient.",

We could not find any correlation between BMI, and gender, post-transplant follow-up, duration of CRF, primary disease, donor status and graft loss. In the first year of transplantation, GFR was significantly lower in obese patients than non-obese recipients (p<0.05) Conclusion: Our data has suggested that, even within its normal range, elevated serum GGT concentrations and hyperlipidemia are closely associated with obesity in transplanted patients and obesity has negative effects on graft functions.",

Everolimus was initiated after 3 months in 5 patients due to 1 chronic CNI nephrotoxicity, 2 chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) and 2 unfavorable graft functions with history of delay graft function. Median duration from transplantation to CNI conversion was 4.5 months (range 0.8-88) and median time from conversion to the last follow-up was 8 months (range 2-26). Mean creatinine clearance (CrCl) prior to the CNI elimination was 33.0\u00b113.2, as compared to mean CrCl of 49.0\u00b116.3 ml/min/1.73m 2 at last follow up (p =0.069). Three patients had acute rejection (AR) before the conversion, but only 1 patient had AR post CNI elimination. There were no patients with graft loss or CNI-elimination failure. Conclusion: Conversion from CNI to everolimus was safe without increasing risk of acute rejection in pediatric kidney transplant patients who experienced early and late CNI associated complications. Objective: Due to a severe shortage of suitable deceased-donor kidneys for children awaiting kidney transplants (KT), we have performed a series of ABO-incompatible (ABO-i) living KT since 1989. Historically, ABO-i KT was performed using several session of plasmapheresis (PP) to remove existing anti-A or anti-B antibodies, followed by splenectomy to prevent rebound of antibodies. Because splenectomy had risks of surgical complications including bleeding and pancreatic pseudocyst, we introduced a new protocol, for ABO-i KT, in January 2006. The new protocol without splenectomy utilizes the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) and PP. This study retrospectivery examined the efficacy and safety of this protocol. Methods: Eight de novo ABO-i KT (5 males and 3 females) were performed between January 2006 and December 2012. The mean age at transplantation was 15.3\u00b14.0 years (range 9.9-20.5 years). The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of cyclospolin or tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. All patients received induction therapy with basiliximab. The preconditioning protocol included PP or double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) and a single dose of rituximab (average dosage 179 mg/m 2 ). All patients who underwent KT achieved a isoagglutinin titer less than 1:16 with 1-4 sessions of PP/DFPP treatment before transplant.",

One non-adherent patient experienced antibody mediated rejection. Figure1 ). In the RTR who had graft loss, there was no significant difference in graft survival time (6.0, 3.1 years, DSA negative vs DSA positive), Grade 1 rejection (0.5, 0.7 episodes per patient), Grade 2 rejection (0.5, 0.7 episodes per patient) or C4d staining (100%, 57% patients). One patient in each group had BK virus associated nephropathy. Two patients had plasma cell infiltrates on biopsy and lost their grafts within 6 months of DSA detection. Results: Fifty-one kidney recipients (male 32 cases; female 19cases) were enrolled in this study. The median age was 15 years, the youngest kidney recipient was 3years old with a body weight of 10.0kg). There were 11 recipients less than equal 10 years, including one children with congenital renal dysplasia and one with congenital renal artery malformation. About 73.7% kidney recipients came from GuangdongProvince. About 1 to 7 pediatric patients accepted renal transplatation each year from 2003 to 2011, but there were13 in2012, which showed a significant increase than in each previous sigle year.The policy that children had a kidney recipients priority may contribute to this increase. The kidney donors were cadaveric kidneys(72.5%) and living kidneys(27.4%), only one patient accepted auto-renal-transplatation. All kidney recipients were survival to present with the treatment of glucocorticoid and or immunosuppressants,such as CsA, FK506, MMF,ect. Only two patients accepted retransplatation due to losing function of the renal grafts. Conclusion: Renal transplantation in children increased significantly in 2012 in our hospital, and it seemed an effective treatment to children with ESRD. Recent adult studies have shown that low levels of immunosuppression (IS) are associated with dnDSA. However, limited data is available on significance of dnDSA and its management in paediatric population. To assess relationship between dnDSA with renal function, histological findings, immunosuppression levels and graft outcome in paediatric renal transplant recipients (RTR). In our centre, at the time of the study, DSA were tested if deterioration in graft function was found necessitating renal biopsy. Methods: Retrospective review of all RTRs in a single tertiary nephrology centre tested for dnDSA. Data collected included dnDSA, histological findings, eGFR as marker of renal function, baseline immunosuppression, subsequent treatment and outcome. Results: 27/88 patients had DSA tested; 12/27 had dnDSA detected. Median time for measured of dnDSA was 7.6 years post-transplant (range 1.07-13.02).Histology: 8/12 biopsies in dnDSA+ve subgroup had antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) of which 6 were active ABMR (3 were C4d positive) compared to 1/16 in dnDSA-ve subgroup. The following treatments were used in the dnDSA+ve group: increase in IS+ pulsed methylprednisolone (MP) (5 patients), increase in existing IS (2), rituximab (2), pulsed MP (1), sirolimus added+pulsed MP (1) . In one patient no change was made. At last follow up, in 9/12 patients with dnDSA an improvement in eGFR was observed. On re-testing for dnDSAs, 3/12 patients tested negative, 2/12 had lower and 3/12 increased levels. 3/12 had not yet had repeat dnDSA testing. Conclusion: Despite previous reports of dnDSA conferring poor prognosis, in our cohort with allograft dysfunction and positive dnDSA an improvement in renal function was observed in 75%. However, larger prospective studies are required to further evaluate these findings.",

Methods: Sixty six stable renal transplant patients (34 females, 32 males), aged 7 to 25 years (mean 17.4\u00b14.3 years) were enrolled in this study. Cardiac function assessed by tissue Doppler echocardiography and blood pressure measurement performed using ambulatory method. Dipping was defined as at least 10% BP decline during the night and was calculated as (mean daytime -mean night time/mean daytime)*% 100. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated by standard 2dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography according to the formula of Devereux and was indexed to height in meters to the 2.7 power to allow the comparison between recipients of different sizes. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined as LVMI>38.6g/m 2.7 in patients younger than 18 years and 51g/m 2.7 in patients > 18 years. Data analysis was performed by SPSS-15.

The CTLs' percentage was significantly lower in Group B when EBV loads first rose above 100 copies/ugDNA. Conclusion: Plasma EBV loads (over 250 copies/ml) estimated by r-PCR and CTLs' monitoring may be useful to distinguish PTLD from other EBV-associated diseases or asymptomatic viremia, and to avoid PTLD as patients with asymptomatic persistent high EBV loads had higher EBV loads and lower percentages of CTLs.",

The graft was transplanted in a left orthotopic position. Venous drainage was to the left ascending lumber vein. In addition, a venous bypass was made using donor ovarian vein between graft vein and splenc vein after splenectomy. Such double venous drainage was working very well after transplantation. There was no surgical complication and the serum creatinine (s-Cr) during the hospital stay was 0.54mg/dl. At second month after the transplantation, she developed an increase of s-Cr with edema and hypertention. However, biopsies of kidney allograft performed at 2 nd and 4 th month after the transplantation revealed no evidence of acute rejection. Hypertention was difficult to control even with a maximum dose of calcium blocker, and a temporary increase of the s-Cr up to 1.30 mg/dl was noted when angiotensin II receptor blocker was administrated. By the ultrasonography, the maximum arterial blood flow of the kidney allograft was high enough (459cm/s) to suggest renal arterial stenosis. Moreover, severe renal arterial stenosis was clearly shown for about 10mm length from the anastomosed site of Aorta by the contrasting CT.For the treatment of artery stenosis of the kidney allograft, percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was performed at 8 th month after the transplantation. The stenotic lesion was expanded using the special dilatation balloon from 1.7mm through 2.0mm in diameter. Because intravascular ultrasonography showed no intimal thickening of the blood vessel, a vascular stent was not placed. After the PTRA, s-Cr was decreased to 0.5mg/dl, and the blood pressure became controllable by antihypertensive agents. Moreover, the angiography performed 4 months after the PTRA revealed no progression of arterial stenosis. The s-Cr of this patient is now stable in 0.7 mg/dl.",

Although risk factors for EPS include prolonged PD, recurrent peritonitis, decreased ultrafiltration and prolonged administration of hypertonic glucose or icodextrin, the pathophysiology of post-transplant EPS is largely unknown. However it has been postulated that the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) after transplantation may promote EPS, as these drugs are considered profibrotic. A recent Scottish study showed that the contribution of post-transplant EPS might be even as much as 50% of the total EPS patients. By contrast pediatric cases are very rare. Therefore we examined the incidence of post-transplant EPS in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively investigated clinical records from 52 consecutive pediatric renal transplant recipients in our center between 2007 to 2012, who performed PD before transplantation. Clinical parameters and PD-related risk factors of EPS were collected at the time of RT. Transplant-related variables were also collected. EPS cases who met ISPD diagnostic criteria including clinical feature and either radiologic and/or histopathological confirmation were examined. Results: The median duration of PD was 2.0 yr (range 0.5 to 7.9). Twelve patients (23.1%) had at least one episode of peritonitis. Ten patients (19.2%) were administered hypertonic glucose and/or icodextrin. The median follow-up period after transplantation was 2.3 yr (range 0.3 to 5.8). All patients were administered CNI, and 2 patients discontinued corticosteroid during the follow-up period. Although 5 patients had ultrafiltration failure at the time of RT, there was no case who developed post-transplant EPS.",

In our experience required Modigraf\u00ae dose was 1.28 times the oral liquid tacrolimus one, and therapeutic levels were attained in one week. Objective: Prescribing of medications in paediatric practice is problematic as many drugs remain unlicensed. This is especially true of immunosuppressive medications. However, there is now a licensed product for Tacrolimus called Modigraf\u00ae with data available on bioavailability. We undertook a single centre prospective study of conversion to Modigraf\u00ae, an oral liquid available in granule formulation (1mg and 0.2mg) that allows for dosing according to body weight. Methods: All paediatric renal transplant recipients (RTR) under the care of a single centre were considered for conversion to Modigraf\u00ae from their current Tacrolimus regimen. Inclusion criteria included all RTR under 18 years of age who were on Tacrolimus suspension. Exclusion criteria included recipients of multi-organ grafts, patients with lactose intolerance and patient choice to continue with their current suspension. Patients were then seen by the multi-disciplinary team. After equivalent dose conversion, patients were monitored with blood tests one week after conversion with subsequent doses adjusted accordingly. Patients continue to be monitored with blood levels over a 3 month period after conversion with renal allograft function, renal allograft loss and side-effect profiles recorded. Results: Forty-three (27% of 158) RTR were considered for conversion to Modigraf\u00ae. The families of four patients requested to stay on their current Tacrolimus suspension, three patients were deemed unsuitable due to lactose intolerance and three patients were excluded due to low doses (incompatibility with the granule dosing). Thirty-three patients were then converted to Modigraf\u00ae and closely monitored. After blood level monitoring one week after conversion, 12% (4) patients had their doses increased due to lower than anticipated 12-hour trough tacrolimus levels. There was stable renal allograft function without renal allograft loss after conversion. Conclusion: Conversion to Modigraf\u00ae immunosuppression can be safely undertaken in paediatric RTR, although regular monitoring in the immediate period of conversion is required to provide accurate immunosuppression dosing.",

Organ donation informed consent form signed by family (children's parents); 3. Approval by the hospital Ethics Committee; 4.Organ donation to the Red Cross Society and allocation by the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS). The Red Cross Society has been commissioned by the Ministry of Health to run this system. Clinical data of 8 children who underwent renal transplantation using organ donations from pediatric patients no more than 6 years between September 2011 and March 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The age at transplantation for these 8 patients was 4.5 years to 14 years and the weight was 14 kg to 35 kg. Among these 8 cases, 7 donors were used aged from 33 days to 6 years and all diagnosed with circulatory death. 5 recipients received en bloc kidney transplantation and the other 3 recipients received one single kidney according to the size of both recipient and donor. The duration of follow-up after the transplantation was 1 month to 18 months. Patient survival rate was 100% and graft survival rate was 7/9 (77.8%, one graft loss due to the hemorrhagic complication and the other one due to the thrombosis). At latest follow-up, the median serum creatinine level was 92umol/L and the median eGFR was 80ml/(min\u00b71.73m 2 ). Conclusion: Organ transplantation legislation is necessary to ensure the rights and obligations of donors, recipients and medical institutions. We believe young pediatric donors can be expanded further to increase the number of pediatric renal transplants. This pediatric to pediatric combination on the one hand efficiently lower the discarding ratio of the kidneys from small donor, and give more chances to the younger recipient on the other.",

Results: (1) the cell numbers of S phase increased obviously and the cell numbers of G2/M phases decreased markedly in the overexpression RGC-32 group(P<0.05). It indicate that RGC-32 could promote cell proliferation by facilitating more cell to become S-phase cells, as well as by adding more cells into the condition of G2/M phases(P<0.01) [Fig 1]. (2) Data show that more ECM and fibrosis factors were produced in the former group than that in the downexpression RGC-32 group. (3) G2/M phases of NRK-52E cells were prevented by lowing the expression of RGC-32. The expressions of EMT-related genes increased markedly and were time dependence(P<0.05), the expression quantity of E-Cadherin decreased gradually (P<0.05). [Fig 2, Fig3]. Conclusion: this study indicated that RGC-32 probably has an important impact on the repair process of renal tubular epithelial cells by regulating G2/M phases check point.

Conclusion: The level of Human carbonic anhydrase IX in the urine can be used as an early diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of renal functions disorders in neonates in critical states after hypoxia. Urinary levels of N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), \u03b11-microglobulin (\u03b11-MG) and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG) are measured as markers of renal tubular damage. We have previously determined normal values for these urine biochemical examinations in healthy children over 3 years old. However, those values were not applicable to children under 3 years old, and children under 1 year old seem to show very high levels for all markers. As normal values for children under 3 years old remain unclear, we determined normal values for urinary biochemistry in this age group. Methods: Fresh urine samples were obtained from 129 healthy children (32 newborns (NB), 41 one-month-old children (1M), 20 sixmonth-old children (6M), 24 one-year-old children (12M), and 12 twoyear-old children (24M)). All of these samples were normal urinalysis. NAG, \u03b11-MG, \u03b22-MG and creatinine (Cr) levels in extracted samples were measured immediately in the central laboratory at Kanazawa Medical Center. Results: Median + 2 standard deviations was used as normal maximum for each measurement item. The normal upper limit of each item was determined in order of NB, 1M, 6M, 12M, 24M, and >=3 years old. Normal upper limits were: NAG, 63.0/ 78.6/ 25.2/ 21.4/ 10.0/ 10.0 IU/g Cr; \u03b11-MG, 101/ 50.6/ 3.52/ 5.04/ 3.54/ 3.80 mg/g Cr;",

The aim of this study is to evaluate renal size with a DMSA scan and propose a simple formula predicting renal size in children. We can predict the renal size in children 1 year of age or older by simple linear formula. We hope that the equation derived from our data performing DMSA scintigraphy can be used to predict renal length in clinical practice. So we can predict renal disease or growing appropriately by DMSA scan.Objective: Zinner`s syndrome was first published in 1914 and describes the combination of renal agenesis and ipsilateral seminal vesicle cysts in adult men. Due to the widespread use of ultrasound in pregnancy and early childhood today, more cases are seen early in life. In our case the cause of bladder calculi was thoughed to be persistant hypospadias despite of treatment and hypercalciuria. Although our country is endemic for nephrolithiasis, bladder calculi is extremely rare during childhood.Objective: Non functioning Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK) is a relatively common renal abnormality in the newborns. The management of this condition has changed over the years (surgical or non-surgical),but still remains controversial. Our aim was to make retrospective assessment of the management of the MCDK and the clinical course of this abnormality. In our center, PGD was the main cause to undergo renal biopsy. IgAN was the most common histologic type while NS was the most common clinical manifestation. For 28 years recently, the constituent ratio of kidney diseases in children with renal biopsy have changed and it varies in different age groups. The clinicopathological features in children with renal biopsy appeared various but correlative. Renal biopsy provided great value in diagnosis, treatment and outcome in children with kidney diseases.Objective: The objective of this study was to retrospectively examine renal biopsy practice and complication rates in our institution. Starship Hospital is a national center, providing Paediatric Renal services to New Zealand. Our usual practice is to aim for same day discharge for both native and transplant biopsies. Biopsies are performed under anaesthesia. The interventional radiologist performs the biopsy using ultrasound guidance. A period of bed rest (4-6 hours) and vital sign monitoring on a day stay unit follows the procedure. There was one incidence of gross haematuria requiring overnight bed rest and had subsequent stable haemoglobin and haematocrit. No other complications arose. Conclusion: Same day discharge for native and transplant renal biopsies was safe and feasible in our paediatric population. These cases were non emergency situations. A careful period of bed rest and observation detected any concerns prior to discharge in the majority.",

Male patients were most likely to suffer from NS, HBV-associated glomerulonephritis (HBVGN) or Alport syndrome, while females were most likely to suffer from isolated hematuria, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), lupus nephritis (LN), ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis or thin basement membrane disease. The proportions of NS, isolated hematuria, acute nephritic syndrome, chronic nephritic syndrome, HBVGN, LN and hemolytic uremic syndrome changed significantly with aging. The clinical patterns of PGN were significantly correlated with the distribution of pathological types: MCD/ML and IgMN presented most often as NS; MCD/ML and IgAN presented most often as isolated hematuria; IgAN and MsPGN presented most often as hematuria with proteinuria. The spectrum of NS, HSPN, HBVGN and IgAN changed during the 23 years, and the percentage of repeated renal biopsies was low (1.2%) in pediatric cases with kidney disease. Conclusion: Glomerular diseases in children are closely related to age and sex of patient. The spectrum of kidney diseases from our center has changed significantly over the last 23 years. ( This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81070557 and 81100514). Normal biopsies or minor abnormalities were more frequently observed in AIMH patients, whereas IgA nephropathy and adverse renal events were more frequent in AMHP. Microscopic hematuria, especially when accompanied by macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria, may represent an important risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease. The cause of AKI was defined as the major underlying disease. The clinical and laboratory features of children with AKI who survived were compared to those who died. Results: Of the 4 015 children admitted into Lagos University Teaching Hospital between July 2010 and July 2012, 70 episodes of AKI were recorded equalling 17.4 cases per 1000 children. The median age of the children with AKI was 4.8 (range 0.1-14.4) years and 68.6% were males. Acute kidney injury is common in children admitted to hospitals. The common causes remain primary kidney diseases, sepsis and malaria but the contribution of sepsis is rising while malaria and gastroenteritis are declining. Acute kidney injury-related mortality remains high.Urine cultures were positive in 10/14 cases; E. coli was the most common cause of AFBN. A combination of nephromegaly and focal mass was found in 11/14 patients. Urinary tract anomalies were found in 8 children. Two boys had underlying disease of acute lymphatic leukemia under chemotherapy. Ten children were treated with cephalosporin, four with Meropenem intravenously. AFBN resolved on average 3-12 weeks after therapy. Renal scar was found in one case. Conclusion: AFBN should be considered in patients with renal mass detected during an episode of urinary infection. Ultrasound and enhanced CT are not necessary in cases of fever of unknown origin, even if pyuria nor urine culture is positive. vesicoureteral reflux(VUR), malignancy and renal vascular malformation are potential risk factors of AFBN, careful radiological investigations should be performed.Objective: There is scant data from many developing countries, including Egypt, as regards HUS in children. The aim of the study was to understand the causes, patient characteristics, management and outcome in our patient population and also to relate these factors to mortality in our cases. Methods: This was a hospital-based chart review of 38 HUS cases admitted at the Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Cairo University, over a 5 year period. Results: HUS patients comprised 28 % of all cases with AKI admitted during that period of time; more than any other single cause of AKI. DHTN should be treated before PNKB. Although diagnosis of perirenal hematoma with routine post-KB US is usually of little significance, its presence could lead to early diagnosis and treatment of major complications. To maximize the safety and costefficiency of KB, our results suggest post-KB US should be done in patients with risk factors for perirenal hematoma, but is not routinely required.Objective: There is an emergence of the burden of chronic diseases like renal disorders worldwide. A periodic review of their prevalence and pattern serves as an invaluable tool in national health budgetary allocations. Previous Nigerian studies reported variations in its prevalence and pattern. We set out to describe these in our locality and to determine if there is a change so as to provide more information for better childhood health care. Methods: A 10 year prospective study of 162 children with various renal disorders seen in the only tertiary facility in Uyo, south south Nigeria, was carried out. Children from birth to 17 years presenting with features suggestive of renal disease were admitted through the children outpatient clinic and the children emergency unit. InformationObjective: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major cause of bacterial disease in the pediatric population. Associated factors such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), posterior urethral valves, neurogenic bladder and other anatomical malformations increase the likelihood of developing renal scarring and dysplasia/hypoplasia, which at the same time increase in thelong term the risk of hypertension (HT), proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To describe the malformations associated with the frequency of UTI and development of CKD in pediatric patients who consulted San Vicente de Paul Hospital, in Medellin, Colombia, between 1960 and 2010. Methods: A descriptive, retrospective study in which the clinical records of 4.476 patients with UTI were evaluated. Results: A total of 4476 patients was evaluated, patients with urinary tract anomalies corresponded to 78.3% of the total (predominance of women: 52.8%). Primary VUR was found in 29.9%; out of these, 5.1% progressed to CKD. Neurogenic bladder was diagnosed in 8.6%, of which 70.8% were secondary to myelomeningocele and 4.9% developed CKD. The posterior urethral valves were present in 3.5% of the total sample, of which 28.5% developed CKD. Conclusion: UTI in the pediatric population is a marker of urinary tract malformation and the prognosis is determined by the presence of VUR, obstructive anomalies and/or renal dysplasia favoring renal scarring, and increasing the risk of hypertension, proteinuria and CKD. An appropriate diagnostic approach would be the basis to implement management strategies to prevent deterioration of renal function.",

Methods: Tfh in CD4+ lymphocytes and mIgA in CD19+ lymphocytes were quantitated by flow cytometry in immunosuppressive agent-treated or untreated IgAN/HSPN Children and healthy controls. Meanwhile, expressions of CH\u03b11, CH\u03b12 ( IgA gene ) were determined by RT-PCR, and Tfh-related cytokines including IL-21 and TGF-\u03b21 were measured in plasma by Elisa. Then Tfh and naive B cells were sorted from IgAN and control and co-cultured, expression of TGF-\u03b21\u3001IL-21\u3001Bcl-6\u3001PRDM-1\u3001AID\u3001CH\u03b11\u3001CH\u03b12 genes were determined by RT-PCR, and secretory expression of IL-21, TGF-\u03b21, IgA were measured in co-cultured supernate by Elisa and mIgA expression were detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. CH\u03b11 and CH\u03b12 expression were most significant at the 6th hour, companied with similar trends in expression of TGF-\u03b21, IL-21, Bcl-6, PRDM-1 and AID genes, all of them declined over time thereafter. At the 9th day, the proteins expressions of mIgA, IL-21, TGF-\u03b21 and IgA were significantly increased in IgAN than in control (P<0.05). Confocal microscope showed IgA expressions were higher in co-cultured cells as well as naive B cells treated with TGF-\u03b21 or IL-21 than untreated naive B cells.Conclusion: This study first demonstrated enhanced IgA class switching by Tfh in IgAN, through upregulating expression of IL-21 and TGF-\u03b21. Moreover,immunosuppressive agent treatment showed their effects on lowering Tfh quantitation in IgAN.

It acts mostly through the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the synthesis and degradation of this hormone are regulated by the enzymes CYP24A1(24-hydroxylase), respectively. We aimed to study the expressions of 1,25(OH)2D3,VDR and in patients with HSP. Methods: The value of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 of 35 HSP patients and 14 normal controls were detected by ELISA. Total RNA of peripheral blood were extracted and transcribed into cDNA. Sybr green dye based real-time quantitative PCR method was used to compare the expression levels (indicated as 2-\u0394Ct value) of VDR and CYP24A1 inpatients with HSP and in the controls. Results: The value of 1,25(OH)2D3 was 13.29\u00b110.12ng/ml in plasma of HSP patients, lower than that of controls (29.51\u00b123.06ng/ml), P<0.05. Compared with controls, the level of VDR mRNA was higher but CYP24A1 mRNA was lower in HSP patients (P < 0.05). Conclusions: There is a deregulation of the Vitamin D signalling and metabolic pathways in HSP. The patients in HSP have lower ability to synthesize active form of Vitamin D and respond to VDR-mediated Vitamin D effects, while increasing the ability to degrade this hormone. Vitamin D may become an effective therapy for these children.Abstract# P-SAT176 Follicular helper T cells in Peyer's Patches induce IgA-secreting B lymphocyte differentiation into plasmablasts and participate in the development of IgA nephropathy Mingshu Zou, Xiaoling Yin, Yu Zhang, Yu Che, Changxia Hu, Fengjie Yang, Jia Wang, Jianhua Zhou Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Hubei, ChinaObjective: Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are believed to play an important role in the generation of IgA-secreting plasmablasts, but the involvement of Tfh cells in the development of IgAN has not been examined so far. Here, we investigated whether Tfh cells mediate B cell differentiation into IgA-secreting plasmablasts in PPs and their role in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Methods: The experimental IgA nephropathy model was established in male BALB/C mice. The percentage of Tfh cells, B220+IgM+, B220+IgA+, B220-IgA+ in PPs were determined by flow cytometry. CXCR5+CD4+ cells were sorted from PPs by magnetic bead and cultured with auto-splenocytes to test the function of Tfh. The mRNA expressions of IL-21, TGF-\u03b21, and protein expression of IL-21, Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 in PP were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Naive B cells (CD27-IgD+) were sorted from children with IgAN by magnetic beads, and cultured with IL-21 to detect J chain production. IgA and galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) excretion. J chain expressions in PBMC and the serum levels of IgA and Gd-IgA1 were also detected respectively. Results: The expression of IgA and Bcl-6 was mainly located in the marginal zones of germinal centers in PPs, but higher expression of both IgA and Bcl-6 was found in IgAN group than in control group.. Compared with controls, the percentage of Tfh , B220+IgM+, B220+ IgA+, B220-IgA+ cells , the level of anti-BSA antibody, the expressions of IL-21, TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and IL-21, Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 proteins in PPs were signi?cantly elevated in IgAN mice respectively. The levels of Gd-IgA1 insupernatant of cultured B cells and in sera of children with IgAN were significantly higher than those in controls respectively(t=3.18, P=0.007, t=2.97, P= 0.014 ), but no significant differences were found in the expression of J chain and IgA levels between two groups. Conclusion: Tfh cells in PPs may play a critical role in in the pathogenesis of IgAN through inducing B cell differentiation into IgAsecreting plasmablasts and generation of potentially nephrotogenic Gd-IgA1.(This study was supported by the NSFC Grant No. 81070557 and 81100514.) Abstract# P-SAT177 Possible relationship between serum homocysteine level and cresent formation in children with IgA nephropathy Objective: The evidences from experimental and epidemiological studies suggested that elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels may lead to renal injury and may be a significant risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease. The aim of the study was to investigate a possible relationship between serum homocysteine (Hcy) level and cresent formation in children with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and Henoch-Schonlein Nephritis (HSPN). Methods: A total of 31 patients diagnosed as biopsy proven IgAN, HSPN and idiopathic cresentic glomerulonephritis (ICGN) in 3 pediatric nephrology centers within last five years were enrolled in the study. Seventeen of them were IgAN, 12 were HSPN and 2 were ICGN. Mean age was 13.19\u00b14.57 (3.53-19.37) years. Twenty of them had cresent formation in kidney biopsy. Serum level of Hcy, vitamin B12 and folic acid were determined by Immulite 2000 chemiluminecance auto-analyser and using commercial kits (Siemens, USA). Referance range of Hcy was 5-12\u03bcg/L. Results: All our patients had normal kidney functions but one with creatinine clearence of 70ml/min/1.73m2. Hcy levels of all patients were higher than the upper limit of normal value. Mean Hcy level of all patients was 23.18\u00b18.66\u03bcg/L(15.10\u00b150.40). Hcy levels were not significantly different in the patients with IgAN and HSPN (22.67 \u00b18.49 vs 21.34\u00b15.44; p=0.79). There was no significant difference between the patients with and without cresent formation regarding Hcy levels (26.71\u00b112.16 vs 21.25\u00b15.43; p=0.17). Presence or severity of proteinuria were not related to Hcy levels (p>0.05). Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were in the normal range in all patients except 2 patients who have low level of vitamin B12. Conclusion: Although presence of increased serum Hcy levels in all our patients was an interesting observation, our results did not show any relationship between Hcy level and cresent formation in children with IgAN and HSPN.

Methods: In this cross sectional study we recruited 20 children aged 1-16 years with SRNS in complete (n=14) or partial remission (n=6) and similar number of controls. Complete remission was defined as (Up/Uc < 0.2 gm/gm; serum albumin > 2.5 g/dl and no edema) and partial remission as (Up/Uc between 0.2 gm/gm and 2gm/gm, serum albumin >2.5 g/dl, and no edema). Serum levels of FT3, FT4 and TSH were measured in all the subjects. Overt hypothyroidism was defined as low FT4 (normal values: 0.7-2.0 ng/ml) and elevated serum TSH above reference values (0.45-4.5 mIU/L). Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) was defined as an elevation in serum TSH with a normal serum FT4 concentration. Grade I SH hypothyroidism was defined as TSH greater than 4.5 mIU/L and less than 6 mIU/L, grade II SH as TSH between 6 and 12 mIU/L, and grade III SH as TSH > 12 mIU/L. Primary outcome measure was serum levels of FT3, FT4 and TSH in children with SRNS. Results: Thirty per cent children (n=6) with SRNS had non-autoimmune subclinical hypothyroidism (2 each of grade I, II and grade III). levels were high as compared to controls. Out of 6 children with SH, 3 were in partial remission, 3 were in complete remission. TSH levels normalized on thyroxine supplementation in grade II and III subclinical hypothyroidism. Conclusion: Subclinical non-autoimmune hypothyroidism is present in significant proportion of children with SRNS despite complete or partial remission. Thyroid profile should be evaluated routinely in this subset of patients.Abstract# P-SAT179Vitamin D in Nephrotic Syndrome Remission : a case-control study Sushmita Banerjee 1 , Surupa Basu 2 , Jayati Sengupta 1 1 Nephrology, Institute of Child Health, Kolkata, India 2 Biochemistry, Institute of Child Health, Kolkata, IndiaObjective: Vitamin D is required to maintain bone health; in addition low Vitamin D status may be a risk factor for multiple non-osseous disease states. 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) is lost in urine during Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) Relapse, and this may contribute to osteoporosis in NS. However, the majority of pediatric NS patients are in relapse for only short durations.To assess: (1) whether NS patients in Remission have vitamin D deficiency compared to controls (2) whether vitamin D status differs according to NS disease characteristics and therapy (3) the relationship between vitamin D and serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in both groups. Methods: A cross-sectional case control study was performed in 40 NS patients in remission and 40 healthy controls. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, ALP and intact PTH were assayed. NS patients were segregated by age at onset, current age, type and duration of NS, months since relapse, and drug therapy. Results: 25(OH)D levels showed significant positive correlation with months elapsed since last NS relapse (rs=+0.4, p=0.012), being lower within 3 months of relapse but similar to that of controls in patients in remission for more than 3 months (median 14.23 vs. 19.75 ng/ml, p=0.039). There was no correlation of 25(OH)D levels with any other disease characteristic or drug therapy. ALP levels were also lowest after relapse (rs=+0.34, p=0.036).Overall, 25(OH)D below 20 ng/ml occurred in 62.5%, correlated negatively with age (rs= \u22120.23, p=0.04) but showed no correlation with calcium, phosphate or PTH levels. Conclusion: Vitamin D stores as measured by serum 25(OH)D remain low for about 3 months after NS relapse and subsequently rise to control levels. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm this and supplementation with adequate doses of Vitamin D should be considered during and post NS relapse.Vitamin D insufficiency is common overall, and large population based interventional studies are required to determine optimum levels for children.Levels of ALP in NS and of calcium, phosphate and PTH overall, are poor markers of vitamin D insufficiency as defined today.Abstract# P-SAT180 Expression and co-localization of nephrin and podocin in adriamycin-induced nephrotic rats You Sheng Yu, Yuan Yuan Ma, Li Yu Department of pediatrics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangdong, ChinaObjective: To observe the expression and distribution of nephrin and podocin in adriamycin-inducing nephrotic (ADN) rats and explore the possible mechanisms of nephrin and podocin during the progression of nephronephrotic syndrome.

Inserm U983 and Dept. of Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Paris, France 3 Pediatrics II, Hopital Necker, Essen, GermanyObjective: The R138Q mutation in the NPHS2 gene (encoding podocin) causes early-onset nephrotic syndrome progressing to renal failure. The inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model develops a nephropathy strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. We recently demonstrated podocyte-protective and antiproteinuric effects of the calcimimetic agent R-568 using in vitro and toxin-induced in vivo models of nephrotic syndrome. The aim of this study was to apply the inducible podocin-knock-in mouse model to test the efficacy of R-568 in hereditary podocyte disease. Methods: C57BL/6 mice with Nphs2 Flox/R140Q , Cre + genotype were injected with Tamoxifen or vehicle for 5 days to induce hemizygosity for R140Q-mutant podocin. On the fifth day osmotic mini pumps were implanted subcutaneously, with either different concentration of R-568 (1 or 5mg/kg/d) or vehicle only. Weight, blood pressure and proteinuria were monitored weekly. Biochemical and histopathological changes were examined by sacrificing animals after 4 weeks.Results: Proteinuria was markedly attenuated in animals treated with R-568 (proteinuria 14.5% of untreated animals at week 2). Blood pressure did not differ between the groups. After 4 weeks, treated animals had higher creatinine clearance (187% of untreated animals), lower serum creatinine (0.11 vs. 0.15 mg/dl), urea (59 vs. 112 mg/dl) and cholesterol levels (236 vs. 357 mg/dl). Western blot analysis showed almost completely abolished podocin abundance in untreated animals, whereas podocin expression was partially retained in the R-568-treated animals. The average number of podocytes per glomerulus was higher in treated animals (55% of healthy controls, vs. 46% in untreated animals). Moreover, R-568-treated animals scored lower total fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis indices.Conclusions: Administration of the calcimimetic R-568 attenuates proteinuria, interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis in mice carrying the most common human podocin mutation. Our findings raise the hope that calcimimetics might become a novel pharmacological nephroprotective approach in children with hereditary podocytopathies.Abstract# P-SAT184 Viral Persistence in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Nephropathy in Rats--A Probably Main Mechanism of Immune Disorder in Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome Yan-Nan Guo, Zheng Wang, Jin Wu Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China",

In addition, the immunoregulatory molecule FOXP3 was also analyzed in INS and compared to controls. Methods: This study included 43 patients with INS and 15 age and sex-matched healthy subjects (control group). INS patients were subdivided according to the response to steroids in steroid sensible (SS, n=31) and steroid resistant (SR, n=12). Patients and controls were submitted to peripheral blood collection. The molecules of interest in blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Comparisons were made between SS and SR patients, each subgroup and controls and the whole group of INS versus controls. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: SR patients exhibited a significant reduction in the percentage of B lymphocytes (CD3-CD19+) and in NK cells (CD3-CD56+) in comparison to controls. On the other hand, SS patients presented a reduction inthe percentage of NKT cells. Concerning leukocyte migration, the expression of CD18 in T lymphocytes (CD3+) and in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) was significantly lower in SS patients in comparison to SR cases and to controls. Both subgroups of INS (SR and SS) had higher percentage of CCR2+ lymphocytes than controls. However, CCR5 lymphocytes increased only in SR patients, while CXCR4 lymphocytes were higher exclusively in SS subgroup. Only SS patients significantly increased the expression of the regulatory molecule FOXP3 in T lymphocytes (CD4+). Conclusion: INS patients presented significant changes in leukocytes populations and in immunorregulation in comparison to healthy subjects. Furthermore, the immune profile was different according to the sensibility to steroid therapy.Abstract# P-SAT186Puromycin aminonucleoside increases podocyte permeability by modulating ZO-1 in an oxidative stress-dependent manner Tae-Sun Ha, Hye-Young Park, Ja-Ae Nam, Soo-Bin Sung Pediatrics, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, KoreaObjective: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis is a widely studied model of human idiopathic nephrotic syndrome because PAN injection into rats results in increased glomerular permeability with the characteristic ultrastructural changes in glomerular epithelial cells (GEpCs; podocytes) similar to human nephrosis. Methods: To investigate the role of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and oxidative stress on PAN-induced podocyte phenotypical changes and hyperpermeability in vitro, we cultured rat and mouse podocytes and treated with various concentrations of PAN. Results: PAN treatment increased oxidative stress level of GEpCs significantly with the induction of Nox4, a NADPH oxidase subunit. In addition, PAN changes the ultrastructure of GEpCs, such as shortening and fusion of microvilli, and the separation of intercellular gaps. PAN also disrupted the intercellular linear ZO-1 staining and induced inner cytoplasmic re-localization of ZO-1 protein, resulting inincreased intercellular permeability. PAN reduced ZO-1 protein amount and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, which means that PAN could also modulate ZO-1 protein transcriptionally. PAN also induced the overexpression of Nox4 significantly compared with scrambled siRNA transfection and negative control (n=3, P<0.01), which was suppressed by transfected Nox4 siRNA These phenotypical changes of podocyte caused by PAN were reversed by the antioxidative effect of vitamin C. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the quantitative and distributional disturbances of intercellular ZO-1 via oxidative stress likely contribute to the glomerular hyperpermeability caused by PAN.Abstract# P-SAT187The role of HS N-sulfation in the pathogenesis of RSV nephropathyLiqun Dong Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Chengdu, ChinaObjective: To explore the role of N-sulfation of heparan sulfate (HS) on RSV nephropathy. Methods: Immunofluorescence was performed on the kidneys, lungs and livers of a rat model of RSV nephropathy with antibody of 3G10, 10E4 and HepSS1, which all recognize distinct HS species. 3G10 can react with heparitinase-created HS-stubs, Hepss1 can recognize the \"mixed\" HS domains containing both N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units, and 10E4 can joint N-sulfated HS domains. The susceptibility of the tissues to RSV was detected by western blot with RSVF. The Hep-2, HEK293 and Lo2 cells pretreated with heparinases were studied for RSV adhension by flow cytometry, so as to further explore the HS domains on the different cells which can mediate RSV adhension. The HS domains on the kidney of MCNS were analyzed to explore how the virus makes MCNS develop. Results: The results of immunofluorescence showed the expression of 10E4 (kidney 53.93+/\u221210.6, lung 60.34+/\u22126.1) was higher than3G10 (kidney 34.98+/\u221211.2, lung 39.46+/\u221212.08), and Hepss1 (kidney 50.46+/\u221214.38, lung 56.68+/\u22123.89) significant higher in the normal. At 8 and 14 days after RSV inoculated, RSVF of the kidneys and lungs showed stronger than the livers. In all groups, the HS domains and RSVF in kidneys showed a correlation. In vitro, Hep-2 was markedly susceptible to RSV, HEK293 secondly. Treatments with heparinases reduced RSV adhesion of HEK293 cells and Hep-2. 10E4 (46.15+ /\u221214.52) and Hepss1 (40.14+/\u221210.43) on the glomeruli of the children with MCNS were decreased significantly, compararing to the controls (10E440.14+/\u221210.43, Hepss1 47.58+/\u221210.03). RSV was detected in the kidney of 2 MCNS, and 10E4 (36.50+/\u22126.18) and Hepss1 (37.11+ /\u22127.14) in 2 RSV positive children were significantly lower than the controls. Conclusion: In the study, there were two main findings:(1)  it was because of the Heterogeneity of HS, that is, rich N-sulfation in the kidney mediating RSV adhesion, which resulted in the development of MCNS; (2) At 4 to 120 days after inoculation with RSV, N-sulfated group continued to decrease, indicating RSV persistent and sustained damage to the kidney during the progress of rat nephropathy.Objective: Glomerulosclerosis correlates with reduction in podocyte number that occurs through mechanisms which including apoptosis.Podocyte injury or loss in the renal glomerulus has been proposed as the crucial mechanism in the development of glomerulosclerosis. Survivin is a member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, that uniquely also promotes mitosis and cell survival. Postnatally, survivin is hardly detected in most tissues, but is upregulated in our previous studies using pruomycin aminonucleoside(PAN) nephrosis model. however, little is known about the significance of suivivin in podocytes. Methods: Mouse podocyte cell line was cultured and incubated with PAN. Immunoblot was used to examine the level of surviving expression. Survivin siRNA and overexpression plasmids were transfected into the cultured podocytes to silence or overexpressing survivin expression. F-actin arrangement within podocytes was investigated by immuonofluorescence, while the apoptosis rate was examined by both Hoechst stain, MTT and terminal dUTP nick endlabeling assay. Results: PAN upregulated survivin expression in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner of treatment. Notably, podocyte apoptosis occurred. However, Knockdown of survivin expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) exacerbated podocyte apoptosis and a remarkable derangement of actin cytoskeleton compared to only injured by PAN. Overexpression of survivin by survivin overexpressing plasmids ameliorates podocyte apoptosis and podocyte cytoskeleton rerangement induced by PAN. Conclusion: Upregulation of survivin expression during PAN nephrosis could protect podocytes from apoptosis and may maintain the podocyte cytoskeleton during podocyte injuries.",

Severe effects of PAN were observed on cytoskeletal elements including tubulin, myosin and actin (fold change \u221219 / -5.8 / -2.7; PAN vs. control) which were recovered by EV to a large extent (fold change 4.2 / 2.3 / 1.6; PAN-EV vs. PAN). Conclusion: Together, our data establish a novel role of the mTOR inhibitor EV in podocyte cytoskeletal remodeling, involving activation of RhoA and MLC. Analysis of differential gene expression data points to an outstanding role of additional cytoskeletal-associated genes, regulated by EV. 1Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan 2 Division of Nephrology, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan 3 Division of Cell Biology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan 4 Biomedical Reseach Center, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan",

Methods: HMCs were cultured and divided into control group, high lipid group, high lipid plus inflammatory stress group or 4phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) group. After 24h, 48h, and 72h, Oil red O staining was used to evaluate lipid droplet accumulation in the cells. Cell number of proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. Expression of GRP78 protein was measured by immunocytochemistry. The mRNA levels of GRP78, FN were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Compared with control group, the intracellular cholesterol level was increased in high lipid group and high lipid plus inflammatory stress group (R<0.01), cell number of proliferation was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (R<0.01). Furthermore, the mRNA level of FN was higher in two groups (R<0.01). Compared with high lipid plus inflammatory stress group, 4-PBA could inhibit HMCs proliferation (R<0.01) and expression of FN mRNA (R<0.05) induced by high lipid. Compared with control group, the expression of GRP78 mRNA and protein were obviously elevated in high lipid group and high lipid plus inflammatory stress group (R<0.05), which could be inhibited by 4-PBA treatment(R<0.01). Conclusion: High lipid significantly promotes the glomerular mesangial cell injury under inflammation stress conditions, the mechanism may account for endoplasmic reticulum stress. Reducing ER stress may present a way to attenuate cell injury.Objective: To compare zinc levels in patient of nephrotic syndrome with or without infection associated relapse. Methods: Case-control study. Tertiary level teaching hospital. Consecutive previously diagnosed cases of nephrotic syndrome with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of infection attending the pediatric nephrology clinic of department of pediatrics were enrolled. Serum zinc, serum albumin, urine zinc, urinary creatinine and hair zinc levels were measured at enrollment and repeated once the patient was in remission and 'infection-free'. Results: Forty five cases of nephrotic syndrome (29 boys) were recruited into the study. Twenty eight of these had nephrotic range proteinuria at enrolment of which eighteen cases continued to have proteinuria despite treatment of infection and required treatment for relapse. Serum zinc level were lower in those who relapse (83.6, 95%CI 75.9-91.2\u03bcg/dl), P<0.05. Hair zinc level were lower in those who relapse (144.5, 95%CI 139.9-149.0\u03bcg/gm), P<0.001. Urinary excretion of zinc was not significantly different. Serum zinc/ serum albumin were higher in those who relapse (39.98, 95%CI 33.8-46.1), P<0.001. Hair zinc levels less than 157 \u03bcg/dl has 81% sensitivity and 89% specificity for predicting relapses with infection. Serum zinc levels increases once infection subsides by 11.8 \u03bcg/dl (95%CI 16.9-6.6), P< 0.001. Conclusion: Hair zinc levels are lower in patient of nephrotic syndrome who relapse after infection.Abstract# P-SAT199Role of regulatory T cells in childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndromeShoji Tsuji, Takahisa Kimata, Sosaku Yamanouchi, Tetsuya Kitao, Guodong Lu, Tomohiko Shimo, Kazunari Kaneko Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, JapanObjectives: Pathogenesis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) remains unknown. Recently, it has been postulated that structural change of the glomerular podocytes induced by overexpression of CD80 on their foot process leads to massive proteinuria. Though it had been considered that CD 80 was only expressed on antigen presenting cells, recent observations revealed that it is also present on podocytes and is controlled by regulatory T cells (Treg). Based on these findings, we conducted this study to clarify an involvement of Treg in INS. Methods: Ten patients with INS were enrolled. Their blood was sampled 2 times, once before treatment and another at remission induced by steroid administration (median age: 3.2-years-old, 8 male and 2 female). The number of Treg occupying lymphocyte was measured using a cytofluorometer (Epics XL II; Coulter, Hialeah, FL) with the System II Software program. Data from 10,000 events per sample were acquired. Briefly, anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody were added to the tube, and the tube was then incubated. After membrane staining and washing, the cells were incubated with anti-FoxP3 monoclonal antibody for 30 min. The number of Treg, assessed as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells, was calculated based on the corresponding lymphocytes count. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistics and a P value of less than 0.05 was determined as having a significant difference. Results: The percentage of Treg in leukocytes in the peripheral blood significantly increased at remission compared to onset or relapse (at onset or relapse: 3.1% in number; at remission: 4.0% in number, P=0.013, n=10). Conclusion: Treg might be involved in the pathogenesis of INS. It is also suggested that steroid induce remission by suppression on podocytes CD80 controlled by Treg.Sohsaku Yamanouchi, Tomohiko Shimo, Yasushi Adachi, Jiro Kino, Tetsuya Kitao, Takahisa Kimata, Shoji Tsuji, Kazunari Kaneko Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan",

After passage the cells were shifted to non-permissive condition at37\u00b0C and cultrued for 10-14 days.Then they were transfected with Orai1 small interfering RNA(siRNA) using transfection reagent lipofectamine 2000.Transfection efficiency was measured by flow cytometer and inhibitory effect of Orai1 siRNA was determined by RT-PCR and western blot at 48 and 72 hours respectively after transfection. Results: Under the conditions of the experiment , (1) the transfection efficiency of FAM-siRNA was 76% (P<0.05).(2) After transfection with specific siRNA,the expression levels of Orai1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated about 59% and 37% respectively (P<0.05). In the case of Orai1 gene expression weaken , the expression levels of \u03b1actinin-4 and podocin mRNA were down-regulated about 44% and 40% respectively (P<0.05),of protein were down-regulated about 29%and 31% (P<0.05) ,whereas nephrin and TRPC6 mRNA showed no-change. Conclusion: Knocking-down ORAI1 gene expression can interfere some podocyte-associated proteins.Objective: To investigate the effects of leukotriene receptor antagonist (Montelukast) on serum indicators, urine indicators, renal pathology, intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1), nephrin and podocalyxin in adriamycin(ADR)-induced nephropathy (AND) rats. Methods: ADR nephropathy was induced by a tail intravenous injection of ADR.The rats were randomly divided into five groups: A group (control group), B group (ADN group) , C group (prednisonetreated group), D group (montelukast-treated group) and E group (prednisone and montelukast -treated group) .Serum index and 24h urine protein were measured serially at 4th,8th weeks..The values of creatinine clearance(Ccr) were calculated.Kidney tissues were cllected for microscopy observation.The expression of nephrin,podolyxin and ICAM-1 in renal tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry SP. Results: Compared with A group,at the 4th week, 24 hours urine protein and albumin reached the level of ADR nephropathy model.Compared with B group,at the 8th week,24h urine protein,cholestrol,serum creatinine,renal pathology changes in the three treated group rats were significantly reduced (P<0.05),serum total protein,albumin and Ccr significantly raised(P<0.05), ECM/GA and renal pathology score significantly reduced (P<0.01), ICAM-1 significantly decreased (P<0.01),nephrin and podolyxin significantly increased.Besides,the curative effect of integrated treatment was better than other treatment group. Conclusion: The integrated treatment of leukotriene receptor antagonist and prednisone has asynergistic effect, and the efficacy is superior to each drug alone.",

NPHS2 mutations are reported to have an important role in NS manifesting in the first year of life in Europe and the United States. However, in Japan NPHS2 mutation was detected only one in the present study. NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 mutations are also responsible in a considerable part of CNS and INS in Japan.Conclusion: Mutations in the NPHS2 gene are responsible for congenital, infantile, childhood and adult onset SRNS. Most of the 122 mutations reported to date are missense mutations, but inter-ethnic variability is reported in the frequency and the type of mutations. Genotype-phenotype analyses established correlations between some variants and age at onset, ethnicity and clinical evolution. Based on this review, we created a web database using the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) software, that lists all identified variants and will allow the inclusion of future reports. in children presenting with NS in the first year of life predicts remission or progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Methods: We reviewed the histological diagnosis and clinical course of all children diagnosed with NS before one year of age at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) Renal Unit between 1990 and 2009.

Methods: rHuEPO was given to 22 haemodialysis (HD) patients and 13 patients on conservative treatment,with mean age (10.84+/-4.08) years,25 males and 10 females with mean HCT(26.75+/-4.70) Blood pressure, haematocrit, iron-indices, serum potassium, calcium,phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase,urea nitrogen and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were monitored serially. Results: Serum aluminum was measured randomly in 6 patients , results were normal ranging from 12-22 ug/l.When serum ferritin was <100ng/ml during therapy,they received iron supplementation.According to the response, patients were divided into 2 groups ,the non-responders group with HCT<27,mean age (9.97+/-3.55) years, 13 males and 6 females with mean iPTH (669.9+/-461.77) pg/ml and group of responders with HCT > 27 with mean age (11.66+/-4.32 ) years,12 males and 4 females with mean iPTH (261.19+/-33.17) pg/ml,15 HD patients never reached target HCT at this dose versus 2 patients on conservative treatment; By comparison between both groups as regards laboratory values, it shows reticulocytic count ,iPTH and serum ferritin were significantly higher in the non-responders( NR) versus the responders(R) with p values (p= 0.04,p=0.006,p=0.04) respectively ,while serum calcium,albumin were significantly lower between NR versus R with p values ( p=0.007, p= 0.003 ) respectively. Inspite that iron, TIBC,%transferin saturation and KT/V shows non significant difference between NR and R group, also caloric intake as % of recommended daily allowance shows non significant difference between both groups.However intact parathormone levels were significantly higher before and after 16 weeks of erythropoetin (EPO) therapy in the NR versus R groups , P< 0.05 versus p= 0/006 respectively. Conclusion: So we conclude that in the absence of other well-known response-imiting factors, the erythropoetic response to erythropoetin therapy depends largely on the extent of secondary hyperparathyroidism.Abstract# P-SAT374 Anemia In Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease Patients and Renal Allograft RecipientsAsli Kavaz, Z.Birsin Ozcakar, Burcu Bulum, Mesiha Ekim, Fatos Yalcinkaya Pediatric Nephrology, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey",

To correlate the dietary intake to biochemical parameters, anthropometry and stages of CKD. Methods: Prospective observational study. Children with CKD visiting the outpatient services were enrolled in the study; age of onset, cause of CKD and anthropometry recorded. Dietary intakes from three 24 hours dietary recalls (2 midweek and 1 weekend day) were recorded. Individual macronutrients & micronutrients in the diet were calculated using dietsoft software (based on Indian diets). A blood sample was taken from all subjects for biochemical parameters (KFT, venous blood gas, serum albumin levels, serum calcium, phosphate, SAP and potassium). Results: A total of 45 children (40M; 5 F) with CKD underwent nutritional assessment. The median age at assessment was 108 (13-167) months. Twenty seven (60%) subjects had CKD stage 1, 2 or 3 while remaining 40% had CKD stage 4 or 5. The baseline biochemical and anthropometric parameters are given inTable 1. Of the 45 children 27 (60%) had moderate to severe malnutrition at assessment. The height & weight SDS were significantly lower in subjects with CKD stage 4&5 (pvalue 0.03 & 0.48 respectively) as compared to CKD 1-3. The mean caloric deficit from RDA was -40.33% for calories, +6.15% for proteins, -10.51% for fats. The diet was highly deficient in iron (mean 48.9% deficit); excess in phosphates (mean 18.3%). The mean energy deficit was -26.61% in CKD stages 1-3 while it was -60.9% in stages 4&5.Conclusion: Children with CKD are highly predisposed to malnutrition and iron deficiency especially in higher stages of CKD. An appropriate dietary assessment and nutritional counseling should be planned for all patients with CKD to prevent complications associated with malnutrition and anemia.Abstract# P-SAT384 Dialysis Duration is the Most Important Predictor of Growth Failure in Children on Peritoneal DialysisOmega Mellyana 1 , KarHui Ng 1, 2 , Mya Than 2 , Lourdes Paula Resontoc 1 , Noor Haziah Hussain 1 , Geng Jing 1 , Perry Yew-Weng Lau 1 , Isaac Desheng Liu 1 , Wee Song Yeo 1 , Hui Kim Yap 1, 2 1 Paediatric Nephrology, Shaw-NKF-NUH Children's Kidney Centre, Singapore 2 Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, SingaporeObjective: Growth retardation is a common problem in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Contributing factors include poor nutrition, mineral bone disease, anemia, chronic acidosis and growth hormone resistance. This study aimed at determining factors affecting growth in Asian children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).Methods: 53 consecutive children on PD (mean age at ESRD 13.0 \u00b1 5.1 years and mean dialysis duration 4.6 \u00b1 2.7 years) were studied. Patients with underlying genetic causes of growth failure and spina bifida were excluded. Parameters studied serum calcium, phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), hemoglobin and weekly Kt/V urea . The end-point of this study was defined as time of renal transplant or end of study period if patient were still on dialysis. Parameters were recorded 3-monthly starting from chronic kidney disease stage 2 till end-point. Linear regression analysis was performed using age at ESRD, gender, duration of dialysis, time-averaged data and use of growth hormone, to identify predictors of height standard score (SDS) at the end point. Results: Of the 53 dialysis children, 24 (45%) were growth retarded at the end-point with height SDS \u2264-2.0. The mean height SDS was -1.73 \u00b1 2.09. Five (9.4%) patients received growth hormone therapy. The mean timeaveraged hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate and iPTH levels were 10.9 \u00b1 1.3g/dL, 2.45 \u00b1 0.13 mmol/L, 1.91 \u00b1 0.36 mmol/L and 57.1 \u00b1 79.8 pmol/L respectively. Linear regression analysis showed that only duration of dialysis was a significant predictor of height SDS. With every increase of one year of dialysis, the height SDS decreased by 0.235 (95% CI 0.028-0.440, p=0.027). Conclusion: Duration of dialysis was the most important predictor of growth retardation in children on PD. Early renal transplantation should therefore be advocated in order to maximize growth potential in children with ESRD.Abstract# P-SAT385 Invasive Aspergillosis in a Patient with Chronic Renal Failure Neslihan CicekDeniz, Nurdan Yildiz, Ibrahim Gokce, Harika Alpay Marmara University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey",

Methods: 59 Staff Nurses were appraised evaluating SC while 525 hemodialysis patients were evaluated using the QPDO parameters. Univariate linear regression and Pearson rho moment correlation were used to build relationships. Results: Data indicated both increase and decrease trends in relation to staff competency. Competencies related to Health Education ( \u2191172.6), Communication (\u2191147.5), Records Management (\u2191141.6), Safe and Quality Nursing Care (\u2191135.0), and Management of Resources (\u2191133.5) demonstrated increase trends. Competencies related to Research (\u2191-35.2), Quality Improvement (\u2191-12.3), and Legal Responsibility (\u2191-6.68) were relatively decreased as the period of competency evaluation progressed. It was notable that QPDO related to Kt/V, Albumin, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit Levels were directly proportional to increasing extent of SC p=(+0.61) while calcium and phosphorus levels were directly associated to areas where staff were demonstrated an decreasing trend p=(+0.66).",

Methods: The study included 94 children (58 male, 36 female) with urinary incontinence and healthy 30 children as the control group aged 5-17 years. PinQ questionnaire and the proxy questionnaire were adapted into Turkish. PinQ and KINDL were applied to the children with urinary incontinence at 0. month, 3. month and 6. month while PinQ Proxy and WHOQOL questionnaires were applied to the parents. Validity and reliability of the PinQ questionnaire was evaluated. Moreover, IBSS (dysfunctional voiding and incontinence scoring system) was applied to the patients to evaluate for the influence of disease severity on quality of life and the sensitivity of PinQ to disease severity. Results: Mean total scores of the Turkish version of PinQ for 0., 3. and 6. month follow ups were calculated as: 34 , 18,7 and 15,3 in boys and 31, 21,1 and 18,6 in girls respectively. There was a correlation between child and proxy questionnaire scores. Questionnaire scores were highly sensitive to the changes in IBSS scores (criterion validity). PinQ Turkish version was not significantly related with age, gender and incontinence type. With the KINDL questionnaire, it was demonstrated that quality of life is significantly impaired in children with incontinence compared to the control cases especially in the self esteem domain. Evaluation the impact on quality of life revealed that PinQ and KINDL were correlated. No significant difference was detected between parents of disease and control groups.Conclusion: The Turkish version of the Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure to assess health related quality of life child with urinary incontinence. Quality of life of children with urinary incontinence decreases under the influence of disease severity.

Methods: In part 1, forward and backward translations following a stringent validation protocol produced the Chinese translation version. Content validity of the translated instrument was assessed. In part 2, internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by 38 pairs of parents and children with end-stage renal disease aged 5 to 18. The data was further analysed according to different treatment modalities. Results: The translated Hong Kong Chinese version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory \u2122 (PedsQL\u2122) End-stage Renal Disease Module (PedsQL\u2122 3.0 ESRD Module-HKC) was found to have good content validity and was acceptable to most patients and parents. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.91 in Patient version and =0.94 in Parent version). Test-retest reliability, determined with the intraclass correlation coefficients, was excellent (0.89 in Patient version and0.93 in Parent version). It was found that there was significant better HRQOL in patient received renal transplantation compared with Dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis, p=0.006.)Conclusion: This study suggested good content validity, internal consistency, and reliability of the Chinese version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory \u2122 (PedsQL\u2122) End-stage Renal Disease Module (PedsQL\u2122 3.0 ESRD Module-HKC). It opened a new dimension of health care assessment for end-stage renal disease children in Hong Kong. Transplantation was reported to have a significant better quality of life score. Further studies with larger samples should be performed to confirm the psychometric properties of this translated instrument. Transplantation: Access and Outcomes Abstract# P-SAT399 The Outcome of Induction Therapy on Graft Survival in Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients: A Single Center Experience Christine Salvador Caringal Pediatric Nephrology, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, Quezon City, PhilippinesObjective: To know the outcome of induction therapy on graft survival in pediatric renal transplant patients. Methods: All pediatric patients who underwent renal transplantation at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute from 2005-2009 was included in the study. This is a retrospective case-control study. Data were collected from the Philippine Renal Disease Registry and patient charts. Fischer's test and odds ratio were used at 95% confidence interval. Results: Mean age of patients is 12.38+/-3.669. Male to female ratio is 2:1. Forty one patients are Filipino while 9 patients are from other countries. The primary renal diseases are as follows: Glomerulonephritis, clinical (56%), Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (8%), IgA Nephropathy (6%), and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (6%). Forty-one patients are on dialysis while 9 patients are not. Among those on dialysis, 53.6% of them is on peritoneal dialysis while 46.3% is on hemodialysis. Induction therapy was given in 86% of patients. Induction therapy used were as follows: Daclizumab (21 patients or 42%), Alemtuzumab (15 patients or 30%), and Basiliximab (6 patients or 12%). Fourteen patients or 28% underwent graft rejection within 1 year post-transplantation. Rejection rate for patients who received induction therapy was 30% while rejecton rate for those without induction was 14%. Induction therapy was not statistically significant in determining graft survival.Conclusion: Induction therapy does not predict graft survival among pediatric kidney transplant patients within 1 year posttransplantation. Induction therapy and Graft Rejection within 1st year post-transplant Kiran Prakash Sathe, S S Joshi, Kumud Pravin Mehta 1 Pediatrics, Jaslok Hospital & Research centre, Mumbai, India 2 Urology, Jaslok Hospital & Research centre, Mumbai, India Objective: To evaluate the patient characteristics, complications and outcome of renal transplantation in pediatric end stage renal disease (ESRD). Retrospective observational analysis Methods: Children with ESRD subjected to renal transplantation in last five years (April 2007-March 2012) at Jaslok Hospital. Demographic data of the renal transplant recipients and donors, prior dialysis, surgical details of renal transplantation, immunosuppression , medical and surgical complications and post transplant follow up and outcome was assessed.Results: 20 children in the age group 6 years to 18 years (mean 14.6 years) underwent renal transplantation in last 5 years at our hospital. Fifteen percent cases (n=3) weighed < 20 kg at transplantation. Primary cause of renal failure was glomerular in 30%, tubulointerstitial in 45% and unknown in 25%. All were primary transplants, preemptive in 15%; live related in 95%, cadeveric in 5%. Mothers were the kidney donors in 60% cases. Induction therapy was used in 60% cases, while maintainence therapy comprised of triple regimen (prednisolone, mycofenolate moefetil and tacrolimus). Infection was the commonest complication (40%) , UTI being the most common. Perinephric collection (20%), renovascular thrombosis (10%, associated with graft dysfunction) and lymphocoele( 15%) comprised the other complications. 15% experienced graft rejection (acute cellular rejection (ACR), 66.6% and antibody mediated rejection (AMR),33.3%) with complete renal recovery following treatment.73.4% and 72.8% had functioning grafts at the end of one and three years respectively. Conclusion: Pediatric renal transplantation was associated with 100% patient survival and is a safe therapeutic option for children with ESRD.Abstract# P-SAT401 Long-term outcome of kidney transplantation in patients with lower urinary tract abnormalities Institute of nephrology, Schneider children's medical center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel 2 Sackler Faculty of medicine, Tel Aviv university, Tel Aviv, Israel 3 Division of urology, Schneider children's medical center of Israel, Petah Tikva, IsraelObjective: About 15% of pediatric kidney transplant recipients have a history of lower urinary tract abnormalities (LUTA), placing them at high postoperative risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The risk is further increased in patients who undergo bladder augmentation as part of the transplant procedure. Data on long-term graft outcome in this patient population are sparse. The aim of this study was to evaluate graft function in children with LUTA and the effect of UTIs. Methods: Single center retrospective study. Results: Of the 33 patients, who met the study criteria, 11 had bladder augmentation and 22 did not. Bladder augmentation was performed simultaneously with (n=7) or after (n=4) kidney transplantation and was not associated with surgical complications. Intermittent catheterization was performed in 91% of the bladderaugmentation group and 13% of the transplant-only group. Graft function was better in the bladder-augmentation group at 2 months (eGFR 92\u00b113 ml/min vs 79.4\u00b116.6 ml/min in the transplant-only group, p=0.02) and 2 years (eGFR 85.2\u00b117.6 ml/min vs 77\u00b116.5 ml/min, p=0.23). However, by 3 years, it had deteriorated significantly (51\u00b129.2 vs 67\u00b120.8 ml/min in the transplant-only group, p=0.16) and at 5 years, rates of graft survival were 64% in the bladder-augmentation group compared to 100% in the transplant-only group. The reason for graft failure was noncompliance with drug therapy in 3 patients; fourth patient had multiple UTIs with no other apparent etiology. Rates of UTI were significantly higher in the bladder-augmentation group than the transplant-only group at both 6 months (82% vs 23%) and 2 years (44% vs 9%). Corresponding rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria at these time points were 91% vs 9% and 78% vs 9%. Conclusion: The performance of bladder augmentation as part of the kidney-transplant procedure in children with LUTA does not seem to endanger short-term graft outcome. UTIs are more common after kidney transplantation combined with bladder augmentation than kidney transplantation alone and may contribute to rapid loss of graft function starting in the third post-transplantation year.Abstract# P-SAT402 Successful Familial kidney transplant in less than 10 kgs : kidney failure from birth till kidney transplantChebl C Mourani 1 , Maroun Moukarzel 1 , Choueri Elie 1 , Joumana Alame 2 , Bernard Gerbaka 1 1 Pediatrics, St Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon 2 Pediatrics, CMC hospital, Beirut, LebanonObjectives, Methods and Results: We report the case of a Lebanese infant born by normal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation. Weight and height at birth were 3200 grams and 49 cm respectively. Serum creatinine in the first week of life was 323 mmol/l . Kidney ultrasound confirmed antenatal diagnosis of hypoplastic small kidneys. Conservative treatment of renal failure was initiated from the first days of life. Conservative management of renal failure included careful attention to fluid balance, maintenance of adequate nutrition and correction of hyperkalemia, acidosis hyperphosphatemia and prevention of renal osteodystrophy by the use of dietary phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs. After a slight decrease of serum creatinine in the first 3 months of life, Serum Creatinine progressively increased despite conservative treatment associated to hyperkaliemia and severe pruritis due to hyperphosphatemia . Decision to start automated peritoneal dialysis at 9 months of life. Weight and height were respectively 6200 grams and 63 cm respectively. Serum Creatinine was 432mmol/l. Pruritis improved after starting peritoneal dialysis as well as appetite. At 17 months of life with 9.7 kg, a familial kidney transplant was performed. Immunosuppresive treatment included Simulect on day 1 and 4 associated to MMF,Tacrolymus and prednisolone. The immediate post transplant period was complicated by urinay tract infection due to E.Coli. After five episodes of UTI due to resistant E. Coli associated to non obstructive stone of 15 mm in the allograft kidney, we performed 2 sessions of lithotripsy . Biochemical urinary studies did not reveal any causes to the calculi. Stone disappeared as well as UTI after lithotripsy. Renal function is normal for age one year after the kidney transplant. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a successful kidney transplant in a lebanese infant with kidney failure since birth with kidney transplant performed at less than 10 kgs of weight on the transplant day. Peritoneal dialysis is the treatment of choice for infants with CKD from birth. Familial or cadaveric kidney transplant should be encouraged and performed in less than 10 kgs allowing normal growth as well as social and school integration.Abstract# P-SAT403 Triple Non-Steroidal Maintenance Therapy In A Cohort Of Kidney Transplanted Children Ramon Vilalta, Enrique Lara, Alvaro Madrid, Marina Mu\u00f1oz, Sara Chocron, Gema Ariceta Paediatric Nephrology, Hosp Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, SpainObjective: Calcineuric inhibitors (CNI) avoidance or dose reduction has been proposed in pediatric kidney transplant (KTx) recipients with nephrotoxicity or neurologic side effects. Combination of CNI, imTOR, and MMF given in low doses seems to be rational. We present the outcome of a cohort treated with this regimen after 30+/-18 months. Methods: 12 children of 14.04\u00b12.45 years and KTx recipients treated with FK and MMF and steroids were transferred to a triple regimen (FK, imTOR, and MMF), with reduced FK dose and without corticosteroids, at 14 (7.5-70.5) months [md(perc 25 th -75 th )] after transplant. 3 patients had a biopsy-proved CNI related toxicity, while 2 exhibited severe tremor, and 1 gingival hypertrophy. In 6 patients, IS was electively changed. Results: Mean FK trough levels were reduced from 9.73\u00b11.53 to 4.18 \u00b11.47 ng/mL (p<0.001), whereas MMF levels remained stable from baseline 3.59\u00b10.57, to the last control 3.33\u00b10.79 (ns). Further, SRL initial levels dropped from 6.9\u00b11.13 to 3.85\u00b10.78 (p<0.001). Interestingly, renal function remained stable in all cases with initial plasma Cr 0.87\u00b10.2, final 0.85\u00b10.2 mg/dl (ns), and mild to null proteinuria: 12.5\u00b13.12 v. 8.52\u00b13.55 mg/m2/h (p= 0.008). No rejection episodes or viral infections were detected. Oral ulcers were seen in half cases, but solved after imTOR dose reduction. Conclusion: Our results suggest that triple IS regimen minimizing CNI may be an alternative treatment in some pediatric KTx recipients. Large series studies are needed to better know the long-term outcome.Abstract# P-SAT404 National prospective multi-centre study of decline of kidney offers for prospective paediatric renal transplant recipientsJodie H Frost 1 , E Jane Tizard 2 , Lisa Mumford 3 , Stephen David Marks 1 1 Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK 2 Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK 3 NHS Blood and Transplant, Bristol, UKObjective: Paediatric renal transplant recipients (PRTR) often have complex anatomy and/or history and require optimal donor organs as may require retransplantation in the future. This prospective study looks at the reason for all declined offers across the United Kingdom. Methods: Prospective study of NHS Blood and Transplant and UK Transplant declined offers for DBD (donation after brain death) kidney donors to all ten paediatric renal transplant centres in the United Kingdom (UK) from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011. All centres submitted a supplementary form for all declined offers. Primary and secondary reasons for declined offers were recorded as well as additional reasoning. Eventual outcome of the declined graft was recorded as well as donor and recipient age, weight and height for those grafts transplanted. Cost analysis was undertaken with regard to the difference of current renal replacement therapy for those patients with declined offers. Results: In total, there was 100% return rate of data on 62 offers for individual paediatric patients from 51 donors (102 potential kidneys) which were declined in the UK. Nationally, 46% of all offers were declined although across individual centres this ranged from 22% to 75%. The commonest primary reason was donor size in 11% (7) cases with donor medical history 6% (4); the supplementary data correlated with the data on the UK Transplant Registry in 84% of cases. 77% (79) kidneys went on to be successfully transplanted with 20% (16 of 79) allocated to other paediatric patients. Cost analysis showed a potential annual difference of \u20ac309,256 spent on haemodialysis for potential recipients whose organ offers were declined and \u20ac78,224 for peritoneal dialysis annually. Conclusion: Our study suggests that organ allocation in the paediatric population continues to have a degree of variability across centres in the UK. Acceptance of renal allografts and the reason for declined offers should have a more robust and evidence based practice. This is especially important where donor size is used as the reason with the potential of living donors being excluded for those patients (especially the youngest recipients who may be on dialysis).Abstract# P-SAT405 Transition and transfer of adolescent renal transplant recipients from paediatric to adult nephrological care Katia Toledo Perdomo 1 , Suzanne Bradley 1 , Rachel Johnson 2 , Stephen David Marks 1 1 Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK 2 NHS Blood and Transplant, Bristol, UK Objective: The literature states that 30% of renal allografts are lost when patients are transferred to adult nephrology units. The aim was to report the patient and renal allograft survival in paediatric renal transplant recipients (RTR) when they are transferred into the care of adult nephrology units. Methods: Retrospective review of the patient and renal allograft survival and influencing factors in the 496 children transplanted between 1973 and 2011 and the 159 transferred into adults from a single centre in the United Kingdom, with a minimum of one year follow-up. Results: 496 children had received a total of 579 transplants; 172 were living-related donations. The median age at transplantation was 12.3 (range 2 -17) years. 63 children required a second and 10 a third transplant before transfer to an adult unit with 101 transplant patients are currently under paediatric follow-up. 159 patients have been transferred to adult nephrology units. The median age when they were transferred was 17.4 (range 16 -19) years. 64% had congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract. The outcome for successful transplantation is improving in the last decade. The overall patient and renal allograft survival were 97.5% and 86.5% at follow up of 5 -266 (median 84.34 +/-53.87) months after transfer to adult nephrology units. Conclusion:The outcome for successful transplantation is improving in the last decade. We note that 13.5% of renal allografts were lost and the overall patient and renal allograft were 97.5 % and 86.5 % after transfer to adult nephrology units.

Fractalkine is a membrane-bound chemokine that mediates chemotaxis through the fractalkine receptor. Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M (C) and Fractalkine Receptor ACI V249I (G) genes were associated with inflammation. We have investigated the association of genetic polymorphisms of fractalkine receptor encoding genes with the outcomes after pediatric renal transplantation. Methods: 62 children with renal transplant and 96 healthy children were enrolled in the study. Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M and ACI V249I gene polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR and restriction length fragment polymorphism.Allelic prevalence was compared with reference values of control group and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested.Results: Urological problems were the leading causes of chronic renal disease in our study. The frequency of Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M (CC) allele was occurred higher in patients and control groups. The frequency of Fractalkine Receptor ACI V249I (GG) allele was occurred higher in control group compared with patients. Twenty two (35%) patients developed acute rejection. Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M (CC) allele was occurred higher in patients with rejection when compared with patients without rejection. Any association between Fractalkine Receptor ACI V249I and rejection has not been shown. Eight patients (13%) have lost their grafts. Frequencies of Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M (CC) and Fractalkine Receptor ACI V249I (GG) alleles were higher in patients with graft loss when compared with patients without graft loss. Conclusion: These results suggest that Fractalkine Receptor BSMBI T280M and Fractalkine Receptor ACI V249I gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk of acute rejection and graft loss. Different approach of treatment such as fractalkine receptor blockade strategies could reduce or finish renal damage in acute and chronic rejection.Abstract# P-SAT407 THE ROLE OF SERUM GGT LEVELS AND OBESITY IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION OUTCOME Esra Baskin, Umut Bayrakci, Asli Kantar, Kaan Gulleroglu, Sibel Kinik, Mahir Kirnap, Gokhan Moray, Mehmet Habera Ped Nephrology, Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey General Surgery, Baskent University, Ankara, TurkeyObjective: The number of obese kidney transplant recipients has been growing, however, there are conflicting results regarding to the effect of obesity on kidney transplantation outcome.

Records were extracted from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA). Outcomes were timing of the first transplant, and whether this kidney came from a deceased or living donor. Predictors were: self-reported race, age, weight, primary kidney disease and timing of referral to nephrological care. Uptake of transplantation was assessed using competing risk regression. Results: 823 patients started renal replacement therapy and 687 patients (83.5%) received at least one kidney graft during the study period. 61% of all primary grafts were from a living donor and 86% of living donors were parents. 129 patients (15.7%) received a preemptive live-donor transplant and 8 (1.0%) received a pre-emptive deceased-donor transplant. Caucasian patients were the most likely to receive a transplant.

It surpasses all other renal replacement therapies economically as wells as in terms of quality of life. Graft outcome in children is still a problem and risk factors influencing better outcome are needed to be evaluated.The aim of the study is to assess some risk factors on graft survival in children in Lithuania after kidney transplantation after 1 and 5 years. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 51 kidney transplantations in 47 children in the period of 1996 and 2011 was done. It was assesed if the following factors: graft type (living or deceased donors), donor's age and sex, HLA compatibility and cold-ischaemia time had influence on graft survival after 1 and 5 years. Graft survival was evaluated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ml/min/1.73m 2 : good \u226590, impared 89-16 and no function \u226415. Statistical analysis was performed with software SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. Results: There were 52.9% male and 24 47.1% female patients with mean age 12.7\u00b13.4 years (3.9 -17.6). Mean donor age was 35.6\u00b115.3, 41.2% were female and 29.4% were male donors. There were 20 (39.2%) living related and 31 (60.8%) deceased transplants. Mean cold-ischaemia time was 17.6\u00b15.2 hours (5-31). After 1 year transplant was good function in 31.4%, impaired in 58.8% and no function in 9.8% cases, accordingly after 5 year period: 45.2%, 48.4% and 6.5 % (p<0.001 and p=0.006). There were no differences in transplant survival and function either from living or deceased donors. Graft type, donor age, sex, ischemia time and HLA mismatches had no influence on transplant function after 1 and 5 years. Conclusion: more risk factors need to be evaluated for better understanding and improving transplant outcome.Abstract# P-SAT419 ABO-incompatible pediatric kidney transplantation without splenectomy, using rituximab and plasmapheresis: a single center experience Tatsuo Asano, Kei Nishiyama, Mamiko Suehiro, Noriko Sugawara, Kiyonobu Ishizuka, Masataka Hisano, Hiroko Chikamoto, Yuko Akioka, Motoshi Hattori Tokyo Women's Medical University, Pediatric Nephrology, Tokyo, Japan",

We aim to study the relationship between DSA and graft loss amongst our cohort of paediatric renal transplant recipients (RTR). Methods: DSA was measured prospectively at 6-12 monthly intervals and during acute graft dysfunction using Luminex bead assays beginning from January 2006. A positive result was defined as median fluorescent intensity >1000. Histology was classified according to Banff '09 criteria. Results: 258 renal transplants were performed between 1/1/2003 and 28/2/2012. All RTR were flow cytometry T-and B-cell crossmatch negative. 96 RTR were transitioned to adult care. Data was available for 160/162 (99%) of the remaining patients with a median follow-up period of 4.72 (range 0.49-15.84) years. Patient survival was 100%.

Methods: We report the results of 12 kidney transplants from living related donors performed between June 2007 and March 2013. They were all performed in Ibn Rochd Hospital of Casablanca with the active support of the kidney transplant team's of Robert Debr\u00e9 Hospital-APHP in Paris.Results: The sex ratio of recipients was 0.5, mean age 11 years(5.5 to  15.5), mean weight 30 kg (13-50), and mean weight donor/recipient ratio was 2.7 (1.5 to 5.3). Immunosuppressive treatment included: basiliximab, tacrolimus, MMF and steroids (ST) in 9 patients with ST withdrawal at day 7 in 8 patients and at 6 months in 1 ; basiliximab, CsA, MMF and ST in 2 patients with ST withdrawal at 19 and 27 months; ATG, tacrolimus, MMF and ST in 1 patient with ST withdrawal at 6 months. There were no delayed graft function and we observed surgery complications in 3 patients). Graft rejection occurred in 1 case at 3 years post-transplant because of non compliance. Viral infections was common (5 to CMV, 5 to EBV and 1 to BKV) and other main complication occurred in the post operative period (1 pneumonia, 1 pericardial tamponade, 1 hemothorax and 1 peritonitis); At present, with a mean follow-up of XXX months (6 to 70) the patients and grafts survival is 100% with a mean serum creatinine of 80\u03bcmol/l (46 to 123). Conclusion: Renal transplantation in children in Morocco is now feasible with very encouraging results. The continuation and development of this activity is essential to optimize the care of children with chronic kidney disease.Abstract# P-SAT423 Belarus Pediatric Renal Transplantation: one of the successful program on the postsovietunion spaces S.

Valiok 1 1 National Center for Pediatric Nephrology and Renal Replacement Therapy, Minsk, Belarus 2 National Center for Organs and Tissues Transplantation, Minsk, BelarusObjective: Kidney transplantation is the best renal replacement modality for end stage renal disease especially in pediatric population. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of pediatric renal transplant program in Belarus including all children treated between April 2009 (start the program) and January 2012. Methods: This study concluded 56 children (49 byelorussians and 7 foreigners). All transplanted patients were followed in pediatric nephrology center. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate graft survival following transplant. Results: A total 56 children: 32 girls, 24 boys, aged 3,67-17,75 (median 13.67) years. 83,9% had a kidney from deceased donors, 1.8%-preemptive. Main reason of brain death was craniocerebral trauma (in 60.7%), mainly man 76.8% and adult 95.7% with age 18-50 (median 35) years. Median waiting time was 5 (1-24) month. 46.4% of the grafts were intra-peritoneal. 26.8% had a post-operative complication and 5.4% had an episode of acute rejection. Primary function was seen in 80.4%, 16% had delayed function and 3.6% had primary non-function. The immunosuppression was the same in all patients: daclizumab or basiliximab, Tac+MMF+Pred. The underlying diseases were congenital and hereditary in 32 (57.1%): dysplastic, hypoplastic kidneys in 11, obstructive uropathies in 10, nephrophthisis -6 and neurogenic bladder -5, others in 13 and 11 had acquired diseases.14.3% of transplanted children had bladder augmentation with ileal and Mitrofanoff procedure and 14.3% used intermittent bladder catheterization or medications. The median GFR (Schwartz formula) at discharge, 1, 2 years was63.7 (27.9-97.4), 65.3 (38.6-93.9), 71.1  (55.8-83.5) ml/min/1.73m 2 . Overall patient survival and transplant survival at 1 year was 100% and 94.6%, respectively. Prevalent counts of pediatric transplanted patients increased from 2.3 (in 2008) to 19.7 (in 2012) per million 0-17 years population (p<0.001).

Conclusion: IDO is activated in kidney transplanted patients, in agreement with the activation of innate immunity (TLRs) and IFN-gamma mediated pathway and its activity decreases under the chronic effect of immunosuppressants. IDO is an interesting new marker of the immunological balance in transplanted patients.Abstract# P-SAT440Risk factors predisposing urinary tract infection and it's influence on graft function in children after renal transplantationHerkus Bajercius 1 , Rimante Cerkauskiene 1, 2 , Augustina Jankauskiene 1, 2 1 Medical faculty, Vilnius university, Vilnius, Lithuania 2 Children hospital, Vilnius university hospital \"Santariskiuklinikos\", Vilnius, LithuaniaObjective: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections after kidney tranplantation (KTx) and despite adequate antibiotic prophylaxis is still a problem. Main risk factors for UTI to develop are: anatomic abnormalities and transplanted graft, surgical handling, remaining urinary bladder catheters and intra-ureteric stents post-transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess several factors possibly influencing the prevalence of post-transplant UTI and it's influence on graft function. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of 27 kidney transplant recipients in the period from 2000 to 2012 was done. Mean follow-up time was up to 5 years. The following factors were evaluated: cause of renal failure (congenital abnormalities and other), UTI prior KTx, presence/absence of urine prior KTx, presence/absence of native kidneys after KTx, presence/absence of intra-ureteric stents after KTx. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.Kaplan Meier method for the prognostic factors was used. Results: Patients' gender predisposition: 55.6% (15) were male and 44.4% (12) were female with mean age at KTx 12.7\u00b14. 7 years. Over the follow-up period 66.7 % of children (91.7 % boys, 50% girls) suffered from UTI. Recipients with other causes of kidney insufficiency had UTI more often than congenital abnormalities, p<0.05. Boys more frequently had UTI RR 11.0 (1.4-85.2, p< 0.05) as well as older than 16 year old patients during the follow-up period; p< 0.001). Native kidneys, stents had no influence on UTI. Anuria and UTI before KTx had influence on UTI (p< 0.05). UTI had no influence on transplant function. Conclusion: UTI is more frequent infection after KTx for older patients and boys. Anuria and UTI before KTx influenced frequency of UTI, but UTI had no influence on transplant function.

            "text": "Objective: Bisphosphonates are widely used in the management of children with steroid induced osteoporosis (SIO). With the increasing use of bisphosphonates, there have been reports of abnormal radiological findings in the growing skeleton. Therefore, their use in pediatric patients remains controversial. The present study was conducted to evaluate the long term follow-up results of radiographic features especially metaphyseal sclerotic lines, associated with pamidronate therapy in pediatric patients with nephropathy. Methods: Twenty two children with nephropathy receiving oral calcium and pamidronate (mean duration: 7.9 months, dose: 125mg daily) were evaluated restrospectively. All Patients had SOI because of chronic glucocorticoid therapy for the treatment of nephropathy. Biochemical tests, long bone radiography and bone mineral density (BMD) were performed before the treatment of pamidronate and followed up several years later. The physeal growth rates were estimated by measuring the distance that the sclerotic lines moved on the radiographs during the corresponding time intervals. Results: The mean follow-up period was 9.5 years. In all patients, the well-defined sclerotic lines at the metaphyseal ends were observed and progressively moved from physeal plate to diaphysis on the radiographs of long bones. The mean moving rates of the sclerotic lines was 7.95 mm per year and in twelve patients, the lines disappeared. And the mean growth rate of height was 4.50 cm per year. Conclusion: Our long-term follow-up results suggest that the metaphyseal sclerotic lines associated with pamidronate treatment tend to disappear without affecting the skeletal growth. Bisphosphonate treatment for SOI in pediatric patients with nephropathy seems to be safe although further studies for larger number of patients are needed Abstract# P-SAT366 Clinical effectiveness and safety of the high dose active vitamin D therapy on severe hyperparathyroidism in children with ESRD Eun Gu Kang, Su-Yon Kim, Joo Hoon Lee, Young Seo Park Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea Objective: A potent inhibiting effect of active vitamin D on parathyroid hormone is well known, but there is uncertainty on the dose to be used in hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of high dose active vitamin D treatment on severe hyperparathyroidism in children with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: Fifty-four patients underwent dialysis for more than 1 year between May 2002 and Feb 2013 in Asan Medical Center. Among them, patients who were administered high dose of active vitamin D (dose of alfacalcidol 1mcg/day to 3mcg/day) with severe hyperparathyroidism(intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) >800pg/mL) were selected. Changes of iPTH, plasma albumin-corrected calcium, phosphorus and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D were analysed. Results: Fourteen patients (10 boys and 4 girls) with median age of 12.5 years (6-19 years) were included. The mean duration of dialysis was 49\u00b132 months and the median duration of the high dose alfacalcidol therapy was 5 months(3-22months). The iPTH level significantly decreased in 10 patients (71%) from 1206.3\u00b1387.6 to 215.2\u00b1117 during the high dose alfacalcidol therapy (p<0.001). Serum phosphorus (5.9\u00b11.3mg/dL vs. 6.0\u00b11.8mg/dL, p=0.88) and calciumphosphorus product (53.4\u00b111.9mg2/dL2 vs. 59.8\u00b118.4mg2/dL2, p=0.20) were not significantly changed and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D was low or normal after therapy. Plasma albumin-corrected calcium significantly increased (9.4\u00b10.64mg/dL vs. 10.2\u00b10.75mg/dL, p=0.016). Four patients (29%) had persistent severe hyperparathyroidism despite treatment with high dose of alfacalcidol, which was controlled after kidney transplantation (2 patients) or after parathyroidectomy (2 patients).Conclusion: High dose active vitamin D therapy controlled severe hyperparathyroidism in the most children with ESRD without significant adverse events.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the vitamin D status in 3 groups of children and adolescents with CKD and to establish the association between 25(OH) vitamin D (25OHD) levels, age, hyperparathyroidism, short stature, and renal function. Methods: We recruited 105 children: 44 renal transplant patients with a functioning graft for at least 6 months (mean age 12 yr, mean graft Abstract# P-SAT386 The expression and significance of IL-6 \u3001IP-10 and IL-17 in serum and synovial fluid with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Objective: To detect the disparity of three cytokines about Interleukin-6(IL-6),Interferon-inducible protein 10(IP-10) and in peripheral blood(PB) and synovial fluid(SF) of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Method: Serum concentrations of the three cytokines were measured in 27 patients with 13 systemic-onset JIA(sJIA), 14 polyarticular JIA(pJIA) and 28 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA). 19 patients being no marked arthritis symptom or only temporary arthralgia enrolled in probable sJIA group. SF from 18 patients with 7 sJIA,11pJIA were examined for cytokine levels. Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate serum concentrations of ghrelin and leptin, and their associations with fat mass and insulin homeostasis in children undergoing chronic dialysis. Methods: The study population consisted of 40 patients on maintenance dialysis (22 PD and 18 HD) aged between 5-19 years and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy children. Serum levels of total ghrelin and leptin were measured in all patients and controls. Fasting serum glucose and insulin levels were also measured in the patients; insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Nutritional status was assessed by measuring body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Body fat mass was estimated by the BIA method. Results: The mean total ghrelin level was significantly higher in the patients than the controls (1671\u00b11317 vs. 543\u00b1365 pg/mL, p<0.001). Higher total ghrelin levels in dialysis patients were significantly associated with younger age (p=0.015), lower BMI-SDS (p=0.050) and lower BIA-based fat mass-z score (p=0.007). The mean leptin level was also higher in dialysis patients compared to the controls but the difference was not statistically significant (15.5\u00b129.2 vs. 6.48\u00b15.51 ng/mL). However, the ratio of leptin levels to fat mass was significantly higher in dialysis patients than the controls (1.16\u00b11.31 vs. 0.50\u00b10.12, p=0.041). Serum levels of leptin in dialysis patients positively correlated with BMI-SDS, TSF-z score and BIA-based fat mass-z score (p<0.001 for all). Serum leptin levels also had a positive correlation with serum insulin (p=0.001) and HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and an inverse correlation with total ghrelin level (p=0.005). Conclusion: Children on maintenance dialysis have high levels of total ghrelin that are closely related to decreased fat mass and poor nutritional status. In contrast to ghrelin, leptin is associated with increased fat mass and insulin resistance; however, these patients have inappropriately elevated leptin levels in relation to body fat mass that may be related to wasting. Objective: This study investigated the influence of social support and other psychosocial factors upon mortality, adherence to medical care recommendations, and physical QoL amongst hemodialysis patients. Method: 272 HD patients were examined using the QoL questionnaire to determine self-reported inclinations. Logistics regression through Weighted K was used to analyze data. Results: 53.5% of patients reported health had interfered with their social activities demonstrating a strong associated with risk towards All-Cause (sp=1.33) and Cause-Specific Mortality including cardiac diseases (sp=1.28). These patients had a greater risk of withdrawing (sp=1.67) from treatment, non-adherence to Phosphorus (sp=1.06) greater than 7.5 mg/dL and increased risk towards an albumin of less than 3.5 g/dL (sp=1.23). Patients reporting dissatisfied with family support (12.0%) were at highest risk to non-adherence to intra-dialytic weight gain (sp=1.27), shortening the dialysis session (sp=1.21) and increased risk of Potassium level greater than 6 mEq/L (sp=1.14). However, patients reporting dissatisfied with staff support (14.1%) revealed a higher risk of decreased physical QoL (sp=0.76). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that physical QoL was not only affected by medications and other laboratory work-ups but also with additional psychosocial support. The study led to the development of programs empowering patients and families to participate in their treatment plans. The program includes various counselling approaches directed to patient, families, and health team. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze health-related quality of live (HRQoL) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) dependent on the CKD stage, treatment modality and selected social life elements in families of the patients. Furthermore, potential differences between self-and parent/proxy reports and the factors influencing them were assessed. Methods: 203 CKD children (on hemodialysis-HD, peritoneal dialysis-PD and conservative treatment-CT) and their 388 parentproxies were enrolled into a cross-sectional national study. A semistructured interview form was used to determine the demographic and social characteristics of the participants. We used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales to assess the HRQoL in children.",

            "text": "Results: HRQoL scores for all CKD groups were significantly lower in all domains compared with population norms, the lowest one being in the HD group. In CT children, HRQoL did not depend on the CKD stage. Children with CKD reported problems with education and emotional functioning. Both parents assessed the HRQoL of their children differently depending on their involvement in the care. There are differences between the HRQoL scores of the children and their parents. Conclusion: The HRQoL in children with CKD is lower than in healthy children. This is already observed in the early stages of the disease. The disease itself influences the child's mental state. Children on HD require special support on account of the lowest demonstrated overall HRQoL. Children's lower rating of the quality of life observed by their parents may render the patients unmotivated and adversely affect their adjustment to life in later years. It may also create conflicts between the parents and the children. Objective: Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. The aims of the study were: to investigate the level of anxiety in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to identify factors associated with the presence of that emotional problem. Methods: CKD children on hemodialysis (HD, n=22), peritoneal dialysis (PD, n=20,) and on conservative treatment (CT, n=95), and healthy subjects (n=100) were enrolled in the study. We used State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for adolescents and STAI-C for children. Socio-demographic and physical factors were assessed. Results: There was a significantly higher level of anxiety-state among HD children (8-12 years) compared with other groups of participants of the same age. The level of anxiety among adolescents (13-18 years), both anxiety-state and anxiety-trait, was significantly higher in the HD group compared with other groups, which did not differ among themselves. In the HD adolescents, there was a correlation between the anxiety-state and the duration of the disease as well as with the number of hospitalizations. PD adolescents in the mainstream education had higher levels of anxietystate and anxiety-trait compared with home schooled patients. Conclusion: Even though children and adolescents with CKD are at risk of developing a variety of emotional disorders, the level of anxiety among the researched group, with the exception of HD patients, was not significantly different than the level of anxiety among healthy subjects. Adolescents on HD who present a high level of anxiety should undergo long-term psychological treatment.",

Methods: Records of the patients transplanted in our center between 1990 and 2011 were screened and patients who remained in the program by their 18th birthday were included in the analysis. Adherence and graft function were assessed for the period of 2 years prior and 2 years after transition. Undetectable and/or sub-therapeutic levels of calcineurin inhibitors and their level variability were used as measures of adherence. Graft survival analysis was performed for the period of 4 years before and 4 years after transition. Results: Out of 197 screened patients, 71 were eligible and 25 of them were transitioned (TG -transitioned group). The remaining 46 patients were used as a comparison group (CG), 27 of them did not reach the age of transition by the time of the analysis. The median age at transplantation was 17.7 [15.1-19.1] years in the TG and 15.8 [13.5-17.6] years in the CG, median age at transition was 22. 5 [21.7-23 .3] years. Overall, there was no significant difference in adherence within TG before and after transition (p=0.5 for low drug levels and p=0.6 for drug levels variability); however, patients with lower pre-transition adherence (tertile I) showed improvement of their adherence following transition when compared with those with high pre-transition adherence (tertile III), p=0.02. There were 4 graft losses per 67.9 patient-years in TG vs 19 losses per 102.4 person-years in CG (p=0.02). The peak graft loss in all pediatric transplant recipients in our center (n=105 losses) occurred 3 years (SD 5.7 years) prior to the transition. Conclusion: At our institution, transition was not associated with worsening adherence or graft loss. This may be in part do to the fact that the transition occurred at a later age than in other institutions.",

Methods: Seventy four kidney transplanted children without any shown HLA antibody in the pre-transplant period were enrolled in the study. Their anti HLA antibody status was checked by Luminex during post transplant period and its relation with the graft function and prognosis of the patients is studied. Results: Mean age of the patients was 13.5\u00b15.2 years. Mean follow-up time was 3.8\u00b11.1 years. Pre-transplant cytotoxicity tests and PRA was negative in all patients. Nine (12.1%) patients were found to have anti HLA antibodies after kidney transplantation. Mean time for the detection of antibodies was found as 11\u00b14.8 months. Patients with anti HLA antibodies were similar with patients without antibodies in the terms of age, sex, HLA mismatch, transfusions and immunosuppressive drugs as well as the presence of viral infections. Mean serum creatinine level was found to be higher in patients with anti HLA antibodies. The antibody mediated rejection rate was found to be 7.2% (5/65) in patients without anti HLA antibodies while it was 55.1% (5/9) and remained dialysis dependent. All 6 were dialysis dependent by 6 months post diagnosis. Time from ANCA GN diagnosis to kidney transplant (Mean\u00b1SD) was 31\u00b112 months (range 17 -48 months). All patients received induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppression with prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Median duration of follow up post transplantation was 3.5 years (range 1.25 -6.9). eGFR at last follow up was 71.9 \u00b1 34.7 ml/min/1.73m 2 (range 5.7 -100.5). 1 patient lost her transplant to biopsy-proven, severe acute cellular rejection due to complete non-adherence to medications after 21 months of stable transplant function. No patient had recurrence of vasculitis. Conclusion: Short-term patient and allograft survival in paediatric patients with ESKD secondary to ANCA GN is excellent despite aggressive disease, with no recurrence of vasculitis post transplant.Abstract# P-SAT429 En-bloc kidneys from infant donors less than 5 kg transplantation into pediatric recipients at school age Objective: Given the shortage of donor kidneys in China, the use of grafts from deceased infant donors (weight < 5kg) is a potential approach to expand the donor pool. In this study, we reviewed the results of the first cohort of en bloc kidney transplantation of infant donors to pediatric recipients at school age in our center.Methods: From February 2012 to March 2013, 4 infant en bloc kidney transplants in pediatric recipients were performed in our center. En bloc kidneys from 4 infant donors (Maastricht Category III) who died of severe congenital disease were recovered and donated to the Red Cross Society of Tianjin and allocated to our center by China Organ Transplant Response System (CORTS). Donor age ranged from 33 to 56 days with weight ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 kg. Recipients included 2 females and 2 males with age ranging from 5 to 11 yr. The en bloc graft was implanted extraperitoneally in the right iliac fossa. The distal end of the donor aorta was anastomosed end-to-end to the internal iliac artery, while the donor vena cava was anastomosed to the external iliac vein. The donor ureters were implanted separately onto the bladder with double-J stents placement. After the operation, the recipients received basiliximab as an induction therapy. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus and Myfortic. Prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin was used for the first week after transplantation. Results: Patient survival was 100%. Complications included delayed graft function in 1 patient (managed by PD for one week), urine leak in 1, and anticoagulation-related hemorrhage in 1. Due to discontinued anticoagulation, one graft was lost early from vascular thrombosis. Of the remaining 3 recipients, all had immediate and excellent long-term function with average creatinine of 1.13\u00b10.31 mg/dL at 5 months follow-up (range 1-12 months). Conclusion: This is the first report of en bloc kidney transplantation from infant donors into pediatric recipients in China. Many improvements by our transplant teams had improved the survival of patients and grafts. Based on our experience, albeit very limited, we concluded that favorable outcomes can be obtained from en bloc transplantation from infant donors. Objective: To describe the rates and outcomes of renal transplantation in children with intellectual disability (ID). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all children receiving a first kidney alone transplant in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) dataset from January 1, 2008 to October 31, 2011. Recipients with definite, probable, and without ID were compared using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Kaplan Meier curves were constructed for patient and graft survival. Results: Over the study period, 218 children with definite (90) or probable (128) intellectual disability underwent first renal transplant accounting for 17% of all first pediatric renal transplants (total n=1280). Children with definite or probable ID did not significantly differ from other recipients on the basis of gender or ethnicity but tended to be younger. Children with definite ID had higher rates of structural kidney disease and lower rates of glomerulonephritis. Children with ID were not significantly different than children without ID with respect to rate of preemptive transplant, donor source, or number of episodes of acute rejection. Graft and patient survival were similar between children with definite or probable ID and without ID. In Cox regression, intellectual disability was not significantly associated with patient or graft survival. Conclusion: In this first large-scale study, 17% of all first pediatric renal transplants are performed in children identified as having intellectual disability. Early outcomes after transplant appear to be equivalent between children with and without ID. Further research is needed on long-term outcomes and quality of life effects of transplant in this population.",

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study through analysis of medical records of patients below 18 years submitted to renal transplant were performed. Data were analyzed in SPSS, version 19.0. The results were expressed by descriptive variables and survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between subgroups were made using the log-rank test. P level was set at below 5%. Results: We analyzed 64 patients who underwent 66 transplants. The mean age was 10.5 \u00b1 3.9 years. The main causes of chronic kidney disease were CAKUT (32.8%) and glomerular diseases (26.6%). Most patients were submitted to dialysis before transplantation (81.9%) with a mean duration of 36.5 \u00b1 25.5 months. Deceased donor was used in 57.6% and the average cold ischemia time was 22.2 \u00b1 6.3 hours. Dialysis after renal transplantation was performed in 22.7% of cases. The median survival of patients 1, 5 and 10 years was 98.3%, 95.8% and 92.8%. There were four deaths in this population, two after graft loss. Twelve patients lost their grafts (19.7%). The median survival of the graft was 9.2 years and 1, 5 and 10 years survival was 91.7%, 81.2% and 75.6%, respectively. No statistical difference was detected in graft survival between the deceased versus. living donor recipients, the different age groups, the occurrence of hypertension or not, the preemptive transplantation vs. preceded by dialysis (p=0.97) and those with more than three versus less than three HLA mismatches. A significant reduction in graft survival was associated with cold ischemia time associated with 24h, need for dialysis after transplantation, early acute or late rejection and creatinine greater than 1mg per dl after the first year os transplantation. Conclusion: In our center, graft survival was similar to that described in the literature. However, further studies are needed to address the variables that negatively impacted the results of transplantation. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether there is an increase in anti-HLA antibodies after the Influenza A/H1N1 vaccine given to pediatric pts with ESRD on dialysis (D) and with kidney transplant (T). Methods: 21 pediatric pts were enrolled. Mean age was 15.5 years old, 29% female, 71% male, 57% African American, 29% Hispanic.Objective: PTLD is the most common malignancy and important complication of pediatric solid organ transplantation. The rates of PLTD have been increasing through 1990s in KTx recipients. We conducted a survey of PTLD in children who received KTx since the introduction of Tac. Methods: From 1975, KTx was performed in 463 recipients at our center. Among them, we analyzed data from children who had undergone KTx since the introduction of Tac and retrospectively studied incidence of PTLD and risk factors, including immunosuppression protocol and pre-KTx EBV serology. Results: We retrieved the data of 188 pediatric recipients since 1997 (110 boys, median age at KTx 8.2 years, living KTx 170, pre-emptive KTx 26, EBV-seronegative 82). Among them, 11 cases (10 EBVrelated, 1 non-EBV) of PTLD were diagnosed in 10 recipients (5.3%), and all cases were EBV-seronegative at KTx. The median duration from KTx to the onset of PTLD was 7 months (range: 4-101 months). The most common presenting symptom of PTLD was abdominal complaints in 9 cases, followed by fever in 3, superficial lymphadenopathy in 3 and nasal congestion in 1. Immunosuppressants were reduced in all cases; the subsequent treatment consisted of antiviral agents + IVIG (3/11), anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (5/11), and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody + chemotherapy (2/11). Only one recipient died due to PTLD. Assessing the correlation between PTLD and immunosuppressants in 82 EBV-seronegative recipients (median age at KTx 5.7 years, CyA 39, Tac 43, MZR 26, MMF 56, IL-2 receptor antibody 56), a significantly higher incidence of PTLD was associated with Tac (9/43) than CyA (1/39) [OR 18.3, p=0 .003] in multiple logistic regression analysis. We compared the incidence of PTLD, median age at KTx, and rate of EBV-seronegativity in 3 eras (A: 1997-2001, B: 2002-2006, C: 2007-2011) of the study period and found 4%/8.2 yrs/32% in A, 3%/7.1 yrs/43% in B, and 10%/9.0 yrs/55% in C. Thus the incidence of PTLD increased with the increase in EBV-seronegative recipients. Conclusion: In our study, maintenance treatment with Tac (compared with CyA) is associated with a higher risk for developing PTLD. Attention should be paid to the increase in the EBV-seronegative recipients.Abstract# P-SAT438 Acute graft dysfunction and encephalitis post renal transplant: the role of Epstein-Barr Virus Objective: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been described as a rare cause of acute kidney injury and encephalitis in children. Methods: We report a case of a 5 year old renal transplant recipient who developed acute graft dysfunction and a significant neurological insult with evidence of primary EBV infection. Results: The patient had been diagnosed with posterior urethral valves prenatally and received a live related renal transplant aged 4 years. Seven months post-transplant he presented fluid overloaded, oliguric, with significant uraemia and hyponatraemia. There was a history of lower urine output and sore throat 4 days before admission with evidence of anaemia with red blood cell fragments, thrombocytopenia, mild monocytosis, raised LDH, ALT and splenomegaly on presentation. Haemodialysis was commenced. Primary EBV infection was subsequently detected by serology and PCR.Renal biopsy showed a picture of acute glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy(figure above) and acute tubular injury secondary to haemoglobinuria.Scanty EBER+ lymphocytes containing EBVencoded small nuclear RNA were also present. Within 3 days of presentation patient deteriorated neurologically developing a reduced conscious level, dysarthria, decreased motor power peripherally and an inability to upward gaze. An MRI brain demonstrated increased T2 signal and mild diffusion restriction in in the caudate nuclei, putamina and ventro-lateral thalami. This picture has been previously described in EBV encephalitis. There was a gradual neurological improvement and by day 7 of admission, and 6 doses of i.v. methylprednisolone, the patient had a full neurological recovery. The number of EBV copies has subsequently decreased on lower dose of immunosuppression. By week 4 after presentation he was no longer dialysis dependent with creatinine 3-fold higher than the previous baseline. Conclusion: This is the first report of acute graft dysfunction and encephalitis due to primary EBV infection in renal transplant recipient.Abstract# P-SAT439 Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (Ido) As A New Immunological Marker In Kidney Elisa Loiacono 1 , Barbara Votta 2 , Alessandro Amore 1 , Licia Peruzzi 1 , Maria Paola Puccinelli 2 , Roberta Camilla 1 , Luca Vergano 1 , Giuliana Guido 3 , Maria Elena Donadi 1 , Rosanna Coppo 1 1 Nephrology, Citt\u00e0della Salute e dellaScienza. Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy 2 Nephrology, Citt\u00e0della Salute e dellaScienza, Turin, Italy 3 Nephrology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, ItalyObjective: The enzyme indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase (IDO), induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ligands in dendritic cells, degrades the essential aminoacid tryptophan (Trp) to kinurenine (Kyn). Its activity is estimated by the ratio of Kyn to Trp concentration (Kyn/Trp).T-cell activation and proliferation are affected by Trp deprivation and accumulation of Kyn. Therefore, activating IDO during immune responses counter balances mechanism of negative feedback loop of IFN-gamma and acts as a tool to downregulate overwhelming immune activation. IDO activation has been reported to be increased in acute rejection and downregulated in vitro by the immunesuppressants adopted for organ transplantation. Objective: To determine the prevalence of mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) use as part of the immunosuppressant regime in our current paediatric renal transplant recipients in a single tertiary paediatric nephrology centre and examine the demography of these cases. Method: Case note and pharmacy record review of all paediatric renal transplant recipients' history, immunosuppressant medication and current renal allograft function in January 2013. Indication for medication switch from mycophenolatemofetil to enteric-coated mycophenolic acid tablets (Myfortic) was noted. Data presented as median (range). Results: 14 (10 male) out of a total of 88 patients with renal transplants are currently receiving Myfortic in our centre. Age and time from transplant was 12.3 (8. 1-17.4 ) years and 4.3 (0.68-10.6) years. The most common cause of end stage renal disease requiring transplantation in this subgroup was posterior urethral valves in 5/14 cases. Two of these recipients had ABO incompatible living related transplants. Current eGFR was 46.7 (20.9-82.3) ml/min/1.73m2. 13/14 patients receiving Myfortic were also receiving prednisolone and tacrolimus as part of their immunosuppression regime. One patient was on tacrolimus and Myforctic only (history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Dosage of Myfortic varied based on patient size from 180mg twice daily to 720mg twice daily. The indication for carrying out a medication switch from mycophenolatemofetil to Myfortic was related to gastrointestinal symptoms in all cases; specifically diarrhoea in 9 cases, abdominal pain in 2 cases and both symptoms in 3 cases. These symptoms improved on Myfortic with renal allograft function remaining stable, however in view of neutropenia in one patient her Myfortic is currently suspended and under review.",

This retrospective report is aimed to evaluate the incidence of UTI in a group of patients attending our hospital for post transplant usual medical controls. Methods and Results: We incuded in our study 75 children who underwent KT between 2000 and 2011: 42 M and 33 F, mean age 11.6 +/-5.3 . Four children received a graft from a living related donor and 71 from a deceased donor. First morning sterile urine sample to the microbiology laboratory was obtained when attending the hospital for its usual medical control or immunesuppressive drug detection levels. Results: in 41 patients (54.7%) ESRD was secondary to CAKUT. Thirty-six patients (48%) presented at least one episode of UTI occurred in the first 6 months after KT, mainly in females (1.2:1) . UTI developed in the first period were caused mainly by Gram negative bacteria (91%). E. Coli was the main agent (66.1%), the other uropathogens involved were: Proteus (9%), Enterobacter Cloacae (9%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (6%), Candida Albicans (3.3%) and Klebsiella (3.3%). Later infections were caused mainly by Candida, Klebsiella, ProteusansdEnterobacterfaecalis. One patient at the 15th month post-transplantation manifested UTI caused by Corinebacterium Urealyticum associated with concretions of baldder mucosae. Eight patients (5M and 3 F) experienced the graft loss: 4 patients were affected by CAKUT and had febrile UTI postTx. One patient left the second graft by a an acute deterioration of renal function during an UTI by BKV. Conclusion: UTI in Kidney transplanted children represent a main complaint as demonstrated by the high incidence (48%) in total population mainly in females. A significant role is played by primary uropathy and immunosuppression as demonstrated by the high frequency also in non uropathic patients. The role of UTI in longterm outcome of KT remains controversial.",

            "text": "Factors associated with elevated pulse wave velocity in children after renal transplantation Objective: Even after successful transplantation children with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) still carry a high cardiovascular risk. This is also documented by cardiovascular death being the second leading cause of death after transplantation in this patient cohort.Methods: In a cross-sectional approach 109 renal transplant recipients at three German transplant centres were enrolled. We measured pulse wave velocity (PWV), a strong predictor for cardiovascular events, as our primary end point. In all participants we assessed classical (e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol) and non-classical (e.g. CRP, PTH) cardiovascular risk parameters. Results: Patients were 13 \u00b1 3 years of age and had received their transplant 5 \u00b1 4 years ago. PWV-SDS adjusted to height was 0.4 \u00b1 1.5. In order to identify predictors of elevated PWV, we performed a univariate screen and introduced factors with a p-value below 0.2 into a stepwise forward linear regression analysis. We found that systolic blood pressure in the ambulatory blood pressure measurement and GFR independently predicted PWV-SDS (table) . Conclusion: Our results show a large variability in aortic stiffness in children after renal transplantation. We found elevated PWV to be associated with classical as well as non-classical risk factors. The wide range of cardiovascular comorbidity seen in these patients highlights the need for individualized risk factor monitoring and management. Objective: Renal transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease in children,. However, it remains technically challenging in small recipients, especially with adult-sized graft. We report on two 4-year-old children, undergoing living donor kidney transplantation, and describe our management after failure to close the abdominal wall. Method: Both children weighed < 15kg and received their father's kidney. The recipient/donor weight ratios were 1/5 and 1/6. Surgical procedure was an extra peritoneal approach to the iliac fossa, with vascular anastomosis on the aorta and vena cava. They recieved intensive fluid replacement during surgery to optimize hemodynamic status and graft perfusion. After initial successful reperfusion, all attempts to close the abdominal wall (even simple skin closure or superficial muscle layer closure) led to graft hypoperfusion, diagnosed on graft colour change and doppler ultrasound. Closure with resorbableVicryl?mesh gave the same results and failure. Finally, we had to close with a synthetic non resorbable plate (Goretex?), without skin closure.Results: The first patient presented acute tubular necrosis and required continuous hemofiltration from day 2 to 6. The second one had immediate diuresis and with a decrease of serum creatinine to 65\u03bcmol/l at day 2. In both cases, kidney was successfully replaced intra abdominally at day 6, with superficial closure of facia and skin in one child and with Vicryl? mesh and skin in the second one. No effect on clinical graft perfusion or Doppler parameters were observed after final closure. In patient 2, a limited necrotic area 3x3cm, on direct contact with the Goretex?plate, was noticed during the second surgery procedure but it remained very superficial. Finally, with a follow-up of respectively 1 year and 1 month, recipients and grafts are doing well without any other events and a serum creatinine of 40-50 \u03bcmol/l. Conclusion: In conclusion, in small patients kidney size discrepancy and tissue oedema can lead to renal allograft compartment syndrome. In this situation, Goretex? plate is an option for initial wound closure and graft salvaging. Objective: AMR in the transplant is one of the most complicated form of rejection, which do not respond to the standard therapy. Survival of the transplant exposed to AMR is still low. This is a clinical report of an AMR-treatment in children in our centre. Methods: 4 girls with AMR after the deceased donor renal transplantation were observed of age10, 13, 15, 16 from 2009 to 2012 in our centre. All had a negative \"cross-match\" at the time of transplantation, the quantity of discordant antigens varied from 3 to 6. For 1 girl it was the 2 transplantation. 3 children had an immediate function of the graft,1-delayed. Induction of the immunosuppressive therapy: polyclonal antibodies and methylprednisolone, maintenance: tacrolimus, prednisolone, MMF. 2 children had high level of preexisting antibodies (more than 30%) at the time of transplantation. There were morphological confirmation and decrease of the graft function for the moment of AMR. The treatment of AMR included: pulse therapy of methylprednisolone, polyclonal antibodies, rituximab, immunoglobulin iv. Function of the graft was evaluated by the Cr levels, GFR, the level of DSA.Results: The Cr of children was 483\u00b1256 umol/l for the moment of developing of AMR. Function of the graft has been restored to satisfied: Cr fall to 121\u00b128 umol/l, there were no proteinuria. It was noted a significant reduction of DSA I and II class in 3 from 4 patients. Conclusion: Thus, treatment of an AMR of the graft with methylprednisolone, rituximab and immunoglobulin intravenously let us achieve 100% 1-year graft and recipient survival after deceased donor kidney transplantation in children. Since the risk of AMRdevelopment is high in children with high levels of preexisting antibodies, addition of one-time rituximab and immunoglobulin intraveneously in therapy seems reasonable.Abstract# P-SAT454 Tacrolimus granules use in kidney transplanted infants. Dose and safety.Ramon Vilalta, Enrique Lara, Alvaro Madrid, Marina Munoz, Sara Chocron, Gema Ariceta Paediatric Nephrology, HospValld'Hebron, Barcelona, SpainObjective: Tacrolimus in infants has been administered as an extemporaneously compounded oral liquid made by hospital pharmacy. Modigraf\u00ae is a new tacrolimus formulation available as sachets containing granules (0.2 mg and 1 mg), that are made up with water, prepared by parents or caregivers. Modigraf\u00ae is considered at least as safe and practical than the compounded oral tacrolimus liquid. Furthermore, it is easier to be stored and ready to use, and promotes patient's autonomy, preventing potential medication errors. 9 kidney transplanted infants, 3 de-novo and 6 converted from oral liquid to Modigraf\u00ae were evaluated to assess its safety and adequate dose. Methods: After induction with Basiliximab or ATG, de novo's3 patients were treated with Modigraf\u00ae associated with MMF and with tapered steroids. 6 infants with similar immunosuppression regimen were converted from oral tacrolimus to Modigraf\u00ae. Target tacrolimus through level was 8-10 ng/ml. Mean patients' age at transplantation was 2.2 years old, and mean follow-up period with Modigraf\u00ae was 10\u00b18 months.Results: In the de-novogroup the stable Modigraf\u00ae dose needed to reach target levels was 0.28\u00b10.12 mg/kg/day. In the converted group, the initial oral tacrolimus liquid dose was 0.20\u00b10.12 mg/kg/day, whereas Modigraf\u00ae stable required dose was higher: 0.30\u00b10.10 mg/kg/day (p =0.0003). Target levels of tacrolimus were reached after",
