            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a recently emerged pathogen, which belongs to the Arteriviridae family of enveloped, plussense RNA viruses. PRRSV was first isolated in Western Europe, and shortly thereafter in North America (for a recent review see [20] ). Despite the concurrent emergence of PRRSV-induced disease on the two continents, transatlantic PRRSV strains proved surprisingly divergent, with only 55-80% nucleotide homology in the structural genes [12] . In Denmark, the epidemic spread of indigenous, European-type PRRSV was attempted halted in 1996 by a largescale vaccination campaign, using a \"classical\" cell culture-attenuated live vaccine, based on the pathogenic North American VR2332 isolate. Unfortunately, this live vaccine strain proved unexpectedly adept at reverting to virulence and spreading to non-vaccinated herds [4, 10, 17, 21] . On a speculative note, many of the questions arising from the coexistence of European and American PRRSV types in Denmark may impinge on a single viral genetic element: the PRRSV untranslated 5 -leader. For the closely related coronaviruses, the 5 -leader regulates viral genomic RNA replication, transcription and mRNA translation [9, 22, 23] . Furthermore, the 5 -leaders appears to be a highly mobile genetic element, able of high-efficiency recombination between related viruses [11] , and 5 -leaders of other RNA viruses such as poliovirus and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus contain attenuation/virulence determinants [5, 8] . In short, examination of the PRRSV 5 -leader sequence was expected to provide basic knowledge about the molecular basis of PRRSV replication/virulence/attenuation, as well as improve our means for understanding and monitoring any future exchange of genetic material between coexisting PRRSV types.",

We observed that American and European-type-PRRSV were apparently evolutionary sufficiently distant, yet adequately close, for highly conserved motifs to become apparent in the 5 -leader sequences (Fig. 1) . A 12 nucleotide stretch containing a purine (A/G) and a pyrimidine (C/U) wobble position appeared to form a conserved \"5 -leader start\" motif ( Fig. 1, shaded) . Additionally, the 40 most 3 -terminal bases of the leader exhibited a high degree of conservation between European-and American-type PRRSV, and in this conserved area, a string of 8, 9 and 11 wholly invariable nucleotides appeared to be embedded ( Fig.  1 , shaded areas). Whereas these 5 -leader motifs are candidates for mediating the RNA-protein interactions thought important for regulating PRRSV replication, identification of protein partners, if any, will require further studies. Yet, we observed that the 9 nt motif contained a CACCC site, with another CACCC site occurring approximately 100 nt further upstream in American as well as Euro- [7, 18] , but their importance for non-retroviral RNA viruses is not known.",

However, the 5 RACE results for 111/92 showed substantial variability in the first 1-2 nucleotides preceding the conserved 12 nt leader start motif (not shown). Therefore, the significance of a single nucleotide difference between VR2332 and the vaccine in this variable position vis-a-vis attenuation can unfortunately not be decided from our data. The 189/190 nucleotide identity between vaccine and VR2332 5 -leaders may indicate non-involvement of the 5 -leader in attenuation. Alternatively, the very high degree (99.7%, [10] ) of conservation between the vaccine and VR2332 in the structural genes may in turn imply that attenuation conditions were not sufficiently harsh to affect the 5 -leader sequence.",

            "text": "PCR amplification of subgenomic mRNAs: Free 5 -leader has been hypothesized to prime subgenomic viral mRNA transcription [1] . 5 -leader priming of subgenomic viral mRNA transcription is thought to require interaction between a 6 nt long junction sequence found at the 3 -end of the free leader, and partly homologous junction sites upstream of the various open reading frames in the viral genome. Thus, examining the junction sites in subgenomic viral mRNAs is integral to understanding the possible function of the 5 -leader in regulating of viral transcription. To determine 5 -leader-mRNA body junctions, total intracellular RNA from PRRSV-infected cultures was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and the \"Ready-To-Go\" reverse transcription system (Pharmacia, Aller\u00f8d, Denmark). cDNA was PCR-amplified using standard protocols. The forward PCR primers were specific for the extreme 5 -end of the leader sequences determined in this study (Fig. 1) , and reverse PCR primers were situated 50-140 nt downstream of the start codon for each mRNA. Primer sequences are available on request. In virtually all cases, a single, predominant PCR product was observed, confirming previous reports that the PRRSV 5 -leader-mRNA junction mechanism is quite site-specific [16] . A highly notable exception was the ORF 7 (nucleocapsid) mRNA of VR2332, where the PCR band pattern indicated equal utilization of more than one junction site. Similar findings for VR2332 have recently been reported by others (see [20] and references therein). The sequence data are summarized in Table 1 . For all subgenomic mRNAs of 111/92, the junction sequences as well as the length of untranslated sequence between the 5 -leader and the start codon of the downstream open reading frame (Table  1) corresponded to the published values for Lelystad virus [16] . Thus, the 6 nt differences in the 5 -leaders (Fig. 1) , as well as the 7% nucleotide differences in the structural genes [10] , had no influence on the junction-choice of these two European-type viruses. Also, the published lengths of untranslated sequence between the 5 -leader and downstream ORF in mRNAs 3 and 4 of different North American PRRSV isolates [14] , and mRNAs 5, 6 and 7 of a Japanese PRRSV isolate [19] , were the same as the values determined for VR2332 in this study. Thus, for North American PRRSV types, the junction-choice also appears to be well conserved, despite relatively high (up to 11%) nucleotide differences in the structural genes [13, 14] . The VR2332 junctions determined in this study for mRNAs 5, 6 and 7 differed from those determined in another study for a Japanese, American-type PRRSV isolate [19] . However, the VR2332 junctions determined in this study for mRNAs 3 and 4 were identical to those determined previously for different North American isolates [14] . These findings may reflect genetic differences between Japanese and North American PRRSV type [19] . ",

Y in mRNA 6 of 111/92 and K in mRNA 7 of VR2332 indicate C/U and U/G ambiguities, respectively, due to clonal sequence variation in the mRNA population [16] . The genomic site 5 for 111/92 (EMBL accession number AJ223078) and genomic site 2 for VR2332 (GenBank accession number U87392) were re-sequenced for the present study.

Insertions/deletions are indicated by dashes. The bottom line shows completely conserved nucleotides. The 6 nucleotides that differ between 111/92 and Lelystad leaders are shown with underlined, bold lettering in the 111/92 sequence. Longer runs of nucleotides that are highly conserved between European and American PRRSV are shaded. CACCC motifs are boxed. The 6 nt junction sequence at the 3 end of the leader is italicized. The shown junction sequences are derived from the ORF 7 mRNA (111/92), and ORF 2 mRNA (VR2332), which were the subgenomic viral mRNA's targeted by 5 RACE. For Lelystad virus, the genomic junction sequence is shown. See text for details pean leaders (Fig. 1, boxed nucleotides). CACCC motifs have been implicated in regulating Epstein-Barr virus and human T cell leukaemia virus replication through interaction with Sp1 and Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factors",
