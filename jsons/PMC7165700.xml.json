Understanding the factors that enable or facilitate these processes is a crucial step for such events to be predicted. Host shifting, that is the colonization of a new host species by a pathogen, requires a certain level of overlap in species traits (\u201cecological fitting\u201d) in order to overcome barriers of cross\u2010species transmission and for survival and reproduction within novel host species (Agosta, Janz, & Brooks, 2010; Parrish et al., 2008; Woolhouse, Haydon, & Antia, 2005). In the search for mechanisms and enabling conditions that might help to predict the future emergence of infectious diseases from animal populations, the necessity of considering entire host species communities amongst underpinning biogeographical structure and connectivity has recently been emphasized (Clark et al., 2018; Fenton, Streicker, Petchey, & Pedersen, 2015; Poulin, 2010; Wells et al., 2018).",

Other recent \u201cbig data\u201d studies of mammal\u2013virus associations have explored whether host traits and geographical distribution can predict those species that are most likely to harbour undiscovered viruses that might cause future pandemics using trait\u2010based regression analysis (Han, Schmidt, Bowden, & Drake, 2015; Luis et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017).

            "text": "We address this knowledge gap by exploring the role of different mammalian species in the spread of viruses through entire host communities. In particular, we test whether domestic species (livestock and companion animals) play a major role in virus spread and spillover among humans and wildlife. To this end, there are strong reasons why domesticated animals should cover central positions in networks of host\u2013virus associations. Domesticated animals share large numbers of viruses and other parasites with humans (Morand, McIntyre, & Baylis, 2014) and were recently reported to play crucial roles in the sharing of helminth parasites between humans and wildlife (Wells et al., 2018). Moreover, the large numbers of domestic animals compared with the numbers of wildlife (Bar\u2010On, Phillips, & Milo, 2018), and the close contact between them and people, creates ground for frequent and multilateral exposure. For entire networks of viruses and mammalian host associations, we also expect different patterns of virus sharing for the two different genome types of DNA and RNA viruses. Greater rates of replication error and higher genetic diversity in RNA virus populations have been proposed to increase their host range through more frequent host shifting and adaptation to distantly related host species, whereas DNA viruses and retroviruses are assumed to be more host specific owing to stronger co\u2010divergence with their hosts over much longer evolutionary time\u2010scales (Cleaveland, Laurenson, & Taylor, 2001; Geoghegan, Duch\u00eane, & Holmes, 2017; Jackson & Charleston, 2004; Longdon et al., 2018). With the mounting recognition that host use in parasites seems to be more constrained by ecological opportunity than by evolutionary history, there is an urgent need to understand and quantify pathogen spread and host\u2010shifting capacity in response to specific traits at a global scale (Nylin et al., 2018; Wells & Clark, 2019). Nevertheless, to date little comprehensive work has explored whether host sharing and virus spread at the network level differ among these types of viruses and whether they interact with the various groups of mammals in different ways. We used network centrality analysis and Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the extent of virus sharing among different mammalian host species and the proportion of zoonotic viruses carried in different hosts. If domestic species are key drivers of virus spread, we expect them to occupy central positions in networks of pathogen sharing at the human\u2013domestic animal\u2013wildlife interface, whereby variation in the host specificity of viruses might curtail their spread among the diversity of mammalian hosts at the global scale.",

For Shannon indices, larger values are linked to an overall larger number of records and a more even distribution of records among different virus species, that is, higher overall sampling coverage (Magurran, 2004). We generated these multiple indices as proxies of sampling intensity because the true sampling effort is not known. This is because records of species interactions in the literature are arguably \u201cpresence\u2010only\u201d records and rarely report the lack of interactions or the number of host individuals examined that would reduce the number of pseudo\u2010absences in biotic interaction data (Little, 2004; Wells et al., 2013).",

To account for sampling variation that could bias centrality measures (larger sample sizes may increase the relative number of interactions reported for poorly sampled host species; Costenbader & Valente, 2003), we randomly removed subsets of interaction records from the adjacency matrix used for calculating centrality measures. For this, we varied the proportion of removed interactions between 5 and 30% in each of 200 iterations, following a uniform distribution. We used the relative proportion of publication and sequence numbers for each mammal\u2013virus combination as two independent sets of probabilities of which interactions to remove.

It comes as little surprise, therefore, that globally pervasive mammal groups, such as bats and rodents, are often considered to share as many viruses with humans as do primates, our closest relatives (Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, & Schountz, 2006; Luis et al., 2013; Olival et al., 2017). Our study adds new insights into virus spread across mammalian communities. Specifically, we provide the strongest evidence to date that domestic animals are the most central species in mammalian host\u2013virus interaction networks. We also find rather distinctive patterns of how DNA and RNA viruses are shared and spread among different mammalian groups, with bats and carnivores being most influential in spreading RNA viruses and playing only a minor role in spreading DNA viruses through the network. We emphasize the dominant role of domestic species in virus sharing, because domestication status strongly increases the chance of virus sharing among multiple mammalian hosts. Likewise, we also find domestic species to carry larger proportions of zoonotic viruses than wildlife species after accounting for phylogeny and other traits.",

            "text": "Our study concerns the contemporary pattern of virus sharing of mammal species rather than any specific co\u2010evolutionary histories of host switching and origin of viruses. In many, perhaps most instances, this sharing indicates the possibility of cross\u2010species transmission, either directly via contact or indirectly via air, soil, water, fomites or vectors. The exceptionally high virus sharing of humans and domestic animals with other mammalian species suggests that these species play a crucial role in spreading viruses, because frequent virus acquisition and dissemination is the most plausible explanation for such intensive virus sharing. This might reflect the wide geographical distribution and opportunities for contact with wildlife across biogeographical borders, given that domestic species are not particularly distinguished from wildlife in terms of ecological traits. In fact, opportunity for contact and community assembly have been shown in a number of studies to impact pathogen sharing and host shifting (Clark et al., 2018; Cooper, Griffin, Franz, Omotayo, & Nunn, 2012; Wells & Clark, 2019). Many pathogens, including viruses, can overcome species and environmental barriers to infect distantly related hosts and disperse across large geographical areas (Longdon, Brockhurst, Russell, Welch, & Jiggins, 2014; Wells, O'Hara, Morand, Lessard, & Ribas, 2015), although strong constraints in host shifting may also cause biogeographical structure in pathogen diversity and zoonotic disease risk (Murray et al., 2015; Poulin, 2010). Beside the large geographical ranges and diverse habitats encroached by domestic species, their large population sizes and high densities, which often exceed those of wildlife populations (Bar\u2010On et al., 2018), could also contribute to host shifting and pathogen spread. This could be the case especially if large population sizes facilitate the opportunity for contact, virus amplification and diversification caused by more intensive within\u2010population transmission or other factors, warranting future research.",

Here, we reveal, for the first time, that these two major groups of viruses are spread differently across entire networks of mammalian hosts, which is an important finding that remains largely unnoticed when looking solely at the species richness and propensity of zoonotic viruses carried in different wildlife species. Remarkably, Chiroptera and Carnivora hold central positions in terms of virus sharing with other species for RNA viruses only, whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses with other host species. In practice, these findings translate into a minor role of bats and carnivores for the spread of DNA viruses (and relatively low risk that DNA viruses will spillover from these species to humans). We also found that cattle (Bos taurus), pigs (Sus scrofa), horses (Equus caballus) and sheep (Ovis aries), which are globally the most abundant and economically important mammalian livestock species (Thornton, 2010), are among those species with the relatively highest centrality measures in terms of DNA virus sharing. Importantly, it should be noted that for all these species, the frequencies of sharing DNA viruses with other host species was considerably lower than for sharing RNA viruses regardless of centrality measures (as is also true for group\u2010level estimates for different mammalian orders, as depicted in Figure 3). We thus emphasize that the aforementioned species have a relatively crucial role in spreading DNA viruses, whereas RNA viruses generally are much more frequently shared among mammalian host species. In this context, our model framework for analysing patterns in host sharing provides probabilistic estimates of the variation in the pairwise phylogenetic and functional similarities of infected versus uninfected host species as a signal of host specificity. This tool enables us to quantify host specificity of DNA versus RNA viruses in different groups of hosts, resulting in refined and community\u2010wide measures of previously notified higher host specificity in DNA viruses compared with RNA viruses (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Geoghegan et al., 2017; Jackson & Charleston, 2004). Notably, the low functional host specificity of RNA viruses exhibited by viruses shared among hosts of Primates, Carnivora, Artiodactyla and Chiroptera (i.e., functional traits of pairs of host species infected by these viruses were larger than expected by chance) emphasizes their capacity to cross ecological species barriers during host\u2010shifting events despite the overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species.",

Consequently, disentangling host or virus traits as drivers of the differential spread of DNA and RNA viruses among different mammalian orders is currently not possible and requires additional research. Possible working hypotheses as to why primates and ungulates are of relatively high central importance in sharing DNA viruses could be linked to mechanisms that enable efficient within\u2010host virus replication and population\u2010level transmission. At the same time, exploration of virus attributes of the major DNA virus families shared among these host species, namely Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae (Supporting Information Figure S4), might help to explain why these viruses are more likely to be shared by primates and ungulates but are less likely to cross host species barriers with regard to bats and carnivores. Moreover, the strong links of some RNA viruses, such as the Bunyavirales, to arthropod vectors (Marklewitz, Zirkel, Kurth, Drosten, & Junglen, 2015) requires further research into the role of host\u2013vector associations and other transmission modes for the spread of viruses.",

            "text": "We recognize several shortfalls in analysing database records of host\u2013pathogen associations. First, any record of a virus species in a host relies entirely on targeted molecular screening. Certain research foci, such as the boost in coronavirus research linked to bats after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemics (Drexler, Corman, & Drosten, 2014), may include a sampling bias difficult to capture when accounting only for publication or sequencing numbers as proxies for sampling bias, because the true presence/absence of viruses in non\u2010target host species remains unknown. Undoubtedly, major research efforts are linked to viruses of public health relevance, whereas there is a dearth of systematic pathogen surveillance in wildlife (Tompkins, Carver, Jones, Krko\u0161ek, & Skerratt, 2015). Whether different sampling efforts for DNA and RNA are captured sufficiently by the proxies for sampling bias is unknown and warrants future research. Second, detection of a pathogen in any targeted host species depends on its prevalence in its host population and the number of sampled host individuals, but such information is not always available from collated database records. With sparse data, any direct interpretation of absolute numbers of species richness and interactions could instead reflect the observation process rather than true biological patterns and processes (Wells et al., 2013), and we are therefore not able to explore such important properties in our study. Network topologies can be also biased by sampling and data aggregation (Farine & Whitehead, 2015). We control for research effort in our analysis by accounting for variation in relationship to publications and sequencing numbers, as has been done previously (G\u00f3mez et al., 2013; Olival et al., 2017). However, as more complete data from systematic disease surveillance efforts becomes available, it will be desirable to improve such analysis to better distinguish true but undiscovered interactions from \u201cfalse zeros\u201d among other sources of bias. Compiling host\u2013pathogen interactions from the literature and published evidence may also lead to \u201cfalse positives\u201d, such as interactions recorded from laboratory infection studies only; we minimized this error in our study by considering only interactions backed by molecular sequence records with information about sampling location in the metadata. The ongoing sophistication and broad\u2010scale application of molecular screening methods for detecting pathogen species and identifying lineage variation might also lead to the discovery of unexpected and cryptic interactions among previously disconnected groups (Do\u00f1a, Serrano, Mironov, Montesinos\u2010Navarro, & Jovani, 2019). Finally, we are aware that amalgamating species\u2010specific host\u2013pathogen interactions into an N \u00d7 N adjacency matrix, as used for some network statistics, comes at the cost of losing information about pathogen species identity, and thus the overall connectivity of host species can no longer be traced back to particular pathogen species. Overall, network connectivity and modularity are therefore community\u2010level entities, whereas a focus on particular virus species would require more detailed analysis of underlying species\u2010level interaction matrices.",

Ecological factors that determine the opportunity for contact between different host species pave the way for cross\u2010species transmission, host adaptation and subsequent within\u2010host reproduction and transmission, which are then controlled largely by ecophysiological and genetic factors.
