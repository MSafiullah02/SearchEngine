One aspect is that access to emergency care in Otolaryngology (ORL) patients has already changed in the month following the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, and, seemingly, many non-COVID illnesses have been disappearing.",

Even so, it is difficult to believe that some acute diseases, such as massive epistaxis, otitis, or pharyngotonsillitis, could have occurred so rarely or not at all or, alternately, could have been treated at home by patients or their families. Rather, most certainly, primary care physicians, who have been performing telehealth consultations in accordance with the guidelines from the Higher Institute of Health (ISS), have been providing an invaluable service [1]; it is posited that patients who received primary care services this way may have been able to delay or even forego specialist evaluation. This telehealth treatment has not only helped to keep patients at home but has provided other benefits and should be considered in the future.",

The reduction of some diagnoses may be the consequence of national lockdown orders. For example, the 84.6% reduction in the number of nasal bone fractures may be related to the near-absence of motor vehicle accidents reported during this time. In contrast, it is more difficult to explain the reduction of other acute diseases such as sudden hearing loss, whose frequency decreased 83.3%, especially when compared to non-disease conditions, such as cerumen impaction, whose reduction in presentation, interestingly, was slightly more modest at 73.7%.",

Over the past few decades, the workload performed by healthcare personnel in emergency departments has increased, and some have even noted a reduction in morale and job satisfaction, as their responsibilities include intervening in not only true emergencies but also managing many patients with non-acute complaints. One possible exacerbating factor is the length of waitlists to access outpatient care in the Italian National Healthcare System (NHS), as some patients may have to wait for months to see an otolaryngologist. This situation has motivated many to seek care in the emergency department to skip wait times and receive specialty evaluation and treatment without charge.",

At that time, proposed solutions were to increase utilization of outpatient care and to educate patients to seek a preliminary triage consultation with their family physicians; it is possible that the COVID-19 outbreak is pushing our current society in a similar direction.",
