            "text": "Dental disease is a commonly encountered problem in guinea pigs and rabbits. Guinea pig and rabbit teeth are elodont (continuously growing/erupting), aradicular (open rooted), and hypsodont (long-crowned) and contain incisors and cheek teeth (premolars and molars). With insufficient wear, particularly from low-fiber, low-abrasion diets, molar crowns elongate and alter the slope of the occlusal plane, eventually creating sharp points that inhibit closure, often resulting in secondary incisor elongation.1 Malocclusion also results from diets deficient in vitamin C in guinea pigs because it is critical for gingival health and anchoring of teeth. Trauma, infection, and genetics are also implicated. Dental disease can lead to oral ulcerations, infection, abscess formation, and tongue entrapment in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are more sensitive to subtle occlusal changes than rabbits, and even mild disease can lead to anorexia and malnutrition.2 Buccal ulcerations generally form along the upper arcades and lingual ulcerations along the lower arcades in rabbits. Congenital deformities can also result in malocclusion and produce dental disease at several months of age. In rabbits with mandibular prognathism, most commonly seen in dwarf rabbits, misalignment causes overgrowth of unopposed incisors, with upper incisors curving inward and upward toward the roof of the mouth and lower incisors curving outward and upward, sometimes into the upper lip or nose.1, 3, 4\n",

The gut flora is sensitive to any type of environmental change. Frequent causes of dysbiosis include poor diet, hypomotility, stress, toxins, and antibiotic use. Low-fiber, high-carbohydrate diets are the primary risk factor for several reasons: (1) formation of dense masses that prohibit adequate digestion and sterilization by the low pH gastric juice and enzymes; (2) reduced hindgut motility (discussed previously), delaying clearance of luminal bacteria and fermentation byproducts, causing an altered cecal pH and fermentation environment that favors the growth of pathogenic species; and (3) carbohydrate-rich diets that provide a readily available source of luminal glucose for opportunistic organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium spp.12, 21 Systemic illness and stress, also acting to reduce motility, can precipitate dysbiosis. Indiscriminate antibiotic use, particularly with narrow-spectrum agents that selectively target beneficial gram-positive bacteria (penicillins, amoxicillin \u00b1 clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, ampicillin, clindamycin, and lincomycin), creates optimal conditions for overgrowth of pathogenic species. Chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfas, and fluoroquinolones are least likely to damage the microflora, and there is a decreased risk with parenteral versus oral administration.14, 22\n",

Although adults with dysbiosis can develop enterotoxemia, weanlings are most susceptible due to their poorly established flora and high gastric pH. Newborns can also develop toxemia from toxin secreted into the milk of infected mothers.12 Recently, it has been demonstrated that C spiroforme toxin (binary actin-ADP-ribosylating, iota-like toxin) gains access to enterocytes via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor, which is also used by the C difficile transferase and C perfringes iota toxins, causing a secretory diarrhea.23, 24 In acute infections, rabbits develop watery diarrhea, possibly with blood, that soils the perineum and legs. They become anorexic and decline over 2 to 4 days into a moribund state with hypovolemic shock, leading to death. On necropsy, the cecum, the primary reservoir for bacterial growth, is often covered with petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhage that can spread into the appendix and proximal colon. The mucosa can also contain hemorrhage, thick mucus, gas, or pseudomembranes.25\n",

Diagnosis is based on clinical history and clinical signs and can be confirmed with polymerase chain reaction or ELISA-based commercial tests for C difficile toxin. Treatment of dysbiosis/enteritis/enterotoxemia involves aggressive supportive care and correction of hypomotility. Correction of dehydration and nutritional deficiencies are critical, as is providing a warm, safe environment with adequate analgesia. For cases of enteritis caused by bacterial overgrowth, fecal bacterial culture and sensitivity can be helpful to guide antiobiotic therapy with broad-spectrum agents, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours) or enrofloxacin (15 mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours). For enterotoxemia, a dual approach of metronidazole (20 mg/kg every 12 hours) and cholestyramine (2 g/20 mL water every 24 hours by gavage) can be used to treat Clostridium infection and bind its toxin, although C spiroforme has widespread intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance.27, 28 Chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg by mouth every 8 hours) can be used to attempt to suppress Clostridial overgrowth.14, 22 Preventing dysbiosis with a high-fiber diet and reducing stress is key to prevention. Attempts to correct the dysbiosis have anecdotal success, including transfaunation and commercial probiotics containing Lactobacillus spp, although controlled studies to document their utility are lacking.29 Exterotoxemia is best avoided by judicious antibiotic use in guinea pigs and rabbits.",

In more severe or perforated disease there may be clinical signs of anemia and shock. Physical examination may reveal acute abdomen with peritoneal signs. Radiographic imaging or ultrasonography is helpful to eliminate other causes, such as obstruction, neoplasia, or foreign body. Although endoscopy can provide direct visualization of ulcers, many animals are not sufficiently stable for an anesthetized procedure.13 Treatment should be aimed at controlling any underlying diseases, providing hydration and analgesia (discussed previously), mucosal protection with sucralfate, and acid blockade with ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV every 24 hours or 2\u20135 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours).",

Because signs can be nonspecific, it is advisable to perform blood work on all rabbits presenting with nonspecific signs of GI stasis. If liver enzymes are elevated, abdominal ultrasound is recommended. Ultrasound reveals lack of blood flow in the affected liver lobe on color flow Doppler (Fig. 3\n) and is diagnostic for liver lobe torsion. Prompt surgical removal of the affected lobe is advisable if the patient is stable for surgery.65 If an owner declines surgery, supportive care measures alone (fluids, syringe feeding, prokinetic agents, analgesics, and antibiotics, if indicated) are still indicated.
