Immune cells are particularly enriched in vitamin E because their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content puts them at especially high risk for oxidative damage (1, 2). Free\u2010radical damage to immune cell membrane lipids may ultimately impair their ability to respond normally to pathogenic challenge. Available evidence suggests beneficial effects of supplemental vitamin E on immune function and related diseases. Vitamin E is perhaps one of the most studied nutrients in relation to its immunoregulatory effect. Results from animal and human studies indicate that vitamin E deficiency impairs both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immune functions (3, 4), while supplementation with vitamin E above the recommended levels has been shown to enhance immune response and to be associated with increased resistance against several pathogens (5, 6).",

There are eight naturally occurring forms of vitamin E: \u03b1\u2010, \u03b2\u2010, \u03b3\u2010, and \u03b4\u2010tocopherols and \u03b1\u2010, \u03b2\u2010, \u03b3\u2010, and \u03b4\u2010tocotrienols (\nFig. 1\n). Chemically synthesized \u03b1\u2010tocopherol contains eight stereoisomers and is designated all\u2010rac\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopherol (historically and incorrectly called dl\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopherol), while naturally occurring stereoisomer of \u03b1\u2010tocopherol is RRR\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopherol (formerly called d\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopherol). It has been generally accepted that biological activities of different forms of vitamin E correlate with antioxidant activities in the order of \u03b1 > \u03b2 > \u03b3 > \u03b4 (10). However, recent studies (11, 12) suggest that biological effects of vitamin E may not necessarily correlate with antioxidant activities of different forms of vitamin E. Since 1980, one international unit (IU) of vitamin E has been defined as 1 mg of all\u2010rac\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopheryl acetate, 0.67 mg of RRR\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopherol, or 0.74 mg of RRR\u2010\u03b1\u2010tocopheryl acetate. These differences in definitions of units among different forms of \u03b1\u2010tocopherol are based on rat fetal absorption assay and adjustment for the differences in molecular weights of esters of \u03b1\u2010tocopherol (13).",

The average daily intake of vitamin E in US and other western countries is estimated to be around 10 mg. Certain groups of population, such as the elderly, are at greater risk for inadequate dietary intake of vitamin E (16, 17). Ryan et al.

Considering the results from the study by Meydani et al. (18) in which subjects in the upper tertile of serum vitamin E concentration (>48.4 \u00b5mol/l) after supplementation had higher antibody response to hepatitis B as well as higher DTH responses than those in the lower tertile of serum vitamin E (19.9 \u2013 34.7 \u00b5mol/l), the amount of increase in vitamin E levels achieved in the studies by others (20, 21) might not have been adequate to observe a highly significant effect. It is also noteworthy that Lee and Wan (9) observed a significant increase in cell\u2010mediated immune response with a 13.4 \u00b5mol/l increase in plasma vitamin E level, a level of increase comparable to those observed by De Waart et al. (20) and Pallast et al. (21) with 100 mg supplementation. A difference in baseline vitamin E status may explain the varied results observed in these latter studies, as subjects in the study by Lee and Wan (9) had significantly lower plasma vitamin E levels at baseline (14 \u00b5mol/l) compared with those in the studies by De Waart et al. (20) (33 \u00b5mol/l) and Pallast et al. (21) (31 \u00b5mol/l). As shown in \nFig. 3\n, changes in plasma vitamin E levels up to 25 \u00b5mol/l is linearly associated with a change in DTH response. Further increase in plasma vitamin E level, however, does not seem to be associated with an additional improvement in DTH. A 25 \u00b5mol/l increase in plasma vitamin E can be achieved by consuming 200 mg/day of vitamin E.",

Thus, we proposed that the enhancing effect of vitamin E on T\u2010cell\u2010mediated function might be attributed in part to its inhibition of PGE2 production. In a coculture study, Beharka et al. (22) isolated M\u03c6 and T cells from young (6 months) and old (23 months) C57BL mice and preincubated the cells in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/ml of vitamin E or vehicle solution. M\u03c6 and T cells from young or old mice, preincubated with or without vitamin E, were added together in different combinations and stimulated by ConA. The results showed that supplementation of both T cells and M\u03c6 from old mice with vitamin E significantly increased T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20102 production by old T cells compared to those of control culture. When either M\u03c6 or T cell was supplemented with vitamin E, these changes were still present, but the magnitude of the increase was smaller. When vitamin E\u2010supplemented M\u03c6 from old mice were added to cocultures containing T cells from young mice, proliferation, but not IL\u20102 production, was improved. These results indicate that vitamin E improves T\u2010cell function in aged by two mechanisms: (i) by directly affecting T cells, and (ii) indirectly by reducing M\u03c6 and PGE2 production.",

This effect of PGE2 on T\u2010cell function is the consequence of altered early signaling events in T\u2010cell activation (23) and results in altered cytokine profile of T cells. PGE2 has been consistently shown to inhibit Th1 cytokine IL\u20102 and interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3 production as well as IL\u20102 receptor expression (24, 25). On the other hand, depending on the stimulation condition, PGE2 upregulates or has no effect on the production of Th2 cytokines IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010 (26). Thus PGE2, in general, promotes a shift in T\u2010cell cytokine production from Th1 type to Th2 type.",

In a study by Franklin et al. (29), addition of peritoneal M\u03c6 from old rats to splenocytes from young rats significantly inhibited ConA\u2010stimulated splenocyte proliferation; this inhibitory effect was also observed when PGE2 was added. These findings were further confirmed and extended by Beharka et al. (22) who showed that cocultures of M\u03c6 isolated from old mice with T cells from young mice exhibited lower T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20102 production compared to those of young M\u03c6 with young T cell. Exogenous addition of PGE2, at the concentrations produced by old M\u03c6, decreased T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20102 production by young T cells. Addition of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin or antioxidant nutrient vitamin E inhibited PGE2 production and improved T\u2010cell proliferation and IL\u20102 production. The association between PGE2 and age\u2010associated decrease in T\u2010cell\u2010mediated immune response was further supported by in vivo studies (5, 7), which showed that dietary vitamin E supplementation to old mice and human subjects improved their T\u2010cell proliferation, IL\u20102 production, and DTH response. In these studies, improved T\u2010cell\u2010mediated immune response was accompanied by a reduced PGE2 production (\nFig. 2\n).

Released AA is metabolized to unstable intermediate prostanoids by COX, also called PGH2 synthase. COX has bifunctional catalytic properties. It oxygenates and cyclizes AA to form PGG2 via its COX function, and this is followed by the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 via its peroxidase function. PGH2 is then converted to PGE2 by the terminal synthase, PGE2 synthase (PGES). PGE2 synthesis is mainly determined by the availability of the substrate AA and the activity of enzyme COX.

Thus, to test the hypothesis that age\u2010associated increase in PGE2 is due to an increase in COX activity, Hayek et al.

Ceramide is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through multiple signaling pathways (37). LPS can induce intracellular ceramide generation, while ceramide and SMase mimic LPS action in murine M\u03c6 (38). Age\u2010related increase in brain and liver ceramide and neutral SMase levels has been reported 39, 40, 41). In a senescence model of WI\u201038 human diploid fibroblasts, Venable et al.

Thus, we hypothesized that ceramide might mediate the age\u2010associated increase in COX\u20102 expression and thus PGE2 production. This was supported by the work of Claycombe et al. (32), which showed that M\u03c6 from old mice generate significantly more intracellular ceramide than those from young mice within 30 \u2013 60 min of LPS stimulation. Addition of exogenous ceramide to the M\u03c6 from young mice dose\u2010dependently increased PGE2 production and COX activity.

The binding sites for several nuclear transcription factors, such as nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB), nuclear factor interleukin\u20106, and cAMP\u2010responsive element (CRE), have been identified on the promoter region of the COX\u20102 gene 43, 44, 45). Another redox\u2010sensitive transcription factor, activator protein\u20101 (AP\u20101), has also been shown to be involved in COX\u20102\u2010transcriptional regulation by binding to the CRE binding site (46, 47). No significant difference in LPS\u2010stimulated AP\u20101 or CREB activity was found between young and old M\u03c6. However, NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010binding activity, both consensus and COX\u20102 specific, was higher in old M\u03c6 compared to that of young (33). Further studies indicated that the higher NF\u2010\u03baB activation might be due to increased \u0399\u03baB degradation. The link between NF\u2010\u03baB activity and COX\u20102 activation was supported by the observation that COX\u20102 mRNA and protein expression, COX activity, and PGE2 production were reduced when activation was blocked by using either a pharmacological inhibitor of I\u03baB phosphorylation or a specific NF\u2010\u03baB decoy (33). The authors further showed that ceramide stimulates by itself and also potentiates LPS\u2010induced PGE2 production and COX\u20102 expression, and this effect of ceramide was mediated through inducing NF\u2010\u03baB activation (33).

Thus, the vitamin E\u2010induced decrease in COX activity of M\u03c6 from old mice is not due to its regulation of COX transcription or translation; rather, it appears that vitamin E exerts its effect post\u2010translationally (\nFig. 4\n).

It has been suggested that NO stimulates COX activity via direct stimulation of the enzyme (54). LPS\u2010stimulated peritoneal M\u03c6 from old mice were shown to produce more NO than those from young mice (55, 56), while dietary supplementation with vitamin E was shown to reduce NO production in M\u03c6 from old mice (55). NO can be further metabolized to peroxynitrite (ONOO) in the presence of superoxide, and ONOO has been shown to increase the activity of COX without affecting its expression (57). Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased NO and thus ONOO formation may mediate the inhibition of COX activity by vitamin E. This hypothesis was tested in a study conducted by Beharka et al. (55) in which young (6 months) and old (24 months) mice were fed 30 (control) or 500 ppm (supplementation) vitamin E for 30 days. Results from this study confirmed previous findings that M\u03c6 from old mice produced more NO than those from young mice. Furthermore, the age\u2010associated increase of NO was reduced by vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E supplementation did not affect LPS\u2010induced superoxide generation, but reduced the further potentiated superoxide generation in the presence of superoxide\u2010generating agents. Addition of NO donor to cell culture to increase NO levels did not change PGE2 production and COX activity in either young or old mice. However, when NO donor was added in the presence of superoxide to elevate ONOO levels in the culture, vitamin E\u2010induced inhibition in COX activity in the M\u03c6 from old mice was diminished. On the other hand, when NO and superoxide inhibitors were added to M\u03c6 from old mice fed control diet to block generation of ONOO, COX activity was significantly reduced. These results suggest that vitamin E reduces COX activity in old M\u03c6 by decreasing NO production, which leads to lower production of ONOO in M\u03c6 from old mice (\nFig. 4\n).",

Activation\u2010induced cell division of T cells from old mice was lower than that by young, and the production of IL\u20102 following 48\u2010h activation was less by T cells from old mice. The defect in proliferation and IL\u20102 production was specific to na\u00efve T cells and was not observed in memory T cells. Furthermore, there was an age\u2010related decline in both the number of IL\u20102+ T cells and the amount of IL\u20102 produced per cell and an age\u2010related decline in cell division within na\u00efve T\u2010cell subpopulation (\nFig. 5A,B\n).

Most of the animal studies that investigated the effect of vitamin E on infectious diseases reported a protective effect despite the variations in the dose and duration of the supplementation, infectious organisms involved, and route of administration. Vitamin E supplementation in old mice resulted in significantly lower viral titer on 2, 5, and 7 days postinfection and preserved antioxidant nutrient status following influenza virus infection. A significant inverse correlation was observed between hepatic vitamin E levels and lung viral titers (6, 64). Preservation of antioxidant status might protect tissues from oxidative stress caused by the virus itself or by the host's effector mechanisms. Han et al. (65) showed that vitamin E supplementation of old mice infected with influenza significantly increased production of IL\u20102 and IFN\u2010\u03b3. The change in IFN\u2010\u03b3 production significantly correlated with the decrease in viral titer. These results suggest that the enhancement of Th1 response is one of the mechanisms through which vitamin E provides protection against influenza infection in the old mice. Dysregulation of Th1 and Th2 functions are observed with aging. Decreased production of and responsiveness to IL\u20102 as a result of aging have been demonstrated (66). In addition, aged mice were shown to have decreased ability to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 following infection with Legionella pneumophilia or influenza virus (65, 67, 68). These changes in Th1/Th2 balance can contribute to delayed clearance and recovery from influenza infection. Th1 clones are cytolytic in vitro against influenza\u2010infected target cells, and adoptive transfer of a Th1 clone protects against lethal challenge with influenza virus in vivo (69, 70). Whereas, Th2 clones are noncytolytic and failed to promote recovery from lethal infection after adoptive transfer (70). Furthermore, in vivo treatment with IL\u20104 suppressed CTL response and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, and delayed viral clearance (71).",

Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses represent the majority of the documented causes of colds 86, 87, 88). They exacerbate COPD (89) and are known to be associated with lower respiratory infections in the elderly (88, 90, 91). For example, a prospective cohort study of community\u2010based elderly found that rhinoviruses were associated with lower respiratory symptoms in nearly two\u2010thirds of episodes: about one\u2010fifth of patients were confined to bed, and 26% were unable to perform routine household activities (91). Constitutional and lower respiratory tract symptoms and signs have been reported to be more common in the elderly compared to younger adults infected with cold viruses (90). Nursing home populations may also be at risk for epidemic outbreaks of rhinovirus infections (92). The common cold is generally less severe than influenza. However, its much higher incidence and its recognized morbidity in the elderly (88, 90, 91, 92) make it an important public health problem in this age group (93). This is particularly relevant, as at present no clinically useful vaccine or antiviral therapy is available to combat colds.",

Thus, our finding that vitamin E supplementation reduces the common cold by 22% has significant implications for the elderly in reducing the burden of diseases and associated health care costs. Currently, there are 34 million elderly in the US. The observation that vitamin E reduced the risk for acquiring all respiratory infections by 20% will translate into about 7 million fewer elderly acquiring respiratory infection.",

Hemila et al.

Common cold episodes were queried three times per year during a 4\u2010year follow\u2010up period.

The Dutch study differed from that of Meydani et al. (84) in terms of the population and the way that respiratory infections were diagnosed. While our subjects were institutionalized elderly, their incidence of respiratory infection was similar to the community\u2010dwelling Dutch elderly (96). Furthermore, we have previously shown that vitamin E is effective in improving the immune response in community\u2010dwelling elderly (5, 18), and although it did not have sufficient power to demonstrate statistical significance, one of these studies showed a 30% reduction of infection in independently living elderly (18).",

In our study, the presence and type of RI, or absence, was documented by infectious disease specialists based on review of data gathered by trained research nurses during weekly subject interviews, review of medical records, and physical examination focused on respiratory infections using standardized case definitions (76, 90, 97, 98, 99). Furthermore, our results indicate that vitamin E reduces upper respiratory infections, particularly common colds, with no effect on lower respiratory infections or seasonal allergies. Graat et al. (96) did not differentiate between types of infections or between respiratory infection and allergies, and thus might have overlooked any vitamin E effect on upper respiratory infections. In addition, in our study adherence was checked by nursing home medication records and by periodic plasma vitamin E measurements, whereas the Graat et al.

Binding of LPS to its receptor CD14 at M\u03c6 surface triggers the activation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, including IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3/NF\u2010\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), downstream of TRAF\u20106. IKK is a major kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of I\u03baB. Phosphorylated I\u03baB is further ubiquitinated and eventually degraded, leaving the NF\u2010\u03baB dimer free to translocate to nucleus. I\u03baB degradation is increased in murine M\u03c6, which results in an increased translocation of dimer to nucleus. In the nucleus, NF\u2010\u03baB binds to the promoter region of COX\u20102 gene and initiates its transcription. The resulting mRNA of COX\u20102 encodes synthesis of COX\u20102 enzyme. COX\u20102 catalyzes metabolism of AA to PGH2, which is further isomerized to PGE2. The age\u2010associated increase in activation leads to higher expression of COX\u20102, COX\u20102 activity, and PGE2 production. Although only the LPS\u2010induced activation pathway is illustrated here, age\u2010associated upregulation in COX\u20102 expression and transcription process is not stimulus\u2010specific. The higher COX\u20102 expression in old M\u03c6 is shown to be due to higher level of sphingolipid ceramide. LPS\u2010stimulated M\u03c6 produce more ceramide in old than in young mice. Ceramide upregulates COX\u20102 expression through NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Ceramide addition to young M\u03c6 increases COX\u20102\u2010specific NF\u2010\u03baB activation, COX\u20102 expression, and PGE2 production. Ceramide\u2010induced COX\u20102 upregulation is diminished in the presence of NF\u2010\u03baB decoy or I\u03baB inhibitor. The mechanism by which ceramide activates NF\u2010\u03baB degradation can only be speculated at this time (shown as dotted lines) and remains to be determined. Vitamin E inhibits COX activity but has no effect on expression levels of protein and mRNA of either COX\u20101 or COX\u20102.Vitamin E modulates COX activity post\u2010translationally, through its inhibitory effect on the production of peroxynitrite, a molecule shown to enhance COX activity without affecting COX enzyme expression. M\u03c6 from old mice produce more NO than those from young mice. Vitamin E reduces NO production, and thus peroxynitrite synthesis.",
