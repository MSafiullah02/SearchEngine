One feature of HBoV appears to be its ability to establish a latent stage or even chronic infection (Byington et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2014; Schildgen et al., 2013; Windisch et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2014; Manning et al., 2007; Schenk et al., 2011). Therefore, the presented case is of major importance; as for the first time, we describe an HBoV1-associated chronic respiratory infection in detail, provide evidence for clinical improvement following symptomatic treatment, gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of viral persistence and immune evasion of the virus and provide evidence that the chronic infection with HBoV can include flares of active viral replication followed by symptom free latency.",

Human herpesviruses 1\u20138 were also tested by qPCR as previously described (Windisch et al., 2013). In addition, qPCR for quantification of HBoV1 was performed as previously described using the Qiagen QuantiTect Sybr Green Kit (Qiagen) using primers HBoV-Ku1 and HBoV-Ku2 followed by melting curve analyses (Kaur et al., 2014; Kupfer et al., 2006). Mycobacteria were tested by the MYCO-Direct 1.7 assay (Chipron). Routine culturing, including culturing of anaerobic pathogens, was performed by a microbiology laboratory. The laboratory results for viruses were further confirmed by the University Hospital Bonn, where also an immunodeficiency was excluded and normal immune cell counts and antibody titres were confirmed.",

These episomal structures were still present in the second biopsy from January 2015 (Fig. 1b), although the viraemia was cleared and the macroscopic inflammation signs were no longer present at that moment; thus, in January 2015, an objective improvement was clinically measurable, although the virus still persisted in the mucosal biopsies. Surprisingly, the HBoV FISH signals in the biopsy from January had a different shape compared to the first biopsy taken in June 2014. In June 2014, both the head (green) and the tail (red) signals were adjacent to each other but clearly divided, whereas in January 2015, the head and tail signals show an overlay and appear as yellow signals (Fig. 1b). Additionally, in some cases, single red signals occur. The most likely structural explanation for the FISH result is shown in Fig. 1c, which shows a scheme how the red and green FISH signals are localized on the viral genomic DNA in its putative forms (Fig. 1c).",

Here, not only the virus was shed for an unusual long time in the airways as already described by others (Martin et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2015; Byington et al., 2015) but also the otherwise short-lived viraemia lasted here over 5 months. Additionally, FISH staining revealed most likely an episomal DNA structure in the respiratory mucosa, which could display a persisting form of the virus. The DNA occurred in different shapes that may be compatible with the replication stage. In June 2014, both the head signal and the tail signal were adjacent to each other but clearly divided, indicating a relaxed form of the circular DNA, maybe due to active viral replication, whereas in January 2015, the signals show an overlay and appear as yellow signals possibly indicating a supercoiled form that is not actively replicating. Some single red signals were also detected, which presumably represent deletion forms of the viral genome. The FISH results are consistent with the fact that, in January 2015, both the viraemia and the BAL were cleared, while the previous investigations were both tested positive for HBoV1-DNA.",

Although no clinical symptoms could be associated to HBoV detection, further reports of HBoV-DNA detection in the heart tissue exist (Kuethe et al., 2009). In concert with the fact that myocardial infections are frequently observed after common colds in patients that were physically active during their common cold, HBoV could be accused being a further player in this clinical scenario. Consequently, as the leaky gut syndrome could not be deduced to other factors such as diet, inherited diseases or simultaneous infections, further studies should investigate on the role of HBoV in this syndrome because it could also be linked to the HBoV infection as HBoV is widely detected in feces (Albuquerque et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Campe et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008; Szomor et al., 2009).",

Also in the present case, an increased expression of RANTES and IL-10 besides IL-3, IL-8 and IL-16 was observed in the acute replication period. In contrast, the comparison of sera and BALs reveals a delayed tissue specific increase of Leptin, EGF, VEGF, TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2, which are directly or indirectly involved in fibrosing processes. Moreover, the HBoV-specific cytokine profile in the BAL is characterized by an imbalanced TARC/IP-10 ratio leading to the hypothesis that HBoV influences the Th1/Th2 response within the lung. Furthermore, an imbalanced TARC/IP-10 ratio seems to be associated with fibrotic lung diseases and it is worth to mention that the neutralization of TARC leads to a reduction of fibrosis in the animal (Keane, 2008; Belperio et al., 2004).
