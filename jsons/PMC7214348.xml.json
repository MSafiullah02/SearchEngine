            "text": "An outbreak of an acute respiratory illness of unknown cause started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on December 12, 2019.1\n,\n2 A new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in these patients. Subsequently, the identified acute respiratory illness was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Soon thereafter, the COVID-19 epidemic in China became a pandemic with a significant burden on healthcare and the world-wide economy. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be a distinct class of the beta coronaviruses (Beta-CoVs) with a 79.5% gene sequence homology to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),3 and the 50% homology to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)4. Moreover, the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to RaTG13, a short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region from a bat coronavirus.3 The amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains of Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) used to classify coronavirus species are 94.4% identical between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.1 Coronaviruses, which include non-segmented enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses from the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales, are widely distributed in mammals, including humans. Although most cases of coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV affected more than 10,000 people in the past two decades with mortality rates of 9.6% and 34%, respectively.5\n,\n6 The mortality rate of COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 4.3%7 and as of April 28, 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide have been 2,883,603 and 198,842, respectively.8 SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted between humans via exposure of mucosae or conjunctiva to infected respiratory droplets or contact routes such as fomites in the immediate environment around an infected person.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in tears, similar to SARS-CoV.14 Fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, anosmia, and hypogeusia are the main symptoms of COVID-19. Anorexia, myalgia, dyspnea, chest tightness, sputum production, hemoptysis, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal/back pain are less common signs and symptoms.15\n",

Nevertheless, its effect is not restricted to these cells, and the nervous system can also be involved. Remarkably, SARS-CoV infection has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).16 Encephalitis, seizures, refractory status epilepticus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), leukoencephalopathy, myopathy, and critical illness neuromyopathy have been observed among COVID-19 patients.17 Helms et al.18 reported neurologic signs in about 84% of the patients with COVID-19. Headache, dizziness, and altered level of consciousness were also seen in 11%, 8%, and 9% of the patients with COVID-19, respectively.15 A less common neurological symptom is characterized by acute confusion.4 A GBS-like phenotype has also been noted in patients with COVID-19.19\n,\n20 Impaired taste and smell have been found to be strong predictors of COVID-19. In one study, among 59 patients with COVID-19, 20 (33.9%) had at least one taste or olfactory disorder and 11 (18.6%) had both.21 In another study, loss of smell and taste was found in 59% of 1702 patients with COVID-19.22 However, no post-viral neurological complications have yet been reported.",

VTE was associated with death and its cumulative incidence was higher in the ICU than in other locations.33 In three Dutch hospitals, 184 ICU patients with COVID-19 were studied.34 Despite standard thromboprophylaxis measures, VTE was found in 27%, and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7%, and pulmonary embolism was the most common thrombotic complication among patients.34 At the Tongi hospital in Wuhan, 449 patients with severe COVID-19 were studied.35 Heparin (mainly low molecular weight) for 7 days or longer was administered to 99 patients. There was a positive correlation between D-dimer level, prothrombin time (PT), and age. However, platelet count and 28-day mortality were negatively correlated. Moreover, there was no difference in the 28-day mortality rate among heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910). Nonetheless, the 28-day mortality rate of heparin users was lower than that of nonusers in patients with D-dimer levels > 6 fold of the upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017) or with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score \u2265 4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029). Furthermore, COVID-19 patients can develop a more severe coagulopathy defined as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) that is induced by the acute systemic inflammatory response presumably mediated by the infectious agent or its products. CAC is characterized by an elevation of several blood coagulation markers (e.g., D-dimer, fibrin or fibrinogen degradation product, and fibrinogen), a concomitant rise of peripheral inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, CRP) and a mild thrombocytopenia. The degree of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) elevation is often less than PT, mainly due to increased factor VIII level concentrations secondary to the concomitant inflammatory status. Finally, some severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a coagulopathy similar to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) defined according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria,36 or a fulminant coagulation activation and coagulation factors\u2019 consumption. This coagulopathy is characterized by moderate to severe thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 50 \u00d7 109/L, PT and aPTT prolongation together with a considerable rise of D-dimer levels, and low fibrinogen levels (< 1.0 g/L).7\n,\n12\n,\n37\n,\n38\n",

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, Type I interferon (IFN), which exerts an influence upon innate and acquired immunity, and most importantly against viral infections, is released.27 Nevertheless, IFN release can give rise to inflammation and immune system suppression.43 A significant difference in IL-6 concentrations between COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors has been observed, where non-survivors had up to 1.7-times higher levelss of IL-6. Moreover, a cytokine profile similar to that of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hyperinflammatory syndrome) is associated with the severity of COVID-19.12 This cytokine storm is explained by IL-2, IL-7, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1.12 Therefore, blocking inflammation and IL-6 is the rationale for ongoing clinical trials that are examining the use of IL-6 receptor blocker such as Tocilizumab (clinicaltrials.gov trials NCT04317092, NCT04320615, and NCT04335071) where elevated IL-6 level is strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation.44\n",

Therefore, it is likely that also in instances of COVID-19 infection, the systemic inflammatory response in the host rather than the viral invasion per se could be responsible for an elevated stroke risk. However, at present all studies on COVID-19 related stroke are observational and retrospective. Studies evaluating the stroke risk after COVID-19 have not been performed thus far. Furthermore, study results may be biased by low numbers, absence of appropriate control subjects with recent infection, and multiple selection biases, so the data is inconclusive. There is preliminary evidence for an association between COVID-19 and stroke, but causality has not been established. The preliminary observed association could be explained by residual confounding, incomplete ascertainment, and insufficiently controlled studies. Before assuming causality (Koch postulates) a specific link between SARS-Cov-2 and stroke should be fully established. Thus at the moment no changes in the routine stroke care should be implemented as an adjunct to antiplatelets/antithrombotics and statin therapies that are already practiced in clinical settings.",

Coronaviruses are neurotropic in several of their hosts, including humans.16 The blood-brain barrier (BBB), the anatomical gateway essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and physiological environment of the central nervous system (CNS), serves an important role in the protection against pathogens. Endothelial cells of the capillaries, pericytes, and astrocyte end-feet constitute the BBB. Inflammation and vascular damage can increase BBB permeability and potentiates unwanted CNS effects.16 Viruses can cross the BBB through several ways including transcellular, paracellular, and retrograde axonal transport along sensory and olfactory nerves.55 Viremia is the viral mechanism for migration. Viral transcellular migration occurs when the virus invades the host cells or macrophages to overcome the BBB. Paracellular migration occurs when the virus attacks the tight junctions in BBB.55 Axonal transport is provided via adherence of the virus to proteins of peripheral or cranial nerves, which allows retrograde neuronal transport.56\n",

It has been shown that ACE2 activation inhibited thrombus formation and platelet adhesion to the vessel walls among spontaneously hypertensive rats.80 Infusion of Ang-(1-7) (1, 10, or 100 pmol/kg/min for 2 hours) in rats with venous thrombosis resulted in a 50-70% decrease in the amount of thrombus.81 This was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by co-treatment with a selective Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist (A-779) or AT1R antagonist (EXP 3174) but not by AT2R antagonist (PD 123,319). Additionally, the antithrombotic effect of captopril (an ACE inhibitor) and losartan (an AT1R blocker) were dose-dependently weakened by administering A-779. Concomitant treatment of N\nG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NO synthase inhibitor) and indomethacin (prostacyclin synthesis inhibitor) annulled the effect of Ang-(1-7).81 In Mas+/+ mice, Ang-(1-7) was seen to inhibit thrombus formation, which was annulled in Mas-knockout mice; NO release stimulated by Ang-(1\u20137) was blocked in platelets of Mas-knockout mice; and Mas deficiency significantly decreased bleeding time.82\n",

Stroke presentations (as well as other acute emergencies) to EDs have declined, with some areas reporting a significant decline.109 The reasons for these observations are not fully clear, as yet. Some have speculated a decline in incidence, perhaps related a decrease of other respiratory infections. This may be attributed to improved hand-washing frequency and social distancing practices, which would also limit the spread of other infections linked to strokes. Another plausible explanation may reflect patients\u2019 reluctance to come to EDs (particularly with mild non-disabling strokes) due to fear of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the perception that EDs are crowded and overwhelmed that cannot provide proper care. In this regard, it is of the utmost importance to educate patients and the public at large, that this is not the case, as EDs have taken precautions to ensure patients and caregivers are protected and hospitals remain the best place to receive timely and appropriate care for time-sensitive acute emergencies such as acute ischemic strokes. Hospital administrations should also ensure patients safety through appropriate preventive measures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Many important aspects of patient evaluation and care can be performed via telemedicine. Early supported discharge services should be organized for patients suffering from acute strokes with or without confirmed COVID-19.",

CAC, a crucial condition of this disease, is likely caused by inflammation, including an inflammatory cytokine storm. Recent studies have also suggested axonal transport of SARS-CoV-2 via the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb to the brain. The process of internalization of SARS-CoV2 occurs when S glycoprotein of the virus binds to ACE2 on cellular membranes. ACE2 is expressed in several tissues and organs, including the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. SARS-CoV-2 induces downregulation of ACE2. This can over-activate the classical RAS axis, as well as under-activate the alternative RAS signaling in the brain. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombogenesis can contribute to stroke pathophysiology during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anecdotal observations highlight the challenges of treating COVID-19 patients who have strokes that further complicate the care for these severely ill patients. Although the lungs are ground zero in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 can also effect other organs such as the brain, heart, vascular system, and kidneys.106 Unlike our earlier understanding that COVID-19 was similar to a \u201cregular flu\u201d, we now know that SARS-CoV-2 acts like no other pathogen scientists and clinicians have previously experienced, as it can attack several organs, causing significant and permanent damage. Standing orders and protocols should be modified to provide better individualized care for stroke patients vis-\u00e0-vis COVID-19.",
