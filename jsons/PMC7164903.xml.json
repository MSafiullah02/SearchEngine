Given the economics of the healthcare system in the United States, large metropolitan cities frequently have separate hub and spoke systems that overlap geographically with each other to a significant extent. It is a real possibility that one or more of these hub an d spoke systems may become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, thus it is important for hospital leadership to re-examine existing relationships to allow for smooth reallocation of  resources, mobilizing workforce, optimizing new beds availability, and rapidly liberating ICU beds.",

Patients with low suspicion for stroke, or mild symptoms with no potential indication for acute intervention may be evaluated via telemedicine (when possible) to aid in determination if immediate hospitalization is necessary. Given the degree of community spread of COVID-19, along with cases of asymptomatic transmission, all patient with acute stroke symptoms should be treated as suspected or possible COVID-19 patients (frequently termed person under investigation, PUI), and all personnel physically in contact should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Of note, several centers in Chicago have seen a decline in stroke admissions and EMS calls for stroke are down by twenty percent. If this is a result of social distancing practices reducing the frequency of which patients with stroke are found, or from fear on behalf of patients of contracting COVID-19 by seeking out care is unclear.",

Patients receiving intravenous chemical thrombolysis should be monitored per current stroke guidelines; however, to avoid exposure of personnel, monitoring could be performed virtually with two-way video conferencing in some cases. In the event that resources are so strained that standard protocol cannot be effectively adhered to, a difficult decision would have to be made to either with-hold thrombolysis, or utilize an abbreviated protocol for post thrombolysis monitoring (11). As mentioned by a recent AHA position paper, treatment for eligible patients should continue to be offered, even if every vital sign assessment cannot occur at the prescribed time interval (12). Current practices involve institutions admitting post thrombolysis patient to intensive care units (ICU); to avoid utilization of ICU beds, stroke patients post thrombolysis may be admitted to intermediate care unit (IMCU) or stroke \u2018step down\u2019 units, supervised by neurologists or vascular neurologists presuming there is a low probability of intensive care unit needs (12, 13) along with early acceptance of patients with small, stable intracerebral hemorrhages and those with subarachnoid hemorrhage at low risk for vasospasm as suggested by Chartrain and colleagues (14).",

The Seattle-based Life Care Center of Kirkland nursing home in Kirkland, Washington was considered \u201cground zero\u201d in the COVID-19 pandemic by the CDC director. Case work managers and discharge planners will continue to work with admission teams at the inpatient rehabilitation centers to expedite discharges. Ideally there would be no change in post hospitalization placement in acute and subacute rehabilitation facilities; realistically, however, hospitals may need to designate rehabilitation beds for patients who do not qualify for transfer to acute inpatient facilities, as well as discuss discharging patients home when medically stable and appropriate until the pandemic is under control if there is no practical placement option.",
