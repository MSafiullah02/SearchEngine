            "text": "Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide [1]. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild-form nonspecific febrile illness, such as cough, sore throat, headache, rhinorrhea, malaise, and muscle ache, to respiratory failure and death [2]-[4]. Its symptoms and signs can be similar to other viral illnesses such as dengue, making the infections difficult to distinguish. The clinical manifestations of dengue illness vary greatly, ranging from a mild, flu-like, and self-limited febrile illness to severe dengue [5],[6]. Influenza and dengue overlap geographically in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [1],[7]. Concurrent influenza and dengue outbreaks have been reported [8]-[11]. The overlapping clinical features of influenza and dengue created clinical diagnosis and management challenges during simultaneous influenza and dengue outbreaks in Puerto Rico in 1977 [11]. Dengue epidemics have occurred in Taiwan for decades [12],[13]. An outbreak of 2009 pandemic H1N1 occurred in Taiwan after the first case was identified on May 20, 2009 [14]. The overlapping symptoms and signs of influenza and dengue created a confusing clinical situation and challenges in etiology identification. Although rapid diagnostic tests can help confirm an influenza diagnosis, their sensitivity ranges from 40-70% depending on the day of illness and specimen type [15]. Definitive diagnosis of dengue is made using serology tests, but these tests are not always readily available in most clinical laboratories [7],[16]. Our study aimed to identify clinical and laboratory features that distinguish influenza from dengue and other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue and non-dengue endemic settings. We applied decision tree analysis to our dataset to discriminate patients with influenza from those with dengue. Our findings may be valuable for clinicians working in crowded emergency rooms (ER) in countries with limited medical resources.",

To distinguish influenza from dengue or OFI in a dengue and non-dengue endemic settings, univariate analyses were performed to compare clinical and laboratory characteristics between (i) influenza and dengue, and (ii) influenza and OFI. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher exact tests, and continuous variables were compared using Student's t or Mann-Whitney U tests. A 2-tailed P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Significant variables in the univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine independent predictor(s) of (i) influenza versus dengue, and (ii) influenza versus OFI. The sensitivity and specificity of each significant variable was assessed. Classification and regression tree analysis was performed [24]. The variables found to be significant in multivariate logistic regression with sensitivity greater than 80% were used to establish diagnostic decision trees to distinguish between patients with influenza and those with dengue [24]. Diagnosis was achieved by stepwise binary splitting, where one variable was entered at each node and, depending on the answer, a branch of the tree containing another variable was followed. Splitting stopped at nodes with a minimum classification of dengue, maximum classification of influenza, or a small number of patients in the node. For each terminal node, patients were classified as having low or high probability for influenza infection. To investigate the impact of age on the clinical presentation of influenza, dengue, and OFI, stratified analyses were performed for pediatric (\u226418 years) and adult (>18 years) patients to examine the differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics between (i) influenza and dengue, and (ii) influenza and OFI.",

            "text": "The symptoms of influenza overlap substantially with dengue and OFI (Table 2). We found that symptoms resulting from respiratory tract infections such as cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and dyspnea were more prevalent in patients with influenza than with dengue. In contrast, non-respiratory tract symptoms including rashes, headache, abdominal pain, joint pain, and orbital pain were less common in the patients with influenza compared to patients with dengue. The influenza virus primarily infects epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and causes upper respiratory symptoms [25]. Damage to infected cells results in release of inflammatory mediators, leading to a systemic response (i.e., fever, headache, joint pain, malaise, and myalgia) with symptoms similar to other viral illnesses such as dengue [26],[27].",

            "text": "The overlapping geographic range of influenza and dengue as well as simultaneous dengue and influenza outbreaks [8]-[11], often in resource-limited countries, leads to diagnostic difficulties, as nonspecific symptoms are common to both infections. Early detection of influenza and dengue is especially important because influenza may be prevented through proper isolation and treated using antiviral agents [28],[29], whereas failure to make a timely dengue diagnosis with adequate fluid replacement can lead to severe dengue [30]. Our study demonstrated that the presence of leukopenia (white cell count <3.0 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and marked thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 \u00d7 109 cells/L) are useful for differentiating dengue from influenza in both adults and pediatric patients. The absence of rash further discriminated influenza from dengue in pediatric patients. Rash associated with influenza is not a common manifestation, occurring in only 2-8% of patients, usually children [31],[32]. In contrast, the reported frequency of rash in dengue cases ranges from 46-68%, particularly in children less than 15 years who usually have a nonspecific febrile syndrome accompanied by rash [33],[34]. Mild leukopenia and relative lymphopenia are typical findings of influenza; thrombocytopenia may be present in complicated cases [4],[14],[25]. Notably, our study and others found leukopenia and thrombocytopenia to be common laboratory findings in dengue infection, with platelet counts below 20 \u00d7 109 per liter often observed in severe dengue [7],[30]. A study examining predictors of diagnosis in 1,962 febrile travelers returning from the tropics found the main predictors of dengue infection compared with other fevers, excluding malaria, to include skin rash, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia [35]. This finding was consistent with our study findings.",

However, it is unlikely that any single indicator will be useful in clinical practice because these symptoms and laboratory findings can be present in both infections [11]. In our series, we developed two simple and practical diagnostic algorithms using clinical and laboratory indicators to distinguish influenza from dengue in adult and pediatric patients, respectively. We found that the diagnostic algorithm correctly classified 94.2% of pediatric patients with influenza in the \"high probability\" group with only one misclassified dengue patient (Figure 1). Analysis of our data after excluding pediatric patients showed similar results, except that skin rash that was no longer associated with influenza infection in adult patients; however, the diagnostic tree (Figure 2) still correctly classified 87.8% of adult influenza cases as \"high probability\". These findings underscored that rash, leukopenia, and marked thrombocytopenia could help to establish a diagnostic algorithm to distinguish influenza from dengue patients during outbreaks of both diseases. Additional prospective studies are needed to validate this predictive model in other dengue-endemic regions and in populations with different ethnicities.",

A crowded ER can make it challenging for physicians to differentiate between influenza and OFI [36]. Early antiviral treatment (\u226448 h) of influenza is especially important for patients with underlying risk factors to avoid otherwise preventable morbidity and mortality [37]. Our results demonstrate that rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat, and dyspnea in addition to a slightly low platelet count (100-149 \u00d7 109 cells/L) in children, as well as rhinorrhea and malaise in adults were valuable predictors during the evaluation of the likelihood of influenza versus OFI in a non-dengue endemic setting. However, apart from rhinorrhea, which lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity, we found that all other variables were specific (>70%) but not sensitive enough in distinguishing influenza from OFI. This is not surprising as more than 60% of OFI cases included in this series were individuals with pharyngitis or bronchitis (Table 4), another viral infection commonly encountered in the ER [38]. The information of this study are most helpful for clinicians to facilitate diagnosis of influenza during periods of high influenza activity in non-dengue endemic setting.",
