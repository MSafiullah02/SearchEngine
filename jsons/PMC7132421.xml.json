The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that causes zoonotic human infections also emerged from this region in the late 1990s and has spread to a number of countries in Eurasia and Africa and evolved into different lineages. Long-term surveillance has been established in this region for decades, and the results have provided information on the evolution of animal influenza viruses and mechanisms leading to interspecies transmission events (Sorbello et al., 2012, von Itzstein et al., 1993).

The use of vaccines for the control of influenza requires timely vaccine production (which takes more than 6 months) and knowledge of the antigenic properties of the new circulating strains. This has been a challenging task for annual seasonal influenza vaccine production, as suboptimally matched vaccine strains or delays in production could lower the benefit of vaccination. Furthermore, vaccination may not achieve full protection in certain age groups or patients, as the effectiveness of a vaccine depends on the immune competence of its recipients (Fiore et al., 2009).",

The major challenges of using antiviral compounds for the control of influenza is the development of drug resistance and the difficulties in treating patients with severe influenza (Hayden, 2009). Resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, and viruses with decreased sensitivity to both classes of antivirals have been reported. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop alternative influenza treatments. Novel antiviral compounds are under development. Strategies include improving currently available drugs in design, route of delivery, or potency; identifying new classes of compounds that target different viral proteins; and the application of combination therapy.",

One under-appreciated therapy is traditional Chinese medical herbs. With a 3000-year history, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has its own unique system in diagnosis and therapy. Unlike modern medicine which focuses on specific targets, TCM emphasizes body homeostasis (Yin-Yang Theory). For example, Kakkon-to, a TCM prescription for treating colds and influenza, has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. Treatment of influenza virus-infected mice with Kakkon-to significantly reduced weight loss in the infected animals (Kurokawa et al., 2002). Instead of investigating the effect of TCM crude extracts in influenza treatment, future research should focus on identifying effective compounds isolated from TCM and developing a scientific and systemic platform to categorize TCMs.",

At the same time, the viruses have evolved to hijack cellular mechanisms for their own efficient replication (Nguyen et al., 2010, Webster et al., 1992). Severe influenza, leading to tissue damage, results both from viral replication and host immune responses. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus\u2013host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new regimens of influenza therapy (Ludwig, 2011). Specifically blocking certain signaling pathways has led to reductions in viral titers as well as modulation of host responses to infection, and some immune modulators can be applied in combination with antiviral compounds to both dampen tissue damage and effectively control infection. In this review, we will discuss current and novel concepts of antiviral approaches against influenza, from the point of view of targeting the virus and the host.",

The entry of influenza viruses has been shown to occur via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis (de Vries et al., 2011). The HA is an important host range determinant, as influenza viruses from different hosts show different preferred recognition patterns for sialyl receptors (Rogers and Paulson, 1983). The acidic environment within the endosome following virus entry triggers a conformational change of HA, exposing the fusion protein to mediate the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosome membrane (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). M2 ion channels permit proton flow from the endosome into the interior of the virion, disrupting protein\u2013protein interactions and freeing the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) from the M1 proteins. The M2 ion channel also regulates the pH of the trans-Golgi network to prevent premature conformational changes of HA at later stages in the replication cycle (Lamb and Pinto, 2006).",

Single-amino-acid substitutions at multiple positions (residues 26, 27, 30, 31, or 34) within the trans-membrane domain of the M2 protein confer cross-resistance to amantadine and rimantadine (Gubareva and Hayden, 2006). Treatment of influenza virus infection with M2 ion-channel blockers can cause the emergence of fully pathogenic and transmissible resistant variants in 30\u201380% of individuals, depending on the detection method used (Gubareva and Hayden, 2006). V27A, L26F, and S31N mutations have been reported from surveillance results as transmissible variants (Wang et al., 2011), with S31N as the most prevalent mutation. The current use of adamantine for the treatment of influenza A infection has been limited for H3N2 viruses, since the resistant variant became dominant in 2005 (Deyde et al., 2007). Furthermore, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses that evolved into different clades have exhibited variable degrees of sensitivity to amantadine (Gutierrez et al., 2009). In addition, the newly emerged A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were also resistant to adamatanes, due to the presence of the S31N mutation (Gubareva et al., 2010).",

Derivatives of the spirene guanidine analog, 2-[3-azaspiro(5,5) undecanol]-2-imidazoline (BL-1743) (Kurtz et al., 1995) have also been identified which have a stronger M2 ion channel-inhibiting effect than amantadine (Wang et al., 2009). Furthermore, spirene derivatives [spiro(5,5)undecan-3-amine] inhibit the L26F and V27A variants, which otherwise confer resistance (Balannik et al., 2009). Recent studies on the transmembrane domain of the M2 tetramer complexed with amantadine or rimantadine have revealed two potential inhibitor binding sites, a high-affinity binding site at the N\u2032-terminal channel lumen, in proximity to the reported mutations, that confers resistance to the adamantanes, and a low-affinity binding site at the C\u2032-terminal protein surface (Cady et al., 2010). As amantadine was not structurally designed to fit the M2 ion channel, future optimization of M2 ion channel blockers, based on recent structural information, may provide new possibilities for pharmaceutical investigation (Cady et al., 2010).",

Although the HA and NA surface glycoproteins are subject to humoral immune selection pressure, resulting in antigenic drift, the presence of conserved residues within the NA active site across all influenza subtypes has provided a desirable target for drug design (von Itzstein et al., 1993). Zanamivir (Relenza; 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en, GG167) was the first small molecule against influenza developed through structure-based drug design (von Itzstein et al., 1993). It is administered via inhalation. Further antiviral development resulted in the orally administered compound, oseltamivir phosphate [Tamiflu; ethyl(3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate, GS4104], which is converted into its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate [(3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, GS4071] by hepatic esterases (Kim et al., 1996) (Ward et al., 2005) and the intravenously administered compound, peramivir [(1S,2S,3S,4R)-3-(1S)-1-acetylamino-2- hydroxycyclopentane carboxylic acid, BCX-1812, RWJ-270201] (Babu et al., 2000). Zanamivir and oseltamivir have been approved for the prophylaxis and therapy of influenza A and B since 1999 in the USA and subsequently in other countries, while peramivir is currently under phase III clinical trial in the USA, and is only available in Korea and Japan. NA inhibitors are currently the predominant antiviral drugs used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is more frequently used than zanamivir clinically, due to its oral route of administration. It has also been approved for use in a wider age group, including children 1\u20136 years old.",

Specifically, different NA subtypes of influenza A virus can be grouped based on phylogenetic analysis. Group 1 contains N1, N4, N5, and N8, and group 2 contains the N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9 subtypes. Compared to Group 2 NAs, Group 1 NAs possess an extended cavity (the 150-cavity) due to the differences in amino acid residues within the 150-loop (residues 147\u2013152) (Russell et al., 2006). The extended cavity has provided new insights for NA inhibitor design (Rudrawar et al., 2010). Interestingly, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been reported to lack the 150-cavity (Li et al., 2010).",

Among the NA mutations that confer resistance to NA inhibitors, the H275Y NA mutation (N1 numbering) has been the most extensively studied to date, due to its significance in the seasonal H1N1, highly pathogenic H5N1, or more recently in the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. This mutation was first reported during clinical trials among patients receiving oseltamivir (Gubareva et al., 2001). It was generally detected at a low frequency among community isolates prior to the 2007\u20138 influenza season (Moscona et al., 2010, Sheu et al., 2011). However, an increasing number of H1N1 seasonal influenza viruses encoding the H275Y mutation (N1 numbering) emerged in northern Europe in late 2007 and subsequently spread globally, resulting in dominance of the H275Y variant over the wild-type virus in 2008 (Dharan et al., 2009, Lamb and Pinto, 2006). The detailed mechanism that enables the transmission of the H275Y variant is still under research (Bloom et al., 2010, Resa-Infante et al., 2011).",

However, dual resistance to both oseltamivir and M2-ion channel blockers were detected at an increasing rate among H1N1 seasonal influenza viruses isolate between 2008\u201310, with a 28% (7/25) detection rate reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2009\u201310 season, before seasonal H1N1 was replaced by the newly emerged A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Cheng et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2007). Interestingly, most dual-resistant strains emerged through genetic reassortment, acquiring the M gene from a clade 2C virus with a S31N mutation that confers resistance to amantadine into a clade 2B viruses that already carried the H275Y NA mutation (Sheu et al., 2011).",

Dual-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that acquired NA mutations conferring resistance to NA inhibitors have been identified at <2% of the isolates tested for susceptibility (Hurt et al., 2012).

Recent studies that characterized the fitness and transmission potential of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses carrying the H275Y NA mutation showed variable findings, with most transmission studies in animals supporting a comparable or slightly delayed transmission potential for the H275Y variant (Duan et al., 2010, Kiso et al., 2010, Monto et al., 2006, Sheu et al., 2008, Wunderlich et al., 2009).",

It is processed by cellular adenosine kinase into ribavirin monophosphate (RMP), followed by subsequent phosphorylation into di- or triphosphate (RTP) forms (Graci and Cameron, 2006). Its major antiviral activity is conferred by the RMP form, which is structurally similar to cellular inosine monophosphate (IMP). RMP and IMP therefore can compete for the IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) active site, leading to depletion of the cellular GTP pool (Table 1). Such depletion has a general effect on viral and host RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis, and is considered to be the cause of ribavirin\u2019s broad antiviral activity against different RNA and DNA viruses (De Clercq, 2009, Graci and Cameron, 2006).",

For influenza viruses, RTP has been shown to interact with the RNA polymerase in a cell-free system and exhibit competitive inhibition with GTP and ATP, but not with UTP or CTP (Eriksson et al., 1977). However, a higher concentration of RTP is required to fully inhibit influenza virus RNA elongation than that in competition with the GTP or ATP, suggesting that RTP can be incorporated into the influenza viral genome (Parker, 2005). This mechanism may increase error-prone replication, leading to error-catastrophe and a reduction in yield of infectious virus (Vignuzzi et al., 2005).",

Variable results have been reported from trials using oral or aerosolized ribavirin for influenza A or B patients (Chan-Tack et al., 2009) or from patients receiving intravenous ribavirin under an EIND scheme (Riner et al., 2009). Ribavirin is available as an oral form for influenza treatment in Mexico (Eichelberger et al., 2008) (Table 1). Combination therapy using ribavirin and pegylated interferon-alpha was established in early 2000 and it has become the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (De Clercq, 2009). Treatment for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection using aerosolized ribavirin was approved in 1985, although its clinical benefit is still debatable (De Clercq, 2009). For influenza, ribavirin monotherapy has been tested in clinical trials or under EIND for severe infections. The results of these studies are inconclusive, due to small sample size or differences in treatment dose and duration; the potential clinical benefit of ribavirin for the treatment of influenza infection therefore remains to be further clarified (Chan-Tack et al., 2009). Importantly, resistance to ribavirin has not been reported for HCV, RSV or influenza viruses.",

Its action is mediated via its processed forms, T-705 ribofuranosyl phosphates, which include the monophosphate and triphosphate forms. The triphosphate form is mis-recognized by the influenza virus polymerase as a purine nucleotide during RNA elongation, inhibiting polymerase activity (Furuta et al., 2005). Unlike ribavirin, the host enzyme can differentiate favipiravir and its phosphorylated form from the natural nucleotides; favipiravir therefore shows little inhibitory effect on host cells and less cytotoxity than ribavirin (Furuta et al., 2009). The antiviral activity of T-705 can vary, depending on the host cells used; differences in uptake efficiency and/or the effectiveness of conversion of favipiravir into its ribofuranosyl phosphates by host-cell enzymes may determine its antiviral activity (Furuta et al., 2009). Synergistic effects between oseltamivir and favipiravir have been reported in mice against H1N1, H3N2 or H5N1 influenza virus infections (Smee et al., 2010).",

Limited resistance to favipiravir has been reported; no resistant variant was detected after 30 serial passages of the A/PR/8/34 influenza virus (Furuta et al., 2009).

The inhibitory effect was associated with the inhibition of NP transportation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Kao et al., 2010). Resolution of the crystal structure of a nucleozin analog bound to NP has revealed that NP dimer formation occurs via two ligand binding sites on each NP monomer; a hexameric structure was also observed, consisting of three NP dimers (Gerritz et al., 2011). Analogs of nucleozin have been identified which possess potent inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo; however, resistance can develop after just 5 in vitro passages (Kao et al., 2010). Resistance to nucleozin has also been observed among naturally circulating influenza strains, including the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which possesses mutations at the ligand-binding pocket (Gerritz et al., 2011, Kao et al., 2010, Sui et al., 2009). These studies support the concept that NP is a potential target for novel antivirals, but further optimization of nucleozin analogs will be required to increase their specificity and minimize drug resistance.",

Structure-based design has resulted in small molecules that inhibit the fusogenic conformational change of HA; however, these compounds cannot presently provide protection across a range of different HA subtypes (Bodian et al., 1993, Vavricka et al., 2011). However, an exception is arbidol [(ethyl-6-bromo-4- [(dimethylamino)methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[(phenylthio)methyl]-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate)], which has been licensed in Russia for the treatment of influenza A and B viruses (Leneva et al., 2009). Arbidol exerts immunemodulatory effects, as well as broad antiviral activity against influenza virus, RSV, rhinoviruses, coxsackie virus, HCV and chikungunya virus (Delogu et al., 2011, Shobugawa et al., in press). The mechanism of its antiviral activity against influenza was demonstrated through the identification of resistant variants with single amino acid changes in the HA2, which affected the HA fusion pH and conformational change (Leneva et al., 2009) (Table 1). An alternative approach made use of computational design of protein inhibitors targeting the HA stem region to block fusion. Protein inhibitors with improved cross-reactive binding affinity for group 1 HA have been achieved through screening of DNA-encoded library of protein variants, using yeast surface display followed by deep sequencing (Whitehead et al., 2012).",

These antibodies have been tested in vitro and in mice and ferrets, and exhibited significant protection upon challenge using different viral subtypes (Friesen et al., 2010, Koudstaal et al., 2009). The use of adoptive immunotherapy may be considered for pandemic preparedness, as cross-protection can be achieved regardless of the subtype of the emerging strains.

Derivatives of one of the 4 compounds (NSC125044) were synthesized (Jablonski et al., 2012, Walsh et al., 2011), and one of them showed an anti-influenza effect that was dependent on host RNase L activity (Walkiewicz et al., 2011).

DAS181 is a sialidase fusion construct designed to remove sialic acid from cell surfaces. It is composed of a catalytic domain of sialidase from the bacteria Actinomyces viscosus, with a human respiratory epithelium-anchoring domain fused to its C-terminus. DAS181 is well tolerated by the human immune system, as A. viscosus is a common oral bacterium. The human respiratory epithelium-anchoring domain contains a heparin-binding sequence that increases retention time and drug-potency (Malakhov et al., 2006).

DAS181 has also proven to be safe in mice exposed to high concentrations (up to 3 mg/kg/day) in dry-powder formulations. DAS181 was well tolerated at all dose levels; body size, food consumption and other parameters were not affected (Larson et al., 2011). In humans, an international phase II clinical trial was conducted, involving 297 patients with H1N1, H3N2 or influenza B virus infections.

It is composed of two subunits, HA1 and HA2, which are cleaved by host proteases from their HA0 precursor (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975). The cleavage of HA0 into functional HA1/HA2 activates virus infectivity, and is important for pathogenicity in human and avian hosts (Steinhauer, 1999). Functional HA is able to undergo conformational change in the low-pH endosomal environment, to induce membrane fusion followed by infection (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). Two proteases, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2), cleave the monobasic cleavage site of some HAs (Bottcher et al., 2006). Expression of these two proteases in MDCK cells supports the propagation of seasonal influenza viruses, in the absence of trypsin (Bottcher et al., 2009). Recently, TMPRSS4 was identified, and it was found to have a similar role in the activation of HA (Chaipan et al., 2009). The HA of some highly pathogenic influenza viruses possess a multibasic protease cleavage site, which is cleaved by furin and other related cellular proteases located in the trans-Golgi apparatus (Stieneke-Grober et al., 1992). However, the acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site within the HA does not always transform a low-pathogenic virus into a highly pathogenic one (Stech et al., 2009).",

Improvement in selectivity and potency was achieved by incorporating a synthetic amino acid residue, norvaline, into the protease inhibitor (Sielaff et al., 2011). The use of single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents to block the expression of TMPRSS2 also inhibits influenza virus infection in human airway epithelial cells (Bottcher-Friebertshauser et al., 2011). All of these studies have highlighted protease inhibitors as an alternative therapeutic approach. In addition to influenza, a recent report has also demonstrated that protease inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents against other respiratory viruses, including the SARS-coronavirus (Matsuyama et al., 2010), and thus may have wider applications future.",

Specific inhibitors such as U0126, which blocks the cascade at the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) level, result in nuclear retention of viral RNP complexes and impair the function of the nuclear export protein (NEP/NS2), suppressing virus production (Pleschka et al., 2001) (Table 2). A further study suggested that activation of the MAPK cascade leads to efficient RNP export as well as virus production, achieved by the accumulation of the viral HA on the cell surface, resulted from enhanced viral polymerase activity (Marjuki et al., 2007). U0126 exhibited high antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (Droebner et al., 2011, Qin et al., 2009), making it a promising drug.",

Upon recognition of pathogen infection or tissue damage, the NF-\u03baB pathway is strongly activated by cellular pattern recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors and multiple cytosolic receptors, such as retinoic inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases and NOD family proteins. NF-\u03baB-responsive genes affect a diverse array of cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell survival, and often directly control the course of infection by up-regulating a variety of antiviral genes (Iversen and Paludan, 2010). Influenza virus infection activates the NF-\u03baB pathway through activation of IKK2, as a result of the production of various cytokines (Julkunen et al., 2001). NF-\u03baB is known as the key regulator of cytokine expression, including interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 (Pahl, 1999). IFN-\u03b2 initiates the type I IFN defense program to mediate antiviral activities (Wolff and Ludwig, 2009), by binding to the cell-surface type I IFN receptor and activating the JAK/STAT and other pathways, which control the expression of various antiviral genes (Platanias, 2005).",

In fact, an in vivo study demonstrated that defects in COX-1 or COX-2 led to opposite effects in H3N2 virus-infected mice: while COX-1 deficiency was detrimental, COX-2 deficiency improved survival (Carey et al., 2005).",

In a recent study, we further demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitors suppressed H5N1 virus replication in vitro, suggesting that viral replication was dependent on the activation of COX-2 signaling pathways (Lee et al., 2011). Another study showed that treatment of H5N1 virus-infected mice with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, in combination with mesalazine and zanamivir, significantly improved survival (Zheng et al., 2008).

Interestingly, although there was significant T cell suppression, the production of protective antibodies by infected mice was not affected by AAL-R treatment. This differed from the action of antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, in which the reduction in tissue damage was the result of reduced viral burden. If AAL-R is used to treat influenza A infection in combination with antivirals, it will promote viral clearance as well as the clinical course (Walsh et al., 2011).

They reversibly and competitively inhibit the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reducing synthesis of cholesterol and mevalonate (Chong et al., 2001). In addition to their lipid-lowering activity, statins exert immunomodulatory effects (Table 2). They suppress the MHC-II expression induced by IFN-\u03b3, without modulating constitutive MHC-II expression, by reducing the inducible expression of CIITA, a general MHC-II controller, by inhibiting the activity of CIITA promoter IV. Inhibition of the inducible expression of MHC-II suppresses activation of CD4 T lymphocytes, reducing the inflammatory response (Kwak et al., 2000). Statins also have another immunomodulatory mechanism, via interaction with lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a glycoprotein in the \u03b22-integrin family (Weitz-Schmidt et al., 2001). LFA-1 is activated by engagement of the T-cell or chemokine receptor, and binds to the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to drive various downstream activities, including lymphocyte recirculation and leukocyte extravasation (Carlos and Harlan, 1994).",

The beneficial effect of statins has recently been challenged, as no beneficial effects on influenza patients were observed (Fleming et al., 2010, Vignuzzi et al., 2005). Further investigation should be carried out, especially to identify a possible beneficial effect of initiating statins near the onset of influenza illness or at the time of hospitalization.",

One possibility is that the inhibition and depletion of cholesterol biosynthesis disrupt the structure of membrane-resident lipid rafts, resulting in loose interactions between these micro-lipid domains. Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signal cascade required efficient nuclear cytoplasmic RNP localization, which is triggered by the accumulation of the influenza HA in cell membranes, and thus has a close association with lipid rafts. Statin treatment might interfere with this chain of events by lowering cholesterol biosynthesis during influenza infection, impairing the production of infectious virus.",

While targeting the virus provides a specific and direct inhibitory effect, targeting the host certainly provides other advantages, including a lower likelihood of drug resistance and immunomodulatory effects that may decrease tissue damage. Novel approaches that have both immunomodulatory and antiviral effects therefore deserve special attention. Furthermore, the application of antiviral drugs in combination with immunomodulatory agents provides a promising direction, as seen in recent in vivo studies (Zhirnov et al., 1984, Wang et al., 2009). Further preclinical and clinical trials will be needed to study the underlying mechanisms of action and confirm their beneficial effects against influenza in humans.",
