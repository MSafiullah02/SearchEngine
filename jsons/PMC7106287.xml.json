Preservation of sample integrity is essential for accurate test results, especially if detection or quantification of RNA is desired. Unlike DNA, RNA is unstable and is readily degraded by naturally occurring endonucleases (RNases) that are present in the environment and tissues. Samples for RNA testing should be handled with gloves to prevent contamination with RNases present on the skin. Samples for RNA testing should be promptly submitted to the laboratory or stored in a freezer at \u221280\u00b0C until forwarded for testing. Samples may also be treated with buffers designed to minimize RNA degradation, with several commercial additives being available for this purpose, but their use varies among laboratories. It is best to consult the specific laboratory for their protocol for sample submission. Although DNA tends to be more stable than RNA, naturally occurring endonucleases that degrade DNA do exist. Test samples should be aseptically collected and refrigerated or frozen until submission. The ability of PCR to detect extremely low levels of DNA in a submitted patient sample results in the very real potential of false-positive test results due to DNA contamination.",

The dye intercalates between double-stranded DNA formed in the PCR reaction and, when exposed to an excitation source, fluoresces. A laser scanner detects the fluorescence emitted by dye-impregnated DNA strands formed through the PCR amplification.

These real-time amplicon detection technologies include TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA USA) or hydrolysis probes,6 molecular beacon technology,7 and hybridization probes.8 Fluorescence is only detected if the probe is bound to the amplified target, thereby enhancing specificity to an already highly specific assay. These probes do not react with primer-dimers or other nonspecific products that may be generated during the PCR reaction as may occur with SYBR Green reactions. However, a well-designed and optimized SYBR Green amplification is a very effective testing technology. Unlike TaqMan probes, the SYBR Green reporter remains intact so a melt curve analysis can be performed on the amplification product. Melt curve analysis measures the dissociation characteristics of double-stranded DNA during heating. Melt curve analysis is sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous gene alleles by the dissociation patterns produced (Fig 3). The advancement of this technology to produce high-resolution melt analysis will provide higher sensitivity for SNP detection within entire dye-stained amplicons for genomic analysis.",

The inability to synthesize DNA from an RNA template is overcome by the use of a reverse-transcriptase (RT) enzyme before the PCR reaction. In RT-PCR, RNA is converted into a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). The cDNA produced is then used as a template in a conventional PCR reaction.

New technologies such as the lab-on-a-chip have been developed and have potential in veterinary point-of-care diagnostics. Defined as a miniaturized analytical laboratory constructed on a small chip, this technology has promising applications when combined with NAT diagnostic processes. Both PCR and LAMP assays have been used to facilitate the development of lab-on-a-chip\u2013based NAT devices.16 Such devices can offer molecular-based testing in a rapid, effective, low-cost, and disposable automatic format as a point-of-care diagnostic tool.",

Hybridization occurs between 2 cDNA sequences such as the nucleic acid probes immobilized on the solid surface of a chip and the mobile DNA, cDNA, or messenger RNA (mRNA) sample. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence allows for tighter noncovalent bonding between the 2 strands to occur. Probe-target hybridization is usually quantified through the detection of a fluorophore, silver, or chemiluminescence-labeled target. After the hybridization step is complete, the microarray is scanned. The fluorescent tags are excited by a laser, read by a microscopic camera, and computer integrated into a digital image of the array. Software analyzes each microarray spot calculating the red-to-green fluorescence ratio and subtracting out background data. The nature and relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target are determined. DNA microarrays have been used for the detection of infectious and genetic disease, cancer diagnostics, and forensic and genetic identification purposes. Microarray systems are very definitive and highly scalable because hundreds to tens of thousands of possible DNA elements can be interrogated in a single experiment.",

The approach used randomized primers in an RT-PCR to amplify any viral RNA that was present in the clinical sample. The PCR product was then hybridized to the microarray comprising 1600 probes, representing nearly 140 respiratory virus genomes. Viruses that were represented on the microarray were readily detected and identified by specific hybridization to the appropriate oligonucleotides. This methodology enabled the simultaneous detection of hundreds of viruses, including essentially all respiratory tract viruses. This microarray system greatly expanded the spectrum of detectable viruses in a single assay while simultaneously providing the capability to discriminate among viral subtypes.

Through computer analysis, the amount of mRNA bound to each site on the array is precisely measured, generating a profile of global gene expression within the cell. Once researchers have characterized the expression patterns of various genes involved in many diseases, the expression pattern of cDNA from an individual can be hybridized to determine if it matches the expression pattern of a known disease. If a gene is over expressed in a certain disease state, then more sample cDNA, compared with control cDNA, is detected. In microarray comparative genomic hybridization, the increased or decreased expression of a particular gene(s) is determined. A change in the number of copies of a particular gene may correlate to a certain disease state. Microarrays may also be used in veterinary diagnostics by comparing gene expression of infected cells or tissues with that of uninfected cells or tissues.

Metabolomics is a powerful investigative tool for studying the biochemical effects of disease and screening for potential pharmacologic agents. Alterations in the metabolic profile often present much earlier in the course of disease than induced histopathological changes. Metabolomics can be a sensitive, early indicator of a disease process, and because metabolites are conserved across species lines, screening patterns can be applied to a wide range of species.89\n",
