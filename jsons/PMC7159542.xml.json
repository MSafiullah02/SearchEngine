Briefly, there were three periods with changes in respiratory virus targets and algorithms during the study period: 1 from 2004 to November 2005, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, influenza A and B and adenovirus were identified using direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests or rapid respiratory culture with mixed cell lines and DFA in a 24\u2010well plate format, 2 from November 2005 to February 2008, rapid respiratory culture was replaced by in\u2010house molecular diagnostic tests where human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was also detected, 3 since February 2008, the in\u2010house molecular diagnostic tests were replaced by xTAG\u00ae RVP assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Ontario, Canada) with Rhinovirus/enterovirus and four types of coronavirus as additional targets to the original six viruses. In addition, an in\u2010house RT\u2010PCR for influenza A and B with better sensitivity for pandemic influenza A was implemented in March 2009. Prior to March 2009, molecular diagnostic tests are performed on nasopharyngeal swabs that tested negative by DFA and all throat swabs and lower respiratory tract samples; since March 2009, in\u2010house RT\u2010PCR for influenza A and B +/\u2212 xTAG\u00ae RVP assay was performed on all sample types regardless of DFA results.",

Differences in treatments provided and outcomes for the PICU admissions, including PICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and PICU and hospital mortality, were also described for each of the viruses. After identifying the three most commonly detected viruses, logistic regression analyses utilising the viral detection as an exposure and adjusting for potential confounding variables, such as chronic diseases, prematurity and other conditions, the need of endotracheal intubation in the PICU, and endotracheal intubation before or during the PICU stay. Linear combinations of each parameter estimate were calculated with interaction terms for co\u2010infections as multiple viral detections might have a synergistic effect on the outcomes. Linear regressions adjusting for the same set of potential confounding factors were performed to assess the effect of each virus on the log\u2010transformed continuous outcomes as PICU LOS, hospital LOS and invasive ventilation days. Lastly, the effect of having more than one virus was examined. Mann\u2013Whitney U test, Chi\u2010Squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare the continuous and nominal demographics, and treatment variables as appropriate, between the two groups. Then, regression analyses adjusting for the same potential confounding variables were repeated to compare the outcomes between patients with a single virus and multiple viruses.

The potential reasons could be related to our inclusion criteria, i.e. all critically ill children with acute respiratory disease.

Given that the severity of illness did not differ significantly among the three viruses at the time of the PICU admission, specific pathogenicity of each virus such as the higher likelihood of laryngotracheitis with parainfluenza virus infections might have led to the higher rate of endotracheal intubation. There was a significant increase in the number of invasive ventilation days with Rhinovirus/enterovirus versus RSV.

Differentiation between Rhinovirus and enterovirus is performed only by request from the clinicians. Thus a positive Rhinovirus/enterovirus result includes a broad range of viruses, which generally causes mild upper respiratory infections in healthy populations. A retrospective cohort study which includes all patients admitted to PICUs with respiratory illness and Rhinovirus/enterovirus at three urban centres reported a mortality rate of 2.1% (11/519) which was similar to our findings of 3.3% 18.

Our ability to identify mixed virus infection was limited before the use of molecular diagnostic tests in November 2005, and some cases with a predominant virus detected by DFA from their nasopharyngeal swabs might not have molecular diagnostic tests performed prior to March 2009 if no throat swabs or lower respiratory samples were submitted for testing. Another limitation is that PRISM III only represented the initial assessment at PICU admission. The higher rate of antibiotic use in admissions with multiple viruses might suggest that more of these patients presented to the PICU with a more severe clinical picture; nonetheless, the exact antibiotic indications could not be obtained from our database. A recently performed systematic review concluded that there was no difference in clinical disease severity between single infection and co\u2010infections of respiratory viruses; however, in their subgroup analysis, the authors found a higher mortality in preschool children with viral co\u2010infection as compared to other age groups 6. A small cohort study reported that infants with severe bronchiolitis due to co\u2010infections had higher odds to be admitted to the PICU than did those with a single virus; as in our study, the most dominant combination of the viruses was RSV and Rhinovirus 26. A single centre\u2010study investigating the effect of viral co\u2010infection in a two\u2010year retrospective study, in which the diagnostic panel did not include Rhinovirus/enterovirus, reported that the most common co\u2010infections were with adenovirus and RSV and found a significantly higher severity in patients with viral co\u2010infections 7. However, no difference in the risk of invasive ventilation requirement and ICU LOS was observed.

            "text": "There are several limitations to our study. Admission events with respiratory disease were selected based on a retrospective review of PICU admission diagnosis; thus, the population is likely to be heterogeneous, with a risk of some patients being misclassified. Some misclassifications would have occurred with the changes in respiratory virus testing algorithm overtime and the fact that not all patients were subjected to the same molecular diagnostic tests should be noted. A small number of patients might have multiple PICU admissions due to the same illness; each new admission was counted as a separate event in the analyses. The detection of a viral pathogen around the time of admission does not necessarily represent a causal relationship with the respiratory symptoms as some of the virus detected on the PICU admission could be a result of chronic viral shedding from a prior infection. A study reported that only Rhinovirus\u2010A and Rhinovirus\u2010C were associated with acute respiratory illness, hospitalisation, and subsequent serious illness among the subtypes 27. However, an enterovirus containing many species of virus from the same picornaviridae family was grouped together by the diagnostic test in our study. Similarly, RSV A versus RSV B, parainfluenza virus 1\u20134 and various adenoviruses, influenza A and B viral strains were not differentiated. Other important contributors to disease severity such as secondary or concomitant bacterial infection, existing immune\u2010compromised condition, were not considered in the data analysis 28, 29. To minimise this potential bias, antibiotic usage was used as a proxy, but some of the antibiotics would have been started just as empiric treatment. Finally, even though our study had one of the largest cohorts in the PICU setting, it was underpowered to evaluate the specific effects of interactions among the various viruses. It is possible that only certain combinations of co\u2010infections are associated with worse outcomes. A case\u2010control study of hospitalised children with acute respiratory infection in Vietnam showed 9.5% of the cohort had multiple viral infections 8, with RSV increasing the risk of hospitalisation when co\u2010infected with Rhinovirus, hMPV and parainfluenza virus, but not with influenza A virus. These types of interactions should be further investigated in specific populations such as PICU patients in a multicentre study with a larger sample size.",

            "text": "Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most common respiratory viral pathogen detected in a large cohort of children presented with acute respiratory disease during admissions to a PICU, surpassing RSV as the main culprit. The risk of endotracheal intubation in the PICU and before or during the PICU stay was higher for admissions with parainfluenza virus detection as compared to RSV and Rhinovirus/enterovirus; however, there was no significant difference in the risk of needing endotracheal intubation before or during the PICU stay in the patients with multiple viruses versus single virus. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the effects of multiple viral infections, their interactions and the role of bacterial co\u2010infection in paediatric population.",
