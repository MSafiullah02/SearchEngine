Whereas in Economics of Shortage, he mentioned paternalism as the source of soft budget constraints, in his later, more complete contribution (written under conditions of freedom) The Socialist System: The Political Economy of Communism, he mentioned communist party rule as the source and pillar of the socialist economic system and its phenomena. When discussing the success of Chinese economic reforms, especially in comparison with the less spectacular economic reforms that took place in Central and Eastern Europe, Kornai emphasized the fundamental role of freedom and democracy that was absent in China despite the growth miracle.1 Nevertheless, he never discussed why China did not become a democracy. Furthermore, the experience of China (but also Vietnam, Singapore or even Thailand) appears to challenge modernization theory (Lipset 1959; Przeworski and Limongi 1997) according to which countries tend to become, or remain, democracies as they develop economically.",

By 2000, 120 of the world\u2019s 192 nations were liberal democracies. Recent developments tend to suggest that it is far from clear whether worldwide convergence towards democracy will continue. Autocratic tendencies have appeared in democratic countries such as Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland, to name a few.2 A key question is whether China, the biggest country in the world with miraculous growth over the last four decades, will evolve towards democracy. So far, to put it mildly, little evidence points in that direction. Reasons thus can be found for being skeptical that countries should all become democratic as they develop economically. Could modernization theories have overlooked slow-moving forces such as culture that may facilitate or hamper transition to democracy? Strikingly, although culture often is considered a bedrock of many social and economic processes, the role of culture in democratization largely has been ignored until now.",

            "text": "In this paper, we present a simple formal model of democratization that includes the individualistic-collectivist dimension of culture. A key difference between those cultural types is that a collectivist culture creates stronger pressure towards conformity and stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation. We show that, starting from an initial situation of autocracy, a collectivist society is less likely to adopt a democratic regime than an individualistic society, irrespective of whether a collectivist culture may be more effective in overcoming collective action problems. In our model, collectivist societies often end up in equilibrium having a \u201cgood\u201d autocracy, i.e., an autocracy that does not act in a predatory way toward its citizens because good autocracies tend not to be overthrown by collectivist societies, unlike those of individualistic societies. That outcome occurs because of the stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation in collectivist societies. Furthermore, if political institutions can influence culture over time, our central prediction continues to hold: collectivist societies are less likely to end up with democracy. Note that those results do not follow automatically from a congruence between individualistic values and democracy. Countries with individualistic cultures must still overcome collective action problems to transition from autocracy to democracy, which is a non-trivial barrier. Indeed, we do observe countries with relatively high individualism scores and low democracy scores (e.g., Morocco). Yet, a striking result of our model is that even if one assumes that the collective action problem is much more acute in individualistic societies, such societies are still more likely to end up with democracy over time than collectivist societies.",

            "text": "We test the predictions of the model empirically, using the well-known Hofstede measure of individualism-collectivism. We find a strong and robust effect of individualism on average polity scores between 1980 and 2010. A one standard deviation increase in the individualism score is associated with as much as a four-point increase in polity scores, a large magnitude. That result holds even when we control for all of the variables that have been used in the literature on democratization, including measures of economic development. We also document evidence that countries with collectivist cultures experience autocratic breakdowns more frequently, suggesting less collective action failure in collectivist cultures. We do find strong evidence that in collectivist cultures, conditional on autocratic breakdown, transition to autocracy is more likely while in individualistic cultures, transition to democracy is more likely. While the main result is tested using the well-known polity data, those last results are tested using the new data on autocracies and autocratic transitions assembled by Geddes et al. (2014). Interestingly, other cultural variables, such as trust or other cultural dimensions constructed by Hofstede (2001)\u2014power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, long-term orientation\u2014do not have a significant or a robust effect on average polity scores, whereas the effect of individualism is very robust.",

            "text": "Because two-way causality may exist between democracy and culture, we apply instrumental variables to study the effect of culture on democratization. The first instrumental variable is a measure of historical pathogen prevalence. That variable has been argued (see, e.g., Fincher et al. 2008; Murray and Schaller 2010) to have a direct effect on the choice of collectivist culture as stronger pathogen prevalence created better survival prospects for communities that adopted more collectivist values, imposing stronger limits on individualistic behavior, being less open to foreigners and placing strong emphasis on tradition and stability of social norms. The second instrumental variable is a measure of genetic distance between countries based on differences in cross-sectional frequencies of blood types. That instrument is adopted as a proxy for vertical cultural transmission from parents to children. Since the genetic pool evolves relatively slowly and it is unlikely that neutral genetic markers (e.g., blood types) changed since the industrial revolution, one can use genetic distance in terms of such markers to instrument cultural differences.3 Because of the pitfalls related to cross-country regressions, we must be careful in interpreting the instrumental variable regression results as causal. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with culture playing an important role in transitions from autocracy to democracy as well as in transitions from autocracy to autocracy.",

            "text": "Our paper contributes to an immense body of work on the determinants of democratization. Since Lipset\u2019s (1959) seminal work, a large literature, both theoretical and empirical, has been devoted to understanding the determinants of democratization. Lipset emphasized the role of economic development and, thus, not surprisingly, most disputes on democratization have been about whether economic development is a fundamental determinant of democracy. Lipset was taking a broad view of economic and social modernization creating conditions for increases in the demand for democracy. In recent years, debates about the importance of economic development have been revived after the work of Przeworski and Limongi (1997). Using data between 1950 and 1990 for 135 countries, they showed that the correlation between income and democracy was explained not so much by economic development leading to democratization, but rather by the fact that once countries have achieved a certain level of economic development, they usually never revert to authoritarian regimes. Countries could opt for democratic or dictatorial regimes for reasons that are unrelated to economic development, but if richer countries develop stable democracies, one will see a strong correlation between income per capita and democracy.4 Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) argued that democratization mostly was an elite strategy to commit to redistributive transfers in response to revolutionary threats.5 Some of the recent studies question causation from development to democracy or even the correlation between the two. Acemoglu et al. (2005, 2008) showed that the relationship between income (or education) and democracy, mainly is a feature of cross-sectional data and that when performing panel data analysis, one ceases to find a significant relationship between those variables.6 Acemoglu et al. (2014) in recent work even found that democracy affects growth, a conclusion opposite to that of modernization theory. On the other hand, Boix and Stokes (2003) found that by taking data far enough into the past (to the second half of the nineteenth century), one can recover a significant relation between income per capita and democracy. Treisman (2012) also found an effect of economic development in the medium to long run, with democratic transitions happening more often after the exit of a dictator.",

            "text": "To find a mention of cultural determinants of democracy, one has to go back to Almond and Verba (1963), who emphasized the importance of civic culture as a prerequisite for democracy in a comparative study of five countries (Italy, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico). Inglehart (2002) and, more recently, Inglehart and Weizel (2005), using the World Values Survey, argued that modernization leads to changes in values towards more self-expression and stronger emphasis on individual liberty.7 According to them, those changes in values underlie stronger support for democracy. Their study is the closest to ours because the values they emphasize are close to individualism as we define it (more on that below). However, their focus is not the effect of culture on democracy. Instead, they emphasize cultural changes brought about by modernization. Our approach is different: we take culture as slow-moving (Roland 2004),8 thus potentially affecting faster-moving variables, such as political institutions. We do not deny that culture may be affected by political institutions and other variables, which is why we try to isolate the effect of culture on political institutions by adopting an instrumental variables method. While our research suggests that individualism affects both income per capita and democracy, we do not rule out a separate effect of income on democracy. Furthermore, we document that, in contrast to other measures of culture (e.g., religion, trust), individualism is a robust predictor of democracy. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to explore systematically how culture (individualism) can influence democratization processes.",

The current model shares certain basic features with the Acemoglu\u2013Robinson model: two groups, the elite and the poor, are considered, a Markov structure is assumed, and the effect of income inequality is similar. The differences are, however, conceptually very substantial. In their model, relevant decisions are taken by the elite. In our model, decisions (to revolt or not) are taken by the mass of people, or their representatives within the elite, and uncertainty over the outcomes of collective action plays a much larger role. The Acemoglu\u2013Robinson model incorporates absolutely no cultural component and the elites decide between either endogenously redistributing income to the poor when they threaten revolt, in order to avert a revolution, or to establish democracy as a credible commitment to redistribution. The probability of success of collective action plays an important role in their model. The more likely successful collective action is, the more likely it is that the elites will prefer to redistribute income to the poor to avoid a revolution. On the other hand, if that probability is lower, they will choose instead to establish democracy to avert a revolt. In contrast, in our model the collective action\u2019s probability of success (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$q_{k}$$\\end{document}qk) does not play a significant role in determining long-term outcomes.

            "text": "To measure individualism/collectivism, we use the country level data developed by Hofstede (2001) who initially used surveys of IBM employees in about 30 countries in the 1960s. To avoid cultural biases in the way questions were framed, the survey was translated into local languages by a team of English and local language speakers. With new waves of surveys and replication studies, Hofstede\u2019s measure of individualism has been expanded to more than 90 countries.15 The individualism score measures the extent to which it is believed that individuals are supposed to take care of themselves as opposed to being strongly integrated and loyal to a cohesive group. Individuals in countries with a high level of the individualism index value personal freedom and status, while individuals in countries with a low level of the index value harmony and conformity. Hofstede\u2019s index, as well as the measures of individualism from other studies, uses a broad array of survey questions to establish cultural values. Factor analysis is used to summarize data and construct indices. In Hofstede\u2019s analysis, the index of individualism is the first factor in work goal questions about the value of personal time, freedom, interesting and fulfilling work, etc. This component loads positively on valuing individual freedom, opportunity, achievement, advancement, recognition and negatively on valuing harmony, cooperation, relations with superiors. Although Hofstede\u2019s data were initially collected mostly with the purpose of understanding differences in IBM\u2019s corporate culture, the main advantage of Hofstede\u2019s measure of individualism is that it has been validated in a large number of studies. The ranking of countries across various studies and measures (see Hofstede (2001) for a review) is very stable. Hofstede\u2019s measure has been used extensively in the cross-cultural psychology literature, which views the individualism-collectivism cleavage as the main cultural cleavage across countries (see Heine 2008). The Hofstede data also correlate quite well with the more recent data by Schwartz (1994, 2006).16 Panel B of Fig. 2 shows the geographic distribution of individualism scores.",

One can argue, as we do in this paper, that individualistic culture has a positive effect on democracy, but one can also make an argument in the other direction: the more people live under democracy and are accustomed to the protection of the rights of individual citizens, the more they espouse an individualistic world view with its values of freedom and opportunity, equality of citizens before the law and constraints on the executive (see for example Persson and Tabellini 2009). As we showed above, this does not change the results of the model, but would affect the empirical analysis. Ideally, we would like to have a measure of individualism and collectivism much earlier in time, prior to democratization history. Unfortunately, we do not have such data. We are therefore forced, in an attempt to deal with the potential endogeneity of culture, to use instrumental variables.",

(2008).17 These historical data are very important because they give a good idea of the pathogen environment populations were facing in the past, including the very distant past, and in any case before the post-WWII epidemiological revolution when big public health changes started to occur. Panel C of Fig. 2 shows the geographical distribution of historic pathogen prevalence. Given a strong correlation between pathogen prevalence and collectivism, the above studies argue that stronger pathogen prevalence pushed communities to adopt more collectivist values emphasizing tradition, putting stronger limits on individual behavior, and showing less openness towards foreigners. Collectivism is thus understood as a defense mechanism created to cope with greater pathogen prevalence. Obviously, historical pathogen prevalence is only one of the possible reasons for the adoption of collectivism. Nevertheless, as an instrumental variable, it can provide a very useful role in measuring the effect of individualism on democratization. Historical pathogen prevalence can also be argued to satisfy the exclusion restriction since historical pathogen prevalence is not likely to have a direct effect on political regime choice. Indeed, one cannot claim that autocracy is more efficient than democracy, or vice versa, in dealing with pathogen prevalence. Autocracy suffers from lack of transparency, as was seen in China recently with the SARS and COVID-19 epidemic, and is not necessarily more efficient in dealing with a humanitarian disaster, as was the case with the catastrophic handling of the 2008 massive flooding from cyclone Nargis in Myanmar. Likewise, democracy may or may not lack speed in response to a major health epidemic.18",

This is a measure of genetic distance. To the extent that culture is transmitted mainly from parents to children (see for example Fernandez et al. 2004; Fernandez and Fogli 2006, and the models by Bisin and Verdier 2000, 2001), so are genes. Populations that interbreed a lot should be genetically and culturally close because a similar parental transmission mechanism is at work in both cases. Therefore, measures of genetic distance can be seen as a proxy measure of differences in cultural values. Note that these are \u201cneutral\u201d genetic markers that have no direct effect on fitness (i.e., ability to think, run, work, etc.) and thus economic, cultural or political outcomes. Because genetic pools evolve slowly, these markers are very unlikely to be affected by economic outcomes, and thus we can exclude reverse causality in our instrumental variable estimates. To be clear, this particular identification strategy does not postulate that the first stage captures a direct causal effect between genes (here blood types) and culture. Instead, this strategy exploits the correlation between cultural and genetic transmission from patents to offspring. We combine this variable with the other instrumental variable mentioned above and apply standard statistical tests for the exclusion restriction. Our measure of genetic distance successfully passes these tests, and one can thus feel more comfortable using it as instrumental variable.19",

Note that in the two IV regressions, the first stage is very significant, indicating no problem of weak instrument. Moreover, the p value of 0.856 for the overidentifying restriction test confirms that one cannot reject the null of the instrumental variables being correctly excluded at any standard significance level. Note that the IV coefficients are somewhat higher than the OLS coefficient, indicating a potential measurement error.

Inglehart (1999) argues that interpersonal trust is conducive to stable democracies. In Table 2, we assess whether including these cultural characteristics alters the strength of the individualism-democracy link. Specifically, we control for the four additional Hofstede indexes, the share of Muslim population in 1970 [these data are from Barro and McCleary (2003)], and generalized trust (taken from the World Values Survey (WVS); an average value across available waves of the WVS). The share of Muslim population has a significantly negative coefficient, which is consistent across specifications.22 The only other cultural characteristic with similar consistency across specifications is uncertainty avoidance. Interestingly, although trust, the cultural variable the most used by economists, is positively correlated with Polity IV scores, this correlation disappears once we control for individualism scores.

First, Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011, 2017) document a potential causal effect of individualism on income per capita and the quality of institutions. Hence, there could be an identification problem when both variables are used as regressors. Second, there might be reverse causality, i.e., democracy may affect the level of economic development, quality of institutions, level of inequality, and the extractive/non-extractive nature of the economy. Such endogeneity not only yields biased estimates of the coefficients on these economic variables but it is also likely to generate a downward bias in the estimate of the coefficient on individualism.24 As a result, the estimated coefficient on individualism scores likely provides a lower bound for the \u201ctrue\u201d coefficient. In short, one should exercise caution in interpreting regression coefficients in this specification, and also bear in mind that the estimated effect of individualism on democracy is likely to be understated.",

In a first step, we examine the relationship between individualism and the frequency of democracy, which is defined as the fractions of years a country has continuously had a non-negative polity score. One may interpret this frequency as measuring the length of democracy in a country. While this measure does not take into account the quality of democracy, one can argue that this measure is closer to the model as the latter predicts that individualist cultures will on average adopt democracy earlier. We ran the same regressions as in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 using length of democracy as the dependent variable and we reached essentially the same conclusions as before.

Assuming that a collectivist culture displays a stronger taste for conformity and a stronger aversion to institutional innovation even if it might be better at overcoming collective action problems, the model predicts that, starting from autocracy as the initial regime, an individualistic culture will have a higher likelihood of switching to democracy than a collectivist culture. The reason is that a collectivist culture will tend to stick to a \u201cgood\u201d non-predatory autocracy, which will not be the case with an individualistic culture.",

To the extent one believes our instrumental variable analysis, these effects may be interpreted as causal. Using long-difference regressions, we also find long-run effects of individualism on polity scores. Using the Geddes et al. (2014) data base on autocracies, we also found that collectivist autocracies have higher frequency of regime breakdowns than individualist autocracies. Consistent with the model, collectivist countries are more likely to experience a transition towards autocracy while individualist countries are more likely to experience a transition towards democracy.",

In particular, as countries with collectivist cultures develop economically, they will not necessarily evolve towards democracy or might do so more slowly or possibly only under the effect of an exceptional crisis. This implication is in stark contrast with modernization theories. Countries like China, Vietnam or Singapore, which have experienced considerable economic success in recent decades have not adopted Western-style democracies. Similarly, countries that have experienced a genuine democratization process like Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Korea have done so relatively recently and their average polity score over the last 30 years have not been better than Guatemala, Panama or Peru. Another implication of the model is that in the long run, we should observe only stable democracies and stable \u201cgood\u201d autocracies. Testing such a prediction and analyzing factors affecting political stability is beyond the scope of this paper.",
