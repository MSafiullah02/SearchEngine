            "text": "Enhancing immunity through optimizing nutrition has received increasing emphasis over the last 3 decades. Respiratory disease alone is responsible for 28% of deaths in beef calves before weaning (USDA, 2011) , and 16% of feedlot cattle show signs of respiratory disease (USDA, 2013) . Respiratory disease increases medication costs, reduces rates of gain, and negatively affects quality grades at harvest (Gardner et al., 1999) , although segregating and feeding treat- ABSTRACT: The importance of optimal mineral and vitamin nutrition on improving immune function and health has been recognized in the preceding decades. In the southeast, beef cattle are raised predominantly on forages that may be limiting in nutrients for optimal health, especially trace minerals such as Cu, Zn, and Se. Clinical deficiencies of these nutrients produce classic symptoms that are common to several nutrient deficiencies (e.g., slow growth and unthrifty appearance); however, subclinical deficiencies are more widespread and more difficult to detect, yet may result in broader economic losses. Dietary mineral concentrations often considered adequate for maximum growth, reproductive performance, or optimal immune function have been found to be insufficient at times of physiological stress (weaning, transport, comingling, etc.) , when feed intake is reduced. The impacts of these deficiencies on beef cattle health are not apparent until calves have been subjected to these stressors. Health problems that are exacerbated by mineral or vitamin deficiencies include bovine respiratory disease, footrot, retained placenta, metritis, and mastitis. Many micronutrients have antioxidant properties through being components of enzymes and proteins that benefit animal health. In dairy cattle, high levels of supplemental Zn are generally associated with reduced somatic cell counts and improved foot health, possibly reflecting the importance of Zn in maintaining effective epithelial barriers. Neutrophils isolated from ruminants deficient in Cu or Se have reduced ability to kill ingested bacteria in vitro. Supplemental vitamin E, in its role as an intracellular antioxidant has been shown to decrease morbidity in stressed calves. There is more understanding of the important biological role that these nutrients play in the functioning of the complex and multifaceted immune system. However, there is still much to be learned about determining the micronutrient status of herds (and hence when supplementation will be beneficial), requirements for different genetic and environmental conditions, understanding the bioavailability of these nutrients from feedstuffs and forages, quantifying the bioavailability of different supplemental sources of these nutrients, and identifying the impact of dietary antagonists on these nutrients. ed cattle a greater amount of time mitigated some of these negative consequences (Holland et al., 2010) . Duff and Galyean (2007) reviewed factors both preand post-weaning that affect occurrence rates and outcomes of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and included the status of micronutrients as factors contributing to BRD incidence.",

Dietary energy, protein, mineral, and vitamin concentrations have profound effects on immune function (Beisel, 1996; Calder, 2013) . Specifically, mineral and vitamin deficiencies or excesses alter various components of the immune system (Wintergerst et al., 2007; McClure, 2008) . Dietary requirements for minerals and vitamins for optimizing immune function may be greater than those needed for maximal growth or reproductive performance. This is complicated by variability in the ability of cattle to re-tain and mobilize different micronutrients.

Nutritional intervention cannot prevent all disease but may lessen the severity of morbidity, and incidences of mortality.

Immune cells of the innate system initiate the inflammatory response and process and present foreign particles (antigens) to the adaptive immune system.

These lymphocytes have matured in the thymus, and then reside in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid areas. Different subclasses of T lymphocytes provide the primary defense against viral infection (T cytotoxic cells), or produce cytokines (T helper cells) that enhance antibody responses, regulate the level of the immune response, or stimulate macrophages. Measures of the cellular immune response include in vitro assays of cell proliferation in response to a mitogen, such as phytohemmaglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A, and measures of cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. An analysis of cell populations can be conducted through flow cytometry. Another assessment, an intradermal injection of PHA coupled with measurements of skin-fold thickness has been conducted in experiments with ruminants. This in vivo test elicits a reaction with many features of a delayed hypersensitivity response and is thought to correlate with the animal's ability to mount a cell mediated response (Tizard, 2000) .",

Adequate Zn status has long been recognized as required for normal wound healing. In a Zn deficient animal, Zn supplementation increases the rate of epithelial tissue repair and maintains cellular integrity. Evidence for the importance of Zn in ruminants includes the effects of lethal trait A46. This is a rare genetic disorder that has been found in dairy cattle that results in reduced capacity of the intestine to absorb Zn. Calves homozygous for this trait become Zn deficient after birth and will die within 5 mo of age unless aggressively supplemented with Zn. These calves possess normal numbers of functional lymphocyte subpopulations at birth, but the activity of these lymphocytes is altered as the calves become Zn deficient (Perryman et al., 1989) . Delayed wound healing is observed and infection is 1 of the more common causes of mortality in these calves (Machen et al., 1996) . Engle et al. (1997) reported that after 21 d, calves fed a basal diet containing 17 mg Zn/kg DM had a depressed response to an intradermal injection of PHA compared to calves fed the basal diet supplemented with 23 mg of Zn/ kg DM. This depression in immune response occurred before any differences in plasma and liver Zn were detected. Using lambs fed a semi-purified diet (3.7 mg of Zn/kg DM), Droke and Spears (1993) reported that severely Zn-deficient lambs had reduced in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA, but an increased response to pokeweed mitogen. Marginally Zn-deficient lambs (basal plus 5 mg Zn/kg DM as Zn oxide) did not differ from Zn-adequate lambs (basal plus 40 mg Zn/kg DM as Zn oxide) for any immune response measure. Fraker and King (2001) proposed that as Zn becomes limiting, lymphopoiesis is downregulated while cells of the myeloid lineage (neutrophils, etc.) are pro-tected to maintain the first line of immunity (the innate response). In early research, residual lymphocytes from Zn-deficient mice retained their functions and were possibly more potent than normal lymphocytes (Cook-Mills and Fraker, 1993) . Thus, the severity and length of exposure to Zn deficiency affects the magnitude of impairment of immune function.",

George et al.

Brazle (1992) reported that Zn methionine decreased the incidence of foot rot by 55% in grazing calves (2.4 vs. 5.4%). In addition, calves supplemented with Zn methionine gained more weight during the grazing period. Moore et al. (1988) reported that hoof growth and wear were simi-lar in dairy cows fed a control and supplemental Zn (as Zn-methionine) diet during a 1-yr study; however, they observed improved hoof scores for texture, heel cracks, and interdigital dermatitis in Zn methioninesupplemented cows. In a summary of 12 trials, lactating dairy cows supplemented with Zn (180 to 400 mg/d) as Zn-methionine had lower somatic cell counts (196 vs. 294 \u00d7 10 3 cells/mL; Kellogg et al., 2004) . These changes in the incidence of footrot and the level of somatic cell counts may reflect the importance of Zn in maintaining effective epithelial barriers at these sites. Zinc is required for the incorporation of cysteine into keratin (Hsu and Anthony, 1971 ). The keratin lining of the teat canal protects the teat from bacterial invasion (Nickerson, 1985) .

            "text": "Neutrophils from Cu deficient lambs (Jones and Suttle, 1981) and calves (Boyne and Arthur, 1981; Torre et al., 1996) had reduced ability to kill ingested bacteria in vitro. These neutrophils had decreased activity of the Cu metalloenzyme, superoxide dismutase. Ceruloplasmin and superoxide dismutase, Cu-containing enzymes, have anti-inflammatory activity. Superoxide dismutase prevents oxidative tissue damage from superoxide radicals. Impaired microbicidal activity may also be a direct result of decreased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide radicals produced by superoxide dismutase-mediated reduction of superoxide radicals. Hydrogen peroxide radicals are utilized by the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system for the formation of powerful oxidizing agents, such as hypochlorous acid, and for generation of hydroxyl radicals, also potent oxidizers (Stabel and Spears, 1990) . Although this has not always been observed, Arthington et al. (1995) found no difference in neutrophil bactericidal activity in heifers marginally deficient (55 d on a low Cu and high Mo diet) or adequate in Cu, based on liver Cu concentrations. Saker et al. (1994) reported enhanced monocyte function in growing beef calves supplemented with Cu-lysine as compared with controls fed no supplemental Cu (16 vs. 7 mg of Cu/kg DM). Monocytes from Cu-lysine supplemented calves had enhanced oxidative burst and phagocytic activities (Saker et al., 1994) . A trend for decreased tumor necrosis factor production by monocytes from calves fed levels of Mo that are antagonistic to Cu (Gengelbach and Spears, 1998) , and lower plasma tumor necrosis factor concentrations after an infectious bovine rhinotrachitis virus challenge in calves supplemented with Mo compared with Cu adequate calves have been observed. Ward et al. (1993) reported that prolonged exposure to Mo (10 mg/kg DM) and S (0.2%) decreased in vivo cell mediated immune function in feeder cattle as measured by an intradermal injection of PHA. However, supplementation of Cu (5 mg/kg DM as Cu sulfate or Cu lysine) to steers with adequate Cu status did not improve animal performance or affect antibody production to ovalbumin, or impact in vivo cell mediated immune response (intradermal PHA). In another study, Cu supplementation (5 mg/kg DM for 133 d) increased antibody titers to ovalbumin (Ward and Spears, 1999) . In addition, when transportation stress was applied, stressed calves supplemented with Cu had increased humoral response to pig red blood cells and increased delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to dinitrochlorobenzene; however, Cu depressed these responses in unstressed cattle (Ward and Spears, 1999) . Supplemental Mo (5 mg/kg DM) did not affect any immune response measurement in calves, even though plasma Cu and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were decreased (Ward and Spears, 1999) . Antibody responses tended to be enhanced by Cu supplementation (either 10 or 20 mg supplemental Cu/kg DM to a control diet containing 7 mg/kg DM) in growing Angus steers; however, the response varied by the antigen administered (Dorton et al., 2003) . Results with ruminants indicate little effect of Cu deficiency on specific immune function. While their specific immune function tests were not different (antibody production to pig red blood cells and in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis), 33% of the calves fed the high Mo diet died or were removed from the study due to disease, versus no calves fed control, high iron, or supplemental Cu, indicating the importance of Cu to the entire immune system .",

If the respiratory bursts were compromised, there would be reduced free radical generation and, thus, decreased killing capacity in Se-deficient neutrophils (Suttle and Jones, 1989) .

Selenium supplementation reduced the severity and duration of acute coliform mastitis caused by E. coli (Erskine et al., 1989) but not Staphylococcus aureus (Erskine et al., 1990) . The difference may be due to the nature of the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infection versus E. coli infection. E. coli grows quickly, eliciting a large neutrophil influx into the mammary gland, which is enhanced by Se. Staphylococcus aureus grows more slowly and does not elicit an acute inflammatory response, and there was no benefit from Se. This highlights the complexity of the immune response and how different pathogens try to evade it. Rate of clinical mastitis was negatively correlated with plasma Se concentrations in 9 dairy herds in Ohio (Weiss et al., 1990) . Hall et al. (2013) fed calves alfalfa hay harvested from land that had been fertilized with various levels of sodium selenite; all of the Se-enriched forages (0.95 to 3.26 mg Se/kg DM) exceeded recommended Se concentrations (0.10 mg Se/kg DM; NRC, 1996) .

However, post-weaning morbidity results are potentially confounded for the unsupplemented calves because a portion of the calves on this treatment had been fed supplemental feed due to a lack of forage availability because of drought; this preweaning acclimation to feed probably reduced weaning stress and thus decreased their susceptibility to BRD. Ahola et al.

A negative control received no supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn; and 2 supplemental treatments were formulated to receive NRC (1996) recommended levels of supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn as sulfates or a combination of sulfates and mineral proteinate sources.

Oxidants, including free radicals, are products of many metabolic activities and can damage animal tissues. Oxidants are produced at greater levels during detoxification of many chemicals and with exercise, stress, tissue injury, and infection (Nockels, 1996) . Under these conditions, the ratio between antioxidants and these reactive oxygen metabolites may become unbalanced, and the structural and functional integrity of cells would be compromised. Peroxidation of fatty acids in cellular membranes reduces the fluidity of cell membranes. This decreased fluidity appears to decrease the ability of lymphocytes to respond to immune challenges (Bendich, 1993) . Vitamin E and the carotenoids have been most often studied as to their role in immune function. With the possible exception of vitamin E, there has been minimal research conducted in cattle, particularly beef cattle, on the effect of supplemental vitamins on immune function.",

Cattle monocytes produced the active form of the vitamin (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 ) in response to bacterial challenge through toll-like receptor signaling (Nelson et al., 2010) , and this locally-produced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 upregulated genes involved in the innate immune system (Nelson et al., 2010; Merriman et al., 2015) . Newly-published research (Nelson et al., in press) challenges assumptions that beef cattle are generally adequate in vitamin D because of exposure to sunlight and concentrations in forages; these researchers found that whereas all cows had adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 , most newborn calves (spring-born) had low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 .

In beef cattle, there was a reduction in the percentage of heifers with vertical fissures (sand cracks) when supplemented with biotin at 10 mg/d (Campbell et al., 2000) . Duff and Galyean (2007) summarized published research on the effect of supplementing trace minerals to receiving cattle and found, at best, the responses were mixed for Cu, Zn, and Se; and there had been minimal research for Mn. These mixed responses are derived from interactions between nutrients in typical ruminant diets, differences in bioavailability of micronutrients (both in the basal diet and from supplemental sources), unknown micronutrient status of test animals (hence variations in body stores), variations in pathogens, and genetic variation in cattle. More is not always better; Berrett et al. (2015) reported improved G:F in cattle fed no supplemental trace minerals throughout the feedlot phase. This negative control diet contained 58 mg Zn, 7 mg Cu, and 26 mg Mn/kg DM, and was compared with diets supplemented with an additional 30 mg Zn, 10 mg Cu, 20 mg Mn/kg DM, or with 100 mg Zn, 20 mg Cu, and 50 mg Mn/kg DM from varying sources. More basic research that increases the ability to quantify micronutrient status and that effect on response to supplementation is needed. More information is needed on the contribution of basal feeds to micronutrient status, as well as information on the bioavailability of supplemental micronutrients.",

These trace minerals and vitamins are (or are a part of) important antioxidant systems in the body. Basic research indicates that they have additional roles as enzyme components in other critical pathways.

In addition, various pathogens interact differently with the complex immune system. While nutrient requirements for some aspects of immunity may be greater than those required for growth, some aspects of immune function probably have a high priority for nutrients and would not be depressed until a severe deficiency existed.
