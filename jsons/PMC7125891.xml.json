In the air-conditioning field, the increasingly concern with sick building syndrome has brought the humidity control into a new perspective. Underestimated ventilation rates usually result in poor indoor air quality, with a high concentration of volatile organic compounds, smoke, bacteria and other contaminants [1]. Epidemiological studies indicate a direct connection between inadequate levels of moisture and the incidence of allergies, in addition to infectious respiratory diseases. Events such as the outbreak of Legionella in 1976 and the more recent SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) shed a new light over indoor air quality control and regulations [2].",

In fact, the required fresh air volume per occupant/hour imposed by indoor air-quality standards has typically doubled over the last three decades [3], [4]. However, since the outside fresh air has to be brought to the thermal comfort condition, increased ventilation rates also imply increased thermal loads, which in turn will demand air chillers with increased cooling capacity. Accordingly, there is a trade-off between indoor air quality and energy consumption, which is also of main concern of private and public sectors.",

            "text": "All-air systems usually employ multi-zone air-conditioning equipment, with individual reheat coils. Separate single ducts from the air-handling unit are distributed to each room, which is individually controlled. When the room air humidity exceeds a limit value, the humidistat takes control of the cooling coil, calling for additional cooling so as to dehumidify the air to the desired level. At this point, the air is excessively cold to be supplied to the room, which causes the thermostat to set off the reheat coil, with the objective of bringing the air temperature back to the comfort condition, as depicted in Fig. 1\n. The steepness of the room sensible heating ratio, represented by the dashed line, prevents the fan-coil process (curve EA\u2013LA) to intersect it, which can only be accomplished by the reheat process. Although it provides a satisfactory individual control of each zone, this constitutes a very energy wasteful design, since the air is continuously cooled and reheated. Moreover, it requires both temperature and humidity sensors and controls, which might represent a significant increase to the total cost of the system.",

Adsorption is primarily used for component separation from a gaseous mixture, and is widely employed in the chemical industry. The main advantage is that the material pore size can be designed for selective adsorption of a given component, allowing even trace amounts to be removed. In air-conditioning systems, silica-gel has been used to remove the air humidity to an acceptable level, unburdening the cooling coil from the dehumidification task. Silica-gel is a form of silicon dioxide derived from sodium silicate and sulfuric acid, which has good affinity to water vapor and an adsorbing capacity of as much as 40% of its own weight. It can be manufactured as a substrate, and applied as a coating to a cylindrical drum, fitted with a micro-channel mesh. This equipment is often referred to as a desiccant wheel. The air dehumidification can be passive or thermally activated, as explained in the next section.",

The outside air stream is forced through the wheel, flowing through the micro-channels as it exchanges heat and mass with the desiccant coated walls. Since the objective is to recover enthalpy, the outside air stream is expected to simultaneously transfer heat and mass to the desiccant material. On the other side, when the room exhaust stream is forced through the wheel, it cools and dries the desiccant coated walls, dumping the heat and mass back to the atmosphere. As enthalpy is to be recovered, is expected some enthalpy storage within the desiccant material during the adsorptive period, which should exactly match the enthalpy deficit during the desorptive period, in steady state operation. Accordingly, the outside air stream is not expected to undergo an isenthalpic process when submitted to passive desiccant dehumidification. In fact, it is expected that the outside air stream will experience an enthalpy decrease between the wheel inlet and outlet, as depicted by the dashed line in Fig. 3\n.",

This can be explained by observing that desorption, which is an endothermic process, is promoted by the low temperature room exhaust stream. In a similar way, at the opposite process, the outside air stream cooling occurs simultaneously to the adsorption. Accordingly, the cooling process is rather ineffective, since adsorption is an exothermic process. It can be concluded that the heat and the mass transfers play off-setting roles from the enthalpy recovery viewpoint. Heat and mass are expected to have the same direction of migration, from the air to the desiccant felt during adsorption, with this direction being reversed during desorption.

When compared to passive wheels, active desiccant wheels contain a greater weight of silica-gel, or even uses a different desiccant material, with stronger affinity to water vapor. A high temperature regeneration stream provides the sensible energy required to purge the humidity from the solid, allowing for a thorough dehumidification. During desorption, heat is transferred from and mass is transferred to the air stream, whereas during adsorption these directions are reversed. As a result, an isenthalpic process is expected when air is submitted to active desiccant dehumidification, such as depicted by the continuous line in Fig. 3. Since the efficiency as described by Eq.

Cases (1)\u2013(3) have increasing temperatures and decreasing humidities for the room exhaust stream, in such a way that the enthalpy is kept constant. The outside air stream condition is kept constant in all situations. Referring to Fig. 2(a), cases (1)\u2013(3) in Table 1 correspond to different room exhaust conditions (EXHin), whereas state OAin corresponds to the condition of outside air. The processes undergone by the outside air ventilation stream are shown in Fig. 4\n. All results show that the outside air stream enthalpy is significantly reduced, as it would be expected from an enthalpy recovery technique. The deviation from the isenthalpic behavior is indeed a measure of the enthalpy recovery efficiency. Moreover, the enthalpy recovery for cases (1)\u2013(3) is the same, even though they represent different wheel inlet values for the room exhaust stream humidity and temperature. The physical reasoning behind this result is the aforementioned offsetting roles played by heat and mass transfers during the enthalpy recovery. The same behavior is observed, that is, all the cases exhibit the same value for the enthalpy at the outside air stream outlet. In addition, it can be inferred by observing (Fig. 4) that the enthalpy recovery capacity is limited. Comparing the outlet states from (1) to (3), it is apparent that a greater humidity reduction (i.e. latent energy recovery) is associated to a less significant temperature drop (i.e., sensible energy recovery). Accordingly, the greater is the humidity reduction, the lesser will be the temperature drop of the outside air stream across the desiccant wheel. Moreover, it should be observed that adsorption is an exothermic process, and the released heat hinders the airstream cooling. This result represents an opportunity for combining desiccants with a phase change material, which could act as a heat sink which absorbs the released heat of adsorption, allowing for a more significant sensible energy recovery [25], [26]. This ideal process would be represented by the dashed line in Fig. 4, leading to state OApc.",

The temperature T\nOAout and the humidity Y\nOAout are then recovered from the potentials F\n1,OAout and F\n2,OAout, which form a system of non-linear algebraic equations.(20)F1,i=\u22122865(Ti+273.15)1.49+4.344wi10000.8624\n(21)F1,i=(Ti+273.15)1.496360\u22121.127wi10000.07969\n(22)\u03b7F1=F1,OAout\u2212F1,OAinF1,EXHin\u2212F1,OAin\n(23)\u03b7F2=F2,OAout\u2212F2,OAinF2,EXHin\u2212F2,OAin\n",

For passive dehumidification, it was concluded that heat and mass transfer have conflicting influences over the enthalpy recovery, making the enthalpy recovery effectiveness oblivious to the atmospheric conditions. Accordingly, an increase in the outside air temperature will imply in a greater contribution of the sensible energy to the total enthalpy recovery, at the expense of a lesser contribution of the latent energy. Conversely, an increase in the outside air humidity will reverse this scenario, imposing a greater importance of the latent energy contribution. In any case, the enthalpy recovery effectiveness is properly described by Eq. [17].",
