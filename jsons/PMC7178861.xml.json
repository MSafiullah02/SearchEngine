Ecthyma commonly manifests as less than 10 lesions that remain fixed in size or progressively enlarge to 0.5\u20133 cm in diameter. Lesions are painful and may have associated regional lymphadenopathy, even with solitary lesions. Ecthyma usually arises on the lower extremities, most commonly on the ankle and dorsum of the foot. Ecthyma can resolve without treatment, but heals slowly, taking several weeks, and generally producing a scar [42\u201344].",

Other initial symptoms may be present: flu-like, fever, chills, muscle aches, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, confusion, vomiting, and diarrhea. Skin manifestations are rarer than in Staphylococcal TSS, but a generalized blanching and macular erythema may be present. A macular erythematous eruption commences on the trunk and spreads centripetally (see Fig. 13). Contrary to SSSS, the palms, soles, and mucous membranes develop erythema. Non-pitting edema of the palms, soles, and occasionally throughout the body occurs. This condition can rapidly progress to severe and intractable hypotension with multisystem dysfunction. When fever is persistent, hypotension and shock may develop and lead to multiorgan failure, myositis, fasciitis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). If the patient recovers, desquamation can occur 1\u20132 weeks after the onset of the illness in 20% of patients, affecting predominantly the palms and soles [61, 67, 68]. Nail and hair shedding may also occur [61, 62, 69].\n",

The severity of the infection can be explained by the versatility of C. perfringens\u2019 \u03b1 (alpha) toxin, which causes tissue necrosis, leukocyte inactivation, red blood cell hemolysis, and direct depression of the cardio-respiratory system. Leukocyte inactivation prevents host response thus predisposes the patient to a fulminant course.

As in non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis, patients with NF type I predominantly suffer from a predisposing systemic illness, such as diabetes. NF type II, as mentioned above, is an infection caused by virulent group A streptococci. Factors predisposing to NF type II include varicella lesions, a blunt or lacerating trauma, surgical procedure, exposure to a streptococcal-infected person, and some claim that NSAID use also predispose to NF type II by attenuating the host immune response [75, 77, 81, 82]. In contrast to NF type I, which is generally associated with a systemic illness, NF type II occurs in healthy patients of any age [82].

Patients do not complain of pain, but rather an occasional burning sensation.

In early disseminated disease, if the patient has isolated facial palsy, oral doxycycline for 14\u201321 days is enough [107]. However, if early, disseminated stage is manifested by carditis, AV block, meningitis or any other acute neurologic involvement, parenteral treatment with ceftriaxone or penicillin G for 10\u201328 days is necessary [113]. Patients with late disease manifested by arthritis alone may be treated with oral doxycycline therapy, but if neurologic findings with or without arthritis are present, parenteral ceftriaxone or penicillin therapy for 14\u201328 days is recommended [113]. Antibiotic prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients who have suffered a tick bite is very controversial. Currently, a single dose of doxycycline antibiotic is used as prophylaxis in patients who meet all of the following criteria:\nThe tick has been attached \u226536 hThe patient is within 72 h of tick removalThe tick has been identified as Ixodes scapularis\nThe bite occurred in an endemic area, andDoxycycline is not contraindicated [113, 114]\n",

Meanwhile, the WHO classification divides the gamut into three groups based on the number of cutaneous lesions: single-lesion leprosy (one skin lesion), paucibacillary leprosy (2\u20135 skin lesions), and multibacillary leprosy (>5 skin lesions). The Ridley\u2013Jopling classification is more commonly used with revisions adding an Indeterminate (I) \u00adcategory for patients in an early stage of the disease with insufficient clinical or histological features to fulfill a definitive category. In general, Hansen\u2019s disease primarily involves the skin and nervous system. In addition to cutaneous changes in pigmentation with possible anesthesia of the lesions, peripheral nerves can become enlarged and palpable [115]. Table 7 contains a brief description of each category [115, 120] (Figs. 16\u201321).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At the present time, diagnosis is based on clinical criteria plus skin smears or biopsy since it is known that multibacillary leprosy may not present with sensory loss and paucibacillary leprosy may be negative in skin smears [118].
