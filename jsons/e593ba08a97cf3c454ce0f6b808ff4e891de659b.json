This negative effect is growing with the high spreading rate of the virus. The most critical step to prevent the spreading of the virus is pre-screening and early diagnosis of the individuals. This results in quaranteeing the patients not to effect the healthy population. COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It has a high infection rate and it is urgent to diagnose many patients as we can to prevent the spread of the virus at the early stage. Rapid diagnostic tools development is urgent to save lives. MantisCOVID is a cloud-based pre-diagnosis tool to be accessed from the internet. This tool delivers a rapid screening test by analyzing the X-ray Chest Radiograph scans via Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it also evaluates the mortality rate of patients with the synthesis of the patient's history with the machine learning methods. This study reveals the methods used over the platform and evaluation of the algorithms via open datasets.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered novel coronavirus. This new virus and the caused disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic (WHO announced at March 12) affecting many countries globally [1] . COVID-19 can appear with many symptoms such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia (muscle ache), dyspnea(shortness of breath), expectoration (the coughing up and spitting out of material from the lungs, bronchi, and trachea, sputum), pharyngalgia, diarrhea (loose, watery stools),nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. Respiratory system symptoms are more common, and onset of disease pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [2] [16] . For the diagnosis, researchers define gold standard and lateral methods to overwhelm the pandemic via early diagnosis, but they have disadvantages such as high duration for RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), low sensitivity for antigen/antibody tests, high radiation exposure for Computer Tomography (CT). Since these methods have many disadvantages, a rapid diagnosis pre-screening test is crucial to keep the population well-being. Physicians' labor is the most important factor to fight with the novel coronavirus. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) which are improved with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods are timesaving activities for the physicians. A rapid analysis for the Chest X-ray (CXR) scans, CT, Infection Rate or Mortality Rate with the machine learning methods are some of the helpful tools and researchers are trying to build such tools for pre-screening COVID-19. This study defines a deployed environment 1 for rapid evaluation of the mortality rate and CXR scans via machine learning tools. The analysis explained in this study is the submitted work for the #EuvsVirus Hackathon 2 . The article goes as follows: Sec. 2 discusses about the diagnosis methods and their disadvantages. Sec. 3 reveals the algorithms in detail. Sec. 4 is the evaluation of each algorithm deployed over the platform and Sec. 5 concludes the work.",

Sensitivity of testing depends on the precise of RT-PCR assay, type of specimen, duration of illness at testing. In a study at China, 1070 samples collected from 205 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the most positive results 14 of 15 patients (93 percent). Specimens from upper respiratory tract had fewer positive results. From 326 pharyngeal swabs there were 136 positive results (32 percent) and from 8 nasal swabs there were 5 positive results (63 percent). Researchers in this study suggest that testing specimens from multiple sides may improve the sensitivity [4] .

According to a study in Wuhan, China with 1014 patient's chest CT has 97 percent sensitivity based on positive RT-PCR results. Researchers suggest that chest CT could be a primary tool to diagnose COVID-19. Unfortunately, specificity was 25 percent in other words 75 of 100 patients were false positive [5] . CT scan on pediatric patients should also be avoided due to radiation [6] . Besides that, the problem is that resources to diagnose are not sufficient. In the literature, machine learning methods are also applied for the diagnosis through CT images [18] [19] and they are used for supporting the clinician's decisions. However, they can not be applied in large number of samples to exploit the speed of AI interpretation. Therefore, lateral and rapid diagnostic tools are required for pre-elimination steps.",

In order to diagnose the pneumonia, CXR appears to be a useful tool and to diagnose the community acquired pneumonia. In fact, it is a gold standard with clinical evaluation and microbiologic test results [7] . Unfortunately, for COVID-19 CXR has some limitations. In a study on 64 patients some patients had no abnormality in their CXR even they had positive initial RT-PCR. CXR may be normal in early or mild disease [8] , but this test can be used more frequently due to low radiation exposure. The health systems of the governments also have enough x-ray scan devices to satisfy the population. In spite of that CXR is a low-cost diagnostic tool and in healthcare chest x-rays are used frequently and we should keep in mind that that study has limitations as researchers stated. That inspires second part of our solution. Some researchers also publish their AI architectures according to the detection of COVID-19 patients [20] [21] . By evaluating the fact that CXR is not enough to speak about certain diagnosis, a supporting parameter can be provided to the physician for the conditions where AI can not catch the condition. In this study, this parameter is defined as mortality rate that shows the risk of mortality for the person who is infected with COVID-19 disease.",

Inputs are accepted as 200x200 with Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colors which makes input shape 200x200x3. Max pooling layers and 2 hidden layers are inserted with 3x3 filter after convolution. Each hidden layer contains 32 convolutional filters with size 3x3 RELU activation functions with the addition of max-pooling layer with 2x2 filters. Then, flatten operation is applied. Fully connected layer is added with 64 units with RELU activation function. Later, dropout technique is applied with the rate of 0.5 to avoid overfitting. Finally, fully connected layer is used with a unit with sigmoid function (1, if the image is x-ray image; 0, otherwise). The classifier AI in the middle revealing whether the patient is risky (COVID-19 / pneumonia) or not is the trained model (modified version of AlexNet [11] ) according to the open datasets strengthened with the currently obtained COVID-19 patients' day by day [12] . The dataset is split into train (0.7), test (0.2) and validation (0.1) to enable the platform for the evaluation. It totally contains 8851 normal, 121 COVID-19 and 9579 pneumonia patient data [13] . The AI Architecture of the object classifier and training batch sizes are given in Fig. 3 . The last part defined as the object detection case is the detection of the lung opacity parts associated with the bacteria type pneumonia. The AI neural network is the trained tiny version of You Only Look Once (YOLO) [14] to mark the single objects in CXR PA images. The anomaly is named as lung opacity. The dataset used in this part is the annotated CXR PA obtained through the open source datasets [13] .",
