After their establishment as standard of care in many conditions such as rituximab in lymphoma, they have been progressively found to aid in the treatment of many other conditions. This area constituted a fertile area of research in the past 12 years (Zimmer et al. 2004). Physicians have investigated the B-cell depleting agents use in cases of autoimmune hematologic cytopenias such as ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), Evans syndrome, cold and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and other thrombophilic disorders such as the antiphospholipid syndrome and TTP (thrombocytopenic purpura).",

The disease has been witnessed to many changes all the way from understanding its pathophysiology to the evolution in its management options. Initially called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thus the acronym ITP, it went on to be named immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and more recently immune thrombocytopenia (Stasi et al. 1995). Changes in nomenclature emerged due to advances in understanding the disease. It was primarily thought of as a disease of peripheral platelet destruction of unknown origin. ITP\u2019s definition progressively evolved to include peripheral platelet destruction due to autoantibodies in addition to an inadequate production by megakaryocytes through disturbed level of erythropoietin (Neunert et al. 2011; Nugent et al. 2009). ITP is classified into primary and secondary. No test has been yet developed that can accurately pinpoint the diagnosis. The primary form is usually diagnosed by exclusion of a secondary form which is usually part of another disease process such as: antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, a hematologic or non-hematologic malignancy, common variable immune deficiency or might be due to hepatitis C or Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster or human immunodeficiency virus infection or to a vaccination side effect (Cines et al. 2009). Secondary ITP accounts for around 20 % of the total number of patients diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (Cines et al. 2009). Of relevance to this chapter is the primary form since this is where B-cell depleting agents come into play.",

Splenectomy is exclusively a second-line therapy however, should be delayed until 12 months after the diagnosis since patients might spontaneously remit within this period (Sailer et al. 2006).",

It has been proposed that a platelet count of 30 \u00d7 109 L\u22121 can be adopted as a threshold for treatment as it was shown to improve mortality in newly diagnosed ITP patients (Li et al. 2005; Neylon et al. 2003; Neunert et al. 2011). Glucocorticoids, IVIG, and anti-D have all been proposed as treatment options for ITP and are given alone or in combination based on the patients\u2019 tolerability of every treatment or the need for a quicker response in some cases (Nugent et al. 2009; Thota et al. 2012; Godeau et al. 1999; Newman et al. 2001; Zimmer et al. 2004). High dose dexamethasone has also been reported to be highly effective however, due to paucity of head to head studies with other treatments, it is not yet considered a standard of care (Cheng et al. 2003). Splenectomy, rituximab, and TPO agonists are all considered adequate second-line therapies (Provan et al. 2010; Arnold 2013; Neunert et al. 2011). Splenectomy is the option physicians have the most experience with not to mention the fact that it has the most studies to support it since it was the first and only second-line treatment option for a long time (Ghanima et al. 2012).",

            "text": "The first study exploring B depleting agents in ITP was reported in 2000. It was a retrospective one that included patients who had already been treated with steroids. It showed a 30 % response rate to rituximab when given at 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks (as per the lymphoma protocol) (Saleh et al. 2000). The first prospective trial using rituximab in ITP was reported in 2001 (Stasi et al. 2001). This study included 25 patients who had chronic ITP and had failed prior treatments. All of the patients received the 375 mg/m2 dose. The results from that trial showed an encouraging 52 % response rates in otherwise treatment refractory patients. With the minimal adverse event profile of this drug, it was found to be a safe alternative to more traditional treatments. A large systematic review exploring the efficacy of rituximab as a second-line treatment in patients older than 15 years of age with roughly half of them having undergone splenectomy found that treatment with rituximab gave a complete response rate (CR) of 46.3 % (95 % CI: 29.5\u201357.7) and a partial response rate (PR) of 24.0 % (95 % CI: 15.2\u201332.7). In that study PR and CR were defined as exceeding 50 \u00d7 109 cells/L and 150 \u00d7 109 cells/L, respectively (Arnold et al. 2007). This is different than the most recent ASH guidelines that define a CR as one that leads to a platelet count \u2265100 \u00d7 109 cells/L without bleeding and a response as one that leads platelet count \u226530 \u00d7 109 cells/L accompanied with a greater than twofold increase of platelet count from baseline with absence of bleeding (Neunert et al. 2011). The median time to response and response duration in the above-mentioned review were 5.5 weeks and 10.5 months, respectively. A recent meta-analysis confirmed rituximab\u2019s efficacy in ITP revealing an overall response and complete response of 59.7 and 45.7 %, respectively (Barcellini and Zanella 2011). Previous studies have shown that the response rate does not vary whether rituximab is used before or after splenectomy or used after a previous trial of rituximab (Auger et al. 2012). It has also been shown that the 100 mg/m2 dose can be as effective as the much higher ones used in the lymphoma protocol giving an overall response rate of 71 % (Stasi 2010). A recent systematic review recently published that included 18 observational studies with a total number 323 children with ITP concluded that CR for these patients was 39 % (CI: 30\u201349 %). The response rate was, however, 68 % (CI: 58\u201377 %). This is very similar to the response rates observed in adults; however, the definitions of CR (\u2265100 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and response (\u226530 \u00d7 109 cells/L) differed from their adult counterparts (Liang et al. 2012). A multicenter prospective trial of chronic ITP patients, who are candidates for splenectomy and were treated with rituximab, has shown promising results. At 1 year, 40 % of patients had responded (95 % CI: 28\u201352 %). This group, however, decreased over time with only 6.7 % of the patients experiencing sustained response after a single course of rituximab using the lymphoma protocol. This proved that rituximab could be used to delay or prevent splenectomy (Godeau et al. 2008) A recent large meta-analysis exploring rituximab as an option prior to splenectomy demonstrated a 57 % overall response rate after rituximab treatment with younger patients responding the most (Auger et al. 2012). Another study using rituximab earlier in the course of treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia evaluated 103 patients that were treatment na\u00efve. It consisted of randomizing patients to either dexamethasone alone or to dexamethasone with concomitant rituximab (lymphoma protocol). Results showed a significantly better sustained response by 27 % in patients receiving the steroid and rituximab regiment; 63 % versus 36 % in the steroid only arm. The occurrence of side effects nonetheless (grade 3 and 4) was much more pronounced however in the combined treatment group (Zaja et al. 2010). A newer trial demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the composite outcome of reaching a platelet count less than 50 \u00d7 109 cells/L, significant bleeding or need for rescue treatment, between a group of untreated ITP patients receiving their standard treatment and another receiving additional adjuvant rituximab (Arnold et al. 2012). One prohibitive factor in the use of rituximab has been the elevated cost. On average, a splenectomy would cost $20,000 whereas thrombopoietin and rituximab would each cost $2,500\u2013$4,500 per month, and $10,000\u2013$50,000, respectively (Ghanima et al. 2012).",

The first involves a decrease in macrophage phagocytosis and peripheral destruction of platelet coated with autoantibodies, when the latter are bound by rituximab. This would explain the early response (after 4 weeks) which occurs in the majority of cases after rituximab treatment. It is thought to be mediated by an inhibition of the Fc receptor portion of macrophages. The second mechanism involves B-cell depletion and accounts for the late response by decreasing the number of autoantibody producing B cells. The third mechanism is probably through T cell modulation effect of the drug since in some cases no correlation is observed between the disease severity and the antibody level (Stasi 2010).",

            "text": "Thrombotic cytopenic purpura is a rare hematological disease that has an estimated annual incidence of 11.3 cases/1,000,000 people. It has been classically defined as patients presenting with the pentad of thrombocytopenia, uremia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, and neurologic symptoms. This continues to be the classic teaching even though these symptoms are present all together in a minority of patients: 5 % of 64 patients from the Oklahoma registry of TTP patients (George 2010). Although TTP shares the same histological appearance with the hemolytic uremic syndrome, it is important to differentiate it from that latter since the management differs radically (Claus et al. 2010). It is considered to be an ancient disease that was first described as early as 1923 (Moschcowitz 2003). It has been proposed that it is due to aggregation of single von Willebrand factors units into a large multimer due to the absence of a metalloproteinase that usually breaks it down in order to keep the system in check (Galbusera et al. 1999). Later on, this metalloproteinase was discovered to be ADAMTS 13 (Zheng et al. 2001). The direct result of this abnormally large multimer is platelet aggregation, injury to RBCs, thrombosis, and subsequent end organ damage. ADAMTS 13\u2019s deficiency was considered the culprit of the disease up until recently when some TTP patients were discovered not to have a deficiency in this metalloproteinase (Kremer Hovinga et al. 2010; Vesely et al. 2003). TTP has been classified as either congenital or acquired. Patients having the congenital form of the disease (Upshaw\u2013Schulman Syndrome) constitute 5 % of people with TTP whereas the people with the acquired type make up the remaining 95 %. The acquired type is further subdivided into an autoimmune idiopathic subtype that makes up 70\u201380 % of those patients versus a secondary subtype that constitutes the rest (Rizzo et al. 2012). Some of the secondary causes that have been described are infections such as HIV, tumors, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and stem cell transplant recipients (Kremer Hovinga et al. 2010).",

Many studies later on observed the same effect of rituximab in treating refractory TTP patients in conjunction with plasmapheresis. A recent review reviewing six studies each of which included five or more patients reported clinical remission in 97 % from a total of 67 patients treated with rituximab given as per lymphoma protocol (Stasi 2010). This result should be interpreted with caution, since due to the rarity of the disease, many of the studies included represented small case series with no adequate controls (Sallah et al. 2004; Reddy et al. 2005; Heidel et al. 2007; Ling et al. 2009). Another review that included 118 patients with either refractory of relapsing TTP treated with rituximab came to a conclusion that 85 % of patients achieved remission and considered rituximab to be a safe and efficient treatment option in this subset of patients (Caramazza et al. 2010). Rituximab has also been shown to be a good first-line treatment in conjunction with plasma exchange. It has been shown to decrease hospital stay by a mean of 7 days in non-ICU admitted patients. Moreover, it markedly decreased relapse to 10 % versus 56 % in controls (Scully et al. 2011). Rituximab has successfully been used as a preemptive maintenance therapy in patients with recurrent disease and has also been shown to be equally effective in patients with long-standing and recently diagnosed TTP (Herbei and Venugopal 2006; Stasi 2010).",

This poses a challenge to the treating physician especially when considering corticosteroids side effects on the long term owing to the chronicity of the disease. Research tackling second-line treatments has been scarce in this field and relied mostly on immunosuppressant such as danazol, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or splenectomy (Norton and Roberts 2006).

Moreover, recurrent thrombotic events can occur in up to 30 % of APS patients (Gharavi et al. 1999), and 2\u20133 % might experience bleeding complications (Pierangeli et al. 1996). The best treatment for these APS patients who are intolerant or resistant to long-term anticoagulation remains unclear. New pathogenic mechanisms in APS are under investigation by ongoing research, including aPL-induced activation of platelets, endothelial cells, monocytes, complement and coagulation cascade, leading to the discovery of potential targets and therapies for APS (Comarmond and Cacoub 2012). New data indicates a link between high titers of aPL antibodies and elevated circulating CD5+ B cells, suggesting that APS may be responsive to B cell targeted therapies (Youinou and Renaudineau 2004).",

Nonetheless, how these antibodies are produced and the exact mechanism by which they mediate thrombosis is not fully elucidated. aPLs comprise a heterogeneous family of autoantibodies; yet, similar HLA class alleles are identified to be consistent with APS patients, namely HLA-DR4, -DR7, and -DRw53 (Doring et al. 2010). aPL antibodies bind to their target cells (i.e., monocytes, platelets, endothelial cells, and trophoblasts) through a mediator plasma apolipoprotein called \u03b22GPI, the main autoantigen for aPL antibodies. Consequently, up-regulation of tissue factor expression on monocytes and endothelial cells takes place leading to thrombosis and fetal loss through a series of signal transduction events (Romay-Penabad et al. 2007). Since aPLs play a central role in the pathogenesis of APS, special interest has been put on B cells, as they are the source of these pathogenic autoantibodies. Over the past 10 years, the role of autoreactive B cells in APS and the breakdown of B-cell tolerance have been extensively studied (Rand et al. 2008; Edwards et al. 1997). In addition to antibody production, B cells have other pathogenic mechanisms in APS, such as modifying their B-cell receptor specificity and acting as antigen presenting cells for self-antigens; besides differentiating into B effector cells (Be-1 and Be-2) which regulate helper T cells and their functions (Wallace 1994; Khattri et al. 2012).",

No randomized clinical trials were retrieved. Rituximab is a chimeric (murine/human) monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 on peripheral B cells, depleting them from the circulation and consequently decreasing disease activity (Willems et al. 2006; Youinou et al. 2009). Rituximab is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (Higashida et al. 2005) and recently for anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (Cohen Tervaert 2011). In addition to these indications, rituximab is being used as off-label treatment in a number of inflammatory and systemic autoimmune diseases (Butterly et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Rituximab was used in the treatment of 27 reported cases of APS (primary, secondary, and APS with concomitant malignancies), including 18 females and 9 male patients, whose age ranged from 3 months to 69 years (Khattri et al. 2012). Of the 27 APS patients, four suffered from concomitant lymphomas; two had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma for which rituximab was administered as part of the R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen (Veneri et al. 2005; Erre et al. 2008), and two received rituximab for marginal zone lymphoma (Manner et al. 2008; Harner et al. 2004), one of which had Sjogren\u2019s syndrome also (Harner et al. 2004). Five patients had SLE with secondary APS, where rituximab was used after failure of treatment with anticoagulation and/or immunosuppression for lupus (Cianciulli et al. 2008; Weide et al. 2003; Tomietto et al. 2004; Ahn et al. 2005; Anandacoomarasamy et al. 2006). One patient had Evans syndrome (Ruckert et al. 2008). The rest of the patients had primary APS (Iglesias-Jimenez et al. 2010; Nageswara Rao et al. 2009; Tsagalis et al. 2010; Adamson et al. 2008; van Wissen et al. 2008; Chalam et al. 2007; Ames et al. 2007; Rubenstein et al. 2006; Trappe et al. 2006; Binstadt et al. 2003; Erdozain et al. 2004; Asherson et al. 2008; Sciascia et al. 2011). Table 2 summarizes the clinical and serological manifestations of the reported APS patients along with their outcomes after treatment with rituximab (Khattri et al. 2012). The rituximab dosing regimen used in the majority of the cases was 375 mg/m2 body surface area, given weekly for 4 weeks. Four patients received rituximab 1,000 mg given 15 days apart. The reported patients were not treatment na\u00efve prior to rituximab administration; most received anticoagulation unless otherwise contraindicated, eight patients were treated with cyclophosphamide earlier (Ahn et al. 2005; Anandacoomarasamy et al. 2006; Iglesias-Jimenez et al. 2010; Ames et al. 2007; Rubenstein et al. 2006; Binstadt et al. 2003; Asherson et al. 2008), and all but one case (Tsagalis et al. 2010) used corticosteroids. The treatment regimen contained other immunosuppressants too, including azathiprine, mycophenolate mofetil, dapsone, and cyclosporine (Khattri et al. 2012). Improvement in the serological markers of APS was noticed in the majority of the cases, where decrease or normalization of LA, aCL, and anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies was seen. Furthermore, multiple systemic clinical manifestations associated with APS improved after starting rituximab regardless whether the patient suffered from primary or secondary APS. There was a uniformly good response to rituximab in primary APS and in APS associated with SLE (Weide et al. 2003; Cianciulli et al. 2008; Tomietto et al. 2004; Ahn et al. 2005; Anandacoomarasamy et al. 2006; Ruckert et al. 2008; Tsagalis et al. 2010; Adamson et al. 2008; Chalam et al. 2007; Ames et al. 2007; Rubenstein et al. 2006; Trappe et al. 2006; Binstadt et al. 2003; Erdozain et al. 2004; Sciascia et al. 2011; Vianna et al. 1994; Danowski et al. 2009) or lymphoma (Erre et al. 2008; Veneri et al. 2005; Manner et al. 2008; Harner et al. 2004) in the case reports reviewed. Moreover, six out of seven CAPS patients benefited from rituximab treatment, knowing the severity and frequent fatality faced in this entity in spite of standard treatment with anticoagulants and immunosuppressant agents (Manner et al. 2008; Iglesias-Jimenez et al. 2010; Nageswara Rao et al. 2009; van Wissen et al. 2008; Rubenstein et al. 2006; Asherson et al. 2008).\n",

Moreover, the above-mentioned published case reports have several limitations including their small number, besides the fact that in all the cases, other immunosuppressants were used including steroids and cyclophosphamide, which creates confusion on whether it was rituximab-induced B-cell depletion by itself or the combination of immunosuppressants used that caused improvement in APS patients. Also, it is worth mentioning that the treated population was diverse including patients with primary or secondary APS or malignancy (Khattri et al. 2012). Finally, in a pilot open-label phase II trial aimed primarily to evaluate the safety of rituximab in aPL-positive patients with non-criteria manifestations of APS, and secondarily to evaluate the effect on the aPL profile and efficacy of treatment, it was suggested that rituximab may be effective in controlling some but not all non-criteria manifestations of APS with a safety profile in aPL-positive patients consistent with that of rituximab (Erkan et al. 2013).",

Data on the use of rituximab in the treatment of APS is limited to case reports, the BIOGEAS registry and a pilot open-label phase II trial, and suggests a beneficial role in the therapeutic approach of APS.

Consequently, the normal 100\u2013120 days lifetime of the RBCs is reduced to just a few days in serious cases (Sawitsky and Ozaeta 1970). AIHA can be idiopathic or secondary to infections, other autoimmune conditions or lymphoproliferative disorders, and depending on the thermal range of the autoantibodies involved, the disease can be classified into warm, cold (which includes cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) or mixed (Gehrs and Friedberg 2002). Whether warm- or cold- type secondary AIHA, each can result from its own more common secondary causes. For instance, secondary warm-type AIHA mostly results from lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma) and other autoimmune disorders, including SLE, RA, scleroderma, and ulcerative colitis. Less commonly, it can be caused by neoplasms other than lymphoid and infection. Similarly, secondary cold-type AIHA is primarily caused by lymphoproliferative disorders, but also occurs secondary to infection, especially by mycoplasma, viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and other respiratory infections, and infrequently due to concomitant autoimmune disorders (Sokol et al. 1981).",

Splenectomy is probably the most effective second-line treatment with a response rate of 50 %, especially in relapsing patients on corticosteroids or those requiring the equivalent of 10\u201315 mg prednisone per day to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. We have to bear in mind the surgical and infective complications, particularly gram-negative sepsis in patients above 65 (Gehrs and Friedberg 2002; Valent and Lechner 2008; Newland et al. 2005). Moreover, patients who are unresponsive to or do not fit for splenectomy, have limited options including cytotoxic or immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine, with a response rate of 40\u201360 % and associated side effects (52). On the other hand, cold-type AIHA has failed to demonstrate a convincing response to standard therapy, particularly cold hemaglutinin disease (Barcellini and Zanella 2011).",

            "text": "In a recent review carried by Garvey et al. collecting data from studies using rituximab in the treatment of AIHA, rituximab (375 mg/m2 given weekly for 4 weeks) was found to be effective in treating both warm AIHA and cold hemaglutinin disease, with a median response rate of 60 % and lasting responses for more than 3 years (Garvey 2008). Furthermore, in three more recent studies (Dierickx et al. 2009; Bussone et al. 2009; Penalver et al. 2010), the response rate was higher and ranged from 77 to 93 % with a disease-free survival at 1 and 2 years in 72 and 56 % of cases, respectively (Dierickx et al. 2009). In several case series, rituximab has been shown to be effective in both patient groups with idiopathic and secondary AIHA, even in those associated with autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, and bone marrow transplant (Shanafelt et al. 2003; Penalver et al. 2010; Quartier et al. 2001; Zecca et al. 2003; Narat et al. 2005; Berentsen et al. 2006; Schollkopf et al. 2006; D\u2019Arena et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2002; Trape et al. 2003; D\u2019Arena et al. 2006). Moreover, rituximab proved to be effective whether used as a monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and interferon (Zecca et al. 2003; Narat et al. 2005; Berentsen et al. 2006; D\u2019Arena et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2002), and irrespective or prior therapy (Penalver et al. 2010; Shanafelt et al. 2003; Quartier et al. 2001; Zecca et al. 2003; Narat et al. 2005; Berentsen et al. 2006; Schollkopf et al. 2006; Gupta et al. 2002; Trape et al. 2003; D\u2019Arena et al. 2006). Time to maximum response varied between the studies from quick response to weeks or even months, where in two recent studies, the median time to response was 3 and 6 weeks, respectively (Bussone et al. 2009; Penalver et al. 2010). It is noteworthy that re-treatment with rituximab is effective with both warm AIHA and cold hemaglutinin disease (Rao et al. 2008; Zecca et al. 2003; Berentsen et al. 2006; Gupta et al. 2002), with re-treatment benefiting some patients more than once (Zecca et al. 2003; Berentsen et al. 2006; Penalver et al. 2010). When comparing rituximab to the next best therapeutic regimen which includes alkylating agents with or without corticosteroids, rituximab was the only treatment able to induce a complete response in cold hemaglutinin disease with a response of 60 % (10 % complete response and 50 % partial response), compared with 16 % (all partial responses) (Berentsen et al. 2006; Berentsen et al. 2004; Barcellini and Zanella 2011). Regarding rituximab safety when given to patients with AIHA, the drug was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported in most cases, besides mild to moderate infusion-related side effects (e.g., fever, chills, hypotension, and upper airway edema) (Rao et al. 2008; Zecca et al. 2003; Schollkopf et al. 2006; Gupta et al. 2002; Trape et al. 2003). Some patients (around 7 %) experienced possible rituximab-related infections (Quartier et al. 2001; Zecca et al. 2003; Narat et al. 2005; Trape et al. 2003; Schollkopf et al. 2006), and few (roughly 2 %) had grade 4 neutropenia (Berentsen et al. 2006; Gupta et al. 2002). Moreover, low dose rituximab (100 mg \u00d7 4 weeks) was tried in patients unresponsive to standard therapy in an attempt to reduce side effects and costs, and it was found effective as a monotherapy (Provan et al. 2007) and in combination with alemtuzumab (Gomez-Almaguer et al. 2010). In a study conducted by Barcellini et al, low dose rituximab along with standard oral prednisone was able to induce an overall response rate of 86 % (complete 67 % and partial 19 %) in 21 patients with warm and cold AIHA; response was sustained (Hb >10 g/dl) in 13/14 patients at 6 months and in 11/11 evaluable patients at 1 year (BARCELLINI et al. 2010).",
