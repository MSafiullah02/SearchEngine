Within 24 hours, COVID-19-related hashtags accompanied #CardioTwitter in 124 of 560 (22%) tweets reaching over 600,000 individuals ( Figure   1 ). These were exemplified in health care professionals correcting preliminary and false assumptions online in the treatment of COVID-19, which included (1) the improper cessation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors, angiotensinreceptor-blockers, and low-dose acetylsalicylic-acid in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, and; 2 (2) the ingestion of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin as treatment of COVID-19, which is not recommended without proper physician supervision due to the risk of QT prolongation. 3 Critical medical leadership is urgently required at all levels of our health systems. Now is the time for collaboration, rather than fragmentation, to provide the necessary care for our patients, whilst bettering our understanding of the complexities brought upon individuals' cardiovascular health due to COVID-19. We applaud the CCS and CJC for their efforts to promote cardiovascular physician engagement on social media and encourage all to join in to combat the infodemic of the era by using your voices as physicians to educate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) established a COVID-19 Rapid Response Team led by President Dr. Andrew Krahn, and swiftly put forward both evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations to guide management and prepare for the surge of COVID-19-positive cardiovascular patients. 4 In collaboration with Elsevier, and together with other leading cardiology and cardiac surgery journals, the Canadian Journal of Cardiology (CJC) lifted its paywall on COVID-19-related publications and instituted expedited peer-review of pertinent submissions to accelerate the generation and dissemination of groundbreaking research. In response to public demand, the CCS hosted a live-virtual townhall to provide practical advice to the cardiovascular community on how to implement their recommendations, address issues encountered, and offer potential solutions. In turn, on social media, medical professionals pool knowledge regarding COVID-19, propelopen-source hackathons to address shortages in necessary medical equipment (e.g., #BuildForCOVID19), raise awareness of challenges faced on the frontline (e.g., #GetMePPE), and empower the public to take charge of their own health (e.g., #StayHomeSaveLives).",
