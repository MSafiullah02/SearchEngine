The virus'sD 6 1 X X basic reproduction number (R0), an epidemiologic metric describing transmissibility in terms of the average number of cases that could be caused by 1D 6 2 X X infected patient in a susceptible population [15] , has been estimated asD 6 3 X X 1.4 to D 6 4 X X3.0 [16], compared withD 6 5 X X \u00bb1.2 to 3 for seasonal influenza R0D 6 6 X X, \u00bb12 to 17 for pertussis R0D 6 7 X X, and \u00bb12 to 18 for measles R0 D 6 8 X X [15, 17] .
