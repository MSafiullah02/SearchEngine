As such, the South African government has shown its commitment towards citizenry and the provision of effective service delivery. Social Media Analytics (SMA) has emerged as a potential new solution to support decision-making for service delivery in CzRM. It is believed that the demand for SMA adoption will increasingly rise. However, the reality of social media Big Data comes with the challenges of analysing it in a way that brings Big Value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the challenges of social media Big Data Analytics (BDA) and to incorporate these in a conceptual model that can be used by governments to support the e-participation of citizens. The model was developed through a systematic literature review (SLR). The findings revealed that data challenges relate to designing an optimal architecture for analysing data that caters for both historic data and real-time data at the same time.",

SMA has also the potential to use advanced techniques to analyse patterns in social media data to enable informed and insightful decision-making for Citizen Relationship Management (CzRM) [2, 3] . CzRM is the growing effort of governments around the world to strive to respond rapidly to their citizens by fostering a closer relationship with them, thereby creating more efficient service delivery and e-participation. e-Participation often empowers citizens through social media to act in bottom-up decision-making processes. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to the rise of e-participation, whereby governments adopt digital tools to promote citizen involvement in what is referred to as \"CzRM\" [4] . Recently, [5] argued that the potential of Big Data for digital tools is often not met since it presents a data set that is so large or complex that it is difficult to process and manage this data using traditional data processing and management applications. The effective and efficient storage and retrieval of vast amounts of structured as well as unstructured data, referred to as Big Data, remains a challenge [6] .",

Some of these advantages are improved service delivery, improved decision-making, transparency, an improved organisation image and more inclusive policy processes. However, [11, 12] report that governments lack valid and reliable measures for determining and analysing the effects of social media. Without these measures they remain unable to align their social media initiatives with organisational strategies and ultimately create business value. Several studies [13] [14] [15] indicate that the use of social media and ICTs in a government context increases collaboration amongst stakeholders, enabling feedback and promoting citizen e-participation.",

They also do not consider the data value chain or the challenges for addressing service delivery and citizen e-participation with social media. There is also a lack of related research in Africa. This gap was addressed by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) in order to design a conceptual model. The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of the research question and method adopted in the research. Section 3 reports on review findings: the data lifecycle and SMA challenges. Section 4 reports on discussions and implications for research in Africa. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides an agenda for future possible research.",

There are limited studies that focus on SMA for government and e-participation. A recent study of Big Data challenges proposed by [28] provided useful insight into the research problem and classified the challenges according to three categories of the data lifecycle.

            "text": "Privacy and Security -According to [37] , data security and privacy issues can be potentially exasperated by the volume, variety, and wide area deployment of the system infrastructure to support Big Data applications. Social networks are all around us and their popularity is vast. People share a lot of personal information in these networks without any concern for what the organisation behind these networks will do with their data, resulting in a huge threat to our personal privacy [40, 41, 43] . It is not an easy task to address this problem. One suggestion is for new redefined legislation to increase the protection of data privacy. Other have proposed a technique that can be used to increase the control that users have over their own data in social networks, whilst others have recommended distorting the data by adding noise.",

There is a dire need for additional research on the challenges and future research directions regarding analysing social media Big Data. The novelty of this paper lies in the design and use of a conceptual model for social media Big Data to inform the e-participation of citizens and decision making of management in government. Improved decision-making can assist in a smart city strategy for governments.
