We the authors are excited at the prospect of joining the profession and making a difference, as we agree the future of chiropractic looks bright. However, we are questioning the above sentiment in light of the current global crisis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The world is struggling to come to terms with COVID-19, chiropractic students are no exception. The delivery of education has changed, many campus clinics have closed, and future plans of graduating students have been placed in jeopardy. Despite these trying times, we appreciate and are encouraged by the initiative and collaborative spirit of the chiropractic profession. Chiropractic institutions have ensured the availability of quality education in an online format [2], associations have supported and advocated for their members [3], and researchers have appraised literature to assist with knowledge translation [4].",

We are proud of the institutions that have signed the International Chiropractic Education Collaboration Position Statement (ICECPS), clearly demonstrating their desire for an evidence-based approach to teaching and healthcare [13]. For us, it is disappointing that only two North American chiropractic programs have signed this position statement. At a time when scientifically unsupported claims are being made, we call for all chiropractic institutions to adopt the ICECPS position. We also believe the Councils on Chiropractic Education (CCE), who are the regulators and accreditors of chiropractic programs [14], need to participate in this effort. The CCE-International, which is recognized by the WHO as an information source, was established in 2003 to provide guidance to the CCEs [15]. Though the CCE-International supports an evidence-based musculoskeletal (MSK) model, this sentiment is not held by all CCEs [15, 16]. We are disappointed that some accredited schools continue to instruct non-evidence-based teachings [15\u201317]. Therefore, we urge all CCEs to take the necessary steps to ensure an evidence-based curriculum is universally adopted.",

As a result, significant reputational damage can follow when unfounded claims are made that undermine public health policy. Disappointingly, the increased media attention we have seen leads us to believe the damage has already begun. In a recent article published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) on March 30th, 2020, the claims made by some chiropractors regarding SMT and immunity were said to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d and add unnecessary confusion to the public [19]. Similar news stories have been written by Fox6 in the state of Wisconsin and CBC in British Columbia [20, 21]. As a result of this media attention, we are deeply worried for future ramifications if these claims continue. G\u00edslason states \u201congoing resistance to aligning with the scientific literature has been seen by some as the central issue in impeding professional legitimization, scientific and societal support and inclusion within the wider healthcare professional landscape\u201d [22]. We believe unsubstantiated claims made by a select few are generalized to the profession. This has cast a dark shadow on the profession in the eyes of critics and the healthcare community.",

However, research has shown that misinformation corrected by the original source has demonstrated greater success in rectifying the public message [25, 26]. Therefore, in order to mitigate some of the reputational damage, we call on all chiropractors and organizations spreading misinformation to retract their statements and issue corrections. As we realize this is unlikely, we call on regulators to issue retractions to unsubstantiated statements chiropractors have made, in addition to their normal punitive action.",

We agree with the views of Marcon et al., that \u201cit is hoped that the regulatory bodies will recognize these types of discourse [non-evidence-based claims] as problematic and will act accordingly\u201d [30]. Inaction by regulatory bodies can lead to public confusion and negatively impact the image of the profession. If disciplinary actions are not taken by regulatory bodies, public perception will continue to be that all chiropractors agree with the false claims made by a small, yet vocal minority. This inaction will result in the continual spread of these unfounded beliefs [31]. We are concerned for the profession that we will be entering, as the profession\u2019s reputation will be tarnished if swift action is not taken against these chiropractors. While we appreciate and support the regulatory bodies who have begun to take action against these dangerous claims, we call for further action and decisiveness. Similar to statements made by Leboeuf-Yde et al., we feel it is time for the profession to act before it is too late [31]. As students, we call not only on regulatory bodies to step up, but all stakeholders who have a vested interest in the profession to pursue their professional responsibility; reporting such behaviour in order to protect the public interest and assist with regulatory enforcement of the profession.",
