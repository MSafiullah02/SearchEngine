Although the NL63 infections occur frequently, the virus remained undetected until the usage of a new virus discovery strategy (VIDISCA), which led to its detection. The reason for this late detection despite the use of classical virus isolation techniques remains unclear. Difficulties to initiate an NL63-infection in the cell lines routinely used for diagnostics, or lack of CPE in these cells may be responsible. In order to address these questions with the aim of the development of a more sensitive diagnostic, we consequently tested several cell lines commonly used for routine diagnostic purposes for their ability to support coronavirus NL63 replication.",

In both cell lines an initial decrease in the number of genomes in the supernatant was observed that was most obvious for Vero-B4 cells inoculated with coronavirus NL63. The number of genomes increased from days 2 to 3 post inoculation and reached a plateau on day 4, resulting in equal kinetics. This observation confirmed and extended the earlier finding by Fouchier et al. (2004) and Kuiken et al.

Taking into account that these cell lines also displayed a CPE (see below) one may speculate that inoculation of MDCK cells, MS cells, and RD cells with coronavirus NL63 is toxic for these cell lines, probably due to the temporarily expression of viral genes of NL63 that was not earlier. However, it remains to be investigated whether there is indeed no intracellular genome amplification or whether these cell lines solely cannot excrete viral particles into the cell culture supernatant, both of which is possible in case of LLC-MK2 and Vero-B4 cells. Most interestingly, lung fibroblasts were not permissive for NL63 at all, suggesting that these cell lines have de-differentiated in cell culture. CPE were observed in all cell lines from days 4 to 5 (MDCK, MS, Vero-B4, LLC-MK2) or at days 5\u20136 (RD). This effect was virus-specific since negative control cells displayed no cytopathicity until day 6. The observed NL63-CPE was virtually indistinguishable from cytopathic effects caused by other viruses; thereby, from the morphological changes observed, the observed CPE resembles the CPE induced by picornaviruses. Infected cells became small and detached from the cell culture flask. Thereby, no plaque formation but a diffuse initiation of CPE formation was observed. Neither a CPE nor an increase in the number of genomes was observed for MRC-5 lung fibroblast.",

As LLC-MK2 and Vero are very common cells in diagnostic facilities, the original isolation of NL63 may thus have been an exceptional event and diagnostic culture on these cells may be very unrewarding.

By this algorhithm there would be no delay in the diagnosis, because in routine diagnostics time is often a critical issue, but additional information may be available after all procedure were finished. Although we have not compared the differences in the sensitivity of the combined PCR/culture/PCR protocol versus a PCR-only protocol, a number of earlier publications describing the identification of \u201cnew\u201d viruses clearly demonstrate that with respect to the spectrum of viruses the combined approach appears to be superior (e.g. van den Hoogen et al., 2001, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Fouchier et al., 2004).",
