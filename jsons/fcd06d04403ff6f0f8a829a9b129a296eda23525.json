            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells which elicit primary immune response upon antigen challenge [1] . It has been suggested that tumor cells produce specific factors which affect DC function. Indeed, it has been reported that many established tumor cell lines such as A549 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, IMR90 lung fibroblast, MCF-7 breast carcinoma, A427 lung adenocarcinoma, R11 renal cell carcinoma, and UCLA-SOM-M14 (M14) melanoma cell line, induce altered maturation of DC with enhanced T-cell stimulatory capacity [2] . To ask how tumor cells influence DC function, Chen and Chang [3] prepared conditioned media (CM) from six tumor cell lines and carefully examined their effects on DC morphology and function. Among the cell lines tested, they found that the supernatants from 293T embryonic kidney cell line and MDA-468 breast carcinoma cell line significantly enhanced maturation and allostimulatory activity of DCs. Further examination of these cell lines, however, revealed that the two tumor cell lines but not the others, were contaminated by mycoplasmas. The eradication of mycoplasmas from these two cell lines completely abolished the observed effects on DCs.",

These cells have clinical potential for repair or replacement of damaged tissues [4] . The clinical application of MSCs for tissue regeneration is best achieved with an allogeneic product (i.e. a large number of cells derived from one donor that could be used for multiple recipients). A potential limitation to this 'universal donor' concept is rejection of donor cells by the recipients' immune system. In this issue of Journal of Biomedical Science, Klyushnenkova et al. investigated immunological properties of human MSCs to assess their suitability for allogeneic transplantation. They found that MSCs do not induce T-cell proliferation, which they attributed to a suppressive mechanism, rather than lack of immunogenicity or induction of tolerance [5] .",

Results of present study demonstrated that treatment with the butanol fraction of B. pilosa ameliorated Th1 cell mediated autoimmune diabetes in mice with non-obese diabetes (NOD) but caused deterioration of TH2 cell-mediated airway inflammation induced by ovalbumin (OVD) in BALB/C mice. Meanwhile, results showed that TH2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) increased but TH1 cytokine, IFN-r, decreased following injections with the butanol fraction and B. pilosa in both mouse strains. In conclusion, the butanol fraction of B. pilosa has a dichotomous effect on helper T cell-mediated immune disorders, plausibly via modulation and T cell differentiation [14] .",

A cell line of rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6) was stimulated with transforming growth factor-b 1 (TGF-b 1) . The inhibitory effects of Sm (50-400 lg/ml) on TGF-b 1-induced a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) secretion and the mRNA expres-sion of fibrosis-related genes, including a-SMA, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), were assessed. Fibrosis was induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) administration in rats. Results demonstrated that hepatic collagen contents were also significantly reduced by either Sm or silymarin treatment. The mRNA expression levels of a-SMA, TGF-b1, and procollagen I were all attenuated in Sm-and silymarin-treated rats. Moreover, levels of plasma aspartate transaminase activities were reduced by Sm and silymarin treatment. In conclusion, results show that Sm exerted antifibrotic effects in both HSC-T6 cells and in rats with DMN-induced fibrosis [34] .",

Thus, the effect of N T -nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and N G -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) on the spatial distribution of diaphragmatic microvascular blood flow was measured after different periods at either a fixed site (Q stat ) or 25 different sites (Q scan ) using computer-aided laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) scanning. The value of Q stat was unaffected after 15-20 min superfusion with any one of the following agents: L-NOARG (0.1 mM), L-NMMA (0.1 mM), L-arg (10 mM). The cumulative frequency histogram of the Q scan value in the control group displayed a non-Gaussian distribution that was not significantly affected after 15 min superfusion with the vehicle of L-NOARG. Superfusion with either L-NMMA or L-NOARG at 0.1 mM for 15 min displaced the histogram of cumulative frequency to the left, with the median value of blood flow decreasing by 10% to 20%. However, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of basal Q scan were unaffected after superfusion of either of the L-arg analogues. Pretreatment with L-arg (10 mM), followed by coadministration of L-arg (10 mM) with L-NOARG (0.1 mM) only partially prevented L-NOARG from exerting this inhibitory effect on the distribution of basal Q scan , while pretreatment with Larg in the same manner could prevent L-NMMA from exerting its inhibitory effect. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate the presence of basal NO activity in diaphragmatic microvascular beds, and that the spatial inhomogeneity of microvascular blood flow is not dependent on NO [37] .",

The rhythm-related genes including rPer 1, rPer 2 and rClock exhibit strong expression throughout the SCN [39] , and rPer 1 and rPer 2 expression can be induced by acute light [40] . These findings suggest that circadian rhythms can be regulated by different signals from different subdivision of the SCN. Shieh et al. [41] studied the expression of rhythm-related genes in different brain regions of rats, and found that the expression patterns of mRNA for rPer 1 and rPer 2 were not similar in these brain regions. Moreover, diurnal changes in rClock mRNA expression were not detected in any brain regions examined. These findings suggest that the different expression patterns observed for rPer 1, rPer 2 and rClock may be attributed to their different physiological role in these brain regions.",

In the present study [43] , we have applied modified comet assay and bacterial repair endonuclease system to investigate H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in K562 and MCF-7 cells and to explore whether JWA, a cell differentiation associated gene, is involved in the event. The results have shown that the average tail length and the percentage of the cells with DNA tails are greatly induced by H 2 O 2 treatment and further significantly enhanced by the post-treatment of repair endonucleases. In addition, the data have clearly demonstrated that JWA gene expression is actively induced by H 2 O 2 treatment in these cells, suggesting that JWA is actively involved in the signal pathways of oxidative stress in the cells.",
