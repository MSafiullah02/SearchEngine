TMEV is a common cause of asymptomatic enteric infections in mice housed in non-barrier animal colonies (Brownstein et al., 1989). In addition, TMEV spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) to cause poliomyelitis (flaccid paralysis) and more rarely, encephalitis (Thompson et al., 1951). TMEV is divided into two subgroups based on neuro-virulence in mice after intra-cerebral inoculation. The first subgroup consists of highly neuro-virulent strains represented by GDVII and FA that cause acute and fatal encephalitis. The second subgroup comprises less virulent strains, such as BeAn and DA, that produce a persistent infection in the CNS of mice that results in mononuclear cell inflammation and demyelination (Lehrich et al., 1976, Lipton, 1975). This demyelinating disease has immune parameters and histopathology similar to those of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and thus is extensively studied as an infectious model for MS.",

The first report of a TMEV-like pathogen infecting rats occurred in 1964 when a small group of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were identified with central nervous system deficits and histopathologic lesions that resembled those of mice infected with TMEV (McConnell et al., 1964). The original isolate, known as MHG, was reported to cause paralysis in suckling rats and mice following intracranial inoculation. It was further recognized that subclinically infected rats developed serum antibodies that cross-reacted with TMEV antigens (Hemelt et al., 1974). The seroprevalence data indicate RTV is one of the most prevalent viral pathogens infecting research rat colonies (Drake et al., 2008, Dyson, 2010, Livingston and Riley, 2003, Ohsawa et al., 2003, Rodrigues et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Since cardioviruses infection poses a greater epizootic threat for colony-bred mice and rats used in biomedical research, rapid diagnosis is essential to prevent transmission of infection throughout a research animal facility. Viral diagnosis is based commonly on antigen or antibody detection. Serologic methods such as multiplexed fluorescence immuneassay (MFIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) has typically been used to diagnose TMEV and RTV infections in rodents (Drake et al., 2011, Khan et al., 2005, Laborde et al., 2008, Lipton et al., 2001, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009). However, serologic assays cannot detect TMEV and RTV infections directly in immunodeficient strains of rodents that do not generate a humoral immune response, and the time required for host seroconversion in immunocompetent rodents may prevent rapid definitive diagnosis by serologic testing during an epizootic. Serologic assays also do not give information if an agent is still present in an animal and if it is still infective. In addition, serologic assays to detect antibodies to RTV in rats have historically used mouse TMEV strains as antigens, exploiting the antigenic cross-reactivity of these viruses with RTV (Easterbrook et al., 2008, Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009). Therefore, the two groups of viruses may not be distinguishable. For the detection of contamination in biological materials, the mouse/rat antibody production (M/RAP) test is still applied occasionally, although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have been developed (Bootz et al., 2003). This test requires the use of animals, is time consuming and expensive.",

The DNAs obtained were gel-purified, quantified by spectrophotometry and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use.

Virus-derived DNA inserts were revealed by conventional PCR using specific primers (as above), the identity and integrity of the positive plasmids had been verified by sequencing. The homogeneity of the plasmid preparations was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Since cardioviruses are easily spread by the fecal-oral route, and viruses are characterized by resistance to inactivation, periodic reintroduction, and relatively long shedding periods. Elimination of these viruses from research facilities requires improved detection. The diagnosis of TMEV or RTV in clinical as well as symptomless infections depends upon positive serology, M/RAP, or RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA. This study describes the development of a new duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of TMEV and RTV using differently labeled Taqman probes for each virus. The primer/probe combinations were highly specific, and no cross-reaction was detected by using seven other viral pathogens of rodent. Meanwhile, the cecum content and spleen samples collected from ten SPF mouse and rat strains were also negative by the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. This clearly demonstrates that the TMEV and RTV primer/probe combinations are specific to their specified virus.",

In this study, the in vitro-transcribed RNA containing the partial gene of the TMEV and RTV virus were used to determine the sensitivity of duplex real-time RT-PCR. By using different concentrations of primers, probes, and other reagents, reaction temperatures and times, the conditions of the duplex real-time RT-PCR were optimized (data not shown). The duplex assay was sensitive enough to detect and quantify a very low copy number without mutual interference; the limits of detection of both TMEV and RTV were 4 \u00d7 101 copies RNA/reaction. The sensitivity of this duplex assay is equivalent to that of the simplex assay. Nevertheless, duplex PCR takes the same amount of time and effort but produces more data. The system was also specific and sensitive even in the presence of large amounts of another viral RNA. The low mean CV of the duplex real-time RT-PCR indicated that this assay was able to generate reproducible results.",

            "text": "Furthermore, clinical samples collected from four different sources were simultaneously evaluated using the duplex real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. The results showed that the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive and effective than conventional RT-PCR in the examination of 439 clinical samples, where 18 samples and 6 samples were negative by conventional RT-PCR, respectively, but they were positive by the duplex real-time RT-PCR. The TMEV and RTV positive rate of clinical samples obtained from barrier colony-raised mice or rats was 11.1% (27/244) and 5.8% (3/52), respectively, which is much higher than the rate of 0.26\u20131.43% reported in North America and Europe (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009), indicating that cardioviruses had a high prevalence in China in the past 3 years. The positive rate of non-barrier colony and wild colony was higher than that of barrier colony. In additional, mixed infection of TMEV and RTV was detected in non-barrier raised laboratory rodent and wild rats. As wild mice and rats are the natural host of cardioviruses (Lipton et al., 2001, Ohsawa et al., 2003, Rodrigues et al., 2005), it is necessary to prevent introduction of non-barrier colony raised or feral mice and rats, or contaminated bedding from an outside source, into a clean (barrier conditions) laboratory rodent colony. Thus, strict adherence to standard biological containment measures and barrier conditions is advisable.",
