Recently, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are utilized widely in order to achieve these targets. In this research, an efficient method for image description is proposed which is developed by Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. This method is created using combination of an improved AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors. Furthermore, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm has been used for dimension reduction. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the offered method compared to existing methods by improving the accuracy, mean Average Precision (mAP) and decreasing the complex computation. The experiments have been run on Corel-1000, OT and FP datasets.

In computer vision, image descriptors describe elementary characteristics such as shape, color, texture or motion of images, which are visual features of images (Kumar and Sreekumar 2014; Nair and Jacob 2017). Offering new image descriptors has been active research area and will help in increasing the performance of many tasks in computer vision. Some descriptors such as HOG, LBP, SURF and SIFT have been proposed, so far (Lowe 2004 ; Dalal . Each of these descriptors has disadvantages, like large dimension of feature vector and considering only certain features such as texture. To overcome these problems, an efficient image descriptor is presented in this research. This descriptor is created using combination of HOG, LBP and improved AlexNet CNN. Furthermore, for dimension reduction the PCA has been applied. When the proposed descriptor is used for image classification and CBIR, it provides benefits which are divided into following items:",

Some researchers utilized combination of descriptors to propose new ones in order to increase efficiency and use it for special cases (Huang et al 2015). Some of them are described as follow: (Wang et al 2009) has offered a descriptor using combination of HOG and LBP. The results of this approach have showed that, it is an efficient descriptor for object detection, but the unequal dimension is the main problem of that. This descriptor is affected by HOG. Convolutional Neural Networks can be used for feature extraction, and the extracted features are utilized in cases such as classification, retrieval or detection. (Lu et al 2017) proposed a method in which the fusion of extracted features by two networks used for face detection. In some works the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and descriptors is used to create a new image descriptor. For instance, (Madan et al 2019) has suggested a method that image features are extracted using the HOG and SURF descriptors, then the features of each descriptor are sent to convolutional layers, and the feature vectors with 1 \u00d7 2016 and 1 \u00d7 1024 dimensions are created. After that, these features are combined and their dimension is reduced by Fully Connected (FC) layers and eventually are used for classification. In this way, such as (Wang et al 2009; Jani et al 2019)",

In this dataset, each category include 100 images which are with the size of 256 \u00d7 384 or 384 \u00d7 256 pixels (Wang et al 2001). 4.1.2.
