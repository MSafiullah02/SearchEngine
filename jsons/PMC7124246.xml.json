Clinical laboratories are focused on patient care, while public health laboratories are focused on the health of the entire population. Clinical laboratory information is directed to physicians, and from them, ends at patient care. In contrast, public health laboratories gather information for public health experts and epidemiologists, who must determine the cause of illnesses and outbreaks affecting patients in many hospitals, detect new and unusual threats to the health of the community, and respond to these threats and prevent them. These roles are complementary, and as many laboratory professionals are discovering, mutually supportive.",

Public health laboratories began to use pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to type isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other foodborne-illness pathogens, subdividing these isolates into closely related groups or clones, and allowing epidemiologists to efficiently investigate cases of infections and determine the cause. Often, clusters of cases are seen immediately by public health laboratory scientists when a group of isolates with a unique pattern are observed. Epidemiologists can investigate smaller numbers of cases and spend less time collecting the information that points to a particular food product. This has occurred many times since the initiation of the PulseNet system. Outbreaks caused by Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., E. coli O157, and Camplylobacter and Listeria spp. are detected, and the numbers of cases are limited when the incriminated food product is determined and recalled. Clinical laboratories are being encouraged to refer such pathogens quickly, rather than letting a group of isolates accumulate for convenient transport to a state laboratory, where outbreaks of foodborne illness can be identified rapidly, resulting in limitations on the extent of outbreaks (7).",

PulseNet works because clinical laboratories are effective in culturing agents of foodborne illness and referring these isolates quickly to public health laboratories that perform PFGE typing, conduct a statewide analysis, and then upload this information to the CDC database for nationwide analysis. This partnership has raised the level of detection of foodborne illness to unprecedented levels, virtually ensuring that no multistate outbreak of foodborne illness of any significant magnitude will go undetected. When three state laboratories determine a strain to be the same by PFGE typing, the recovery of a single isolate by each of three clinical microbiologists in three different states might be enough to detect a nationwide food problem.",
