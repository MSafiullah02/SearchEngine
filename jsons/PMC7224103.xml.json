Subjects were matched using a generalized boosted regression algorithm, an approach that provides effective weighting when utilizing a large number of matching covariates [8]. To assess the quality of the matching algorithm, distributions of covariates between male and female groups for RYGB and SG were assessed by absolute mean differences between groups (Figs. 1 and 2). Weights were applied to each subject and univariate analyses were repeated [9].",

Based on approximate parity of the incidence of obesity in the United States [2], our analysis demonstrate females continue to represent a disproportionately high number of patients undergoing either SG or RYGB procedures. In addition, males tend to have a slightly higher BMI and are older when they undergo bariatric procedures compared to than females. Clinically, males also had a significantly higher incidence of comorbidities than females that was also reflected in higher 30-day morbidity and mortality rates following either SG or RYGB. This disparity between males and females remained true even after controlling for pre-operative comorbidities with propensity matching, leading us to the conclusion that male gender is an independent risk factor in patients undergoing SG or RYGB. Prior to propensity matching, cardiac disease had one of the largest gender gaps in the preoperative patient demographics with males having almost 4 times the incidence compared to females. In addition, males had higher post-operative MI and other cardiac complications. This increased cardiac risk was controlled for during propensity matching and resulting in lower and similar cardiac complication rates between genders and a significant reduction in mortality and major complication rates in males. We can translate this into clinical practice by trying to identify as much cardiac disease as possible and optimize these conditions as much as possible preoperatively. Since Males had more cardiac disease before surgery and more cardiac complications after, these patients would benefit the most from having a lower threshold to perform a thorough cardiac assessment.",

Several studies have focused on gender differences in weight loss following bariatric surgery with findings suggesting higher, equal, or less weight loss in males [10\u201312]. However, it should be noted that the difference in excess weight loss between males and females averaged only 5% in either direction in these reports, suggesting the clinical and overall health impact of such differences are likely to be small. Despite these similarities in weight loss between sexes, males are reported to have improved psychological benefits after bariatric surgery compared to women. For example, Kochkodan et al. evaluated surveys from more than 61,000 patients from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative in 2018, and report males were found to have higher post-operative satisfaction, body image, and psychological wellbeing scores compared to females who underwent the same procedure concomitant with lower post-operative depression scores in males [13].",

            "text": "These finding pose several important clinical questions; if males and females have similar obesity rates and similar weight loss results after bariatric surgery, why does such a large gender gap remain between sexes for those undergoing bariatric surgery? From a broader perspective, the World Health Organization has investigated gender disparities in health care and report that (overall) men use health services less often than females, and are less likely to report symptoms when they do present to a health care provider. These findings correlate with the continued trend of male life expectancy growing at a slower rate than females, despite similar advances in healthcare [14]. This broad gender gap in healthcare also applies when considering obesity. Surveys report males to have lower body dissatisfaction scores, and to be more satisfied with their health and fitness overall, compared to females with similar BMIs [15] suggesting males may be less likely to seek medical treatment of their obesity because of their perceived \u201crelative health\u201d.",

            "text": "Similarly [since more women are likely to seek treatment for their obesity], when males do utilize health services, is there equivalence in efforts made by health care providers to counsel males on obesity and weight loss surgery? Chang and colleagues addressed this issue in 2017 by reviewing data from 66,263 clinic visits of patients with BMIs > 35 over a 15 year period (2000\u20132015) [16]. Data from this study report that despite males being counseled more frequently on bariatric surgery for weight loss (2.9% of males with BMI 42\u201345 kg/m2 vs. 2.0% of females; 6.2% of males with BMI > 45 kg/m2 vs. 3.7% of females) male patients were less likely to consider bariatric surgery than females of similar BMIs [16]. One potential explanation of these findings may be that males have higher obesity related quality of life scores and are more likely to think of bariatric surgery as being too risky [17]. These data suggest a more significant component of the bariatric surgery gender gap lies with disparities in perception males have for the impact of weight/weight loss on quality of life, as opposed to availability of counseling for weight loss surgery.",

Similarly, our analysis identified males presented (on average) 3 years older and 1.55 BMI points heavier than females. In addition, males had significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities (including hypertension, MI or history of cardiac procedure, diabetes, COPD, OSA, and hyperlipidemia) indicating males were higher risk patients for bariatric surgery. Given the differences in preoperative health, it was of little surprise that males had higher post-operative 30-day major complications and mortality rates compared to females, even when sub-dividing patients into RYGB and SG procedures. Indeed, our findings were similar to previously published studies analyzing data from 2005 to 2011 in which males were reported as having higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to females after bariatric surgery [5, 6]. However, it should be noted the morbidity and mortality rates in our study were significantly lower for both genders than reported in these studies in line with the improved safety profile of bariatric surgery over the past decade. Our analysis did demonstrate a significant difference in leak rates between males and females. However, the difference was only 0.02% and we did not consider this to be clinically relevant.",

These data reflect similar conclusions drawn from previous studies (albeit these studies having smaller patient cohorts than our analysis). For example, Carbon et al. used a multiple logistic regression approach to determine female gender to be protective against morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing gastric bypass (odds ratio of 0.65 and 0.34 respectively) [6]. while Lazzati et al. established male gender to be an independent risk factor in patients undergoing either, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB), SG, or RYGB (male post-operative mortality odds ratio of 1.94) [18].",

However, complications which remained highly significant after accounting for differences in preoperative comorbidities included death related to surgery and operative time. Therefore, one possible reason males continue to have higher mortality, despite controlling for comorbidities, is the increased difficulty of the operation due to male gender. This operative difficulty could be because males tend to have more central obesity (and therefore thicker abdominal walls) and more intraabdominal adipose tissue compared to females. An exception to these findings was that females had higher 30-day readmission rates for both RYGB and SG procedures due to higher rates of post-operative dehydration that required re-admission. However, this difference may not be due to female gender being a risk factor for dehydration/re-admission per se, but because males are less likely (overall) to seek medical attention.",

Additionally, propensity matching was difficult due to the number or unhealthy males and lack of sufficient unhealthy females to match with. Overall, these limitations should be balanced against strength of the study provided by the large sample size contained within the MBSAQIP\u00ae database that allows for detailed analysis of rare events (such as mortality) to be performed with sufficient statistical power.",
