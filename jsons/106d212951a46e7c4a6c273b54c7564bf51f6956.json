Approximately 50% of Canadian children receive one or more medications each year; this is up to 79% in infants <1 year old [2, 3] . While medication use is not uncommon, polypharmacy is much less common than in adult patients. Around 20% of US children received at least one medication in the previous week, but less than 6% had used two or more medications in the previous week [4, 5] . The most common medications filled for children in community pharmacies in 2012 included antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin, and cefprozil most commonly), asthma medications (salbutamol, fluticasone, montelukast), and medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (methylphenidate primarily) [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 444, "end": 447, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 577, "end": 579, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 833, "end": 835, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1155, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Before moving forward, it is important for pharmacists to understand age-related terminology for children. Gestational age (GA) is the duration of time a newborn has been in utero (full term is considered ~40 weeks) while post-natal age (PNA), also known as chronological age (CA), is the duration of time since birth (e.g., 2 weeks old). Corrected gestational age (CGA) or post-menstrual age (PMA) are terms used most commonly in infants born prematurely, and refer to their gestational age plus post-natal age. For instance, a baby born at 30 weeks GA, with a PNA/CA of 10 days would have a CGA/PMA of 31 weeks and 3 days (commonly abbreviated as 31 + 3 weeks). A neonate (or newborn) is an infant <28 days PNA/CA, or for premature infants, less than 44 weeks CGA/PMA. The term \"infant\" typically refers to a range of PNA/CA from 28 days to 1 year. The term \"toddler\" typically refers to age 1-3 years, and \"school-age\" refers to age from 4 to 9 years. \"Adolescent\" typically refers to age 10-19 years, though the true onset of adolescence is determined by the onset of puberty.

Table 28 .1 provides a summary of major pharmacokinetic considerations in infants and children. This variability in pharmacokinetics makes dosing medications in children especially challenging as there is no \"standard\" dose of a medication. Medication doses may vary based on CGA, PNA, as well as body weight or surface area.

This is an oversimplification, given that different aspects of renal and hepatic clearance develop at different rates. Full reviews of pharmacokinetic differences in children can be found in Kearns et al. [10] and Bartelink et al. [11] .

Until children are mature enough to provide this information themselves (note that this age varies depending on the child), parents and other caregivers are relied upon to provide an accurate history of the patient's illness(s) and medication(s). This provides an extra challenge to history gathering as the most appropriate person may not be available to provide this history, depending on the circumstances of the child's illness. Changing custody or living arrangements may impact a caregiver's ability to provide a history, or one parent may be \"in charge\" of the medical care of the child and another caregiver might happen to be the one present at the time of pharmacists' information gathering.

An important difference to note is that in infants (especially those in the first 3 months of life), maternal pregnancy and delivery history is relevant and should be gathered wherever possible as well. Maternal conditions during pregnancy and the circumstances of delivery may be very relevant to an infant's medical care. For instance, a mother using methadone for a substance abuse condition may result in her infant developing signs and symptoms of withdrawal several days after discharge home. Likewise, whether or not a mother received intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics is directly related to the infant's risk of Group B Streptococcus infection in the newborn period.

If there are multiple concentrations available due to variability in the \"recipe\" followed by the pharmacy during compounding, this can lead to dose errors and subsequent sequelae (see Box 28.1 for an example). If there are any questions regarding the strength of a formulation or volume given, call the pharmacy that provided the previous fill and clarify what was provided. Medications in tablet form (except many sustained or controlled release formulations) may be crushed or dissolved for ease of administration and the appropriateness of this practice should be assessed by the pharmacist depending on the size of the tablet, ease of splitting, and the possibility of alternate dosing intervals (e.g., a daily dose of ASA 20 mg can be delivered as a half tablet [40 mg] every other day instead of a quarter tablet [20 mg] every day). Some medications may be given in a \"dissolve-adose\" manner, whereby a tablet is crushed and suspended in a small amount of liquid, then the dose is measured from the resulting suspension.

In these cases, the medication may be given with feeds (formula or breastmilk) for ease of administration, but a slightly higher dose may need to be used empirically, or the dose may be titrated up based on monitoring parameters (e.g., levothyroxine based on TSH). If this occurs, the administration conditions should be kept consistent for the individual patient, even if \"manufacturer recommendations\" suggest otherwise. Parents and caregivers may ask if it is appropriate to mix all of a child's medications together in one syringe/cup prior to administration.

A common error is to use pediatric doses for neonates; therefore, the age of infants needs to be confirmed. In addition to selection of the appropriate dosing category, the pharmacist must also ensure that the appropriate dose for the indication in question is considered. Doses for medications can vary significantly for different indications. For example, the ASA dose for antiplatelet effects is 1-5 mg/kg/day, where anti-inflammatory doses range from 60 to 100 mg/kg/day. The next step is another common source of error: calculations. Doses should never be estimated and calculations should never be done in the pharmacist's head. A calculator is an essential tool for pediatric pharmacists. Pediatric doses are typically listed in mg/kg/DAY divided qXh, or can be listed as mg/kg/DOSE given qXh. This is a common source of error and must be carefully checked by the pharmacist. While it is common to see pediatric doses that are higher than adult doses on a mg/kg basis because of the pharmacokinetic differences noted above, it is important to note that adult maximum daily doses (total mg) should typically still be observed in pediatric patients.

While these observations have some degree of objectivity, many assessments done in this way may include some subjectivity. For this reason, other objective measures may be relied upon more frequently in younger children than in older children or adults. For instance, the objective presence of a fever and results of key lab values (e.g. normalization of white blood cell count) can supplement a parent's subjective report of a child feeling better and acting more \"like himself\" in an assessment of an infection's response to antibiotics. Pain scoring tools that include a measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, as well as an observation of the infants' behavior can add an objective component to a parent's assessment of their child's pain.

Blood cultures in children are typically limited to two bottles (adults typically use four bottles), and use smaller volumes of blood, resulting in a higher risk of false-negative results. The reduced number of bottles also makes distinguishing between pathogenic growth and contamination more difficult. In adults, growth of skin flora in one out of four blood culture bottles is typically associated with contamination; however in children growth of the same pathogen in one out of two bottles is less convincing as contamination. For these reasons, it is not uncommon to empirically treat a child for an infection despite negative cultures, purely based on signs and symptoms of infection. This represents a particular challenge for pharmacists attempting to tailor antibiotic therapy to infectious pathogens. Antibiotic therapy may have to be assessed based on \"typical\" pathogens rather than actual. When considering \"typical\" pathogens, these vary by age and so pharmacists need to consider this when assessing the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. Another major factor in the \"likely\" bacteria pathogens is immunization status, and pharmacists should be familiar with vaccination history in patients presenting with infectious diseases.

However, in younger children and for smaller doses, the use of oral liquids may be the only solution. Oral liquids should be mea-sured in appropriately sized devices. Often, especially in infants, doses may be so small that accurate measurement becomes challenging. Doses less than 1 mL are ideally measured in 1 mL (or even 0.5 mL) oral syringes in order to maximize accuracy. Typically, manufacturer guidance dictates that doses <10% of the syringe size cannot be accurately measured (e.g., no less than 0.1 mL in a 1 mL syringe or 0.05 mL in a 0.5 mL syringe). Occasionally, unique solutions to measurability issues need to be explored. Very small doses of some injectable products (e.g., enoxaparin doses <10 mg) may be most easily measured using an insulin syringe (e.g., 1 unit = 0.01 mL = 1 mg enoxaparin). Very small doses of oral medications only available in capsules may require (very careful) preparation of powder papers which involves weighing of powders from capsules and packaging in specially folded papers. Whatever the situation, pharmacists must ensure that parents and caregivers using medications in children have an accurate method of measurement available as well as a practical approach to giving the medication.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measurability"}, {"text": "If a medication must be delivered to the child as an unpalatable oral liquid there are some approaches to helping mask the taste of the medication. In infants, most medications can be mixed with a small amount of formula or breastmilk to improve palatability. It is important to instruct parents or caregivers not to mix medications in a full volume of feed (i.e., a full bottle) as the complete dose may not be delivered if the full amount of feed is not taken. Older children may find eating frozen treats prior to taking the medication may numb the tongue enough and reduce the bad taste. Similarly, allowing the child to choose a food or drink to wash the medication taste away may be helpful. Concentrated, sugary beverages or foods (honey, chocolate syrup) or other strongly flavored foods (cheeses) may help mask or remove the taste from the child's mouth.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Palatability"}, {"text": "Administering oral medications to children can be a significant challenge in itself. After measurement with an appropriate device, oral liquids can be given to infants mixed with a small amount of milk/formula through a bottle nipple, or for older children they can be mixed in a small amount of palatable food or liquid before administration. Alternatively, oral liquids can simply be expelled into the cheek (where there are no tastebuds) followed with a drink of palatable liquid. Iron liquid can stain teeth, and so rinsing the mouth is important (can also use a straw if the mediation has been diluted in a liquid). Note that these precau-tions are unnecessary in infants without teeth, and most important in those with their permanent teeth.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Medication Administration"}, {"text": "The ability to swallow oral solid dosage forms makes oral medication administration easier, and this can usually occur around age 5 or 6 years. If children struggle with pill swallowing, they can practice with candies with increasing sizes (e.g., start with sprinkles, slowly increasing the size of the candies up to the target tablet size. Usually small jelly beans are sufficiently sized for most medications). Children can place the medication/candy on the back of their tongue, tilt their head back, and have a large drink of liquid to facilitate this. In rare cases, infants and small children can swallow small oral dosage forms with appropriate instruction from qualified professionals. An example is levothyroxine, where crushed tablets and suspensions may not provide the necessary accuracy and part-tablets are the preferred dosage form.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Medication Administration"}, {"text": "Medications to be administered via feeding tubes (e.g., nasogastric tubes, gastrojejunal tubes) can be administered without palatability concerns; however the intestinal location of the medication administration should be considered in the context of the intestinal administration site (e.g., ensure the medication can be absorbed if administered into the jejunum), and the tubes should be flushed with water afterward to ensure complete delivery of the dose.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Medication Administration"}, {"text": "As a final comment on adherence assessment, it is important to consider adolescents specifically. Increasing independence with medication use and administration is often given to adolescents as they move toward adulthood, which requires a change in the pharmacist's approach. Where previously assessment was conducted primarily with the caregivers on behalf of the child, the pharmacist should begin to include the adolescents in these conversations in an attempt to build their health literacy and knowledge of their conditions/medications. Also of note, adolescents often become more self-conscious of their medical conditions and associated medication use, and strategies to increase the discreteness of Ensure caregivers have a practical approach to measurement and administration of the required doses Assess for palatability issues Observe measurement and/or administration of medications by caregivers Help transition adolescents to adulthood and independent medication use their medication use may be appreciated and improve adherence. For example, selection of a dry powder inhaler instead of a metered-dose inhaler with spacer device, or choosing a once or twice-a-day administered agent instead of one that has to be used at school. Considerations such as these should come into a pharmacist's assessment as their pediatric patients move toward adulthood. Assessing medication use in children has many similarities to that in adults, and should be approached in a similarly systematic way, bearing slight nuances in mind.
