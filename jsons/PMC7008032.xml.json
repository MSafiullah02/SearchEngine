This approach reduces liver metabolic activity, allowing safe storage for up to 12\u201318 h (refs. 1,2). Recently, the combination of supercooling with subzero storage (\u22124 \u00b0C) and hypothermic, as well as subnormothermic, machine perfusion achieved an extension of the preservation time of human livers up to 27 h (ref. 2). By contrast, human livers can also be kept metabolically fully active for up to 24 h by supplying normothermic blood or oxygenated fluids in a controlled environment by machine perfusion1,3\u20135. The possibility of repairing poor-quality livers sufficiently to enable transplantation requires preserving metabolically active livers1,3 for several days. Accordingly, the need for long-term organ preservation technology has been endorsed by multiple private and governmental initiatives1. However, currently used normothermic machine perfusion technologies have been used only for a relatively short time period (for example, a median perfusion time of 9 h (ref. 5)), to successfully maintain hemodynamics, perfusate oxygenation and temperature.",

We chose 7-d as a target because this time period has been shown to offer a credible time frame for inducing clinically relevant liver regeneration in patients undergoing complex liver resection6\u20138. Under physiologic conditions, the liver, which constitutes 2.5% of body weight, receives 25% of the blood output of the heart and performs >5,000 functions9. It has a unique dual vascular supply with high-pressure, oxygen-rich arterial blood entering through the hepatic artery and low-pressure, oxygen-reduced portal vein blood draining the abdominal viscera. Its high metabolic activity produces waste products that are excreted in the bile or removed by hepatic macrophages or the kidneys. The metabolic profile is largely controlled by pancreatic hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Our perfusion technology, developed in the \u201cLiver4Life project\u201d, includes automated control of glucose levels by injection of insulin and glucagon, a dialysis membrane for waste-product removal, regulation of oxygenation and liver movement to prevent pressure necrosis.",

            "text": "Our perfusion machine (Fig. 1a,b) recapitulates blood supply through the two vascular entries of the liver, the hepatic artery and portal vein. The hepatic artery is supplied with oxygen-rich blood at elevated pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u2265 65 mmHg) in a pulsatile manner (Fig. 1c), whereas the portal vein receives blood at low pressure (around 5\u201310 mmHg) with a reduced oxygen content (venous blood, non-pulsatile). The system maintains oxygen saturation of 65% in the vena cava by continuously adjusting oxygen content in the portal vein (Fig. 1d). In vivo, nutrients and bile salts are transported from the intestine to the liver via the portal vein. To recapitulate this, we inject parenteral nutrition and ursodeoxycholic acid into the portal vein line of our perfusion machine. Hepatic artery hemodynamics are tightly controlled by automated infusion of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (Fig. 1e) into the hepatic artery line. The pressure in the vena cava is continuously kept at physiological levels close to 0 mmHg (0\u20132 mmHg) to prevent liver congestion. An oxygenator provides oxygen to the hepatic artery and to the portal vein while removing CO2 from the perfusate. The oxygen tension in the hepatic artery is continuously monitored and controlled to remain in predefined bounds, that is, 10\u201312 kPa. The CO2 tension is adapted via the oxygenator to maintain blood pH between 7.25 and 7.45 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We incorporated an integrated dialysis unit for physiologic electrolyte balance and removal of metabolic waste products from the blood.",

An additional effect of dialysis was the automated modulation of a transmembrane flow (TMF) of dialysate across the dialysis filter membrane, which allows the control of the hematocrit level (Fig. 2f). These refinements enabled us to run perfusion for 7-d without the need for exchanging the perfusate or using any additional blood products.

To avoid over oxygenation in the portal vein, we mixed the deoxygenated venous blood from the blood reservoir with the freshly oxygenated blood from the oxygenator. An algorithm enabled automatic adjustment of oxygen saturation in the portal vein to maintain a target saturation of 65% in the vena cava (Fig. 1d). With this approach, the need for vasodilators decreased from 285 \u00b1 162 milliliters per week to 41 \u00b1 34 milliliters per week (P = 0.011), despite maintaining physiologic flow in the hepatic artery (Fig. 2i).",

In pilot studies, keeping the liver in situ in cadaveric pigs, we tested the importance of diaphragm movement by artificially maintaining lung ventilation. We found that ventilation-associated diaphragm movement prevented pressure necrosis (Fig. 2j). To simulate this movement in the ex vivo system, we placed the liver on a silicone mat, which was fixed on the edges inside the organ chamber. An inflatable balloon was positioned beneath the mat and connected to an air oscillator to induce oscillating movement (automated lifting and lowering) of the liver 15 times per minute (Supplementary Fig. 1). To test adequate perfusion after 7 d of ex vivo perfusion, we evaluated the distribution of the radioactive tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as an indicator of preserved metabolism and viability inside the liver with positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT). This approach demonstrated homogeneous metabolism and iodinated contrast medium distribution with absence of non-perfused areas in contact places to the silicon mat (Fig. 2k).",

Thus, electrolyte levels and pH were corrected through an integrated dialysis before starting perfusion. Second, pig and human livers disclosed differences in the sensitivity toward glucagon, with the need to adjust glucagon levels (0.11 U ml\u22121 in human versus 0.01 U ml\u22121 in pigs). Third, the vasodilator nitroprussiat used in pigs is not approved for human use in Switzerland and was therefore replaced by epoprostinolium (Flolan, GlaxoSmithKline)11. Fourth, the final human protocol includes ursodeoxycholic acid, which is commonly used in the clinic, in place of taurocholic acid derivatives for bile flow stimulation.",

Many of these livers suffer additionally from prepreservation injury (that is, injury occurring before recovery of the organ owing to, for example, instability of the donor before death or medical treatment in intensive care units) and ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury at the time of preservation and transplantation24. Consequently, cell death (~15%) is observed in most post-transplant biopsy specimens, even under optimal clinical conditions25,26. Similar to clinical transplantation, ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury is unavoidable in machine-perfused livers when connecting the liver to the machine after cold storage and subsequently perfusing with oxygenated perfusates. To assess the livers during machine perfusion, we measured a number of parameters. In the perfusate, we monitored hepatocellular enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST), signaling proteins (damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)), uric acid, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and clearance of ammonia and lactate. We also measured liver tissue energy sources, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycogen in tissue (measurement details are provided in the Methods). We also obtained daily liver tissue samples for histology. The liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain, and with antibodies against von Willebrand factor, phosphohistone 3 (pH3), CD68, cleaved caspase 3, Ki-67 and cytokeratin 7 (Methods).",

These parameters were combined with the response of the livers to added vasoconstrictors, as failing liver grafts are frequently characterized by severe vasoplegia, requiring high dosages of vasoconstrictors to maintain adequate blood flow in the clinical setting33. Some livers became unresponsive to vasoconstrictors during the perfusion course. The reason for failure in those livers probably relates to excessive warm or cold ischemia times, in combination with prepreservation injury recognized in the clinic as extended graft criteria, enhancing severe ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury17. In Fig. 5, we summarize our current understanding of how to best assess liver function and viability during ex vivo perfusion. Besides the conventional parameters (that is, lactate clearance, perfusate pH and bile production) as previously proposed4,34\u201336, we rely on the response to glycolytic hormones, vasoactive drugs and on clearance of ammonia, as well as histology and ATP synthesis.",

Similarly, the well-established circadian liver weight fluctuation has no negative impact on hepatic function38. Of note, we did not observe any weight change when using healthy pig livers (preperfusion weight of 1.7 \u00b1 0.03 kg, post-perfusion weight 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 kg).

Consequently, machine perfusion strategies should target primarily mitochondrial metabolism39, for example, by applying membrane-permeable scavengers and reversible inhibitors of electron transfer, or by prevention of the opening of permeability transition pores. An ex vivo system offers the potential advantage of avoiding such undesirable systemic effects in the recipient. We envision our technology being used primarily with organs currently declined for transplantation, with long-term ex vivo perfusion under physiologic conditions potentially enabling the rescue of organs or their modification in a variety of ways. For example, 1-week perfusion may enable repair of severely steatotic livers, modification of the immunogenicity of the graft or recipient to induce tolerance, or treatment of tumors in livers using effective chemotherapeutic agents that are too toxic for systemic use. In addition, long-term perfusion would allow organs to be transported safely over long distances, improving worldwide organ sharing and logistics for transplantation in many centers1,3. Another opportunity in the future might be to enable liver regeneration, with a donor liver split into several anatomic segments to regrow in the machine. Recent surgical procedures have shown that massive liver regeneration in humans can occur within 6 d of major tissue loss7. If feasible, such an approach could double or even triple the availability of organs for transplantation. We may also imagine the use of partial grafts for auto-transplantation in patients with liver cancer, obviating the need for immune suppression.",

By means of the height difference between the liver and the reservoir, a suction pressure was induced and additionally controlled through a pinch valve between the vena cava and the reservoir to control a desired vena cava pressure. The pinch valve induced an additional pressure drop, allowing elevation of the pressure at the vena cava to the desired levels. If the blood pressure inside the vena cava was lower than the surrounding ambient pressure, the vessel wall collapsed (usually around 0 mmHg), closed shortly and therefore induced a certain (negative) pressure fluctuation in the VC line. This induced pressure fluctuation was utilized in the control system to target the desired vena cava pressure. Finally, this pressure fluctuation (collapse of the vena cava) was detected by the pressure sensor in the vena cava line, with the control system reacting accordingly by closing the pinch valve in the vena cava line and thereby increasing the target vena cava pressure automatically by 1 mmHg, slightly above the fluctuation point. The system continuously monitored the minimum and maximum value of the vena cava pressure of the last 30 s. If the difference between the minimum and maximum vena cava pressure in this time interval was greater than a certain threshold defined by the system (usually 10 mmHg), a fluctuation was detected. Afterward, the control system immediately increased the pressure in the vena cava line by a value of 1 mmHg, as described above. During normal operation, the system continuously searched for the fluctuation point. This was done by permanently decreasing the pressure set point for the vena cava by a rate of 1 mmHg per hour. Once fluctuation had been detected, the set point was again increased using the algorithm described above, and the system again began to search for the fluctuation pressure. This control strategy was implemented owing to the fact that the pressure distribution inside the vena cava line depended on the flow rate and therefore the vena cava pressure was also flow-rate dependent. During the perfusion duration, the total flow rate through the vena cava line always varied over time. Therefore, a steady search for the fluctuation point was implemented (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

An online blood-gas sensor (Terumo CDI 500 Shunt Sensor) continuously measured pO2, pCO2 and pH. A proportional integral controller defined the oxygen concentration in the gas supply of the oxygenator to maintain pO2 at the desired level (10\u201312 kPa). Another proportional integral controller defined the total gas flow rate (oxygen and nitrogen) to control the wash-out rate of pCO2 in the perfusate. With CO2 being present in its dissolved form as carbonic acid in the blood, the pCO2 level could be manipulated to vary pH in a certain range. The pCO2 was allowed to vary from 4.5 to 6.5 kPa to maintain a target pH of around 7.4. With the inverse proportionality between pCO2 and pH, an increasing pCO2 lead to a decrease in pH, that is, the blood became more acidic. Therefore, to reduce the pH, less pCO2 was washed out by reducing the total gas flow rate through the oxygenator, resulting in an increase of pCO2. The control was implemented by means of a control cascade with the inner control loop maintaining the secondary target pCO2 and the outer control loop maintaining the primary target pH of 7.4 by varying the pCO2 set point in the defined range of 4.5 to 6.5 kPa. CO2 was only supplied in the gas stream to the oxygenator before starting the liver perfusion and in the initial phase until the liver produced enough CO2 to maintain the target pCO2 in the blood. In the normal perfusion phase, a surplus of CO2 is produced by the liver, requiring it to be washed out.",

To mimic the physiologically reduced oxygen saturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir was mixed with a portion of arterial blood leaving the oxygenator. For this purpose, the pO2 was measured in the portal vein by means of an online blood-gas sensor (Shunt Sensor, Terumo, CDI 500) as stated above. In addition, the system continuously monitored the oxygen saturation in the vena cava (vSO2) using a saturation sensor (CDI H/S Cuvette, Terumo, CDI 500). To mimic the physiological venous oxygen saturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir (blood from the vena cava with low, venous saturation) bypassed the oxygenator and was mixed with a portion of the arterial blood from the oxygenator to achieve desired saturation levels. The control was realized by means of a cascaded control. The inner control loop controlled the blood flow rate of the oxygenated blood (arterial blood) and the \u2018bypass flow rate\u2019 by means of a continuous pinch valve. The outer control loop controlled the oxygen saturation of the vena cava by varying the set point of the bypass flow rate. The goal was to keep a stable oxygenation level in the vena cava of 65% by varying the portal vein oxygen content. The total flow rate in the portal vein was maintained at 1 l min\u22121. An increase of flow in the bypass was automatically compensated to maintain a constant total flow rate in the portal vein.",

The targeted TMF was defined by the user or the controller of the system. Usually, the TMF was in the range of \u2212100 ml h\u22121 to 100 ml h\u22121. By controlling the TMF, the system can vary the amount of blood plasma in the perfusate and, thus, control the hematocrit level in perfusate.

Glucose had to be substituted to maintain glucose levels in the perfusate within the normal range (green rectangle). b, Integrity in histology. (1) Livers 1\u20136 (n = 6 livers), representative hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrating the preserved integrity without relevant cell death on day 7. (2) Livers 7\u201310 (n = 4 livers), representative hematoxylin and eosin staining with massive cell death on day 4 with loss of integrity. Scale bars: overview, 500 \u00b5m; higher magnification, 100 \u00b5m. c, Evaluation of liver function and injury markers: Livers with massive cell death might maintain some of the liver functions including, for example, lactate clearance. Therefore, we consider these listed liver functions only as viability markers in combination with adequate response to hormones and vasoactive substances, as well as histology. Additionally, it should be noted that the kinetics of cytokine and injury marker release are more decisive than peak values, as absolute levels are dependent on liver mass and perfusate volume.",
