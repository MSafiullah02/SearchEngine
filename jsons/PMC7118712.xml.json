To calculate the number of animals required to detect a true dose effect, a power analysis was performed and the desired significance level (\u03b1) was set at .05, power was set at 0.8, and the difference to detect between groups was set at 80%. By using a power chart for a variance of 1, a sample size of 6 falls between a power value of 0.8 to 0.92. By using these parameters, 5-6 animals per group would be the maximum required. A minimum of 5 animals was included in each treatment group, except the low- and high-dose groups. In accordance with the mandate of the Animal Welfare Act, we reduced the number of animals used at the highest and lowest infection dose. Because the results showed no colonization at the low dose (n = 4) and maximum colonization at the high dose (n = 5), no additional rats were infected at those doses.",

Six fetal units were chosen at random for culture, and the remaining fetal units were placed in buffered formalin (1:10; Biochemical Sciences, Inc, Swedesboro, NJ) for histopathologic evaluation. The intact fetal unit (placenta, chorionic and amniotic membranes, amniotic fluid [AF], and fetus) with uterine tissues attached on either side of the placenta was removed. Each fetal unit and its corresponding tissues were labeled such that the fetal unit of origin could be identified. The placenta was separated from the endometrium and fetal membranes before culture. AF from each fetal unit was obtained by puncturing the chorioallantoic membrane with a sterile needle.22, 25, 26 The fetus was disinfected with 70% ethanol before aseptic dissection and the fetal brain, lung, and spleen/liver was removed and minced separately for culture.",

There were a number of AFs that were culture negative, even when the corresponding placentas had mycoplasmas isolated at log CFU greater than 5 (Figure 3). Conversely, there were isolated cases in which the AF was infected without placental infection. The discrepancies between AF colonization and colonization levels in fetal lung and brain, in which mycoplasmal log CFU greater than 2 could be obtained in the absence of infected AF (Figure 4) are also intriguing. Colonization of the fetal spleen/liver also occurred in the absence of AF infection, and in some instances the number of mycoplasmas recovered from spleen/liver were several logs higher than the corresponding isolations from AF. Taken together, these data suggest that in at least some cases, fetal colonization preceded AF colonization.",

Colonization of SD rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after IV inoculation, similar to colonization results seen previously in vaginally and IV-infected rats.20, 22, 25, 26 The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus is at least 103 CFU, with consistent colonization of all tissues achieved only with 107 CFU. For rat fetal units, the 105 dose may be too low to achieve ID50, but this dose would allow comparisons to be made between infected and uninfected fetal tissues within the same dam. The 105 dose may be a valuable tool to determine whether the maternal response to infection, without the confounding presence of infection in the fetus, influences fetal growth and development. At the 107 dose, consistent infection of fetal and placental tissues can be achieved for use in collecting infection data from an entire litter.",

Conversely, the uterus and vagina were colonized by M pulmonis in all dams at the 107 dose. This strongly suggests that there is an affinity for infection of the reproductive tract vs the respiratory tract after IV inoculation of pregnant rats. One explanation for this result may be the increased vascularization of the reproductive tract during gestation. Increased vascularization may more easily allow the microorganism to access and adhere in these regions. These tissues also may be enriched for nutrients that would favor the growth of M pulmonis. The tropism of M pulmonis for the reproductive tissues appears to be pregnancy-specific; in a previous study M pulmonis was recovered from the trachea in 35 of 36 naturally infected nonpregnant rats but was isolated from the uterus of only 17 of these same rats.21 Further, in rats experimentally infected in the vagina before breeding, the reproductive tissues were more commonly colonized than the trachea once pregnancy was established.22, 25, 26\n",

We observed that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis from the infected placenta to the fetus can occur without AF infection, and that, in some cases, the fetus itself could potentially seed the AF with microorganisms. This is consistent with some models proposed for human fetal infections that suggest the most severe consequences of intrauterine infection occur when the infectious agent colonizes the placenta and then is transported to the AF and fetus via hematogenous spread from the placenta.1, 29, 30, 31\n",

Although the vaginal model of infection is a more natural method of causing intrauterine infection, it also has limitations such as increased time to establish infection and uncertainty of level of infection. In addition, significant intrauterine infection is seen only in animals infected before breeding rather than at time points throughout gestation.20, 21, 22 The IV model is more useful for studying acute, temporal effects of infection, whereas the vaginal infection model is better suited for chronic situations. Studies focused on mechanisms of low birthweight would be more appropriate for the vaginal model20 as acute infection established in IV-infected rats did not result in low birthweight. An additional limitation of the model is that the use of M pulmonis rather than U parvum/urealyticum precludes addressing microbe-specific factors that may be involved in pathogenesis. This is somewhat analogous to other models, for example, that use purified LPS rather than live Gram-negative microbes for infection studies or that use of in vitro cell lines rather than whole animal studies; these models still provide critical insights into pathogenesis.",
