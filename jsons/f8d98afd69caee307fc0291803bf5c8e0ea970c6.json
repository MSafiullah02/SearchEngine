            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness that first emerged in China in November 2002. SARS is caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus. 1 The 2003 emergence of this disease in the Pacific Rim was especially concerning to U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), which serves as the world's first line of defense against an attack from North Korea. During a time when North Korea continues to antagonize the world with its nuclear program, USFK personnel must be ready to transition to hostilities at a moment's notice and cannot afford to be debilitated by illness. By treating SARS as an enemy that had to be defended against, USFK presented a uniquely proactive response to this emerging threat and was able to successfully institute a major program to mitigate the impact of this disease if significant Korean importation occurred. USFK regarded the date of the global alert for the SARS virus (March 12, 2003) as Epidemic Day or \"E-Day,\" which represented the day the epidemic began.",

It was not until a medical professor who treated SARS patients in China's Guangdong Province became ill while spending the night of February 21, 2003, in the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong that the disease migrated outside southern China. Twelve other guests from the hotel subsequently were infected and became the initial patients to spread the disease globally. By late March, the virus was rampant in other countries within the Pacific Rim, and the mysterious new virus started receiving international media attention. 2 The USFK commander expressed his concerns to the USFK command surgeon on March 29, 2003, and declared the \"War on SARS.\"",

On March 15, 2003, medical planners and clinicians from three levels of command (USFK, Eighth U.S. Army, and 18th Medical Command), as well as three military services (Army, Air Force, and Navy), came together and formed a medical crisis action team (CAT). The initial guidance from the commander was to prevent a USFK epidemic and to take any and all reasonable, feasible, and logical measures to prevent an outbreak. In the eventuality that an outbreak occurred, then the CAT was to contain the spread of SARS before it could significantly affect the health and readiness of USFK servicemen, their family members, and civilians on the Peninsula. The CAT convened on Friday, April 4, 2003 , and began the military decisionmaking process designed to give the commander various courses of action to respond to the crisis. The commander issued a mission statement that stated, \"Take proactive actions to prevent an outbreak of SARS within the USFK population, and if prevention fails, contain an outbreak before it affects unit readiness or community health, so that there is no interruption of USFK missions, operations, or training.\" 5",

In retrospect, the illness sometimes did not progress to a severe respiratory phase, with the severity of the illness widely ranging from mild illness to death. SARS was primarily transmitted through close contact with an infected person, although some cases of transmission were found to have occurred through only indirect contact.

Consequently, it was decided that a robust preventive medicine initiative was the key to limiting the spread of SARS. This initiative included health surveillance, medical screenings, contact tracing, data collection, reporting, and follow-up surveillance. Following through with this initiative required the USFK surgeon's cell to establish a mandatory medical screening policy for all individuals who returned from a SARS-infected country. This policy directed commanders to identify all personnel who had traveled to restricted or advisory locations within the past 30 days and to ensure that they were expeditiously screened for SARS symptoms by trained medical personnel. This created a monumental challenge for the medical staff members currently providing health care across the Peninsula. They met the challenge by establishing the 18th Medical Command 24-hour SARS hotline (737-SARS). All U.S. personnel who traveled from Korea to a SARS-infected country were identified by their commanders. The hotline allowed trained medical personnel to telephonically screen people who traveled to SARS-infected countries and cities immediately upon their return, without requiring them to physically see a health care provider. If any of these individuals were found to meet the criteria for significant exposure, suspect SARS, or probable SARS, then they would immediately be referred to their nearest medical treatment facility (MTF). A stay in a SARS-affected country for \u03fe2 weeks was considered presumptively to be a significant exposure requiring a mandatory 10-day well quarantine (see below) even for persons without any symptoms, including personnel deployed to these locations for official duty.",

On April 10, 2003, USFK medical personnel implemented more-stringent standards for dealing with potential SARS patients. Signs warning persons who had traveled to SARS-active areas not to enter the hospital but to proceed to a specially designated SARS evaluation area outside were posted at all entrances to MTFs (Fig. 2) . Appointment clerks were educated to ask about SARS possibility for all patients requesting appointments and referred those with SARS concerns to the SARS evaluation area.

Medical surveillance indicated that health care facilities were the most notorious for spreading the virus. Therefore, the CAT recognized the immediate need to establish alternative locations to treat potential SARS patients. A temporary solution was to erect climate-controlled temper tents located in the vicinity of major military medical facilities throughout the Peninsula. This would reduce the threat of a SARS patient spreading the virus to other patients and health care providers within the hospitals. However, the SARS epidemic highlighted the need to construct a permanent biohazard isolation/treatment facility designed to house and to treat multiple, highly infectious patients simultaneously. The CAT researched numerous locations to establish this facility and decided on a partially vacant building only a few blocks from the 121 General Hospital in Seoul, the largest U.S. military hospital in Korea. Funding for the facility was quickly obligated, and the project took only 7 days from initial design to construction, which began on April 30, 2003. The total expense, including construction costs, was $350,000, which included equipment, supplies, and civilian employee overtime labor associated with getting the facility constructed quickly. A large majority of the equipment (nearly $240,000) for this new facility was transferred from U.S. Air Force war-contingency stocks in Kimhae, providing the facility with state-of-the-art equipment including two negative-pressure rooms providing eight beds each, with a positive-pressure nurses station.

Nearly 90% of these infections occurred in the Pacific Rim. 9 Although international travel did import probable SARS cases to the Korean Peninsula and 42 USFK personnel were quarantined, not a single suspect or probable case emerged among USFK personnel. We may never truly know the reason why the SARS epidemic avoided Korea, but the immediate recognition of the threat by medical surveillance team members, the rapid production of a SARS response plan by the CAT, and the tremendous command emphasis on control measures at all levels acknowledge the commitment by USFK personal to respond to this threat. The global outbreak of SARS seems to be under control. However, the need for vigilance has not diminished. As long as there is limited knowledge of the illness and no effective vaccine, there is a risk of a rapid reoccurrence. Although SARS was the first severe and readily transmittable new disease to emerge in the 21st century, the infection and mortality rates were minimal, compared historically with other highly infectious diseases. It is imperative that USFK personnel, as well as other U.S. forces stationed around the world, continue to improve their response plans and to incorporate these lessons learned.",

He directed his preventive medicine officer and his intelligence officer to form a SARS surveillance team, to monitor the SARS situation, and to establish direct communication with the Korean Armed Forces Medical Command, the Korean National Institute of Health, and the U.S. Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC) to keep abreast of the situation. This SARS surveillance team closely tracked the spread of the virus and established direct communication with the U.S. military liaison officer to both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to receive the most up-to-date information and latest developments on SARS. During the last 2 weeks of March 2003, SARS began to spread throughout the Pacific Rim, as well as North America and Europe, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue a travel advisory on March 28, 2003, urging people planning elective or nonessential travel to Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Vietnam to postpone their trips until further notice. 3 USFK immediately disseminated this travel advisory, recommending that service members and their families not visit these locations except for mission-essential activities. However, the recommendation to the USFK command surgeon from his SARS surveillance team was that the USFK commander should issue a travel restriction for Mainland China and Hong Kong, because of local transmission of the virus in those two locations. This recommendation was approved on April 3, 2003, and stated, \"All DoD personnel, including DoD civilians assigned to or working in Korea, are prohibited from official travel to, or through, Mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice. All DoD military personnel are prohibited from unofficial travel to, or through, Mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
