[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Some have suggested that calciumchannel blockers, which do not act on the RAAS, may be the preferred antihypertensive agents during the Covid-19 pandemic. 8 Further fueling these concerns is the observation that hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of death among patients with Covid-19. A large, multicenter study on hypertension and risk of Covid-19 indicated that 24% of patients with severe disease had hypertension, as compared with 14% of patients with nonsevere disease, although that analysis was not adjusted for other clinical features. 9 However, ACE2 is protective in animal models of acute lung injury, and pretreatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers may reduce the extent of experimentally induced lung injury and improve outcomes, an effect mediated by inhibition of the RAAS. 2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Thus, others have hypothesized that these medications could theoretically be beneficial, reducing the risk of severe disease among patients with Covid-19. 2 Owing to the high global prevalence of hypertension (estimated to be 46% among adults in the United States), the relation between antihypertensive medications and Covid-19 outcomes is very important to public health. 2,16 These considerations led the Heart Failure Society of America, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association to issue a joint statement calling for immediate research into this issue. 17 We sought to estimate the association between the use of antihypertensive medications and the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 as well as the likelihood of severe Covid-19 (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) in a cohort of patients in a large health care network in New York City, an epicenter of the global Covid-19 pandemic.",

We extracted medication data for each patient, on the basis of the history in the electronic health record, and defined previous treatment with an antihypertensive medication as use of the medication within the preceding 18 months, provided that there was no evidence that the medication was discontinued at least 1 month before the Covid-19 test.

As our prior distribution, we assumed a Beta (a,b) distribution, a conjugate to the binomial distribution, with both shape parameters a and b equal to 1. Because very few data are currently available, these uninformative parameters produce prior probabilities of outcomes that are distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. We estimated the difference as the median of the posterior samples, along with a 95% credible interval for the difference. Association between a medication class and an outcome was considered to be present when the 95% credible interval excluded zero. A substantial difference was considered to be present when the lower boundary of the 95% credible interval exceeded zero and the upper boundary exceeded 10 percentage points. We conducted sensitivity analyses using traditional frequentist approaches rather than Bayesian approaches and using adjusted logistic regression rather than propensity-score matching.

There was also no substantially higher risk (by \u226510 percentage points) of severe Covid-19 associated with any of the medications studied among the patients with a positive test in our cohort. In most cases, the study sample size permitted us, with a high degree of confidence, to rule out that the risk was higher -even by as little as 6 percentage points -among treated patients than among untreated patients. An effect size smaller than 10 percentage points may be of clinical interest, but we elected to report our findings now before the accrual of a larger sample in order to provide actionable information to the medical community, given the urgency and the rapid progression of the pandemic. Our findings may help to allay concerns on the part of patients and providers regarding the continued use of these agents in patients undergoing testing or receiving treatment for Covid-19.",

            "text": "Our data suggested a modestly lower likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 among patients taking beta-blockers that was of marginal significance in an analysis that included all matched patients. This finding could be attributable to effects of beta-blockers on the expression or presentation at the cell surface of ACE2, the viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, or residual confounding in the observational study design. To be relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect on ACE2 would need to be present on respiratory epithelium, but relevant studies in animals or humans are limited, so this proposed mechanism remains speculative. Furthermore, we did not observe a similar effect with ACE inhibitors Two small studies have shown consistent findings regarding the association between cardiac medications and Covid-19. In a multisite database study that included 78 patients with hypertension who were 65 years of age or older in China, there was no association between previous treatment with any cardiovascular medication class and severe Covid-19, but the risk of severe Covid-19 was lower in a subgroup of 46 patients who had received previous treatment with an ARB than among patients who had not received any of the five drug classes assessed in our study. 19 A single-center study from China showed no significant difference in the likelihood of severe illness related to treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in 42 patients. 20 A limitation of our study is that variations in the diagnostic characteristics for the Covid-19 testing methods that were used in our cohort may have led to misclassification of Covid-19 status. The true sensitivity of testing remains unknown. Some patients in the cohort underwent multiple tests, which increased the likelihood of identifying disease. At this time, many persons with possible Covid-19 in New York City and elsewhere are not tested, particularly those who are not hospitalized. Thus, our study may include an overestimation of the proportion of cases of severe Covid-19. That said, it is unlikely that reduced access to testing would add systematic bias in assessment of the relation between use of antihypertensive medications and Covid-19.",
