Hudson more than one century ago [13, 14] and by Anderson Gray McKendrick and William Ogilvy Kermack ten years later [9, 10] . This class of models shares several characteristics with models of population dynamics and with conceptual lumped models in hydrology. These models simulate the temporal evolution of some compartments of the population, which is normally subdivided among Susceptibles (i.e., those persons who have not yet been affected by the virus and which could be subject to infection), Infected (i.e., those persons who have been infected by the virus) and Recovered (i.e., those persons who have recovered, after having been infected). For this reason these models are usually referred to as SIR models. They are based on simple laws to describe the transfer of individuals from one class to the others.",

The general behavior shows an exponential increase in the number of infected persons (notice that the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale) followed by an exponential decrease but with a longer characteristic time. The number of deaths obviously decreases if \u03c1 increases and in particular, we have three different situations for the three runs: (a) for the smallest value of \u03c1, the curve of susceptible persons dramatically decreases from some days before the peak of infections and reaches very small values after few weeks; (b) for the intermediate value of \u03c1, the chosen values of model parameters yield a stationary conditions after about 8 months from the start of the epidemic for the number of susceptible and dead people, which reach almost the same value; (c) for the highest value of \u03c1, the number of susceptible people decreases with time, but remains consistent. Notice that, for this test case, the reduction of the total population is limited, less than 10%, and after one year almost all the living population is recovered. It is important to stress that this test case has the goal of showing how the model can predict different behavior and these results should not be considered as a forecast of the actual behavior of any real pandemic. SIR models are sometimes applied using the ratio of the number of individuals in each category with respect to the total population as a variable. Even if test case 1 showed that for three sets of model parameters, which differ only for the value of \u03c1, the total population shows only a limited variation, nevertheless, the term used to compute the infection rate introduces a non-linearity in the model. Therefore test case 2 is designed to assess the effect of P 0 on model results. Figure 3 as functions of the normalized quantities versus time. The values of each function at the end of the simulation period are very similar. The main differences are in the evolving phase, for which the response of a small population appears to be more rapid than that of a large population. Roughly speaking, the curves corresponding to high populations show a delay with respect to the curve for the smallest population of about 15 days per an increase in P 0 by an order of magnitude. This remark, if confirmed by runs with more reliable parameter sets, could have fundamental consequences in the design of early warning systems.",
