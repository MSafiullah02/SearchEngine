            "text": "Background: The concerns of the highly contagious and morbid nature of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-2019) have prompted healthcare workers to implement strict droplet and contact isolation precautions. Unfortunately, some patients who may be or presumptively or confirmed as infected with COVID-2019 may also require emergent surgical procedures. As such, given the high-risk for exposure of many healthcare workers involved the complex requirements for appropriate isolation must be adhered to. Case presentation: We present our experience with a 77-year-old who required emergency cardiac surgery for a presumed acute aortic syndrome in the setting of a presumed, and eventually confirmed, COVID-2019 infection. We outline the necessary steps to maintain strict isolation precautions to limit potential exposure to the surgical Team. Conclusions: We hereby provide our algorithm for emergent surgical procedures in critically-ill patients with presumptive or confirmed infection with COVID-2019. The insights from this case report can potentially be templated to other facilities in order to uphold high standards of infection prevention and patient safety in surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Nevertheless, as the number of positive cases continue to growwith the associated morbidity and mortality, it is critical to control further spread via implementation and strict compliance with isolation precautions, as healthcare workers and other patients are at significant risk for exposure [2] . SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen that is spread predominately through large droplets and contact (i.e. fomites such as surfaces) transmission [3] . As such, respiratory and contact isolation precautions are paramount in limiting further exposure. Because of the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its case fatality rate, much of which is still under investigation, additional precautions are recommended beyond what is typically used for limiting the spread of routine respiratory pathogens [4] . Unfortunately, as the numbers of cases increase, some of the presumptively infected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients will present with concomitant problems that might require surgical intervention.",

He experienced a fall at home and presented to a local emergency room with a questionable loss of consciousness and fever. Because of the high rate of community acquired infections in the area of the local emergency room, a complete COVID-2019 workup that included a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest was obtained. The CT scan demonstrated characteristic ground glass opacities which have been associated with COVID-2019. Additionally, there was concern of an intramural hematoma and an acute ascending aortic dissection could not be ruled out. He was transferred to our institution for further management. Due to the concerning CT report and lack of availability of the images, the CT scan was repeated with specific heart-rate gating and contrast bolus administration focusing on his aortic pathology. Again, an ascending aortic hematoma was visualized, and a Type A aortic dissection could not be ruled out (Fig. 1) . Given the findings of pulmonary infiltrates, upon admission, he was placed in strict droplet and contact precautions in a negative air-flow Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room as a potential COVID-2019 case. Testing had been obtained prior to transfer. Given his presentation and presumed acute aortic syndrome, and after a multi-disciplinary discussion and shared decision making of the risks and benefits with the patient and his son, it was determined that he should undergo emergent cardiac surgical intervention. Again, because of the risk of exposure, a confirmatory transesophageal echocardiogram was deferred until he was in the operating room. Because of his presumed COVID-2019 infection, we established the following protocol to limit potential HCF spread:",
