For inpatient surgery, the need for anesthesiologist and other healthcare input in addition to the technical equipment side cannot be sustained at present in several EU countries. For outpatient and day case surgery, even if performed under local anesthesia, the number of patients displaced and the risk of in-hospital infection make it difficult to justify. Thus, the focus of any hernia surgery at this time is largely the management of the emergency hernia, and also managing the current hernia waiting list and patients with a new hernia diagnosis. This is discussed in more detail.",
