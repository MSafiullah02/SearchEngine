More recently, some outbreaks due to the ingestion of contaminated food or drink have been reported.27, 28, 29\n",

However, this situation is associated with a worse prognosis and frequent reactivation of HBV, leading to graft loss. In endemic countries, such as Italy, Greece, China, and Taiwan, blood donors are screened by the HBsAg test because the prevalence of a high anti-HBc titer would considerably affect the pool of available donors. Other countries such as the United States, Germany, and Brazil use both HBV markers for screening. More recently, NAT was extended to HBV-DNA and incorporated in a multiplex format to HCV and HIV NAT platforms. NAT not only identifies donors on the HBV window period but also interdicts donations regarded as having occult B infection (OBI), thus deeming individuals negative for HBsAg but harboring HBV-DNA as potentially infectious. OBI is common in areas where HBV is endemic and is responsible for the few transfusional cases verified before the introduction of NAT. The current risk of TT HBV in the United States, where 3 parallel tests are performed (NAT, anti-HBc, and HBsAg), is estimated as greater than 1:500,000.

Consequently, the actual incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with dengue and its complications are difficult to estimate.",
