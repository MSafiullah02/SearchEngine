            "text": "The practice of public health seeks to understand the causes of disease, to predict and prevent where possible and otherwise to diagnose early and treat effectively so that morbidity, disability and death are minimized. Over the last 150 years, the development of powerful epidemiological tools to look at disease in populations has led to the identification of many causal risk factors for disease and provided the basis for disease prevention and health promotion programmes. In the 19th century, huge improvements in population health were made possible through knowledge and action on environmental factors such as poor housing or unclean water supplies. Last century public health programmes were largely aimed at the major lifestyle factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and poor nutrition that lay behind common chronic diseases; and vaccines were developed to prevent infectious diseases. In the last two decades or so, it has been recognized that knowledge of genomics and the application of new technologies can also contribute to the public health armamentarium through providing molecular insights into disease risk and pathology. Though initially work was mainly focused on genetics, namely the diagnosis and care of patients and families with inherited (or heritable) disorders, wider knowledge of the entire genome has enabled sub-populations at risk to be defined through a range of genomic characteristics or variations as well as by different exposures or lifestyles. Individuals with disease can also be grouped according to genomic factors associated with particular pathology or likely response to treatment. Similarly, pathogen genomics allows identification of genes responsible for characteristics such as antibiotic resistance or increased virulence, which can aid clinical management. Such new capabilities have increasingly enabled the practice of personalized prevention and health care.2",

Notably, genetic testing has enabled major developments in the stages of disease at which screening may be offered. Genetic carrier testing now provides the means of identifying couples at risk of having offspring with serious medical conditions such as sickle cell disease at the preconception stage by identifying those where both partners are carriers of recessive variants; antenatal genetic testing can identify affected foetuses for conditions such as Down syndrome. Screening of newborns via the \u2018heel prick\u2019 test can identify babies who are at risk of life-limiting diseases such as phenylketonuria (PKU), most of which are heritable in origin. Antenatal and newborn screening are firmly embedded in national screening programmes in the UK. However, the opportunities for carrier screening mainly present for ethnic minority populations such as those of Ashkenazi Jewish origin who are at higher risk of rare genetic disorders such as Tay Sachs disease,5 or for populations with high levels of consanguinity such as the Pakistani communities who are at higher risk for a range of autosomal recessive disorders.6 Systematic population approaches to carrier screening, such as the programme in New York for disorders which are common in Jewish communities,7 have been highly successful in reducing disease in these populations.",

At present, genetic screening for this group of conditions is only recommended in certain circumstances (for example, cascade testing from known cases (Lynch syndrome and FH) or testing for women at high risk, because of their family history).12 Caution is urged before expanding use of such tests to people at \u2018population-level\u2019 risk, because the positive predictive value of any variants found would be much lower, and they would be harder to interpret.",

After much debate and a 2-year pilot programme, a further four conditions will be added in England from November 2014. However, further pressure to expand programmes will undoubtedly arise as a result of such powerful new genomic technologies that enable faster, cheaper and safer examination of the genome and the possibility of looking for many conditions at once (Table 2). Public health professionals will have an important role to play in this decision-making but, to do so they will need sufficient understanding of these new genomic technologies, the underlying science and the relationship of molecular pathologies to the diseases are in question.

Characteristically, modelling shows that the risk of disease is double the population average in the 5% of the population at highest risk. This leads to the possibility for preventive public health that genetic testing could enable the population to be stratified by risk and preventive interventions targeted accordingly. For example, stratification of breast cancer risk may enable mammography to be offered earlier or more frequently to those at higher risk and less frequently, at a later age, or not at all to those at lower risk. Such strategies offering more intensive primary or secondary prevention interventions to those at greater genomic risk will become increasingly important in public health programmes that seek to maximize benefit while minimizing inconvenience or even harm and providing cost-effective services.22",

The use of molecular and genomic approaches to study infectious disease aetiology, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment has recently substantially increased.23 New sequencing technologies applied to pathogen genomes have multiple uses in the area of infectious disease, including surveillance, investigating transmission and understanding pathogenesis. Relatively cheap sequencing of pathogen genomes allows rapid characterization of microorganisms, identification of key virulence factors and antibiotic resistance profile (useful in determining the best treatment options for a given patient), monitoring the spread of antibiotic resistant strains and detection, mapping and analysis of outbreaks. It has already been used to identify the probable sources of both hospital- and community-based disease outbreaks.",

For example, based on a phylogenetic tree constructed using whole-genome sequences from clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Harris et al.24 identified instances of probable international spread and also estimated that the responsible MRSA clonal lineage (ST239) emerged in the mid-to-late 1960s, a date which was consistent with the timing of increased antibiotic usage and the first detection of MRSA in Europe. Vaccine escape mutants have been identified through phylogenetic analysis of isolates of the PMEN1 clone of Streptococcus pneumoniae; recent (2005\u201307) isolates from the USA were distinct from older USA isolates, implying that the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000 had changed the population distribution of the organism.25 Genome sequencing can also provide baseline data before the introduction of a vaccination programme, allowing prospective evaluation of potential changes in epidemiology.26",

It has potential uses in investigating both small clusters and larger outbreaks of infection, providing timely information on evolutionary origin, route of transmission, pathogenic potential and drug resistance (if genes and/or gene variants influencing these characteristics are known). Comparing the genome sequences of pathogens isolated from different hosts can aid in inferring patterns of transmission when considered together with epidemiological data. Although the identification of two identical strains cannot prove that two cases are epidemiologically linked, putative chains of transmission can be ruled out if the infecting strains are found to be different. Genome sequencing has been used in a variety of outbreak investigations to establish likely networks of transmission and explain the mechanism of spread through a population, e.g. transmission of MRSA within and between hospital units and the community,27 persistence of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a ventilator despite thorough cleaning28 and identifying potential superspreaders.29 It has also been used to identify likely camel-to-human transmission of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.30 For animal health, WGS of pathogens isolated from different animal hosts can help to elucidate the transmission dynamics within and between species, e.g. the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between cattle and between badgers and cattle.31",

For example, the structure of the phylogenetic tree in relation to drug resistance, constructed for M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Russia, suggested that resistance to fluoroquinolones and pyrazinamide was acquired during infection rather than pre-existing in the infecting strain; this in turn suggested that strains resistant to these antibiotics might be less transmissible than susceptible strains.34",

The burden of disease in developing countries from preventable birth defects prompted the World Health Assembly in 2010 to declare this as a significant problem and urged them to take action. However, many barriers to such action exist, including difficulties in persuading senior policymakers to recognize the potential of genomics, and the lack of genetic expertise and service provision available for these very large, poor populations. One tool that enables policymakers to make a rapid assessment of need in their own country and develop policy options around birth defects was developed by an international group led by the PHG Foundation in Cambridge.39 For pathogens, it is unlikely that whole-genome sequencing would play a major role in routine clinical practice in the developing world but molecular testing technologies such as Xpert,40 which detects genetic variants that confer rifampicin resistance in M tuberculosis, are now widely used in some developing countries.",
