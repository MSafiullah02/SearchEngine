In the aftermath of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic and the continuing threats of avian A(H5N1) infections and other emergent respiratory virus infections such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), the purpose of the meeting was to address the many gaps in our understanding of pathogenesis and clinical management of severe influenza and other respiratory virus infections. The meeting was comprised of both invited state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art lectures, a number of which are the subject of detailed summaries in this supplement, and of oral and poster abstract presentations of new data. The following summary highlights some of the key points made during the meeting.

Increased surveillance in various countries in South\u2010East/East Asia continues to provide more information on factors affecting the epidemiology, demographics and seasonality of influenza and other respiratory infections, as well as the role the region plays in the global dynamics of influenza evolution and epidemiology.

In response to human cases of avian A(H5N1) influenza and the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, a series of \u2018emergency\u2019 and \u2018interim\u2019 guidelines were published. More recently, these are being consolidated, incorporating extensive review of existing literature, to produce a comprehensive WHO standard guideline on clinical management of severe influenza disease, in preparation for future emergencies. The broad scope encompasses as follows: treatment for severe influenza, for example viral pneumonia, ARDS, multiple organ failure, septic shock; pharmacological interventions for treatment, including anti\u2010influenza drugs, anti\u2010inflammatory drugs and adjunctive therapies; non\u2010pharmacological clinical interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, oxygen and fluid management; and prevention of severe influenza in patients at higher risk of progression to severe disease. To facilitate the collection of the knowledge needed to address key questions associated with the prevention and treatment for the full spectrum of respiratory viral infections, the WHO is also spearheading a public health research agenda for influenza called the Battle Against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative.1 The associated research agenda has been recently posted on the WHO website (http://www.who.int/influenza/patient_care/clinical/brave/en/).",

The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus appears to be better able to replicate in the lower airway, which may partly explain the higher incidence of pneumonia.18 The virulence of viruses is a multigenic property and results from the complex interplay between various virus factors and host components. For example, the influenza viral polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, virus RNA) has been shown to associate with a network of more than 300 human host proteins. Functional genomics (RNAi) approaches allow the study of how these host factors regulate virus RNA synthesis, induction of innate immune responses and adaptation to human cells. A number of the cellular proteins with different activities were shown to modulate polymerase activity and some RNA\u2010binding proteins, including the DEAD\u2010box RNA helicase 17 (DDX17), also governed A(H5N1) polymerase activity and efficient infection of human or chicken cells according to the species\u2010specificity determinant residue 627 of PB2.19 Thus, this network of virus polymerase\u2013host protein interactions in part controls adaptation, replication and pathogenicity of A(H5N1) viruses in humans.

Rapid antigen\u2010based and in particular nucleic acid\u2010based tests are largely replacing culture\u2010based methods. qPCR or chip\u2010based microarrays are particularly adept at multiplex screening for a wide variety of organisms, but may be limited by mutations emerging through evolution or emergence of novel variants. At one end of the spectrum of complexity, the PathChip system, which can amplify \u2018all\u2019 viruses and bacteria, whatever their genetic diversity, and automatically detect the presence of any of 50 000 virus and 20 000 bacteria genomes in a single test of a clinical sample, was described. In one trial of more than 250 samples, comparing its performance with other multiplex respiratory diagnosis platforms and cell culture, the chip achieved an average specificity of 98% and average sensitivity of 83% for 11 groups of viruses, with an average negative predictive value of 98%. Such wide ranging tests also have applications in molecular epidemiology and virus discovery. At the other end of the spectrum, there is the need for simple, cost\u2010effective and highly sensitive methods for rapid detection of human A(H5N1) infection. An \u2018RT\u2010SmartAmp\u2019 assay has been developed that combines both reverse transcriptase (RT) and isothermal DNA amplification reactions in a single step, thereby avoiding RNA extraction and PCR reaction.21 It provides a practical tool, which is highly sensitive for A(H5N1) (lower limit of detection of ~50 copies of virus RNA) with no cross\u2010reaction with seasonal A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) or B\u2010type viruses.

The frequency of resistance was significantly lower in older age groups (approximately 1%). Furthermore, the frequency of cases shedding resistant virus was higher in 2011 than in the previous 2 years, despite a similar numbers of patients being enrolled over the 3\u2010year period. Viral shedding was more prolonged in oseltamivir\u2010treated patients shedding the H275Y variant than in those infected with an oseltamivir\u2010sensitive virus, demonstrating the reduced effectiveness of oseltamivir against the variant strain. Infection with a H275Y variant was detected in two Dutch travellers returning from vacation in Spain, both of whom had not been treated with oseltamivir.25 These oseltamivir\u2010resistant strains also contained the three potentially \u2018permissive\u2019 NA mutations, V241I, N369K and N386S, suggested to facilitate the spread of resistant virus in a community cluster in Australia in 2011. New insights into the mechanism of oseltamivir resistance conferred by a I223R substitution in NA of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were provided by crystallographic analysis of the NA, which demonstrated that the I223R substitution causes a narrowing of a region of the enzymatic site which results in a greater reduction in oseltamivir than zanamivir binding.26 In immune\u2010compromised mice continually infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, oseltamivir treatment selected for variants with a H275Y NA mutation, while laninamivir treatment selected for variants with E119G and R152K NA mutations.

Substitutions in residue 222 increased affinity for substrate in both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5N1) viruses, while the effects of changes in residue 344 varied depending on the amino acid substitution and the NA sequence. Three potentially \u2018permissive\u2019 substitutions in NA of the cluster of oseltamivir\u2010resistant A(H1N1)pdm09(H275Y) viruses detected in Australia in 2011 were investigated in a ferret model for their effects on virus replication and transmission.

The mechanism of action has been attributed to stimulation of innate immunity via interferon\u2010stimulated pathways, as well as a direct effect on inhibiting HA maturation during virus replication.30 A phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated that a 600 mg dose bid for 5 days significantly reduced symptom duration and virus load compared with placebo, with minimal adverse events reported.

Two ferret models were utilized to investigate the role of IVIG on A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5N1) infection.

A single dose of IVIG prevented mortality and significant morbidity following challenge with a lethal dose of A(H5N1) virus; the level of virus replicating in the lung correlated with the dose of IVIG.

Mab CR6261, which binds to the stalk of all group 1 HAs, outperformed oseltamivir when given to mice 2 days post A(H5N1) infection (0% versus 88% mortality, respectively) and was shown still to be effective when given 5 days post\u2010infection with A/WSN/33(H1N1)34, and was effective, when used prophylactically and therapeutically, in protecting ferrets against lethal A(H5N1) infection.35 Mab CR8020, which binds to the stalk of all group 2 HAs,36 prevented infection and was effective in treating mice up to 3 days after infection with A/HK/68(H3N2).
