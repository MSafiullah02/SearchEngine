Until 1999, there had been many different ways to link metadata to Web documents, for example, using META tags in HTML or using PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) for self-and third-party descriptions of information. Although PICS was developed primarily with description and rating adult Web sites in mind, a vocabulary to describe and \"label\" health Web sites was developed in 1997 [11, 12] . The W3C subsequently unified different approaches and the result of these efforts is the Resource Description Framework (RDF)-the current standard based on XML (extensible Markup Language) to transport metadata and a major pillar of the Semantic Web [13] [14] [15] . One feature of RDF is that (other than, for example, the HTML META-tag) it allows people to describe concepts and resources other than a Web document. In contrast, by using the HTML META-tag and a set of keywords the developer implicitly makes a statement about the document or Web site (but often it is not even clear whether the keywords refer to the document or the entire Web site), but cannot make more broad statements, for example, about other resources or concepts, as with RDF. Further, RDF provides a mechanism for giving unambiguous meanings to metadata keywords. In contrast, keywords used in META tags are essentially just ambiguous \"words\" that have no meaning (semantics) for software as they are not linked to other concepts. Words can be ambiguous in that they may have different meanings. For example, the word \"virus\" can refer to a computer virus or a biological virus. RDF provides a mechanism to define what kind of \"virus\" is meant by referring to the RDF statement or site where this concept is defined [again, through its relationship to other concepts, for example \"virus (as defined in this statement) is-a software,\" linking the word software again to another RDF document on the Web that defines \"software,\" etc.], thereby creating \"meaning.\"",

Although RDF is basically an XML file, the difference between an RDF document and a \"plain\" XML document is significant: Whereas XML-Schemas only tell computers (and us) how, for example, an application form for a driver's license looks like, RDF is able to explain to a machine what a driver's license is, by providing the meaning of the concepts used in a driver's license. This is done by providing the relationships of the concepts to other concepts. As the RDF developers point out, RDF is a simple frame system, that is, a format for knowledge representation, where objects (concepts) and their relationships to each other are specified. The RDF specification does not contain a reasoning system; this needs to be built on top of it.",

The MedCERTAIN/MedCIR-CLE projects (explained in detail later) developed some open source tools for health information providers to enter disclosure information deemed ethical (see Chapter 4, this volume) as machine-processable metadata. The health information provider does not need to understand RDF-all he or she needs to do is to fill in a questionnaire for self-disclosure and description, and his or her answers will be translated into metadata [16] . Finally, existing tools for creating knowledge bases, such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000, can be used to create RDF statements [17] , and future Web editors may provide additional functionalities to model knowledge and build knowledge bases.",

The first and most obvious change will include the markedly improved abilities of search engines to conduct accurate and relevant searches on the Web, and to guide users to trusted and relevant health information. Search engines will not only better \"understand\" what a user is looking for, but also what the Web pages they are indexing are about. They can, for example-if a user looks for \"SARS in Canada\"-recognize that the user is likely looking for information on severe acute respiratory syndrome rather than the South African Revenue Service, and then list only those Web sites that contain information about the disease and not the Revenue Service. The results will even include links to relevant Web pages that do not use any of the search terms-for example, if a Web page contains the word SRAS (for syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00e9v\u00e8re), it will be found as well, because the search engine looks for semantic rather than syntactic matches, and the Web crawler has previously \"understood\" the context in which the word has been used and what the Web page on which it appeared is all about.",

Surveys such as the Pew Internet Survey also show that 86% of consumers are concerned about getting low-quality health information on the Web [20] . While empirical studies now provide more than sufficient evidence on the inadequacies of the current Web, there is a surprising lack of debate in the medical world discussing the possibilities of technology to address these problems-presumably as many of the current developments in the field are unknown or remain not understood. The current MedCRICLE Collaboration for Internet Rating, Certification and Labelling of Health Information, a global collaborative network of health information gateways described in detail later, is working toward this aim by enriching the current Web with machine-processable evaluation and trust data.",

The current Web provides an abundance of information, but giving \"information\" to a patient is certainly not enough. The ultimate goal is to enhance \"knowledge\": the information has to be put into context, the concepts have to be explained and defined, and their relationships to other concepts and to personal information (e.g., in the health record) have to be made explicit. This is the difference between \"information\" and \"knowledge.\" The Semantic Web enhances the possibility of supporting \"knowledge translation\" for consumers, the translation of information into knowledge. Doctors who are confronted with \"Web-informed\" patients often complain that patients often find irrelevant information on the Web-information the patient (and the clinician) have to sift through and evaluate, and that is often not applicable to the individual situation [23] . Many patients do not even know the correct names of their diagnoses and are therefore unable to enter the correct terms into search engines. The vision for the future is that people will use their Web-based personal health record as a starting point that may be enriched by all kinds of information gathered by intelligent agents from trusted sources on the Web that are specifically relevant to the patient [24] . For example, if the Web-based health record contains a certain diagnosis, and on the same day the British Medical Journal publishes new research results published about this disease, the agent (which would be a part of the electronic health record software) could automatically generate a link to that article. It doesn't matter if the British Medical Journal article uses a different terminology than the doctor in the health record, as the agent will be able to link the terminologies. The Web-based electronic health record would be a dynamic entry point and knowledge management platform for patient and health professionals alike. Challenges, described in detail elsewhere, include privacy and disintermediation [25] .",

The Semantic Web makes relationships between things explicit and computable, and therefore further increases the transparency for consumers, much as the current Web has already made it easier to compare prices and offers, revolutionizing other areas such as the travel industry. The Semantic Web will make it even easier to compare things, as software can, for example, map different terminologies and aggregate decentralized knowledge dispersed all over the Web. For example, software agents would roam the Web and return information on who has the best offer of a certain car model in a given community. Similarly, software could be used to aggregate experiences of people with all kinds of health services and products, including, for example, their experience with over-thecounter or prescription drugs, hospitals, or individual physicians. While today patients use primarily mailing lists, newsgroups, and chat rooms to exchange anecdotal and narrative information and experiences about health products, services, and providers, patients could publish their experiences about virtually anything and everything in RDF on homepages-from experiences with a new dishwasher to experiences with healthcare professionals, hospitals, or drugs. Patients could rate their treatments and services directly in the Web-based electronic health record and feed them (in anonymized form) into the Semantic Web (e.g., hospitals and doctors provide RDF dumps of their patients on their sites), so that agents can aggregate this information. Such \"knowledge\" evolving on the Web could also be used systematically for postmarketing surveillance efforts to monitor the ongoing safety of marketed drugs on a global scale.",

A \"Collaboration for Critical Appraisal of Health Information on the Web\"-a loose community of health information providers and health gateways using metadata to describe and annotate health Web sites-had been proposed as early as in 1997, and mentioned in two seminal articles in 1998 and 1999 [5, 12] . Today, such a collaboration is known as the MedCIRCLE Collaboration, a loose nonprofit umbrella organization for health information gateways and health Web sites, inspired by the model of the Cochrane Collaboration. Membership is open to any organization using a standardized metadata vocabulary to express evaluative and descriptive statements about health information resources. The basic idea is that quality management on the Web should be based on a collaborative model with many actors (including health professionals and consumers) being able to say different things about anything in a machine-processable way (i.e., using metadata). This would enable software to analyze the trust relationships and would enable \"downstream filtering\" at the client computer or positive selection of trusted content using agents, instead of relying on upstream filtering approaches such as kitemarks [5] or even such well-intended but misguided proposals for (ab-)using top-level domains to centrally approve health information providers [29] . It would also allow search engines to rank their results according to quality and trust criteria of the individual user.",

The MedPICS proposal later led to the MedCERTAIN (2000 MedCERTAIN ( -2001 and MedCIRCLE (2002 MedCIRCLE ( -2003 projects, both of which aimed to implement such metadata on health Web sites and third-party organizations. With the PICS standard being superseded by XML/RDF [13] , the projects became early \"Semantic Web\" projects, using RDF to transport and exchange metadata. As the PICS standard became obsolete, MedPICS was renamed into HIDDEL (Health Information Disclosure, Description and Evaluation Language) [16] . Unlike other initiatives in this field, such as Health on the Net Foundation (HON), Centre for Health Information Quality kitemark (CHiQ), URAC Health Web Site Accreditation program, MedCERTAIN is not a traditional \"kitemark\" (i.e., seal of approval) project, but instead tried to develop an infrastructure and common ontology to link existing approaches, to make them interoperable, and to generate a critical mass of healthrelated descriptive and evaluative metadata on the Web. Unfortunately, the ideas behind MedCERTAIN/MedCIRCLE are not easy to communicate and the projects were consistently and repeatedly misunderstood and misrepresented as a \"kitemarking\" or third-party certification program [30] , while the main goal-to develop and demonstrate a decentralized Web-of-trust infrastructure using of metadata-were not widely understood.",

The Collaboration involves a wider medical community to assess health information, demonstrating the power of collaborative and interoperable evaluations in a Semantic Web environment. Figure 18 .1 illustrates the operational model of health information providers collaborating in the MedCIRCLE. MedCIRCLE members are primarily trusted health information gateways, government portals, medical societies, accrediting organizations, and libraries. What they have in common is that all are \"third parties\" that are in the business of describing, annotating, or making statements about other organizations, health information providers, or consumer health Web sites. For example, a medical society offering \"recommended links for consumers\" is a \"gateway.\" Rather than offering unspecific hyperlinks to \"recommended sites,\" the gateway can semantically enrich the endorsements by using a standardized vocabulary HIDDEL (Health Information Disclosure, Description and Evaluation Language) [16] , expressed in XML/RDF, to report evaluation results in detail. Similarly, an organization in the business of \"accrediting\" health Web sites would use the vocabulary to express accreditation results. Among the current MedCIRCLE members are, for example, three major European gateway sites for consumer health information, two of which are backed by official professional physician associations. Other health subject gateways, accreditation, or rating services are encouraged to join the Collaboration simply by implementing HIDDEL on their gateways. The hope is to eventually establish a global Web of trust for networked health information.",

Nobel laureate economist Herbert A. Simon (quoted in Coiera's paper on \"information economics\" [32] ) once stated that \"Information consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.\" One of the central topics of consumer health informatics is how to guide consumers to quality health information. Technology for producing and distributing information is useless without some way to locate, filter, organize, and summarize it. In that sense the Semantic Web remains a double-edged sword. The main opportunities lie in the fact that consumers will have even better possibilities to find, aggregate, and appraise health information than today. On the other hand, one might fear that this may lead to a further overreliance on external information, a process of disintermediation between patients and healthcare professionals, and erosion of the patient-physician relationship. Such concerns may not, however, stop the development of the Semantic Web, as the possibilities for e-commerce can be mindboggling, in that search engines such as Google may evolve into marketplace managers and personal assistants to find, buy, and sell articles on the Web [33] . As health infor-mation is still some of the most sought after content on the Web, constituting of about 4.5% of all queries in search engines [34] , people will not stop short of using these technologies for health products and services, researching the attributes and reputation of health products and services with a far greater sophistication than on today's Web. The World Wide Web as it exists today might be just the beginning of yet another consumer health informatics revolution.",
