The nanoparticles did not aggregate even after several weeks based on our experience. When the aqueous ferrofluid was treated with the W/O microemulsion in the presence of a mixture of tetraethoxysilane, N-(\u03b2-ethylenamine)-\u03b3-propylamine triethoxylsilane and ammonia (28\u201330%, w/w), the magnetite core was covered by silica shell and increased the nanoparticle size up to 40 \u00b1 5 nm (Fig. 1b). The prepared nanoparticles appeared to be homogenous with good dispersion. This sample was also examined by AFM, and the diameter was in good agreement with the result obtained from TEM. Both aqueous magnetic ferrofluid and amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles have magnetic property. Amino functional groups on the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles are important for the further modification of the magnetic nanoparticles. A significant enhancement in fluorescence of the fluorescamine solution after incubation with the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles suspension was observed in the fluorescamine tests.

The fluorescence of the target ssDNA(I) solution obviously decreased after it was incubated with the capture ssDNA(I)-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3\n. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the dissociated target ssDNA(I) solution increased gradually when the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate was denaturalized at a different temperature, as shown in Fig. 4\n. After denaturalization at 95 \u00b0C, for about 10 min, the fluorescence intensity of the dissociated target ssDNA was almost the same as that of the initial target ssDNA(I) solution (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the target ssDNA(I) can be recovered from solution by this method and dissociated from magnetic DNA bio-conjugate, which can be used for further research. The fluorescence microscopy imaging of the nanoparticles also showed that the capture ssDNA(I)-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles displayed intensive fluorescence after it was incubated with the fluorescence-labeled target ssDNA(I) and separated under the magnet field. After the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate was denatured in 95 \u00b0C water bath for 10 min and washed for several times, the fluorescence on the separated magnetic DNA bio-conjugate disappeared due to the release of the fluorescence-labeled target ssDNA(I) from the nanoparticles. In contrast, the control experiment with only streptavidin-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles did not show any fluorescence after it was incubated with the fluorescence-labeled target ssDNA(I) and separated under the magnet field (Fig. 5\n). The results demonstrated that the target ssDNA(I) could be easily recovered from the solution by using the capture ssDNA(I)-modified amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles. It became clear that the existence of capture ssDNA(I) on the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticle was the major cause of the target ssDNA(I) recovery. Therefore, this method can be widely used to recover different target ssDNA when amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles is modified with different capture ssDNA.",
