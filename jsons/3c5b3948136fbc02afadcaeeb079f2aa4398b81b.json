However, the association between WU/KI polyomaviruses and human disease has remained unclear. In this study, the prevalence of these two novel viruses and occurrence of co-infection with other respiratory viruses were determined in Thai pediatric patients with respiratory disease. Previously described PCR assays were applied to detect WU/KI polyomaviruses as well as other respiratory viruses in 302 nasopharyngeal suction specimens collected from February 2006 through February 2007. The results revealed the anneal prevalence of WU and KI polyomaviruses in the Thai population was 6.29% and 1.99%, respectively. The frequency of co-detection of WU and KI polyomaviruses with other respiratory viral pathogens was 42.11% and 33.33%, respectively. Moreover, each of the two complete genome sequences of WU (CU 295 and CU 302) and KI (CU 255 and CU 258) polyomaviruses were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Sequence analysis showed that they contained features common to those found in previous studies. However, there were several nucleotide variations within the non-coding regulatory regions and various non-synonymous mutations within the coding regions which may influence virulence and pathogenesis of these viruses. Nevertheless, it is still possible that these viruses are not the causative agents of clinical respiratory disease. Therefore, judging the association of WU/KI polyomavirus infections with a particular disease will be challenging and require more comprehensive case control investigations.",

They are non-enveloped icosahedral particles containing a circular dou-ble stranded DNA genome of approximately 5000 base pairs in length. They can infect a number of hosts of various species such as birds, rodents and primates. Four distinct polyomaviruses -JC (John Cunningham) virus, BK virus, KI (Karolinska Institute) virus and WU (Washington University) virus -have been reported to infect humans. Both JC virus and BK virus were discovered in 1971 (Gardner et al., 1971 and Padgett et al., 1971) and are genetically closely related to each other. They usually cause asymptomatic infections; yet, they can become oncogenic or induce disease in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients (Khalili et al., 2006; Hirsch et al., 2006; Fioriti et al., 2005) .",

The prevalence of WU polyomavirus in Thailand (6.29%) was higher than that reported in Australia (4.5%) (Bialasiewicz et al., 2008) , the United States (1.2%) (Gaynor et al., 2007) and United Kingdom (1%) (Norja et al., 2007) but comparable to the prevalence reported in a previous study from South Korea (7%) (Han et al., 2007) . This may be due to particular racial predispositions or different geographical distributions of the virus. In contrast, the incidence of KI polyomavirus infection in Thailand (1.99%) was comparable to that established in Sweden (1%) (Allander et al., 2007) , Australia (2.6%) (Bialasiewicz et al., 2008) and the United Kingdom (1.4%) (Norja et al., 2007) .",

These two regions are separated by a regulatory non-coding region that contains typical polyomavirus characteristics (Allander et al., 2007 and Gaynor et al., 2007) . Based on complete genome analysis, the WU/KI polyomaviruses isolated from Thai patients were closely related to the isolates described in previous reports (Gaynor et al., 2007; Allander et al., 2007 and Bialasiewicz et al., 2007) . This may be due to the fact that both WU and KI polyomaviruses are DNA viruses which are less error prone in the DNA replication process. However, there were numerous nucleotide variations within the non-coding regulatory regions as well as several non-synonymous mutations within coding regions.",

However, these viruses may not be the causative agents of clinical respiratory disease and their presence in the respiratory tract may simply reflect their mode of transmission similar to other polyomaviruses in humans such as JCV and BKV. Nevertheless, most known human viruses are pathogenic in certain conditions and thus, novel viruses must be considered as potential pathogens. Various degrees of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to mild and severe illness depend on several factors, such as the host's immune status and age, the virus strain, viral load and mode of transmission. The 10-nucleotide insertion and several nucleotide sequence variations within non-coding regulatory regions as well as various non-synonymous mutations within the coding regions should be taken into consideration as factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of these novel viruses. The difficulty with persisting viruses is that they are often discovered out their symptomatic context, so that judging the association of WU/KI polyomavirus infections with a particular disease will be challenging and require further extensive case control investigations.",
