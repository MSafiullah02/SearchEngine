In the modern era, physicians have helped patients face the influenza pandemics of 1918, the 1950s, the 1960s, and 2009; HIV/ AIDS (1980s and beyond); severe acute respiratory syndrome (2002); and Middle East respiratory syndrome (2015) . Physicians cannot do it alone: Institutions must support their efforts (and have a responsibility to provide protection from occupational exposures). Longstanding principles of medical ethics should guide the profession, individual clinicians, health systems, and our society. They must be reaffirmed in the circumstances of health system catastrophes, during which their application-but not the principles themselvesmay change. These principles include justice; equity; and, fundamentally, the physician's duty to care for all and not discriminate against a class or category of patients (for example, on the basis of age, race, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, social status, or other personal characteristics) (1).",

For some patients (with or without COVID-19), the likelihood of harm is so high and that of benefit so low that resuscitation is not clinically indicated. A blanket approach, however, is not consistent with an individualized, evidencebased, clinical assessment. Clinician health and safety also require attention. Clinicians should not be asked to participate in resuscitation efforts that are not clinically indicated, and policies and procedures should help ensure best practices and availability of personal protective equipment.",

Moreover, the authors cite an article (5) on organ transplantation that they say provides a precedent for rationing based on life-years, but it is misapplied. That article (5) considered age to determine short-term survival of 1 year (that is, clinical effectiveness of the intervention), not longer survival, life expectancy, or life-years. Also, the contexts are very different. Older patients once were believed to be unlikely to survive the procedure itself; they were not denied a transplant because they had too few life-years to be deserving. In fact, transplants for recipients aged 65 years and older have increased dramatically for lungsand overall-over the past 30 years (6).",
