Insights derived from this research may indicate what might be done to influence cross-border trade and investment in both food production and provision so as to foster better health [13]. To be even more effective, those interested in CD control might well lobby for a Deputy U.S. Trade Representative to come from public health and to have a budget that ensures input at every step in the multiyear process. That would mean finding a public health candidate who knows the world of trade negotiation and both economic policy and private industrial investment. This is, of course, unlikely unless public health creates interdisciplinary capacity to produce such leaders. With that larger view, public health should or could exert influence at the level of policy formulation in a vast array of CD-relevant areas such as drug policy and generic categorization, tobacco and e-cigarette regulation, workforce capacity issues, and nutritional content of foods. And, of course, public health also needs to lobby for funding of CDs.",

The depth and breadth of the HIV/AIDS epidemic certainly brought this concept into view, and it now needs to be put forth as a core argument for all public health intervention. Going forward, once a health system attempts to be comprehensive in scope and work toward universal health coverage, it becomes very expensive, even when highly efficient [20]. Such costs should trigger an enhanced interest in CD prevention. To be relevant, public health needs to be there.",

True partnership is difficult and painful in academic settings, where stature is conveyed by the depth of singular expertise. It is perhaps suicidal when funds are distributed on the basis of that singular expertise. Tearing down internal academic walls will take public health leadership. Leadership is always associated with risk and peril; risk is built into the definition of leadership, because true leaders look around corners. You cannot look around a corner safely or from the back of a crowd. Public health needs to look around the corner of global development and take the necessary leadership risks.",

It is easy for public policy to ignore a single voice, especially when it is the voice of a technical expert who has not participated in the economic discussions.
