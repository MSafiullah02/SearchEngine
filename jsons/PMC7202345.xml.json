Autoantibodies and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells mediate the anti-platelet response leading to thrombocytopenia. Abnormal immune response against circulating platelet and megakaryocytes results in decreased platelet survival as well as impaired platelet production.1 Frequently, the autoimmune response in children is triggered by previous silent or overt viral infections, vaccinations, or antiviral drugs. Some specific viruses such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus, rubella, and measles are commonly associated with ITP.2,3 Moreover, how new-onset pathogens could affect the immune response and platelet count in pediatric patients with ITP is still unknown.",

Among the confirmed cases, 256.059 are recovered cases, and 67.999 died.5 Although human coronaviruses have been considered harmless for decades, their clinical importance and epidemic possibility were recognized after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Particularly, Covid-19 spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. The median time between exposure and symptoms onset is three days (ranges from 0 to 24 days). Initial symptoms are often fever, cough, and nasal congestion that can progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.6 On the contrary, most infected children have an asymptomatic course or mild clinical manifestations with a good prognosis. Few may evolve into lower respiratory infections. Moreover, gastrointestinal involvement and persistent positive rectal swabs in pediatric patients are recently described.7",

It is widely acknowledged that ITP is a possible secondary manifestation of other hematological and immune disorders characterized by the deficiency of the cellular and/or humoral immune response, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), selective IgA deficiency, and DiGeorge\u2019s syndrome. Additionally, the use of some medications could expose ITP patients to additional risks compared to the general population.1 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic preparation comprising pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) from large numbers of healthy people, could represent a risk of underlying infections. Generally, the risk of getting a viral infection from IVIG is considered exceedingly low. While there is no literature regarding Covid-19 infection and patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of immunosuppression with high dose corticosteroids, rituximab, or other immunosuppressive agents is comparable to other viruses.",

To prevent the spread of the infection, children with ITP should follow good hygiene practices: regular handwashing, try not to touch mouth, nose, or eyes before cleaning hands thoroughly after returning from public places, cover the mouth with napkin or towel when coughing or sneezing, avoid crowded places and contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. In this context, for children affected by ITP, yet limited in recreational and motor activities, alternative strategies must be found to reduce fatigue risk and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To preserve their psychological well-being and reduce their fears, interactive methods based on positive communication should be adopted. Explaining to children preventive strategies could give them a sense of control over the risk of infection, reducing their anxiety. Regularizing daily rhythms and habits can play a crucial role in making children fearless and healthy.",
