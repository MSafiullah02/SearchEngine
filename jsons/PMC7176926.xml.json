This suggests a different viral evolution from SARS and MERS, involving bats as a wild reservoir [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Genomic comparison between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 has shown that there are only 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses, mostly concentrated in the non-structural protein genes, while 27 mutations have been found in genes encoding the viral spike protein S responsible for receptor binding and cell entry [8]. These mutations might explain the apparent lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV, but further studies are required [9].",

It is well established that SARS-CoV emerged as a human pathogen thanks to favourable mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein which increased its pathogenicity by strengthening its affinity with the receptor; it is therefore assumed that SARS-CoV-2 has behaved in a similar way [14]. However, in SARS-CoV-2 no amino acid substitutions were present in the RBD that directly interacts with human receptor ACE2 compared with SARS-CoV, but six mutations occurred in other regions of the RBD [8]. The role of such substitutions on the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 must be further investigated. Analysis of receptor affinity shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 more efficiently than the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV, although less efficiently than the 2002 strain [14]. Moreover, it has been predicted that a single nucleotide mutation on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, if it occurs, could further increase its pathogenicity [14].",

Inoculation of the 2019 nCoV onto surface layers of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects and cessation of the cilia movements [16]. SARS-CoV highly replicates in the type I and II pneumocytes and in enterocytes, and the SARS-induced down-regulation of ACE2 receptors in lung epithelium contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and subsequent ARDS [15,17]. Whether the higher receptor affinity for ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV could lead to a more severe lung involvement in COVID-19 than in SARS requires further investigation.",

However, it must be noted that some published studies have estimated an R0 for SARS reaching the value of 4 [23]. Interestingly, a recent review by Liu and colleagues has shown that the average reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 3.28, with a median value of 2.79, thus exceeding the WHO estimates [24]. Nonetheless, in Table 1 we report only the WHO data, since the estimation of R0 depends on the estimation method used, and the current estimate can be biased by insufficient data and the short onset times of the diseases, as Liu and colleagues also state.",

Interestingly, according to the CCDC, the case fatality rate in the Hubei province, where the epidemic started, is seven-fold higher than in other provinces [25]. This could be related to the fact that, among the 44 672 cases reported by the CCDC, 10 567 cases (14.6%) were diagnosed only clinically and exclusively in the Hubei province. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that clinically diagnosed cases presented with a more severe clinical picture, thus increasing the case fatality rate [25]. After the change of the case definition, the number of cases increased due to the inclusion of cases cumulated over the previous weeks. The question is: were mild cases registered at all? It is not a minor matter, because including mild cases will reduce the mortality rate. Indeed, the number of infected cases outside of China is currently 24 727, with 484 fatal outcomes, a mortality rate of 1.9% [1]. Of interest, the fatality rate of the novel coronavirus infection increases to an estimated 14% when considering only the hospitalized cases, reaching the overall SARS case-fatality rate that was estimated to be around 15% [26,27].",

In Table 2\nthe main clinical characteristics from the three most significant case series of COVID-19 cases are listed and compared with the most recently available data about SARS and MERS. The median age of the COVID-19 cases ranges from 49 to 57 years (similar to SARS and MERS), higher in those admitted to the ICU; up to 50% of patients reported a chronic comorbid illness in a slightly lower percentage compared to patients diagnosed with MERS. The most common presenting symptom is fever, followed by cough, sore throat and dyspnoea; all of the infected patients had at least one of these symptoms. However, according to the CCDC report, 81% of the cases had mild symptoms and 1.2% were asymptomatic [25].",

These findings are in line with SARS percentages, while the clinical course of MERS seems to be characterized by a more frequent development of ARDS and the need for invasive life support, especially in elderly patients and smokers [36]. In particular, acute kidney injury (AKI), which rarely occurs in SARS and COVID-19, seems to be a peculiar complication of MERS. Although this could be explained by a direct renal cytopathic effect induced by the virus, since DDP4 receptors are largely represented in tubules and glomeruli, it seems more probable that the high percentage of AKI reported is due to multiorgan failure, which occurs more frequently in MERS than in the other coronavirus infections [37].",

            "text": "What are the causes of such different abilities to spread among these three viruses? A first hypothesis is a different viral tropism for the respiratory tract, resulting in a milder but highly transmissible disease when the virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract, and a severe pneumonia with lower spreading potential when the viral tropism is higher for the lower respiratory tract. This hypothesis derives from the example of the influenza viruses, namely seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. They preferably bind \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors of the upper respiratory tract, usually causing a less severe but more transmissible disease than avian influenza H5N1 or H7N9, which preferably bind \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid in the lung alveoli, causing severe pneumonia [38]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use receptors that have been found in both the upper and the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, other human coronaviruses, such as NL63-CoV, cause a mild illness even if they bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [5]. So, in our opinion, it is likely that the different inoculum dose at the time of infection makes the difference in terms of severity of the disease; heavy inoculum exposures seem to be linked to a greater penetration into the lower respiratory tract, causing severe pneumonia, whereas lower inoculum exposures allow viruses to only reach the upper airway, causing a milder infection.",

MERS-CoV has a higher mortality but a lower transmissibility, probably because it causes a more severe clinical picture than COVID-19 and SARS, requiring hospitalization more frequently, thus reducing the community spread of the infection and increasing the nosocomial transmission [5,20]. On the other hand, the apparent higher mortality of MERS could be biased by the fact that most of the data available on MERS were derived from hospitalized patients, thus implicating a more severe clinical picture than community-acquired cases [42]. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that, when the cohort of patients with MERS was derived from the community and not from hospital outbreaks, the mortality rate decreased to 10%, as was observed in a cohort study carried out in 2015 in Saudi Arabia [42].",

            "text": "Interestingly, despite the high virological similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea seem to be much more common in SARS, although the proportion of SARS patients with gastrointestinal symptoms varies among different studies, from 23% to 70% in the Toronto outbreak and in the Hong Kong community outbreak, respectively [41,43]. Such a difference could be related to the fact that the Hong Kong outbreak seemed to originate from a faecal contamination of a residential complex due to a faulty sewage system, while the Toronto outbreak was caused mainly by nosocomial hospital droplet transmission [41,43]. The gastrointestinal route of transmission has also been hypothesized for MERS-CoV through the consumption of infected camel milk; moreover, gastrointestinal transmission has been demonstrated in the animal model through intestinal DPP4 receptors [44]. From this finding, the reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the loose stools of the first US patient with COVID-19 is not surprising [33]. SARS-CoV replicates in the enteric epithelium by binding to the ACE2 receptor, and it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 would behave in the same way [17]. This may contribute to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted via this route; there is also evidence that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remain viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal\u2013oral transmission [45]. In Table 3\nwe provide a synthesis of what is certain about COVID-19 to date and what needs to be further addressed.",
