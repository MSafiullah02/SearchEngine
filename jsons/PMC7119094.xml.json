Herein, we report that tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) at room temperature remarkably accelerates the N9-alkylation of the purine ring with a variety of organic halides. Moreover, these mild reaction conditions and the efficiency of this chemistry permit its use in combinatorial reactions in microtiter plates followed by in situ screening for the discovery of potent sulfotransferase inhibitors.",

This mild condition, if achieved, is ideal for reactions in a microtiter plate for the high-throughput screening against several important enzymes. Initially, we investigated the alkylation reaction of 2,6-dichloropurine with benzyl bromide and methyl iodide. In both cases, the reaction was completed within 10 min upon addition of 2 equiv of the organic halide and 2 equiv of TBAF. The reactions were analyzed by LC\u2013MS and gave a mixture of the two isomers N9/N7 in 7/3 ratio and excellent yields (isolated) (entries 1 and 2, Table 1\n). The reaction proceeded well in different solvents such as THF, DMF, and DMSO, and was carried out in open air. Similar results were obtained with 2-amino-6-chloropurine (entry 4, Table 1). Interestingly, using methyl bromoacetate gave better selectivity with excellent yield. Similarly, we also found that in the case of 1-bromodecane with 2-amino-6-chloropurine a minor amount of the N7-alkylated product was observed; however, the reaction in this case required a longer time for completion (entry 5, Table 1).",

Inhibitor and 4 MUS solutions were diluted to 10\u00d7 the desired final concentration. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO for the studies, and a final assay volume of 200 \u03bcL was used. Enzyme-containing stock solution (100 \u03bcL), inhibitor (20 \u03bcL), and water (40 \u03bcL) were combined in 96-well microplates, mixed, and allowed to remain for 10 min. The reaction was initiated with 4 MUS solution (20 \u03bcL) and production of fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone was followed for 5 min to calculate the rates. Measurements were performed using a Packard Fusion plate reader. Inhibitor concentrations were chosen such that enzymatic rates were linear. For K\ni measurements, inhibitors were studied at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 nM concentrations. The dissociation constants were obtained as the absolute value of the x-axis intercept on plotting K/V versus inhibitor concentration. Multiple K\ni values were determined and the results were averaged to yield the final reported values. The reactions were completed after 10 min. Those that still show starting material were heated to 60 \u00b0C for several hours. The wells were then assayed at 100 nM, in which compounds 2 and 3 showed better inhibition activity. These two compounds were synthesized on a large scale and their K\ni values were determined (see Fig. 1\n).",
