This ethical imperative turned 'moral opportunity' may be highlighted by China's current mobilization around the fight against Covid-19. In its development of a heretofore unprecedented form of 'risk community/cosmopolitan solidarity' (Beck 2013) , China has effectively seized the moral opportunity provided by the current moment of crisis-cum-openness as highlighted by Beck and Grande (2010) . Specifically, China has contributed both material resources such as testing kits, masks, monetary donations, and medical personnel (Moritsugu 2020; Kuo 2020) , as well as cognitive resources such as open-source scientific research relating to testing, prevention, and the development of a Covid-19 vaccine ). However, these efforts have been labeled by some as merely an attempt by China to make up for a 'botched initial response'-the censorship of doctors, which made the spread far worse than it might have been (Fuchs 2020) . While this critique may very well hold water, the USA and China both have been spreading unfounded conspiracy theories as part of a 'weaponization' of Covid-19 for political ends-resulting in a climate of anti-Chinese racism and xenophobia in the US and an increased anti-foreign nationalist sentiment in China (Fuchs 2020; Kuo and Davidson 2020) .",

Thusly, during this time of crisis, what is needed is an unprecedented level of open collaboration-a global concerted effort towards the eradication of Covid-19. At this moment of the fight, China represents an important risk community that possesses not only the material resources and cognitive expertise to stop this pandemic, but most importantly, it is exhibiting a much-needed willingness to engage in a transnational 'praxis' of cosmopolitan solidarity.",

Notwithstanding, in the postdigital age, this problematic notion of crowd wisdom may still yet warrant a hopeful association with the notion of collective intelligence. Specifically, this hopefulness is rooted to an understanding that technology has created new networks of research, sharing, and collaboration, based in the logic that solutions to global problems are better solved through the democratic engagement of people who are well-informed and therefore less-biased in their collective groupthought (Peters and Jandri\u0107 2018b).",

These instances of competition are clearly witnessed within the USA and China's continued jockeying over global leadership positioning. Moreover, as the global death toll continues to rise, the USA and China compete over who has contributed more to the global fight against Covid-19, who is the more responsible leader, and finally, who represents the better 'partner' in the global response to Covid-19 (Finnegan 2020) . Embedded within this digital 'clash of civilizations' discourse, played out over tweets by government officials who claim '#truth' as they retweet unverifiable conspiracy theories to the masses (Mu 2020) , lies the very analog desire to cement the boundaries between us and them. This belies the notion that as technology and globalization continue to transnationalize and deterritorialize our increasingly mobile identities, social, cultural, and political identities continue to represent retrenched forms of group identity that separate us from them (Delanty 2006a; Green 2020a Green , b, forthcoming 2020c .",

However, while China and its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) remain on the forefront of cosmopolitan hospitality (Green 2020a (Green , b, forthcoming 2020c , its utilization of authoritarian technics, i.e., digital authoritarianism, as a means of surveillance, censorship and political repression, has quickly become a model for the non-democratic world (Feldstein 2020) . Within this dialectic of openness as both democratic and authoritarian, collaborative and competitive, opportunity and danger-an important question begins to materialize. As a global society at risk, within a viral modernity which inhabits both the wisdom of collective intelligence and the emotionally charged folly of decentralized/peer to peer group-think, how should we foment the development of Peters' transnational imperative of ethical universalism-ethos of community?",

Communitarians have argued that the notion of a Kantian ethical community represents nothing more than an atomistic, ethicized 'aloof harmony of separate individual wills \u2026abstracted from human society' (Moore 1992) . While this may be the case, Moore (1992) believes that a less pessimistic interpretation of Kant's kingdom of ends highlights a notion of the ethical community as replete with idealized postulates such as unity, harmony, communal intention, interest in other members, internal bonds, reciprocity, and communal identity. Moreover, these ethical postulates represent a moral task or obligation towards actionpositioning the ethical community as a legitimate object of human hope and striving (Moore 1992) . In searching for an ethical universalism founded in both a community of inquiry and ethic of criticism, Peters (2013) outlines a critical social ontology which is able to both diagnose the pathologies of modern society while illuminating and enhancing a common interest based in co(labor)ative/ collective-intentional ends-a mutual freedom from the reification of cognitive capitalism's power/domination-based hierarchical ends (Thompson 2017) .",

Inherent to this notion of radical openness is the understanding that the prerequisite for a healthy world necessitates the formulation of an ethos of community built upon empathy (Peters 2020a, b) . The empathy inherent to radical openness is also present within the notion of cosmopolitan empathy, wherein the practice of 'exclusive differentiation is cast aside in favor a 'logic of inclusive oppositions''-a cosmopolitan vision which extends our capacity to perceive, in a more sensitive way, the lives of others as both different from our own yet equally fated together within the crises of second modernity (Beck 2006; Beck and Grande 2010; Bielsa and Hermans 2016) . Furthermore, central to the notion of empathy is the concept of 'shared feelings' as a challenge to epistemological individualism, reflected by Schmid's central claim that plural self-awareness can clarify a sense of us into an understanding of ours-an experiential fusion of the plural self (Zahavi 2018 ). Schmid's phenomenal fusion of shared experience/consciousness allows for interpersonal difference, though not between subjects, but rather as different parts of a unified whole (Zahavi 2018) .

For Peters (2020b), individualistic acts of selfishness and competitiveness, i.e., trips to the beach, and the hoarding of toilet paper, etc., represent an irrational form of romantic 'lovesickness.' In lieu of the fleeting pleasures inherent to selfish acts of romantic love, individual sacrifice and collective rationality (exhibited by those who practice social distancing and hand washing) represents a practice of moral love based in virtuous filial dedication to those 70+ who are most at risk (Peters 2020a, b) . This form of sacrificial moral love highlights man's ability to rise above himself for the benefit of the collective good, highlighting how love and respect can affect a harmonious symbiosis between the self and other as us. Lastly, the concept of mutual love and respect inherent to radical openness within an ethos of community can be expressed as follows: 'These two concerns-for self and other-are not competing; in fact, they are intertwined harmoniously. Our individual progress benefits the world and others, and our care for the world and others opens our own minds and hearts.' (Kongtrul 2018: 2) .",
