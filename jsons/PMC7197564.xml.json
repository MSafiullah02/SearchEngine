In 2008, the UK government published its first National Risk Register as the initial step in providing advice on how people and employers could better prepare for civil emergencies [1]. The relative likelihood of pandemic influenza was judged to be higher than that of flooding, roughly equal to severe weather but less likely than attacks on transport or in crowded places. However, the relative impact of pandemic influenza was judged to be the greatest of all risks facing the UK. The World Health Organization cautioned that in the first two decades of this century major epidemics were spreading further and faster than ever [2]. The apparent lack of preparedness for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) such as the lack of sufficient personal protective equipment for health and social care workers is a matter for after-action analysis during the recovery phase when the risk to life has subsided. That is also when it is important to look for opportunities to \u2018build back better\u2019; a concept which refers to measures to make communities more resilient to future disasters, for example, by designing buildings to withstand earthquakes. However, it is as important to ensure that infrastructure and societal systems such as healthcare are better able to deal with the next crisis [3]. This is especially the case when the most foreseeable risks include communicable disease outbreaks [4].",

Three years since that report was published there has been little high-quality research to build the evidence base. This is alarming considering that in the UK, more than a half of occupational health nurses are aged over 50 years [6] and about two-thirds of occupational physicians are aged over 50 years, with the number of training positions at half the long-run average [7].",

In 2006, the Mayo Clinic ran a pilot study of telemedicine in an occupational medicine clinic and reported that patients and providers were comfortable with the technology and satisfied with the outcomes [9]. In Canada, where similarly the majority of workers lack access to an occupational health service (OHS), a case study demonstrated the potential for telehealth to deliver high quality OHS when combined with face-to-face field service teams [10]. In Germany, occupational dermatologists opine that while teledermatology has prospects to contribute to earlier prevention and notification of occupational dermatoses it unlikely to address the decrease in dermatological services [11].

The benefits include reduced disruption to patient lives and reduced need for hospital infrastructure. During the 2018 snow storms NHS Scotland was able to deliver almost all of its outpatient appointments using telemedicine clinics [12].

Disruptive innovation produces cheaper, simpler, more convenient services that revolutionize existing ways of working and meeting customer needs [14]. In recent years, primary care practitioners have been turning to increased use of telephone consultations to manage ever-increasing workload, but there has been little use of video consultation. Because of COVID-19, more of the NHS is exploiting remote consultations so as to minimize the risk of infection for staff and patients and to cope with large numbers of NHS staff who have had to self-isolate because of symptoms of COVID-19 in themselves or in close contacts. In early March 2020, NHS England\u2019s medical director for primary care recommended telephone or video triage to avoid patients coming into primary care surgeries [15]. Within weeks a new consultation service was developed and 80% of practices were using it. Consequently, many NHS primary care physicians who were previously sceptical about video consultations have become proponents [15].",

The most imminent need is to help employers plan better either for the next phase of this pandemic or for the next pandemic, for example not just by replenishing stocks of personal protective equipment but by ordering and holding appropriate amounts. We should also work with employers to examine the extent of and necessity for business travel. As well as being a risk factor for communicable disease and costly for businesses such travel is often a habit driven by preference as much as genuine business need. Considering that travel will be curtailed for many months and business will continue regardless this is a good time to encourage wider adoption of virtual meetings. For those working in international OHS it is an opportunity to discuss with leadership the location of new operations in developing countries and how local employees and expatriates and their families can access quality healthcare.

We should also identify what OHS started to do and what worked well for wider adoption. Finally, there are services which need to be continued but might be performed more efficiently. Such opportunities are sometimes only obvious in times of adversity. Improved and more efficient ways of working should not be construed as intellectual property which provides one OHS with a competitive edge over another.
