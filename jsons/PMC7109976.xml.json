We used mathematical and statistical models to build on the relations among the various parameters. Analyzing the daily number of infected cases would allow us to capture the occurrence of SSEs in an epidemic. In an SSE, the number of infected cases would exceed the expected numbers derived from the number of infectious individuals in the community and the infection rate. We estimated the number of infected cases due to the SSEs by subtracting the expected number of infected cases if no SSE occurred from the estimated total number of infected cases. We further explored the relations between the daily number of symptomatic cases and the daily number of infected cases and tried to identify the group(s) of symptomatic individuals who were most likely to be infectious. The implications for control of future SARS epidemics or other epidemics involving SSEs are discussed.",

The incubation period distribution, pj, was the probability of the onset of symptoms on the jth day after exposure if an individual received a sufficient dose of the SARS virus to cause the disease. The daily admission distribution, qj, was the probability of admission on the jth day after becoming symptomatic. The most reliable data on the reported daily probability of incubation, pj, and the daily probability of admission, qj, were probably those from Donnelly et al. (14), which were based on 57 well-defined cases in Hong Kong. It was expected that errors would be introduced when applying these data to other regions or countries, in particular the distribution of waiting time from symptom onset to hospital admission, which might be affected significantly by local conditions. Fortunately, both equation 2 and the daily probability of admission were not used for analyzing the Singapore data, as the daily distribution of individuals with onset of symptoms was available (6). The incubation period was 2\u201315 days, and the onset probability satisfied a \u03b3 distribution, while the time from onset to admission was about 0\u201315 days, and the admission probability satisfied another \u03b3 distribution (figure 1).",

As the mean infectious period (from symptom onset to admission) determined by the \u03b3 distribution was 3.18 days, the average infection rate per day for an infectious individual was 0.94 (3/3.18). This infection rate value was not applicable after the public health control measures were instituted. An average daily infection rate for the entire duration of the epidemics in Hong Kong and Singapore could also be calculated by the reported total number of infected cases (1), excluding those due to reported SSEs (table 1), divided by the total number of cases daily that were symptomatic but not yet admitted to a hospital over the entire period of the epidemic (obtained by summing the daily number of symptomatic cases that were not yet admitted to a hospital (equation 6) over the entire duration of the epidemics). With this method, the average infection rate per day of general spreaders for the entire epidemic was found to be 0.23 and 0.14 for Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively.

Plotting the daily number of newly infected cases allowed us to identify peaks or aggregates of infections that would suggest SSEs. The good agreement between our predicted infection peaks and the reported occurrence of all seven SSEs in Hong Kong and Singapore suggested some underlying but not yet fully understood mechanisms of disease transmission. The possibility of predicting the likely exposure time also helps in environmental studies to identify the environmental conditions at the time of infection. We predicted several additional SSEs that had not been identified and reported.

Interestingly, the average infection rate per day of general spreaders for the entire epidemic period in Hong Kong was also significantly greater than that in Singapore (0.23 compared with 0.14). According to our estimations, SSEs played a very important role in the SARS epidemic, being responsible for nearly three fourths of the infections in Hong Kong and Singapore. This has important public health implications. If our model is valid, the control of SARS epidemics would be directly governed by the ability to prevent/control the SSEs.

This supports the findings of a hospital study in Vietnam that most SARS patients do not transmit the virus (23). In Singapore, 81 percent of the first 205 reported probable SARS patients had no evidence of transmission to other persons (6). It is not known whether there were differences of many orders of magnitude in the viral shedding rate in time or between infected individuals. There was also no evidence to show whether a super spreader could remain infectious during the entire symptomatic period prior to admission. However, our results seemed to suggest that each super spreader had a relatively short period of strong infectivity, with the peaks in predicted numbers of new infections indicating SSEs being quite narrow.",

Our results strongly suggest that the daily number of new infections did not depend on the total number of symptomatic cases, as only a very small proportion of the symptomatic individuals were infectious. We do not know exactly what makes a super spreader different from other infected individuals, but our results suggested that late admission to a hospital (more than 4 days) after symptom onset could be partly responsible for the occurrence of SSEs, especially during the early phase of the epidemic, since patients admitted late would have developed a high viral load. This agrees with the results of a study of SSEs in Beijing, where the efficiency of SARS transmission increases at a later stage of the illness (24). Peiris et al. (25) found that the viral load increased after the onset of symptoms and peaked at around day 10. The World Health Organization\u2019s consensus document on the SARS epidemiology (23) noted that, in the data from Singapore, few secondary cases occurred when symptomatic cases were isolated within 5 days of illness onset. The importance of early detection/diagnosis and early admission/isolation cannot be overemphasized.",

The super spreading phenomena of Ebola were suspected to be due to a larger number of \u201ccontacts\u201d of the super spreaders or some inherent differences in the virus-host relations, such as, perhaps, a more virulent virus strain or higher levels of viral shedding (11). The great variability in the numbers of infected cases among the seven identified super spreaders in SARS epidemics in Singapore and Hong Kong suggested that some epidemiologic and environmental factors could have contributed to the infection. For the outbreak at Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, it has been suggested that the environmental control systems (drainage system and aerosol flows) were responsible for amplifying the virus sources and for transmitting the virus to a large number of people (3). In the case of the Prince of Wales Hospital, the use of a nebulized bronchodilator was believed to be an important factor that increased the droplet loading surrounding the index patient (5). However, new studies suggest the possible roles of airborne virus-laden aerosols and the ventilation system design (26). These two examples suggest the possible roles of the environment in amplifying viral sources in SSEs and further support our hypothesis that an SSE is also determined by environmental factors. Hence, proper environmental and ventilation design would be very important in controlling future SSE-based SARS coronavirus transmissions.",

Environmental factors such as proximity of contacts, temperature, humidity, aerosolization processes, airflows, and ventilation can be important.

The World Health Organization consensus document (23) also summarized that the mean incubation periods were 4\u20137.2 days. We performed a sensitivity study by considering three different incubation probability distributions with a mean of 5.3, 6.37, and 7.3 days, with both a small and a large variance (8 and 16.69 days2). The predicted general intermittent behavior of the infection patterns is very similar, but the infection peaks can be advanced or delayed by about 1 day.",

It is still unclear whether a subclinical form of the disease exists in the community. Our chosen mathematical model was also a simple one and did not include the spatial relations of disease transmission (8). The assumption of the infectious period from symptom onset to hospital admission did not consider the fact that some patients were still infectious after hospitalization but were not under effective isolation during the early days of the epidemic. After the strict isolation measures were implemented in Hong Kong and Singapore, the reported date of admission would be equivalent to the date of isolation, although some limited hospital-acquired infection might still occur. In Hong Kong, the community infection constituted a much higher proportion of the total number of cases than in Singapore. The impact of the infectivity period assumption on the analyses for Hong Kong might be smaller than the impact on those for Singapore.",

In practice, such a simple model needs to be combined with studies on transmission dynamics, which provide essential data on the infection rate of the general spreaders. The accuracy of the prediction of SSE occurrence depends on the accuracy of the input data, that is, the distribution of the daily number of individuals admitted to hospitals (or becoming symptomatic), the daily probability of symptom onset after being infected, and the daily probability of being admitted to hospitals after developing symptoms. This means that various hypotheses derived from our analyses remain to be confirmed by further epidemiologic and clinical studies.",
