Direct Gram stain revealed that the isolates were Gram-positive, not Gram-variable, coccoidal to rod forms. They were 0.4-0.7 mm in diameter, and occurred in singles, pairs, or irregular clumps. To isolate and identify this microorganism, subcultures of the positive blood culture bottle were performed and yielded growth on a blood agar plate under aerobic conditions. Colonies were creamy, yellowish, circular, and convex, measuring 1 mm in size. The isolate was non-motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, coagulase-negative, and indole-negative ( Fig. 1) . The Vitek 2 system (bioM erieux Inc.) was used for bacterial identification, and the result was Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum (95% probability) with low discrimination confidence. Additionally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a VITEK MS system (bioM erieux Inc.) was employed, but the result was indeterminate. The isolate was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and a sequence containing 1432 nucleotides was compared for similarity with the GenBank database. There was 99.86% homology of Janibacter hoylei (GenBank accession number NR_104794), followed by 98.81% of Janibacter anopheles (GenBank accession number NR_043218), 98.6% of Janibacter limosus (Gen-Bank accession number NR_026362), and 98.47% of Janibacter cremeus (GenBank accession number NR_114380). For antimicrobial susceptibility tests, we followed the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standardized disk diffusion method (3) . The isolate with 0.5 McFarland standard was inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% blood and incubated at 35\u00b0C. Zone diameters were read after 48 hours. Due to the lack of a zone diameter breakpoint for Janibacter spp., we used the zone diameter breakpoint for Corynebacterium spp. according to EUCAST clinical breakpoint tables. Disks of benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline were used, and isolates were shown to be \"susceptible\" to all agents except benzylpenicillin. Zone diameters were as follows: benzylpenicillin, 12 mm; ciprofloxacin, 34 mm; gentamicin, 46 mm; vancomycin, 47 mm; clindamycin, 29 mm; and tetracycline, 50 mm.",

Gram stains for these strains are Gram-variable or Gram-positive with coccoidal to rod forms in singles, pairs, or irregular clumps (4) . Although the natural habitat is not fully understood, members of the genus Janibacter have been recovered from various environments including environmentally polluted samples, melon, the midgut of mosquitoes, coral, sea sediment, and an air sample (1, 2, 5-9). Among Janibacter spp., J. hoylei was first isolated from cryotubes used to collect air samples in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of 40-41.4 km and was named after Sir Fred Hoylei, the renowned English astronomer, in 2009 (2). The draft genome sequence of this strain was announced (10), but J. hoylei has been previously isolated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of J. hoylei bacteremia and shows that J. hoylei can be isolated from not only high altitude environmental samples but also ground samples. To date, three literature publications and a total of six cases of bacteremia caused by the genus Janibacter have been reported. In 2005, two cases were simultaneously reported. The pathogen was identified in one case as J. melonis, and the other isolate was not identified (11, 12) . Bacteremia caused by J. terrae has also been reported, with a total of four cases described in 2015 (13) . With the exception of one case caused by J. melonis in a healthy horse-riding instructor, all five cases had underlying conditions, and three were diagnosed with hematologic malignancy. Therefore, Janibacter spp. may be considered an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. However, the previously healthy patient case and our patient suggest that these strains can have pathogenic potential for bacteremia in relatively healthy patients without any other risk factors.",

In a recent report, Fern andez-Natal et al. applied the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute method for antimicrobial susceptibility of coryneform organisms to J. terrae isolates and showed susceptibility to imipenem, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole (13) . In our case, J. hoylei showed susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline.
