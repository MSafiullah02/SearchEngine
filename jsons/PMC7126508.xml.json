Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired with a Bruker Ascend 600 NMR spectrometer in CDCl3 and pyridine-d\n5 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. Chemical shifts were given in \u03b4 (ppm), and coupling constants (J) were expressed in hertz (Hz). Preparative HPLC was carried out on a Waters liquid chromatography system equipped with 1525 Binary HPLC Pump and 2489 UV/ Visible detector using a Waters Xbridge Prep C8 column (10 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Semi-preparative HPLC was conducted on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system coupled with a quaternary pump and a diode array detector (DAD) using a Waters Xbridge Prep C18 column (10 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Silica gel (40\u201360 \u03bcm, Grace, USA) and Bondapak Waters ODS (40\u201363 \u03bcm, Waters, USA) were used for column chromatographies. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) used to monitor fractions was performed on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates and TLC silica gel 60 RP-18 F254S plates (200 \u03bcm thick, Merck KGaA, Germany).

Then, compounds 3 (3.0 mg) and 9 (5.0 mg) were isolated by an ODS columns with a gradient elution of CH3OH \u2212 H2O (40:60\u2013100:0, v/v) from the subfractions Fr.11\u201315-7 (38.9 mg) and Fr.11\u201315-8 (40.0 mg), respectively.",

Its HRESIMS showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 467.2812 [M \u2212 H]\u2212 (calcd for C29H39O5, 467.2803), corresponding to the molecular formula of C29H40O5 with ten degrees of unsaturation. Its UV spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 236 and 360 nm, suggesting the presence of a conjugated system in 1. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed characteristic signals for three olefinic protons [\u03b4H 6.32 (1H, dd, J\n = 6.6, 1.2 Hz, H-6), 5.98 (1H, d, J\n = 6.6 Hz, H-7), 5.81 (1H, d, J\n = 1.2 Hz, H-1)], a methoxyl group [\u03b4H 3.30 (3H, s)], and six tertiary methyl groups [\u03b4H 1.73 (3H, s, H3\u201323), 1.46 (3H, s, H3\u201325), 1.21 (3H, s, H3\u201326), 1.20 (3H, s, H3\u201330), 1.07 (3H, s, H3\u201328), 0.70 (3H, s, H3\u201327)]. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) displayed 29 carbon signals, including signals of a carboxylic carbon (\u03b4c 182.7, C-29), a conjugated ester carbonyl carbon (\u03b4c 163.8, C-2), three double bonds, six quaternary carbons (including a ketal one), one methine, seven methylenes, and seven methyl groups (including an oxygenated one), which were accounted for five degrees of unsaturation. These characteristic data suggested 1 to be a dinor-friedelene derivative with five rings [22], [23], [24]. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 1 with those of dzununcanone [22], [24], a 3,24-dinor-2,4-seco-friedelene triterpene, indicated both compounds bearing similar B-, C-, D- and E-rings. The downfield shift of C-29 (\u03b4c 182.7) in 1 relative to that (\u03b4c 179.1) in dzununcanone [22], [24] implied a carboxylic acid group present at C-29 in 1 instead of the methyl ester in dzununcanone. The remaining signals of 1 showed a olefinic carbon (\u03b4c 110.3, C-1), a conjugated carbonyl carbon (\u03b4c 163.8, C-2), a ketal carbon (\u03b4c 103.8, C-4), a tertiary methyl (\u03b4c 24.8, C-23) and a methoxyl (\u03b4c 50.5) groups. The upfield shift of the C-2 carbonyl (\u03b4c 163.8) in 1 relative to that (\u03b4c 166.1) in dzununcanone revealed that an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b4-lactone ring was formed between C-2 and C-4 in 1, accounting for the remaining one degree of unsaturation. Both the methoxyl and the tertiary methyl groups were assigned at C-4, as deduced from HMBC correlations from their protons to C-4 (\u03b4\nC 103.8) in 1. Thus, the planar structure of 1 was established as a 2, 4-esterified derivative of dzununcanone, which was further confirmed by 1H \u2212 \n1H COSY and HMBC correlations (Fig. 2A).",

The 1H NMR data (Table 1) displayed the presence of an olefinic proton [\u03b4\nH 5.62 (1H, dd, J\n = 8.0, 3.0 Hz, H-15)], two oxygenated methine protons [\u03b4\nH 4.13 (1H, td, J\n = 9.6, 4.2 Hz, H-2) and 3.39 (1H, d, J\n = 9.6 Hz, H-3)], and seven tertiary methyl groups [\u03b4\nH 1.53 (3H, s, H3\u201330), 1.28 (3H, s, H3\u201323), 1.13 (6H, s, H3\u201324 and H3\u201326), 1.05 (3H, s, H3\u201325), 1.02 (3H, s, H3\u201327) and 0.96 (3H, s, H3\u201328)]. The 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 3 showed 30 carbon signals, which were ascribed to a carboxylic group (\u03b4\nC 182.2, C-29), two olefinic carbons [\u03b4\nC 158.4 (C-14) and 117.1 (C-15)], five methines (including two oxygenated ones), six quaternary carbons, nine methylenes, and seven methyl carbons by DEPT and HMBC experiments. These characteristic signals indicated that 3 was a taraxerene-type triterpene [25], [26], [27]. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 3 were very similar to those of esculentoic acid A [26] isolated from Manihot esculenta, except for the presence of an additional oxygenated methine [\u03b4\nH 4.13 (1H, td, J\n = 9.6, 4.2 Hz, H-2); \u03b4\nC 68.6] and the absence of a methylene signals (\u03b4\nH 1.78 and 1.60; \u03b4\nC 25.3) in esculentoic acid A [26]. The downfield shift of H-2 at \u03b4\nH 4.13 suggested hydroxylation of C-2 in 3 compared to those (\u03b4\nH 1.78 and 1.60) in esculentoic acid A [26]. The coupling constant of 9.6 Hz between H-2 and H-3 (J\n2, 3) indicated a 2,3-trans diaxial relationship of the above two protons in 3, whereas the H-3 was in a equatorial bond in esculentoic acid due to a smaller J\n2, 3 of 2.8 Hz. The key NOESY correlations of H-2/H3\u201325\u03b2, and H-3/H-5\u03b1 suggested an \u03b1-oriented hydroxyl group at C-2 and a \u03b2-oriented hydroxyl group at C-3 in 3.
