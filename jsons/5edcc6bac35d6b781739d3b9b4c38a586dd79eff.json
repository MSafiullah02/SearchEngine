Likewise, the shorter is the period at risk (and therefore the predicted duration of prophylaxis), the higher is the possibility that prophylaxis will work. However, the prediction of an incidence of infection is not simple, and requires an analysis of various factors including patient's prior exposure to pathogens, underlying disease, previous and current treatment, comorbidities, geographic area, and others. Therefore, three questions are critical in defining the appropriateness of antimicrobial prophylaxis: what is the risk for infection; what are the pathogens that predominate in this setting; and what is the period at risk. In this chapter, we describe various strategies directed at the prevention of infections in patients with hematological malignancies, according to this risk-based strategy. Table 49 .1 provides a risk-targeted approach to prophylaxis of infections in patients with hematological malignancies and Table 49 .2 presents the most frequent pathogens responsible for infection according to type of immunodeficiency present. Risk assessment in each underlying disease (e.g., age, initial white blood cell count, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, rapidity of cytoreduction in acute lymphoid leukemia; advanced age, de novo vs. secondary leukemia, prior myelodysplasia, cytogenetics, gene mutation profile in acute myeloid leukemia; mutational status of immunoglobulin Vh gene and chromosomal abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia) b Most common disease-related immunosuppression include: hypogammaglobulinemia (multiple myeloma, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia), T-cell mediated immunodeficiency (Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and neutrophil dysfunction (acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia) c Infections with higher risk of recurrence include: mycobacteriosis (tuberculosis and others), aspergillosis, pneumocystosis, cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex and Varicella-zoster virus, toxoplasmosis and strongyloidiasis d Renal failure increases the risk of severe mucositis in patients with multiple myeloma receiving melphalan-based conditioning regimens e Need for additional chemotherapy in lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia is usually related to relapse of the underlying disease, whereas in multiple myeloma additional chemotherapy is usually part of the treatment strategy f in vitro manipulation of stem cells decreases the content of CD34+ and T-cells, increasing the duration of neutropenia in the early posttransplant period and delaying T-cell immune reconstitution after transplant ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1582, "end": 1583, "text": "b", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 927, "end": 935, "text": "Table 49", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1058, "text": "Table 49", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Patients and health care workers should be educated about the risk of and methods to prevent acquisition of pathogens.
