Hence, for him/her the content learned is the focus of the student\u2019s activity.Heutagogy can be regarded as an art, and the teacher, being a romantic individual, is an authentic creator who loves his students and enhances their capability to self-fulfill themselves. Hence, for him/her the student\u2019s self-determined process is the focus of the teachers\u2019 activity.\n",

Even for the teacher \u201cwhose obligation is to ascertain that the new generation will share his faith\u201d (Back, 2012, p. 20) it is possible to practice some of heutagogy\u2019s ingredients as we saw in the first example of Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-4144-5_7 (The Talmud and the Havruta).",

However, we did not investigate the issue of ICT in the teaching\u2013learning processes beyond mentioning the students\u2019 use of the internet and the power-point application for wandering and presenting of knowledge. The reason is that we do not propose a technologically oriented modification of the academic tradition. Yet, heutagogy can contribute to long distance learning (e-heutagogy) as can be exemplified by the works of Blaschke (2013), Kerry (2013), Gerstein (2014), and Belt (2014). As noted in the book\u2019s Preface, e-heutagogy is a feasible way to deal with worldwide crises like the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It enables the students to continue to learn in a way that promote their self-determined learning.\n",

He suggests calling the role of the art defamiliarization and offers the metaphor of \u201cto make a stone stony\u201d, which means to realize the essence of things. Defamiliarization encourages people to create an open and ongoing dialogue with what they are already familiar with, such as nature, people, texts, phenomena, and theories, in order to expand their meaning.",

Defamiliarization invites learning through a journey, which also demonstrates the ideas of learning by wandering and learning for its own sake.",

To ensure that students will learn, we impose more requirements and quality assurance procedures. We forget that \u201ctrust breeds trust\u201d (2002). Heutagogy advances the idea that we trust the students and their desire to learn. We trust that they know what they want, and that they want to improve the quality of their life. Some of them need to learn how to do it. And we believe that to this end, heutagogy might be a promising starting point.",
