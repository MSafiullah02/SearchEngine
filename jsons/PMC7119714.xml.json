The diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is anatomically divided into the intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) and the lamina propria compartment (LPC). Leukocytes derived from each compartment have been differentiated by anatomical location as well as phenotype and function, thus defining a compartmentalization unique to the mucosal immune system (Lundqvist et al., 1995).",

Morphologically, a large percentage of IELs have intracytoplasmic azurophilic granules containing granzymes and perforin (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991, Mowat and Viney, 1997). Phenotypically, the majority of IELs are T cells with CD3/CD8 phenotype (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991, Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993, Mowat and Viney, 1997). A majority of IELs also co-express CD103, the \u03b1E\u03b27 integrin required for homing and retention of lymphocytes in the mucosal epithelium (Cepek et al., 1994). However, considerable phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in IELs where CD4+/CD8+ (DP), CD4\u2212/CD8\u2212 (DN) T cells and unusual subpopulations such as CD3\u2212/CD8+ and CD4+/CD8\u03b1\u03b1+ lymphocytes are described (Lefrancois, 1991, Maloy et al., 1991, Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993, Mowat and Viney, 1997). Reasons for heterogeneity in this mucosal lymphoid pool are not well understood. However, this phenotypic diversity displayed by mucosal IELs is likely a reflection of the range of functions performed by IELs as the first line of defence against mucosal antigens, and is attributed to influences from both the intestinal local environment and the intestinal epithelium.",

The intestinal mucosal barrier and presumably, the MALT, also have a role in the pathogenesis of feline corona virus infection and the resultant development of feline infectious peritonitis (Pedersen et al., 1981). However, characterization of feline normal intestinal MALT has not been reported. In this study, flow cytometry, immunohistology and cytology were used to characterize the diffuse MALT of the small intestine in normal cats. Additionally, we describe the distribution and expression of the novel leukointegrin CD11d (Danilenko et al., 1995) in the feline MALT. The most striking findings in this study were the elevated percentages of CD8\u03b1+ T cells, presumed to express CD8\u03b1\u03b1 chains, and CD4\u2212/CD8\u2212 (double negative) lymphocytes in the IEC, and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3+/CD11d+ IELs. This contrasts with salient phenotypic characteristics of the feline LPL population which included increased percentages of CD4+ T cells, reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells, presumed to express both CD8\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, and minimal expression of CD11d.",

The small intestine, extending from the duodenum to the ileo-cecocolic junction was excised. Fecal material and excess mucus were removed from the intestinal lumen with extensive flushing with RPMI 1640 medium pH 7.4 containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 \u03bcl/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (all from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The intestine was opened longitudinally and cut into 2 cm fragments and the Peyer\u2019s patches were resected. The intestinal fragments were washed for 10 min with the solution described above prior to leukocyte extraction. Extraction of cells from the IEC consisted of incubation of washed intestinal fragments with stirring for an hour in Ca2+Mg2+ free Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Fisher Scientific), containing 5 mM EDTA, 10% FetalClone I serum (Hyclone Inc., Oregon, UT) and 10 mM HEPES. Cell suspensions were collected after centrifugation of the supernatant at 200\u00d7g for 5 min. This procedure was repeated twice for maximum leukocyte IEC yield. The intestinal segments were further washed with stirring for 1 h prior to extraction of leukocytes from the LPC. LPC leukocytes from nine animals were obtained after 6\u20138 h incubation of the IEL-extracted intestinal fragments on an orbital shaker (Bellco Glass Inc, Vineland, NJ) at 10\u00d7g in RPMI 1640 pH 7.4 containing 0.01% collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ), 10% FetalClone I serum, 10 mM HEPES. Collagenase type III was used for extraction of LPLs because of its low proteolytic activity and reduced likelihood of enzymatic degradation of cell surface antigens. The collagenase recognition sequence (PXGP) is rare in proteins other than collagen and is not present in the feline lymphocyte molecules for which sequences are known (CD4, CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2). The collagenase digested material was pressed through a stainless steel wire mesh (Fisher Scientific) to free the LPC leukocytes. The IEC and LPC leukocyte suspensions were filtered four times through columns packed with glass wool (Fisher Scientific). Following extraction and filtration, IEC and LPC leukocytes were washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) with 10% v/v heat inactivated horse serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and 0.01% sodium azide (buffer A) for cytospin preparations and flow cytometry.",

Quantitation of expression, distribution within the intra-epithelial compartment and cytologic features of IELs were investigated using flow cytometry, immunohistology and cytology. The majority of IELs, including both granular and non-granular lymphocytes, expressed CD3. Fewer IELs expressed CD5.

Although increased numbers of CD8+lymphocytes were present in the IEL pool, a discrepancy in expression of CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 was observed. As many as 40% of CD8\u03b1+ IELs did not express the CD8\u03b2 chain and were interpreted as CD8\u03b1\u03b1 IELs.

As in the IEL population, the majority of LPLs were CD3+ T cells with fewer cells expressing CD5. However, CD4 and CD8\u03b1 expression differed from the IEL population.

This variation in percentages of CD4 and CD8\u03b1 lymphocytes resulted in a LPL CD4:CD8\u03b1 ratio of 1.0, which was increased over that observed in the IEL pool. In contrast to the increased expression of CD8\u03b1 over CD8\u03b2 antigens as observed in the IEL pool, CD8+ cells in the LPL pool were composed of similar percentages of CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 cells. This equivalent level of CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 expression was more consistent with the majority of CD8 lymphocytes in the LPL compartment expressing CD8\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers, and fewer CD8 lymphocytes expressing CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimers.",

This variable expression was also observed by immunohistology where variation in intensity of staining occurred. A majority of LPLs also expressed CD18. In addition, immunohistology demonstrated CD18 expression on macrophages, neutrophils and antigen presenting cells. With the exception of rare neutrophils and macrophages in the LPC, CD11b was not expressed by IELs or LPLs. CD11d, the fourth \u03b1 chain of the \u03b22 integrin family, was expressed by a small subpopulation of IELs (Table 3). Dual label staining demonstrated that CD11d cells largely co-expressed CD3. However, although 40% of CD11d+ cells co-expressed CD8\u03b1 and 15% of CD11d+ cells co-expressed CD4, as many as 45% of CD11d+ cells proved to be negative for both CD4 and CD8 antigens (Table 3).

In this study, adaptation of existing methods originally developed for the study of diffuse MALT in humans and rodents, resulted in consistent cell yield and purity from feline intestine. Feline IELs were enriched for granular lymphocytes, this was especially so in juvenile cats. The majority of feline IEL were T cells, which consistently expressed CD3, but exhibited reduced frequency of expression of CD5. Feline IEL predominantly expressed CD8\u03b1 and less frequently CD8\u03b2, but a large population of lymphocytes, which lacked expression of CD4 or CD8, was also prevalent. In contrast, feline IEL, which co-expressed CD4 and CD8 were rare. In these respects feline IEL differed markedly from IEL of rodents (Vaage et al., 1990, Fangmann et al., 1991, Lefrancois, 1991, Maloy et al., 1991, Takimoto et al., 1992, Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993, Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995, Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996, Helgeland et al., 1997) and humans (Spencer et al., 1989, Jarry et al., 1990, Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993, Machado et al., 1994, Lundqvist et al., 1995). Unexpectedly, feline IEL exhibited broad variation in MHC class II expression between individuals, in contrast to the consistent high frequency of MHC class II expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes of all lineages in cats. Also, the expression of CD11d by a minor subset of feline IEL appeared to be a unique feature. Feline LPLs were more difficult to assess due to poor viability following prolonged incubation necessary for their release. Feline LPL populations were broadly similar to IEL populations with the exception of higher frequency of CD4 expression by T cells and lower frequency of CD8\u03b1 expression. In contrast to IEL, granular lymphocytes were infrequently encountered, and CD11d expression was minimal in the LPL population.",

Immunostaining of tissue sections and cytocentrifuge preparations qualitatively validated the lymphocyte phenotypes on IELs and LPLs that were established by quantitative flow cytometry. Although consistent leukocyte yields were obtained in both juvenile and adult cats, juvenile cats had significantly reduced IEC yields compared with adults. However, despite this reduced cell yield in juvenile cats, differential cell counts demonstrated that granular lymphocytes represented a significantly increased percentage of cells in the IEC. Although this has been observed in other species, the reasons or mechanisms by which this age-associated variation in yield and lymphocyte morphology occurs are not well understood. Aging has been associated with elevation in IEL numbers in man (Machado et al., 1994) and mouse (Maloy et al., 1991) and is hypothesized to be driven by continuous antigen stimulation. This increased cell yield which was consistently detected in adult cats suggests that a similar situation occurs in this species. The variation in lymphocyte morphology is also reported in other species. Granular IELs are reported in the rat where they represent a significant percentage of the CD3+ IEL population (Vaage et al., 1990). However, despite this observation, the function and significance of granular lymphocytes remains unknown.",

This variation in CD4 and CD8 expression was assessed by examination of the CD4:CD8 ratio in each compartment. Increased percentages of CD8\u03b1+ lymphocytes (40%) and low percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes (10%) resulted in an IEL CD4:CD8\u03b1 ratio of 0.25.

This discrepancy implied that a significant percentage of CD8 IELs expressed CD8\u03b1\u03b2 homodimers, rather than CD8\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers. This contrasts with the predominance of CD8\u03b1\u03b2 lymphocytes observed in other peripheral lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood and thymus. This discrepancy between CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 chain expression was not observed in the feline LPL population where both CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 chains were expressed in similar percentages, more consistent with conventional CD8\u03b1\u03b2 chain expression. The predominance of expression of CD8\u03b1\u03b1 chains by feline CD8+IELs is similar to that described in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991), rat (Kuhnlein et al., 1994, Helgeland et al., 1997) and man (Jarry et al., 1990, Latthe et al., 1994) where they represent a substantial subpopulation of CD8+ IELs.

The localization of CD8\u03b1\u03b1 lymphocytes in intraepithelial sites has also suggested that both the intestinal environment and epithelium play a critical role in expression of this phenotype (Reimann and Rudolphi, 1995). As a means of defining possible functions of CD8\u03b1\u03b1 IELs in immune surveillance, further investigations have focused on T cell receptor (TCR) expression and TCR-V\u03b2 repertoire of this subpopulation. However, significant differences between CD8\u03b1\u03b1 and CD8\u03b1\u03b2 IELs have not been described.

            "text": "A major fraction of feline IELs lacked expression of CD4 and CD8. This double negative (DN) subpopulation accounted for greater than 40% of the IEL pool. While this phenotype is unusual compared with lymphocytes described in peripheral blood and tissues, DN lymphocytes are consistently reported as a subpopulation of IELs. However, in contrast to our findings in the cat, DN lymphocytes represent minor IEL subpopulations accounting for less than 10% of IELs in both rat (Taguchi et al., 1991) and man (Spencer et al., 1989). This percentage of DN cells in this feline study may be exaggerated by the inclusion of natural killer (NK) cells or TCR\u03b3\u03b4 T cells which would not be expected to express either CD4 or CD8 antigens. More precise phenotypic analysis to determine TCR expression or the presence of NK cells within this DN population was not performed due to the lack of feline specific reagents. Also, CD3 expression on this DN subpopulation which would be expected on TCR\u03b3\u03b4 IELs was not directly determined. While murine studies demonstrate CD3 expression on intestinal TCR\u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes (Camerini et al., 1993, Kuhnlein et al., 1994), they are mostly negative for CD4 and CD8. By analogy, feline intestinal TCR\u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are also be expected to be negative for CD4 and CD8. Converse to the findings with DN IELs, only a minor fraction of feline IELs co-expressed CD4 and CD8. This dual positive (DP) fraction accounted for only 2% of IELs which is, therefore, similar to the percentage of DP lymphocytes observed in peripheral blood. Again, this contrasts with reports in other species where DP lymphocytes represent much larger subpopulations of the IEL pool. This may range from 20 to 35% of IELs in rat (Fangmann et al., 1991, Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996) and 4\u201330% of IELs in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991, Taguchi et al., 1991, Boll et al., 1995).",

Investigation of expression of the alpha subunits was restricted to CD11b and CD11d as feline specific reagents that recognize CD11a and CD11c are not available. A minor subpopulation of feline IELs expressed CD11d. The CD11d molecule is the most recently described alpha chain of the leukointegrin family, and its distribution has been examined most extensively in the dog (Danilenko et al., 1995). Canine CD11d is expressed by a minor subset of both splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes, and there is no evidence of CD11d expression by intestinal lymphocytes by immunohistology. However, in humans, CD11d expression appears more diffuse and has been observed on mononuclear cells of the mucosa as well as deeper layers of the intestine (Bernstein et al., 1996). As CD11d expression in the cat is largely similar in its tissue distribution to that described for dogs (Danilenko et al., 1995), the finding of CD11d+ feline IELs was unexpected. Despite the presence of CD11d+ lymphocytes in this unexpected location in the cat, many phenotypic similarities were noted between the feline IEL and canine splenic and peripheral blood CD11d+ lymphocytes. This includes the expression of CD3 by the majority of cells, the presence of a large percentage of DN cells, and the predominance of CD8 expression over CD4 as a component of this subpopulation. Also of note, were the presence of intracytoplasmic granules in 35% of canine splenic CD11d+ lymphocytes. As a significant population of feline IELs also exhibited granular morphology, it is likely that a subpopulation of granular IELs also express CD11d.",

As in these species, feline IELs were mostly CD3 T cells with reduced expression of CD5 and a predominance of CD8\u03b1 expression over CD4. However, while T cell antigen expression was principally analogous to other species, quantitative differences were noted in the cat. This included increased numbers of DN lymphocytes, reduced numbers of DP lymphocytes and the presence of a minor subpopulation of CD11d+ IELs. As described for other species, the feline LPL population differed phenotypically from IELs. These differences included the reduced expression of CD8\u03b1 and increased expression of CD4 and CD8\u03b2. However, further phenotypic investigation is clearly needed to better characterize mucosal T cell populations. In particular, investigation of TCR expression by both IEL and LPL subpopulations, expression of \u03b1E\u03b27 and \u03b14\u03b27 integrins associated with mucosal lymphocyte trafficking, and expression of markers of T cell activation are necessary to better understand the phenotypic basis of normal intestinal mucosal immune function in the cat.
