The system includes a laser-induced fluorescence microfluidic chip analyzer, a glass microchip for both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis, a chip thermal cycler based on dual Peltier thermoelectric elements, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS diagnostic kit, and a DNA electrophoretic sizing kit. The system allows efficient cDNA amplification of SARS-CoV followed by electrophoretic sizing and detection on the same chip. To enhance the reliability of RT-PCR on SARS-CoV detection, duplex PCR was developed on the microchip. The assay was carried out on a home-made microfluidic chip system. The positive and the negative control were cDNA fragments of SARS-CoV and parainfluenza virus, respectively. The test results showed that 17 positive samples were obtained among 18 samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from clinically diagnosed SARS patients. However, 12 positive results from the same 18 samples were obtained by the conventional RT-PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis detection. The SARS virus species can be analyzed with high positive rate and rapidity on the microfluidic chip system.",

It is the first major new infectious disease of this century, unusual in its high morbidity and mortality rates. Until now, more than 8000 persons with probable SARS have been diagnosed, 916 patients died. Fortunately, the outbreaks in the initial waves of infection have been brought under control. In the absence of effective drugs or a vaccine for SARS, control of this disease relies on the rapid identification of cases and their appropriate management, including the isolation of suspect and probable cases and the management of their close contacts. Therefore, the establishment of a rapid noninvasive test for this virus is a high priority for detection and control of this disease.",

            "text": "Due to the efforts of the WHO-led international multicenter collaborative network of laboratory testing for SARS, tests for the novel coronavirus have been developed with unprecedented speed [2] . The methods include a molecular test reverse transcription ((RT)-PCR) [3] , virus isolation, antibody detection including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a neutralization test. But, as SARS epidemic spreads, the specific, rapid, and practical diagnostic tests will become increasingly critical, both for the control of the epidemic and for the management of patients. Among tests, antibody tests detect antibodies produced in response to the SARS coronavirus infection. The determination of different types of antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) after SARS-coronavirus (CoV) infection offers a good diagnostic method. However, antibodies apparently increase about 10 days after infection, so the pathogen is undetectable at the early stage of infection. The other effective method is virus isolation in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood or stool) from SARS patients, which can be detected by inoculating cell cul-tures and growing the virus. After isolation, the virus still needs to be identified as SARS virus with further tests. Positive cell culture results indicate the presence of live SARS-CoV in the sample tested and negative cell culture results do not exclude SARS. Cell culture methods are time-consuming and nonspecific. It is unlikely accepted as a universal SARS detection method. The molecular test (RT-PCR) is one of the most commonly used methods for RNA virus detection; it has high sensitivity and can make diagnosis at the early stage [4] . Poon et al. [5] reported a real-time quantitative PCR assay, which performed quite well (sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 98%) and it appeared to become positive before antibodies first appeared. It was a good early diagnostic assay for SARS but it was expensive for people in the developing countries. The conventional RT-PCR assay is cheap but the positive rate is lower than the quantitative PCR assays [6] . Therefore, an ideal test for virus will not be only rapid, sensitive, and specific, but also inexpensive and technologically simple, so that it is available at the point of care even in small hospitals or in communities in the developing countries. To achieve the goal, therefore, it is worth studying whether or not the microfluidic chip (lab-on-a-chip) technology can play a role in the early identification of contagion, especially infection of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "The miniaturization of chemical and mechanical devices for microelectromechanical systems has gained great attention in industry and academic institutions worldwide over recent years. Examples include lab-on-a-chip or microfluidic devices such as on-chip flow-through PCR, microreaction technology, electrophoretic separation devices, etc. [7] . These approaches offer novel ways to achieve fast separation with high resolution in a miniaturized fabrication including sample pretreatment steps i.e., sample concentration, labeling, and digestion with the additional possibility of multiplexing. At the same time, there are a lot of alternative methods of DNA analysis on microchips. For example, the TaqMan real-time PCR in silicon-based reactors amplified a variety of DNA and RNA targets [8] [9] [10] in order to detect pathogenic viruses and bacteria, plant genes, human genetic diseases, and single nucleotide polymorphism [11, 12] . Although these alternative methods do not provide the DNA sizing information required for a number of biological, biomedical, and forensic analyses, they are useful for various high-throughput applications. The high sensitivity of DNA analysis (detection limit in the order of 10 221 mol) [13] had been achieved among those various approaches. Particularly, on-chip PCR provided both rapid, efficient amplification of DNA and low cost [14] , and even followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products in situ [15] . So, we assume that microfluidic chip technology may play an important role in the determination of the SARS-CoV of specimens. In this paper, we report a microfluidic chip system to detect this virus in clinical specimens.",

Subsequently, the pair glass plates were placed between two pieces of smooth China plates and annealed in a Model SX3-4-10 programmable furnace (Zhonghuan Test Electrical Furance, Tianjin City, China). The temperature program was as follows: initial heating to 1007C for about 1 h, and to 6207C for about 3 h, followed by natural cooling of the furnace to room temperature. The channels were typically 20 mm deep and 50-60 mm wide at half-depth. The separation length was 3.0-3.5 cm. For forming reservoirs connected to the microchannels, the 2 mm diameter holes in the top glass plate (either substrate or cover plate) were drilled by the CK-250L ultrasound driller (Shantou Goldstar Ultrasonic Machinery, China). The typical volume of the reservoirs was 15 mL.",

The channels were filled with a sieving buffer solution for microchip gel electrophoresis after they were oxidized in boiling H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2 (1:1) for 10-15 min, followed by washing with deionized H 2 O. The coating was stable for multiple injection/separation cycles and provided reproducible separation performance. For DNA fragment sizing, 2.5% PVP solution in a 100 mM Tris/100 mM boric acid/2 mM EDTA buffer was used. An intercalating dye, SYTOX Orange nucleic acid stain, was added to the polymer solution at 1 mM for the PCR on-chip experiments. A DNA marker containing 11 DNA fragments of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1500 bp at approximately equal weight/volume concentration was used for PCR verification, product size determination, and estimations of the amplification efficiency. For the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, the LIF microfluidic chip analyzer was used. For the conventional injection/separation cycle, the sample was first loaded into the sample reservoir and then injected by applying 400 V/cm at the sample waste and grounding the sample reservoir for 30 s. The buffer and waste reservoirs had no potentials applied since the low diffusion coefficients of DNA fragments in the polymer sieving medium resulted in no substantial increase in the injection plug length or deterioration of separation channel. The relative potentials were switched to 0, 1.1, 0.3, and 0.3 kV at the buffer, waste, sample, and sample waste reservoirs, respectively. Figure 2a shows a picture of the thermal cycler for the micro-PCR device, which was designed and built inhouse using two Peltier thermoelectric devices (1 inch6 1 inch, output power of 30 W). Aluminum cooling flakes are attached to the backside of the Peltier devices as heat sinks. A small cooling fan was also attached to each of the two aluminum blocks for convective cooling. During PCR thermal cycling, the 2/3 area of the entire chip was sandwiched between the two Peltier elements. The device temperature and Peltier surface temperature were monitored using thermocouples. Software inhouse made was used for thermal cycle temperature control. A drop of mineral oil on the bottom Peltier element ensured good thermal contact with the cycled region of the chip. All microchannels and reservoirs, excluding the PCR reaction area (including sample reservoir) in Fig. 1 , were filled with sieving solution. The reaction well was first treated with 2.5 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 2-3 min to modify the inner glass surface of the milled reservoir. The BSA was then removed from the well and replaced with 3.5-4 mL of the PCR reaction mixture (individual or duplex PCR reaction mixture and cDNA of the sample). To prevent evaporation, all wells were topped with 6-7 mL of mineral oil. The temperature steps were 947C for 2 min, followed by 94, 55, and 727C with holding times of 45, 30, and 30 s for 30 cycles, and then 727C for 2 min to perform DNA amplification. The top thermoelectric element of the thermal cycler for the micro-PCR device was not placed in direct contact with the chip in order to eliminate the requirement of sealing the top reaction reservoir against contact-driven capillary wicking. Thus, the top assembly was positioned over the chip using 0.5 mm thick graphite strips as spacers. 4 N.A.) . The emission signal is collected by the same objective and transmitted back through the dichroic beam-splitter. The emission beam passes through a bandpass filter (Omega Optical), which may be alternated easily to fit a wide selection of dyes, and is focused by a focusing lens through a 400 mm pinhole. The photomultiplier tube (R212; Japan) is mounted in an integrated detection module including high-voltage power supply, voltage divider, and amplifier. The chargecoupled device (CCD) camera was fixed at the same board as the photomultiplier tube in order to focus and observe the channel. The whole optical system was installed on the X-Y-Z translational stage (3-D micro-manipulator, adjusting precision 1 mm), and the focus can be controlled via the picture displayed on the screen.",

Multiplex PCR is a modification of the basic PCR method, where multiple pairs of primers are used in the same reaction [19, 20] . A multiplex protocol appears to be useful for the investigation of different target sequences at the same time. By RT to cDNA and subsequent amplification, the RNA template can also be amplified by multiplex PCR. The SARS RNA genome is apt to mutation, which may lead to primers ill-matched with templates. Multiplex PCR, which can effectively reduce the possibility of false-negative PCR results caused by genome instability, amplifies different regions at the same time. So we designed nine pairs of primers according to the Tor 2 SARS genome sequence, and 2 of 9 pairs of primers were optimized as the primers for RT-PCR SARS-CoV assay kit. The sequences of two pairs of the primers are 5'-TAGGATTGCCTACGCAGACT-3' and 5'-AGAGCCATGCCTAACATGCT-3' (for the 240 bp product), and 5'-ATTGGCTGTAACAGCTTGAC-3' and 5'-TAG GGTAACCATTGACTTGG-3' (for the 438 bp product), respectively. The concentration of Mg 21 , enzymes, reaction time, cycling times, etc., for RT-PCR SARS-CoV assay kit were optimized.

However, the thinnest glass cover plate of the bottom of every reservoir is easily shattered, particularly during installation of the electrodes. Therefore, the thickness of the glass cover plate was kept thin (0.5 mm) in order to achieve a reasonable thermal cycle time. The temperature cycling of the PCR chip in a dual Peltier assembly is represented by trace curve in Fig. 2b , which shows the temperature profile for five cycles of the program inhouse software. The Peltier surface temperature and intra-reservoir temperature were measured by thermocouples. A built calibration chip contained an embedded thermocouple to assess the intra-reservoir temperature and compare it with the temperature of the Peltier surface. These data were used to design the thermal cycle profile of amplification experiments. The chips used in the experiments did not have the embedded thermocouple.
