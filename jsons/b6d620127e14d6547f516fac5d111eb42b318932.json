Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures -organisms -which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms' reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multi-dimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase. Brain evolution enabled representation of space and time, which vastly enhances this process. Some of these channels lead to tiny, dead-ends in the state space: the persistence of complex life is thus not thermodynamically guaranteed. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2",

One is the second law of thermodynamics, stating that entropy always increases; the other is Darwin's theory of evolution.

For example, entropy increases when matter spontaneously becomes more evenly dispersed, as when two initially separated gases intermingle. Similarly, the flow of heat down a temperature gradient, another entropic process, occurs because the distribution of kinetic energies of the particles becomes more spatially mixed. At their core, these processes are statistical: freely moving particles are more likely to distribute themselves in a random unstructured way throughout a space than in a more ordered way, simply because there are more possible disordered than ordered states. Boltzmann quantified entropy as the number of microstates that can give rise to the same macrostate [3] : for spatially structured systems, such as the separated gases or the hot and cold objects, there are fewer ways in which the component particles or particle velocities (microstates) can be arranged and still preserve that structure, and so entropy is lower.",

For example, mixed oil and water will spontaneously separate, and the resulting separated state has higher entropy. This is because the movement of the water molecules under gravity displaces the oil's drops upwards, liberating energy that raises the temperature: although there are fewer places the particles can be, there are more velocities J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 available to each particle and so the number of possible microstates is still higher 1 . Entropy is thus not fundamentally about macroscopic order/disorder as is often assumed -it is about probability, and the tendency of systems to move towards more probable macroscopic states over time. For some systems such as stars, galaxies and life itself, a structured state is more probable than a dispersed state, given certain conditions (such as gravity).",

A tree, for example, may persist apparently stably for years until a lightning strike ignites it and it transitions suddenly to a new, higher entropy state. The lightning can be thought of as opening a channel in the \"skin\" of the bubble that allows the dammed entropy stored in the tree to suddenly flow up to a new, higher bubble.

This idea assumes that the special structures that characterize life necessarily have low entropy. However, the discussion above suggests that life can be more like oil and water or a fusion star or a black hole: it is a higher-entropy structure in its own right (see [2] for a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 more detailed discussion of this argument): life formed because, given the laws of physics and the conditions of the present-day universe, it is more probable than non-life. The structure and order of life do not necessarily mean lower entropy, because entropy can, as we saw, increase even in processes that generate order. nucleic acids, which have the property of being able to replicate their sequences [6] . From this moment forwards, evolution became a ratchet in which the self-copying preserved, over time, the stable structure of useful new molecules (where \"useful\" means, circularly, \"facilitates the self-copying\"). This self-sustaining process was initiated and enabled by the spatial properties of carbon atoms which can, due to their tetrahedral bond arrangement, polymerise stably to form long chains. Because of their flexibility, these molecules enable new chemical interactions to occur by bringing the substrates into close spatial contact.",

By 2.6 billion years ago cells had already evolved voltage-and ligand-gated ion channels, receptor-kinase-transcriptome signalling and the ability to regulate the translation of genes to proteins [10]. They also evolved intracellular transport systems made from microtubules, which allowed molecules to be moved around and brought together at the optimal time and place for their reactions. These intracellular systems were then co-opted to form flagella Evolution then discovered that extensive non-sexual interaction between cells also confers significant fitness benefits, and multicellular organisms began to appear [12] . The first of these were relatively undifferentiated (as are modern sponges for example) but then differentiated organisms started to form, in which functions are spatially segregated as organs, or temporally organised as sequences (e.g., during development). These required new interactions on the genome, in which genes such as the homeobox genes [13] came not only to encode proteins but also to regulate each other and create large-scale spatial structure, as well sequencing of developmental processes, in the organism.",

Once animals began to move over large distances, a new selection pressure emerged: the difference in survival potential of some regions of the environment relative to others. Organisms that could exploit these differences by storing information about how to navigate to beneficial regions were hugely advantaged, and so internal spatial representation was born.

This recognition can be hardwired, as when insects move towards light, but it can also be learned from experience. A more sophisticated form of spatial representation requires encoding not just where things are in relation to the body, called egocentric coding, but of where they are in the world independent of self-location, called allocentric coding. An organism navigating allocentrically needs a representation of both direction and of distance so that it can form a two-dimensional map of the spatial layout. The sense of direction is an ancient capacity that long pre-dates vertebrates: a neural compass has been discovered in insects that resembles, in important respects, the one that exists in mammals [24] . To self-locate, however, an J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f animal also needs to detect distance travelled and to combine this trigonometrically with the direction of travel [25, 26] , meaning an animal can return to the start point of its journey. Evolution of this \"path integration\" capacity, which is widespread among animals, including even insects [27] , allows motile animals to form home bases that they can return to [28] , providing a huge survival advantage (which we can think of as new bubbles in the state-space that have enhanced self-replication and persistence).",

This is not a one-way J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 process -it is a purely statistical one that can proceed in either direction, as the numerous mass extinctions of life in the past attest. Its apparent directionality towards increasing complexity arises from the fact that life began in a state of low complexity, such that statistically, in the early universe complexity more likely grows than declines because there are more complex than simple states to evolve towards. However, unlike entropy, indefinite complexification is not inevitable [41] . The chemical interactions mediating photosynthesis allowed free energy from the sun to be captured in vast quantities and used to fuel the other processes supporting self-copying \uf0b7 Membranes and microtubules Membranes allowed the self-copying processes to be protected from the environment; microtubules allowed energy and materials to be moved around inside cells, and eventually also to move the cells themselves The fast signalling enabled by neurons greatly extended the ability of multicellular organisms to develop complex adaptive behaviors, while synaptic plasticity extended their influence across time, enabling the events of the past to be used to predict (and thus adapt to) the future.",

With the evolution of the first membranes and cells, chemicals could be compartmentalised so that their reactions were shielded from the perturbations of random interactions with the environment [7], which greatly enhanced their efficiency and stability. The evolution of ATP, which occurred at the very beginning of life [8], enabled environmental free energy to be collected and stored so as to power chemical reactions at a time and place to optimise stability and replication. In a sense, ATP extends across time to capture free energy and make it available in the future, while second-messenger systems extend across space and move the energy around a cell. The evolution of photosynthesis, which may have occurred around 3.5 billion years ago [9], greatly enhanced these reactions by enabling capture and storage of the vast influx of free energy from the sun.",
