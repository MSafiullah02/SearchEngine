A series 2D projection images are collected at 1\u20132\u00b0 intervals and aligned with each other and then back-projected to generate 3D images [1, 2].",

An alternative to chemical fixation is high pressure freezing in combination with freeze substitution, providing better preservation of the ultrastructures [3]. Electron cryotomography (cryotomog) eliminates fixation entirely and approaches resolution in the 4-nm range. Samples are preserved in vitreous ice by flash freezing and then examined with low electron doses while maintaining cryoconditions. Cryotomog minimizes artifacts introduced during sample fixation, dehydration and staining, and therefore preserves structures in a virtually native state. Cryotomog can be applied to small prokaryotic cells without sectioning or to regions of eukaryotic cells that are flattened [1, 2]. Analysis of larger cells requires, technically challenging, cryosectioning [4].",

            "text": "ET requires only the combination of different views of the same entity with no averaging of different objects, making it a superior method to analyze pleiomorphic objects. Some medically important viruses (e.g. influenza and HIV) are pleiomorphic, prohibiting the use of crystallography or electron cryomicroscopy with image reconstruction (cryo-EM). ET characterizations of purified viruses revealed the structural complexity of HIV, Influenza, Hanta and Herpes etc. [5, 6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, ET can identify asymmetric structural changes inside symmetric objects. The method allowed visualization of the specialized DNA packaging vertex in the icosahedral HSV capsid [9, 10], the geometry of the poliovirus capsid releasing its genome [11], the structural changes of the tail machinery of Epsilon15 upon injecting its genome [12], or the conformational changes of hemagglutinin molecules of influenza virus upon fusing with liposomes [13]. A significant issue affecting the images generated by ET is the \u2018missing wedge\u2019 of data caused by the 140\u00b0 physical limit associated with the tilts. This causes significant artifacts in certain, predictable, regions of the image [1]. The problem can be reduced with multiple tilt axes and, if applicable, performing sub tomographic volume averaging. The latter can significantly improve the resolution if objects are sufficiently uniform to be averaged. The growing applications of ET to characterize virus structures and various stages of the virus life cycle in vitro and in vivo have been well documented in several reviews [14, 15, 16]. Here we emphasize recently published work on viruses. Tomographic studies of viruses from 2010 to date are listed in the Table 1\n.",

The viral polyprotein Gag assembles on the interior cell membrane and recruits other viral components and the RNA genome, as well as the host ESCRT machinery necessary for the subsequent viral budding. The immature form of the virion undergoes series of proteolytic cleavages by the viral protease and converts into an infectious mature particle. While the virions are pleomorphic, repeating patterns in the particle surface lattice were characterized and enhanced by sub tomographic averaging [17]. This allowed the Gag lattice in the immature virions to be reconstructed to 17 \u00c5 and revealed that the incomplete hexagonal lattice packing creates curvature through symmetry defects with irregular shape and size. Upon proteolytic cleavage of Gag the lattice maintains its largely hexagonal organization but loses its defects, and rearranges to incorporate pentameric CA capsomers for curvature, creating the characteristic cone shape of the mature capsid core [18, 19, 20]. By studying Gag mutations abolishing cleavage at individual or multiple cleavage sites, the structural transformations corresponding to the maturation process were revealed in significant detail [21].",

The precursor membrane of the virus is recruited by viral proteins to generate open membrane crescents that coalesce to form spheroid sacks that eventually form the envelope for the virus. The incorporation of the DNA leads to particles with a \u2018nucleoid\u2019 subsequent transformation into the mature virus. The latter stage involves an extreme rearrangement of the particle envelope in which the original recruiting viral gene products are lost. The entry of vaccinia virus into mammalian cells was also characterized by cryotomog and showed that viruses undergo distinct structural rearrangements of the core and its surface spikes as well as de-condensation of the viral DNA upon binding to the cell surface [33\u2022].",

The structure of the major capsid protein (MCP) is conserved across three domains of life, from adenovirus, and vaccinia virus, to bacteriophage PRD1 [35]. The assembly process of this inner-membrane-containing virus was revealed in intact Sulfolobus cells by whole cell cryotomog (Figure 3\n) [36\u2022\u2022]. The partially assembled particles were observed in which the curvature and protein-membrane layer spacing resemble those of fully assembled particles. These intermediates support the model of assembly in which the capsid shell and the membrane are tightly coupled by defined local interactions as assembly proceeds. Similar to the assembly of immature vaccinia viruses, the interactions of the lipid membrane with capsid, and possibly other trans-membrane proteins, appear able to maintain the energetically unfavorable open-ended membrane structures [31, 32]. Indeed the high level of structural homology between the STIV MCP and the vaccinia D13 protein that recruits and shapes partially formed membrane structures is striking. This similarity in membrane recruiting subunits closely reveals comparable roles in STIV and vaccinia viruses but with different outcomes, that is STIV MCP forms membrane-containing viruses while vaccinia D13 is a scaffold that leaves the membrane during virus maturation and is not present in viruses (Figure 4\n). The power of cellular ET to disclose transient assembly and maturation intermediates, which may not be preserved in purified samples, is well illustrated by this example.",

The study clearly showed an empty precursor particle assumed to be the substrate for packaging enzymes analogous to bacteriophage. At the resolution of the sub tomographic reconstructions it did not appear that DNA packaging in STIV induced large-scale capsid transformation as observed in bacteriophage. It was clear that the turret-like structures at the fivefold vertices seen in the mature viruses were already assembled in the procapsid particles before genome encapsidation. The high image quality of cellular tomograms and robust computational analysis allowed intracellular STIV arrays to be analyzed in exceptional detail, including the precise orientation of the particles within particle arrays. Particles in the arrays were packed tightly and mainly consisted of virions. Procapsids (lacking dsDNA) were only found on the edge of the arrays or not associated with the arrays at all. The arrays of STIV may accommodate DNA and packaging enzymes where capsid assembly and genome packaging are tightly coupled. Virus factories or viroplasm have been reported in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems where proteins and newly synthesized genomes are confined within specific compartments for efficient viral replication and assembly [37, 38, 39]. The arrays observed in STIV may provide an environment for dsDNA packaging and maturation.",

A similar rationale has driven the incorporation of the tetracysteine motif into a protein of interest. This motif induces fluorescence when it binds to biarsenical compounds (FlAsH and ReAsH) allowing specific targeting with light microscopy [48, 49]. Following photo-conversion and osmium staining, an insoluble osmio-philic precipitate forms around the fluorescent target making it visible by EM. The approach was applied to follow the assembly of flock house virus in insect cells [50]. It allowed viral arrays to be visualized with both fluorescence and EM analysis and showed that heavily modified mitochondria were the sites of viral RNA replication. In vivo labeling strategies applicable to cryotomog have also developed recently. Metal-binding proteins such as metallothionein (MT) or ferritin can be fused to target proteins as can proteins that will bind to gold clusters or heavy metal ions that can be visualized with EM [51, 52, 53]. Analogous to GFP used in fluorescence light microscopy, the metal-binding tags allow identification and localization of target proteins in the context of fine ultrastructures in tomograms.",
