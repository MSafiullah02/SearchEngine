In chickens, turkeys and ducks colibacillosis is often observed secondary to infection with respiratory agents e.g. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Newcastle Disease Virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Igbokwe et al., 1996, Nakamura et al., 1994). In mice, influenza virus increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (Seki et al., 2004, Speshock et al., 2007) and measles virus predisposes for a range of bacterial infections such as Listeria monocytogenes (Slifka et al., 2003). In cattle, susceptibility for pneumonic pasteurellosis is greatly enhanced by a variety of respiratory viruses including bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Liu et al., 1999), bovine herpes virus-1 (Leite et al., 2002) and bovine coronavirus (Storz et al., 2000). In man, pneumonia has been a leading cause of death during influenza pandemics, supporting the widely held view that influenza virus predisposes for streptococcal infections (McCullers, 2006).",

A first set of hypotheses suggests increased susceptibility due to tissue damage in the respiratory tract resulting in functional impairment. Three possible causes have been described as mechanisms for functional damage. Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract causes loss of cilia and ciliated cells (Bakaletz, 1995), decreased ciliary activity impairs mucociliary clearance (Wilson et al., 1996) and finally, damage to epithelium may provide more attachment sites for bacteria (Ahmer et al., 1999).",

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was eluted in 30 \u03bcl RNase-free water and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Reverse transcription was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) were designed according to Kaiser et al. (2003) and Rothwell et al. (2004) and are listed in Table 1\n. For the quantitative RT-PCR assay TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. Primers were used at 300 nM and probes at 100 nM concentration. Amplification and detection of specific products was achieved with the MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the following cycle profile: one cycle of 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, one cycle of 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s and 59 \u00b0C for 1 min. Results were expressed as fold changes between samples, relative to the PBS group (Philbin et al., 2005). To correct for variation in RNA preparation and sampling, Ct values for cytokine-specific product for each sample were standardized using the Ct value of 28S-specific product for the same sample. To normalize RNA levels between samples within an experiment, the mean Ct value for 28S-specific product was calculated by pooling Ct values of all samples in that experiment. Well-to-well variations in Ct value of 28S-specific product about the experimental mean were calculated. The slope of the 28S dilution series regression lines was used to calculate differences in input of total RNA. Fold differences in cytokine expression between treatment groups were calculated relative to the reference ribosomal RNA, using a method adapted from Philbin et al. (2005). Fold differences were calculated from the CT values C (for the cytokine) and C\u2032 (for ribosomal RNA) using the equation log10 R(A/B)=[(CA\u2212CB)/S]\u2212[(C\u2032A\u2212C\u2032B)/S\u2032], where S and S\u2032 are, respectively, the slopes of plots of CT value against the 10logarithm of concentration for serial dilutions of cytokine DNA and ribosomal RNA, assayed on the same plate. This calculation avoids assumptions about the efficiency of the PCR amplifications and reduces to the common \u0394\u0394CT method in the case that both have perfect efficiency.",

In a separate paper, we addressed the question whether local changes at the surfaces of the trachea, lung and airsacs might facilitate local bacterial growth and subsequent entry of bacteria. The results of that study showed that the clearance of the bacteria from the lung was comparable for all the groups inoculated with E. coli, irrespective of previous exposure to virus (Matthijs et al., submitted for publication).",

For this question, NO production by mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen and PBMC were tested. After E. coli inoculation, the NO production in samples upon stimulation with heat-killed E. coli bacteria or E. coli LPS (data not shown) was strongly increased in all groups, irrespective of prior exposure to IBV, although at 1 dpi the increase was highest in IBV-inoculated birds. Another difference was observed at 7 dpi, where birds exposed to E. coli alone showed diminished NO production compared to birds also exposed to either IBV strain (M41 or H120). This is in line with the clinical picture of bacterial persistence in broilers previously exposed to IBV.",

The upregulation in spleen samples was only found in the E. coli group and is likely due to the fact that the bacteria are not retained in the respiratory tract but spread systemically. Surprisingly, in the IBV groups no IL-8 mRNA is found in the spleen, which might suggest that a lack of response in the spleen can contribute to prolonged colibacillosis.

IFN\u03b3 is a potent macrophage-activating factor and IL-18 is an important inducer of IFN\u03b3 production (Wigley and Kaiser, 2003). Both IFN\u03b3 and IL-18 are strongly linked to a cell-mediated Th1-like immune response (Staeheli et al., 2001). IL-10 on the other hand is a promotor of Th2-like immune responses, predominantly by inhibiting pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines (Rothwell et al., 2004), which can increase host susceptibility to bacterial diseases through its anti-inflammatory effects, including suppression of macrophage function. Previous studies in chickens showed that IL-10 production could be accompanied by either downregulation of IFN\u03b3 production (Abdul-Careem et al., 2007, Rothwell et al., 2004), but also by concurrent upregulation of IL-10 and IFN\u03b3 (Hong et al., 2006). Moreover, it should be noted that IL-10 is known to have immunostimulatory effects in certain species, inducing MHC class II upregulation and cytotoxic T-cell stimulation (Groux and Cottrez, 2003).",
