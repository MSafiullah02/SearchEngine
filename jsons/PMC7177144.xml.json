The mean age was 67 years (range, 62-70 years) and their medical history was consistent for hypertension (all), diabetes mellitus (one case) and obesity (one case). Chest radiography (evidence of bilateral infiltrates) and laboratory blood findings (increased high sensitivity C-reactive protein, lymphocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin) performed on admission were significant for SARS\u2013CoV-2 infection and the nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis. On admission they required oxygen support HcPAP due to important desaturation (Table 1\n). All patients received empirical antibiotic and antiviral treatment, supportive therapies and antithrombotic prophylaxis. The patients developed upper limbs edema and UL-DVT (axillary and omeral) diagnosis was made by Duplex scan (monolateral, right in 2 cases; bilateral in 1 case). The mean time from admission to start of HcPAP and from start of HcPAP to UL-DVT diagnosis was 2 hours (range, 2-4 hours) and 40 hours (range, 24-48 hours) respectively. All patients had normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and platelets (PLT) count. Conversely, fibrinogen (mean 647.3 mg/dL; range 562-695 mg/dL) and D-dimer values were increased at the admission (mean 11572.7 mcg/L; range 6226-18552 mcg/L) (Table 1). At the DVT diagnosis, anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 100 U/Kg twice daily was started and patient 1 died 3 days later due to pulmonary embolism.",

Albeit a good knowledge has been gained on the correlation between DVT and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in which the coagulation cascade is activated in response to several \u201cinflammatory storm\u201d, less clear information has been provided between SARS-CoV-2 and DVT2\n,\n3. In a case-control study on Whuan patients it was observed that on admission antithrombin (AT) and PT values were found to be significantly lower in SARS\u2013CoV-2 patients than in controls, whereas the values of D-dimer (10.36 vs. 0.26 ng/L; p < 0.001) and fibrinogen (5.02 vs. 2.90 g/L; p < 0.001) were higher and were associated with poor prognosis as in our series. No other differences could be observed in values of aPTT and PT between the two groups (p > 0.05)4. Moreover, Tang et al have suggested that early application of LMWH prophylaxis improves outcome only in selected patients (severe SARS\u2013CoV-2 infection) that meet sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer in which the dysfunction of endothelial cells with thrombin generation, fibrinolysis shutdown and increased blood viscosity secondary to hypoxia5 are known.",
