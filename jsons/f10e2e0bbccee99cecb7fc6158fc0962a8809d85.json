            "text": "For the purpose of this section, we define postinfectious hemolytic uremic syndrome as HUS [1] caused by specific infectious organisms in patients with no identifiable HUSassociated genetic mutation or autoantibody. Major triggers of postinfectious HUS are Shiga toxin (Stx) producing bacteria (STPB, mainly Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae type 1) [2, 3] and neuraminidase (NA) producing organisms (mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae) [4, 5] . Stx and NA are thought to injure vascular endothelial and perhaps circulating red blood cells and platelets leading to thrombotic microangiopathy with intravascular hemolysis (TMA). In children, more than 80 % of cases of HUS are due to STEC infection. This contrasts with HUS causally linked to the deficiency of proteins that regulate the alternative pathway of complement, either due to genetic mutations or the presence of autoantibodies (mainly to complement factor H), or to other genetic and metabolic causes (Box 26.1). However, HUS can arise following infection by a \"specific\" agent in a patient with a complement defect; the \"atypical\" nature of such HUS is usually uncovered by its atypical presentation (relapsing course, recurrence after transplantation or family history). The historical terms diarrhea-positive (D + ) and diarrhea-negative (D \u2212 ) HUS, introduced to distinguish STEC-induced HUS from \"atypical\" forms, should be abandoned since at least one third of patients with complement-mediated \"atypical\" HUS present with diarrhea or even colitis [12] . The D + /D \u2212 dichotomy fails to differentiate postinfectious forms, such as S. pneumonia HUS, from \"atypical\" HUS, and could delay the necessary workup and potentially deprive patients of effective treatment. An etiology-based classification is preferred.",

            "text": "It was not until 1983 when two major discoveries led to the recognition of a specific microbial etiology as the predominant cause of HUS in children: Dr. Karmali and his group from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada reported the isolation of Escherichia coli strains from children with \"idiopathic\" (typical) HUS that produced a filterable agent that was toxic to cultured Vero (African Green Monkey kidney) cells (verocytotoxin or VT) [2, 17] . VT detected in the stools of children with HUS (free fecal VT) and lysates from VT producing E. coli (VTEC) [18] were neutralized by convalescent patient and rabbit immune sera [2, 17] . In the same year, Dr. Allison O'Brien from the Armed Services, Bethesda, recognized that a toxin, elaborated by a newly described E. coli strain (E. coli O157:H7), bore close similarity with the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Shiga toxin) which she termed Shiga-like toxin (SLT) [19] . The prototypic disease caused by E. coli O157:H7 became known as hemorrhagic colitis [20] [21] [22] [23] and the organism was termed \"enterohemorrhagic E. coli\" or EHEC. Subsequent work by Karmali, O'Brien, Karch and others showed that verotoxin, SLT and the classic Shiga toxin belonged to a family of closely-related bacterial protein exotoxins with the major subdivisions of SLT-I or VT1, now termed Stx1, and SLT-II or VT2, now termed Stx2 (and variants) [24] as outlined in Table 26 .1. We will use the terms STEC-HUS, Stx-HUS or enteropathogenic HUS (eHUS) to describe patients with the \"typical\" or \"classical\" form of HUS.",

EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli) are defined by the disease they induce in humans, bloody (hemorrhagic) colitis [45] . STPB (Shiga toxin producing bacteria) encompass STEC and S. dysenteriae type 1 (SD1), and the occasional Citrobacter freundii [46] [47] [48] [49] , Salmonella or Shigella (enterobacteriaceae) isolates capable of Stx production [50] .",

A complete cohort was available for Alberta, the Canadian province with the highest incidence of STEC infections. The risk of HUS after E. coli O157:H7 infection in Alberta was 8.1 % (95 % confidence interval, 5.3-11.6). The highest agespecific risk of HUS or hemolytic anemia was 12.9 % in young children <5 years of age [69] . This contrasted with a reported HUS risk of 31.4 % in participating tertiary care centers outside Alberta most likely reflecting referral bias; it highlights the need to critically read epidemiological studies in this field. In another CPKDRC study, 34 consecutive children with HUS were enrolled at 8 hospitals over a 4-month period; 16 patients were treated with dialysis (47 %), and 1 patient died (2.9 %).

A comprehensive review of 350 outbreaks of STEC O157:H7 infections in the United States between 1982 and 2002 [99] identified 8598 cases; 17 % of the patients were hospitalized, 4 % developed HUS, and 0.5 % died.

Of the foodborne outbreaks, 41 % were due to ground beef, and 21 % due to produce [99] . The role of processed meat as the predominant outbreak vehicle is diminishing, and more recent, large epidemics were due to contaminated well water [100] or agricultural produce, such as bean sprout (Sakai outbreak) [101, 102] , lettuce [103] and fenugreek [63, 104, 105] .",

Examples of surveillance networks are the CDCsponsored FoodNet (http://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/) consisting of a network of pediatric nephrologists and hospital infection control personnel that catches 15 % of the US population with sites in ten states [142, 143] , the Food-and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses Network (FSW-Net), FoodNet Canada [144] , Eurosurveillance of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm, Sweden (www.ecdc.europa.eu/), the \"Institut de veille sanitaire\" in France [145] , and the OzFoodNet network in Australia (www. ozfoodnet.gov.au/) and others worldwide. These networks and their on-line and print publications are valuable sources of up-to-date trends and outbreak information.",

Of note, coagulopathy, measured as thrombin generation, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, intravascular fibrin deposition and other events can be demonstrated well before -or even in the absence of -the clinical manifestation of HUS [148, 149] . STEC counts and free fecal toxin excretion often diminish or become undetectable during early, acute stages of HUS [115, 150, 151] . The amount of measurable, circulating toxin is extremely low. The difficulty of measuring active toxin in the circulation is likely due to its avid binding to the (microvascular) endothelium, and to plasma proteins or glycolipids. Shiga toxinemia has been demonstrated 24 h after the experimental (oral) inoculation of streptomycin-treated, starved mice with a large dose of the highly virulent Stx2d-producing E. coli O91:H21 strain B2F1 [152] . Intravascular binding of circulating toxin by neutralizing antibodies or receptor analogues decreased Stx-induced mortality in these mice when the Stx neutralizing agent was injected during the first 72 h after inoculation [152] [153] [154] [155] .",

STEC virulence factors are encoded by genes located in mobile genetic elements (prophages, genomic islands, plasmids) that can dramatically alter the virulence of E. coli [195] . A revised classification by Kobayashi et al. [194] differentiates STEC strains according to \"clusters\" 1 through 8 that are defined by virulence gene profiles. In addition to genes located in LEE, the authors identified both katP and stcE as key attributes of the top pathogenic STEC genotypes. Despite up to 80 % overlap with the seropathotype classification, the proposed \"clusters\" may more accurately reflect the virulence potential of a given isolate [194] .",

The toxins' lectin-like recognition and binding to Gb3 (Gal\u03b11-4Gal\u03b21-4Glc ceramide) induces the formation of lipid rafts with clathrin-coated pits that mediate the internalization of membrane-bound toxin into the target cell. Gb3 is identical with CD77 or the P k blood group antigen [206] [207] [208] [209] (Fig. 26.3a, b) . There are subtle differences between Stx1 and Stx2 and its variants in their affinity to Gb3 and related glycolipids that influence binding to susceptible tissues and intracellular cell sorting [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] . However, these differences do not easily explain why severe disease and HUS are more often associated with STPB producing Stx2 (or Stx1 and Stx2) [216] . Not all Stx subtypes have been isolated from humans with colitis or HUS ( showing the sequential addition of carbohydrates represented by the glycan symbol system (Used with permission of Elsevier from Bergan et al.

It is found on microvascular endothelial cells (including glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium), glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), platelets and germinal center B-lymphocytes [219] , and peripheral and central neurons [220, 221] . Only the efficient transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent rRNA depurination result in cell toxicity. Platelets, and possibly red blood cells (RBCs), can bind Stx (and LPS) [208, 209, 222, 223] .

The A subunit is nicked by the intracellular protease furin [241] and is chaperoned to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the disulfide bond linking the A1 and A2 fragments is reduced. Stx endocytosis and transport to the Golgi apparatus are facilitated by various second messenger (phosphorylation) events that include Stx-induced tyrosine kinases as well as remodeling of cytoskeleton components [198, 242] . The processed A1 fragment then cleaves a specific adenine residue from the 3\u2032 region of the 28S rRNA of the mammalian 60S ribosomal subunit of actively translating ribosomes. Loss of the adenine residue causes a conformational change of the ribosomal RNA resulting in the effective inhibition of protein biosynthesis in toxin-sensitive cells [243] ( Fig. 26.4 ). Very few molecules are needed to paralyze the cell making it one of the most potent known toxins.",

The observed biological effects are tissue dependent. For example, bovine intestinal epithelial cells express Gb3 but are insensitive to Shiga cytotox- The holotoxin binds to lipid raft-associated membrane globotriasosyl ceramide (Gb3) and enters the cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A and B subunits become disengaged and the A submit is cleaved and activated by intracellular furin. Upon \"retrograde\" passage through the Golgi apparatus, the A\u2032 subunit selectively removes a specific adenine residue from the 28S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit (N-glycosidase activity). This results in (1) blockade of active (translating) ribosomes (translational inhibition), and (2) a ribotoxic cellular stress response with activation of c-jun and p38 (MAP) kinases and/or apoptotic cell death (Used with permission of author and Elsevier from Loirat et al. [244] . Copyrighted by Martin Bitzan) icity, possibly due to their sorting of the toxin to lysosomes instead of the endoplasmic reticulum [254] . Other tissues that are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of Stx may still respond with an \"activated\" phenotype [255] [256] [257] [258] . These effects are in part mediated by an Stx-induced increase in mRNA stability and enhanced protein expression of select (inducible) mRNA transcripts [255, [257] [258] [259] .",

Intracellular signaling occurs at the plasma cell membrane following Stx binding to Gb3 via the pentameric B-subunit resulting in lipid raft formation, during the course of retrotranslocation of the Stx A subunit, and/or as a result of the purine residue cleavage at the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop of the 28S rRNA [198] . It has become evident that Stxmediated protein synthesis inhibition is dissociated from cell death signaling and cytotoxicity and that the ribotoxic stress response induced by ribosomal depurination or by the presence of unfolded proteins within the ER (ER stress) induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) [260, 261] . Initiation of apoptosis entails multiple changes to cell morphology, such as cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic vacuolization, chromatin condensation (pyknosis), nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), phosphatidylserine exposure at the plasma membrane, cell blebbing and extrusion of apoptotic bodies [261] . Stx-induced apoptotic signaling is believed to occur mainly via the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway. It is regulated by B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins and results in the downstream activation of cysteinedependent aspartate-directed proteases (caspases) and the deactivation of anti-apoptotic proteins [198, 248, [261] [262] [263] [264] . Pharmacological blockade of MAP kinase and its upstream kinases weakens the Stx-induced cytotoxic (apoptotic) effect in vitro [245, 248, 250, 265] .",

Stx (and LPS) interact with platelets, monocytes and neutrophils, and possibly RBCs and plasma proteins (serum amyloid proteins) or glycolipids [205, 223, 225, [272] [273] [274] [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] . There is little evidence that Stx modulates neutrophil or monocyte function under in vivo conditions [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] . The previously postulated \"transfer\" of toxin from low affinity receptors on circulating leukocytes to high affinity receptors on small vessel endothelial cells [274, 285, 286] may be (too) simplistic [279, 287] . However, investigators have demonstrated more recently that Stx (and LPS) induce the formation of platelet and monocyte microparticles loaded with tissue factor and complement [223, 288] . Biologically active microparticles and (direct) Stx-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells, including the externalization of plasma membrane phosphatidylserine [289] , may provide a mechanism how localized (colon) or systemic microvascular thrombosis is initiated in the gut and kidney [290] . Endothelial cell injury or activation may induce or modulate vasoactive mediators, including chemokines and their receptors [255, 258, 259, [290] [291] [292] [293] [294] which would then result in a prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive endothelial phenotype known as thrombotic microangiopathy.",

Some antibiotics, such as (fluoro)quinolones, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) and others lead to prophage induction and Stx production by several orders of magnitude within 2-4 h [342] [343] [344] [345] . The SOS response is initiated when damaged bacterial DNA binds and activates the (bacterial) RecA protein. Activated RecA induces the degradation (cleavage) of key repressor molecules, LexA and CI, leading to the temporary arrest of DNA synthesis, cell division and error-prone DNA repair. Cleavage of the CI phage repressor/activator protein results in the coordinately regulated induction and expression of previously silent phage encoded genes (including Stx A and B subunit genes), the production of phage particles, and bacterial cell lysis [330, 340, 345] . Experiments in mice infected with RecA mutated STEC strains [341] have demonstrated the importance of the bacterial SOS system under in vivo conditions.",

Testing for serum antibodies to Stx has been used as an epidemiological tool [97, 369] , but its diagnostic utility in the clinical setting is limited [142] . Additional STECexpressed or secreted proteins may elicit an antibody response [370] , but are rarely used diagnostically. Serological tests are generally offered in reference laboratories (Table 26. 3).",

Relying on a clinical diagnosis (\"D + HUS\") and omission of microbiological testing is inadequate. A prerequisite for the correct microbiological diagnosis is the dialogue with the microbiologist. The diagnostic workup should not be limited to free Stx [377] . Where available, stool samples should be screened (by PCR) for Stx genes and/or specific STEC \"virulence\"-associated genes. In the absence of microbiological evidence of STEC, serological testing for serum or saliva IgM or IgA antibodies against defined O-group (LPS) antigens or other virulence proteins may aid in the diagnosis. Although new and more sensitive diagnostic techniques continue to be developed, a combination of methods will still be necessary for optimal yield [353, 378, 379] .",

The HUS risk is greatest at the extremes of age, in children <3-5 years and the elderly [115, 132, 380] ; it decreases during childhood and adolescence, and is <0.1 % in young and middle aged adults. Conversely, STEC colitis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and death without the picture of HUS, particularly in the elderly [380, 381] . Other variables impacting on the HUS risk are the STEC serotype or clone (as outlined above), the toxin type(s) produced, and preexisting immunity [97, 387] . Experimental animal data indicate that a high Stx \"load\" exceeding binding to natural protectants and acquired antibodies, is the major precipitant of HUS [152] .",

Patients who progress to HUS demonstrate significantly more often a peripheral neutrophil count in excess of 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L than patients with colitis only [125, 129, 389, 390] . Human and experimental animal data suggest that STEC infection as well as parenteral Stx administration induce a cytokine response that mediates some of the observed pathological effects [293, 301, [391] [392] [393] . Some, but not all inbred mouse strains [299] require the combination of Stx and added LPS or TNF-\u03b1 to produce an HUS-like disease [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] , while no such dependency on added cytokines was noted in primate models of HUS [392, 393, 400, 401] .",

Rising indirect bilirubin, free plasma hemoglobin and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (the latter often more than five times the upper normal), and haptoglobin depletion are consistent with a rapid hemolytic process. The peripheral white blood cell (neutrophil) count, already increased during the colitis phase, may continue to rise and, if associated with a leukemoid reaction, can herald a severe course with poor intestinal or renal outcome [68, 308, 410] . The severity of anemia and thrombocytopenia does not correlate with the degree of acute or chronic kidney injury. Some authors noted an inverse relationship between hematocrit (Hb level) and disease severity [410, 411] . A plausible explanation for the latter observation is the hemoconcentration seen in patients with intravascular volume depletion during the first 4 days of STEC colitis [402, 410] . A retrospective study of 137 children with STEC-HUS from Argentina, performed to determine whether dehydration at admission is associated with an increased need for dialysis, indeed showed that \"dehydrated\" children had a higher rate of vomiting and an increased risk of being dialysed than normovolemic children (70.6 versus 40.7 %, P = 0.0007) [412] .",

Signs and symptoms can be vague and nonspecific, and are probably underappreciated. Patients may present with irritability, lethargy or decreased level of consciousness; short seizures are relatively common and may reflect fluid and electrolyte imbalances related to AKI and inadequate volume replacement. Abnormal electroencephalograms have been reported in up to 50 % of patients with HUS. Prolonged seizure activity, usually associated with acute respiratory deterioration or palsy, is an ominous sign and may indicate a cerebral stroke or hemorrhage. Acute, transient or persistent (isolated) palsy, dysphasia, diplopia, retinal injury or cortical blindness has been noted [426, 438] . Evident neurological complications or \"catastrophic\" events are associated with a poor prognosis [426, 439] .

In the acute phase, basal ganglia and white matter abnormalities with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) restriction are a common and reversible MRI finding. They consist characteristically of bilateral hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted sequences located in the basal ganglia and thalami, and can extend to the white matter [443] ; they can be associated with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images of basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem [427, 428, [443] [444] [445] [446] (Fig. 26 .6a-f). However, the described changes do not appear to be specific for STEC-HUS and often revert over a period of weeks or months [443] . Images can be variable, with or without ADC decrease due to the presence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or hemodialysis in addition to primary, Stx or STEC-HUS induced lesions [443] .",

Potential strategies are the elimination of STPB from the gut, the binding of free Stx prior to its translocation into the circulation and/or neutralization in the blood stream, thus minimizing the amount of toxin injuring the vascular endothelium. Additional strategies have targeted the coagulation system to prevent microvascular thrombosis and ischemia. Although some of the earlier trials were underpowered, none of these strategies have shown convincing results or promising clinical signals [244, 475, 476] . The conduction of definitive, randomized controlled HUS prevention trials of any intervention in a conventional format is extremely challenging due to the low prevalence of STEC infections and the overall low risk of progression to HUS [153, 403, 477, 478] .",

In a retrospective cohort study of 29 unselected children with E. coli O157:H7 HUS, Tarr and his group [402] showed that patients who became oligoanuric and needed dialysis had received significantly less intravenous fluid during the first 4 days of diarrhea than children who had preserved urine output and who were not dialyzed. The authors concluded that early parenteral volume expansion before the onset of HUS attenuates AKI and reduces the need for dialysis. The original findings were reproduced in a prospective multicenter cohort of 50 children with STEC O157:H7 colitis. The treated group received a median volume of 1.7 (0-7.5) vs. 0 (0-4.9) L/m 2 (P = 0.02) and 189 (0-483) vs. 0 (0-755) mmol sodium/m 2 surface area (P = 0.05). None of the enrolled patients required ventilatory assistance because of acute pulmonary edema or other volume-related complications [403] . The authors postulated that the oligoanuria of HUS results from renal parenchymal hypoperfusion and ischemia using the analogy of myocardial infarction; and that intravenous volume expansion is an underused intervention that has the potential to decrease the frequency of oligoanuric renal failure in patients at risk of HUS [403] . Support for the \"volume hypothesis\" comes from an indepen-dent study from Argentina [479] and observations linking higher Hb concentrations at presentation with severe HUS, including neurological complications [405, 411] . The administration of isotonic solutions is not expected to affect bacterial toxin production, delivery into the circulation and target tissue binding; however, the intended alleviation of incipient AKI is plausible in view of similar strategies commonly used to prevent or ameliorate acute tubular necrosis and AKI in other scenarios involving potentially nephrotoxic agents [480, 481] . In addition, there are hints that saline infusion may also mitigate the abdominal cramps caused by STEC induced ischemic colitis [482] . Figure 26 .8 shows an abbreviated, practical algorithm to estimate the individual child's risk of HUS, initial (minimal) investigations (stool culture, CBC, renal function, and electrolytes) and the size of the isotonic saline bolus (20 mL/ kg body weight) as soon as STEC colitis is diagnosed or suspected [65, 372] . The risk of fluid overload and cardiopulmonary complications due to saline infusion is minimal, provided the patient is hospitalized and supervised diligently by an experienced team [403] . Hospital admission does not only simplify patient monitoring, it may also alleviate parental anxiety and reduce the spreading of the potentially dangerous organisms from the family and community (see above) [349, 350] .",

Children infected with the outbreak strain, who were given fosfomycin within the first 2 days of illness (diarrhea), developed HUS significantly less often than those who did not receive antibiotics (adjusted OR 0.15; CI 95 % 0.03-0.78). In contrast, fosfomycin started on and after the third day of illness was not associated with HUS prevention [390] . Others suggested a beneficial effect of oral fluoroquinolones compared with IV or PO fosfomycin during the same outbreak [497] .

However, the benefit of PE in eHUS remains unproven [476, [540] [541] [542] , unless aHUS is suspected [348] . The European Paediatric Study Group for HUS excluded other forms, specifically STEC-HUS, from this form of invasive therapy [348] . In young children, PE necessitates the insertion of a large-bore central venous access (hemodialysis line), which confers additional morbidity to children not already undergoing HD [409] .",

The investigators hypothesized that the agent, administered orally soon after the diagnosis of HUS, would diminish continued toxin absorption and result in disease amelioration. Primary endpoints were decreased rates of death, serious extrarenal events and dialysis frequency. The trial was stopped when the interim analysis revealed no difference between treatment and placebo groups. Several consideration may explain the negative trial outcome: (a) the binder may not reach the site of toxin production and delivery by STEC that adhere tightly to the mucosa via \"attaching and effacing\" lesions [566] , (b) the binding affinity and capacity may have been insufficient and/or the chosen dose too small, and (c) the timing after HUS onset may have been too late.

The first reports predated the recognition of the central role of STEC infection in children with (typical) HUS. Several authors described glomerular deposition of C3 in (kidney) biopsies obtained during the acute phase of HUS [587] . Nonetheless, the majority of eHUS patients demonstrate C3 serum levels within the reference range. The employment of more sensitive assays confirmed the activation of complement in eHUS. For example, Monnens et al. detected elevated levels of breakdown products of the two components of the alternative pathway C3-convertase, C3 (C3b, C3c, C3d) and CFB (Ba) in the serum of children with \"post-diarrhea\" HUS [585] . More recently, increased plasma levels of the CFB activation product Bb and the soluble form of the terminal complement complex sC5b-9 were demonstrated in 17 children with acute STEC-HUS that normalized by day 28 of the disease [588] . Comparable results were obtained in a Swedish cohort of 10 children, all of whom displayed elevated C3a and sC5b-9 (terminal complement complex) concentrations in plasma as well as C3 and C9 bearing, mainly platelet-derived microparticles (measured as mean fluorescent intensities) during acute STEC-HUS that normalized with disease recovery [223] . A detailed case study of one patient with acute eHUS by the same authors revealed the presence of C3, Stx2 and LPSO157 on a larger number of platelet-neutrophil and platelet-monocyte complexes (by flow cytometry) compared with healthy controls [223] . The cited findings suggest the recruitment of complement components, together with Stx and bacterial LPS, on the surface of platelets [589] and, to a lesser degree, neutrophils and monocytes, and alternative pathway activation in acute STEC-HUS [223] . Stahl et al. speculated that while complement activation is not the primary event occurring during EHEC infection, it may contribute to blood cell activation and renal injury, through the release of microparticles, free radicals and cytokines. Deposition of the terminal complement complex (TCC or sC5b-9), demonstrated in post-mortem tissue from a child with STEC-HUS (Fig. 26 .9a-f) further suggests that complement is activated in this disease. Interestingly, no correlation was found between the levels of activated complement products in plasma or on platelet derived microparticles and the presence or absence of renal or extrarenal complications [223, 588] .",

Endothelial complement deposition and loss of thromboresistance was dependent on Stx-induced P-selectin expression and high-affinity C3 binding and alternative pathway activation [399, 591] , and was blocked by a P-selectin antibody and the P-selectin soluble ligand PSGL-1. The findings were reproduced in the authors' mouse model of HUS induced by the combined injection of Stx2 and LPS [399] . The absence of CFB (injection of genetically modified mice deficient of CFB with Stx2 and LPS) mitigated the degree of thrombocytopenia and protected against glomerular microangiopathy and renal function impairment, further supporting the involvement of alternative pathway of complement activation in this HUS model [399] .",

To their surprise, the authors failed to discover significant increases in soluble terminal complement complex levels (TCC or SC5b-9) after lethal challenges with Stx1 or Stx2 [595] . Complement activation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were, however, evident in baboons with sublethal E. coli bacteremia. Complement inhibition with compstatin, a peptide that prevents C3 cleavage and activation, reduced consumptive coagulopathy, inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the bacteremia model, and improved cardiac and renal function [596, 597] . It should be remembered, however, that bacteremia is not a feature of (typical) childhood STEC-HUS.",

Apart from its role in aHUS, evidence is emerging for an involvement of TM in STEC-HUS. Experimental data indicate that TM expression is decreased in Stx2 exposed human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells that had been sensitized with pro-inflammatory mediators [590] . In the Bergamo mouse model of HUS, induced by the combined injection of Stx2 and LPS, reduced glomerular TM expression was observed in association with fibrin and platelets deposition [399] . Zoja et al. further demonstrated that mutation of the lectin-like TM domain worsened murine Stx-HUS [607] . Mice lacking the lectin-like domain exhibited excess glomerular C3 deposition indicating impaired complement regulation and local generation of complementderived, pro-inflammatory peptides, such as the chemokines C3a and C5a. Binding of C3a to endothelial cells leads to impaired endothelial thromboresistance and may contribute to the TMA in the authors' model [399] .",

However, there is no doubt that Stx itself can injure the microvascular endothelium and trigger the activation of various cellular and plasmatic cascades, including the platelet/ coagulation and complement systems. With a few documented exceptions [612] [613] [614] , STEC-HUS patients do not have underlying complement regulator deficiencies or autoantibodies, nor does the generally acute and self-limited course justify treatment with anticomplement agents [141] .",

The cited European registry study [91] defined \"poor\" outcome as the presence of arterial hypertension (systolic or diastolic blood pressure >95th percentile according to age, sex, and height), neurological abnormalities (seizures, coma, stroke, or delayed motor development), impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), or presence of proteinuria (positive dipstick analysis or proteinto-creatinine ratio >0.15 g/g). Based on these criteria, 30 % of 274 prospectively followed patients were found to have sequelae 5 years after the initial diagnosis: 9 % of the study population had persistent hypertension, 4 % neurological symptoms, 18 % proteinuria without or with (7 %) decreased eGFR. Of importance, hypertension and proteinuria was noted in 18 % of patients who had been free of renal sequelae at the end of the first year following HUS (CI 95 % 0.12-0.26) [91] .",

Children with SD1-HUS can demonstrate impressive neutrophilia and left shift [635, 641] . As with STEC-HUS, a high peripheral neutrophil count has been associated with the development and severity of HUS [649, 653] . Some patients manifest the full DIC picture [3, 654] . Although STEC can induce subtle coagulation activation [148] , full-blown DIC is not seen in STEC-HUS in the absence of gangrenous or perforating colitis and secondary sepsis or peritonitis. Morbidity and mortality of SD1-HUS appear to be substantially higher than of HUS due to STEC infection [636] . The estimated case fatality rate is 36 % and by far exceeds that of shigellosis without HUS [635-637, 641, 655] . According to some authors, HUS has emerged as the principal cause of death in epidemics of SD1 dysentery [636] . However, S. dysenteriae is endemic in areas with limited resources and access to health care, and affected children may be malnourished and suffer from additional morbidities [656] . Severe fluid volume loss, hypernatremia and lack of dialysis may contribute to the previously reported poor outcome, described particularly in Sub-Saharan epidemics.",

SD1 Stx is encoded in a defective lambdoid prophage unable to become lysogenic, which leads to constitutive Stx production [25, 637, 657, 658] . Thus, exposure of S. dysenteriae type 1 to antibiotics is not expected to increase Stx expression via phage induction. However, bacterial killing by antibiotics and subsequent lysis could augment stool toxin concentrations. In an attempt to estimate the risk of HUS attributable to antibiotic use, investigators at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh analyzed a welldefined group of children with SD1 infection who were treated early in the course of illness. Free fecal Stx levels decreased after the administration of antibiotics in 85 % of enrolled children, and none of the studied patients developed HUS [637] .",

The list of antibiotics used in these studies comprises nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, cefixime, ampicillin and other betalactams, and azithromycin. A single child, treated with ciprofloxacin, developed HUS, corresponding to a calculated risk of 0.004 (95 % CI 95 % 0.001-0.022) in children and of 0.0026 (95 % CI 95 % <0.001-0.015) in all participants. For persons with S. dysenteriae type 1 colitis, early administration of effective antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones, is associated with decreasing Stx concentrations in stool and a low risk of HUS [637, 659] .

In all instances with appropriate viral diagnostic, HUS was associated with influenza A strains, mainly A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) ( Table 26 .7). The first retrievable description is from a 20 year-old kidney transplant recipient, from 1971 [707] . The patient was diagnosed with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and graft failure 1-2 weeks Mutation of C3 (Transplant recipient); iHUS in third graft [709] ; relapsing HUS (native kidney) without identified complement mutation; fourth episode triggered by influenza A/H1N1 infection [715] ; decreased C3 (complement mutation studies not reported) [713] c Graft loss (transplant recipient); deceased patient excluded after the onset of influenza, almost 2 years after transplantation; additional laboratory features included cold agglutinins (with negative direct Coombs test) and transiently reduced plasma C3 concentration. A graft biopsy 5 weeks after HUS onset revealed thrombosis of small renal arteries and glomerular capillaries. The graft was removed 8 weeks after HUS onset, followed by swift normalization of the hematological parameters. A subsequent graft from a deceased donor (DD) was tolerated well without recurrence of HUS. Several cases of iHUS were noted during the pandemic influenza A(H1N1). A typical scenario is that of a previously healthy, 7-year-old boy with febrile pneumonitis and transient respiratory failure who developed severe AKI, profound microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with hypertensive encephalopathy 5 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms. Coagulation profile, plasma fibrinogen, Coombs test and C3 concentration were normal as was the screening for MCP expression, plasma ADAMTS13 activity and CFB, CFH and CFI concentrations. He recovered completely after 2 weeks of peritoneal dialysis [710] . Additional patients with influenza A-associated HUS demonstrated elevated d-dimers [688, 711, 712 ]. None of the tested patients had a positive Coombs test [689, 707, 708, 710, 713, 714] , but cold agglutinins were reported once [707] . It is currently unclear if A(H1N1) has a greater propensity to induce HUS than other influenza strains.",

Three patients were found (or suspected) to have genetic complement regulator defects: a 15 yearold boy with a gain-of-function mutation in the C3 locus, who had lost two previous kidney allografts due to HUS recurrences (treated with eculizumab) [709] , a 17 year-old boy with reduced plasma C3 and heterozygous CD46 deficiency (second episode of HUS) [714] and a 15 year-old girl with incomplete genetic workup (normal C3 and C4, factor H, and factor I levels, undetectable CFH autoantibody, and lack of CHF mutation), who had four preceding spontaneously resolving episodes of HUS (Table 26 .7) [715] . In these instances, HUS should be viewed as \"atypical,\" triggered by influenza A infection. The remaining nine patients, including a transplant recipient with HUS, had no preceding episodes of HUS. Thus, the majority of the reported cases iHUS appear to occur spontaneously, without known complement regulator defect. However, only two of the reported patients have been screened for alternative pathway regulator abnormalities. The question, whether genetic (host) factors confer susceptibility and whether complement plays a role in iHUS warrants further studies.",
