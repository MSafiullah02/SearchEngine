With the loss of jobs, consumer spending decreases, which in turn causes other businesses to suffer and more people to lose their jobs. Retailers that offer value-oriented brands and discount retailers are likely to benefit from this situation, at least during this economic downturn, while luxury and high-end retailers will likely suffer. It will be important for retailers to understand what consumers view as being essential and what they consider to be a luxury. It is critical for these nonessential or luxury retailers to continue building their brand and engaging with customers online.",

Before the pandemic, many in-store customer experiences were centered on creating fun, entertainment, and engagement. After the pandemic, consumers may evaluate their experience in a store based on how clean the store is, not having to touch a screen, and whether the store is spacious enough to allow social distancing. In restaurants they may want disposable menus and significant space or even plastic barriers between tables.",

In this issue, we are pleased to include a commentary on product returns by three experts. In retailing, we often focus on front-end selling and overlook the back-end returns. Product returns account for a sizable portion of total sales resulting in significant processing costs for both manufacturers and retailers. At the same time, returns are also being used as a strategic tool by retailers for increasing sales. In their commentary, three academic experts highlight recent developments in product returns from a retailer perspective, many enabled by technology, discuss their strategic implications, and identify future research directions (Robertson, Hamilton, and Jap, 2020) .",

In this context, conventional wisdom suggests that consumers are less willing to part with their (observable) physical cash for buying than with their (non-observable) e-payment. Therefore, cash payment results in more price discounts than non-cash payments. Contrary to this belief, Xu, Chen, and Jiang (2020) find that cash payment led to a higher selling price than e-payments under certain conditions. They further investigate and explain this result through consumers' mental imagery and desire for money.",

No longer are such goods privileged purchases of the rich and the elite, but they have also made inroads among the middle-and lower-class consumers. Singlebrand and multi-brand luxury stores, especially on the web, have been catering to the wide range of luxury consumers. Desmichel and Kocher (2020) find that multi-brand store consumers tend to engage in more brand/price comparisons because the stores have larger assortments compared to single brand consumers. Therefore, they suggest that multi-brand luxury store managers should take greater effort to promote hedonic shopping experience among consumers to make them less price-sensitive and improve the profitability of the stores.",

This fairness perception may be mediated by the consumers' perception of the firm's market power. Lu et al.

Fairtrade goods are those that are procured to help farmers and local communities, and these goods are generally higher priced. Marketers of Fairtrade goods engage in occasional price cuts to move products. However, such price cuts may be viewed with suspicion because the discounts take away money designed for social purposes. Kim and Han (2020) find that consumers more committed and involved with fair trade, and hence likely to be loyal to such goods, tend to question the price discount on these grounds. Whereas, less involved consumers of Fairtrade goods may view the price discount positively. The implication is that discounts especially aimed at involved consumers should provide justification to mitigate its potential negative impact, an important insight for cause marketing.",

The answer to this question depends on what kind of products are being sold ! Choi, Madhavaram, and Park (2020) find that, compared to combined pricing, partitioned pricing increases hedonic purchases, but not utilitarian purchases. This dichotomy happens because consumers considering a hedonic purchase tend to feel guilty about spending money on unnecessary pleasure, and partitioned pricing reflecting lower actual prices is used as a vehicle to justify the spending and alleviate the guilt. So, partitioned pricing is better when selling hedonic goods.",

This effect is driven by a \"Shape-SES\" lay theory that a person's body shape is associated with his or her socioeconomic status -tall being more attractive and reflective of status.",
