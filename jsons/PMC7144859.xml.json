Stock market returns may also respond to epidemic diseases, for example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Chen et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2009), and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak (Ichev and Marin\u010d, 2018). However, there is scant research on the extent to which epidemic diseases interact with stock returns.",

(2020), on 31 December 2019, there were several cases of pneumonia presenting with flu like symptoms in Wuhan. It is believed that the first cases are linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China (Sohrabi et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020). The first death from the virus was reported on 11 January 2020 (Pharmaceutical Technology, 2020). In the same month, the Chinese authorities rolled out containment measures with extreme quarantine, including closing off large cities, borders, and restraining people to their homes to limit the spread of COVID-19 (Yang et al., 2020). By early March 2020, there were signs that the containment measures adopted in China were having the desired effect with consistent falls in the numbers of new cases (John Hopkins University, 2020) and most of the new temporary hospitals in Hubei had closed (Pharmaceutical Technology, 2020).",

The principal novelty of the present study is the examination of the effect of contagious infectious diseases, specifically the COVID-19 virus, on stock market returns. As stated, the outbreak started on 31 December 2019, and since then, the number of infected cases has been published on a daily basis. To investigate the effect of this epidemic on stock returns, we employ a panel regression approach using two measurements: (1) daily growth in total confirmed cases and (2) daily growth in total deaths caused by COVID-19.",

Our further tests suggest that some sectors performed better than others during the outbreak of the COVID-19, specifically, information technology and medicine manufacturing sectors. We also find that B-shares which are designed for foreign investors face a significant higher negative effect on the returns in comparison with A-shares which are traded only by Chinese citizens. Finally, high market capitalization stocks face a significant higher negative effect on the returns in comparison with low market capitalization stocks. The implications of our study are important for stock market main players to understand and predict the behaviour of stock market returns during epidemic diseases.",

Baltagi (2008) and Hsiao (2014) suggest that panel data regression reduces estimation bias and multicollinearity, controls for individual heterogeneity, and identifies the time-varying relationship between dependent and independent variables. We therefore apply panel testing to examine the relative performances of stocks in relation to COVID-19, while controlling for firm-specific characteristics. We estimate stock returns as: (1)DRi,t=\u03b10+\u03b11C19i,t\u22121+\u03b2Xi,t\u22121+\u03b5i,t,where DRi,t is the return of stock i at day t, regressed on the lagged previous daily values of firm return predictors, which are C19i,t\u22121, is either (1) daily growth in total confirmed cases or (2) daily growth in total cases of death caused by COVID-19. Xi,t\u22121 is a vector of firm-specific characteristics and \u03b5i,t is the error term. Xi,t\u22121 includes the natural logarithm of daily market capitalization (LMCAP) and daily market-to-book ratio (MTB).",
