There is increasing recognition of the importance of sharing knowledge between the many actors involved in and affected by disasters to reduce risks from emergencies [2]. The exchange of knowledge across health systems is crucial during a rapidly evolving emergency or incident that presents potential risks to community health and wellbeing [3,4]. Emerging public health incidents (EPHIs) are \u201call-hazards events caused by infectious disease, natural or anthropogenic causes with the potential to overwhelm or otherwise disrupt routine local capacities due to their timing, scale or unpredictability.\u201d [5]; 2) Knowledge exchange is a considerable challenge during EPHIs due to many factors, such as the uncertainty attributed to novel incidents, the diverse actors involved in response, and resource and time constraints. Knowledge and information-sharing is a key part of emergency management and contributes to building preparedness and resilience for future events. Despite the importance of knowledge exchange, there is a lack of understanding of the role of tacit knowledge in guiding communication and decision-making during EPHIs. Illuminating features and roles of tacit knowledge in health provider and system decision-making and communication has potential practical relevance in enhancing strategies for knowledge management related to EPHIs, and broadening the understanding of legitimate knowledge about these events.",

The concept was first explored in depth by sociologist Michael Polanyi in the 1960s when he argued that a significant part of human knowledge and skill is derived from informal understandings and abilities that underlie conscious thought, and are transmitted through culture and history, rather than direct teachings [6]. This form of knowledge is often difficult to articulate or transmit to others, as its role in shaping judgements and corresponding actions, is often taken-for-granted by the actor [7,8]. The concept of tacit knowledge has been used to highlight experiences and learning that occur over time, and represent an embodied and often intuitive form of action [9]. It has been described by others as \u201cnot simply doing by learning, but doing as a form of learning,\u201d to highlight that learning frequently occurs without the conscious intention to learn, or even the realization that learning has taken place [9]; p. 4).",

Furthermore, tacit knowledge is frequently understood as both individual and social in nature [9,11].

The sustained experience of work environments allows people to see beyond discrete tasks and interactions and to determine how they fit into the broader structure of the organization or political context. It additionally enables people to develop networks of accessible contacts to draw from to address particular problems and acquire the social skills required to work collaboratively. Importantly, tacit and explicit knowledge are intimately interconnected and tacit knowledge can be seen as providing the tools to know when to trust explicit knowledge [12]. From this perspective, these two categories overlap and tacit knowledge influences social exchanges through a complex interaction between both \u2018formal\u2019 and \u2018informal\u2019 knowledge [13].",

Despite the fact that these forms of knowledge are reported as the preferred mode by which some clinician groups make decisions, communicate, and take action [15], the reliance on evidence-based decision-making by most health-related disciplines and fields has promoted a narrow focus on knowledge which can be tested and standardized. To overlook tacit forms of knowledge is to deny a key dimension of action, the dynamic nature of knowledge, and in turn exclude an important resource for public health. As Kothari et al. [7] note, the privileging of explicit knowledge can also have the effect of diminishing locally grounded knowledge in public health. Recognizing the value of experiential knowledge is potentially important for the adaptation of evidence so that it is relevant and compatible with specific local environments [9,14].",

Previously, there has been evidence of barriers to knowledge exchange between these two settings. For example, during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Ontario, evolving public health directives on disease exposures during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation), failed to be appropriately translated into acute care settings, thereby greatly increasing the risk of infection of health care workers [20]. Retrospective work on this issue suggests that this was, in part, a result of inadequate engagement with local knowledge and provision of feedback to clinicians, where guidelines failed to incorporate the experiences of frontline staff [21]. With this in mind, research that explores the role of tacit knowledge in guiding communication and decision-making during EPHIs, has the potential to contribute to greater collaboration between these settings to more effectively guide action. Greater knowledge of this area could improve uptake of public health guidance in hospital settings, but also facilitate the integration of health care providers' experiences into public health practice guidelines.",

Participants described a complex arrangement of formal processes that guided their public health communications and actions, but also drew extensively from a more informal set of tools to facilitate knowledge exchange. This is consistent with evidence on the importance of relationship-building as part of emergency risk communication more broadly [22]. The field of emergency management is adapting to acknowledge greater emphasis on skills and approaches that value tacit knowledge and improve relationships to promote \u201cpeople-centred\u201d approaches and reframe traditional hierarchies in decision-making [13,23]. Weichselgartner & Pigeon [13] analyzed conceptualizations of knowledge to advance disaster research and policy using French case studies, and found gaps and fragmentation of knowledge within these platforms and policies. In this context, their analysis supports the need for a movement towards a shared risk knowledge that is both understandable and actionable by a diverse range of knowledge users. There is similarly increasing recognition of the importance of social infrastructure in enhancing resilience of communities and organizations to the impacts of emergencies and disasters [3,4].",

In the context of EPHIs as evolving and uncertain, participants built from previous experiences, and direct observation in the field, to determine the expedient and appropriate course of action. Furthermore, our research shows that participants actively facilitate public health action in EPHIs through tacit knowledge, in their development of strong relationships that enable direct communication and knowledge of the local setting, and cultivate trust. At the same time, the lack of formal guidelines due to evolving knowledge, and subsequent reliance on tacit knowledge, sometimes posed a challenge in the face of the urgency that many EPHIs pose, as did the potential for inconsistencies in public health actions across settings. Tacit knowledge (connection to local settings) also allowed for the observation of discrepancies in practice across different contexts.",

Relationship-building to promote communication was generally used as an informal strategy chosen by participants to better perform their duties, rather than a formal mechanism within the public health or emergency department setting. Strong relationships facilitate access to settings, which can be important for effective emergency management, and understanding why public health information may not be appropriate for a specific environment.

Participants in these areas described regular staffing changeovers that further necessitated frequent informal communication, greater accountability for decision-makers due to smaller populations and less anonymity, and alluded to a perception that some public health guidance or directives may be less relevant to the local rural or remote context. Where greater informal communication is needed, people may rely on their local knowledge and past experience working with remote or rural practitioners to build trust and rapport. These findings point to the need to carefully consider local factors when applying guidance and standards to rural settings, as resistance to a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 standardization when urban centres are perceived as making decisions for rural peripheries (e.g., for travel-related EPHIs such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Ebola virus disease) can represent larger power differences between both contexts.",

As history has repeatedly demonstrated, emergencies do not impact local populations equally, due to a range of social, economic and political factors [[41], [42], [43]]. Attempts to include diverse perspectives and experiences to better understand differences in resilience need to be grounded in social contexts and driven by community. Other research has contested a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 response to disaster planning by emphasizing the importance of participation by local communities in such activities [44,45]. At the same time, many barriers exist that prevent participation, including lack of trust in actors and institutions that typically initiate such processes [46]. Similarly, the lack of integration of local stakeholder knowledge into fields such as disaster risk reduction, reflects engrained and unequal relations of power that need to be unpacked and acknowledged in order to increase inclusivity in decision-making processes [13]. Tacit knowledge has the potential to reflect a deeper understanding of how inequity or deprivation is uniquely experienced in local contexts, which is significant for understanding how these inequities might undermine resilience.",

Traditional forms of scientific evidence can be difficult to generate when data collection and study design efforts are limited during responses to EPHIs for a variety of reasons (e.g., diversion of resources away from research or time constraints). Processes that rely on intangible concepts such as intuition or judgment, may be more difficult to codify for an organization or part of the health system. Debriefing after emergencies often focuses on explicit knowledge and does not necessarily capture the breadth of knowledge acquired during public health and health system responses to emergencies. For example, the development and functioning of relationships and teams may be difficult to articulate as part of a formal debrief.",

Similar approaches may be useful in further explicating dimensions of tacit knowledge useful for practitioners, such as how to make decisions about and act on public health guidance in diverse local contexts when responding to specific EPHIs (e.g., natural disasters versus emerging infectious disease.",

An obvious example of this was the frequent description of personal relationships that facilitate communication in these settings. Despite these individualized accounts, the sharing of tacit knowledge at the organizational level has significant potential to contribute to organizational resilience. Rhem [47] acknowledges the importance of tapping into tacit knowledge as a strategy for knowledge management in the aftermath of emergencies, and provides a number of different ways to achieve this. For example, \u201cexternalization\u201d refers to the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge through outputs such as best practices, or tips and techniques. \u201cSocialization\u201d refers to the process of sharing tacit knowledge, using collaborative methods such as individual or group meetings. A similar approach is the use of \u201cstorytelling\u201d to elicit the tacit knowledge of subject matter experts to strengthen organizational capacity and ensure that this type of knowledge is not entirely dependent on individuals [48]. This can be a useful tool for understanding people's experiences of the field and informal processes that may be extremely valuable to practice, yet not captured in organizational materials or protocols.",

In this paper, we have outlined what the dimensions of tacit knowledge are in this context, and have identified some challenges that result from the use of tacit knowledge in EPHIs. Our findings suggest that the dimensions of tacit knowledge should be a key consideration for public health decision-making, particularly in identifying opportunities to facilitate preparedness and response. Furthermore, planning related to EPHIs would benefit from considering strategies to manage differences in action across different settings, including addressing inequities. To our knowledge, no research has examined the relationship between tacit knowledge, health and social equity, and EPHIs, which points to an important opportunity for developing knowledge in this field.",
