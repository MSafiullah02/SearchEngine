Urinalysis showed many leucocytes and positive nitrates and a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was made. The patient was kept overnight in the medical center, and she was started on intravenous saline and gentamicin 60 mg every 8 h, after obtaining urine and blood cultures. The patient's weight was estimated to be about 65 kg. Two hours later the patient was stable with a blood pressure 100/70 pulse 120/min and temperature of 38.5 C.",

            "text": "It has long been recognized that symptomatic urinary tract infection is more common in pregnant than non-pregnant women. Several factors are believed to play a role. The upper ureter and renal pelvices become dilated, resulting in a physiologic hydronephrosis of pregnancy. This is a result of effects of progesterone on muscle tone and peristalsis on the urinary collecting system, and the mechanical obstruction by the enlarged uterus. There is also decreased bladder tone, increased capacity, and incomplete emptying of the bladder, all factors that predispose to vesicoureteric reflux. The hypokinetic collecting system reduces urine flow and predispose to ascending infection from the bladder to the kidneys. 5 Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most serious complications in pregnancy and is a threat to maternal and fetal well being. Several studies have confirmed the association between acute pyelonephritis and the increased risk of premature delivery. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The association of acute pyelonephritis and preterm delivery was known from the pre-antibiotic era with prematurity rates of up to 20-50%. 5 The proposed mechanisms include oxytoxic-like effect of endotoxin on the myometrium causing uterine contractions; high fever by pyrogens may increase myometrial activity, uteric contractions may result in reflex myometrial contractions, and the endotoxin may cross the placenta and produce fetal effects resulting in premature labor. Asymptomatic bacteriuria alone probably has no harmful effects unless it leads to symptomatic pyelonephritis.",

Bacteremia occurs in 15-20% of women with acute pyelonephritis, and the sepsis syndrome is common. 11 Kidney infection was the second most common reason for non-delivery admission, 4 per 100 in one study of 833,264 hospitalizations for pregnancy complications. 13 Admissions for preterm labor (33%) were the most common reason for hospitalization, followed by genito-urinary infections (16%). In another survey of 46,179 pregnancies, 3.5% required antepartum admission for acute pyelonephritis. 14 Urosepsis also is the leading cause of septic shock in pregnancy, predominantly due to E. coli. 15 Over a 2-year audit at the Parkland Hospital Obstetrics intensive care unit, 12% of the admissions were for sepsis syndrome caused by acute pyelonephritis. 16 The overall incidence of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy is about 1-2.5%, with an estimated recurrence rate of 10-18% during the same gestation. 5 Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the major predisposing factor and others include obstructive uropathy, neurologic disease, renal calculi, and the need for catheterization. Screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria decreases the risk of pyelonephritis significantly in pregnant patients. 17 In a prospective study over a 4.5-year period, over 2% of 24,000 pregnant women were admitted for acute pyelonephritis. 18 Chills, fever, and back pain were the most common complaint in 656 women, while lower urinary tract symptoms, nausea, and vomiting were very common. Documented fever was present in 96% and costovertebral angle tenderness was positive in 97% (27% were bilateral). 18 In most (67%) of these women, pyelonephritis occurred during the last two trimesters; but 8% were diagnosed intra-partum and 19% occurred post-partum. Of 501 women with antepartum pyelonephritis, the pregnancy outcome was spontaneous abortion in 5, stillbirth in 4, neonatal death in 2 (for a prenatal mortality of 12 per 100), and 133 (23%) developed recurrent acute renal infection. 18 A more recent longitudinal study over 2 years from the same center (Parkland Hospital, Dallas) reported on 440 cases of acute antepartum pyelonephritis (1.4% incidence). 12 Acute pyelonephritis occurred most often in the second trimester (53%) with E. coli accounting for 70% and group B Streptococcus in 10%. Complications included anemia (23%), septicemia (17%), transient renal dysfunction (2%), pulmonary insufficiency (7%), and 43 (10%) required admission to the intensive care unit (indicating severe sepsis syndrome). 12 In a retrospective review of 18 patients with septic shock during pregnancy, the causes were acute pyelonephritis (33%), chorioamnionitis (16%), post-partum endometritis (11%), toxic shock syndrome (11%), and miscellaneous conditions (27%). 15 The incidence of septic shock was 1 per 8,338 deliveries, with a mortality of 28% (N \u00bc 5), and of nine women delivering while septic, only two babies survived with significant morbidity. However, three patients delivered 15-20 weeks after the episode of septic shock had uncomplicated deliveries. Of the 14 pregnancies that reached viability (!24 weeks gestation), perinatal mortality was high (29%). 15 ",

Gentamicin levels (pre-and post-therapy) used to be recommended to assess toxic concentrations when multiple daily doses were in vogue. In pregnancy, there was an increase in vascular volume and the volume of distribution with enhanced glomerular filtration rate, resulting in a high prevalence of sub-therapeutic levels. With the advent of single dose of aminoglycosides, sub-therapeutic levels are no longer a problem as 3-5 mg/kg is given once daily. In this instance, the trough level only is assessed, and should be 0 to <2 mg/mL. In animal models, single daily doses of aminoglycosides are associated with less toxicity and may be more effective, but clinical studies have been less convincing (probably from small sample sizes). 19 Sub-therapeutic trough levels of aminoglycosides given for a few hours once a high peak level is achieved is probably not therapeutically important, as the aminoglycosides have a prolonged post-antibiotic effect on coliforms (inhibition of the bacteria even after the antibiotic is removed) and the rate of killing is concentration dependent. It should be noted that in patients with renal impairment, the initial dose would be same as for normal renal function, but the subsequent dose or dosing interval would be adjusted according to the trough level and estimated gentamicin clearance.",

Before adoption of routine prophylaxis for C-section, the incidence of uterine infection was dependent on social economic status; 13% in affluent (especially white) women and from 27% to 50% in indigent women. 21 In women with high-risk delivery (prolonged rupture of membranes/labor, multiple vaginal/cervical examinations, internal fetal monitoring, cephalopelvic disproportion), serious pelvic infections after C-section (without antibiotic prophylaxis) occurred in up to 90%. 21 Other risk factors for puerperal infection after C-section include race (African-American), bacterial colonization of the vagina with certain organisms (group B and A Streptococcus, bacterial vaginosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardineralla vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis), young age and nulliparity, obesity and multifetal gestation. 21 Wound infection post-C-section typically occurs 4-7 days postoperatively, but certain infections with virulent bacteria (group A Streptococcus and clostridial species) can appear within 2 days of surgery. The pathogenesis of wound infections are mainly of two sources, inoculation of the wound from the skin (Staphylococcus aureus), or endogenous inoculation from ascension from the vagina (mixed infection, group B Streptococcus, etc). Group A Streptococcus can be either externally from skin colonization via oropharynx, or from vaginal or rectal (rare) colonization.

Complete integrity of the fascial suture line should be assessed, and a more serious necrotizing fasciitis can be excluded by early surgical intervention. Usually the wound is liberally irrigated by sterile saline and packed daily with sterile parking gauze, or more often as needed. 23 Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare rapidly progressive infectious complication of C-section, characterized by extensive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and other adjacent surrounding soft tissue. Most cases of necrotizing fasciitis are secondary to mixed synergistic infection with coliforms, streptococci, and anaerobes (including bacteroides species and clostridia species). Occasionally, group A Streptococcus can be the cause of puerperal necrotizing fasciitis and be introduced externally from the skin or throat, or endogenously from the vagina or anal carriage. Post-C-section necrotizing fasciitis is associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity malnutrition, intravenous drug abuse, and hypertension. 23 A retrospective review of 23 women admitted to an obstetric and gynecology service with necrotizing fasciitis in a single hospital over 14 years was recently reported. 24 Six women (26%) were puerperal complications, three of whom were associated with C-section and three from episiotomy infections. As noted in this report and other series, necrotizing fasciitis, whether in the abdomen or vulvar area, are usually polymicrobial. [24] [25] [26] [27] Obesity was a major predisposition, occurring in 86.9% of the entire cohort of 23 women. Severe pain on presentation was a common manifestation in 83.3% of puerperal complications and 70.6% of the non-puerperal patients. Common findings on physical examination include marked degree of subcutaneous edema with varying degrees of skin discoloration, rare presence of overlying anesthesia (one patient), and presence of subcutaneous gas by radiography in eight (34.8%) patients. 24 The recognition and early diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis post-C-section or delivery is critical because delay in a few hours in intervention can be fatal. 23 A characteristic feature of most cases that leads to delay in diagnosis is the benign-appearing wound and skin, but patients were systemically toxic or ill looking, often with persistent fever, marked leucocytosis and spreading inflammation of the surrounding tissues. Although radiographic studies, 28,29 ultrasonography, CT scan, 30 or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 31 have been used to assist in differentiating cellulitis or ordinary wound infection from necrotizing fasciitis, or bedside biopsy for frozen section, 32 there has been no prospective evaluation to assess differential merits and effect on outcome. In a small case control study of 21 necrotizing fasciitis and paired match controls, multivariate analysis found that a white blood count >14 \u00c2 10 9 /L, serum sodium <135 mmol/L, and blood uren nitrogen >15 mg/dL separated those with necrotizing fasciitis from those with non-necrotizing infection. 28 This study needs to be repeated in prospective larger trials and include other investigations, such as creatine phosphokinase, venous lactate, and easily obtainable portable imaging (ultrasonography).",

The need for immediate aggressive surgery for necrotizing fasciitis has been recognized since the 1950s 33 and reinforced by more recent guidelines. 34 Initial observation showed that the average time from onset of disease to diagnosis and treatment was 4 days for those who lived, and 7 days for those who died. 35 Other subsequent studies found 48 h duration was a more significant time frame, after which the mortality rate was 75%. 27 The critical time for radical surgery after admission to hospital for manifestations of necrotizing fasciitis appears to less than 12 h, as significant morbidity exists if surgery is delayed for >12 h. 36 ",

Although the evidence was inconclusive for low-risk patients undergoing C-section, use of antibiotic prophylaxis was also recommended (level C evidence). In a Cochrane review of the topic, 39 81 studies were analyzed for elective C-section (N \u00bc 2,037) and non-elective C-section (N \u00bc 2,132) . There was a finding of reduction of endometritis by two-thirds to three quarters, and a significant reduction of wound infections (36% for non-elective and 73% for elective Csection). 39 The policy of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for all C-section was also supported by other reviews. 40, 41 Thus, a single dose of safe, inexpensive antibiotic is very affective in preventing endometritis and surgical wound infection after Csection. It is most likely that in case 2, the infection ascended from the vagina to the uterine cavity (with endometritis), then spreading to the wound and surrounding tissue causing necrotizing fasciitis. Thus, if prophylactic antibiotics were given, it is more likely than not that the serious puerperal infection would have been prevented. It should be noted that the patient under discussion fulfilled the criteria for high-risk C-section, which is associated with post-operative infectious complications of 70-90% without antibiotic prophylaxis.",

The nasopharynx is the commonest site of carriage, and aerosolized nasopharyngeal secretions are the primary means by which group A streptococci (GAS) are spread among humans. 42 The carriage rates of GAS vary with geographic location, season of the year, and age. In children, the rates of pharyngeal colonization vary from 10% to 20%, being most common in Winter and Spring. 43 In adults the carriage rates are much lower. Skin carriage is usually infrequent except for patients who have skin diseases, such as eczema, psoriasis, and wounds or pyoderma. 44 Thus, direct contact with contaminated skin or mucus membranes is of secondary importance, and contact with contaminated surfaces or fomites or via insects are potential sources, but of minor importance. 42 Food-borne outbreaks of GAS pharyngitis from salads, eggs and cheese prepared by infected or colonized food handlers have been reported. 44 Occasionally mini-outbreaks of GAS wound infections in hospitalized patients have been associated with vaginal or ano-rectal colonization in health care personnel. 43, 45, 46 Pharyngitis, or sore throat, is a common condition in adults and even more frequent in children. It was estimated that 18 million patients sought care for sore throats in the United States in 1996, making it the sixth leading cause of visits to physicians. 47 Moreover, four to six times more individuals may have, but not seek care for their sore throats. The majority of acute pharyngitis (about two-thirds) are caused by common respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, etc.), and only about 5-10% in adults and 15-30% in children are caused by GAS. 44, 48, 49 Other bacteria causing pharyngitis include group G and C \u00df-hemolytic streptococci, diphtheria, Arcanobacteria hemolyticum, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. 44 However, GAS is the most important bacterial cause of sore throat and probably Fusobacterium necrophorum (which probably can cause Lemierre syndrome) in adolescents and young adults. 50 The spectrum of disease of GAS pharyngitis varies from mild sore throat with resolution of symptoms in 3-5 days, to severe tonsillitis with fever and lymphadenitis. Complications such as peritonsillar abscess, scarlet fever, bacteremia with toxic shock syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and rheumatic fever are uncommon complications, and rheumatic fever is now a rare complication in developed countries. The clinical diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is considered inaccurate without a throat culture; the ability to predict presence of GAS by physicians is limited, with estimated sensitivity of 55-74% and specificity of 58-76%. 44 The Centor criteria proposed to improve the clinical diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis (moderate to severe cases attending an ER) include tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, absence of cough, and history of fever. 51 However, if three or four Centor criteria are met, the positive predictive value is still only 40-60%, and in the absence of these criteria, the negative predictive value is only 80%. 44 Because of the low predictive values of clinical criteria, expert panels recommend throat culture and treatment only of confirmed cases of GAS pharyngitis. [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] For patients with typical viral syndromes such as rhinorrhea, cough, myalgias, and sore throat (with or without fever), a throat swab is usually not necessary. Cost-effective analysis of the diagnosis and management of pharyngitis in adults have found that throat culture is the least expensive and most effective strategy when the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis is less than 20%. 57 ",

Guidelines for prevention of surgical site infection noted increased risk of wound infection with any coexistent infections at a remote site, 61 but did not specifically address the issue of pharyngitis. In a previous study of 2,349 patients with clean surgical wounds, wound infection rate in 208 patients with documented remote infections was 14.8% compared with 6.9% in the 2,141 patients without remote infections (p > 0.001). 62 However, in this study pharyngitis was not listed as one of the remote infections.",

As stated by editorial views, this decision is left to the physician's best clinical judgment about an individual patient undergoing a specific procedure for a specific duration of time. 63 It is evident the surgical team should weigh the risks versus the benefits of proceeding with surgery. Obviously, this would apply mainly to elective procedures rather than urgent or semi-urgent conditions. Good judgment, common sense, and proper informed consent with adequate discussion involving the patient and family should take precedence in making the decision to proceed with a specific case.

Based on limited experience, the authors conclude that remote site infection should be treated for at least 24 h before surgery. 62 It may be prudent to automatically delay elective procedures for some conditions in patients with remote site infections.

Members of the jury and judges will often be sympathetic to pregnant women who suffer from an adverse event (human nature) and there may be a tendency to rule in their favor. Moreover, the effects of these adverse outcomes may affect not only the mother but also the offspring. The way to limit being sued for medical malpractice when managing or attending pregnant women involves the same principles of good medical practice that should always be followed. Pay attention to detail, (history, examination, and test results), keep an open mind, always look for the worst complication, but do not overlook simple \"minor issues\" which may become major issues, and always attend and treat promptly. Whenever there is a potential for a catastrophic outcome, (despite the rarity of that event) have a high index of suspicion and do not hesitate to refer or transfer patients quickly to an acute care hospital or tertiary care center, or request a consultation with a specialist. Too often however, basic principles of treatment are neglected until it is too late -such as not opening and exploring a local infected wound. To a certain extent, we as physicians are too over dependent on modern technology (CT, MRI) and specialist opinion before implementing the basic tenets of proven therapy, which have been established for more than a century.",
