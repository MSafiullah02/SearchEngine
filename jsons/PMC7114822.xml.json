Thereafter, PDCoV was detected in the United States and isolated from pigs suffering from severe diarrhea in 2014 by Hu et al. in Ohio, USA (Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014b). Pathogenesis and virulence were subsequently investigated using gnotobiotic and conventionally raised pigs. PDCoV infection is characterized by watery diarrhea and vomiting 1\u20133 days after infection (Hu et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2015); it has since been detected in swine populations throughout the world, resulting in substantial economic losses (Lee and Lee, 2014; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014a).",

The 5\u2019ORF1a/b comprises two-thirds of the genome and encodes two overlapping viral replicase polyproteins (1a and 1ab), The six following ORFs encode four structural proteins and two strain-specific accessory proteins in the order: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7) (Lee and Lee, 2015).",

The S1 subunit mediates virus binding to cells through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. In addition, the S protein is postulated to harbor epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies (Raj et al., 2013; Zumla et al., 2016). Hain et al. (Hain et al., 2016) generated a recombinant Orf virus (ORFV) that expresses the full-length PEDV S protein. An immunization challenge study in pigs showed that intramuscular inoculation with ORFV-PEDV-S elicited S-specific IgG, IgA, and a neutralizing antibody response. Inoculation with PDCoV S protein may therefore be able to inhibit PDCoV infection and induce neutralizing antibodiess against PDCoV infection.",

The RBD regions in several CoV genera have been identified. For example, the C-terminus of the S1 domain is the RBD region of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the genus Alphacoronavirus (Godet et al., 1994) and in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genus Betacoronavirus (Li et al., 2005). In contrast, the RBD regions of murine hepatitis virus and bovine coronavirus, both in the genus Betacoronavirus, are located in the N-terminus of the S1 domain (Peng et al., 2011, 2012). However, the immunodominant neutralizing region associated with delta-CoVs, such as PDCoV, has not been identified.",

            "text": "Recent elucidation of PDCoV spike protein structures by cryo-electron microscopy reveal that the S1 subunit consists of four individually folded domains, designated A, B, C, and D (Xiong et al., 2018). Recently, Li et al. (Li et al., 2018) demonstrated that the porcine aminopeptidase N, previously known to be a functional receptor for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), also interacts with the B domain of PDCoV S1 subunit and functions as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the immunodominant region of PDCoV S protein, and its neutralizing epitopes. Based on previous structural data and the location of the RBD region in the S protein of PDCoV (Li et al., 2018), three truncated S proteins spanning the entire S domain were produced using an E.coli expression system. The constructs were designated NTD (N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, amino acids (aa) 50-286), CTD (C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (aa 278-616), and the S2 subunit (aa 601-1087). We purified the recombinant proteins and inoculated rabbits and mice to produce NTD-, CTD-, and S2-specific polyclonal antisera. Sera from NTD-, CTD-, and S2-inoculated mice had PDCoV neutralization activity after the second boost. All antisera, from mice and rabbits, exhibited anti-PDCoV activity in vitro, determined by virus neutralization, fluorescent focus neutralization, and plaque-reduction neutralization assays. Among the three antisera, the CTD-specific sera showed the most potent PDCoV inhibitory effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) of the PDCoV S protein.",

Sera were collected every week after the primary inoculation and PDCoV-specific antibodies were detected using ELISA. The results showed that each protein induced PDCoV-IgG antibodies after the first inoculation, and all mice showed a significantly enhanced immune response three weeks after the secondary boost. CTD induced the highest level of IgG antibody (Fig. 4B). The PDCoV neutralizing-activity of the mouse sera was assessed using a virus neutralization (VN) assay. PDCoV neutralization was detected 2 weeks after mice were initially inoculated and the neutralizing titers increased significantly thereafter (Fig. 4C). Sera from the PBS inoculated control group had no significant neutralizing activity. After 4 weeks, each sera effectively neutralized PDCoV infection in vitro; antibody titers were 1:218 \u00b1 38, 1:545 \u00b1 81, and 1: 291 \u00b1 68, respectively (Fig. 4C). More importantly, neutralizing antibody titers induced by CTD were significantly higher than those induced by NTD or S2 at weeks 4 and 6 (Fig. 4C), indicating that CTD contains the main neutralizing epitope in the PDCoV S protein.",

Given its critical functions in cellular entry, S protein is a high-priority target for vaccine development. S protein-specific serum or secretory neutralizing antibodies may play a key role in protection against coronavirus infection (Okda et al., 2017; Song et al., 2016). Several neutralizing epitopes have been identified in the full-length PEDV S protein, with the majority of epitope(s) mapping to a collagenase equivalent domain (COE) (Okda et al., 2017). Vaccine development has therefore been focused exclusively on the COE epitope. An oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393), a recombinant Lactobacillus casei that expresses DC-targeting peptide fused with a COE protein, was developed by Hou et al. (Hou et al., 2018).",

However, since the neutralizing antibody in these experiments was obtained from a single time point after immunization, the result is not conclusive. To verify the relative efficacies of the antisera, female BALB/c mice were inoculated with purified protein and the corresponding antibodies was evaluated several times after immunization. The inoculated mice showed a significant increase in anti-PDCoV antibody titer after receiving the second immunization (Fig. 4B).

At week 4, mice inoculated with CTD showed a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titers to 1:545 (\u00b1 81.7).

Previous work demonstrated that an anti-PEDV-S2 mAb recognizing the linear epitope GPRLQPY at the carboxy-terminal of the S2 subunit exhibited neutralizing activity against PEDV (Cruz et al., 2008). Similarly, a neutralizing mAb that specifically recognizes the S1-NTD of MERS-CoV S protein has been identified (Chen et al., 2017). In our study, we also found that regions S2 and S1-NTD can induce neutralizing antibody, consistent with previous reports (Chen et al., 2017; Cruz et al., 2008). In addition, all CoVs use the S1-CTD or S1-NTD regions to interact with cellular receptors or co-receptors for viral attachment. The main functional RBD regions of most \u03b1-CoVs and some \u03b2-CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1, are located in the S1-CTD (Chen et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2016). In contrast, the RBDs of human CoV OC43, MHV, and avian \u03b3-CoV are located in the S1-NTD region. Importantly, the S-RBD region in most CoVs contains critical neutralizing sites that induce potent neutralizing antibodies (Du et al., 2013a; He et al., 2004b; Yoo and Deregt, 2001). Using ten anti-PEDV-S1 mAbs, Li et al.(Li et al., 2017a) showed that six non-overlapping neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes exist in the S1 subunit of the PEDV spike protein, and that most of the neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain. The antibodies induced by NTD, CTD, and S2 in our study differed in neutralization capacity against PDCoV in vitro (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The superior inhibitory and neutralizing capacity of CTD antiserum suggests that this region may contain the main RBD region or neutralizing epitopes in the PDCoV S protein.",

            "text": "Recently, three research groups demonstrated that pAPN is a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV, and its catalytic domain can interact with S1-CTD (Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). In these studies, APN-knockout IPI-2I cells and ST cells were still susceptible to PDCoV infection. By analyzing the three-dimensional structures of PDCoV S1-CTD, TGEV S1-CTD, and pAPN, Zhu et al. (Zhu et al., 2018) found that the shorter \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turns in PDCoV S1-CTD may cause insufficient contact with pAPN compared with TGEV S1-CTD. These data indicate that pAPN may be a major entry receptor for PDCOV, but other unknown PDCOV receptors also exist. Li et al. (Li et al., 2017b) found that MERS-CoV uses both protein and sialoglycan-based receptor determinants, with binding to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) required for entry and cell surface sialic acids (Sias) serving as attachment factors, respectively. Data also show that DPP4 interacts with the CTD region of MERS-CoV S1 subunit (Mou et al., 2013), and the Sia binding site lies within S1-NTD of the MERS-CoV (Li et al., 2017b). In our current study, we showed that the NTD of PDCoV S1 subunit can induce neutralizing antibody responses. Importantly, the sugar-binding capability of PDCoV S1-NTD to mucin has been demonstrated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Shang et al., 2017). Therefore, we speculate that one sugar receptor may interact with the NTD region in the S1 Subunit and influence the entry of PDCoV into the cell, just as Sia is used as an additional receptor for MERS-CoV cell entry.",

We found that three regions in PDCOV S protein, including NTD (aa 50-286), CTD (aa 278-616), and S2 (aa 601-1087), can induce neutralizing antibody responses, and the specific polyclonal mouse and rabbit sera efficiently inhibit PDCoV entry and infection in ST cells. Because receptor binding domains on CoVs are often targets for potent neutralizing antibodies, we speculate that the CTD and NTD regions may bind to protein and sugar receptors, respectively. Our results provide a foundation for the study of PDCoV receptors and their receptor binding domains. CTD may be more immunogenic than the NTD and S2 regions and may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein. Therefore, CTD potentially offers an attractive target for the development of vaccines to prevent PDCoV infection and combat future PDCoV- disease pandemics.",
