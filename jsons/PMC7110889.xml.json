During past influenza seasons, many severe cases and deaths were reported among the middle-aged population group, which had a major socioeconomic impact. Therefore, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) expanded their scope to provide free influenza vaccinations for children aged 6 months to <18 years, pregnant women, women within 6 months of giving birth, adults aged >50 years, at-risk individuals with chronic medical conditions, individuals with rare diseases or major illnesses/injury, health care and public health personnel, poultry farmers and animal health inspectors, individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of \u226530 kg/m2, and residents and personnel at nursing institutes. This campaign increased the flu vaccination coverage from 13% to 25% of the total population of Taiwan.",

The ability to detect viruses has improved with the availability of PCR, and several new viruses have been identified (Poutanen et al., 2003, van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Zaki et al., 2012). The use of more sensitive methods has led to an increased rate of diagnosis for viral infections and to improvements in patient outcomes. With an automated multiplex PCR device, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, 17 viral pathogens and 3 bacterial pathogens can be detected in a closed system that requires only 3 min of hands-on time and approximately 1 h of instrumentation time.",

Antigenic characterization of these 3C.2a viruses continues to be technically challenging due to their low or undetectable hemagglutination activity, as described in many studies (Lednicky et al., 2016, Lin et al., 2017, Skowronski et al., 2016). In Taiwan, these viruses were first detected in early 2016. In addition, two influenza A H3N2 isolates were identified with two additional substitutions I58V and S219Y forming clade 3C.2a and belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2 cluster I; this new subclade emerged and was proposed in London recently (Harvala et al., 2017).",

Influenza surveillance in Taiwan is based on sentinel physician and laboratory isolation of influenza viruses (Lin et al., 2008). However, other respiratory viruses cause upper respiratory tract infections at rates similar to those of influenza A virus and account for a substantial percentage of all ILI cases (Fowlkes et al., 2014, Otomaru et al., 2015). Data from this study showed that around 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were not caused by influenza virus infections. Even during the influenza season there are still many other respiratory pathogens, not only viruses but also bacteria, that co-circulate with influenza virus. Of note, HRV/HEV most part of the non-influenza infections in Taiwan, and data from further laboratory investigations showed that 11 (84.6%) of these cases were caused by enteroviruses CA2, CA6, and CA10. The rate of positivity for HRV/HEV infection in the present study is higher than that reported in previous studies (Liao et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2004).",

In this study, the concurrent existence of European strains in the 3C.2a2 subclade was identified (Harvala et al., 2017), and this genetic observation showed that epidemic strains of the same serotype isolated in Taiwan were comparable to strains isolated elsewhere; however, the origin and effects of strains introduced from outside Taiwan could not be addressed in this study. It remains unclear why Taiwan is an important region for viral diversity. However, the geographical position of Taiwan provides an ideal environment for viral migration between tropical and temperate regions. Furthermore, among the countries of East Asia, Taiwan is particularly highly interconnected with the world via air travel. Thus the continuous monitoring of Taiwanese isolates may provide a complete profile of viral antigenic and genetic evolution patterns that may be important to assist in the early prediction of potential new regional or pandemic strains.",

The total runtime is approximately 6.5 h and the cost of testing eight specimens for all 20 respiratory pathogens is about USD 623.80, including reagents and supplies. Assuming the use of a single FilmArray instrument for diagnosis, it takes about 8.5 h to test eight specimens. The list price for eight FilmArray Respiratory Panel kits is USD 1032.00 (USD 129.00/test), and no other reagents or supplies are needed. Thus, the cost of the FilmArray assay is higher than that of the previously used conventional methods for respiratory pathogen testing. However, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel offers significant advantages such as accuracy, ease of use, faster turnaround time, and less hands-on time, and this test may be more favorable than other available methods.",

Previous studies have shown the rapid evolution of Taiwanese influenza isolates in terms of antigenic and genetic diversity, which may result in epidemic strains that have the capacity to become the dominant strains worldwide (Chiu et al., 2014, Lin et al., 2011, Lin et al., 2007). Of note, the data from this study show that the FilmArray system was able to detect new genetic variants of the influenza A H3N2 virus even in the small number of samples tested.
