To relax the preventive measures, countries must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence.",

However, the virus is still here: its transmission has been slowed but not eliminated. And as yet, there is neither an effective cure nor a vaccine available.",

            "text": "A period of 100 days (over 3 months) is a considerable time, which has already exerted massive impacts on economies, socio-cultural patterns, health (physical, emotional, and psychological), and political landscapes. These multidimensional effects are visible at local, national, and global levels. Social life is entirely disturbed: people are nearing their breaking points, standing on the verge of violating the constant isolation and quarantine. Health-care systems, even in high-income countries, are overwhelmed, and the physical, emotional, and psychological health of people has been noticeably affected. Political structures at national as well as international levels are under substantial pressure. Globally, governments are making their best possible efforts for simultaneous interruption of the virus' spread and mitigating its impacts on their countries, including their economies. Yet massive economic damage has already been done, as millions of people are out of work, and stock markets have plummeted. Despite enough investments to implement stringent measures to ameliorate the foreseeable economic impact, the pandemic has already produced short-term impacts and also exert long-term effects. 4 When the situation is already overwhelming, then how substantial are the impacts that COVID-19 can exert, if a second wave of the virus occurs? Although the future is uncertain, unknown, and hard to predict, there are enough examples from history to comprehend the scale of impacts of a viral pandemic. For example, the Spanish flu, which began in 1918, provides a highly relevant analogy due to its nature and scale and to the fact that both infections lead to pneumonia and involve respiratory diseases. The Spanish flu pandemic resulted in the deaths of approximately 50 million people, far more than COVID-19 is causing. It is vital to understand that the Spanish flu pandemic was not quickly eradicated, as we seem to expect COVID-19 to be. Rather, it lasted for 2 y, spreading in successive waves of infection around the world. 5 It is possible that the coronavirus will do the same, a danger I seek to highlight in this article because our governments and media continuously insist that, at least in the first group of countries that have already seemingly passed the peak, all will soon be well. What if it would not? Are we prepared for that?",

            "text": "Another issue I wish to raise here is the fact that COVID-19 has already generated numerous rumors and conspiracy theories that circulate at local, national, and global levels and are often reproduced by government leaders. 6 The World Health Organization (WHO) terms this flow of (mis) information as \"infodemics,\" stating, \"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic.\" 7 This (dis)information is spreading parallel to the escalation of COVID-19, due to social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, all platforms that amplify the circulation of (dis)information. 8, 9 The emergence of rumors and conspiracy theories is a universal and historical phenomenon (I. Ali, unpublished data, 2020). 10 In the face of \"uncertainties,\" probable \"dangers,\" and \"chaos,\" people construct stories to make sense of these situations. Such narratives tend to exert mostly negative impacts on how individuals deal with the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to be able to deal effectively with the adverse effects of such narratives on public health preparedness. For instance, there are rumors that this is a \"normal\" flu, as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan asked their citizens to continue working after calling the virus and its treatment \"bogus\" (I. Ali, unpublished data, 2020). 9 These rumors would exert adverse impacts in the form of people's negligence and easiness about the virus. Their lack of attention to the virus would hinder the processes of containment. The virus may remain asymptomatic in many cases without developing any severe consequences, but these asymptomatic people can transfer the virus to other people, who may be among the \"at-risk\" groups, such as older people. 11 This way, the virus would continue spreading, causing more burden on the health-care systems, and influencing the preparedness, not at a country level, but at the global level, because the world is highly interconnected.",
