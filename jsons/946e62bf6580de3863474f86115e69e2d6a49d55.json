They are found in mammals, invertebrates, and plants. In general, they are small, amphipathic molecules, contain positive charge, and can be structurally divided into several categories. The mode of action goes beyond their antimicrobial capacities, and they elicit a complex array of responses in different cell types. The most extensively studied mammalian gene families are the cathelicidins and DEFENSINS. In general the ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES disrupt lipid membranes and thereby induce microbial killing. Micro-organisms have developed several countermeasures against ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES, but the many structurally different peptide classes still provide protection against infection (Table 10.1) .

After ingestion, the particle is surrounded by the membrane of the phagocyte, forming a vacuole known as a PHAGOSOME.

When a second encounter occurs, T cells produce lymphokines, which activate the MACROPHAGES. These activated MACROPHAGES grow larger, produce more and better degrading enzymes, and are now able to eliminate micro-organisms, which otherwise would have survived intracellularly (tuberculosis, typhoid fever). MACROPHAGES from non-immune animals are not able to eliminate these micro-organisms. Five different classes of ANTIBODIES can be distinguished in man, namely, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. They differ from one another in size, charge, amino acid composition, and glycosylation (see Chap. 4). In principle, the structure of the ANTIBODIES is the same, i.e. two heavy and two light chains: it is the variable part of these chains that recognises the micro-organism. The biological function (see below) is determined by the constant part (Fc) of the heavy chain. With the exception of IgD, all these ANTIBODIES are important in antimicrobial activity.",

This bond is very strong (i.e. has a high AFFINITY) and is difficult to break by the administration of ANTIBODIES. In practice, if there are clinical symptoms of the disease, then large doses of antitoxins must be administered.

This family of TLR proteins ( Fig. 10.4) , which resemble the antimicrobial Toll proteins of Drosophila (fruit fly), has been identified in humans and mice. TLR4 was identified as the missing link in LPSinduced cell signal transduction and responsiveness that is associated with MD-2 and CD14. It is known that C3H/HeJ mice are hyporesponsive to the biological effects of LPS. This proved to be the result of TLR4 deficiency. The TLR family members are coupled to a signalling adapter protein (MyD88) and form differential dimers that may explain the discrete responses to TLR ligands such as lipoproteins, heat SHOCK proteins, unmethylated CpG DNA, viral dsRNA, and bacterial flagellin. Intracellular signalling involves several kinases depending on the TLR involved and includes the MAP kinase and NF-\u03baB pathways leading to a cellular response. PAMP for TLR2 include a variety of agonists derived from Gram-positive organisms such as PEPTIDOGLYCAN and lipoteichoic acid. Therefore, it seems that TLR2 and TLR4 are activated primarily by different PAMP to initiate the host response to Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial infection, respectively. This is Several lines of evidence support the current hypothesis that the monocyte/macrophage is the principal cellular mediator of endotoxicity. LPShyporesponsive TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice are made responsive by transfer of MACROPHAGES of a closely related LPSsensitive strain. When the host is challenged with LPS, soluble factors are produced by MACROPHAGES that mediate fever and an acute-phase response. These factors include the pro-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Together, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 stimulate endothelial cells to produce and express proteins on their membrane that have adhesive properties for LEUKOCYTES, promoting the margination and passage of neutrophils from blood vessels through the endothelial layer, leading to neutrophil influx into the tissue. ADHESION MOLECULEs that mediate the binding of neutrophils appear on the endothelium after an inflammatory stimulus, followed by molecules that are specific for adhesion of MONOCYTES or LYMPHOCYTES, which may be why NEUTROPHILS enter before mononuclear cells. Molecules that are currently known to be involved in leukocyte-endothelium interactions belong to three structural groups: the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, the integrin family, and the selectin family.",

            "text": "The HIV is a retrovirus that infects cells bearing the CD4 antigen, such as T helper cells (Th), MACROPHAGES, and DENDRITIC CELLS. The CD4 molecule, together with other RECEPTOR molecules, like chemokine RECEPTOR CCR5, acts as a binding site for the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of the virus. In an attempt to respond to HIV ANTIGENS and concomitant secondary microbial infections, these cells are activated, thus inducing the replication of HIV in the infected CD4 T cells, which are finally destroyed. In contrast, HIV-1 infection of MACROPHAGES is self-sustained and results in an inexorable growth of chronic active inflammatory processes in many tissue compartments including the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. Infected cells bear the fusion protein gp41 and may therefore fuse with other infected cells. This helps the virus to spread and accounts for the multinucleated cells seen in lymph nodes and brain. As a result of the decreased numbers of CD4 + Th cells and defects in antigen presentation, depressed immune responses in these patients are observed. During the progression of the disease, OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS by otherwise harmless micro-organisms can occur. These include Candida albicans oesophagitis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, toxoplasma in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, and pneumonia caused by toxoplasma and Pneumocystis carinii; Kaposi's sarcoma also occurs frequently in these patients. This has been linked to the presence of a previously unknown type of herpes virus . This immune deficiency syndrome is called 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS). It has been suggested that infected MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES carry the HIV virus into the brain where it replicates in microglia and infiltrating MACROPHAGES. As a consequence, many AIDS patients develop cognitive and motor brain impairments. However, the picture is complicated by the various persistent infections already present in these patients, which give rise to their own pathology in the brain. These include Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, and JC virus.",

            "text": "So far, no cure for HIV INFECTION has been achieved. The main effort in the prevention of HIV INFECTION lies in mass public education programmes. Treatment of infected individuals is possible but expensive. HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) reduces morbidity and mortality among patients infected with HIV (see Fig. 10 .5). Success is limited by the emergence of drug-resistance viruses that can be transmitted to newly infected individuals. Resistance, drug toxicity, and poor patient ADHERENCE lead to treatment failure and necessitate continuous development of alternative treatment strategies that intervene with the HIV replication cycle: i.e. on the level of virus entry, critical viral enzymes [reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and proteases (PR)], or viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein. At this moment a triple therapy is being prescribed in Western countries (two RT inhibitors and one PR inhibitor, Fig. 10.4) , each of which interfere with specific steps in the process of HIV replication. One major problem that has arisen is the increasing resistance to these drugs. Agents with novel MECHANISMS OF ACTION provide options for patients with DRUG-RESISTANT virus. Blocking of the chemokine RECEPTOR CCR5, a co-RECEPTOR on CD4 cells for HIV, is an alternative treatment for persons infected with the R5 HIV type. This notion is supported by a recent finding that a homozygous defect in this chemokine RECEPTOR accounts for resistance of multiple-exposed individuals to HIV-1 infection. Currently a commercially available drug is being used that specifically binds to CCR5 on the surface of the CD4 cell and selectively blocks HIV-1 binding. One remarkable HIV patient, known as the 'Berlin patient' and on an antiretroviral therapy for 10 years, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and therefore received a haematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the 'resistant' CCR5 receptor. He had to stop his antiretroviral medication, and after 3 months, the virus was undetectable, and his CD4 counts recovered. He is now considered cured from HIV.",

While Pasteur remained faithful to the principle of attenuated micro-organisms in preparing his vaccines, Koch employed killed germs (cholera) as a vaccine. Since diphtheria and tetanus cause disease by means of toxins, the next logical step in the development of vaccines was the use of detoxified toxins to induce protection against these diseases [diphtheria (Von Behring) and tetanus (Kitasato)]. Von Behring and Kitasato were the first to demonstrate that the source of the protective activity induced by vaccines was present in blood serum. Von Behring was also the first to prove that protective immunity could be passed on via serum. The development of new vaccines had its ups (yellow fever) and downs (tuberculosis). With the arrival of antibiotics, all work on new bacterial vaccines was suspended or severely curtailed, although some researchers continued to work on viral vaccines, such as rubella, measles, polio, and mumps.",

            "text": "Since it has proved difficult to consistently develop new antibiotics to combat antibioticresistant bacteria, interest in vaccines has gradually increased over the last 15 years (see Chap. C1). Today, thanks to new insights into the IMMUNE SYSTEM and modern molecular biological and chemical techniques of analysis and synthesis, it is possible to produce well-defined vaccines. These contain only those determinants of the PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISM that induce protection (EPITOPES). These EPITOPES are usually short peptide or oligosaccharide chains, which can be produced synthetically or by means of RECOMBINANT DNA techniques. The immunogenicity of these products can be enhanced by coupling them to a CARRIER (tetanus toxoid, liposomes) and/or by adding an adjuvant (a substance that strengthens the immune response non-specifically). The RECOMBINANT DNA technique can also be used to obtain attenuated strains of micro-organisms, which are fully immunogenic and thus provide protection but which are no longer virulent. One example of this is the development of a new cholera vaccine based on a bacterium that has all the characteristics of a virulent strain, except the toxin. The bacterium has retained all its ADHERENCE factors, which allow it to adhere to the intestinal mucosa; the length of time it spends in the intestine is sufficient to stimulate the local IMMUNE SYSTEM. The newest trend in vaccinology is immunisation by introducing plasmid DNA into the host. Success has been attained by this method for hepatitis B vaccination. An example that holds a combination of modern techniques has been developed to combat Malaria, a communicable disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite that is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. P. falciparum causes the highest rates of complications and mortality and is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, especially young children. Besides many alternative strategies to combat the spread of malaria, vaccination is a long-going approach. A promising candidate vaccine combines the circumsporozoite coat protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen exposed on the surface of selfassembled virus-like particles together with immunomodulatory adjuvants. It has been shown to induce an immunogenicity profile in controlled human malaria infection model and field studies in sub-Saharan Africa. Not only are new vaccines being developed, but it is also possible to heighten NATURAL resistance for longer or shorter periods. Various INTERLEUKINS (IL-2, GM-CSF) and INTERFERONS are being studied in order to use them to combat infectious diseases (see Chap. C7). Passive ANTIBODY therapy with polyclonal or MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (mouse or human IgG with single SPECIFICITY) for infectious diseases is experiencing a renewed interest. Targeting soluble factors (like neutralisation of bacterial toxins and viruses) or common structures (like bacterial adhesins or viral entry factors) in high-risk patient groups may be beneficial alone or may enhance the therapeutic EFFICACY of other drugs. Targets for clinical development of MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES include multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci, Bacillus anthracis toxin, HIV, HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Therapeutic application of human monoclonal antibodies is boosted by their proven success for various cancers. Molecular cloning and efficient in vitro production by cell lines enable customising antibody properties like IgG subclass, glycosylation pattern (to chance effector functions like complement activation, receptor triggering, or half-life), or coupling with toxins, antibiotics, and inhibitors. Renewed optimism for treatment of HIV is encouraged by uncovered naturally arising, broad, and potent HIV-1neutralising antibodies. It is a challenge to select the best monoclonal antibody (or cocktail) that not only depends on its capacity to recognise HIV broadly, but may also relate to the kinetics of the antibody epitope expression on infected cells. Understanding the molecular complexity of the neutralising antibody repertoire towards the main antigenic determinant of the influenza virus, the HA surface glycoprotein, is important to design a future vaccine that can elicit long-term broadly protective antibodies to a variety of different strains. Combining new adjuvants with current H1N1 vaccine improved antibody affinity maturation and offers the promise of improved protection in vivo, particularly in na\u00efve individuals.",

This developing platform has been revolutionising our ability to modify and manipulate genomes, which profoundly changes biological research and therapeutics development.

Herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus, and HIV are known for their persistence or latency state where they are unrecognisable for the immune system. Therefore the DNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas system could be a powerful tool to tackle persistent viral infections.

            "text": "As outlined above for a number of bacteria and viruses, effective vaccines have been developed and applied worldwide. The eradication of smallpox (Variola major) virus in the 1970s was a milestone for the World Health Organisation. The next goal of the WHO is to eradicate poliovirus in the coming years. Major problems to be dealt with are the distribution of these vaccines, the costs involved, the registration and the compliance of the vaccines, and molecular techniques to trace the final bug. Meanwhile new unexpected microbiological threats become in focus. Hospital infections caused by multiresistant microorganism due to the abundance use of antibiotics and exchange of genetic material between microorganisms impose major problems on patients and healthcare workers. New antibiotics and/or vaccines should be developed and new strategies employed to contain these infections. Due to crowding and the high mobility of the world population, old and new pathogens, e.g. influenza and SARS, threaten our society. The recent influenza A H1N1 ('Mexican') flu outbreak in 2009 demonstrated how rapidly a new strain of flu can emerge and spread around the world. The sudden outbreak of this novel flu virus has tested the world's public health preparedness. In the Netherlands, Q fever emerged with large epi-demic outbreaks. Q fever is a zoonotic disease that is passed from infected (farm) animals (cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary carriers) to humans. Q fever is a disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and faeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. C. burnetii is resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, allowing it to survive for a long time in the environment. People can become infected by inhalation of the bacteria, but the risk of infection is low. Only about one-half of all people infected with C. burnetii show signs of clinical illness (e.g. flu-like illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis). Q fever can be treated with antibiotics, and most people will recover fully. As a control measurement, pregnant goats on dairy farms had to be killed, and a mandatory vaccination campaign was started. Since May 2015, Zika virus infection spread from Brazil to other countries in South and Middle America as well the Western Hemisphere. Although most infections are unnoticed or only follow mild symptoms like fever and rash, in pregnant women, the infection may cause microcephaly. This is a birth defect where a baby's head is smaller than expected and the brain is not developed properly. Zika virus was recently (1947) identified in a rhesus monkey and is spread by the bite of an infected yellow fever or dengue mosquito which are not endemic in the Netherlands. Currently no vaccine or specific medication is available, but new vaccine candidates elicit neutralising antibodies in mice and non-human primates providing protection against Zika virus infection. Since March 2014, the largest outbreak of Ebola virus in history has affected multiple countries in West Africa, especially Guinea and Sierra Leone. Ebola virus causes a grotesque haemorrhagic fever syndrome that is associated with high mortality in humans. The virus originates from an infected animal (like bats) and may jump to a person where it is easily transmitted by direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids. Infected people were placed in quarantine, but the lack of treatment capacity and isolation facilities hampered an efficient response. The infection caused major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region. The international community responded with funds, specialists, equipment, and training. Two years later the outbreak has been brought under control, and only an occasional flare-up occurred. The frightening reputation of the disease has reemerged the efforts to produce a vaccine. A recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based candidate vaccine, expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire ebolavirus, proved to be protective in animals including non-human primates. Although this vaccine candidate was not yet officially approved, an emergency stockpile was produced. A field 'ring vaccination' (after the outbreak) trial proved to be effective in localised infections. This encouraged new opportunities to develop robust and safe new vaccine strategies to combat Ebola virus outbreaks. High-throughput sequencing and epitope mapping, high-resolution proteomics, and single-cell antibody-cloning techniques combined with computational methods are applied to map both natural and elicited epitope targets of antibodies in a given individual. This guides both structural vaccinology approaches and development of protective immunisation with specific human monoclonal antibodies. Besides developments in vaccinology, highthroughput sequencing (also known as nextgeneration sequencing) methods and computational analysis are becoming widely used to study complex bacterial (and viral) communities in various niches. It is estimated that 90% of cells in the human body are of microbial origin. This commensal relationship is well established, but the vast majority of the taxa present in the microbiome are unknown. Analysis of the various microbiome populations in the human body (gut, skin, oral cavity, saliva, breast milk, amniotic fluid, as well as from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems) is just beginning and will shift to biological function in order to get insight in the bidirectional relationship between host and microbiota. The global initiative known as the Human Microbiome Project (started in 2007) aims to catalogue this balance. It is now realised that each person has a unique mix of bacteria and much of the diversity in healthy subjects remains unexplained. Nevertheless, communities of people have distinctive mixes of microbes and communities of microbes associated with a disease may be more or less diverse than controls. It is clear that Koch's postulates, which relate a given infectious disease to a single microbial species, are rarely applied for chronic diseases. Metagenome-wide association studies have demonstrated shifts that are associated with a variety of diseases like obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. The recent advancements also reinforced research for identifying microbes responsible for causing different types of cancers.",
