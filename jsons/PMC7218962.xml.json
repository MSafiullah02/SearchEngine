This outbreak was followed by the release of the first situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 20, 2020, and since then, a global pandemic has resulted in an increasing number of deaths [1\u20133]. The pandemic has resulted in uncertainty regarding when or whether the pandemic will end, and whether COVID-19 will follow the same clinical course as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) did 17 years ago. However, the current view is that this novel coronavirus infection will persist, and without a treatment, a vaccine is urgently required [4].",

However, COVID-19 is different from SARS based on its ability to spread globally. Currently, antiviral pharmaceuticals and immunotherapies are two principal therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 [6], whereas vaccines are still considered the most promising way to eradicate this virus [7]. In general, DNA-based and protein-based vaccines have been the major approaches for the development of stable and effective vaccines with less innate immunogenicity [8,9]. However, mRNA-based vaccines have become a potentially preventive approach, as they are safer, more efficient, and easier to manufacture [10]. Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, mRNA-based vaccine development seems to be an approach to prevent infection and to prevent a second wave of this pandemic.",

Therefore, it is unlikely that an effective vaccine will be developed in time to control the current pandemic. However, on March 16 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US), conducted by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [12,13]. The first patient enrolled in this phase 1 study was a 43-year-old woman at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, Washington, USA [12]. The phase I study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity, with the following trials currently being planned to evaluate the efficacy and effective dose of the new mRNA vaccine [13]. This review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.",

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus belongs to the subfamily of Coronavirinae, with a genomic structure of (+)ss-RNA of 30 kb in length that includes a 5\u2032-cap structure and 3\u2032-poly-A tail [15]. From the viral RNA, polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) is synthesized in the host to form 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that organize the replication-transcription complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). The nRTC synthesizes a set of minus-strand subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) discontinuously [16]. Between open reading frames (ORFs), transcription terminates, and then a subsequent acquisition of a leader RNA occurs. During this process, subgenomic mRNAs need these sgRNAs as the templates [14,17]. At least six ORFs exist for a typical CoV, including SARS-CoV-2.",

However, homology modeling disclosed that SARS-CoV-2 had a similar RBD structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues [19,20]. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a single animal source within a short period [21].

Due to different delivery methods, non-replicating mRNA vaccines are further divided as ex vivo loading of dendritic cell and direct in vivo injection into various anatomical sites [10]. The penetration of the lipid membrane barrier is the first step for exogenous mRNA to reach the cytoplasm before the translation of functional protein happen [24]. Also, the uptake mechanisms of mRNA vaccines show cell specificity [25], and the physicochemical properties of the mRNA may significantly influence its cellular delivery and organ distribution [26]. All these factors must be considered when designing an effective mRNA-based vaccine. Even so, an mRNA vaccine is still considered the most promising candidate because it can be scaled rapidly, which can save time when the rapidly spreading COVID-19 emerged and started to infect millions of people worldwide [7,27].",

This common phenomenon occurs more frequently in influenza viruses rather than in SARS viruses that only have a single arginine [31]. Also, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins have 29 amino acid residues that differ, 17 of which are located at the RBD site. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is much closer to the center of the trimeric S protein. One of the three RBDs in the S protein will spiral upwards to form a spatial conformation that helps the virus bind to the host receptor ACE2 easily, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 would be more infectious than SARS [32]. A cross-reactivity test of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the RBD monoclonal antibody of SARS, and it was found that this antibody did not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 [33]. These results provide an important structural biological basis for designing vaccines more accurately and discovering antiviral drugs.",

Therefore, a vaccine against S protein provides an approach for preventing the proliferation and spread of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine can prevent the initial activation of the S protein by blocking the S protein binding to ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in a transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) protein-coding gene-independent manner, and cathepsins B and L directly activate S protein in cells that do not express TMPRSS2, and SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Recently, Hoffmann et al. showed that the use of TMPRSS2 inhibitors significantly blocked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cell lines expressing TMPRSS2 and that promoting TMPRSS2 expression antagonized this inhibition [35]. Therefore, if the antibody titer of S protein is high enough to prevent the virus being engulfed into endosomes or undergoing fusion at the host cell surface, then virus infection associated with S protein activation and the intracellular release of the virus particles will be effectively inhibited.",

Secondly, ACE2 bioavailability will be significantly reduced, which helps mitigate the spread and infectivity of the virus [36]. Although empirical data from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 research have identified ACE2 as the primary portal for cellular entry of these two viruses [19\u201321], the probability of a membrane-associated co-receptor complex remains.

First, the intrinsic ratio of outer surface S protein per SARS-CoV-2 virion (s/v) may predetermine the preference of induced IgG in immunological responses. The inherent ratio of nucleotides to the S protein (n/s) may determine whether there are redundant S proteins when IgG effectively neutralizes the S protein, which reduces the immune efficacy of IgG. Therefore, both ratios will finally determine how high the antibody titer should be and how many vaccine boosters are needed so that it can effectively neutralize the virus without concerns about the existence of redundant S protein complexes that may effectively remove IgG antibodies to leave unblocked S protein available for processing and binding to ACE2. Although several previous studies have investigated this finding in human immunodeficiency viruse (HIV) infection and concluded that low spike density with wide spacing of the envelope spikes is unhelpful for the activation of B cells [37,38], this remains unclear for SARS-CoV-2, and it is a challenging factor for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.",

Direct evidence of functionally meaningful S protein mutations affects the S protein SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell ACE2, which appears to mediate a higher binding affinity when compared with SARS-CoV [40]. The reason for this increased S protein/ACE2 affinity in SARS-CoV-2 (\u221215.7 Kcal/mol) versus that of SARS-CoV (\u221214.1 Kcal/mol) is mainly attributed to three main factors [40]. First, the emergence of two loops around the RBDs in SARS-CoV-2 may promote its chemical interaction with ACE2 by increasing the number of atoms needed. Second, more amino acid residues in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 determine a higher number of protein-protein contacts between S protein and ACE2. Third, a longer capping loop in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 favors its interaction with the receptor. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure that the new vaccine that is targeted to S protein can be used long term or in the near future, it there is the possibility that the vaccine will not be effective because of mutations in the S protein.",

Glycosylation refers to the process in which proteins or lipids are linked to sugar chains by the action of enzymes. Glycosylation is one of the important forms of post-translational modification of proteins and is an essential way to regulate protein localization, function, persistence, and diversity [51,52]. For viruses, their replication and invasion into host cells are closely associated with the glycosylation of their structural proteins [53]. The main purpose of viral vaccine development is to evoke an immune response to fight the virus. However, the high glycosylation of proteins on the surface of the viral envelope works like invisible camouflage, which can help the virus to successfully escape the detection of the human immune system and achieve the purpose of survival [54,55]. Therefore, the higher the degree of glycosylation, the greater the probability that the virus will escape the immune response and the lower the success rate of vaccine development.",

SARS-CoV-2 includes highly glycosylated spherical particles and has a large structure containing at least 66 N-linked glycan sites, of which 54 sites show similarity with SARS-CoV [56]. In contrast, the glycan sites of HIV are between three times and six times that of the influenza virus, which is one of the major reasons why an HIV vaccine has not been successfully developed at this time [57]. However, SARS-CoV-2 has more than twice the glycan sites of HIV [58]. This unusual degree of glycosylation means that SARS-CoV-2 may mutate quickly, making the development of a vaccine extremely difficult. However, vaccine development failures caused by glycosylation remains significant, because vaccine design is based on the traditional inactivated or attenuated live vaccines, and different traditional vaccines may induce various glycosylation patterns of antibodies that subsequently affect the protective role of the antibodies [59]. However, the use of mRNA-based vaccine technology and targeting only the S protein, rather than the entire virus particle, may lead to the human immune system producing S protein antibodies without the influence of viral glycosylation.",

Given their beneficial properties, which include lack of persistence, lack of integration into the genome, the absence of induction of autoantibodies, the ability to produce mRNA vaccines in large quantities, and their high purity [61], an mRNA-based vaccine has become a hopeful choice for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Currently, no clinically applicable vaccine against COVID-19 is available, and even one of the first vaccines, mRNA-1273, is undergoing a phase I safety and immunogenicity trial [13]. The recently developed encapsulated RNA delivery and self-amplifying RNA technique assists in the ease of use of the mRNA vaccine with an increased success rate. However, several issues still need to be clarified for mRNA-based vaccines. Concerning the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the development of an effective and safe vaccine in time has become the most promising way to control the current viral pandemic. If currently available technology can be used to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which may be clinically applicable, this will give hope for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The best way should be sought to anchor the RNase inhibitor into the mRNA vaccine co-formulation and to develop new ways to purify or remove the mRNA vaccine-related reaction components.

Even though clinical trials of some vaccines have begun [13], there remain several technical issues that affect vaccine development and efficacy that require further study. First, strict bioinformatics analysis of the probability of a membrane-associated co-receptor complex is required to find the rate-limiting pattern of antibodies that affect ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding. The stoichiometric relationship between the S protein and the strength of the immune response requires studies on the intrinsic ratio of the outer surface S protein per SARS-CoV-2 virion (s/v) and nucleotides to the S protein (n/s). The precise function of viral self-defense proteins and the spherical configuration of the virion require further research, as does the mutation probability of the S protein that affects viral tropism and receptor affinity. There is also the potential hindrance of the high glycosylated state of the viral envelope to vaccine development.
