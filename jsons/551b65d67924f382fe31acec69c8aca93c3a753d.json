            "text": "Numerous epidemic models have been developed to capture aspects of human contact patterns, making model selection challenging when they fit (often-scarce) early epidemic data equally well but differ in predictions. Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the model's age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy tradeoff in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity.",

Mathematical models are routinely used in analysis of epidemic data and prediction of epidemic trends 3, 4 . A wealth of different options for how to describe social interactions in mathematical models is available, ranging from assuming homogeneous mixing 5, 6 , through analytically tractable models that focus on households, age structure or other idealised properties of the contact network 1, 2, 7, 8 , to complex individual-based stochastic simulations 1, [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, few comparative tools exist to guide the initial choice of structure when designing a mathematical modelling study. One common approach is statistical, comparing models by their ability to fit the data, or seeking a trade-off between the quality of data fitting and model parsimony. However, when data are limited, like at the beginning of an emerging epidemic, different models can fit the same data equally well and nevertheless lead to different predictions. These methods would then favour the simplest model, and would therefore not highlight whether further data should be collected to parameterise a more complicated model whose predictions can be significantly different.",

Such multi-model ensemble methods, well established in the field of numerical weather forecast 15 , have recently started gaining momentum in epidemiology [16] [17] [18] , with different modelling groups sometimes asked to perform predictions of the impact of realistic control policies based on shared scenarios 10, [18] [19] [20] [21] . These comparative studies have proven popular with complex models and policy makers concerned with over-reliance on advice from single modelling groups, but so far have provided little insight into the causes of differences between models. In addition, unidentifiability issues owing to the large number of parameters are sometimes not discussed, and often dealt with through an informal and difficultto-reproduce calibration procedure 22 . Furthermore, comparing models by fitting them to the same set of data (or small number of shared scenarios 23 ) provides results that are useful in that specific context but often hard to generalise to other settings 18, 23 or pathogens.",

We then test the ability of these different models to predict: the average final size (z), the average peak daily incidence (\u03c0) and the average time to the peak daily incidence (t) of a single epidemic wave. Given model AH includes all others as submodels, we compare predictions by assuming model AH perfectly represents reality and measuring other models' deviations from it. More specifically, we extensively explore the parameter space of model AH and for each parameter combination we compute, in addition to the outputs of interest, those quantities that are most likely to be measured or estimated from early data in the initial phase of the epidemic, namely: the basic reproduction number R 0 , i.e., the average number of cases a typical case generates in a fully susceptible population (this is not trivial for models with households; see Methods and Supplementary Methods, Sections 1.2.4 and 1.4); the ratio of adults versus children among new incident cases; and the household secondary attack rate (SAR), i.e., the average size of a withinhousehold outbreak. These quantities, hereafter referred to as the observables, are then used to map (i.e., compute deterministically, assuming no error or noise) the parameters of the models A, H and U, the outputs of which are then compared with the assumed-true ones of model AH and considered inaccurate when they differ by more than a specified threshold \u03b5 in relative terms. In computing model outputs and observables, we assume permanent immunity following infection, as well as constant parameter values and no demographic changes, i.e., we have in mind a relatively fast infection with negligible disease-induced mortality and no intervention nor behavioural or environmental change. In addition, despite the models used here being stochastic, for maximum computational efficiency we only focus on average values (infinite population limit).",

            "text": "Overview. As baseline scenario we consider: age and household structure of Great Britain, random mixing, R 0 = 2, adults and children equally infective (relative infectivity \u03d5 = 1) and an accuracy threshold \u03b5 = 5%. We fully explore the models' behaviour for a within-household infectious-adult-to-susceptible-adult transmission probability p aa ranging from 0 to 0.95 and for children from equally to four times as susceptible as adults (relative susceptibility \u03c8 ranging from 1 to 4) in Fig. 1 . We then compare models in Fig. 2 . Other values of R 0 (from 1.1 to 4) and \u03d5 (from 1 to 2), UK-like contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections and a markedly different social structure (corresponding to Sierra Leone) are then explored in Figs Baseline scenario. We first describe the outputs of each model in absolute terms in the baseline scenario. Model U predicts a final size z of 80%, a peak daily incidence \u03c0 of 5.5% and t = 9.8 generation times to the peak (we chose the generation time 37 as the time unit to facilitate translation to other infections). These values are common to all models (Fig. 1 , bottom-left corner of all panels) when there is no household transmission (within-household transmission probability p aa = 0) and children and adults are equally susceptible (relative susceptibility \u03c8 = 1). For a fair comparison, the parameter explorations for all models are performed at fixed R 0 , i.e., larger values of the within-household transmission probability p aa correspond to suitably smaller values of betweenhousehold transmission. Both the final size z (Fig. 1a ) and the peak incidence \u03c0 (Fig. 1b) appear to decrease when increasing age difference in susceptibility (i.e., increasing \u03c8): this result is known for the final size in the absence of households 5, 38, 39 , but appears to hold also for the peak incidence, and to extend to any amount of within-household transmission. Conversely, both outputs increase when transmission is shifted from between to within households (increasing p aa at constant R 0 ). Comparing Fig. 1a , d and g and b, e and h, it appears that, for both final size z and peak incidence \u03c0, model A is better than model H at mirroring the qualitative behaviour of model AH (though note that model H has only two free parameters, whereas model A has four, of which two shared with model AH: see description of model A in the Methods and Supplementary Discussion, Section 2. 1.2) . It also appears that the joint contribution of age and household structure in model AH can be roughly decomposed in the separate contribution of the two social structures (Fig. 1a , b contain elements of d and e for increasing \u03c8, and of g and h for increasing p aa ), but that models A ) and H (third row: g-i), the average epidemic final size z (first column: a, d and g), average peak daily incidence \u03c0 (second column: b, e and h) and average time to peak daily incidence t (third column: c, f and i; time expressed in multiples of the generation time T G ) are plotted as functions of the within-household transmission probability p aa and the relative susceptibility of children versus adults \u03c8. The top row (model AH) is assumed to be a perfect representation of reality. The outputs of model U are not plotted, as they are independent of both variables on the axes (they depend only on R 0 ), but can be read in the bottom-left corner of panels in each column, where predictions of all models coincide. The baseline scenario assumes: population structure of Great Britain, random mixing (same contact rates for adults and children in all environments, \u03b3 g = \u03b3 h = 1, and global assortativity of children \u03b8 g = 22.73%-within-household random mixing is always assumed), R 0 = 2 and children as infectious as adults (\u03d5 = 1).",

Figure 3a reports the overall simplest-model acceptance regions for varying values of R 0 and the relative infectivity of children versus adults \u03d5, still under baseline random mixing. For increasing R 0 (left to right), the household structure becomes less relevant for accurate predictions, unless within-household transmission is extremely high. Intuitively, at least for the final size, this is because at large R 0 almost all the population ends up infected, leaving very little room for stronger within-household transmission to increase it further (Fig. 1a) . Despite not being capped, as the final size is by the total population, the peak incidence shows a similar behaviour. Figure 3a confirms the intuition that, under random mixing, the age structure can be neglected when age classes do not differ much in susceptibility and that the household structure can be neglected when not much transmission occurs in households. Quantifying this intuition, however, is an important result of this analysis. On the other hand, when realistic UK contact patterns 25 are assumed, as in Fig. 3b , the age structure becomes absolutely crucial for accurate predictions, whereas the household structure remains important only at large values of withinhousehold transmission.",

            "text": "To facilitate intuition about the quantitative meaning of Fig. 3 , we locate points in the parameter space corresponding to some scenarios inspired by real infections. Scenario 1 is characterised by parameters in the ballpark of H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza (points 1): R 0 \u2248 1.5, \u03d5 \u2248 1, \u03c8 \u2248 2 33 and values of p aa from 0.1 to 0.4, corresponding to the wide range of SAR estimates found in the literature 35 , from <10% 40 up to 40% 35 . At the low end of this range, Fig. 3 suggests the household structure can be neglected, whereas at the high end the household structure should be retained, at least when mixing is heterogeneous (Fig. 3b , points 1). Scenario 2 has parameter values closer to those estimated for the 1918 influenza pandemic 34 , with a higher R 0 than in 2009, and children apparently not more susceptible but potentially more infectious than adults. We choose R 0 \u2248 2, \u03d5 \u2248 2, \u03c8 \u2248 1 and p aa \u2248 0.3 (leading to a SAR of~30% 34 ) and conclude that the household structure can (just about) be ignored, whereas the age stratification is necessary when mixing is heterogeneous (Fig. 3b, point 2) . However, we note that the higher transmissibility seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic compared to the 2009 one might be partially owing to a different demography and social structure, in particular with larger households. For Scenario 3, we imagine the hypothetical invasion in a fully susceptible population of a highly transmissible infection, with characteristics similar to common childhood infections like measles or chickenpox: R 0 \u2248 4, \u03d5 \u2248 1 and a trade-off between \u03c8 and p aa owing to the fact that only child-tochild estimates of transmission probability are available in the literature (see Supplementary Methods, Section 1.6.5). This leads to a range of possible points 3 in Fig. 3 , all of which suggest the household structure can be ignored, whereas the age stratification is essential. Applications to other topical emerging infections Fig. 3b (more precisely, the values of the SAR at each point of the 5% relative error contour lines, which are not explicitly drawn here to reduce clutter, but are shown as think black lines in Supplementary Fig. 16B ) for \u03d5 = 1, 1.5 and 2 and \u03c8 ranging from 1 to 4. Black data points give SAR values associated with more moderate and realistic differences in susceptibility and infectivity between adults and children (\u03c8\u03d5 \u2264 3) and are typically less widespread than grey data points, which correspond to extreme and unrealistic differences (\u03c8\u03d5 > 3). Regression lines (dashed) fit corresponding-colour data points, excluding R 0 = 1.1 and 4, where a linear fit looks unreasonable. The thick black line shows the empirical rule of thumb, with parameters reported in the figure (\u03b7 1 , regression coefficient; \u03b7 0 , intercept), and is empirically chosen to: be closer to the dark than the grey dashed line, reflecting low confidence in extreme differences between adults and children; and provide an acceptable fit for both the SAR values obtained assuming UK-like mixing (here) and random mixing (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.4). Note that part of the spread in the data points is owing to the ruggedness of the borders between regions (contour lines in Supplementary Fig. 16B ): a smaller step in p aa and \u03c8 would reduce the spread but increase the computational cost. (e.g., SARS, MERS, Ebola) would also be possible, though data scarcity and other limitations highlighted in the Discussion suggest conclusions in these cases would be rather tentative. Furthermore, parameter values for SARS and Ebola, with their marked lower susceptibility of children compared with adults 41 , would not appear in the range displayed in Fig. 3 .",

This dependence is explored more extensively in Fig. 4a , where the values of the SAR along the lines at which model A differ by 5% in relative terms from model AH (the borders between the light blue and red regions in Fig. 3b ) are collected for all values of \u03c8 ranging from 1 to 4 and for \u03d5 = 1, 1.5 and 2, and plotted against R 0 .

In fact, model A would have predicted a final size of 34% (compared with the 35% of model AH), which is much lower than the 58% of the homogeneously mixing model. Current estimates of the final size from retrospective analysis in Italy are even lower (in the range 15-30% 12, 46 ), but such discrepancy is easily imputable to interventions and spontaneous social distancing, and possibly a different demography and more refined age structure of these studies compared with the simple two-class one presented here.

The situation is more complex in the opposite case, as sometimes we have found the mapping from model AH to model A to fail (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.3). The insight is that, when children are less susceptible or infectious than adults, sometimes the mixing imposed by the household structure results in an age-stratified incidence that cannot be reproduced by an age-stratified model alone (with the same contact rates), irrespective of the level of assortative mixing assumed. In this sense, the household structure becomes essential to reconcile observed disease dynamics and measured contact rates of adults and children. More research, in particular, on the implications for public health, is needed in this direction. Except in this region of the parameter space, though, the household structure does appear in general less relevant for accurate predictions than the age structure (Fig. 3) . Throughout, we have assumed a 5% accuracy threshold, which is probably optimistic in an emerging epidemic scenario. However, the same result appears even more strikingly at less-stringent accuracy requirements, as the need for household structure drops, whereas the age structure, at least with heterogeneous and assortative mixing patterns, remains essential (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.2.2 and Supplementary Fig. 16) .",

Despite being chosen for their public health relevance, other outputs might be of more interest, depending on the question addressed. We then only presented results in terms of aggregate outputs (some comments on agestratified final size appear in the Supplementary Discussion, Sections 2.1.2 and 2.2.2). Furthermore, we also exploited the fact that model AH includes all the others as submodels and we were therefore able to compare predictions by studying the divergence of the outputs of simpler models from the assumed truth of model AH. Alternative choices would be required in the absence of a full model. Finally, we chose to keep R 0 fixed across all model, whereas another perhaps even more natural choice would have been to fix the real-time growth rate r. This would have been feasible in the case of models involving constant transition rates between compartments (analytical methods for computing r in the presence of household can be found, e.g., in 8 2) leads to similar results, with simpler models appearing even more likely to be accurate than the constant-R 0 comparison suggests. This is in line with previous results 42, 47 showing that ignoring the household structure in the time-since-infection model used here leads to an overestimation of R 0 : models with households, therefore, when forced to match the same R 0 , need to compensate with a slightly larger overall infectivity, and this leads to a larger final size and peak incidence, if instead the models are calibrated on the same r, no compensation in infectivity is needed and models with no households are likely more accurate on a larger region of the parameter space (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.2). However, not all aspect of the present study can be captured by the simple comparison of R 0 and r 42,47 , given past work is restricted to the exponentially growing phase, whereas the present study investigates also the late epidemic behaviour.",

The first and most obvious one is the lack of uncertainty: despite models being stochastic, the comparison is performed by deterministically mapping parameters from one model to another, thus ignoring the impact of any randomness, noise or estimation bias on model observables and outputs; in addition, final predictions are deterministic. It would not be difficult to compare the full distributions of model outputs, but more complicated results than binary acceptance/rejection of simpler models based on arbitrary thresholds would likely be harder to present and interpret. A more significant step would be to implement uncertainty in the model-mapping process. However, the choice we made in this study was to trade proper uncertainty management for the ability to perform extensive exploration of the space of observables, as any formal statistical estimation procedure, especially, if Bayesian in nature, would have been computationally challenging, and possibly difficult to automatise. Nevertheless, the role of uncertainty could still be roughly quantified by heuristically considering confidence intervals around each quantity in Fig. 3 (or similar figures, for values that do not appear there), given that boundaries appear to be changing monotonically with parameters: for example, for confidence intervals (1.5, 2) for R 0 and (20%, 40%) for the SAR, from Fig. 3 one can still conclude the clear need for age, and the need for household structure in the lowest R 0 range only when SAR >30% and with decreasing and ultimately vanishing need as R 0 increases (\u03d5 and \u03c8 are almost irrelevant).",

The contact patterns are given by \u03b3 A , the ratio of the overall number of contacts an adult and a child have, and the assortativity of children \u03b8 A . The transmission component of the model is parameterised in terms of an overall transmission parameter \u03b2 A and the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children versus adults, \u03c8 and \u03d5, which are thought of as biological parameters ideally accurately measured via detailed household studies, and are therefore assumed to be the same as in model AH. The presence of four parameters, two of which coincide by construction with those of model AH, makes model A both more flexible and more tightly linked to model AH than to model H (two parameters only). This partly explains why model A is better than model H at mirroring the outputs of model AH in Fig. 1 .",

At baseline, the population structure is that of Great Britain 61 , with a fraction F c = 22.73% of the population consisting of children and a mean household size \u03c7 = 2.35 (see Supplementary Methods, Section 1.6.1, and Supplementary Tables 1-4). Other social structures (South Africa: F c = 45.92%, \u03c7 = 4.27; Sierra Leone: F c = 53.81%, \u03c7 = 5.85) are explored in the Supplementary Methods, Section 1.6.2, Supplementary Tables 4-7 and Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.4. At baseline, contact patterns assume random mixing: \u03b3 h = \u03b3 g = 1 (adults and children have the same contact rates everywhere) and \u03b8 g = F c = 22.73%, the fraction of children in the population. Parameters for UK-like contact patterns, characterised by strongly assortative mixing, are estimated from the POLYMOD study 25 to be \u03b3 h = \u03b3 g = 0.75 and \u03b8 g = 58% (see Supplementary Methods, Section 1.6.3, and Supplementary Table 8), and are used also for other social structures (in the absence of contact pattern data for South Africa and Sierra Leone). Intermediate contact patterns are explored in the Supplementary Discussion (Section 2.3.1). The observables for model AH are derived as follows. The basic reproduction number R 0 is computed using a multitype extension of the technique developed in 60 that leads to the construction of a suitable matrix M (details in the Supplementary Methods, Section 1.2.4), the dominant eigenvalue of which is R 0 .From M it is also possible to reconstruct the vector v AH \u00bc v a ; v c \u00f0 \u00de > (superscript \u22a4 denotes transposition, to give a column vector), whose components are the fractions of adults and children in each generation (v AH is constant during the exponentially growing phase), correctly computed by taking into account both household and global transmission (Supplementary Methods, Section 1.2.5). Primary cases in households are infected globally, so arise in proportions given by the components of the vector v AH h \u00bc v a h ; v c h \u00c0 \u00c1 > , obtained by renormalizing K g v AH so that its components sum to 1.",
