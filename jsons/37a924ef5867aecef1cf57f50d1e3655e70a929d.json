New disease entities, new emerging species, and the changing spectrum of antibiotic susceptibility are examples of such challenges. Early in this century and before the advent of antibiotics, Staphylococcus was a major cause of morbidity and mortality. With the discovery of penicillin, it was thought that an upper hand had been achieved; however, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) escaped this threat by producing b lactamase that renders them resistant to penicillin. This stimulated the research for an alternative antibiotic, penicillinase-resistant penicillin, namely, cloxacillin and others. Again Staphylococci start to have some resistance, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which is now one of the major problems in health-care facilities. In addition, coagulase-negative Staphylococci are becoming important pathogens in many situations including neonates, immunocompromised host, and patient with implanted prosthetic devices.",

            "text": "The coagulase-positive staphylococcus is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is the commonest cause of human infections. It produces a variety of diseases that could be severe or mild. When antibiotics were initially introduced in the 1940s, S. aureus was sensitive to penicillin, and then it quickly became resistant which led to the introduction of b lactamase-resistant b lactam (methicillin, cloxacillin, and others). In the last 2 decades, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) emerged as an important pathogen, initially in health-care settings, but recently it is becoming common in community-acquired infections. MRSA carry a chromosomally mediated gene that mediates resistance through alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). MRSA is one of the major problems in hospital-acquired infections, especially in hospitals with burn and intensive care units. Many epidemics due to MRSA have been reported in NICU, PICU, and burn units. MRSA is not more virulent than methicillinsensitive S. aureus; however, it is difficult to treat because of its nature of being multiply resistant to many antibiotics including cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. They are usually susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolide, and daptomycin. Most of the hospital-associated MRSA strains are also resistant to other antibiotics like clindamycin, TMP/SMX, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) are less resistant and it tends to be sensitive to clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, and tetracycline. However, attention should be paid that some of CA-MRSA is also multidrug resistant. When an MRSA is sensitive to clindamycin",

Patients who are colonized with MRSA but have no disease should be isolated in private rooms and barrier precaution are applied. Treatment of such patients has failed to eradicate colonization. If epidemics arise due to MRSA, a trial to eradicate infection by treating all colonized patients with TMP/SMX combined with rifampin or ciprofloxacin may be beneficial. Patients who develop diseases due to MRSA should be treated with vancomycin and if they have intravascular devices attempts to remove such devices is advisable.

Upon arrival to ER, he was conscious and alert; however, he looks sick. His vital signs showed a temperature of 36.7 C, pulse rate 150 beats/min, respiratory rate 30/min, blood pressure 117/70, and pulse oximetry 98% in room air. He has normal chest and cardiovascular examination. His abdomen was soft. He has ice cold extremities with mottled skin and delayed capillary refill of around 6 s. He was judged to be in compensated shock likely of sepsis origin. Two boluses of intravenous normal saline at 20 ml/kg were given as well as a shot of ceftriaxone and vancomycin. His condition was worsening gradually with increasing work of breathing and desaturation. Arterial blood gas was done and showed pH 7.12, PCO2 52, PO2 28, HCO3 17, and base access 12.2 and therefore oxygen 5 L/min by face mask was given and he was continued on intravenous maintenance fluid.

His condition deteriorated farther with drop in blood pressure and increasing difficulty in ventilating him. Chest x-ray showed white out lungs suggestive of ARDS. He was started on dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine but his blood pressure remained low and his heart rate started to drop and became asystolic and not responding to resuscitation. He died by 3:30 next morning. Two bottles of blood culture was positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which was identified as S. aureus; methicillin resistant based on MicroScan result which was confirmed by cefoxitin diffusion disk as well as positive PBP.

Diagnosis is by isolating CONS from blood that is drawn from the central line. Some quantitative estimates of the number of CONS colonies can help in differentiating colonization from infection. This can be done by semiquantitative method in which the intravascular tip of the catheter is rolled over the culture media. If the number of colonies grown is more than 15 colonies then it indicates significant growth. If the line cannot be removed then comparing the colonies count of blood drawn from central line with that drawn from peripheral vein will give an idea of the source of infection. If the central count is more than peripheral one then this is likely to be central line infection. However, these methods are not standardized and cumbersome to do. Treatment requires removal of the central line and administration of appropriate antibiotics; however, in cases where removal of the line is not feasible, a trial of antibiotic therapy may result in cure although the failure rate is more common. The recommended therapy is vancomycin given through the central line for 10-14 days. Blood culture should be repeated in 24-48 h after starting the antibiotics.

Clinical presentations of shunt infection are variable, but mostly present with signs of shunt malfunction and increased intracranial pressure including headache, vomiting, and fever. Some patients may have associated signs of peritonitis. Treatment of VP shunt infection has been controversial. The recommended treatment is shunt removal with systemic antibiotics administration. Alternatively, success has been achieved with externalizing the peritoneal end of the shunt and systemic antibiotics administration until the CSF culture is negative in 3 consecutive days then reimplantation of the shunt and continuation of systemic antibiotics for 10-14 days. Intraventricular administration of antibiotics has shown some contradictory results; however, most of the studies show no additional benefit of such therapy.",
