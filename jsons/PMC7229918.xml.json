To date, many urological centres have prioritised their patients for urgent surgical intervention because of a reduction in operating theatre availability and the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection [1], [2]. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Republic of Ireland was diagnosed on February 29, 2020 and as of May 8, 2020, there have been 22 385 confirmed COVID-19 cases, which represents a case rate of 453.3 per 100 000 population [3]. Here we present our perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing urological surgery during the initial stage of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Ireland (between March 16 and May 1, 2020, inclusive).",

Elective surgery was prioritised according to recent European guidelines and patients were then placed on a centralised departmental theatre waiting list [1].

At present, various guidelines and opinions on preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols are available (eg, thorax computed tomography vs nasopharyngeal swab). However, such guidelines are limited by their level of evidence as, to date, they are based on expert opinion without robust prospective data [4]. Our current departmental policy is to perform a screening telephone interview 7 d before surgery and to advise elective patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 to self-isolate. A second screening telephone interview in conjunction with a nasopharyngeal swab is carried out 24\u201348 h before all elective surgery cases.",

Diagnosis of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection is difficult, as symptoms mimic common postoperative surgical complications (eg, atelectasis). Patients who experience postoperative COVID-19 are likely to develop significant respiratory complications and have a prolonged inpatient admission. Information from this study will enable surgeons to balance the risk of delaying urgent surgical procedures against the increased morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
