            "text": "An unexpected increase of heat indicates that something is wrong. This might be one of these universal truths which are almost to sweeping and far-reaching to be credible. In the world of mechanics, increased friction develops heat and causes wear which can led to material failure [1]. Therefore, heat pattern and indeed heat pattern changes give a good indication of machine health [2]. By a striking coincidence, diagnosing via heat pattern is not limited to mechanical systems both electronic and biological systems follow the same pattern. Especially, the human body temperature has been linked to health since the time of Hippocrates [3]. Since then, the diagnostic accuracy was linked to the instruments used for temperature measurement. Therefore, the discovery and capture of Infrared (IR) radiation from the human body, by Herschel in 1800, was a big step forward [3]. These measurements are based on the physical phenomena, that all objects, including the human body, with a temperature above absolute zero (\u2212273 K) emit IR radiation from their surface [4]. Experiments showed that human skin emits IR radiation essentially in the range of 2\u201320 \u03bcm wavelengths, with an average peak at 9\u201310 \u03bcm. Despite this understanding, it took until 1934 before Hardy described the physiological role of IR emission from the human body. He put forward that both physiological processes and thermal properties of the skin are influenced by a wide range of factors, because the skin helps to manage the core body temperature. These factors change in the presence of disease, hence IR measurements can be used for diagnostic purposes [5]. This fundamental understanding paved the way for IR thermography as a body imaging modality for medical sciences. The first use of this new technology was reported in the year 1960, it took so long because quality equipment and technical knowhow was unavailable [6]. Since 1963 it is known that heat patterns, shown in thermographic images taken with IR cameras, provide information about physical anomalies, such as cancer, especially breast cancer, infection, eye disease, diabetes and pain [7]. However, having a qualitative statement based on general observations is something different from a quantitative statement, which expresses how useful the method is for medical diagnosis [8]. In terms of medical applications, the usefulness of a particular diagnostic method can be expressed in terms of the ability to deliver a correct diagnosis, the side effects and the cost.",

            "text": "Heat pattern measurement, via thermography, is fast, non-contact, non-invasive, it is even passive, i.e. no potentially harmful radiation is sent through the biological system, only the body heat is captured [9]. The body would give up this heat radiation in any case, regardless of whether or not it is measured. Passive imaging modalities for medical applications attract much interest, because they are 100% side effect free [10]. Therefore, the US clinical community viewed medical thermography as an exciting and very promising technology for a variety of diagnostic applications, in the decade that followed after the first appearance of IR body images [11]. However, despite this striking advantage over other imaging modalities and the initial enthusiasm, medical thermography has been in decline since 1980 [12]. During this time, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) started the widely cited Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) [13]. One major finding of this project was that thermography is ineffective for breast cancer screening [14]. In retrospect, this study had serious shortcomings in the way thermography images were captured [15]. To be specific, only five out of 27 participating cancer centers had sufficiently qualified personal for taking and assessing thermography images. Gautherie et al. pointed out that a lack of technical skill and expertise for thermography image interpretation leads to a sharp decline in diagnostic accuracy [16]. The need for quality assurance, during the act of image acquisition, is further emphasized by the fact that the high false positive range of 10\u201330% depends on the disease and the technique used. In recent years, proper protocol, such as equipment considerations preparation of patient, examination environment, and standardization of thermal imager system have been discussed elaborately in [17], [18], [19], [20]. This lead to the postulation of image capture protocols [21], [22]. So, on an abstract level, Infrared Thermography (IRT) based diagnosis suffered from interoperator dependency and inadequate equipment. As a consequence, in 1982 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved thermography only as a supplement to mammography for breast cancer screening [23]. The FDA enforced this judgment in 2011 when the organization issued a press release stating that: \u201c\u2026the FDA is unaware of any valid scientific evidence showing that thermography, when used alone, is effective in screening for breast cancer \u2026\u201d [24].",

One of these scientific principles is transparent and objective performance assessment. Therefore, in this review we report the perforce of thermography based diagnostic systems for diabetes, infection, cancer, eye diseases and pain. Based on this review, we adopt the position that thermography image interpretation can be aided with computer preprocessing. From there it is just a small, but important step, to automate the diagnosis process as well. The importance of this step comes from the promise of progress: As computing machines get more capable, and algorithms improve, the diagnostic accuracy will increase. Another important benefit of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is cost efficiency. Once these systems are up and running, the operation cost is low, when compared with expert human labor. Furthermore, CAD systems integrate seamlessly into digital work-flows of modern hospitals. This high level of integration and the low human interaction results in two beneficial properties: fast throughput and centralized processing. As a result, there is a real chance that future thermography based CAD systems will deliver unparalleled safety together with a high level of reliability and diagnostic accuracy.",

It provides insight into both extent and nature of randomness and it shows how disordered the image pixels are. There are two categories of entropy: Shannon and non-Shannon [43]. Over a range of scattering conditions, Shannon entropy has a lower dynamic range than non-Shannon entropies. This makes non-Shannon entropies more useful in estimating scatter density and regularity. Examples of non-Shannon entropies, that can be used to extract features for automated disease diagnosis, are: Renyi\u2019s, Kapur\u2019s and Yager\u2019s entropy [44], [45], [46].",

These sharp borders shape high frequency DWT coefficients with high levels of location (spatial) accuracy. In contrast, larger objects with smooth edges shape low frequency coefficients with low spatial resolution [48]. The DWT coefficients are established by sending a signal through a sequence of down-sampling low- and high-pass filters [49], [50]. The low- and high-pass filter output is known as approximation and detail coefficients respectively.

Fever happens if the hypothalamus detects pyrogens and then raises the set point. IR thermography systems are very well suited for non-contact blind mass fever scanning, because image capturing is fast, non-invasive, and it is able to reliably detect people with fever. Therefore, this technique was used to detect inflammatory abnormalities and it has the potential to become a tool for mass scanning of fever [122]. Fig. 3\nshows three thermogram images captured during a fever scanning exercise. The square box in the thermograms indicates the ROI. Users need to carry out pre-screening system verification to verify and fine tune the settings by comparing the screening result with a calibrated clinical thermometer. Since the thermal imager measures the skin temperature and not the body core temperature, the threshold setting needs to take into consideration the physiological site offset and the performance characteristics of the thermal imager in order to obtain a reliable screening operation. Studies show that there is a correlation between the human skin surface temperature and the body core temperature. However, the extent of correlation depends on the changes in skin temperature. Skin temperature may be altered at different environmental and physiological conditions. Skin temperature may not have direct relationship to the infectious stages of the diseases.

Therefore, in normal breast thermograms, symmetric heat patterns are observed in both breasts, but in the case of an unilateral abnormality, asymmetry is observed. Thermography is especially well suited for picking up tumors in their early stages or tumors in dense tissue and in these scenarios it outperforms other modalities, such as mammography [142]. Fig. 4\nshows normal (Fig. 4a) and malignant (Fig. 4b) thermography images of the female breast. The malignant part is clearly visible in Fig. 4b. Studies have shown a high correlation between obviously abnormal thermograms and increased breast cancer risk as well as a poorer prognosis for the breast cancer patient [14], [16]. A constant irregular thermogram carries a 22 times higher risk than its regular counterpart and it is 10 times more indicative than a first-order family history of the illness as a future risk signal for breast cancer. Studies have indicated that an irregular IR image is probably the single most crucial risk marker for the presence, or future growth, of breast cancer [147].

We found that over the years tremendous progress was made in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of these systems. This progress was fueled by better sensors [156], [207], diagnostic procedure [169], [221], [222], [223], more computing power and a deeper understanding of the processing algorithms [224], [225], [226], [227]. Standardization and quality assurance efforts, such as the human skin temperature atlas database, have deepened and solidified this progress [228], [229], [230], [231], [232]. However, in terms of applicability of thermography based CAD systems, there is still a mixed picture. On the one hand there are the novel applications, such as dry eye and pain indication, where thermography is the only viable imaging modality, on the other hand there are applications where thermography stands in direct competition with active imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and X-ray. When the CAD systems, for the novel applications, reach majority they will be a great help for physicians to diagnose diseases, such as pain, for which it was historically difficult to reach a conclusive diagnosis [233]. The picture is different for applications of thermography where there is direct competition from active imaging modalities. The main advantage of active imaging modalities comes from the fact that an active system knows what signal was send out and what signal was received. So, these systems can analyze the changes the human body did to these signals. Thermography does not have the benefit of knowing the signal source, because it is the body itself which radiates the signals. Unfortunately, the ways in which the body generates heat are only rudimentarily understood.",

During our review, we recognized that the most advanced analysis methods were used in areas where thermography has a strong competition. There is a strong correlation between competition and system quality in the area of breast cancer screening, where thermography is recognized only as an adjunct tool to mammography [234], [235]. Mammography is accepted as the most reliable and cost-effective imaging modality, however its contribution continues to be challenged with persistent false-negative rates ranging up to 30% [236]. In light of the continued controversy surrounding established breast imaging modalities, such as mammography [237], [238], a number of new and emerging technologies are being developed for breast cancer screening and diagnosis [239]. Even back in 1973, it was established that the combination of thermography and mammography achieves better results, for diagnosing asymptomatic breast cancer, then each method individually [240]. However, the interpretation of thermograms is heavily dependent on the analysts, which may be inconsistent and error-prone [89]. Therefore, breast cancer screening with IR imaging has still a weaker position [241]. But as a consequence of this struggle, IR based breast cancer screening is the area where most of the progress was made. The progress in this field is documented by the fact that in this review 20 studies, out of 32, report a measure of diagnostic quality, i.e. either A, Se or Sp. The increase in diagnostic quality is fueled by two facts: (a) IR cameras are getting better and cheaper, (b) Computing machinery is getting ever more powerful and there are better algorithms [242], [243]. At least the later point is also true for mammography, but for this imaging modality the margins of improvement are rather slim. Therefore, we predict that over the coming years the progress of thermography will outpace the progress of mammography for breast cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, the image of thermography for breast cancer screening might be better in the general public than in the research community, because a survey shows that online advertising for thermography is effective and woman consider the uptake of alternative breast imaging services over mammography [244].",

For these different measurements, there is no need for to establish the symmetrical heat pattern for a large group of normal subjects, i.e. there is no need to establish or indeed rely on a pre-established heat pattern atlas. For contralateral asymmetry based studies normal subjects are used to establish the control group. Diagnostic progress is made by applying image processing and feature extraction algorithms which extract information from the differences in skin temperature pattern between the two feet. However, our review shows that these feature extraction algorithms and the subsequent machine classification is not applied consistently. To be specific, the PE column of Table 1 shows that no classification algorithms were used for performance evaluation.",

The most significant problem associated with the use of thermal imagers comes from the fact that there is no objective way to determine the body temperature of an individual [246]. The correlation of IRT temperatures with the core temperature is significant but weak [247]. The measurements do not depend on skin color, they depend on skin surface properties such as wrinkled or shiny skin, dry or sweaty skin, emissivity, reflectivity and transmissivity [248]. On the positive side, this imaging modality saves time (temperature is displayed within a few seconds) and it reduces close contacts with infected individuals [249]. However, the effectiveness in a practical setting is hard to asses. For example, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, thermal scanning of over 35 million international travelers entering Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, and Singapore did not pick up a single SARS case [250]. One reason for this mediocre performance might be the simple thresholding methods which were used during the fever scanning. More advanced feature extraction algorithms and the combination of multi-sensor data, similar to the system proposed by Sun et al. [81], might improve the performance of these CAD systems.",

Computer support reduces the diagnostic workload and the experts can focus on the hard cases and thereby increase the level of care. The second area is inter-observer variability. Relying entirely on the human brain, thermogram based diagnosis tends to be subjective and the quality varies widely. Objective methods, from the area of computer science and mathematics, can help to objectify the diagnosis and thereby reduce the inter-observer variability. The last area is concerned with the diagnosis quality. Human based diagnosis is largely based on both experience as well as mental state of the screening practitioner and to a lesser extent from equipment and diagnostic method. Hence, progress depends on the level of training and the experience in the field. For algorithm supported diagnosis progress is made in terms of hardware and software. Computing machinery will get more and more potent; this is independent of any individual application area. Progress in the software domain will come from integrating and to a lesser extent from inventing signal processing algorithms as well as managing an ever growing knowledge base.

The majority of researchers in this area published performance results in terms or sensitivity and specificity. The resulting competition has driven thermography based breast cancer systems to include the most advanced signal processing algorithms.

These restrictions do not, or at least to a much lesser extent, apply to computing machinery. From this perspective, the direction for thermography diagnosis is clear: more data. This data can come from higher resolution IR scanning, but the main contribution will be existing datasets and case studies. For a human it is impossible to make sense of all available thermography images; however machines can process these images and extract relevant information. Staying with the idea of more or big data, there is no need to limit CAD systems to one data source alone. Computer based systems can make sense of data from various sources, such as thermography, X-ray, ultrasound, etc. At the end, the work is not about thermography or indeed any other imaging modality, it is about alleviating human suffering in patients and loved ones. This leaves no space for an unreasonable focus on just one imaging modality.",
