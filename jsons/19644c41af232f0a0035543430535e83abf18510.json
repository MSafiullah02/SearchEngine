Personnel working with transferable agents are acquainted with hazards that require the proper training and skillful practices for handling such materials. All laboratories are required to develop a biosafety or operations manual that categorizes the hazards that may be met, and that specifies the proper practices and techniques to reduce/or minimize the hazard exposures. A microbiologist/scientist, and knowledgeable laboratory techniques, safety procedures, and hazards associated with handling transferrable agents will accountable for the comportment of research with infectious agents or materials. The proper design and work structures, safety equipment, and controlling practices should enhance the laboratory personnel and safety practices. Cliffe (2016) has mentioned that many biosafety levels (BSLs) have been developed for laboratories to enhance the protection levels of environment and staff. BSLs have standard guidelines that described the proper containment equipment, services, and procedures for apply by laboratory researchers/scientists/technicians/ students. The BSLs are categorized into BSL 1 to BSL 4, and the risk associated with every BSL increases with the infectious microbes encountered. BSL 2 practices are mostly followed by clinical microbiology laboratories. When conducting works with high transmissible agents, the risk of aerosol transmission is so high, so microbiology laboratories must follow BSL 3 practices. In Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) denotes a fundamental level of containment that be contingent on standard microbiology practices with never requiring any special primary or secondary barriers recommendation, other than washing hand. BSL-2 practices are appropriate to teaching, diagnostic, clinical, and other laboratories in which work has conducted wide-range of indigenous moderate-risk agents that are available in the community and allied with human disease.",

            "text": "Principles of Good Microbiological Practices (Chosewood and Wilson 2009) 1. Never uses any pipette substance by mouth. In laboratory always avoid contact hand to mouth or hand to eye. In the laboratory, never drink, eat, apply cosmetics, lip balm, handle contact lenses and taken medication. 2. Aseptic techniques properly use. Right way wash your hand after removing gloves, other personnel protective equipment (PPE), handling potentially infectious agents or materials and exiting of laboratory. 3. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) have recommends that laboratory personnel must be protected their streetwear clothing from contamination by wearing appropriate attire (e.g., gloves, lab shoes or use shoe covers) when conducting works in BSL-2 laboratory. Streetwear clothing and street shoes are not permitted for use in BSL-3 laboratory; in the lab always preferred to change of streetwear clothes and shoe covers or shoes keen for uses. In BSL-4 is mandatory changed from streetwear clothes/ shoes to use the permitted laboratory attires and footwear. 4. Once removing the hazardous material in the laboratory, personnel must be followed Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). When infectious agents are handled in laboratories; syringes, and needles or other sharp instru- ments should be restricted. A used needle never repetited. Dispose of syringeneedle assemblies in properly labeled, lesion resistant, autoclavable sharps containers. 5. Knob infectious materials as determined by a risk assessment. Airborne infectious agents should be controlled by a certified biosafety cabinet (BSC) appropriate to the BSLs and risks for the agent. 6. Make sure that engineering controls (e.g., eyewash, BSCs, safety showers, and sinks) are properly maintained and inspected. 7. The contaminated lab ware or materials never leave open to the outside of BSC. All biohazardous materials steadily stored with proper labeled, and sealed containers. 8. Must be displayed all laboratories doors with the recognized biohazard symbol, a list of the infectious agents, access requirements (e.g., PPE) and emergency contact information. 9. Avoid the use of aerosol-producing techniques when working with infectious materials. Pipette mixing, needle clipping, centrifugation, and sonication can generate considerable aerosols. 10. Antiseptic traps and inline filters on vacuum lines are used to defend vacuum lines from contamination. 11. Follow the laboratory biosafety design for the infectious materials that are conducting with the accurate decontamination methods to decontaminate the infectious materials. Always keep spill kits available in the lab for managing an accidental spill of pathogenic materials. 12. Clean the worktable area with an appropriate disinfectant after conducting work with infectious materials in the laboratory. Must not be cluttered the laboratory containment in order to authorize suitable floor and disinfect work area. 13. Without decontaminated or sterilized or autoclaved (temperature (121 \u00b0C), pressure (15 psi), and time (15-20 min)), never allow to leave unwanted infectious materials or contaminated agents in the laboratory or to be put in the sanitary sewer. 14. When transferring or shipping infectious materials to other laboratory, always use Postal or Department of Transportation (DOT) approved, leak-proof sealed and properly packed containers (primary and secondary containers). Be sure the lid is on tight and avoiding the container contamination from the outside. Before transporting infectious materials, make sure that the outside of container is decontaminated. Ship infectious materials in accordance with Federal and local necessities. 15. All accidents, occurrences, and unexplained illnesses must be reported to lab technician/supervisor and the Occupational Health Physician. 16. Always think safety first priority during laboratory operations. Evoke, if you are not clearly apprehend the proper handling and safety procedures or how properly use safety equipment; avoid conducting work with the infectious materials until you get proper instruction or consult the CDC/NIH BMBL for further information.",
