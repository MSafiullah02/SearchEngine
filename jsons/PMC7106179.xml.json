Rare causes, such as pneumonia from atypical agents from an undiagnosed immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, methemoglobinemia, and pulmonary malformations, should be entertained as possible components of the differential diagnosis in the ED. In this child, the differential diagnosis narrows significantly to a pulmonary etiology in a patient who had infiltrates on chest radiograph and whose respiratory distress and hypoxia responded readily to supplemental oxygen, making the diagnosis of congenital heart disease unlikely.",

Bronchiolitis is a lower airway disease mostly affecting the bronchioles, causing acute inflammation, edema, increased mucus production, and bronchospasm. Viral bronchiolitis typically presents with upper respiratory symptoms followed by lower respiratory infection resulting in wheezing and rales in children younger than two years of age. Common pathogens of viral bronchiolitis include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus. Findings on a chest radiograph are almost always nonspecific but may include hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, and patchy atelectasis. Bronchiolitis is therefore a clinical diagnosis; quality improvement guidelines typically discourage the routine use of imaging. The causative agent may be confirmed by antigen detection or immunofluorescence of respiratory secretions, and treatment is mainly supportive.1\n",

Physical exam may reveal crackles, decreased breath sounds over areas of consolidation, rhonchi, or wheezing. Though viral pneumonia is more common in infants, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptoccocus pyogenes may also cause pneumonia in infants, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common pathogen. Chest radiograph typically reveals a focal area of consolidation. In older school-aged children, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are also common pathogens. Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered in patients at risk, particularly in children with a seizure disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depressed mental status, neurologic disease, or dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonia can be caused by anaerobic oral flora including anaerobic Streptococci, Fusobacterium spp, Bacteroides spp, and Prevotella melaningenica and need to be appropriately covered with antibiotics that are effective against anaerobic bacteria.",
