The success of viruses during evolution has been possible due to three general attributes: genetic variation, the variety of forms for their transmission and the efficient way to replicate within their host cells in order to remain in them [2,3]. Due to these attributes, the control of viral diseases throughout history has not been an easy task [4]. In spite of the existence of antiviral drugs, it is necessary to explore novel antiviral compounds in order to control emerging viral pathogens [4,5].",

Research in this regard is focused on the development and refinement of techniques to design and identify synthetic and natural peptides as drug candidates [1,6]. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) are known to fight against various types of viruses and can come from synthetic combinatorial libraries or segments of natural proteins [5,6]. There are different scenarios in which the AVPs have shown activity, e.g. Enfuvirtide (also known as T20), the first peptide inhibitor approved by the FDA against the HIV-1 [7]. Antiviral activity has also been reported for viruses, e.g. Rabies [8], HCV [9], influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10], among others.",

However, unlike the development of bioinformatics tools in the field of antimicrobial peptides predictions (bacteria, fungi, animal cells) [15], the development of in silico tools for the prediction of AVPs is an area that has remained scarcely explored [11]. Currently, there are only three methods for predicting AVPs. The first one is the AVPpred server, which uses a vector support machine (SVM) for its predictions [11]. The second method is based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm and the resulting model of this work showed a better performance in the prediction of AVPs than AVPpred [16]. However, this model has not software to carry out prediction tasks by researchers who are not related to the field of machine learning. The third method, AVP-IC50Pred, was developed by Quresshi and coworkers. AVP-IC50Pred is a regression-based algorithm which uses experimentally proven datasets by employing multiple machine learning algorithms [17]. In this work, we have developed a friendly and portable software based on the RF algorithm for the prediction of AVPs with excellent performance measurements.",

AntiVPP 1.0 returns two types of predictions: 'True' for positive cases and 'False' for negative cases. In addition, the software performs the computation of several peptide features, which are the characteristics used for this program in AVPs classifications.",

Over the last 50 years, extensive efforts have been dedicated to the development of antiviral drugs and great success has been accomplished for some viruses. Nevertheless, there are other viral infections such as epidemic influenza, which continue to spread worldwide and new threats of viruses, as well as drug-resistant viruses, are continuously emerging [23]. Peptide-based drugs have been of great interest to the scientific community from the past decade to the present, given that the modern pharmaceutical industry has come to appreciate the role of these molecules in addressing unmet medical needs. All this is because the peptides can be an excellent complement or even a more suitable alternative to small molecules and biological therapeutics [25]. Regardless of the potential of AVPs, there is a considerable lack of algorithms for AVPs prediction compared to other areas such as the investigation of antimicrobial peptides.",
