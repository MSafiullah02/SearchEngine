A way of testing the adequacy of the structures is to prove the correct orientation of each communicative action towards a preceding action. We refer to this orientation leading to a certain response as the affordance of the communicative action. In this paper we present a case study where affordances of implemented conversational structures (including verbal and graphical elements) in a multimodal medical QA system are identified applying Conversation Analysis (CA) tools and tested using the Cognitive Walkthrough (CW) method. The CW method was modified to fit the conversational approach and tested with five expert evaluators. Results showed that the affordance analysis helps detecting inefficient constructions leading to disruptions in the dialog flow, spots unnecessary functions and provides important insights on systems easy-of-use.",

Norman in [1] , many researchers such as Gaver, Hartson and Noman himself struggled with several definitions and categorizations in an effort to clarify the concept making it operational for evaluations. Section 2 comments in details these theoretical considerations. In section 3 some short examples of practical applications of affordances are presented followed by section 4, where the affordance concept is integrated in the framework of the conversational analysis protocols. The case study, including methodology, short system overview, questionnaire and scenario design are presented in section 5. The results are largely discussed in section 6. This paper ends with conclusions containing the result summarization and improvement suggestions for the QA interface.",

Gibson defined the term \"affordance\" as latent action possibilities existing in an environment independent of the individual's ability to perceive them. These action possibilities are in relation with the actor's capabilities of action being independent of his culture, prior knowledge or expectations. Any substance, any surface, any layout has some affordances with respect to a certain actor. According to his theory, the action possibilities indicated by affordances are perceived visually in a direct way that does not require mental information-processing activity, i.e. the immediate perception of the environment will inevitably lead to a certain action.",

Therefore, the actor may need to learn first to discriminate the information he gets from the environment in order to perceive it directly [4] .

Since new media technologies such as interactive information systems like QA or dialog systems are design artifacts that use elaborated conversational structures with preponderate verbal text elements there is a strong need to consider such elements as integral parts of the interaction design. Therefore, we propose a design evaluation that uses the affordance concept to analyze text units and graphical elements.",

Interlocutors can express their communicative intentions both verbally (through speech) and non-verbally (through gesture and mimic). Analyzing the organization of each conversational sequence it can be determined what kind of action possibilities (affordances) have the participants in a certain moment of the conversation.

By selecting the option \"typing\" an input field appears on the same window. The input field affords sentence-like questions as well as keywords. Most of the evaluators -excepting one-considered that the full sentence capability won't be easily perceived by more experienced users; they would probably associate the system's functionality with the one of a typical search engine and consequently would use keywords. The presence of a relatively extended input field is not a clear indication of the expected input and if sentence-like input is desired a short how-to-ask example should be provided.

The affordance of certain conversational structures like greetings in the middle of an interaction shows a cooperative behavior. However, it is unlikely that someone would use greetings at that particular conversational stage. Special features like pointing or drawing on a virtual surface should be briefly introduced to users.
