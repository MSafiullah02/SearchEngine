Manipulation and traumatism of the airways predispose patients to viral reactivation in the oropharyngeal mucosa and upper airway, with subsequent micro-aspiration to more distal airways, thereby causing potential lung parenchyma involvement [10, 14] . Therefore, viral reactivation on the tracheobronchial mucosa could explain, in some cases, how respiratory infection presents without any evidence of viruses in the oropharyngeal mucosa [12, 16] .

Subsequently, serological evidence of mimivirus has been reported in between 7 % and 9 % of patients with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia [37, 38] .",
