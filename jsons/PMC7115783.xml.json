However, these are only the latest in a series of outbreaks of novel diseases in humans during the last decade of the 20th century highlighting the need for focus on the zoonotic (animal) origin of viral infections. For instance, avian influenza H5N1 was identified in Hong Kong in 1997 (Mounts et al., 1999); Rift Valley fever caused an estimated 27,500 human infections and reported loss of approximately 70% of livestock (primarily sheep and goats) in Garissa District, Kenya, in 1997\u20131999 with reports of disease in four other provinces in Kenya as well as in Somalia and Tanzania (Woods et al., 2002); an outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998\u20131999 caused at least 283 human cases of encephalitis and 109 deaths (Chua, 2003) with an estimated 1.1 million pigs culled in efforts to stop transmission (FAO and APHCA, 2002); and outbreaks of West Nile virus occurred in Europe from 1996 to 1999 (Hubalek and Halouzka, 1999) and the United States beginning in 1999 (WHO, 2012). In 2001 Taylor and colleagues (Taylor et al., 2001) inventoried known human infectious disease pathogens and pointed out that 61% of all pathogens and 75% of emerging disease pathogens were zoonotic in origin. About 80% of human viral pathogens are zoonotic (Morse et al., 2012, Taylor et al., 2001).",

At a conference convened by the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Rockefeller University in 2004, the movement gained its trademarked name and issued a call to action, embodied in the \u201cManhattan principles\u201d for preventing emerging diseases in human and animal population and maintaining ecosystem integrity (WCS). By 2008, the UN Agencies and the World Bank had drafted a strategic framework, introduced at the \u201cOne World, One Health: From Ideas to Action\u201d Conference in Winnipeg, Canada, in 2009 (PHAC, 2009). The premise of One Health is that people, animals and the environment form an interdependent ecosystem that needs to be considered in a coordinated manner (FAO et al., 2008, Frank, 2008). It rests on a conceptually simple model that focuses on contact \u2013 and therefore the potential for transmission of disease \u2013 between wild and domestic animals and humans (usually depicted as three overlapping circles) in the context of the environment.",

It has also fostered discussions on the factors that are contributing to spillover of diseases from animals to humans, the first step in an outbreak. Most of the discussions to date about drivers of emergence (Daszak et al., 2000; A. Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001, Karesh et al., 2012, Patz et al., 2004, Smolinski et al., 2003) have focused on anthropogenic land use changes \u2013 essentially resource exploitation (logging, mining, establishment of plantations, dam building) and associated road building and pollution. These factors are fundamental drivers of disease emergence in wildlife through their effects on habitat fragmentation, biodiversity and host-pathogen dynamics. A second set of frequently mentioned drivers focuses on movement of hosts and pathogens through travel and the transport and trade of animals and animal products. Finally, increased human-animal contact occurs because of increasing human population density and its consequences \u2013 encroachment of humans into previously undisturbed areas and the development of larger scale or more intensive animal production systems (Slingenbergh et al., 2004).",

A. Alexander and McNutt, 2010). For example, Chua et al. (2002) suggested that the first documented outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia was precipitated by a combination of ecological and social factors. The ecological factors included El Ni\u0148o-cycle related drought, land use change (deforestation and reduced habitat for fruit bats due to logging) and fire arising from slash and burn agriculture that displaced bats to orchards in Ipoh. In addition, key factors included local practices regarding location of piggeries in and near fruit orchards and pigsties constructed so that water run-off from roofs \u2013 and fruit dropped by bats \u2013 was directed into the pigsty. The result was that pigs were able to eat bat-saliva-contaminated fruit, became infected and then infected their handlers.",

For preventing, or at least slowing, the emergence of new diseases \u2013 and for more efficient response to outbreaks \u2013 we need to have a better understanding of these proximate determinants. One route to preventing recurrence of Nipah virus at pig farms would be to implement policies and regulations addressing the \u201cupstream\u201d land use changes that eventually led to emergence. A second, complementary route is through interventions affecting what Chua calls \u201cthe pattern of pig and orchard farming\u201d (Chua et al., 2002); that is, human activities at the local level. A first step in this approach is discerning those patterns. Having a model of proximate determinants facilitates this activity.",

There is a lively debate about the proximate determinants of prevalence, which may include animal biology, pathogen ecology, animal density, biodiversity and animal movement, among others (Keesing et al., 2010). On the human side of the model the probability of spillover transmission from animals is primarily affected by the likelihood of someone encountering an infected animal or its excreta, determined by the frequency with which people come in contact with specific types of animals that might carry infections and the type of contact they have with animals; that is, by the types of activities in which they engage.",

Wild animal meat purchased in markets is frequently more expensive than domestic animal meat; a market survey carried out by WCS and FHI360 in Laos (unpublished) showed that brush-tailed porcupine meat cost three times as much as domestic pork per kilogram. In addition, within-family dynamics can affect who gets exposed and with what frequency and intensity. As an example, family type \u2013 e.g. single parent, nuclear family or extended \u2013 will affect whether and how intensely children are socialized to hunting or what food allocation rules are practiced to determine who gets to eat what part of the animal (Whitehead, 2000).",

Various customs with regards to specific animals may serve different social functions that can shed light on other determinants of exposure. For instance, hunting some animals may confer certain social standing in the community and sharing the products of a hunt maybe used as a way of incurring favors (Gurven and von Rueden, 2006).

It is important to note that while increasing urbanization produces habitats unsuitable for many species of animals, urban-adapted wild animals can occur at higher densities in urban and peri-urban areas than in more rural areas (Bradley and Altizer, 2007).

As a first step, we chose to start this endeavor simply, by comparing groups distinguished by different social determinants of human activity involving animals, e.g., gender, age, ethnic norms, livelihood systems, settlement patterns. The study is designed to facilitate such comparisons, for example, of different population groups (e.g., two ethnicities) living in the same location, thus having similar access to animals, or the same group in locations where access to animals is likely to differ (e.g., one ethnic group living in different settings). In addition, the design includes separate samples of men and women to assess the effect of gender on exposure and provides for subsamples of children likely to have different frequencies or types of exposure than adults.

Other groups are encouraged to use the model as a basis for developing studies to explore the complex interaction of various social and environmental factors that result in disease emergence. Some of the questions to be explored might include: how does urbanization and exposure to \u201cinternational\u201d norms affect attitudes and patterns of consumption of different types of wildlife meat? What effects do various approaches to community-based natural resource management in different types of communities have on the frequency and type of interaction with domestic and wild animals? How do national policies regarding universal primary education and their implementation at the local level affect community and family expectations, their socialization of children and different family members' relation with domestic and wild animals?",

A cross-sectional survey of a large group of individuals such as reported here is appropriate for capturing an overall snapshot of the human-animal interface, including all the animal species people could come interact with as well as all the major activities and locations associated with interactions. Other approaches would be optimal for more focused studies targeting a specific group of animals (e.g. primates) or specific activities (e.g. hunting). For instance, exposure could be documented by intense observation of individuals over long periods of time or by asking people to keep diaries of specific activities such as hunting or eating. More in-depth qualitative or ethnographic studies can help tease out the social and cultural influences shaping specific types of interactions with animals. It is important, however, to remember that all these methods bring their own set of methodological and ethical challenges that would need to be carefully considered, similar to the process described in this paper for the cross-sectional study.",
