Initial cases of this disease were reported in Hubei providence of China in December 2019 [1] . The World Health Organization named this disease as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) in February 2020. The patients with this disease usually present with features of respiratory illness. Rarely they have acute coronary syndrome on arrival. Our patient presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as initial presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Covid-19 disease patient presenting with STEMI.",

Whenever a new infectious disease emerges, knowledge regarding clinical features, diagnostic tools, treatment options, and transmission dynamics is very critical. Patients with this disease, can transmit the virus even in asymptomatic phase. Most of the time, patients developed cardiovascular complications after the diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. Very rarely, patients presented with acute cardiovascular symptoms like our patient. Prior history of cardiovascular disease always poses poor outcomes with Covid-19 infection like any other respiratory infection. Studies have shown that Covid-19 infection can worsen existing cardiovascular problems or can precipitate new cardiovascular problems [3] .",

It can cause direct myocardial injury by altering angiotensin converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways as it binds to ACE2 receptors of myocardium and lung after entry into the human body [4, 5] . It can also cause systemic inflammation and cytokine storm which can cause multi organ failure including cardiovascular involvement [6, 7] . Hypoxia and respiratory failure pose a demand-supply mismatch causing myocardia injury. Prothrombotic state along with systemic infection causing shear stress from increased coronary flow can precipitate acute myocardial syndrome which is possibly the precipitating factor in our patient. Major electrolyte imbalances due to multiorgan failure and some drugs used for treatment of severe covid-19 infections have been shown to precipitate arrhythmias as well [8] .",

Studies from SARS outbreak in the past showed that viral ribonucleic acid was present in cardiomyocytes during autopsies of some patients indicating direct myocardial involvement of the virus [10] .

We should be vigilant of all the possible cardiovascular complications to diagnose them early and treat them in a timely manner.
