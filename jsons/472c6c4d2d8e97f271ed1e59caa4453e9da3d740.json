Surgical and Intensive care unit escalation , operative management involving first double lung transplant successfully performed by Dr. Chen Jinguy et al of the Wuxi People's Hospital utilizing ECMO and invasive mechanical ventilation, and medical therapies such as antiviral, corticosteroids , oncological drugs and immunity enhancing therapy proved very effective .",

Due to the limitation on pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is becoming a global concern . Autopsies are warranted and valuable for futuristic study and research .Although at the moment there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 . The best strategy to deal with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is to strictly implement controlling source of infection, protecting the susceptible people more especially the highly susceptible ( the aged) , wearing protective equipment , and cutting off the transmission. The global governing bodies in various countries must encourage people to stay at home; cancel or postpone public events or mass gatherings; shut down public institutions and public events. These control measures when effectively and accurately implemented, will control the epidemic effectively. Futuristic research and study will gear focus more on improving accuracy and precision in early diagnostic tests, developing vaccines and identifying effective drugs. Therefore elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for achieving such goals.",
