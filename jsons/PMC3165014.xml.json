SARS-CoV is a \u223c100 nm diameter, enveloped, single strand RNA virus containing a 30 kb genome with 14 open reading frames. SARS-CoV has four major structural proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [7]. The S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for virus binding and virus penetration. It is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity [8], [9].

            "text": "Previous SARS vaccine developments fall into several categories: inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccines [19], [20], [21], DNA or other recombinant viruses expressing the S spike glycoprotein [10], [11], [22], [47], subunit vaccines containing S receptor binding domain or soluble ectodomain [23], [24], [52] and virus like particles (VLPs) based vaccines. Of these, SARS-CoV VLP vaccine candidates have shown considerable promise [30], [31], [32], [48]. Recombinant VLP vaccine development has drawn increasing attention because it has the potential to be safer than inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines and to be more immunogenic than subunit or DNA vaccines [25], [49], [50]. Recently, recombinant influenza VLP vaccines have been reported to be well tolerated and immunogenic in human trials [51]. SARS S proteins have been incorporated into VLPs composed of either M and E, or M and N structural proteins, but were shown to be produced at low levels in mammalian cells [26], [27]. In a baculovirus insect cell expression system, the SARS S proteins were incorporated into secreted and intracellular VLPs composed of SARS M and E [28], [29], [30], [31], but with low yields. In an effort to address the low yields of SARS-CoV VLPs, chimeric VLPs containing the S from SARS-CoV and M, E, N from mouse hepatitis virus were produced and showed increased yields relative to wild type VLPs when expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, immunization with these VLPs reduced lung virus titer in a mouse challenged model [32]. Although, SARS VLPs formation and its immunogenicity were shown to be promising from these studies, the expression levels remained less than what would be needed for a viable commercial vaccine candidate.",

To construct a chimeric SARS S protein, the transmembrane and carboxyl terminus (TM/CT) of the SARS S protein (aa 1196-1255) were removed and replaced with the TM/CT from A/Indonesia/5/2005 HA (aa 531-568). Codon optimized DNA sequences of the SARS S protein, the chimeric S protein, and the M1 protein used for high level expression in insect cells were biochemically synthesized by Geneart AG (Regensburg, Germany). These coding sequences were individually cloned into BamHI and HindIII sites of pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pFastBac1-M1 was digested with SnaBI and PvuI. The 2571 bp fragment containing M1 coding sequence was gel purified. pFastBac1-S was digested with HpaI and PvuI. The 6870 bp fragment containing S coding sequence was gel purified. The 2571 bp and 6870 bp fragments were ligated together with T4 DNA ligase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). This process produced a tandem pFastBac1 plasmid that contained both the chimeric SARS S gene and the M1 gene with each gene under the control of its own polyhedrin promoter.",

No S, M or E protein bands were observed in the coomassie blue stained gel (data not shown). This was probably due to the lack of an efficient matrix core protein needed for VLPs formation. Influenza matrix protein M1, especially the M1 from avian influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) has been shown to support the production of high yield influenza VLPs even with hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from other heterologous influenza strains [34], [35]. As a result of those studies we decided to explore the possibility of forming a chimeric VLP containing the SARS S protein and the influenza M1 matrix protein. To maximize the interaction between the SARS S and the influenza M1, we replaced the wild type SARS S protein's transmembrane and carboxyl terminus (TM/CT) with the A/Indonesia/5/2005 influenza virus hemagglutinin TM/CT, and constructed a tandem transfer vector for chimeric S/M1 VLP production as shown in Fig. 1A.",

These two proteins have been detected previously in some of the influenza VLPs we have produced in insect cells. Tubulin is likely to reside inside of VLPs since it may work together with actin to facilitate the baculovirus or VLPs transition to cell surface [53].

All VLP groups and S + alum groups did not show any sign of weight loss (Fig. 3C) and the lung virus titers, at 3 days post challenge, appeared to correlate with the survival data (Fig. 3D): without adjuvant, 0.8 \u03bcg of the SARS S protein failed to significantly reduce lung virus titer, 4 \u03bcg of the SARS S protein reduced virus titer 2.5 log, 0.8 \u03bcg of the SARS VLPs reduced virus titer 6 logs, and 4 \u03bcg of the SARS VLPs reduced virus titer below the detectable limit. Likewise, in all groups containing SARS S protein with alum, lung virus titers were reduced below the detectable limit. This data indicated that as low as 0.8 \u03bcg of IM administered SARS VLP vaccine, without adjuvant, can fully protect mice from death and weight loss from a lethal virus challenge. IM administered SARS S protein vaccine can fully protect mice but only when co-administered with an alum adjuvant.",

Whereas, all mice immunized with 0.8 \u03bcg and 4 \u03bcg of the SARS VLPs survived virus challenge (Fig. 4A and B). The net weight loss for both of the VLP vaccine groups was as high as 3\u20134% but the animals completely recovered (Fig. 4C). Also, the SARS S protein failed to reduce lung virus titer. In the 0.8 \u03bcg and 4 \u03bcg VLP vaccine groups, lung virus titer were reduced 1 and 3.5 logs, respectively (Fig. 4D). The data show that without an effective adjuvant, the SARS S protein failed to protect when administered IN. The IN VLP vaccine without adjuvant protected 100% of mice from death, similar to when the vaccine is given IM. However, the lung virus titers in the IN VLP vaccine groups were 4 logs higher than the corresponding IM groups and the IN immunized animals suffered minor weight loss. The data from IM and IN lethal challenge studies indicate that the SARS S protein vaccine requires an effective adjuvant to be protective. For both vaccines, the IM route of administration worked better than IN for reducing lung virus titer. One possible explanation is that local immunity was mainly induced in the upper respiratory tract during IN immunization and not in the lower respiratory tract where the SARS-CoV replicates [41], [42], [43], [44] and where immunity was not fully established at the time of challenge. Whereas, after IM immunization, a broader systemic humoral immunity was developed that offer a better protection against SARS-CoV challenge through out the respiratory tract. IM immunization may also induce higher neutralizing antibody titers to help reduce lung virus titers.",

Mice were bled on days 21 and 42, and the sera samples were assayed for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV (Fig. 5\n). Both the SARS S protein and the SARS VLPs need two vaccinations to elicit any neutralizing antibody titers > 250. The SARS S vaccine required alum adjuvant to induce neutralizing antibody titers above the base line, whereas 0.8 \u03bcg and 4 \u03bcg VLPs vaccine without alum can induce neutralizing antibody titer up to 878 and 1525, respectively. This result directly correlated with the survival rate and post challenge lung virus titer as shown in Fig. 3. The SARS S vaccine with alum and the SARS VLPs vaccine groups had neutralizing antibody geometry mean titer ranging from 878 to 2550, and they were not statistically different from each other. S with alum groups showed a trend of higher neutralizing antibody titer at day 42 than VLPs with alum. One explanation may be that S protein can absorb to alum more efficiently than VLPs, and the slow release of S from alum results a prolonged elevated antibody response at day 42.",

We obtained the level of 1 mg (S content) SARS VLPs per liter of Sf9 cell culture in shake flask. Upon further cell culture optimization such as stir tank reactor, high cell density, fed-batch or medium exchange and purification development, such yield is expected to increase several fold or more. We studied the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the SARS S protein vaccine and the SARS VLP vaccine in a mice lethal challenge model. The VLP vaccine, without adjuvant, protected 100% of the immunized mice from death when given IM, reduced lung virus titer to undetectable levels, and elicited serum neutralizing antibody titer up to 1500. On the other hand, the S protein vaccine required alum adjuvant to effectively protect mice from lethal challenge, reduce lung virus titers, and elicit neutralizing antibodies. The data suggest that both the SARS S vaccine with alum and the SARS VLP vaccine are good candidates for protection against SARS-CoV infections when administered IM.",

            "text": "The recombinant VLP vaccines have been an attractive approach for vaccine development for the past decade. VLPs do not contain the viral genome, therefore cannot replicate in humans or revert to a pathogenic form. These characteristics make VLPs a safer vaccine for the recipient, and also a safer vaccine to manufacturing than inactivated or live attenuated viral vaccines, especially for a dangerous virus such as SARS-CoV that can cause high morbidity and death [25]. The repetitive antigen pattern represented on the surface of VLPs make them easier to be recognized by antigen presenting cells than subunit vaccines and therefore are able to induce a stronger and broader humoral and cellular immune response [34], [35], [39]. There are only three VLP vaccines approved for human use, the Hepatitis B vaccine and the two HPV vaccines. All three are composed of single protein particles without a lipid bilayer envelope. In addition, one of the commercial HPV vaccines (Cervarix) is produced in the baculovirus insect cell expression system [25]. The more complex version of VLPs, such as influenza VLPs that contain hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, M1 proteins, and a lipid bilayer envelope, are currently being evaluated in phase II human clinical trials by Novavax Inc. No other VLP vaccine is approved or in the late stage of clinical development, partially because VLPs are usually difficult to produce in high level due to the lack of an efficient viral core protein. In this report, we showed that influenza matrix M1 protein has the potential to become a universal core protein to support VLPs production for other viruses. It is not a coincidence that M1 can form VLPs with the SARS S protein. SARS-CoV and influenza virus share many common features: both have a RNA genome; both are 100\u2013200 nm diameter spherical particles; both have a major surface spike glycoprotein (S or HA) that form trimers, and both spike glycoproteins contain a globular head domain and a stem region. The replacement of the SARS S TM/CT with the HA TM/CT may help to maximize the native interaction between core protein and surface antigen, and promote VLPs formation and secretion. The use of the influenza M1 as a core protein to form VLPs for other viruses is a promising approach that can be explored in the future. Besides of the potential yield increase, influenza M1 containing chimeric VLPs can quickly activated M1 specific memory CD4 T cells since most human population were infected multiple times with influenza virus during their lifetime. Activated M1 specific CD4 T cells can stimulate SARS S or other antigen specific B cells for differentiation and antibody secretion.",

In the unfortunate case of another SARS pandemic, countries or regions with existing influenza VLP vaccine manufacturing capacity will have the ability to quickly switch to the SARS vaccine production in the same facility, just like switching to another seasonal flu strain.

Mice were bled on day 21 (grey bar) and 42 (black bar). Sera samples were 2 fold serially diluted and assayed for neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the inverse of the greatest dilution of serum that neutralized 100% and had no visible virus CPE. Results are expressed as the geometric mean titer \u00b1 SEM. A 1:20 dilution was the lowest dilution of serum tested.
