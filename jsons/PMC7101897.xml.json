While this form of immunodeficiency is not usually associated with any specific symptoms, patients with IgA deficiency present with an increased frequency of allergies, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The high susceptibility to infection observed among these patients is almost always associated with a concomitant IgG2 deficiency. A number of autoimmune disorders have been reported to be associated with IgA deficiency, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [2], rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease [3].

Chest X-rays revealed bilateral, diffuse alveolar, and interstitial infiltrates. His oxygen index (OI) was 54. A diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus was made on the basis of the chest X-ray findings, the low OI value, and the elevated influenza A/H1N1 virus titers. He required artificial pulmonary ventilation and was treated with hypothermia and positional drainage.

A renal biopsy was performed, revealing diffuse global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. No mesangial cell proliferation or increase in the mesangial matrix was found. Immunofluorescence staining revealed diffuse granular deposits of IgG and C3 in the glomerular capillary wall. Electron microscopy detected extensive global subepithelial deposition of electron-dense material with spike formations. The pathological diagnosis was diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). Immunological laboratory findings included a serum IgA level of <2 mg/dl, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 levels of 1,130 (normal range 320\u2013748), 14 (208\u2013754), 97.8 (6.6\u201388), and 5 (4\u2013105) mg/dl, respectively, and an IgM level of 376 (35\u2013220) mg/dl. Serum complement levels were normal, and the anti-DNA antibody (ANA) titer was negative. The patient was diagnosed with MGN and IgA\u2013IgG2 deficiency. There was no familial history of immunodeficiency. MPT and PDN were given and he once again went into remission. The PDN dose was gradually tapered and eventually discontinued.\n",

Immune deficiency may also potentiate the virulence of an external vector and lead to an occult or latent chronic viral infection. Alternatively, host antigens may be altered and subsequently participate in its pathogenesis [10]. In our case, immunosuppressive drugs, including MPT and PDN, were given to inhibit the activation of SLE. Our patient experienced many infections, including acute pneumonia and parotitis, due to his immunodeficiency. He also had a low serum total IgG level and developed CVID. Thus, in terms of the pathogenesis of CVID in our patient, we speculate that immune dysregulation in our immunodeficient patient was triggered by the numerous episodes of infection.",
