It is a medical emergency characterized by a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognitive function, developed over a short period of time [1, 2]. Although delirium can also develop in children and younger adults, its prevalence is much higher in older people. Several studies have reported that up to one third of patients over 70 years of age admitted to any medical unit develop delirium [2], a percentage that increases up to 50% in surgical units and up to 85% in palliative care units [3]. The importance of delirium is not only due to its high incidence, but also on the serious consequences for those who suffer it. It has a negative impact on quality of life, increasing morbidity, functional dependence [4, 5], the risk of institutionalization [6] and mortality [6\u20139]. Moreover, delirium has been associated with longer hospital stays [10] and higher economic costs [11]. The association with all these negative results has been shown independent of possible confusing variables such as age, sex, comorbidities or severity of illnesses and dementia.",

Regarding the care of disabling acute or chronic conditions, physical therapy and rehabilitation are a pivotal part of the multidisciplinary and multifactorial approach. In contrast, despite scientific evidence that supports it, the benefit of physical exercise on cognition is less known. Available literature demonstrates not only that physical activity is correlated to a better cognitive function and to a reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment [17, 18], but also that the performance of physical exercise or rehabilitation can improve cognitive function in older population [19, 20], even in persons with preexisting dementia [21].",

Then, we have reviewed intervention studies, centered on multicomponent interventions, including rehabilitation, which have shown to be effective in managing delirium. For this purpose, we did a search in PubMed Database using a combination of terms representing delirium prevention, multicomponent intervention, non-pharmacologic intervention, and Hospital Elder Life Program. Studies were included if they were randomized control trials and mean age of subject was \u2265 65 years. We excluded those articles which intervention did not incorporate physical strategies. The initial search yielded 57 articles published between January 1999 and June 2019. After exclusions, we only selected 10 original articles in the review. Finally, we have examined how frailty, delirium and physical exercise interact with each other.",

For example, strokes affecting specific structures can just cause delirium [28]. Interestingly, these areas are also part of the complex control of gait pathways, which includes brainstem, cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and cortical regions such as the supplementary motor area, motor and premotor cortex, parietal and visual cortex [29]. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex is involved in the planning and control of movements [30], while is also considered as a key region for attention [31], one of the main cognitive functions altered in delirium. Since attention is one of the cognitive features necessary for a safety walking, disturbances in this area can be directly correlated with motor function disorders and falls [32]. It is important to note that for a safe and effective gait, in addition to good sensorimotor systems, a correct integration between executive, cognitive and affective dimensions is essential [32].",

Since reductions in acetylcholine concentration have been also associated to frontal and executive dysfunctions [34], it has been hypothesized that motor disturbances as the manifestations of delirium may be caused by the inability to plan and perform movements, due to this neurotransmitter dysregulation [35].(b)Physical exercise and cognitive function",

At a molecular level, exercise produces changes in molecular growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a crucial role in neuroplasticity and neuroprotection, and increases the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), involved in both neurogenesis and angiogenesis [43].

Every motor subtype has his own associated risk factors and consequences. The evidence suggests that patients with more disability are at higher risk of an hypoactive delirium, which is independently associated with higher a mortality [68\u201370] and a higher global functional decline compared to mixed and hyperactive delirium [70].",

In a systematic review by Sillner et al. [71], on one hand, delirium is a persistent risk factor for falls with an relative risk that ranges from 1.4 to 12.6. On the other hand, delirium is also frequent (24\u201396%) in patients that have fallen. Motor disturbances, in addition to the impaired attention linked to delirium, are factors contributing to falls. Disturbances of attention (which is the key in the control of gait and posture, especially under challenging circumstances [72]) contribute to reduce the ability to maintain gait with multiple environmental stimuli, increasing automatically the risk of falling. Furthermore, other delirium symptoms such as disorientation and alteration in perception, together with motor disturbances, create an environment favorable to falls. In fact, there is evidence demonstrating that preventing delirium prevents falls [73].(c)Functional impairment and disability as consequences of delirium",

Despite the evidence of worse functional recovery related to delirium is overwhelming at discharge and in the first months after delirium [76\u201378], the functional consequences of delirium beyond 12 months are less known and even sometimes contradictory. Some publications consider physical function after 6\u201312 months to be comparable in patients who did and did not develop delirium [5, 76, 79], while other studies point to a maintenance of the functional loss during more than 12 months after delirium [80].

This condition implies, in the person suffering from it, a state of increased vulnerability associated with many negative health-related outcomes, including an increase in morbidity, mortality and disability [104]. A classic definition of frailty is centered on a reduction of physical performance (low gait speed, low strength, reduced physical activity and exhaustion,) and malnutrition. To detect it, both specific frailty scales, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale (CSF), specific Frailty Index or the Fried\u2019s frailty phenotype, can be used, as well as physical function test such as the Short-Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) or the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) [105, 106]. Frailty represents a critical moment in older adults, leading to a progressive decrease in global capacity. In fact, to prevent disability during aging is essential to recognize and manage frailty in the community [107, 108].",

Although delirium is catalogued as a neurocognitive disorder, we believe that scientific evidence shows that it is also a motor disorder, which is to be expected, since a vast body of literature already supports an interaction between motor and cognitive function. This motor component of delirium should be take into account when designing interventions or strategies to address delirium. Since motor function evolves, we have to be able to intervene in each of the critical moments, from primary care, during hospital stay and after discharge. This interventions may have a special importance in frail older adults. We cannot forget that delirium etiology is multifactorial and that interventions to diminish their risk must also be multicomponent, including, of course, rehabilitation strategies with the indispensable competence of a rehabilitation team that will increase the probability of success.",
