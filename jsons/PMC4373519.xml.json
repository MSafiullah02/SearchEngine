Indeed, several studies have suggested that sTREM-1 is valuable for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis [16,17] before a positive result of CSF culture. These data show the individual predictive value of these two biomarkers. Combination of several biomarkers can improve diagnostic value in various diseases or conditions: such as sepsis [19], liver fibrosis [20], community-acquired pneumonia [21] and severe malaria [22].

In addition, DcR3 may have pro-inflammatory functions [26,27]. In ARDS patients, higher plasma DcR3 levels are associated with multiple-organ dysfunction, longer duration of ICU stay and ventilator dependence. Serum DcR3 levels in non-survivors are higher than those in survivors regardless of the APACHE II scores. Therefore, DcR3 appears to possess the potential to serve as both a diagnostic and a prognostic marker of ARDS [28]. Moreover, levels of DcR3 are elevated in patients with sepsis and it may act as a clinically important biomarker of sepsis. DcR3 might be considered as a double-edged sword in sepsis and have the potential to be a novel target for the treatment of sepsis [10,12]. Our previous study has showed that detection of CSF DcR3 is useful for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. A cut-off point of 0.201 ng/mL is established, which has a sensitivity of 78.75% and a specificity of 81.40% [13]. Thus, similar to sepsis, DcR3 might turn out to be a novel target of bacterial meningitis. Further studies are needed to determine the confirmatory role of abnormally high level of DcR3 in CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis.",

Moreover, the study doesn\u2019t have the limit of WBC count [17]. Another important explanation might be technical.

The OR of biscore was 7.007. The same as other disorders or diseases, such as sepsis and severe malaria [19,22], the higher the score was recorded, the greater the possibility of being infected by bacteria was determined. Bioscore 2 could yield 95.65% of patients with bacterial meningitis. With at least one of the two biomarkers higher than the critical point (bioscore \u22651), about 86% of patients were found to be infected by bacteria. Nonetheless, with a bioscore of 0, 28.89% of patients could not be excluded. In addition, because serum of patients in this study were not collected, predictive value of combined bioscore in blood for bacterial meningitis was not determined. Further studies are required to validate the potential value of combined bioscore in serum for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.",
