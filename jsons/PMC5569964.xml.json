In a randomized, population-based cross-sectional study of risk perceptions and knowledge, we found low levels of risk literacy and poor preparedness practices among the general public. The most commonly perceived potential hazards were infectious disease outbreak, typhoon and fire. Few respondents had prepared the necessary actions or materials for disaster, including completion of first aid training and stockpiling of non-perishable food and water, but most reported supplies of basic household medical supplies. Individuals with chronic health issues were more likely to have a long-term supply of medication available. Further public health strategies are needed to inform the population of likely hazards (such as extreme temperature events) and how they can best prepare for emergencies.",

Preparedness is defined by United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)2 as knowledge, capabilities and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals \u2018\u2018to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions\u2019\u2019. Preparedness efforts range from individual level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (setting up early warning systems and contingency plans, the development of evacuation routes, and public information dissemination).",

Hong Kong, an Asian urban, high-density community, may therefore act as a starting point for understanding community disaster health risk literacy and preparedness in Asia. Such knowledge is necessary to inform policy makers and emergency responders of the baseline level of preparedness in order to create effective policies and contingency plans. This study examines the profile and predictors of community disaster risk perception, awareness and household-based preparedness using a randomized cross-sectional population-based household telephone survey.

Individual disaster preparedness was defined by having received first aid training while a proxy variable for household preparedness was calculated by summating the five variables of owning a first aid kit, having basic aids supplies, storing emergency food and water, having extra supplies of basic medication, and possessing a fire extinguisher. Univariate analysis was conducted, to identify significant independent socio-demographic variables with the disaster-related risk perceptions and disaster preparedness. Forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression was then applied on variables with at least a marginal statistical significance of p<0.05 in the univariate analysis in order to identify socio-demographic predictors for perceived susceptibility to disaster as well as actual level of disaster preparedness.

Among all respondents, only 26.1% (n=261) reported having ever received some form of first aid training. For household-based preparedness, basic supplies such as face-masks, band-aids and basic medication such as anti-pyretic drugs were reported available in over 90% of interviewed households. In contrast, ownership of a first aid kit (49.4%, n=494) and non-perishable food and drinking water (57.4%, n=574) were less commonly reported. Among those reported to be chronic disease patients, 89% (n=189) had prepared long-term medications at home that could support their chronic illness for at least two weeks. In addition, although fire hazard was perceived as the most threatening disaster in Hong Kong, only 11.5% (n=114) of the respondents possessed fire extinguisher in the household. Overall, 75.1% (n=753) of the respondents were practicing at least three out of the five preparedness measures (equipped with a first aid kit, basic aids supplies, emergency food and drinking water, basic medication, and a fire extinguisher).",

An Australian study by Cretikos et al. found similar results when investigating household disaster preparedness and information sources used before and during a disaster in New South Wales27. The affected community was poorly prepared, as less than one-fifth of the households had all items required for preparedness: a torch, battery operated radio, appropriate batteries, mobile phone, emergency contact list and first aid kit.27 Another study conducted by Bethel et. al. yielded similar results in the United States.28 Only 42.4% of households had all four preparedness items, which included three-day supply of drinking water and nonperishable food, a battery-operated radio with working batteries, and a flashlight with working batteries28. Their multivariate analysis indicated that respondents with poorer reported health status, disabilities, and multiple chronic diseases were less likely to prepare emergency supplies, yet they were more likely to be equipped with a three-day supply of medication28, which partly echoes our results that people with chronic diseases were more likely to be prepared with adequate long-term medication.",

A similar trend was observed among those with secondary education or above, although such observations were not found to be statistically significant. One possible explanation for such trend may be that people with higher education are more conscious about disaster-related news and information globally. Muttarak conducted a survey among areas receiving tsunami warnings after the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake in Thailand, and found that formal education can increase disaster preparedness and reduce vulnerability to natural hazards35. Also, higher education were correlated with better emergency supplies in studies done by Schultz36 and Eisenmen et al37, though no association was found between education level and the actual household preparedness in this study, possibly due to study limitations.",

Further studies in Chinese communities will be worthwhile to explore the gap between perceived and real vulnerabilities, actual preparedness practices, and potential areas for strengthening health education.",

Second, a self-reported questionnaire was used to determine household preparedness, which may differ from observed measures of behaviors. Third, our findings may represent under-reported rates of preparedness because respondents might not have recognized the term \u201cdisaster kit\u201d or \u201cemergency kit\u201d as used in the interview.",
