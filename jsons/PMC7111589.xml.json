            "text": "Dynamic plasma membrane remodeling is a vital part of various cell biological processes and is achieved by the interplay between the plasma membrane and the underlying actomyosin network mediated by protein adapters [1]. Talin and vinculin, both as adapter proteins for the dynamic interaction between the transmembrane receptor integrin and actin cytoskeleton, play important roles, in particular in transmitting mechanosignals to regulate cell structure and function [2\u20135]. Talin is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein, predominantly detected at regions of cell\u2013substratum or cell\u2013cell adhesions [2\u20134]. Talin functions as an adapter for integrin in forming mechanosensitive intercellular or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) tensions, generating cell\u2013cell junctions or focal adhesions between cell and ECM, respectively [6\u20138]. Via the dynamic correlation with its binding partner, vinculin, talin has been documented to participate in establishing bacterial infections via its role as the adapter to mediate the cytoskeleton-driven dynamics of the plasma membrane [5, 9\u201312]. Bacteria have been shown to directly manipulate host subcellular actin-mediated pulling force to promote intercellular spread [5, 13, 14], including the spotted fever group (SFG) of Rickettsia (R.) spp [12]. To promote cell\u2013cell spread, R. parkeri secrets surface cell antigen 4 to interact with vinculin and block the association between vinculin and another binding partner, \u03b1-catenin, reducing vinculin-dependent mechanotransduction at cell\u2013cell junctions [5]. Therefore, SFGRs have evolved a strategy to target vinculin-based host cytoskeletal force generation to enable spread. However, little is known regarding the potential role of the complex of talin\u2013vinculin during SFG rickettsioses (SFGR) infections.",

            "text": "Many functional properties of a protein are determined by participation in protein\u2013protein complexes, in a temporal and/or spatial manner [15\u201317]. Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) include highly specific physical contacts/linkages between two or more protein molecules. In a specific biomolecular context, physical contacts are established spatially between special chains of protein molecules [18\u201320]. Technologically, the association between proteins can be clarified by immunoprecipitation, which is performed coupling with western blot (WB) to test target proteins, requiring homogenization of sample and resulting in losing spatial information about the targets, both at intra- and intercellular levels [21]. Colocalization of different proteins with fluorescence microscopy is frequently used to assess their potential association in situ. However, colocalization under epifluorescent/confocal fluorescent microscope does not necessarily mean a physical interaction [7]. A practical step toward unraveling the complex molecular relationship, temporal and spatial, of protein-to-protein physical interaction is essential for accomplishing a comprehensive knowledge of the functional outcomes of a PPI [8]. The concept of spatial proximity between two protein targets is merging to be a practical approach for endogenous quantitative detection of spatial proximal complex of proteins at the single molecule level in fixed cells and tissue samples. Currently, in situ application of proximity ligation assay (PLA) is used to visualize the spatial proximal signals of two protein targets in tissue samples [22, 23], directly examining proximal interaction between the proteins, in responses to different stimuli [24]. However, the commercially available PLA assay (Sigma Aldrich) restricted the use of primary antibody raised in mouse on murine samples due to the antibody incompatibility between the kit and the sample. Furthermore, traditional histological fixatives (e.g., formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde) cause strong chemical crosslinking of proteins, which impede detection of many sensitive antigens [25\u201327]. Our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were collected during experiments requiring high biocontainment, for which multiple 10% formalin fixation steps are mandatory, leading to heavy antigen masking. The technical guideline for antigen retrieval for PLA assay, as provided in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or publications [22\u201324], resulted in an ineffective antigen retrieval on our archival FFPE tissue samples collected from the experiments requiring high biocontainment.",

Taking advantage of established mouse models of SFGR infections [28\u201330], we examined the spatial proximal complex of talin\u2013vinculin in mouse liver tissues. During lethal SFGR infections, significant bacterial loads are detected in liver tissues coupled with various pathological manifestations making it ideal to study this interaction [31, 32]. We observed, compared with mock infection, increased talin\u2013vinculin spatial proximities (TVSPs) in liver in response to lethal R. australis infection. Interestingly, retrospective studies showed that similar increased TVSPs in liver in response to lethal Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in mouse. Given that the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1) plays critical role during SFGR infections [30], using EPAC1-knockout (KO) mice, we further found that deletion of EPAC1 could suppress TVSPs in mice infected with 2 LD50 of R. australis. These findings may help to delineate a fresh insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis targeting the liver during SFGR and EBOV infections.",

Therefore, we developed the PLA result of TVSPs in HUVECs as a signal positive control. For reagent negative control, mouse normal IgG and rabbit normal IgG were used as the primary antibodies. In Fig. 1, red dot signals from the TVSPs were visualized under fluorescent microscope only in signal positive controls (Fig. 1a\u2013c), but not in the reagent negative controls (Fig. 1e). Xie and Perrino [37] reported improper antibody dilution and insufficient washing between steps during staining can lead to false positives. In addition to routine standard rinse procedures between incubations (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d), we performed antibody titration assay for optimal working concentrations (Fig. 1). Based upon titration of the primary antibodies (Fig. 1a\u2013c), we used 1:500 as working dilutions for the mouse anti-talin and rabbit anti-vinculin antibodies in PLAs (Fig. 1b). vWF, recognized as an EC marker, is synthesized and stored in a storage granule called as Weibel\u2013Palade body (WPB) in the endothelial cytosol [38, 39]. Our IF staining visualized that vWF was present in rod-shaped cytoplasmic WPBs (Fig. 1f). Rab5 is a cytosolic protein and localizes to early endosomes, and the complex of host Rab5 and vinculin is required for bacterial entry [9]. Our IF staining visualized that Rab5 was also present in the cytosol (Fig. 1g). As expected from a signal negative control, we did not detect potential PLA signals in HUVECs (Fig. 1d) and tissue (Fig. 1h) when using mouse anti-Rab5 and rabbit anti-vWF during the PLA although they both located in the cytosol.",

PLA assay coupling fluorescent phalloidin staining found no significant difference in colocalization of TVSP and filamentous actin signals in livers between WT-mock and lethal WT-R. australis mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A1-2, B1-2, C1-2).

            "text": "Talin, one of the most abundant components in cells, is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein concentrated at regions of cell\u2013substratum contact in cellular environments [2\u20134]. It is a long rod-like protein, one end of which contains an integrin binding site, while the other end contains an actin-binding domain. At rest, Rap1-GTP-interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) binds to the closed R3 domain of talin and anchors it to the cell membrane. When actin filaments are pulled, the R3 domain will undergo a conformational change, which causes RIAM to dissociate and vinculin to bind [7, 41]. Talin is a mechanosensitive molecule and this mechanosensitivity relates to the interaction of talin with vinculin [42, 43]. Vinculin is a major talin-binding partner that facilitates crosstalk between talin and actin through its talin-binding head domain (V-head) and its actin-binding tail domain (V-tail) [44, 45]. Vinculin is also a central component of mechanosensitive adhesive complexes that forms between cells and the ECM [8]. The force-dependent interaction between talin and vinculin plays a crucial role in the initiation and growth of focal adhesions [6, 7]. Given identification of a talin-binding site localized within the N-terminal vinculin head domain [44, 45] and characterization of the functional role of talin\u2013vinculin interplay to regulate actin-based cell membrane dynamics in response to mechanosignals [7, 41], it is important to delineate the mechanism(s) targeting talin\u2013vinculin interaction, in particular their dynamic spatial proximity, in pathophysiological context. Evidence from developmental studies suggests a high level of spatial proximity between talin and vinculin in response to mechnosignals [46]. Nevertheless, the potential role of the dynamics of TVSP during inflammation and infections remains completely unknown.",

            "text": "Host cytoskeleton plays a key role in many stages of infection and inflammation [47\u201349]. Due to its role as a filter, the liver is exposed to many systemic infectious pathogens. These pathogens may directly or indirectly affect the liver depending on the characteristics of the pathogens [50]. Liver inflammation due to various etiologies can result in liver fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis and carcinogenesis [51]. Vinculin participates in enhancing bacterial infection and the inflammatory response through underpinning integrin, which binds to ECM proteins, many bacterial pathogens and viruses [9\u201312]. Besides this, talin and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during viral infection [48]. However, whether talin or vinculin are involved in the pathophysiological processes in the liver during systemic infections is not yet clear. EBOV, a member of the family Filoviridae, is a major human pathogen and causes severe EBOV disease in humans and non-human primates with case-fatality rates in humans of up to 90% [52\u201356]. On July 17, 2019, WHO declared global health emergency as the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49025298). Rickettsioses represent devastating human infections [57]. Untreated or misdiagnosed SFGR infections are frequently associated with severe morbidity and mortality [58\u201362]. It has been forecasted that increased ambient temperature under conditions of global climate change is a driver in rickettsial epidemiology, leading to more widespread distribution of rickettsioses [63]. The intracellular pathogen Rickettsia manipulates intercellular tension via a secreted effector protein to promote engulfment of protrusions and cell-to-cell spread [5]. Whether these interacting proteins, talin and vinculin, play a role in the progress of these deadly infectious diseases still needs further exploration. In order to explore the TVSP in liver during these dread diseases, we chose to utilize our archival sample from Ebola and SFGR infected mice. This is the first report of enhanced TVSP in liver during systemic infections with SFGR and EBOV. The PLA fluorescence displayed higher intensity in infected tissues than that in normal tissues, in a manner dependent of EPAC1.",

            "text": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important molecular switch that translates environmental signals into regulatory effects in cells [64]. As such, a number of microbial pathogens have evolved a set of diverse virulence-enhancing strategies that exploit the cAMP signaling pathways of their hosts [65]. In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the effects of cAMP are transduced by two ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptors, the classic cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the more recently discovered exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) [66]. To date, two isoforms, EPAC1 and EPAC2, have been identified in humans. They are produced by independent genes, and predominantly expressed in different cell types, but both act on the same immediate downstream effectors [67, 68]. EPAC proteins function by responding to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activating the immediate downstream effectors, the Ras superfamily small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2. We have been interested in host cAMP signaling pathways, EPAC1 in particular, for their possible roles in rickettsial adhesion and invasion. We performed in vivo analyses using EPAC1-KO mouse [69] and EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs). We found that the deletion of the EPAC1 gene protected mice from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsiae (2 \u00d7 106 PFU of R. australis) [30]. Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 by ESI09, an ESI, in mice [70] mimicked the EPAC1-KO phenotype. ESI09 treatment dramatically decreased the morbidity and mortality associated with fatal spotted fever rickettsioses [30]. In addition, in vitro investigations demonstrated that EPAC1 inhibition suppressed rickettsial adherence to and invasion into ECs. However, aside from what we have shown, little is known regarding the precise mechanism underlying the role of EPAC1 in fatal rickettsioses. Observations from the present study provide a fresh insight into the mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of SFGR infections, regarding the potential role of the spatial proximal complex of talin\u2013vinculin. For instance, cytokines were documented to regulate talin-relevant [71] and vinculin-relevant [72] cytoskeletal dynamics in cells. \u201cCytokine storm\u201d has been well known as central host responses during SFGR [32] or EBOV [54\u201358] infections. We do not know the increased TVSP induced by infection itself or a form of outcome from host cytokine response, which will be investigated in future studies.",

            "text": "PPIs regulate a variety of cellular functions, which are central to understanding the functional relationships between proteins [71]. PPIs have been studied from different perspectives: biochemistry, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and signal transduction, among others [72, 73], and a multitude of methods have been applied to detect the PPIs [20]. The most conventional methods are yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry [74]. However, these approaches have a common limitation that all work on cells or tissue homogenates, thus missing critical compartmental information in cell biology or histology. Moreover, these methods have their own disadvantages, respectively, limiting wider applications accurately. The main criticism of the yeast two-hybrid screen of PPIs is the possibility of a high number of false-positive (and false-negative) identifications [75]. This partly clarifies the overlap, often found very minimal, in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems [76\u201378]. In addition, the colocalization of proteins can be clarified by immunoprecipitation, which is performed with beads to isolate proteins, followed by WB to test target proteins [79]; fluorescence colocalization microscopy is frequently used to assess potential links between distinct molecules; however, this method can lead to striking false-positive results and erroneous conclusions [80, 81]. Furthermore, colocalization does not necessarily mean a physical interaction [80]. A practical step toward unraveling the complex molecular relationship, temporal and spatial, of protein-to-protein physical interaction is essential for accomplishing a comprehensive knowledge of the functional outcomes [82]. Since detection of protein\u2013protein proximity has been developed to probe the proximal PPI in native environment [16, 83, 84], PLA is being more and more widely used in tissues and cells [22, 23]. In a typical PLA experiment, two antibodies are used to recognize two proteins of interest. Each antibody is conjugated to a short sequence of oligonucleotides that are complementary to each other. When these probes are in the proximity of less than 40 nm, the addition of two connector oligonucleotides that hybridize with the probes will lead to the formation of a closed circle template in the presence of a ligase [24, 83]. It can probe spatial proximity of endogenous proteins directly in individual cells and tissues to reveal the cellular and molecular architecture and its responses to perturbations [24].",

            "text": "However, a major factor limiting wide applications of PLA is the high cost for commercial kits. Furthermore, the currently commercially available secondary antibodies conjugated to the PLA probes can only bind to rabbit, mouse, or goat IgG. Hence, whether a PLA experiment can be performed depends on the availability of the primary antibodies that are from two of the above sources. For mouse samples, employing non-mouse original primary antibody was the technical principle from the manufacture of the PLA kit (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/duolink-troubleshooting-guide.html), consequently causing additional cost for purchasing other primary antibodies and probe marker kits that were used to conjugate the primary antibodies to the PLA probes. Mouse antibodies are the most widely used primary antibodies and very popular for routine assays (WB, ELISA, IP, IHC, and IF). Combining the results of PLA with one of these routine assays could provide more robust information, especially if identical primary antibodies are employed in these assays, suggesting the importance of developing strategies to perform PLA on mouse samples using primary antibodies raised in mouse. In this study, the infected samples were all of mouse origin. Through setting up a practical and scientific strategy, we explored the feasibility of using primary antibodies from sample species in PLA. Outcomes from this mouse-on-mouse PLA exhibited promising signal intensities and clean backgrounds. This means, the host species of primary antibodies using for PLA were not restricted by the species of the model. In addition, taking advantage of fluorescent-laser capture microdissection, we can extend the applications of PLA in biological/biomolecular science research.",

Many pathogens that threaten human health, including rickettsia ssp, coronaviruses like SARS and SARS-Cov-2, and filoviruses like Ebola, require high-containment BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories. Many of these pathogens are also select agents, a designation that requires extra steps to ensure proper sample inactivation. Assays like PLA are performed at BSL2, thereby requiring sample inactivation prior to removal from the BSL3 or 4. Inactivation typically requires long periods in and multiple changes of fixative, leading to possible overfixation, which is not ideal for the preservation of features in tissues. Here, we show that PLA is achievable even in these less-than-ideal fixation conditions.",

The observation window was out of our primary scope and we had limited access to more samples at similar time p.i.s. However, this information raised several questions: is there a correlation between TVSP and the activation of actin filamentation? Is TVSP a potential actin-cytoskeleton-mediated healing mechanism or pathogenic as it is found in surviving mice of both infections? Is TVSP possibly protective during hepatic healing from infections? These questions will be delineated in future studies.",
