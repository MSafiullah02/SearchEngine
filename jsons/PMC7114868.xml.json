Generally, SARS patients were accommodated in negative pressure isolation rooms on the ward. When these patients required operative procedures, a negative pressure theatre was considered to be more suitable than a positive pressure environment. In principle, a positive pressure operating theatre with adequate air changes could quickly eliminate the virus from the environment, and it has been shown that the risk of cross-contamination from airborne infection is low if staff are adequately protected with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).1 However, a negative pressure operating theatre offers optimal protection to personnel working in adjacent areas.",

Over a short period, one of the 11 operating theatres in the main operating suite of the hospital was converted temporarily into a negative pressure theatre. This was achieved by incorporating two strong exhaust fans next to the original exhaust system. The pressure differential was maintained by sealing the entrance doors with disposable sticky tape after the patient was transported into the room. This temporary negative pressure theatre worked well during the SARS crisis.2 Afterwards, the hospital management decided that a permanent negative pressure operating theatre was necessary, in anticipation of SARS returning and for those patients contracting similar infectious airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and severe influenza. The construction of this permanent negative pressure operating theatre was completed in June 2004.",

Similar to all other operating theatres in Hong Kong around that period and up to the present day, the operating theatres were maintained at a positive pressure. Specifications such as the floor area, airflow quantity and pressure gradient were designed to meet the requirements of the British operating theatre standards, which have been commonly used as reference in Hong Kong.3, 4 The room pressure was maintained at +25 Pa. Areas around the operating theatre were also under positive pressure. By controlling the supply and extract airflow rates of each room in accordance with the design data given in\nFigure 1, a pressure gradient was developed in continuous progression through zones with increasing sterility. Outside air was introduced to the operating theatre through a perforated diffuser at ceiling level, directly above the surgical area. This led to a downward displacement of air above the operating table. Room air was extracted through a low-level exhaust grill located next to the back door and an embedded exhaust duct in the sidewall.",

To ensure sterility in the operating theatre, routine bacterial sampling using two types of plates [tryptone soy agar (TSA) and Sabouraud agar] was performed after each air duct cleansing and filter replacement. The plates were placed in three positions (i.e. high, low and at the air exhaust). The high position was located by the anaesthesia apparatus near the operating table, 2 m above floor level; the low position was located near the operating table, 1 m above floor level; and the air exhaust position was in front of either of the exhaust grilles. The SAS Super 100 Air Sampler (International Pbi, Milano, Italy) was used to obtain volumes of 500 L into two separate 55-mm culture plates of TSA (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and Sabouraud agar (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy I' Etoile, France). The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C for two days and five days for bacterial and fungal counts, respectively. A colony count of less than 30 colony-forming units (CFU)/m3 for the TSA agar and 3 CFU/m3 for the Sabouraud agar was adopted as the acceptable standard in all operating theatres, but a more stringent standard was applied to the theatre using laminar airflow.5\n",

            "text": "Theatre 1 (OT-1) of the main operating suite was chosen for pressure conversion for two main reasons. Firstly, OT-1 was the furthest away from the other operating theatres, making isolation easier to accomplish. It minimized the risk of air from the corridor being contaminated as a result of traffic flow and then being drawn into the negative pressure operating theatre, which could be a risk for wound infection. Secondly, it had two free sidewalls that could accommodate the addition of a separate exhaust system, and had its own scrub area and a separate induction room that could be converted into a room for removal of contaminated clothing. The main feature of the negative pressure design, compared with the positive pressure design, was the incorporation of a much stronger low-level exhaust system. The exhaust air passed through a two-stage filtration system (prefilter plus High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter) before its final disposal via an exhaust air fan. In order to achieve the designated airflow criteria, an anteroom was constructed at the front end of the scrub and induction rooms leading to OT-1. All doors leading to these negative pressure rooms were made airtight and interlocking. The physical layout and the airflow specification of the negative pressure operating theatre suite are shown in\nFigure 2. As OT-1 and OT-2 originally shared the same air conditioning system, a separate air conditioning system had to be built for OT-2 before the necessary changes were made to OT-1.",

In the computer model, the seven surgical staff standing upright and the patient lying on the operating table were represented as rectangular solid boxes. In the analysis, it was assumed that each staff member released infectious particles at a rate of 100 CFU/min from the body surface that faced the patient. Also, an assumption was made that an infectious particle release rate of 400 CFU/min occurred from the surgical incision site at the waist position and from the patient's upper surfaces. The main and satellite medical lamps were 350 W and 200 W, respectively, and produced heat fluxes from their downward surfaces. Each of the eight fluorescent lighting panels surrounding the perforated supply diffuser released a heat flux of 70 W. The flow of fresh air was 0.85 m3/s.",

Adding a deflector plate in front of Stabilizer 2 above the entrance door from the scrub room finally rectified this.\nTable I compares some room pressure measurements with the original design specifications.

Hence, in the surgical zone, the patient is in a lower temperature environment (closer to the temperature of the supply air) than the general environment. This amounted to a difference of 4\u20135 \u00b0C, being more pronounced in the negative pressure model. The vertical temperature stratification was not obvious in most free positions of the room (around 2 \u00b0C difference from feet to head level for most room positions).

At the level of the respiratory system, i.e. 1.6 m above floor level, the concentration of infectious particles released from the patient was less than 10 CFU/m3. This means that surgical staff are at little risk of being infected by the patient during the operation. At the same time, there was no evidence that adding the deflector plate affected the airflow streams. The flow pattern in Figure 7(b) shows a better flow in the surgical zone than in Figure 7(a). Hence, lower bacteria concentration levels in the same zone were achieved.",

Careful selection of the site is required to avoid contamination from other sites such as hospital wards. It has been shown that although the actual pressure differentials in the negative pressure rooms after completion may not meet the design specification, the actual working conditions can still be adequate if the designated airflow path and flow rates can be maintained. In the present case, repeated testing and the results of periodical air sampling checks confirmed the quality of the completed work. Moreover, the steady-state simulation results showed that the level of thermal comfort as well as the dispersion behaviour of the bacteria in the negative pressure theatre were as good as, if not better than, those in the original positive pressure design.",
