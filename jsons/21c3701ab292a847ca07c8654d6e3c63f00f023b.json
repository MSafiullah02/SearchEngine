This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1\u03b2, -6, and TNF-\u03b1) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic \u03b2-coronavirus, which infects human airways and enters cells by binding its S (spike) protein envelope to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) after S protein priming by host serine protease TMPRSS2 [7] . hACE2 is present in type II alveolar cells (representing about 80% of all hACE2-expressing cells), nasal mucosa, upper respiratory tract, endothelium, heart, kidney, and intestine cells [8] . It has been reported that patients with diabetes, hypertension, or patients treated with ibuprofen are at higher risk of contracting severe . In these patients, because there is increased expression of hACE2 on lung epithelial cells, some authors have postulated a connection between these points [12] . Of note, another receptor, CD147, has been implicated in mediating host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2 [13]. After binding to its receptor, the virus enters the cells through endocytosis, viral RNA is released into the cytosol, the virus exploits the cell machinery to replicate, and it is further excreted from the cell by exocytosis [14] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 19 patients have high levels of circulating TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, sIL-2R\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-3, M-CSF, MIP-1a, G-CSF, IP-10 and MCP-1 [23,26]. These results are suggestive of hypercytokinemia, which is a hallmark of COVID-19. Nevertheless, only the serum concentrations of certain of these cytokines make it possible to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof discriminate between mild, moderate, and severe cases (mainly IL-1 \u03b2, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IP-10, and TNF-\u03b1) [26]. In addition, the levels of these cytokines in mild/moderate cases are generally below levels observed in usual macrophage activation syndrome/reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (MAS/reHLH) or in severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [27,28]. Thus, hypercytokinemia should be regarded as a general marker of SARS-CoV-2, while the term 'cytokine storm' should be kept for those situations of overly exuberant inflammation leading to critical conditions, such as ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation or multiple organ failure. Within cells, RNA viruses are sensed by the innate immune system through three major classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs): toll-like receptors (i.e. TLR-3, -7, -8), RIG-Ilike receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [29]. Among TLRs, only TLR-7 and -8 recognize single stranded viral genomic RNA. Nonetheless, other cytosolic sensors such as TLR-3 and RIG-I/MDA5 may detect the virus intermediates during intracellular replication, including double stranded RNA [30]. These recognitions then activate downstream signaling effectors, i.e. NF-\u0138B and IRF3/7. NF-\u0138B promotes the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, further triggering Th1 and Th17 inflammatory responses with subsequent secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17. IRF3/7 promote type-I IFN production, which in turn activates the JAK1/TYK2-STAT1/2 pathway. STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex with IRF9 that translocates into the nucleus where it initiates the transcription of hundreds of genes called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). An early and robust type-I IFN response is required as the very first line of defense to suppress viral replication and spread. Early NLR engagement has also been postulated during the innate immune response against coronaviruses [16]. Evidence of NLRs directly recognizing viral RNA is scant [31], however, NLRs are more possibly involved in detecting intracellular homeostasis perturbations or danger signals, such as ROS production [32,33]. Evidence of their involvement can be found J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof in the observation of high levels of circulating IL-1\u03b2, IL1-Ra, and IL-18 [23,26] and synergistic upregulation of IL1 and IL1RN genes in the lung [34]. Indeed, some NLRs are able to assemble a multimolecular platform termed inflammasome (via recruiting the adaptor ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which in turn activates the proinflammatory caspase-1. Caspase-1 cleaves and activates IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, and induces a hyperinflammatory form of cell death, termed pyroptosis, through the cleavage of the poreforming gasdermin-D [32,35]. IL-1 family cytokines include IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and their bioavailability is regulated by soluble antagonists (IL-1Ra, IL-18BP) of either endogenous origin or resulting from therapeutic intervention [36,37]. The most frequently studied inflammasome sensor, NLRP3, drives inflammation during SARS-CoV infection through several activating pathways [38-41]. Given the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, comparable mechanisms likely intervene during the acute phase of COVID-19. Of note, the cytosolic sensor RIG-I can also associate with ASC to form a non-canonical inflammasome inducing caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL1-\u03b2/IL-18 secretion and pyroptosis [42]. IL-1\u03b2 secretion may itself contribute to hypercytokinemia since IL-1\u03b2 further induces the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Lastly, high levels of chemokines and their coupled receptors have been observed in COVID-19 patients [22,23,26]. Accordingly, analysis of the molecular signature within the BALFs of patients revealed a plethora of upregulated chemokine transcripts, including neutrophilrecruiting mediators (CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL7) and other attractants of monocytes and immune cells (CXCL6, CXCL11, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL8, CCL20) [34]. These results are consistent with pathological findings attesting to lung infiltration by monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, in contrast with lower amounts of lymphocytes [43].

Patients with high viral loads and long virus-shedding periods are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 [15] . The early onset of rapid viral replication may cause massive epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, vascular leakage, as well as pro-inflammatory mediator release [16] . Furthermore, hACE2 downregulation and shedding by viral S protein can cause dysfunction of the reninangiotensin system and exacerbate inflammation and vascular permeability leading to acute lung injury [17, 18] . Finally, recent data have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect T cells through receptor-dependent, S protein-mediated membrane fusion [19] . Nevertheless, T cells have a very low expression level of hACE2, suggesting either an alternative receptor or high S protein affinity for hACE2. T cell infection is abortive, meaning that SARS-CoV-2 cannot replicate within T cells but rather induces cell death [19] . In SARS-CoV infection, the modulation of TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17) by the spike protein of SARS-CoV and hACE2 induces TNF-\u03b1 production which may accentuate T cell apoptosis [20, 21] . In this vein, Xiong et al. reported upregulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and p53 pathways in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients, when compared to healthy controls [22] .",

Type-I IFN is mainly produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are less sensitive to productive viral infection and/or virus-mediated cytotoxicity and can produce other inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 or control T cell response [47, 48] . pDCs are circulating immune cells, which act as sentinels and are activated after physical contact with virally-infected cells and transfer of PAMPs to the TLR7 sensors in pDCs, part of a process termed interferogenic synapse [49] . Considering the 80% overlap between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it has been speculated that the latter uses similar strategies to dampen innate immune response. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV2 appears to have lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV (with about a 10%-fatality rate) suggesting a lesser IFN antagonism [50] . On the other hand, exceptional genetic defects or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f immunosenescence may account for a reduced type-I IFN response and greater severity of COVID-19. Accordingly increased age is associated with a poorer outcome [3, 6, 23, 51] .",

More intriguingly, autopsies have revealed that secondary lymphoid tissues had been destroyed with atrophied spleen and decreased lymphocyte numbers, accompanied by significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, plus macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis. Lymph nodes were atrophied and their number decreased, with signs of necrosis.

This often manifests as an unexpected aggravation of symptoms (fever, dyspnea) and is correlated with increased levels of acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin), coagulopathy (elevated titers of d-dimers, disseminated intravascular coagulation), and cell lysis (CK, LDH) [3, 4, 11, 23, 59] . In the most severe patients, clinical and laboratory parameters correlated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and sIL2-R\u03b1), evocative of a cytokine storm [3, [73] [74] [75] . Interestingly, ARDS occurs in SARS-CoV patients despite a diminishing viral load, suggesting that exuberant host immune response may be responsible for this outcome rather than viral virulence. Such a cytokine profile is strongly reminiscent of both Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS, seen in CAR T cell therapy) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [76, 77] .",

Although an alternative pathway of primary hyperactivated innate immunity is possible, it is more likely that this cytokine storm occurs due to the combination of a defective (or delayed) first line of defense, followed by persistent hypercytokinemia (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1), and dysfunctional T cell response (generally cytotoxicity). This results in an impaired clearance of apoptic cells or infected/activated macrophages, an increase in viral replication and dissemination, followed by an IL-18/IFN-\u03b3 feedforward loop activating macrophages, culminating in multiple cytokine release, hemophagocytosis, coagulopathy, and ARDS ( Figure 2 ) [85, 88, 89] . Some of these mediators may further fuel this vicious cycle, including NK cell function impairment by IL-6 [71] or macrophage activation by the H-chain of ferritin [90] [91] [92] . Quite importantly, hemophagocytosis has been reported in lung tissues from patients who succumbed to SARS-CoV infection [93] .",

Evidence is mainly derived from experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [95] . In vivo, type-I is most often used in combination with other antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir [96] [97] [98] [99] or ribavirin [100] [101] [102] . In vitro, IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 have very systematically demonstrated robust efficacy against coronaviruses, but proved disappointing when transposed to human diseases [95, 96, 100, 103] . Multiple biases in these trials have prevented drawing conclusions from them. These biases include: coronavirus escape strategies to type-I IFN, limited sample sizes, heterogeneous experimental designs/clinical conditions, the nature of IFN isoform, administration route, plus difficulties in assessing whether disease outcome was linked to type-I IFN or to the drugs used in combination. Key points which have emerged from these studies are: (i) IFN-\u03b21b and IFN-\u03b21a are the most potent subtypes for SARS-CoV inhibition (probably even more for SARS-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CoV-2) [56, 104, 105] ; (ii) type-I IFN must be administered as soon as possible after infection (ideally before symptom onset) although not in the late phase, because of possible tissue damage [5, 52, 106, 107] ; and (iii) although IFN-\u03b1 inhalation can lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and serve in prophylaxis or treatment (Chinese guidelines) [108] , the preferred solutions remain the better-evaluated, safer intravenous and subcutaneous routes [94, 109] . amounted to zero for both groups, whereas over 2,000 new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed among medical personnel over the same period.

IL-7 exerts anti-apoptotic properties and induces potent proliferation of naive and memory T cells leading to replenishment of the circulating pool (CD4+ and CD8+) [112, 113] . IL-7 also increases T cell receptor repertoire diversity [114] and promote the expression of cell adhesion molecules, improving the capacity of T cells to traffic to infection sites [115] . More importantly, the administration of recombinant IL-7 (rIL-7) does not induce hyperinflammatory response through stimulating adaptive immunity. Indeed, rIL-7 has been successfully used to treat T cell exhaustion following septic shock and restore CD4+ T cells in HIV patients, with no evidence of clinical deterioration nor proinflammatory marker exacerbation (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CRP) [116, 117] . Surprisingly, at the time of writing this review, there is no trial registered yet to evaluate this strategy. If such a study were to be launched, the perfect timing for lymphocyte restoration would need to be strictly determined.",

By binding to IL-18R, IL-18 (in combination with IL-12/-15) acts on CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells to induce IFN-\u03b3, the major driver of macrophage activation syndrome (i.e. HLH) [85, 86, 89, 143] . IL-18 is one of the upregulated cytokines in sera and BALF from COVID-19 patients [26, 144] . In addition, IL-18 has been reported as a biomarker of Still's disease, its levels being correlated with disease activity [145] . High levels of serum IL-18 have also been reported in patients with a newly-described autoinflammatory disease associating pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recurrent macrophage activation syndrome (IL18PAP-MAS) [146] . Tadekinig alfa is a recombinant IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP, a naturally-occurring inhibitor of IL-18) which has shown encouraging results in Still's disease [135, 136] .

Actually, there are even conflicting results showing a mild elevation in the sera of non-severe patients [23, 26, 75, 150] . However, one meta-analysis has shown a link between high IL-6/IFN-\u03b3 ratio and disease severity, thereby indicating that lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 should rather predict poorer outcomes [151] . Emapalumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IFN-\u03b3 is approved for treating pediatric and adult primary HLH patients with refractory, recurrent, or progressive disease or intolerance to conventional therapy (despite a lack of clinical trial data in adults) [152, 153] . However, in the single RCT on 34 patients, serious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of the recipients, including (bacterial, viral, and opportunistic) infections and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In addition, data from mouse models suggest that simultaneously inhibiting multiple cytokinesignaling pathways (such as with JAK inhibitors) may be more effective than targeting IFN-\u03b3 alone [154, 155] . RCTs are now ongoing to evaluate emapalumab in HLH (either primary or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reactive: NCT01818492, NCT0331275, NCT03985423, NCT03311854) and in COVID-19 (NCT04324021).",

Since TNF inhibitors are readily available and well-evaluated drugs, some authors postulate that there is sufficient evidence to conduct clinical trials in COVID-19 [157] . Nevertheless, the literature remains very scanty when exploring possible treatments for cytokine storm or HLH. Indeed, while a few case reports described the benefits of etanercept [158] [159] [160] , other studies have shown that it may trigger or worsen disease progression [161] [162] [163] . However, some cases argue for TNF inhibitors use in COVID-19: (i) TNF neutralization provides protection against SARS-CoV infection in animal models [164] ; (ii) anti-TNF induce a rapid decrease of IL-6 and IL-1 concentrations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [165] ; (iii) anti-TNF trigger a reduction of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor, which is partly responsible for capillary leak [166, 167] ; and (iv) anti-TNF lead to less leucocyte traffick to inflamed tissues due to reduced adhesion molecules and chemokines with subsequent reduction of cell content and exudate [168] . It is suggested that initial assessments of TNF inhibitors should be done in patients with moderate disease, as soon as possible after their admission to hospital [157] . To date, only a single RCT evaluating adalimumab in COVID-19",

Indeed, a systematic review of observational studies on corticosteroids administered to SARS-CoV infected patients reported no survival benefit, plus potential harm (although mostly inconclusive) [95] . Similarly, a systematic review of observational studies in influenza found a higher risk of mortality and secondary infections with (high-dose) corticosteroids [172] . Further, a study of patients given corticosteroids for MERS-CoV infection revealed delayed clearance of the virus and zero effect of corticosteroids on mortality [173] . Finally, while most previous guidelines did not recommend corticosteroid use for treating sepsis in the absence of refractory shock, a recent statement (triggered by the analysis of two RCTs) made a weak recommendation to use corticosteroids in sepsis patients [174] . Altogether, it has become apparent that corticosteroids may be more detrimental than beneficial in COVID-19 and the WHO (as well as IDSA) recommends that they not be used outside of clinical trials [175] . However, given that these data are derived from previous infections, corticosteroids binding to hACE2 in vitro, or inhibit viral cycle [181] . In addition, they are used in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (mainly systemic lupus erythematosus) for their immunomodulating properties. It is hypothesized that their action is tied to their ability to accumulate in lysosomes where they raise pH and interfere with antigen degradation and presentation to CD4+ T cells [182, 183] . Data also indicate that they reduce proinflammatory IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 [184, 185] . Lastly, they inhibit endosomal TLRs and have antiinflammatory effects, such inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis or lipid peroxidation [186] [187] [188] .",

The JAK/STAT pathway lies downstream of several cytokines which are increased in HLH and thus it is an attractive target to abrogate the signaling of multiple cytokine pathways [198] . However, caution should be applied in using JAK inhibitors because: (i) COVID-19 can be complicated by coagulopathy with increased frequency of thromboembolic events, and the FDA has recently warned clinicians about increased thromboembolism risk with some JAK inhibitors [199] ; ii) treatment with JAK inhibitors is associated with increased frequency of herpes zoster virus reactivation; and (iii) pan-JAK inhibitors may repress some cytokines required for antiviral defense (type-I IFN) or for immune restoration (IL-2, IL-7) [200, 201] .",

The disease is polyphasic in nature, with secondary cytokine storm and ARDS resulting in poor outcomes, plus overwhelmed intensive care units and hospitals. In the very early stages of the disease, treatment should focus on reducing viral load either by specific antivirals or by stimulating type-I IFN. Later on, in selected patients, therapies targeting proinflammatory cytokines could suppress hyperinflammation, while some cytokines (IL-7) could theoretically trigger immune restoration. In clinical practice, unfortunately, patients are unlikely to be detected early enough (i.e. before/at symptom onset) to benefit from antiviral strategies. Therefore, factors to predict progression toward severe forms of the disease are, at present, the most urgently needed and awaited determinants. A highly-structured approach, which includes immune monitoring, would thus be of utmost importance.",

Data derived from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks have revealed that coronaviruses suppress type-I IFN response by interfering with PRRs or type-I IFN receptor-signaling pathways. For instance, SARS-CoV induces the degradation of RNA sensor adaptor molecules, MAVS and TRAF3/6, thus inhibiting IRF3 translocation into the nucleus. MERS-CoV employs additional strategies, such as repression of histone modifications. Both viruses inhibit JAK/STAT signaling by decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation.",

The authors found that treatment with IFN-\u03b12b -with or without umifenovirsignificantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and reduced the duration of elevated inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP). Unfortunately, this study has major flaws: (i) the study did not include a control group; (ii) only moderate forms of COVID-19 were included, with a median time from symptom onset to treatment of 11 days (range, 5 -22); (iii) patients in the IFN-\u03b1-treated group were significantly younger and had fewer comorbidities; (iv) the only patients treated with IFN-\u03b12b alone were women; and (v) treatment regimens were quite heterogeneous since, in the combination group, 34% of patients received IFN-\u03b12b as add-on to umifenovir and 52% started IFN-\u03b12b after umifenovir had been stopped. None of the patients developed end organ dysfunction, nor respiratory failure requiring oxygen or critical care management. Interestingly, another study prospectively evaluated IFN-\u03b11b nasal drops to prevent medical staff SARS-CoV-2 infection[111]. 2,944 medical staff members were allocated to either a low-risk group (n=2,415, 4-6 drops q.i.d. for 28 days) or a high-risk group (nasal drops + subcutaneous thymosin-\u03b11 every J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f week) depending on their exposure to the coronavirus.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial/endothelial cells, via binding to ACE2 (and CD147), induces apoptotic and necroptotic pathways resulting in lung injury and release of numerous chemokines driving the recruitment of large amounts of immune cells within the lungs. Dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, the main source of type-I interferon (IFN)), along with alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, promote the innate immune response by secreting alarmins and antiviral or proinflammatory cytokines, plus presenting the antigen to adaptive immune cells. SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved strategies to downregulate the type-I IFN response and induce T cell apoptosis. The recognition of molecular patterns (viral RNA, particles, or danger signals) by various Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) or RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) activates the transcription and release of proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, -6, -18, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. These mediators further skew na\u00efve T-cells to Th1 or cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs or CD8+), which in turn secrete amounts of cytokines. A proinflammatory feedforward loop of cytokines on innate immune cells results in cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 cytokine storm may intertwine two mechanisms; one highly suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, HLH) driven by IL-1\u03b2, and another pattern characterized by immune dysregulation driven by IL-6, which triggers immunoparalysis (decreased HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes) and global lymphopenia.
