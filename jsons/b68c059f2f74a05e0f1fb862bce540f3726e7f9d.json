There are several recent articles, such as [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] , which provide mathematical models. The goal of this note is to present a rather simple mathematical model for the evolution of the corona virus, where we merely concentrate on the number of deaths due to the corona virus. However, from adequate predictions of these numbers of deaths, we will also obtain estimates for the number of infected people and for the probability that an individual of a population is infected at a certain time point. The mathematical model is intended to be simple enough such that practitioners can use it in order to compute different scenarios for the future. Even pupils attending secondary school with basic knowledge in differential calculus should be able to understand the model.",

However, since the measures are equally tight as those in China, it is reasonable to take the same parameter \u03bb = ln(3.25). Figure 4 . This plot shows a prediction of the numbers of deaths in Italy from February 21 to April 30, together with the fitted function D. Figure 4 shows the available data points together with the predicted scenario according to the estimated parameters (\u03b2, \u03bb).

For example, for Iran, Spain, Germany, USA, France, South Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium data are available. For most of the countries the concavity parameter is easy to fit; exceptions are USA and France (despite many data) as well as countries for which so far only few data exists. Apart from South Korea, for each country the concavity parameter \u03b2 is larger than 0.6, which is the value for China. However, typically the concavity parameter is less than one, which means that the function L is really concave, and not linear. Two exceptions are Germany and United Kingdom, where the current estimates are \u03b2 = 1.",
