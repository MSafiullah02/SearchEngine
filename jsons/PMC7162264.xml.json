In the latter half of\nthe twentieth century, many shared this bold view that medical science had vanquished\ninfectious disease. As a result, public health struggled to remain relevant in the face\nof advances in pharmaceuticals, surgery, genetics and other areas that were becoming\nincreasingly dominant in the quest to extend and enhance human life. SARS forced many to\nrethink the significance of public health and the crisis, though relatively short-lived,\n(for commentary on the disparities between the responses to HIV and SARS, see e.g. Altman (2003)) underscored the need to rebuild\npublic health capacity that had been allowed to slip down the health system priority\nlist.",

I identify legislative authority\nfor imposing quarantine on individuals and discuss limits on its use. Although the law\nmay confer broad authority on public health officials to impose measures like\nquarantine, I argue those officials ought to be guided by ethical principles in\nconsidering when to use coercive powers that abrogate individual liberties. To this end,\nI discuss ethical frameworks to guide and inform public health decision making.

The disease traveled to Canada in late February\n2003 when an elderly woman who acquired the disease in Hong Kong returned to her home in\nToronto, Ontario, Canada's most populous metropolitan area with approximately 4.6\nmillion people. She died 10 days after her return. Two days later, her 44-year-old son\nwent to the emergency department of a major Toronto hospital, exhibiting high fever, a\nsevere cough and difficulty in breathing \u2013 symptoms that a couple of weeks later would\ntrigger alarm bells as a potential SARS case, but, at the time, health care workers did\nnot know what confronted them. While awaiting admission, the man remained in an open\narea of a busy emergency department for 18\u201320 hours. This delay in admitting and\nisolating him was due, in part, to hospital overcrowding. Many patients and staff were\nexposed to the man before he was isolated. This patient died a week later.

When the blood\nwas collected from the donors between 1984 and 1985, they were not advised that the\nblood would be tested for HIV as no such testing capacity existed at that time. When\ntesting became available, the Canadian Red Cross Society tested the stored samples to\ntrace any recipients of contaminated blood. Twenty-two HIV-positive donors were\nidentified; nine of whom had previously been identified, leaving 13 remaining donors.\nThe issue that arose in this case was whether the Red Cross should notify the donors and\nreport them to the Province of Ontario in accordance with the Health Protection\nand Promotion Act. The Canadian AIDS Society objected to donor notification\nand reporting on the basis that the donors had not consented to testing their blood for\nHIV, and notification and reporting would violate the donors\u2019 privacy rights.",

As with other countries hit hard by\nthe outbreak, quarantine was heavily used as a public health intervention to attempt to\ncontrol the disease in Toronto, Canada. Individuals in Canada and other countries were\nextremely compliant in voluntarily accepting a temporary restriction on their liberty\nfor the broader benefit of their communities. However, public health officials cannot\nalways assume individuals will not resist coercive restrictions. Anderson and colleagues\n(2004) give the following caution:\u2026it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the\nworld community was very lucky this time round, given the very low transmissibility of\nthe agent, plus the fact that fairly draconian public health measures could be put in\nplace with great efficiency in Asian regions where the epidemic originated. Given the\nlitigious nature of people in North America in particular, and to a lesser degree in\nwestern Europe, the control of SSEs [super-spreading events] in these regions might have\npresented greater problems if mass quarantining had been required.
