A CHIK fever epidemic is characterized by its sudden disappearance for a considerably long period from a particular geographic area before its resurgence. This has been well documented in the Republic of the Congo and Indonesia. However, in early 2005, a major epidemic of CHIK fever started in many Indian Ocean island nations, and in late 2005, it started spreading to several parts of India, after a hiatus of epidemic activity of nearly 32 years. This recent outbreak of CHIK infection in many parts of southern India is a point of major concern. This was the largest and most severe epidemic, affecting 11,000,000 persons in Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, and Karnataka states of southern India and spreading to several new areas, with huge public health and administrative concerns to control the epidemic [10] . Although the resurgence of CHIK fever was anticipated, this epidemic is considered to be unprecedented, owing to the magnitude of morbidity and geographical distribution. In several villages, 190% of inhabitants were found to be affected [7] , with an estimated figu e of 1.3 million cases to date [11] . In 2006, outbreaks of CHIK fever were reported from 194 districts in 12 states across India. The clinical manifestations of cases in the current outbreak match the known description of the disease. Analysis of the 2006 outbreak suggested that the increased severity of disease may have been associated with a change in the genetic sequence, altering the virus coat protein, which potentially allowed the virus to multiply more easily in mosquito cells [12] . Laboratory diagnosis is critical to establish the diagnosis and to initiate a specifi public health response. The alphavirus species can be characterized by hemagglutination inhibition, ELISA, complement fixation and neutralization of viral infectivity using reference serum samples [1, 9] . Serodiagnosis rests on demonstrating a 4-fold increase in CHIK virus IgG antibody titer between the acute-and convalescentphase serum samples. Because obtainment of paired serum samples is usually not practical, the demonstration of IgM antibodies specifi for CHIK virus in acute-phase serum specimens is done. A CHIK-positive viral culture, coupled with neutralization by reference serum, is taken to be definitiv proof of the presence of CHIK virus.

The LAMP method is cost-effective, because it requires only 1 type of DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. In the present study, the 1-step, single-tube, real-time accelerated RT-LAMP assay was standardized by targeting the immunodominant E1 gene for rapid and real-time detection of CHIK virus. In our study, the RT-LAMP assay uncovered 20 additional cases of infection, which were detected by naked eye or with a UV lamp. These samples had negative RT-PCR results, thereby proving the high sensitivity of RT-LAMP. There were a few mismatches in the RT-PCR primers (i.e., 1 base in the forward primer and 2 bases in the reverse primer), but they did not affect the test's sensitivity [20] . All of the RT-PCR-positive samples also yielded positive RT-LAMP results. The RT-LAMP allows rapid, realtime detection of CHIK virus in acute-phase serum samples, without requiring sophisticated equipment, and has potential usefulness for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of CHIK virus in developing countries.
