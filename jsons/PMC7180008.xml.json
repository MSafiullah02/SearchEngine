And although our residents are working to ensure imaging studies are rapidly dictated and necessary interventional procedures are performed, many are stepping up to the front lines alongside our medical and surgical colleagues. Despite these challenges, we continue to learn in adaptive ways through consistency, flexibility, innovation, and, importantly, social distancing.",

            "text": "Along with free open access education, strategies to aid learning generally fall into the following four areas.1.Consistency with the \u201cstatus quo\u201d using virtual platforms. Traditional radiology teaching stems from clinical \u201cat the workstation\u201d learning as well as didactic and case-based teaching. Continuing this approach virtually gives residents a sense of normalcy. Residents now read out with a dedicated teaching attending through a built-in chat function and virtual screen sharing. Daily didactic teaching is delivered virtually via WebEx (Cisco, Milptas, California), with residents logging in from their workstations.Residents can also host \u201cvirtual rounds\u201d with clinicians on the floors. For example, senior residents lead pediatric intensive care unit rounds via video conferencing and screen sharing. Residents gather clinical information from the team and interpret or review radiographic findings. Even in this time of social distancing, residents add value by maintaining open lines of communication with referring teams, thereby improving workflow efficiency and patient management.2.Continuity of learning through innovative approaches. The key is to be creative and find innovative ways to meet resident educational needs without burdening radiologists who are trying to meet increasing clinical demands. For example, our neuroradiology section now sends out weekly articles (ie, radiographics) with accompanying multiple-choice questions that can be answered on a mobile device. In contrast, our abdominal imaging section hosts a virtual \u201cbody club\u201d in which residents discuss body imaging cases encountered when on rotation or on call.3.Informatics: PACS database and radiologic-pathologic learning. Institutions should update their teaching files and accessible databases of existing cases for trainee review. By harnessing the power of informatics, a quick search of the PACS database can quickly identify COVID-19 cases, which could then be reviewed by residents and faculty to \u201ctrain their eye\u201d on the multimodality appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia. Radiology-pathology correlation can be streamlined by creating a module that sends automated e-mails once pathology or operative reports become available for imaging cases, thereby enhancing resident learning and improving accuracy.4.Residents as teachers. As medical schools transition to a virtual platform, radiology trainees can play a prominent role in teaching, particularly using imaging as a means to teach anatomy and disease pathology, possibly in an interdisciplinary setting. Perhaps a \u201cvirtual radiology elective\u201d would offer students a structured learning platform.\n",

The ability to share a teaching session allows medical students and visiting learners to participate remotely.

Multiple radiology societies, including the ACR, AUR, APDR, and RSNA, quickly organized and disseminated free learning material for residents with the aim of providing a core resident curriculum. In addition, senior residents with an interest in radiology education can help develop curricular materials in their area of interest when they are on a remote study rotation.",

This rapid and exponential integration of distance learning has great promise to reach learners across the globe and potentially attract the best and brightest students into the field.
