SUMO has a critical role in the signaling pathway governing type I interferon (IFN) production, and among the SUMOylation substrates are many IFN-induced proteins. The overall effect of IFN is increasing global SUMOylation, pointing to SUMO as part of the antiviral stress response. Viral agents have developed different mechanisms to counteract the antiviral activities exerted by SUMO, and some viruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation machinery to modify their own proteins. The exploitation of SUMO has been mainly linked to nuclear replicating viruses due to the predominant nuclear localization of SUMO proteins and enzymes involved in SUMOylation. However, SUMOylation of numerous viral proteins encoded by RNA viruses replicating at the cytoplasm has been lately described. Whether nuclear localization of these viral proteins is required for their SUMOylation is unclear. Here, we summarize the studies on exploitation of SUMOylation by cytoplasmic RNA viruses and discuss about the requirement for nuclear localization of their proteins.",

The resulting mature forms of SUMO are then activated by the SUMOactivating E1 enzyme (SAE1/SAE2). Subsequently, the SUMO molecule is transferred to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, the only E2 SUMOylation enzyme discovered to date. Finally, the carboxyl group of the glycine residues at the SUMO carboxy terminus forms an isopeptide linkage with the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein, a step that can be facilitated by SUMO E3 ligases. SUMOylation can be then reversed by SENPs. Usually, the target lysine for SUMO is located in the consensus sequence \u03c8KxE (where \u03c8 is a hydrophobic residue and x any residue) in the target protein, although SUMO can be also conjugated to lysine residues located in non-consensus sequences. Four different SUMO isoforms have been described in mammals (SUMO1 to SUMO4). SUMO1 protein is found mainly conjugated to targets due to its limited quantity and only shares 50% identity with SUMO2/3. SUMO2 and SUMO3 share 97% sequence identity and often are referred to as SUMO2/3, and its conjugation is stress-inducible [1] . SUMO4 remains poorly characterized and its physiological relevance is still unclear [2, 3] . The main function of SUMO proteins is to regulate protein-protein interaction, which ultimately results in changes in protein subcellular localization or stability, transcription, DNA repair, innate immunity, or antiviral defense. Interestingly, many SUMO-modified proteins contain SUMOinteracting motifs (SIMs), allowing the noncovalent interaction of SUMO substrates with SUMO or non-SUMOylated proteins [4, 5] .",

Once RIG-I is activated, it recruits the inhibitor of kB kinase (IKK) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b5 through its interaction with MAVS, leading to the activation of NF-k\u03b2, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, and IRF7, and consequently resulting in IFN\u03b2 and NF-k\u03b2 promoter activation. Frequently, the activation of both NF-k\u03b2 and IRF3/7 pathways by RIG-I in response to virus infection requires the NF-k\u03b2 essential modulator (NEMO), an adaptor protein that organizes the assembly of IKKs into activated high-molecular-weight complexes. Conjugation of SUMO2/3 to NEMO, a process downmodulated by SENP6, inhibits its interaction with the deubiquitinase CYLD strengthening the activation of IKK [7] . The noncanonical IKK kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which mediates the activation of IRF3, has also been shown to be a pivotal player in antiviral innate immunity, and its modification by SUMO supports its antiviral function, likely through contributing to adaptor binding for the transduction of antiviral signaling [8] .",

In addition, SUMOylation of IRF3/ 7 in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I activation can act as a transcriptional repressor of IRF3 and IRF7, a mechanism that has been postulated to be part of the negative feedback loop of normal IFN signaling [12] . However, conjugation of SUMO to IRF3 not necessarily inhibits IRF3. Ran and colleagues found that SUMO can conjugate to K87 in IRF3, a lysine residue involved in IRF3 K48-ubiquitin conjugation and degradation [13] . Consequently, I IFN downmodulation of IRF3 SUMOylation induced by SENP2 promotes its ubiquitination, negatively regulating the virus-triggered type induction and cellular antiviral response [13] . Whereas PIAS1 has been reported to work as E3 SUMO ligase for both IRF3 and IRF7 [14] , the repression of the ability of IRF7 to induce type I IFN transcription by SUMOylation has been shown to be promoted by TRIM28 [15] . Together, these studies show that SUMO plays an important role in the type I IFN expression in response to RNA virus infection. [6] . Conjugation of SUMO to NEMO inhibits its interaction with the deubiquitinase CYLD strengthening the activation of IKK and inducing an increase of type I IFN production [7] ",

ISGF3 binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) leading to transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). This canonical type I IFN signaling can be modulated by SUMO ( Fig. 11 .2). SUMO has been shown to interact with STAT1 in a covalent manner, and this interaction has been proposed to inhibit STAT1 activity, since a STAT1 SUMOylation mutant is hyperphosphorylated and exhibits increased DNA binding on STAT1 responsive gene promoters [16] [17] [18] , and phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by IFN\u03b2 treatment inhibits its SUMOylation [19] . In addition, SUMO overexpression has been shown to reduce the IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and downmodulate IFN\u03b3 transcriptional responses [20] .

Thus, PML KO mice are more sensitive than WT to infection with different viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), or VSV, and cells from these mice are also more sensitive to infection with rabies virus [32] [33] [34] . In addition, overexpression of specific PML isoforms confers resistance to some virus infections. Thus, PMLIII protects against human foamy virus (HFV) [35] , poliovirus [36] , VSV, or influenza A virus [37] , and PMLIV confers resistance to rabies virus and EMCV infection [34] . PML interacts with SUMO in a covalent and noncovalent manner. SUMOylation of PML is required for PML-NB formation and for promoting SUMOylation of specific substrates recruited on PML-NBs [38] [39] [40] . Moreover, modification of PMLIV by SUMO positively regulates IFN\u03b2 synthesis through IRF3 activation, and it is required for protecting cells from virus infection [41] . PML-III and PML-IV also recruit Ubc9 to PML-NBs, and this recruitment has been shown to be essential for the increase in global SUMOylation induced by IFN [42] . This is not the unique mechanism that contributes to the increase in global SUMOylation upon IFN treatment. Among the IFN-regulated proteins is Lin28B, a RNA binding protein that represses the expression of miRNAs from let-7 family [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] which targets SUMO transcripts [48] .",

Rotavirus genome is constituted by 11 dsRNA segments encoding six structural (VP1-4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural (NSP1-6) proteins. Early stages of viral assembly and viral RNA replication take place in virus-induced inclusion bodies called viroplasms localized in the infected cell cytoplasm. Viroplasms are formed by VP1, VP2, VP3, VP6, NSP2, and NSP5. Five out of six of the viroplasms components, VP1, VP2, NSP2, VP6, and NSP5 proteins, are modified by SUMO; and three of them, VP1, VP2, and NSP2 proteins, also interact in a noncovalent manner with SUMO. SUMOylation of NSP5 has been shown to be essential for the formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) generated by overexpression of VP2 (VLS-VP2i). In addition, upregulation of SUMOylation positively modulates rotavirus replication and viral protein production, whereas interference of Ubc9 produces a marked decrease in the synthesis of viral proteins and virus titer [56] . The extensive exploitation of the SUMOylation machinery by rotavirus evokes to that described for influenza virus [57] .

The importance of NS5 SUMOylation for HCV was also supported by the constant reversion of the SUMO-defective mutant K348R of HCV NS5 to the WT sequence during virus replication [92] .

In contrast, exogenous overexpression of PIAS2 decreased HCV core, NS3, and NS5A expression and the viral assembly and budding efficiency. When expressed together with SUMO1, PIAS2 induced the degradation of HCV core, NS3, and NS5A proteins expressed from individual plasmids and after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, PIAS2 interacts with and enhances SUMOylation of the core protein.

Among these IFN upregulated genes, there are SUMO proteins as well as multiple targets of SUMO, suggesting that SUMO may play a role in immunity. Viruses have evolved to exploit the SUMOylation machinery of the cell to improve their replication. Many viral proteins are SUMOylated or influence the SUMOylation of cellular proteins. Initially, most of the viral proteins evaluated as putative SUMO substrates were nuclear proteins of DNA viruses or RNA viruses replicating in the nucleus because SUMO and SUMOylation pathway components are localized mainly at the cell nucleus. However, in recent years numerous studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic RNA viruses also exploit the cellular SUMO pathway. Although SUMOylation may contribute to the control of virus replication, SUMO seems to have an overall positive effect in most of the cytoplasmic RNA viruses. Thus, SUMO proteins or components of the SUMOylation pathway such as Ubc9 are required for the replication of some picornavirus, reovirus, nodavirus, and flavivirus and play a role in pnemovirus or flavivirus pathogenesis. In addition, SUMO conjugates to viral proteins from reovirus, paramyxovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, arterivirus, filovirus, and flavivirus, and only a few examples of a negative effect of SUMO have been reported for members of the Flaviviridae, Arteriviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families. Interestingly, many of the viral proteins from cytoplasmic RNA viruses that are SUMO substrates can be detected at the cell nucleus during the viral cell cycle. Additional information will be required in order to determine whether there is a relationship between these two events.",
