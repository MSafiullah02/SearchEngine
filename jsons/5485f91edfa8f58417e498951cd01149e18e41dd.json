Anthropogenic activities can influence the role of diseases by facilitating a transmission zone for disease from domestic animals into the carnivore population (Deem et al. 2001) . As increases in human population and habitat fragmentation continue, wildlife populations become isolated and there is an increased proximity of humans and their domesticated animals to wildlife (Deem et al. 2001) . Several studies have examined strictly urban carnivores, particularly those that are hosts for zoonotic diseases including coyote (Canis latrans; Grinder and Krausman 2001) ; raccoon (Procyon lotor; Junge et al. 2007) , and hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura; Hass and Dragoo 2006) . A few researchers examined disease exposure across an urban-rural gradient in species such as red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; Truyen et al. 1998) , bobcats (Lynx rufus), and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus; Riley et al. 2004 ). Studies of the effects of an urban environment on disease transmission are lacking for mountain lions. This is of particular concern for areas in Arizona that have high rates of urban expansion and that are adjacent to mountain lion habitat. Arizona is the fifth-fastest-growing state in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau; http://www.census. gov). Due to the species' solitary nature, intraspecific interactions among mountain lions are typically limited to territorial fights, mating, and family-group contacts (Logan and Sweanor 2001) . However, mountain lions that inhabit fragmented landscapes have an increased likelihood of contact with other species and domesticated animals and therefore may have an increased prevalence of disease exposure (Riley et al. 2004 ). The long-distance dispersal capabilities of this species (Launder 2007) increase opportunities for contact between domesticated and wild animals. We collected serologic data from 9 lions in the mountain ranges surrounding Tucson, southern Arizona, USA (32.1898N, 110.8818E) to establish baseline knowledge of enzootic pathogens at the urban-wildland interface. We tested for antibody or antigens to Feline Calicivirus (FCV); Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV); Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP); Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV); Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPLV; also known as Feline Parvovirus); Feline Syncytial Virus-Feline Foamy Virus (FSyV-FFV); Feline Herpesvirus (FHV); Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV); Canine Distemper Virus (CDV); and Toxoplasma gondii. We choose these diseases because their prevalence is common among domestic cats within the urban environment, and because interspecies transmission might occur or are of concern to humans. Feline Calicivirus is a highly infectious pathogen and, although all felids are susceptible, natural infection has only been reported in domestic cats and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus; Riley et al. 2004 , Nams 2006 . Feline Immunodeficiency Virus is endemic in cats throughout the world; although symptoms are well-documented in domestic cats and cheetahs, the virus has no historical association of pathogenicity in wild felids (Nellemann et al. 2003) . Feline Infectious Peritonitis is believed to be caused by FECV that has mutated slightly. Feline Enteric Coronavirus causes mild-to-severe enteritis (i.e., inflammation of the intestine) in kittens, and fever, vomiting, and diarrhea and can persist in the animal for years (Nellemann et al. 2001) . Feline Infectious Peritonitis, on the other hand, is severe and almost always fatal. A cat can carry the Coronavirus and never get FIP, but if there is some sort of immune suppression (e.g., stress or co-infection with another virus) that lowers the immune response, then the FIP virus begins replicating (Nellemann et al. 2001) . Feline Panleukopenia Virus is potentially a population-limiting viral disease of Felidae (Anderson 1983 ) and can cause disease in some members of related families (e.g., raccoon, mink [Mustela vison], and coatimundi [Nasua nasua; Nams 2006]). Feline Syncytial Virus and FHV were selected because they are ubiquitous throughout the cat world. The incidence of FeLV infection is directly related to the population density of cats. Despite vaccinations in captive wild and domestic cats, FeLV remains the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in cats worldwide (Nellemann et al. 2001) . Canine distemper was selected because it is common among dogs and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), which are both potential prey items for mountain lions. Toxoplasmosis (i.e., litter-box disease) is caused by the coccidian protozoa T. gondii (Cronin et al. 2000) . Cats do not show signs of illness while passing oocysts and an adult cat will not pass oocysts again after recovering from an initial exposure. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic hazard for humans and may cause abortion, stillbirth, or pre-term delivery in both humans and cats.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 154, "text": "(Bradley and Altizer 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 317, "end": 335, "text": "(Deem et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 533, "end": 551, "text": "(Deem et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 700, "end": 726, "text": "Grinder and Krausman 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 753, "end": 771, "text": "Junge et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 811, "end": 832, "text": "Hass and Dragoo 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 955, "end": 974, "text": "Truyen et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1058, "text": "Riley et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1602, "text": "(Logan and Sweanor 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1833, "text": "(Riley et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1908, "text": "(Launder 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2974, "end": 2991, "text": "Riley et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2992, "end": 3003, "text": ", Nams 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3218, "end": 3241, "text": "(Nellemann et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3517, "end": 3540, "text": "(Nellemann et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3848, "end": 3871, "text": "(Nellemann et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3963, "end": 3977, "text": "(Anderson 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4444, "end": 4467, "text": "(Nellemann et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4713, "end": 4733, "text": "(Cronin et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "During 2005-2008, as part of a larger study, we used hounds and leg-hold snares to capture and radio-collar mountain lions (see Nicholson 2009 for further details).

We also calculated the percent of each home range that was in an urban area (Fig. 1) . We created an urban boundary layer by combining high-resolution satellite imagery (1-m pixel resolution) with an Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) urban boundary layer and a road-density layer. The ADOT city layer already accounted for incorporated cities in Arizona and we used this layer as the base map. To find towns not accounted for, or to modify the existing boundary of an ADOT city boundary, we used the road-density layer to locate high-density areas (>3 km of road/0.5 km 2 ) and overlaid them on satellite imagery. We then used headsup digitizing to outline urban areas (for more details see Nicholson 2009 ). We attempted a series of binary linear-regression models using a logit-link function for each disease. We assumed exposure to each virus was independent. We used a naturallog transformation to normalize home range size data and hypothesized that the larger the home range (essentially, the more area used by an individual), the more likely the individual would test positive for a disease. Similarly, we assumed that the greater the percentage of a mountain lion's home range that overlapped an urban area, the more likely it would test positive for a disease because of the increased chance of exposure to, and transfer of disease from, domesticated animals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 57, "text": "(Nicholson 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 102, "end": 115, "text": "(Worton 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 178, "end": 199, "text": "(Rodgers et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 903, "end": 917, "text": "Nicholson 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 286, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "STUDY AREA AND METHODS"}, {"text": "The disease agent detected with the highest prevalence in our study was T. gondii (Table 1) , which is enzootic in Felidae.

Commercially available ELISA kits based on domestic cat FIV do not have an acceptable ability to recognize seropositive samples from mountain lions (Franklin et al. 2007 ). Because of this, our results (n \u00bc 3/9 [33%]) may not completely depict actual exposure to FIV. Using PLV-specific ELISA test to screen wild felid populations for lentivirus exposure may provide more reliable results.
