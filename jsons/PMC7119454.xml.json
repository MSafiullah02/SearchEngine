            "text": "Influenza viruses, in the family Orthomyxoviridae, are single-stranded, negative strand RNA viruses. Among the 3 influenza types (A, B and C), influenza A has been responsible for all known major epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A viruses circulate in more than 18 mammalian species (including pigs and humans), but the main reservoir is aquatic wildfowl, including migratory birds.6 The genome of influenza A is made up of 8 separate gene segments that may individually \u201creassort\u201d with other influenza A virus gene segments to markedly shift antigenic characteristics (Figure 1\n).3., 4., 5., 6. The viruses are classified according to the subtypes of 2 surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Hemagglutinin, a surface glycoprotein that is essential for viral binding and entry into host cells, contains the primary epitopes for protective neutralizing antibodies. Neuraminidase is required for viral release and plays a lesser role in protective immunity. A subtle accumulation of changes in the HA epitopes may lead to a \u201cdrift\u201d in protective immunity to circulating strains, prompting a yearly review of the antigenic content of influenza vaccines. Although there are 16 known subtypes of HA, only 3 have successfully adapted to human transmission resulting in pandemics\u2014H1 in 1918, H2 in 1957 and H3 in 1968 (Table 1\n).",

The 2009 swine-origin H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus seems to be the result of a further reassortment of the swine triple-reassortant virus with acquisition of the neuraminidase and matrix gene segments from a Eurasian H1N1 swine virus (Figure 1) and the capacity for efficient human-to-human spread.3., 4., 13., 26. The high degree of genetic homology among all 2009 H1N1 viruses from diverse geographic locations indicates that this was most likely a single (or small number of) cross-species introductions with rapid human dissemination.26 Although not the major HA subtype switch (shift) typical of the last 2 influenza pandemics, the level of antigenic mismatch of the swine-origin 2009 H1N1 virus with recently circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses likely contributed to the pandemic spread of the 2009 virus.",

In a series of 426 patients with 2009 H1N1 infection identified early in the pandemic in China, the mean age was 23 years, and nearly 94% of cases were in individuals 50 years or younger.28 Although the morbidity and mortality associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States have been modest even in comparison with many seasonal influenza years, more than 90% of cases and 87% of deaths related to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have been in those younger than 65 years, and the median age of patients who died was 26 years in 1 study.29\n",

The first 2 cases were detected within 2 collaborative enhanced surveillance networks established by the Department of Defense\u2019s Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Border Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project in California. When testing a new point-of-service diagnostic device, 2 nonsubtypable influenza A strains were identified from unrelated cases and subsequently confirmed to be identical swine-origin H1N1 viruses at CDC in April 2009.40 CDC promptly modified existing real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of the newly identified virus and disseminated details of the methodology on the World Health Organization (WHO) Web site.3., 41. Faix et al40 compared results of rapid influenza testing with those of the gold standard RT-PCR and found only 51% sensitivity with 99% specificity of the rapid test in detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus. The sensitivity of rapid test performance was equally poor for seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 (63% and 31%, respectively) compared with the PCR-based assay.40 In a small sample from Australia, lower respiratory tract samples were more likely than upper respiratory samples to be positive for 2009 H1N1 by RT-PCR in patients requiring mechanical ventilation; rapid antigen testing was positive in only 25% of such patients.42 Chan et al43 reported that the limits of detection of 5 antigen-based rapid tests were comparable for 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H1N1, suggesting there are similar limitations to the use of rapid tests in both seasonal and pandemic disease. RT-PCR tests remained positive for a median of 6 days in a study from China, but detection persisted for up to 17 days in some cases, most often in children younger than 14 years and those with a delay in antiviral therapy.28 Because the RT-PCR test was not commercially available for routine clinical laboratory use, many U.S. public health laboratories became overwhelmed with requests for the CDC-developed PCR diagnostics during the summer and fall of 2009, prompting CDC to later recommend reserving the molecular diagnostics for hospitalized influenza cases.",

An innovative zonal ultracentrifugation process was added (still requiring growth in embryonated eggs) in the 1960s to reduce egg-derived pyrogenic contaminants, and this inactivated influenza vaccine process remains the mainstay of influenza vaccine manufacturing in 2010.49 In the United States, classical reassortment is used to prepare the seed viruses for egg inoculation, a process that combines the HA and NA gene segments from the selected circulating influenza A strains with 6 other gene segments from a high-growth laboratory strain. The process can be protracted and unpredictable and may limit the options available for yearly strain selection and delay vaccine production and release. A cold-adapted, attenuated live influenza vaccine approved for use in the United States in individuals aged 2 to 50 years also uses reassortment of the HA and NA gene segments from yearly selected strains but, in this case, combined with 6 gene segments from a cold-adapted laboratory strain. Current seasonal influenza vaccines contain 2 influenza A strains (a seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 in recent years) and 1 influenza B strain.

The regulatory pathway selected for licensure of 2009 H1N1 vaccines was for manufacturers to request supplements to their seasonal influenza biologics license, similar to requesting a seasonal strain change. Use of this pathway required an identical manufacturing and quality testing process as that used for seasonal influenza vaccine production and did not require large scale clinical trials for immunogenicity. In contrast to the experience with previous major antigenic shift pandemics, the majority of adults and children aged 10 years and older responded to a single dose of unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines in immunogenicity studies.50 Monovalent, unadjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccines from 4 manufacturers (3 inactivated and 1 live attenuated) were licensed on September 15, 2009. Given uncertainties about the initial supply and demand for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations Practices issued recommendations that the following 5 targeted groups be given priority until vaccine availability increased: pregnant women, caretakers of infants less than 6 months, healthcare and emergency medical services personnel, persons aged 6 months to 24 years, and persons aged 25 to 64 years with high-risk medical conditions.51 Glaringly absent were the elderly, who despite bearing the major burden of seasonal influenza, had been relatively spared by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

The potential for shortages in the egg supply during a pandemic, particularly in the setting of a highly lethal avian influenza pandemic (eg, H5N1), adds further uncertainty to vaccine production. Given the continuous antigenic drift in interpandemic periods and the ever present threat of major pandemic antigenic shifts, modernization of the influenza vaccine process is of critical importance. Intensive research and regulatory commitment will be necessary to move forward with advances such as the utilization of reverse genetic techniques to produce seed viruses, evaluation of safe and effective adjuvants that reduce antigen requirements and development of alternatives to the current reliance on tens of millions of embryonated eggs for vaccine production.49\n",

An essential element in modeling the dynamics of an epidemic is the determination of the basic reproductive number, the R\n0, which predicts the number of new infections produced by 1 infected individual when the population is completely susceptible to infection (ie, no preexisting immunity and unvaccinated). Calculation of the R\n0 takes into account the average duration of infectiousness, the rate of contact of the primary case with susceptible individuals per unit time and the probability of transmission per contact.55., 57. An R\n0 of 3 indicates that a primary case of disease generates an average of 3 secondary cases in a susceptible population. Sustained transmission of a disease will not occur if R\n0 is 1 or less. Also, of importance in predicting the potential for spread of an epidemic is the time it takes for the index case to cause secondary infections (the generation time), which is relatively short for influenza, in the range of 2 to 3 days.57 The estimated R\n0 for previous influenza pandemics ranged from approximately 2.0 for the 1918 pandemic,56 1.89 for the 1968 \u201cHong Kong\u201d influenza and 1.5 to 1.7 for the 1957 \u201cAsian\u201d influenza pandemic.55 The 2009 H1N1 influenza had a R\n0 of approximately 1.5 in the first wave of disease.57\n",

City officials were not particularly alarmed when on September 17, 1918, the first civilian cases of H1N1 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d were identified in Philadelphia, a city with a population of approximately 1.75 million at the time. A Liberty Loan parade, designed to raise money for the war effort, was allowed to proceed on September 28, 1918, and attracted several hundred thousand spectators lining the streets over a 2-mile parade route.58., 59. Within days, influenza cases and deaths dramatically increased and followed an explosive course reaching a peak rate of weekly excess pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths of 257 per 100,000 by October 19, 1918.60 School closures and restrictions on public gatherings were not implemented until 16 days after recognition of the first influenza cases.58., 59., 60. In contrast, authorities in St. Louis, a city with a population of approximately 775,000 in 1918, moved quickly to institute social distancing 2 days after its first civilian influenza cases were recognized, and this Midwestern city experienced a peak weekly excess P&I death rate that was 88% lower and a cumulative excess P&I death rate that was approximately 50% lower than in Philadelphia.60 In an epidemic model of weekly mortality in 16 cities during the 1918 pandemic, nonpharmaceutical mitigation efforts reduced the mortality by an average range of 10% to 30%, but this impact was diminished when interventions were introduced too late or released too soon.61\n",

Pandemic infection control and prevention efforts in the healthcare setting, including guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment, produced vigorous debate regarding the quality of the scientific evidence on which the recommendations were based.64 As an example, the WHO recommended surgical masks be worn by healthcare workers for care of patients with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza, reserving N95 respirators with 0.3-\u03bc particle filtering capacity, for high-risk aerosol-generating procedures.65 In contract, CDC recommended fit-tested N95 respirator use by all healthcare workers with close contact with suspected 2009 H1N1 cases.66 The divergent recommendations were based on very limited evidence showing superior effectiveness of the N95 mask over surgical masks for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).67., 68. A recent report found effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators in seasonal influenza prevention to be similar in a study of 446 nurses working in emergency departments and hospital units in 8 tertiary care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, although healthcare worker infection rates were surprisingly high in both groups (23.6% and 22.9%, respectively).69 Given the limitations of the evidence, cost and availability of the N95 masks drove infection prevention decisions in many healthcare systems.

Human cases were detected promptly in April 2009, molecular diagnostics were developed in a matter of weeks and the methods made widely available, and the full sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 8 gene segments was electronically published on May 7, 2009.3 Seed viruses for vaccine development were quickly produced, and a mechanism for rapid vaccine licensure was agreed on.

Will there be further recombination events among cocirculating viruses in humans, swine or other mammalian hosts? Is a more lethal wave of disease yet to come?",

The global commitment to coordinated, collaborative and rapid international influenza response with appropriately applied mitigation efforts must be sustained. Many research and development needs have been defined, including the need to increase capacity for point-of-care influenza molecular diagnostics and the modernization of influenza vaccine development, manufacture and distribution. Additional work is needed to more rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, including specific personal protective equipment and social distancing interventions. Early access to effective antiviral therapy, advanced intensive care unit care and routine use of pneumococcal and Haemophilus vaccines in targeted populations are essential tools for prevention and treatment of the most severe seasonal and pandemic influenza disease and its complications. A global commitment to addressing the many challenges presented by the complex and ever changing influenza virus will assure that we never revisit the magnitude and devastation of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the 21st century.",
