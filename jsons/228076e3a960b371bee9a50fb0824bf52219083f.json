            "text": "Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) screws, typically selftapping, are easy and quick to use, seemingly safe, are compatible with plating systems, reduce buccal and gingival tissue trauma and are used to assist with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of fractured mandibles. 1 However, there is limited literature on complications that may arise with their use. 2 Hashemi and Parbiz 3 studied 373 screws in 73 patients and found that 6.5% of screws damaged dental roots, of which 13 teeth required further treatment or extraction. Coburn and colleagues 4 described complications in their 122 patient study including fracture of screws upon insertion and iatrogenic damage to teeth. Of the complications noted, firstly, the authors further report the risk of root damage as shown in the OPT following ORIF (Fig. 1) . The authors have also experienced failure at the IMF screw head-thread junction in (Fig. 2) , a complication also reported by Holmes 2 and Coburn 4 . Farr 5 postulated that screw fracture at this junction might be created by the screw being placed partly into root dentine which would then require more force to insert the screw due to greater resistance, whilst this is a view shared by the authors, we also propose that there can be, on occasion, mechanical weaknesses or faults at this junction. This unplanned separation may result in delays due to difficult intra-operative retrieval (if possible without further damage). The complications described have become more pertinent in the present climate, with greater reliance on IMF.",

            "text": "To avoid the problems outlined with IMF screws an alternative, in the form of MatrixWAVE TM MMF System, may be considered. This procedure can be performed under local anaesthetic. As compared to traditional wire fixation of an arch bar, the MatrixWAVE TM MMF System comprises a modified arch bar, which is secured with screw fixation. It also uses shorter self-tapping screws compared to IMF screws, because there are more placed across the arch. Lastly, when securing the MatrixWAVE TM MMF System screws, they are not inserted up to the screw head-thread junction, thus allowing more space for wire and elastics to be applied on to these, as well as the cleats on the arch bar, so allowing a more even and accurate distribution of force.",

Avoiding AGP's may help avoid general anaesthetic/intubation, hospital admission and exposure to potential COVID-19 viral infection, so reduce the stress on an already stretched system. In respect of fractured mandibles, both IMF screws and MatrixWAVE TM MMF System (or sim-ilar system), in particular, are proving more useful and a safer alternative for dentate mandibular fractures, at this time, but must be placed carefully.",
