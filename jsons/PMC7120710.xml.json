Mulder named this radical \u201cprotein\u201d after the Greek word proteios meaning \u201cof the first rank or position\u201d. This seems entirely appropriate, as it reflects the central importance of these large molecules in the function of living organisms.

Some very significant targets in major diseases such as cancer and arthritis can only be affected with large protein molecules, so the biopharmaceutical industry has been forced to take them seriously as drugs. Modern protein drugs fall into the following categories:\nHormone-like molecules, including those that stimulate the growth of blood cells after cancer therapyProtein decoys that mimic the drug target to prevent the natural protein from binding to the target, or that neutralised the drug target by removing it from the circulationAntibodies, normally produced by the immune system to fight infection, but which are instead directed against specific drug targets\n",

What they have in common, however, is a lack of oral availability, since they are both too large to pass through the stomach and are broken down by the digestive system. This means that they must be delivered into the circulation by injection or other means. Currently, over 12 billion injections are made annually, a figure that is likely to increase substantially as new drugs based on proteins and other large molecules are introduced to the marketplace. Much effort is being expended by the medical devices industry to find effective means of delivery that can be performed without either physical or psychological discomfort to the patient. Devices such as autoinjectors have made subcutaneous injection (sub cut) a fairly straightforward procedure for self injection, but attention is currently being focused on needle-free devices. These use high pressures to drive the protein through the skin; although this can cause more bruising than with using needles, the technology to improve this situation is being advanced all the time (Aroroa et al. 2007). Other delivery methods for proteins are being investigated, including transdermal patches, implants, intraocular administration, inhalation and even oral delivery, if the protein is small enough, using special carrier molecules.",

Once bound, this sequence signals the cell to break down the RNA at that point and thus stop the production of the protein specified by that gene.

This, however, is a highly specialised case in which the drug is injected directly into the eye in order to inhibit the replication of the CMV that provokes eye inflammation. Another Isis Pharmaceuticals product is the antisense molecule mipomersen; this lowers cholesterol in patients by reducing the levels of a key protein involved in the production of the so-called bad cholesterol (Akdim et al. 2010).

A newer technology, \u201csmall interfering RNA\u201d (siRNA), has emerged recently that appears to be more consistent and reliable than antisense. The phenomenon of RNA interference was demonstrated by Fire and Mello in animal cells in the late 1990s and led to its rapid adoption by the biomedical research community. In fact, the two scientists received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2006, which is a remarkably short time after their initial discoveries. siRNA is used in the same way as antisense and there are similarities between the two. For example, both types of nucleic acid force the breakdown of RNA specific for the gene of interest, have to be chemically modified to improve resistance to metabolism and must be introduced parenterally. The difference lies in the fact that siRNA is introduced as a double-stranded, rather than single-stranded oligonucleotide and is processed by the cell in a different way to that of antisense molecules. As a result of these differences, siRNA is more efficient in targeting specific genes and is being used worldwide in basic research and drug development. The biotech company Alnylam (in partnership with Cubist) has conducted early proof of principle trials with an inhaled siRNA drug designed to inhibit the RSV that infects patients who have received lung transplants. The results, although preliminary, are promising enough to support further clinical development of this novel type of drug (Zamora et al. 2010).",

These microRNAs (miRNAs) were discovered only in 2001, but have caught the attention of scientists because of their ability to regulate the expression of a large variety of genes in the body and through being implicated in a number of diseases, including cancer and infection. For example, when the hepatitis C virus enters the liver, miRNA 122 is produced by the infected cells and stimulates the production of more viruses. An inhibitor of this miRNA, itself a modified RNA molecule, has been shown to suppress the growth of the virus, so it could offer a new way of treating patients infected with hepatitis C (Lanford et al. 2010). It is sobering to reflect upon all the years that scientists, including myself, have concentrated on the larger RNA involved in producing proteins and in the process have literally thrown these smaller molecules down the sink without realising their importance.",

These are distressing genetic diseases that result from mutations (Latin mutare, to change) in a single gene. The number of people suffering from single gene defects, although significant, is much smaller than the number with major chronic diseases such as neurodegeneration or cancer. Therefore, in order to make gene therapy a mainstream objective of the biopharmaceutical industry, the technology must be applied to a broader range of diseases. One example is type I diabetes, where insulin-producing cells have been destroyed by the patient\u2019s own immune system. Gene therapy using a gene coding for insulin would allow the patient to make the protein in situ and, therefore, cure the diabetes.

If not enough DNA gets into the cells, there will not be enough protein expressed to compensate for the faulty version produced by the patient.

This is itself a DNA molecule, often based on the DNA found in viruses. This is because viruses have to infect human (or other) cells to make proteins from their own genes because they do not have the machinery to do this independently. The components of the virus that are used to infect cells can be purified in the laboratory and reassembled into a new virus containing the gene therapy DNA. This virus is then introduced into patients. In the process of creating the modified virus, any elements that might cause disease are removed. Sometimes, for example the components of the HIV are used, which is testimony to the confidence that scientists have in applying this technology to human subjects. Despite the efficiency of viral vectors, it has not been possible to completely eliminate their ability to provoke an immune response in the patient. This response may be a mild inflammation, or a fatal reaction (in a small number of cases), which has cast a shadow over the whole field of gene therapy. Another major problem arises when the viral nucleic acid literally integrates with the DNA in the patient\u2019s own cells and causes cancer. This happens because the new DNA switches on genes that are normally silenced in order to avoid inappropriate cell division.

For example, several children with immune deficiency caused by a single gene defect have been cured using gene therapy. Direct administration of genes into the eye has been shown to partially restore sight in patients with a particular form of congenital blindness. There are now over 1,000 clinical trials for gene therapy listed by the FDA, and many of these are being applied to cancer and other chronic diseases, rather than just rare conditions. This means that confidence in gene therapy is growing, although it will be some time (if ever) before it becomes a truly mainstream pharmaceutical product.",

            "text": "The immune system has evolved to provide protection against invading organisms and is divided into two main areas: innate and adaptive. The innate system is the first line of defence against attack by bacteria and viruses, but it has no memory of the encounter with these agents. The adaptive system is brought into play after the initial infection and reinforces the attack that, if successful, will clear the infection from the body. This is where antibodies and white blood cells called lymphocytes appear on the scene. The adaptive system retains a memory of the encounter so that a further infection will be cleared rapidly and efficiently, possibly some decades later. Until quite recently, the two arms of the immune system were seen to be separate entities; from an immunology researcher\u2019s point of view, the adaptive system was the most challenging and interesting and the innate system was frankly considered a bit boring. Times have changed, and the field has been energised with new discoveries about how the innate system recognises patterns of molecules on invading bacteria and viruses and how closely it is integrated with the adaptive system. This is highly relevant to vaccine research, since the adaptive arm is responsible for creating an \u201cimmunological memory\u201d to be activated upon later encounter with the infectious agent. Vaccines are made up of two components: an antigen combined with an adjuvant. Antigen is a general term for the agent that provokes an immune response. The adjuvant literally acts as a helper to enhance that response. This is particularly useful when then antigen alone may not be very immunogenic (i.e. does not provoke a strong immune response) and it also means that the amount of antigen per dose of vaccine can be kept to a minimum. Adjuvants work in part through stimulating the innate immune system, which in turn enhances the adaptive arm. This means that new findings about this aspect of immunology are being translated into a new generation of adjuvants with superior performance to existing molecules.",

            "text": "When microorganisms, such as a bacteria or viruses, infect the body, antibodies and lymphocyte responses are produced naturally to allow clearance of the invader. Vaccines fool the body into thinking that it is being invaded because they mimic the ability of the microorganism to stimulate an immune response, but without causing disease at the same time. In practice, the vaccine may be anything from a live attenuated virus, to fragments of viral or bacterial DNA.\nLive attenuated virus\nThis vaccine uses the organism that it is designed to protect against to create immunity without triggering disease. This means that the organism in the vaccine is diluted or attenuated. Recipients of these vaccines are inoculated, rather than immunised. Examples include measles and chickenpox vaccines\nInactivated vaccines\nThese are whole organisms that have been rendered uninfectious by treatment with heat or chemicals. The term \u201cinactivated\u201d applies to vaccines derived from viruses, while those from bacteria are known as \u201ckilled\u201d. Because these products are less potent than live vaccines, more has to be administered in each dose. Polio and hepatitis A vaccines are commonly used examples of this type, where the virus has been inactivated by formalin (formaldehyde) treatment\nToxoid vaccines\nCertain bacteria, such as tetanus, diphtheria and cholera bacteria, produce proteins called toxins that are responsible for the characteristic symptoms of these diseases. These proteins are purified from bacteria grown in culture and converted by formalin treatment into \u201ctoxoids\u201d that are devoid of harmful activity. These toxoids are used as vaccines in combination with adjuvants\nSubunit vaccines\nBacteria and viruses are very different in appearance and life cycle, yet both are covered with proteins that assist in gaining entry into human cells. Influenza viruses are a good example of this as they express two proteins, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which can be purified and used in combination as a vaccine. Antibodies generated against each of these proteins prevent the virus from entering the cells of the respiratory tract. Subunit vaccines can be purified from whole viruses or bacteria, or else produced in cell cultures using recombinant DNA technology. Some bacterial vaccines are based on surface carbohydrates (sugar-like molecules) instead of proteins\nDNA vaccines\nWhether the vaccine is based on whole organisms or subunits, the cost of manufacture and safety testing can be considerable. Stability of the product where there is no refrigeration can also be a problem. DNA vaccines offer a possible solution to this because they are relatively simple to produce and are quite stable. The idea for this approach to immunisation came from gene therapy, where it was noticed that DNA could provoke an immune response, which could be exploited in vaccination, rather than just be dismissed as a side effect. DNA vaccination requires the same kind of vector as that used for gene therapy and is introduced into the body by injection or the lungs by aerosol. If the DNA is designed to code for a protein normally found in a subunit vaccine, it will produce it directly in the human tissues and provoke an immune response. DNA vaccines are being evaluated in early clinical trials for, amongst other things, influenza H5N1 (Smith et al. 2010) and cancer.\n",

            "text": "It may seem surprising that whole cells are being considered as pharmaceutical products to be sold in the same way as small molecules. This is because of the excitement generated over stem cells and the possibility of repairing damaged tissue by injecting these cells into patients (regenerative medicine). The human body contains roughly 200 different cell types (see 10.1007/978-1-4419-9902-3_5) and yet originates from only one cell, i.e. the fertilised egg (ovum). This means that there must be some process operating during development of the embryo (and later the adult) that generates these different cell types. This process relies on pluripotent stem cells in the embryo which turn into different cell types, such as nerve, muscle and blood, during the course of development. Adult stem cells replenish mature cells that have a limited lifespan, such as blood and skin cells, and are present throughout life. Since many Western diseases can result in permanent tissue damage, any therapeutic approach that reverses or repairs the damage is going to be of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry, hence their involvement in stem cell research. In fact, stem cell therapy is not new; bone marrow transplantation to restore normal blood has been performed for decades. In the case of leukaemia, for example, blood stem cells are purified from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous), or a normal donor (allogeneic), and can be stored outside the body, during which time radio- and chemotherapy are used to remove all blood cells, including the leukaemia. The non-cancerous stem cells are then reintroduced into the body, where they divide and repopulate the blood. Although these procedures are hazardous and often used as a last resort, they do open up the possibility of using gene therapy to introduce specific genes into the blood of patients by modifying the stem cells used in transplantation. Clinical trials are underway that use this approach for a number of blood diseases, including AIDS.",
