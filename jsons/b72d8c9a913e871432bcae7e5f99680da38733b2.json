Interestingly, of the 12 patients that Ashbaugh and colleagues described in that article, 4 of the 12 were aged 19 years or younger and may have been managed in pediatric critical care units today. That initial description has since evolved into the American European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition in 1994 and then the current Berlin definition of ARDS for adults and the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) definition of pediatric ARDS (PARDS) [2] [3] [4] . Throughout these iterations, much attention continues to be paid toward understanding what conditions place patients at particular risk for ARDS development and what conditions contribute to worse ARDS clinical outcomes.

As the last 30 years have yielded important understanding into the pathobiology of ARDS/PARDS (see Chap. 3), so too have biological markers (aka biomarkers) and markers associated with genetic risk of ARDS/PARDS come to the forefront. Finally, discussions of ARDS/PARDS risk factors must inevitably dissect out whether the risk factors are associated with the development of ARDS/PARDS, and thereby factors impacting those patients at risk of ARDS/PARDS development, as well as those factors associated with better or worse clinical outcome once ARDS/ PARDS has been established.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Risk Factors and Etiologies of Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"text": "Finally, much of this work has now demanded that both clinicians and researchers refine our discourse to further acknowledge that, as a syndrome, certain subgroups of patients, oft termed endotypes or sub-phenotypes, must exist that ultimately can be at inherently greater risk of disease and/or have unique pathophysiological responses that may make these subgroups of patients more or less able to respond to certain treatment strategies. Accordingly, prognostic risk factors describe factors associated with subgroups of patients at inherently greater risk of ARDS/PARDS, whereas predictive risk factors identify subgroups of patients that are at greater/ lesser likelihood of responding to certain treatment strategies based on inherent differences in their underlying pathophysiologic responses to illness/injury. This chapter is intended to address all the areas outlined previously.

These patients had proportionally more infections as the etiology of the ARDS and had worse outcomes, including higher ICU and hospital mortality. In pediatrics, much of the early data on immunodeficiency came from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most recently, Dr. Kitchin and colleagues published their experience in 90 children with HIV admitted to the PICU in South Africa meeting AECC criteria in 2008-2009 in which the authors identify high rates of opportunistic infections (33% with P. jirovecii, 38% with cytomegalovirus) and overall 30% mortality [11] . Another significant population with immune dysfunction is patients with cancer or immunosuppression related to chemotherapy. In the Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome Incidence and Epidemiology study (PARDIE), 8% of all PARDS patients were identified as having cancer and 13% had immune suppression [12] . The outcomes for the groups were a disheartening 51% and 46% mortality, respectively. Dr. Rowan and colleagues have focused on the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients in the ICU (see Chap. 15) . Their work has shown that HSCT patients who have respiratory failure often meet PARDS criteria (91% in the first week of mechanical ventilation) and their disease is often severe, with longer ventilation courses and increased mortality [13, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 184, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 909, "end": 913, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1230, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1452, "text": "Chap. 15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1695, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1699, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunodeficiency"}, {"text": "There seems to be an interesting interplay between ARDS and body habitus in both adults and children. Results from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that 3.5% of children and adolescents in the United States are underweight and 31.8% are overweight or obese [15, 16] . Both represent states of malnutrition and are known to be associated with a variety of comorbidities. Increasing BMI has been shown to be independently associated with increased risk of ARDS development. Further, while underweight adults with ARDS have high rates of mortality, obese individuals, particularly those with established ARDS, require longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays (LOS), but exhibit the lowest risk of in-hospital mortality when compared to other weight categories [17] . This has come to be known as the \"obesity paradox.\" This \"obesity paradox\" has been reported in adults with sepsis or ARDS [18] . Obese individuals, who exhibit chronic inflammation and endothelial activation, surprisingly have reduced systemic inflammatory response with ARDS compared to those of normal weight [19] , suggesting a possible protective attenuation of the immune response to critical illness [19] . In a cohort of 330 subjects, Ward and colleagues found that 28% of PARDS patients were obese, and the obesity paradox was observed in those whose PARDS was due to systemic illness [20] .

However, adult ARDS has been clearly shown to be affected by cigarette smoking, so it is not unreasonable to think that environmental smoke exposure could affect PARDS. In the adult ARDS population, Dr. Calfee and colleagues demonstrated that cigarette smoking by history and a biomarker of smoke exposure, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, were each associated with the development of ARDS in patients with sepsis [21] . Impaired fluid clearance, epithelial and endothelial effects, and immune modulation could all underlie this effect [21] . In an allied study, Reilly and colleagues studied 996 critically ill adult trauma patients in conjunction with air quality metrics in the 6 weeks prior to presentation. Interestingly, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter <2.5 micrometers over the 6 weeks were significantly associated with ARDS development [22] .

Nonetheless, epidemiologic studies to date do not consistently endorse differential PARDS outcomes based on age, with some suggesting increasing risk with older age, but most studies suggesting no association of age with PARDS outcome [7, 9] .

Adult studies suggest increased risk of death in some African American and Hispanic ARDS cohorts [28] and differential response to treatments, as was determined post hoc in the NIH-funded Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial [29] . Pediatric studies of PARDS patients, likely because of limited study size, have not consistently observed increased risk within racial or ethnic groups either. While the PARDIE study results did not indicate increased risk of death across different racial groups, mortality was significantly higher in Hispanic cohorts (24.4%) compared with non-Hispanic patients (14.8%) or those with other ethnicity (14.4%, p = 0.013) [12] . Finally, these studies do not address the racial or ethnic impact on the risks of development of ARDS or PARDS, which may have an entirely different risk profile and may better be studied from a genetic risk perspective. As an example, Dahmer and colleagues have determined genetic polymorphisms in the genes of factors involved in the splicing cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator conductance associated with increased risk of pneumoniaassociated PARDS development in African American and non-Hispanic Caucasian children [30] .

That said, genomic approaches offer promising opportunities to identify novel mechanistic pathways of disease that may offer pharmacologic or other therapeutic targets in the future. Certainly, as latent class analytic strategies identify sub-phenotypes of ARDS patients with differential risk of response to therapy or distinct clinical outcomes, investigations of genetic variants may offer areas of common biology within sub-phenotypes or may identify previously unidentified sub-phenotypes. To date, although multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified with some association to ARDS risk, almost all studies have been done in adults. Not surprisingly, reproducibility has been problematic. The most notable functional variants identified to date are variants encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and surfactant protein B (SFTPB), with the most potentially pharmacologically targetable SNPs identified to date being angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) [31] . To confirm the functional significance of dysregulated coagulation in contributing to worse outcome in ARDS, genetic studies from patients enrolled in the adult ARDSnet Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial reported that genetic variants in thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor genes were independently associated with mortality, independent of treatment trial allocation [32] . The finding that the IL1RN coding variant is associated with decreased risk of ARDS in adults supports the understanding that IL-1beta and other IL-1 pathway cytokines are causally implicated in ARDS risk [33] . However, in a study of 549 children with acute respiratory failure, Dahmer and colleagues were unable to identify genetic variants in the IL-1 pathway genes that were associated with PARDS [34] . Initiated in 2012, NHLBI hosted an exome sequencing project that includes an investigation of 45,000 SNPs from the exomes of adults with ARDS and healthy controls. Through this project, the regulatory gene arylsulfatase D (ASRD) was identified to be present in 22% of adults with ARDS and 4% of controls, and a protein coding gene, XK Kell blood group complex member 3 (XKR3), was present with a minor allele frequency of 37% in ARDS patients and 4% of controls [35] .

The common pathway of vascular permeability and fluid leak that often underlies ARDS follows.

A large study by the Practice of Ventilation in critically ill adults without ARDS at onset of ventilation (PRoVENT) study group attempted to identify these factors [63] . This international, multicenter cohort study identified patients undergoing mechanical ventilation who were at risk of ARDS defined as a Lung Injury Prevention Score of 4 or higher.

A noted limitation of this study as well as other efforts to prevent ARDS is the large number of patients who have ARDS at the time of intubation [64] . Raymondos and colleagues tested whether outcomes differed between ARDS patients managed at German university and nonuniversity hospitals and found a survival benefit in patients treated at university hospital [65] . Differences were seen in the use of higher FiO 2 , lower PEEP, and higher driving pressure in the nonuniversity hospitals at the time of the study. Interestingly, this finding corroborates that of Noah et al. from 2011 wherein transfer to an ECMO center, even if the patient was then not cannulated for ECMO, conferred a survival benefit for those adults with H1N1-associated ARDS compared to matched non-ECMO referred patients [66] .

Genetic Variation and Biomarkers in Children with Acute Lung Injury (BALI; R01HL095410) was a prospective ancillary study to the multisite clinical trial, Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure (RESTORE; U01 HL086622) (22) . BALI was designed to examine the association of specific plasma protein and genetic biomarkers with PARDS among prospectively enrolled children with acute respiratory failure.

A total of 69% of the patients (n = 378) met the criteria for PARDS and 83% of children (n = 312) with PARDS met criteria on the day of intubation (study day 0); another 11% (n = 42) met criteria on study day 1, and the remaining 6% met criteria on study days 2-5. The level of plasma IL-1ra was significantly greater at intubation through day 3 in those with PARDS compared with those without PARDS (p < 0.0001).

Additional data from BALI related to other markers of inflammation, plasma surfactant protein measurement, and markers of dysregulated coagulation are forthcoming. Despite this work and although RESTORE enrolled patients with acute respiratory failure, approximately 90% of patients meeting PARDS criteria did so within the first day of RESTORE enrollment, thereby again limiting the opportunity to find biomarkers that can be measured prior to PARDS onset and within a time frame to allow clinicians to use these marker measurements to initiate preventative therapies.
