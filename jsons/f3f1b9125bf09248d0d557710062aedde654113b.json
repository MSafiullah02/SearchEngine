Derived from the Greek and meaning to eat (\"phagy\") oneself (\"auto\"), the term autophagy refers to a lysosomal pathway of selfdigestion, involving dynamic membrane rearrangement to sequester cargo for delivery to the lysosome, where the sequestered material is degraded and recycled. For decades, it has been known that autophagy is the primary intracellular catabolic mechanism for the degradation and recycling of longlived cellular proteins and organelles. For decades, it has also been known that the recycling function of autophagy is an important adaptive response to nutrient deprivation and other forms of environmental stress. However, only recently have we discovered that autophagy may also be an important mechanism for the degradation of intracellular pathogens and that autophagy may also be important in cellular protection against the stress of microbial infection. Not surprisingly, we have also recently learned that some successful intracellular pathogens have devised strategies either to block host autophagy or to subvert the host autophagic process to foster their own replication. In this chapter, we will review recent progress in understanding the interrelationships between viruses, autophagy, and innate immunity (Figures 1 & 2) . ",

The field has expanded considerably within the last 15 years after the cloning and molecular characterization of the yeast AuTophagGy (ATG)related genes (reviewed in 7 ) . The analysis of sequenced genomes of higher eukaryotes has identified ATG homologues in mammals, C. elegans, Drosophila, Dictyostelium, and plants, and many of these genes have been shown to be essential for autophagy function in higher eukaryotes (reviewed in 2 ) ( Table 1 ). In addition to the identification of the autophagy genes, significant progress has been made in the past decade in understanding some of the signaling events that regulate autophagy (reviewed in 8, 9 ) . Interestingly, some of the signaling molecules that regulate autophagy, as well as some of the autophagy genes, play a role in the host antiviral innate immune response (Table 1, Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "The initial step of autophagy is the formation and elongation of the isolation membrane. The isolation membrane invaginates and sequesters cytoplasmic constituents including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ribosomes, and the edges of the membrane fuse with each other to form a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses to the lysosome/vacuole with subsequent delivery of the inner vesicle or autophagic body into the lumen of the degradative compartment. The source of the autophagosomal membrane is still unclear, but presently, it is thought that the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) acts as the site of vesicle formation during autophagy [10] [11] [12] . The PAS is thought to form de novo, but the source of the vesicle membrane is not known. It seems likely that the \"typical\" autophagosomes observed during viral infection that contain a mix of virions and self-cytoplasmic constituents, originate from the PAS. However, it is not yet known whether the PAS also serves as the site of vesicle formation for the formation of \"atypical\" autophagic-like double-membrane vesicles that function as replication sites for certain RNA viruses (e.g. poliovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, equine arterivirus) (reviewed in 13 ). More likely, these double-membrane vesicles arise directly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 13 .",

The composition and abundance of proteins sequestered within autophagosomes reflects the relative composition and abundance of proteins in the surrounding cytoplasm 14 . This observation has led to the concept that autophagosomes indiscriminately sequester cytoplasmic content. However, in yeast, there are well-established pathways of specific autophagy, including the biosynthetic cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway and pexophagy (reviewed in 15 ), and in mammalian cells, mitochondria-specific autophagy has been reported 16 . Although molecular determinants of cargo recognition have been identified in yeast pathways of specific autophagy, virtually nothing is known about the specificity of cargo recognition in higher eukaryotes. In circumstances where there is degradation of viruses observed inside \"typical\" autophagosomes that also contain cellular constituents, the sequestration step may lack specificity. However, in circumstances where viruses utilize components of the autophagic machinery for the formation of \"autophagic-like\" double-membrane structures that exclusively contain viral constituents, the sequestration step is likely to have exquisite specificity. The identification of the viral and cellular determinants of this specificity will be an important advance in understanding the cell biology of these types of RNA virus infections and may eventually lead to the identification of novel antiviral therapeutic targets.",

The recently defined evolutionarily conserved role of the eIF2 kinase signaling pathway in autophagy induction suggests that autophagy regulation may contribute to the antiviral function of the interferon-inducible eIF2 kinase, PKR. PKR and other eIF2 kinases induce a general translational arrest by phosphorylating the serine 51 residue of eIF2 (reviewed in 17 ) . Genetic studies in yeast and mammalian cells have also shown that the eIF2 kinase signaling pathway is required for starvation and herpes simplex virus-induced autophagy 18 . While further analyses are required to dissect the relative contributions of autophagy induction vs. translational arrest in mediating the antiviral effects of PKR, these findings link a new cellular function (i.e. autophagy) with interferon signaling.",

As will be discussed below, given the evidence for a role of autophagy in innate immunity, it is likely that viruses have evolved different strategies to antagonize host f f autophagy, which, at least in the case of herpes simplex virus (see Sections 4.1 and 5) include the targeting of upstream autophagy regulatory signals f 18 .

In view of recent evidence supporting a role of autophagy in tumor suppression [23] [24] [25] [26] , the presence of these genes in retroviral genomes could contribute to oncogenesis at least, in part, through inhibition of autophagy signaling, as well as through modulation of other downstream pathways.",

The role of some of the Atg proteins, including ones that act in the lipid kinase signaling complex and in the ubiquitin-like conjugation pathways, has been studied in plant and mammalian viral infections (see Table 1 ).",

One of the first ATG genes identified in yeast, ATG1, encodes a serine/threonine kinase 28 . The Atg1 kinase maintains a weak interaction with a hyperphosphorylated Atg protein, Atg13, in nutrientrich conditions. Upon starvation conditions or stress, Atg13 is dephosphorylated resulting in a tighter association with Atg1 29 . Atg13 binding is essential for autophagy since atg13 mutants unable to bind to Atg1 are completely defective in autophagy 29 . Atg17, which is also thought to play a role in Atg1 activation, also interacts with Atg1 29 . Downstream targets of Atg1 have not been identified, although Atg1 interacts with other proteins independently of its kinase activity 30 . The upstream kinase, Tor (target of rapamycin), indirectly or directly results in Atg13 hyperphosphorylation, which is one presumptive mechanism by which Tor kinase inhibits autophagy. Of note, the Atg1 component of the yeast autophagy induction complex plays a conserved role in autophagy in higher eukaryotes. However, as-of-yet, the role of Atg1 in antiviral immunity has not been evaluated.",

The conjugation modification of Atg proteins is necessary for the formation of an autophagosome of appropriate size and shape 41 . However, the precise molecular functions of the conjugation reactions are not known and remain a critical unanswered question in autophagy research. The first conjugation system involves the lipidation of Atg8, a ubiquitinlike protein whose close mammalian homologues have three-dimensional structures very similar to ubiqutin [42] [43] [44] [45] . Both Atg8 and the mammalian homomlogue LC3 are cleaved post-translationally by the cysteine endopeptidase Atg4 46, 47 . The cleavage of Atg8/Lc3 is essential for conjugation and further maturation of the autophagosomes 48 .

Several decades ago, starvation was noted to be a potent inducer of autophagy in rodent liver (reviewed in 57 ), leading to the hypothesis that autophagy is an adaptive response to starvation. Following the identification of the conserved autophagy genes, genetic studies in different species have confirmed that autophagy genes are required for the maintenance of eukaryotic life in the face of limited environmental nutrient supply. This principle was first demonstrated in yeast, i.e. all ATG gene mutant yeasts grow normally in nutrient rich conditions, but unlike wild-type yeasts, die rapidly during carbon or nitrogen starvation 28 . Similarly, Dictyostelium discoideum that lack ATG genes also grow normally in the presence of their food, nonpathogenic bacteria, but die rapidly when subjected to starvation 58, 59 . During nitrogen or starvation, atg7 and atg9 mutant plants display two phenotypes that are thought to result from a defective ability to mobilize nutrients through autophagic delivery, including enhanced chlorosis (yellowing of leaves due to a loss of chlorophyll) and accelerated leaf senescence 60, 61 . In addition, mammalian cells deleted of the autophagy genes, atg5 or beclin 1, also undergo accelerated cell death in response to starvation as compared to their wild-type counterparts 62 .",

Even in the absence of this postulated arm of PKR signaling, the mere recycling of nutrients in virus-infected cells would be predicted to have a beneficial function for the host. Although few studies have compared cellular amino acid pools during nutrient starvation and virus infection, acute viral replication involves the parasitism of not only the host cell's translational machinery, but also the host cell's translational building blocks. Therefore, it seems likely that acute viral replication induces what can be thought of as a state of \"pseuodostarvation\". According to this model, the prediction is that the nutrient recycling function of autophagy plays a similar protective function during viral infection as it plays during nutrient deprivation.",

Genetic studies have revealed an essential role for components of the autophagic machinery in differentiation and developmental processes in several different organisms, including sporulation in yeast, multicellular development in Dictyostelium, dauer development in C. elegans, and embryonic development in mice (reviewed in 2 ). In addition, the mammalian autophagy gene, beclin 1, appears to play a role in epithelial cell differentiation, since the mammary glands in beclin 1 heterozygous-deficient mice display striking morphological abnormalities 23 . Since viral gene products can inhibit the autophagy function of Beclin 1 (see below) and potentially other autophagy proteins 65 , it is possible that autophagy blockade represents a mechanism by which viruses can affect cellular differentiation. For example, the Bcl-2-like BHRF1 protein encoded by EBV binds to Beclin 1 39 blocks its autophagy function 39 , and also perturbs epithelial cell differentiation 66 . Further studies are needed to determine the role of Beclin 1 binding in the perturbation of epithelial cell differentiation by BHRF1, as well as to investigate the effects of other viral inhibitors of autophagy on cellular differentiation and multicellular development.",

The beclin 1 gene is monallelically deleted in a high percentage of cases of human breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer (reviewed in 78 ) and has tumor suppressor function in cultured mammary carcinoma cells 79, 80 . Heterozygous disruption of beclin 1 in mice increases the frequency of spontaneous tumorigenesis (including papillary lung carcinomas, B cell lymphomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas) and accelerates the development of hepatitis B virus-induced pre-malignant lesions 23, 24 . In addition, atg5 null ES cells are more tumorigenic in mice than their wild-type counterparts and result in teratomas that are less welldifferentiated 81 . Together, these findings lead to the concept that autophagy genes may represent a novel class of tumor suppressor genes and that genetic disruption of autophagy may represent a novel mechanism of tumorigenesis. As will be discussed in more detail below, two different classes of viral gene products have been identified thus far that bind to Beclin 1 and inhibit its autophagy function, including the alphaherpesvirus-encoded neurovirulence protein, HSV-1 ICP34.5, and the gammaherpesvirus-encoded Bcl-2-like proteins, KSHV vBcl-2 and EBV BHRF1 38, 39 . The gammaherpesviruses are oncogenic viruses that are etiologically linked to a variety of different malignancies, including lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. At present, the precise role of gammaherpesvirus Bcl-2like proteins in viral oncogenesis is uncertain. Nonetheless, given the welldefined role of cellular Bcl-2 in oncogenesis and the emerging evidence that Beclin 1 is a tumor suppressor protein, it will be important to evaluate whether viral Bcl-2 antagonism of Beclin 1 function plays a role in gammaherpesvirus oncogenesis. Of note, preliminary data indicates that KSHV may also encode other gene products that interact with other components of the autophagic machinery 65 . Thus, oncogenic gammaherpesviruses may have multiple mechanisms to disarm host autophagy. It will be of interest to determine whether other oncogenic DNA viruses, especially human papillomavirus, also directly inhibit the host autophagic machinery.",

The conserved effects of protein caloric restriction (a dietary inducer of autophagy) on lifespan extension has provided further fuel for this concept (reviewed in 83 ). Recent genetic studies, especially those performed in C. elegans, provide more direct evidence for a role of both autophagy regulatory signals and components of the autophagic machinery in anti-aging pathways. Loss-offunction mutations in autophagy-inhibitory insulin-like signaling pathway extend lifespan (reviewed in 84 ) , and inactivation of the C. elegans ortholog of yeast autophagy gene, ATG6/VPS30, blocks this lifespan extension 20 .",

Viral infections, as well as the inflammatory response to viral infections, can damage mitochondria and/or increase the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, and these effects may contribute to viral pathogenesis. For example, the mitochondrial damage that occurs in HIV infection (even in the absence of antiretroviral treatment) is thought to be a major contributory factor to the metabolic abnormalities and cardiomyopathy that occur in patients with AIDS (reviewed in 85 ). As another example, in a transgenic mouse model of hepatitic C virus (HCV) infection, oxidative stress in the absence of inflammation has been implicated in HCV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis 86 . Similarly, studies in transgenic mice and cultured cells indicate that pre-S1/S2 mutant hepatitis B virus surface antigens, which accumulate in late stages of HBV infection, cause oxidative stress and DNA damage 87 . Therefore, it is possible that the mechanisms by which autophagy functions as an anti-aging pathway may be relevant to potential roles that autophagy may play in protecting cells against adverse sequelae of oxidative stress during virus infection.",

Although both of these roles may be operative in different diseases or even in different facets of a single disease, recent studies provide compelling evidence that autophagy plays a protective role against the toxic effects associated with protein aggregation. For example, mutant -synuclein (associated with early onset Parkinson's disease), and aggregate-prone proteins with polyglutamine expansions (associated with Huntington's disease) are targeted for autophagic degradation 88, 89 . Rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy, not only enhances the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins but also reduces the appearance of the aggregates and the cell death associated with expression of mutant Huntington's proteins 89 . Furthermore, induction of autophagy with rapamycin protects against neurodegeneration in both a fly and mouse model of Huntington's disease 90 .",

Similar to genetic neurodegenerative disorders, there is increasing evidence that murine retrovirus-associated spongiform-like neuronal degeneration is also associated with protein misfolding and ER stress. For example, viral envelope proteins from avirulent strains are processed normally and fail to induce ER stress, whereas envelope proteins from neurovirulent strains are misfolded and activate ER stress response pathways [93] [94] [95] . In addition, it has been proposed that the mechanism by which pre-S mutant HBV surface antigens promote oxidative stress and DNA damage is through the accumulation of misfolded mutant proteins and activation of ER stress 87, 96 . Thus, based on recent studies with non-viral associated neurodegenerative disorders, the prediction is that autophagy induction might be beneficial in attenuating diseases associated with misfolded viral proteins, such as retrovirus-associated spongiform encephalopathy and hepatitis B virusinduced liver damage. As a corollary, the possibility that these viruses might possess mechanisms to evade host autophagy could be an exacerbating factor in the pathogenesis of these infections.",

PKR activation leads to phosphorylation of the subunit of eukaryotic initiation factors 2 (eIF2 ) and a subsequent shutdown of host and viral protein synthesis and viral replication (reviewed in 100 ). To avoid this translational shutdown, many viruses have evolved different strategies to antagonize PKR function. These include interference with the dsRNA-mediated activation of PKR or PKR dimerization; blockade of the kinase catalytic site or PKR-f substrate interactions; alterations in the levels of PKR; direct regulation of eIF2 phosphorylation; and effects on components downstream of eIF2 (reviewed in 100,101 ). The importance of viral antagonism of PKR function in viral pathogenesis has been most clearly demonstrated using a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) model system 102, 103 . The HSV-1 neurovirulence protein, ICP34.5, binds to protein phosphatase 1 and causes it to dephosphorylate eIF2 , thereby negating the activity of PKR 104, 105 . A neuroattenuated HSV-1 mutant lacking ICP34.5 exhibits wild-type replication and virulence in mice genetically lacking pkr 103 , proving that the ICP34.5 gene product mediates neurovirulence by antagonizing PKRdependent functions.",

As mentioned above, molecules in the yeast eIF2 kinase signaling pathway (e.g. the eIF2 kinase, Gcn2, the eIF2 Ser51 residue, and the transcriptional transactivator, Gcn4) are required for nitrogen starvationinduced autophagy. Interestingly, the autophagy defect of gcn2 null yeast can be rescued by mammalian pkr transformation 18 . Direct evidence that viruses can induce PKR-dependent autophagy has been provided by studies done with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in genetically engineered MEFs 18 . A herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) mutant virus lacking the ICP34.5 inhibitor of PKR signaling (termed HSV-1 34.5), but not wild-type HSV-1, is able to induce the autophagic breakdown of long-lived cellular proteins in wild-type MEFs. However, HSV-1 34.5 infection is not able to induce the autophagic breakdown of long-lived cellular proteins in MEFs lacking pkr or with a nonphosphorylatable mutation in Ser-51 of eIF2 . These findings indicate the PKR-dependent signaling events regulate the autophagic breakdown of host proteins during viral infection and that this function of PKR is antagonized by the HSV-1 ICP34.5 neurovirulence gene product. As discussed in section 3.1, the breakdown of cellular proteins may help protect host cells against the effects of \"pseudostarvation\" induced by viral infection.",

In wild-type cells infected with wild-type HSV-1, the majority of intracytoplasmic virions are a either randomly dispersed in the cytoplasm or are contained within \"viral vacuoles,\" a structure thought to represent an important intermediate in the egress of HSV-1 from the nucleus out of the cell 106 .

HSV-1 protein degradation is significantly accelerated in wild-type MEFs infected with HSV-1 t t 34.5 as compared to wild-type MEFs infected with wild-type HSV-1, indicating that ICP34.5 delays viral protein degradation. However, in autophagy-deficient pkr -/-MEFs or eIF2 S51A mutant MEFs, the rate of HSV-1 protein degradation is similar in HSV-1-and HSV-1 34.5-infected cells, indicating that HSV-1 protein degradation is positively regulated by the PKR signaling pathway. Thus, the eIF2 kinase-dependent autophagy signaling pathway not only regulates the degradation of long-lived cellular proteins but also regulates the degradation of viral proteins. Accordingly, it seems logical to speculate that PKR-dependent autophagic degradation of viruses inhibits viral replication and is an antiviral defense mechanism. However, the relative contributions of the effects of PKR on viral protein synthesis and the effects of PKR on viral protein degradation in the regulation of the HSV-1 replication have not yet been assessed. For this purpose, it will be necessary to selectively inhibit the autophagic protein degradation machinery and/or have HSV-1 mutant viruses that selectively block specific downstream functions regulated by PKR. It will also be important to determine whether PKR-dependent autophagy degrades and inhibits the replication of viruses other than HSV-1. Preliminary observations indicate that PKR-dependent autophagy does lead to the degradation of another neurotropic virus, the enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus genus, Sindbis virus 107 ( Figure 4B ).",

The mechanisms by which autophagy genes exert protective effects in Sindbis virus infection are not yet known. Presumably, the autophagic breakdown of viral components leads to decrease viral yields. However, it is also possible that autophagy leads to the breakdown of cellular components required for viral replication. As noted above, the protective effects against cell death may be secondary to inhibitory effects on viral replication. Alternatively, the protective effects may relate to the nutrient recycling functions or \"damage control\" functions of autophagy, or in the case of beclin 1, to interactions between autophagy proteins and antiapoptotic pathways. It is also possible that autophagy may protect against cell death by degrading specific viral proteins (e.g. the Sindbis virus E1 and E2 envelope glycoprotein's 109 ) that are involved in triggering the apoptotic pathway.",

While the primary basis for this view has been morphologic correlations between the presence of autophagic vacuoles and dying cells (reviewed in 2,111 ), recent genetic experiments establish a more direct role for autophagy genes in certain types of programmed cell death. Mammalian Atg7 and beclin 1 RNAi blocks cell death in fibroblast and macrophage cell lines treated with the caspase inhibitor, zVAD 112 , and atg 6 , 7 , and 12 RNAi blocks salivary gland destruction during Drosophila development 113 . Thus, the relationship between autophagy, cell survival, and cell death is quite complex and likely varies according to the cell type and the specific physiological or pathophysiological setting.

            "text": "A tobacco mosaic virus infection model has recently been used to study the role of autophagy genes in plant innate immunity. During tobacco mosaic virus infection, the hypersensitive response is triggered by tobacco mosaic virus protein, TMV p50, which is the helicase domain of the viral replicase 117 . TMV p50 is recognized by an R protein (called the N protein) of N. benthamiana, which is composed of a Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain, a nucleotide binding domain, and a leucine-rich repeat domain 118 . Therefore, in tobacco plants containing the N protein (N ( ( +/+ N N ), there is local cell death in cells that are either infected with TMV or that express the TMV p50 protein but no systemic illness is observed. BECLIN 1 silencing in N +/+ N N tobacco plants reveals a striking role for this autophagy gene in limiting the spread of cell death during the hypersensitive response 40 . During TMV infection of N N plants, cell death begins as discreet and defined foci but continues to spread beyond the site of TMV infection until there is death of the entire inoculated leaf and other uninoculated leaves. A similar spreading cell death phenotype is seen with local expression of the TMV p50 protein, suggesting that the cell death occurs in response to a specific signal triggered by the pathogen encoded avirulence protein, and is not due to increased TMV replication or altered virus movement. In addition, in plants that lack the N gene, BECLIN 1 silencing does not lead to cell death after TMV infection. Moreover, BECLIN 1 silencing also results in spreading cell death during the hypersensitive response triggered by bacterially-encoded pathogen avirulence proteins. Together, these observations demonstrate that the spreading cell death phenotype in BECLIN 1-silenced plants is mediated by R gene-mediated innate immune responses and that BECLIN 1 is an important negative regulator of cell death during the plant innate immune response.",

As discussed in Section 2.3.3, PI3-K/Vps34 is a protein that physically interacts with Atg6/Beclin 1 in yeast and mammals and is essential for proper autophagosome formation. Interestingly, silencing of the plant class III PI-3K/VPS34 in N +/+ N N plants results in a spreading cell death phenotype during TMV infection that is similar to that observed with BECLIN 1 silencing. As discussed in Section 2.3.3, yeast and mammalian ATG3 and ATG7 are essential for conjugation reactions needed for autophagosome formation, and d silencing of the plant homologues of these genes also results in a spreading cell death phenotype after TMV infection. Thus, multiple different f f autophagy genes, including those that act in the vesicle nucleation stage (e.g. t BECLIN 1, Class III PI3-K/VPS34) and those that act in the vesicle expansion stage (e.g. ATG3 and ATG7) are necessary to prevent the spread of cell death during the plant innate immune response.",

One possibility is that the absence of autophagy genes in uninfected cells somehow modifies the R gene-mediated signal transduction pathway in a way that instructs uninfected cells to die.

Since ICP34.5 binds to Beclin 1 via a domain that is distinct from its PP1 -binding domain, it should be possible to construct HSV-1 viruses containing mutations in ICP34.5 that help differentiate between the role of PP1 -binding (and eIF2 phosphorylation) and the role of Beclin 1-binding in HSV-1 ICP34.5-mediated neurovirulence.",

For example, vaccinia virus E3, influenza virus NS1, HSV-1 Us11, reovirus 3, and rotavirus NSP3 encode double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding proteins that prevent PKR activation. Adenovirus VAI RNAs and HIV Tar RNAs bind to dsRNA substrates and inhibit PKR. Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein inhibits the dimerization of PKR, and influenza virus recruits a cellular protein, P58 IPK , that directly interacts with PKR and inhibits its dimerization. The vaccinia virus K3L, hepatitis C virus E2, and HIV Tat proteins act as pseudosubstrates of PKR. As-of-yet, the role of these other viral RNAs and proteins in autophagy inhibition has not been investigated. However, given the evolutionarily conserved requirement for an intact eIF2 kinase signaling pathway in autophagy induction, the prediction is that these other viral inhibitors of PKR, like HSV1 ICP34.5, also function as antagonists of host autophagy.

            "text": "A recent study with the coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, has provided more direct evidence that components of the autophagic machinery can be utilized for RNA virus replication 51 . MHV replication complexes localize to double-membrane vesicles (that are also thought to arise from the ER) ( Figure 5A ) and they co-localize with certain autophagy proteins, including LC3 and Atg12. In MHV-infected atg5 -/-ES cells, double-membrane vesicles are not detected ( Figure 5B) , and viral replication is dramatically reduced. These observations provide the first genetic demonstration that proteins necessary for autophagic vacuole formation are also required for maximal levels of viral replication. Thus, MHV, and potentially other viruses that replicate in association with double-membrane vesicles (e.g. poliovirus, equine arterivirus), utilize components of cellular autophagy to foster their f own growth. Presumably, the Atg protein conjugation system (involving Atg5) that plays a role in autophagic vesicle expansion and completion also plays a role in the formation of double-membrane vesicles involved in viral replication. It is not yet known whether the entire autophagic machinery or only selective components of the autophagic machinery are used for the formation of double-membrane vesicles that are associated with viral replication complexes.",

            "text": "These observations with poliovirus and MHV represent two examples of how viruses can \"subvert\" elements of the host autophagy pathway to promote their own intracellular growth. In these infections, RNA replication complexes are observed in association with \"autophagic-like\" doublemembrane vesicles but not in association with degradative autophagosomes. It is not clear whether this represents fundamental differences in the host pathways leading to the formation of \"autophagic-like\" double-membrane vesicles and classical degradative autophagosomes, the diversion of the autophagic machinery towards the formation of \"autophagic-like\" doublemembrane vesicles from the formation of classical degradative autophagosomes, or specific viral mechanisms to antagonize the maturation of \"autophagic-like\" double-membrane vesicles into mature degradative autophagosomes. However, interestingly, MHV infection does lead to the induction of atg-5-dependent long-lived cellular protein degradation, ruling out the hypothesis that the autophagic machinery is entirely diverted to form membranes required for viral replication complexes. Perhaps MHV possesses as-of-yet defined mechanisms to shield its replication complexes from autophagic degradation.",

            "text": "Although research in this area is still in a stage of infancy, it seems likely that the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy plays an evolutionarily conserved role in antiviral immunity. The interferon-inducible, antiviral PKR signaling pathway positively regulates autophagy, and both mammalian and plant autophagy genes restrict viral replication and protect against virus-induced cell death. Given this role of autophagy in innate immunity, it is not surprising that viruses have evolved numerous strategies to inhibit host autophagy. Different viral gene products can either modulate autophagy regulatory signals or directly interact with components of the autophagy execution machinery. Moreover, certain RNA viruses have managed to \"co-apt\" the autophagy pathway, selectively utilizing certain components of the dynamic membrane rearrangement system to promote their own replication inside the host cytoplasm.",

Accordingly, the inhibition of host autophagy by viral gene products has important implications not only for understanding mechanisms of immune evasion, but also for understanding novel mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. It will be interesting to dissect the role of viral inhibition of autophagy in acute, persistent, and latent viral replication, as well as in the pathogenesis of cancer and other medical diseases.",
