Once 199 capacity, workforce, and safety issues have been addressed, elective procedures can begin. 200 Approach to Operative Case Priority 201 Redistribution of OR availability, a precious commodity, must be handled in an ethical, 202 judicious, and patient-centric manner. Over 16,000 postponed surgical cases, including 1,800 203 orthopedic, need to be performed at our institution. The Surgical Emergency Operations 204 Committee (SEOC) will use clinical guidelines and a multidisciplinary approach to prioritization, 205 fostering transparent, equitable, and ethical decisions 8,23 . Cases will be classified into priority 206 levels using time-sensitive criteria corresponding to their likelihood of harm due to delays in 207 surgery as outlined in Figure 1. It is the surgeons' responsibility to initially identify the Level 4 208 (Emergent) and Level 3 (Urgent) priority cases that have been postponed. They will submit case 209 information via the system database to the Department Chair of each service for approval prior to 210 scheduling (Figure 2). The SEOC will provide oversight of all scheduled cases. Once approved, 211 department administrators will contact the surgeon to provide booking information. After the 212 case is booked, pre-surgical and COVID-19 PCR testing will be the responsibility of the 213 attending surgeon and team. Cases without a resulted COVID-19 PCR test will be cancelled to 214 ensure the safety of all involved (Figure 2).

Additional initiatives have begun to expand traditional ASC 227 block schedules to incorporate limited stay cases adopting \"23-hour\" post-recovery schedules. 228 229 Patient Experience 230 231 While this pandemic has had a significant effect on the hospital system, we must be 232 cognizant of the impact on patients. With high, pandemic related unemployment, some patients 233 may struggle to afford surgery 26,27 .

Regaining patient confidence in the fact that seeking elective healthcare is safe, 240 as well as accurately informing patients of risks, including COVID-19 transmission risks, could 241 begin in the outpatient setting. Providers must understand that patient may have concerns about 242 undergoing surgery at this time, or about their potential exposure to COVID-19 in doing so. 243 Regardless of the risks, patients must be well informed; a trusting physician-patient relationship 244 is instrumental in providing quality care and fostering patient satisfaction.

The first COVID-19 patient was admitted to a Northwell Health hospital on March 4 th , 28 2020. The Northwell Health System is the largest healthcare system in NY State with 23 total 29 hospitals, 5,692 beds, 18 office sites, and 14 ambulatory surgery center (ASC) sites carrying out 30 over 33,000 orthopedic surgical cases yearly. A surge of infected patients followed, culminating 31 in a peak of cases requiring admissions and complex resuscitative treatment. Our purpose is to describe our experience through the onset and advance of the surge, 39 detail our incident response, and discuss the transition toward recovery. As the largest healthcare provider in the state, Northwell Health was on the frontlines 44 during the response to the outbreak. Emergency Departments (ED) first witnessed the 45 devastating consequences as the proportion of daily hospital admissions from the ED exploded 46 from 20% to over 45% at the peak in early April. More than 6,000 patients with suspected 47 COVID-19 were admitted across the health system, with 28% requiring ICU admissions and 48 25% requiring mechanical ventilators. Our Emergency Operations Center saw the early need for personnel and resource reallocation at the 5 tertiary and 11 community hospitals in which 50 orthopedic surgery is performed in our health system. By early April, institutional hospital 51 capacity increased by 23%, effectively creating 1,200 additional beds above the pre-existing 52 capacity of 5,200. To \"load balance\" the patient surge across the system, ICU patients were 53 transferred from overcrowded smaller hospitals to larger tertiary centers. The ramifications of this pandemic and the anticipated radical changes that it may have 253 on our healthcare system and society are still not fully understood. The future remains unclear, 254 but clearly the scope of our practice has been dramatically altered 30,31 . Orthopaedic surgery and 255 healthcare in general will rapidly evolve and changes will be incorporated into our standards of 256 care.

Patients log their daily temperatures leading up to surgical 159 admission and are screened for any symptoms on arrival. All patients should be tested 24-48 160 hours prior to their procedure, with repeat testing if the clinician has high index of suspicion in 161 the presence of a negative test result. Additionally, patients who develop new symptoms 162 consistent with a newly acquired infection or worsening symptoms after previously testing 163 negative or inconclusive for COVID must be tested again. Finally, those patients previously 164 testing positive must successfully complete a two-week quarantine period and then be retested 165 before their surgery.",
