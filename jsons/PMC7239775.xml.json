All the remaining selection criteria must be applied, first of all the exclusion of donors with a previous history of pregnancy and/or blood transfusion.",

However, from now on, we can expect a large number of people who have recovered from an asymptomatic infection (or from a disease with minor clinical signs); many among them are probably regular blood donors, as suggested by the number of post-donation information we are receiving in these days on fever and cough appearance, but also considering the high number of asymptomatic carriers of the virus. As soon as a serology testing is available, the demonstration in their sera of an antibody titer >160 by EIA method (or equivalent with other methods) will represent a unique pool of immune plasma providing donors because they are regular blood donors, they are fully compliant with the selection criteria for plasma donation, and an adequate interval (28 days) can separate the resolution of symptoms from the donation. Therefore, this second group of persons can become a relevant source of immune plasma, not requiring any derogation from legal provisions on donor selection. Their recruitment can easily follow a screening for SARS-CoV-2 (eventually followed by a titration of the antibody) in the population of donors at the time of the donation. This could also contribute to havinga deeper insight into the epidemiology of the disease outside the context of a severe clinical disease leading to hospitalisation of patients.",
