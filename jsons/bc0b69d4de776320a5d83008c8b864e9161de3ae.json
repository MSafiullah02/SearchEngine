[6] [7] [8] [9] A fundamental problem in rapid identification of the etiology of infectious disease outbreaks is the sheer number of microbes, both known and novel, that could potentially be the causative agents. According to a recent review, 10 there are more than 1,400 species of microbes known to be pathogenic to humans. Of these, more than 60% were found to be zoonotic and more than 175 pathogenic species were associated with emerging infectious diseases. These numbers do not include numerous strain variants of each organism or classes of pathogens that infect plants or animals.

New approaches to the parallel detection of multiple infectious agents include multiplexed PCR methods 17, 18 and microarray strategies.

Automated PCR/ESI-MS biosensor. Shown in this view are key modules including amplicon purification (desalting), plate stackers, sample injection, and the mass spectrometer. Precise molecular weight determinations of amplicons yield unambiguous base compositions that are used to uniquely \"fingerprint\" each pathogen. The automated system is capable of analyzing more than 1,500 PCR reactions in 24 h. viruses, fungi, or protozoa present in a sample. The fundamental distinction between this PCR/ESI-MS strategy and traditional (specific) nucleic acid tests is the nature of the question being answered. Traditional nucleic acid tests answer the question: \"Is infectious organism X in my sample?\" The PCR/ESI-MS method answers the question: \"What infectious organisms are in my sample?\" In effect, this is equivalent to running many thousands of specific nucleic acid tests because the identity of the infectious organism being detected does not need to be anticipated. The premise of this technology is that it can provide rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective detection of a broad range of \"normal\" pathogenic organisms and simultaneously identify unexpected or emerging infectious organisms. This broad function technology may be the only practical way to rapidly diagnose diseases caused by emerging infectious organisms that might otherwise be missed or mistaken for a more common infection. 22 The technology has been validated for a variety of applications, including emerging virus identification, 23 determination of the pathogens involved in acute pneumonia epidemics, 24 and identification of biological weapons agents in a variety of sample types. 25, 26 The basis of the above approach is the principle that, despite the enormous diversity of microbes, there are sets of essential common features in their biomolecules. Parallel detection of infectious agents takes advantage of highly conserved regions within genes that flank highly variable regions. These conserved genomic features serve as anchors for broad-range PCR priming to amplify, without prejudice, nucleic acids from most microorganisms in a sample. Such broad-range PCR reactions targeted across the broadest possible grouping of organisms typically result in a mixture of amplicons, reflecting the complexity of the starting sample. With no further separation, this mixture of PCR amplicons is desalted and analyzed by ESI-MS for accurate mass measurement, enabling us to determine the base composition (numbers of A, G, C, and T nucleotides) of the PCR amplicons. 23, 25, 26 Amplification relies on highly conserved regions, but the variability in sequence between the two primer sites, reflected in the base composition, allows us to distinguish between organisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1928, "end": 1930, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2039, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2112, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2191, "end": 2194, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2197, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3075, "end": 3078, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3079, "end": 3082, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3083, "end": 3085, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 282, "text": "(FIG. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "A key aspect of this approach is the concept of \"triangulation.\" In this context, triangulation refers to taking measurements from multiple loci distributed across the microbial genome and using the combination of the measured base composition signatures to identify the organism.

A database of expected base compositions for each primer region for all known organisms was generated using an in silico PCR search algorithm (electronic PCR or ePCR). An existing ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure search algorithm has been modified to include PCR parameters, such as hybridization conditions, mismatches, and thermodynamic calculations. 27 This also provides information on primer specificity of the selected primer pairs.

Several initial reports based on preliminary characterization of the isolated virus suggested it could be a member of one of several viral families, including Coronaviridae. We designed several broad-range primers targeting the various genera within these families. For broad-range detection of all coronaviruses, two PCR primer target regions in orf-1b, one in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the other in Nsp14, were identified prior to publication of the SARS sequence. 23 Locations of primers within these regions were optimized both for sensitivity and broad-range priming potential simultaneously by amplifying dilutions of multiple, diverse coronaviruses. In silico analysis of the final primer pairs against GenBank nucleotide database sequences showed that these primers would be expected to amplify all coronaviruses but no other viruses, bacteria, or human DNA. 27 Multiple isolates of a number of different coronavirus species were obtained from various sources (including the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] and the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego). SARS isolates were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and from Michael Buchmeier (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). PCR products for all isolates were generated, desalted, and analyzed by ESI-MS by methods described previously. 28 The spectral signals were algorithmically processed to obtain base compositions of sense and antisense strands of each amplicon. 29 The results from the analysis of 14 coronavirus isolates are shown in TABLE 1.

9 different species of wild birds), 18 human influenza A isolates (8 H1N1, 10 H3N2), 4 swine isolates (including 1 novel type), 1 equine isolate, and 6 human influenza B isolates. The avian influenza samples represented a variety of host species, influenza virus types, geographic locations, and dates of isolation. Despite the diversity of this sample set, the broad-range primers generated amplicons from all isolates, while the base composition signatures from amplicons obtained with these primers distinguished the isolates(Sampath et al., manuscript submitted). The assay is high throughput (\u223c300 samples/24 h) and rapid (sample to answer in <6 h). In silico analysis of >1,400 influenza virus sequences from the GenBank database showed that the primer panel would detect all known influenza viruses and distinguish >90% of all species, with 100% resolution between avian H5N1 and any human isolate.
