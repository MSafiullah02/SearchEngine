For example, a community-wide outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which resulted in 18 fatalities, had an outbreak source in industrial cooling towers 6 km from the affected community.5 However, bioaerosols may be relatively delicate structures susceptible to damage due to environmental conditions, such as desiccation.6\n",

            "text": "Passive sampling is arguably the most readily available, economic, and unobtrusive method of bioaerosol sampling and relies on particles settling by means of gravity, on a collection substrate housed in a settle plate. The collected particles are usually quantified in terms of the number of colony-forming units (cfu) within the area of the settling plates for the duration of a specified time-period (for example in units of cfu/m2/h). As no mechanical aids, such as a pump, are required, passive sampling has the benefit of not disturbing the surrounding air. The settling velocity of a particle describes the speed of the particle as it descends in still air and is dependent on particle size and density.9 Smaller, lighter particles will remain airborne for longer than larger, denser particles; and if the air speed exceeds the settling velocity the particle will remain suspended indefinitely. In addition, as airflow, even within an enclosed room, will be driven by subtle variations in temperature, the source volume of air for the passively collected sample will be unknown. The combination of these factors has allowed passive sampling to be regarded as both quantitatively and qualitatively inaccurate, and as a subordinate collection method to active sampling. However, this is an oversimplification to the invariably complex nature of bioaerosol sampling. If the area of interest is the dust contamination of surfaces, for example wounds or surgical instruments, then the assessment of the microbial fallout, as opposed to particles remaining suspended in the air, is the imperative.10 Substantial effort has been made to standardize the use of settle plates in the investigation of microbial surface contamination, with consideration given to plate size, position, and length of exposure.11 The 1/1/1 scheme refers to the positioning of 90 mm diameter Petri dishes at a height of 1 m above floor level, 1 m from a wall, and with an exposure time of 1 h. This standardized method also allows for description of the microbial contamination of the surrounding atmosphere through the use of an index of microbial air contamination (IMA). More recently an investigation into contamination in modern operating theatres (OTs) with turbulent airflows suggested that the IMA value could lead to an underestimation of the risk.12\n",

Another study concluded that although settle plates could demonstrate a close correlation with bioaerosol collection undertaken by active samplers, there were exceptions, with settle plates shown to be less sensitive to the collection of fungal spores.14 To countermand this deficiency an increase of the exposure time of settle plates from 1 to 4 h was proposed. By contrast, using a 30 min settle plate exposure time, a study in post-flood central Thailand demonstrated that settle plates can be used as an alternative to active sampling systems.15 The study did, however, acknowledge that the higher than average fungal bioaerosol presence may have limited the generalizability of their findings.",

Surface contamination is especially influenced by human activity such as touch. Surface and air sampling both concluded that the bed areas were consistently highly contaminated. The effectiveness of nitrocellulose membranes as an alternative to replication detection and organism counting (RODAC) plates for surface sampling has been demonstrated.17 The membranes have the advantage of being more effective at removing microbes, while also enabling samples to be taken from curved surfaces.",

The mass of a particle is equal to its volume multiplied by its density, so it is possible for two particles to have the same mass but differing volumes and densities. If, however, two particles have the same density but differ in volume, then the larger particle will have a greater mass than the smaller particle. The inertia of a particle can be described as follows: consider two particles with differing masses being carried by an air flow inside a pipe. On reaching a bend in the pipe, the particle with the smaller mass will be able to travel along the airflow streamline and continue beyond the bend, whereas the particle with the larger mass will be unable to turn as quickly and will hit the wall and potentially become attached (Figure 2\n). When a particle collides with a wall because its mass is too great to allow it to travel with the airflow, the collision is known as inertial impaction. If particles of varying size all have the same density then the larger particles will succumb more readily than the smaller particles to inertial impaction, hitting the wall at a bend in the pipe. Hence the smaller particles will be collected in the sampling devices but the larger ones will not.",

The air sample is passed through an array of nozzles that channel a jet of particle-laden air across a gap towards an agar culture plate, which lies perpendicular to the nozzle outlet. The air flow of the jet will follow a set of curves known as streamlines through the sampler; these curves lie tangentially to the velocity vectors of the flow. The plate deflects the streamlines by 90\u00b0, with the air flowing past the plate and through the passageway between the plate and the device walls (Figure 5\n). The particles with sufficiently low inertia will be carried by the streamlines and escape capture. However, particles with higher inertia will be unable to follow the 90\u00b0 curve of the streamlines, and, under the influence of the centrifugal force, will impact on the agar plate. The collection efficiency of an impactor is therefore primarily dependent on the diameter and density of the particle and the diameter of the nozzle, along with the air velocity of the jet (hence the need to calibrate the air flow through the device). The efficiency of an impactor should have a sharp cut-off curve, with the ideal impactor acting like a sieve, with all particles above a certain size, known as the cut-off size, being captured by the agar plate. This feature makes impactors highly suitable as particle size classifiers, with particles greater than a given size being separated from the air flow, while smaller particles remain airborne. A single-stage impactor has one cut-off size, so only requires one set of nozzles and an agar plate (see example in Figure 1c).",

Each tier, known as a stage, will collect particles of a specific size with the smaller particles remaining airborne and passing on to the next stage. At each subsequent stage, the nozzle diameter will become progressively smaller, hence the jet velocity increases, and the particle cut-off size is reduced. Finally the air flow will pass through a filter to allow remaining small particles to be captured. By weighing the impaction plates from each stage and the filter, before and after sampling, the fraction of the total mass in each particle size range can be established. After cultivation the number of cfu should be enumerated and the counts corrected by positive-hole correction method, which accounts for deposition of multiple bioaerosol particles at the same deposition area.44, 45, 46, 47\n",

The airflow over the impaction plates may also be disturbed by the build-up of deposited particles, leading to altered collection efficiencies; however, this can be overcome by the use of multi-jet impactors with >100 nozzles. The bioefficiency of impactors is reduced due to the shear forces on the bioaerosol particles within the jet and on impaction with the agar plates. The microbial species under investigation along with jet velocity and jet-to-plate distance have been found to play an important role in the enumeration of bioaerosols.48 Desiccation of the pathogen will also reduce bioefficiency, which can be overcome by mineral-oil-spread agar plates.49 Despite the drawback of reduced viability, impactors are frequently used in sampling for many airborne pathogens.18, 50, 51\n",

However, virtual impactors do not collect on to an agar plate but instead have a collection probe operating with a minor flow. This works by particles entering the impactor and being carried by the major flow around a bend (Figure 6\n). The smaller particles are able to follow the streamlines around the curve while the particles larger than the cut-off diameter of the apparatus have sufficient inertia to carry them into the collection probe. The minor flow in the collection probe carries these larger particles on to a collection filter. Likewise the smaller particles are collected on a filter in a separate part of the device. Virtual impactors usually have only one or two stages, as each separation stage requires control of both the major and minor flow rates. The use of a collection probe rather than an agar plate avoids issues of particle bounce and deposition build-up; however, virtual impactors suffer collection losses near to the size of the cut-off diameter at the inlet of the probe. A useful feature of these devices is that the airflow in effect concentrates the particles larger than the cut-off size into a smaller volume of air, making virtual impactors useful as particle concentrators.52\n",

Teflon filters were fitted to the GSP samplers to allow endotoxin capture, whereas polycarbonate filters were successfully used for bacteria, mould, and virus collection. This study was the first to detect viruses, specifically norovirus GI, using GSP samplers.47\n",

The PTFE filters successfully captured WU polyomavirus and human papillomavirus 120 along with other pathogens. One drawback of this study, which was focused on analysing the inhaled breath of the workers, was that it became apparent that the filters were also sampling exhaled breath. This would have been overcome by the use of larger static samplers placed away from workers' immediate environment that were able to sample a bulk background air volume. On occasion, using more than one type of sampler may be necessary to overcome specific sampler limitations.53\n",

This can be undertaken by spiking the sampler with a known concentration of the pathogen and then assessing the concentration collected.60 However, earlier studies used various other methods, such as using two samplers in tandem or parallel, to assess sampling efficiency.117 Surrogate viruses may be used to limit the hazard when investigating high-risk pathogens, but it should be borne in mind that each pathogen responds uniquely to the conditions experienced.118 The time-interval during which the sampler will operate should also be replicated during laboratory testing in order to identify any operational issues or time-related loss of bioefficiency. During such bioefficiency tests, inherent variations in performance of the sampler may also become evident over different particle size ranges.119\n",

When using samplers with differing flow rates concurrently, it may be preferable to calculate the sampling time of each device so that the volume of air captured is the same.

Combining this information with the genus of the captured microbe, the particle size range (informing on the penetration of the respiratory system), and the health effects on the human or animal population, conclusions can be made regarding bioaerosol concentration and health risk. Presently there is no international consensus on the acceptable exposure limits of bioaerosol concentration, with a recent review drawing attention to this research deficit.53 A lack of bioaerosol studies targeting viruses and archea has also been identified, further limiting our understanding of the impact of airborne microbes on human health.123 Several of the studies discussed in this review were based in bioaerosol-emitting facilities, such as WWTP and compost facilities, where the exposure to harmful microbes is a cause for concern for occupational safety reasons and for risk to health of the population in the surrounding area. In such cases the task for current research is to establish suitable dose\u2013response relationships to enable health-based exposure limits for bioaerosols to be derived.124 Such exposure limits would be designed to protect the general population from the ill effects of long-term exposure to bioaerosols. The situation for healthcare studies is quite different with a wide array of \u2018at risk\u2019 groups needing to be considered, making the derivation of health-based exposure limits challenging. The staff, patients or their visitors may be the source of the bioaerosol health risk, such as with SARS virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, measles, mumps, or rubella viruses.53 Their stay in hospital may be brief and may not be contained to one ward, making it difficult to trace the source of an outbreak. The wider environment may also be a source of harmful bioaerosols, such as an increased risk of airborne aspergillus during construction activities or the risk of legionella bacteria in HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) or water systems.",

With the inclusion of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters within OTs, cleanroom technology standards have frequently been applied to these healthcare settings with the airborne particulate count being monitored. With the observations that bioaerosol sampling is time consuming, requires trained personnel and that results are not instantaneous, interest has grown in the correlation between microbiological and dust contamination, to the extent that it has been suggested that microbial sampling should be limited to epidemics, validation of protocols, or changes to the OT environment that may affect microbial content.125\n",

In addition to measuring the dust count using a light-scattering particle analyser, bioaerosol sampling was undertaken using both passive and active sampling. Settle plates with a 90 mm diameter were placed at strategic locations, 1 m above floor level, throughout the OT and left exposed during 23 surgical operations. The active sampling was undertaken using a single stage slip-type impactor operating at 25 L/min for duration of 20 min, with samples taken during 13 operations. The study did observe an increased concentration of dust particles >5 \u03bcm during conventional surgery as opposed to scope procedures. An inverse relationship between dust and bacterial concentration was reported. As the OT door opened into the anaesthetic room, the turbulent airflow resulting from the pressure differential between the two rooms in effect removed dust from the OT. However, the bacterial concentration increased and it was proposed that this may be due to increased movement of the staff. This highlights the need for the investigator to be aware of airflow in and between areas under investigation, in addition to patterns of human activity.",

Passive sampling was undertaken using 90 mm diameter settle plates using the 1/1/1 scheme (explained in the section on \u2018Passive sampling\u2019) with tryptic soy agar used for the total aerobic bacterial count, whereas Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol was used for fungal isolation. Active sampling of airborne contamination was carried out using a DUOSAS 360 sampler (Pbi International, Milan, Italy) operating at 180 L/min. The study found a moderately strong correlation between the active and passive sampling methods, with the discrepancy between the two techniques being attributed to the relatively short sampling period and limited spatial collection zone of the active sampler compared with the longer exposure time of the settle plates. The investigation also concluded that bioaerosol sampling could be used for the evaluation of the ventilation and air conditioning system within the OT. Comparing the results from sampling during different surgical procedures also had the potential to inform improved surgical hygiene practice.",

The sampling period was 3 min, with duplicate samples taken at a height of 1.2\u20131.5 m from floor level to represent the breathing zone of healthcare workers. In concurrence with a previous study, Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. bacteria were frequently found in the operating theatre area.116 The study found a positive correlation between airborne bacterial concentration and suspended particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). A positive correlation was also found between the number of people in a room and CO2 concentrations, but, when temperature, relative humidity and sampling location were accounted for, no significant correlation was found between the number of people and bacterial concentrations. One exception was the postoperative recovery room where there were a greater number of people, higher CO2 levels, and higher concentrations of bacteria. Caution should be exercised when investigating the relationship between the number of human occupants and the concentration of airborne microbes. Although a correlation has been noted within one room of this investigation and in previous studies mentioned in this section, a study carried out in an environmental chamber suggested that outdoor air had a greater influence on the bioaerosol composition.129\n",

The air within the outpatient area was sampled for 8 h a day whereas the air in the emergency room was monitored during 24 h periods. In both cases, the bioaerosol sampler was positioned in the breathing zone between 1.2 and 1.5 m above floor height. During the course of the study, 186 filter samples were taken and airborne adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected in both monitored areas, with greatest prevalence found in the outpatient area. The negative control was the use of filters with no air flow passing though the sampling device. No adenovirus and M. pneumoniae was found on the negative controls. The study did, however, notice evidence of seasonal variation in this Taiwanese hospital, with airborne adenovirus peaking in the summer months, whereas M. pneumoniae detection rates increased in the autumn and winter. Identifying peaks in bioaerosol contamination during certain months allows for ventilation rates in affected areas to be increased to reduce the risk to patient health. Effective ventilation and controlled airflow patterns within wards alongside improvements in hygiene and operational procedures are arguably the strongest defence against high concentrations of airborne microbial contamination.4, 112, 130, 131\n",

Sampling devices vary with regards to their collection efficiency. Concentrations of airborne pathogens are influenced by airflows within the hospital building and seasonal variation. The influence and correlation between human activity, air quality (humidity, temperature, CO2 concentration) and dust particle count on bioaerosol concentration is uncertain, with contradictory results being presented. The transmission dynamics of some pathogens are not fully understood and an airborne component to transmission should not be overlooked. Even with a good understanding of the concentrations of bioaerosols in an environment, the health-based exposure limits for a diverse group of patients and staff may not be known. Yet such research can inform on appropriate ventilation rates to maintain good air quality, assess the bioaerosol risk to patients and staff, gain a greater understanding of the transmission dynamics of pathogens, and suggest improvements to hygiene procedures.
