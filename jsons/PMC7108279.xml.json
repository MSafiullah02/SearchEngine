This seminal observation, along with similar findings described by Nagano and Kojima in 1958 [2], set the stage for subsequent studies that led to the elucidation of the IFN system in exquisite detail [3].",

Three distinct types of IFNs are now recognized (types I, II, and III) based on their structural features, receptor usage and biological activities [8]. A synopsis of the major features of IFN family member components is reported in Table 1\n. Type I IFN family in humans consists of 14 IFN\u03b1 species [9] and a single species of IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03ba, IFN\u03c9, and IFN\u025b, while there is only one type II IFN known as IFN\u03b3. All the type I IFN components lack introns and are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 9 in human and chromosome 4 in mouse genome. The single IFN\u03b3 gene possesses three introns and maps to the long arm of chromosome 12 in human, and chromosome 10 in mouse genome. Although some IFNs are modified post-translationally by N- and O-glycosylation, the major human IFN\u03b1 subspecies are not glycosylated [3]. IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 gene products appear to function as monomers, whereas IFN\u03b3 appear to function as homodimers [10]. On the other hand, IFN\u03bb genes are clustered together on human 19 or murine 7 chromosome. The IFN\u03bb3 gene (IL28B) is transcribed in the opposite direction of the IFN-\u03bb1 (IL29) and IFN\u03bb2 (IL28A) genes [8].",

            "text": "Although all IFNs are important mediators of antiviral protection, their roles in antiviral defense vary. Type I IFNs have four major functions. First, they induce cell-intrinsic antimicrobial states in infected and neighboring cells that limit the spread of infectious agents, particularly viral pathogens. Second, they modulate innate immune responses in a balanced manner that promotes antigen presentation and natural killer cell functions while restraining pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokine production. Third, they activate the adaptive immune system, thus promoting the development of high-affinity antigen-specific T and B cell responses and immunological memory [9]. Fourth, they present an antiproliferative activity: in fact, several recent studies showed type I IFN-induced autophagy in multiple cancer cell lines highlighting a new function of type I IFN as an inducer of autophagy. This new function of type I IFN may play an important role in viral clearance, antigen presentation, inhibition of proliferation, as well as a positive feedback loop for the production of type I IFN [11]. Type I IFNs are protective in acute viral infections but can have either protective or deleterious roles in bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases. Most cell types produce IFN\u03b2, whereas haematopoietic cells, particularly plasmacytoid dendritic cells, are the predominant producers of IFN\u03b1. Type I IFN production is induced after the sensing of microbial products by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)4\u20136 and by cytokines [9]. IFN\u03b3 is mainly secreted by T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. IFN\u03b3 secretion by natural killer (NK) cells and professional antigen presenting cells is likely to be important in early host defense against infection, whereas T lymphocytes become the major source of IFN\u03b3 in the adaptive immune response. IFN\u03b3 production is controlled by cytokines secreted by antigen presenting cells, most notably IL12 and IL18. Macrophage recognition of many pathogens induces the secretion of IL-12 and several chemokines. These chemokines attract natural killer cells to the site of inflammation, and IL-12 promotes IFN\u03b3 synthesis in these cells [12]. IFN\u03b3 also plays a central role in the development of antitumor immune responses, and it can amplify the induction of antiviral activity by IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2. Therefore, type I and type II IFN often work together to activate a variety of innate and adaptive immune responses that result in the induction of effective antitumor immunity and the elimination of viral infections [10], [13]. On the other hand, the IFN\u03bb signal transduction cascade is very similar to that induced by type I IFNs (IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2). Therefore, it is not surprising that type I and type III IFNs exert similar biological activities. Both types of IFN possess the intrinsic ability to induce antiviral activity in cells [8]. In fact, the IFN\u03bbs are usually coexpressed together with type I IFNs by virus infected cells [6], [7].",

            "text": "IFNs are part of the larger family of class II cytokines that also includes 6 IL-10-related cytokines: IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26 [14], [15], [16] as well as several viral IL-10-related cytokines [17]. Class II cytokines all signal via receptors that share common motifs in their extracellular domains, and are indicated as class II cytokine receptor family (CRF2). Consequently, IFNs and the IL-10-related cytokines are sometimes referred to as \u201cCRF2 cytokines\u201d [8]. However, although the tertiary structure of IFN\u03b3 resembles that of IL-10, its primary structure significantly diverges from all of the CRF2 ligands. The most recent addition to the CRF2 family members, type III IFN or IFN\u03bb, demonstrates structural features of the IL-10-related cytokines but also induces antiviral activity in a variety of target cells, which supports their functional classification as a new IFN type [6], [7]. Phylogenetically, the IFN\u03bb genes reside somewhere between the type I IFN and IL-10 gene families. Amino acid sequence comparison shows that the type III IFN members exhibit about 5\u201318% identity with either type I IFN members or the IL-10-related cytokines. The IFN\u03bb proteins bind and signal through a receptor complex composed of the unique IFN\u03bbR1 chain (also known as IL-28RA) and the shared IL-10R2 chain which is also a part of the receptor complexes for IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26. In contrast, all type I IFN members exert their biological activities through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the IFN\u03b1R1 (IFNAR1) and IFN\u03b1R2 (IFNAR2) chains, and type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) engages the IFN\u03b3R1 (IFNGR1) and IFN\u03b3R2 (IFNGR2) chains to assemble its functional receptor complex [8].",

Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they assemble with IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a trimolecular complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 binds to its cognate DNA sequences, which are known as IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), thereby directly activating the transcription of ISGs, many of which establish a cellular antiviral state. ISG-encoded proteins restrain pathogens by several mechanisms, including the inhibition of viral transcription, translation and replication, the degradation of viral nucleic acids and the alteration of cellular lipid metabolism. Cellular responses to IFNAR ligation are cell type- and context-dependent and vary during the course of an immune response [9]. Therefore, as said above, although the IFN\u03bb members do not use the IFN\u03b1 receptor complex for signaling, signaling through either IFN\u03bb or IFN\u03b1 receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade [8].",

            "text": "The relevance of genetic and epigenetic variations in determining the range of susceptibility and of clinical severity of several diseases, including those caused by infectious agents, in the human population is well known. Therefore, considering the importance of IFN system in antiviral defense mechanisms and, more broadly, in immune response, it is not surprising that genetic and epigenetic variations within the IFN genes and in those associated with sensing/signaling/response are associated with a range of diseases. In recent years, inborn errors affecting the production of IFN family members have been reported in human patients. Insights into the specific role of human IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb-induction pathways in anti-viral immunity have been provided by the study of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in Western countries caused by the almost ubiquitous and almost innocuous herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). HSE has been shown to result from a new group of primary immunodeficiencies; the first two genetic etiologies of this disease have been identified as UNC-93B and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) deficiencies. These discoveries demonstrated the critical role of the UNC-93B-dependent, TLR3-IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and IFN\u03bb pathway in immunity to HSV-1 in children. The wide redundancy of other TLR-mediated IFN induction pathways is probably responsible for the lack of increased susceptibility to common viral infection and HSE that is reported for IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4)-deficient patients, who display impaired production of IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and IFN\u03bb following the activation of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 [18]. Increased susceptibility to multiple viruses, including HSV-1, has been reported also for inborn errors affecting the response to IFN family members, such as STAT1 or TYK2 deficiency [19]. In addition, IFN\u03b3 deficiencies confer Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) that is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the occurrence of severe, often disseminated, clinical disease, caused by weakly virulent mycobacterial species, such as bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccines and non-tuberculous environmental mycobacteria (EM), in otherwise healthy individuals [18]. IFN\u03b3 production is controlled by cytokines secreted by myeloid cells, including IL-12 and IL23. Disorders of six genes of the IL-12/23\u2013IFN\u03b3 circuit were discovered since 1996, demonstrating the critical role of this circuit in protective immunity to mycobacteria [20], [21]. The role of IL-12-dependent IFN\u03b3 production has been confirmed by recent studies, showing that defects in IL-12p40 or IL-12R\u03b21 and specific mutations in NEMO [nuclear factor (NF)-kB essential modulator] are specifically associated with impaired IFN\u03b3-mediated immunity and clinical MSMD [18]. Furthermore, over 347 IFN\u03b3 gene variants and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in either IFN\u03b3 promoter region or in NF\u03baB binding regions, have been described in multiple ethnic populations, often affecting IFN\u03b3 gene expression. Many of these variants appear to modulate susceptibility not only to infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, but also to some non-infectious conditions such as aplastic anemia and psoriasis; susceptibility to cervical cancer, that is in a position to bridge viral and non viral mechanisms, is also influenced by host genetic factors targeting IFN\u03b3 reviewed in [22]. Besides genetic variants, several epigenetic modifications are also described, increasing IFN\u03b3 expression in Th1 lymphocytes and reducing IFN\u03b3 expression in Th2 lymphocytes Increased methylation of IFN\u03b3 promoter and consequent decreased expression of this gene is associated with asthma; on the contrary, decreased methylation is associated with increased diastolic blood pressure, biliary atresia, dental pulp inflammation and chronic periodontitis [22]. Overall, human inborn errors affecting IFN system have provided conclusive evidence that the members of IFN family are crucial for protective immunity and innate defense against viral, bacterial and non-infectious diseases. However non-redundant role of these members seems to arise, with a certain polarization of protection, as IFN\u03b3 seems to be essential for anti-mycobacterial immunity, whereas IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb are essential for anti-viral immunity [18].",

            "text": "The cell can detect an ongoing viral invasion, through sensors located in the cytoplasm or on the membrane of endosomes. These molecules include the cytosolic retinoic-acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) dsRNA helicases, through downstream interaction with the interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1 (IPS-1) adaptor protein, and some Toll-like receptors (TLR), as TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 [23], [24], [27]. The vast majority of human infections is due to RNA viruses; those with a dsRNA genome (as rotaviruses and other reoviruses) are detected by TLR3 or by MDA5. During replication of positive-sense ssRNA viruses (picornaviruses like hepatitis A virus and poliovirus, flaviviruses like hepatitis C virus and West Nile virus, coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus), a dsRNA intermediate form is produced in the cytoplasm, which is recognized by MDA5. The latter two families may also be sensed by RIG-I. The viruses with a negative-sense ssRNA genome (orthomyxoviruses as influenza A virus, paramyxoviruses like measle virus, mumps virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and Newcastle disease virus, rhabdoviruses like rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, filoviruses like Ebola virus, hantaviruses, Borna disease virus, etc.) activate RIG-I with their ssRNA genome. Double-stranded DNA viruses (such as \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses) are sensed by TLR9; by convergent transcription they can also produce dsRNA and thus activate TLR3, IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and also MDA5 and/or RIG-I. Retroviruses (such as HIV-1 and human T-lymphotropic virus I and II) have a diploid positive-sense ssRNA genome in the virion, that is reverse transcribed into dsDNA provirus, which is then integrated into the host genome. Retroviral ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8. The reverse transcription intermediates are recognized by the cytosolic IFI16 and cGAS DNA sensors, and this leads to the initiation of the type I IFN antiviral response, pyroptosis and apoptosis, under the regulation by host restriction factors such as SAMHD1 and TREX1.",

These activated molecules translocate to the nucleus and interact with the IFN promoter sequences, to upregulate the expression of interferon genes. IRF-3 activity is hampered by human papillomavirus (HPV) through the E6 protein, by the Influenza A virus through the NS1 protein, that is thought to bind and sequester viral dsRNA, to protect it from cell intrinsic viral RNA detection, and in Filoviruses there is an inverse correlation between the magnitude of IFN\u03b1/IFN\u03b2 responses and virulence in humans [23], [25], [28], [29].",

Complex viruses have multiple mechanisms to interfere with the IFN system; the various poxviruses are active against type I and type III interferons through a secreted protein, antagonize NF-\u03baB and have a specific interferon-gamma-binding protein that interfere with the binding to the cell receptor [37], [38], [39], [40]. Almost every step of the IFN response can be interfered by the vaccinia poxvirus: induction of IFNs, activation of the NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 and of the JAK-STAT pathways, as well as the activity of the effectors of the antiviral state, such as those involving PKR- and the 2\u2032-5\u2032-Oligoadenylate synthetase [37], [41].

Each type of IFN can induce the expression of hundreds of genes to mediate various biological responses. Although IFNs are effective inhibitors of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), almost all RNA and DNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the host IFN response, and are able to resist, at least in part, to the IFN-mediate inhibition. However, several studies have shown that viruses normally resistant to the effects of type I or type II IFN separately, are susceptible to IFNs when used in combination. The reciprocal potentiation of type I or type II IFN is a well known phenomenon described since 1979 [43], and has been observed for both antiviral and antitumor effects [44]. Synergistic antiviral activity resulting from the contemporary presence of both IFN types has also been described in HIV-infected patients and in some autoimmune diseases [45]. It has been demonstrated that IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 synergistically inhibit the replication of HSV-1 both in vitro and in vivo [46], [47]. In addition, several reports have indicated that IFN family members used in combination have a synergistic antiviral activity against other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) [48], Lassa virus (LASV) [49], Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) [50], human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) [47] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [51], [52].",

The genes cooperatively induced by IFN\u03b21 and IFN\u03b3 included those involved in apoptosis, RNA degradation and inflammatory response. As result, the combination of IFN\u03b21 and IFN\u03b3 induced more apoptosis and inhibited HSV-1 gene expression and DNA replication significantly more than treatment with either IFN alone [53].",

In addition, antagonism for the intracellular pathways involved in antiviral activity has been reported [57]. In a recent study [58] possible synergism/antagonism between IFN\u03b1 and/or IFN\u03bb in the inhibition of virus replication (EMCV, WNV lineage 1 and 2, CHIKV and HSV-1) has been investigated in different cell lines. The results showed that IFN\u03bb is less effective than IFN\u03b1 for both the inhibition of virus replication, and that IFN\u03bb antagonized the IFN\u03b1-driven inhibition of virus replication. The findings on antiviral activity are paralleled by analogous trends in the induction of the molecular mediators of antiviral activity (MxA and 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS).

Type II IFN is more effective than type I IFN (being IFN\u03b2 more potent than IFN\u03b1), while type III IFN is restrained by the low or limited presence of the specific receptor on the membrane of the target cells [66], [67], [68]. IFN\u03b2 has a greater receptor-binding affinity than IFN\u03b1, and this finding may account for the more potent and different antiproliferative and perhaps immunoregulatory actions of IFN\u03b2 [69]. The anti-growth activity of IFNs is mediated by arrest of the cell cycle and induction of caspases and apoptosis; it occurs in all the somatic cells tested, with differences depending on the IFN type and dosage [66], [70]. The anti-proliferative activity of type III IFNs does not occur in all the receptor-positive cells but depends on the cell type, at variance with the antiviral activity and up-regulation of MHC class I molecules [66]. Because of possible therapy of melanoma, type I IFNs were extensively studied in keratinocytes and melanocytes [67]; of note, the IFN\u03b2 expression in vitro by undifferentiated, growth-arrested murine keratinocytes suggested that its production by terminally differentiated cells was associated with arrest of proliferation. Recently it was reported the induction of autophagy by type I and type II IFNs in cancer cells, a mechanism that may counteract the pro-apoptotic functions of IFNs [11], [71], [72], through the p38 MAPK pathway and ATF6 phosphorylation [72].",

            "text": "IFNs are potent immunomodulators, especially IFN\u03b3; among the IFN\u03b1 subtypes, each has its own immunomodulatory pattern [77]. In general, IFNs stimulate already differentiated cells in the short term, while, by growth inhibition, in the long term or with higher IFN concentrations, they may reduce the replacement of exhausted cells with their precursors. Immunomodulatory effects include enhancement of surface molecules such as MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigens, several receptors, and modulation of the activation and differentiation of effector cells, as monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), B, T and NK cells. Type I and III IFNs and, with higher efficiency, type II IFN upregulate the expression of class I MHC and co-stimulatory molecules by tissue cells and immune cells, as the DCs, that differentiate into efficient antigen- and self-antigen-presenting cells, leading to activation of quiescent reactive T helper cells [66], [78], [79], [80]. The expression of class II MHC molecules is upregulated by all three IFN types, being the type II the most active [81], [82]. The effect of the latter IFN can be interfered by type I IFNs [83]. The activation of DR and of chemokine receptors may modify the phenotype (and recognition of progeny virions), and virus binding on the membrane [84], [85]. Type I IFNs thus function to elevate both innate and adaptive immune responses, with induction of cytokines and chemokines, activation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells and CTLs, the activation and differentiation of B cells, the production of antibodies and the switching of immunoglobulin (Ig)isotypes [61], [66], [77]. Type III IFNs were not demonstrated to increase antibody formation, and were shown to modulate Th1/Th2 cells balance through a different mechanism from type I IFNs [66]. IFN\u03b3, but not IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 can induce neutrophils to suppress lymphocyte proliferation through the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [86]. Type II IFN is essential also in immunity intracellular non-viral parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, etc., and elicits strong cell-autonomous killing of intracellular parasites; also type I IFN, however is induced during these infections: it does not exert an intrinsic control of parasites, but its signaling recruits NK cells, which then mediate parasite killing by producing type II IFN [87].",

            "text": "Dysregulation in production/signaling of all IFN types are associated to a variety of pathologies. Activation of IFN\u03b1 pathways were related to several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison's disease, etc. [88]. Miscarriage of humans and animals has been associated with higher levels of IFN\u03b3, that, on the other hand, is involved in maintaining the decidual layer and vascular remodeling in the uterus [89]. Abnormality in IFN-stimulated gene patterns, causing failures in immunotolerance in early childhood were proposed to be contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes and cases of type 1 diabetes were also related to treatments with pegylated IFN and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C [90]. Cardiovascular complications can be observed in IFN-treated subjects (arrhythmia, myocarditis, reversible hypertension, ischemic heart disease, pericarditis and pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy) and are generally reversible [88]. Sarcoidosis, a systemic chronic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, is a rare adverse effect from the use of type I IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, that reflects an exaggerated cell-mediated immune response to an unknown persistent antigen, with higher levels of circulating IFN\u03b3 [91]. Thyroid dysfunctions in IFN-treated patients were observed since 1985 [92], and are still a significant problem for patients receiving either IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2; in vitro and animal studies showed that thyroid inflammation and autoimmunity involve direct effects (increased expression of thyroid differentiation) as well as activation of destructive bystander immune responses [93]. Significant exacerbations were caused by treatment of multiple sclerosis patients with IFN\u03b3, while IFN\u03b2 is currently given as therapy, and seems to be more potent than IFN\u03b1 [94], [95]. In the EAE animal model of multiple sclerosis, a regulatory role of Type III IFN-producing CD4+ T cells conferring protection against EAE was proposed [96]. Depression and other cognitive and psychiatric disturbances are reported by approximately half of the patients treated with IFN\u03b1 for chronic hepatitis C and B, Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, melanoma and lymphoma [97]. IFN\u03b1 determines abnormalities of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and disturbances of brain metabolism, and interferes with neurotrophic signaling, thus hindering neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, endogenous neurogenesis and neuronal survival [97]. Comparing patients receiving pegylated IFN\u03b1 plus ribavirin with those receiving IFN\u03b2 plus ribavirin, it was found that depressive symptoms were more prevalent following IFN\u03b1 than IFN\u03b2 treatment [98]. In mice, IFN\u03b1 was reported either to promote antidepressant-like effect associated with an increase in brain serotonin turn over, or to promote a depression-like phenotype, mediated by suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and induction of depression [99], while the lack of IFN\u03b3 increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors of IFN\u03b3-knocked out animals, suggesting that IFN\u03b3 is involved in hippocampal neurogenesis and CNS plasticity [100].",

Because of the multitude of IFN-induced genes, also opposite effects can be determined by the same IFN, depending on timing and dosages, and IFNs may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on the disease context. Genetic diversity, with polymorphisms and mutations, can modulate the extent of IFN responses and the susceptibility to infections, and genetic and epigenetic variations within the IFN genes and in those associated with sensing/signaling/response can be linked to diseases.
