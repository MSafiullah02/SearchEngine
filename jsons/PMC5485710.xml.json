In Bangladesh, several NiV outbreaks have been identified since 2001, and raw date palm sap consumption has been repeatedly implicated as the pathway of transmission from bats to humans [5, 6]. Raw sap is collected during cold months, from November to March, by shaving the bark near the top of the date palm tree [6, 7]. During sap collection, bats often visit date palm trees and contaminate sap with their saliva and urine [7, 8]. Interrupting bat-to-human transmission may reduce the risk of a potentially large outbreak.",

After the intervention, local residents\u2019 knowledge of NiV increased, and people reported changing their behavior to reduce the risk of NiV transmission through date palm sap [11]. Thus, understanding the intervention development, process and logistics will help plan scaling it up. Calculating the approximate cost of the intervention, and the proportion of people to be reached, is useful to make investment decisions [12\u201314] between potential interventions to prevent not just NiV, but other emerging zoonoses.",

NiV usually affects impoverished rural communities in Bangladesh, thus, affected families often experience a severe social and financial crisis [24, 25]. NiV kills people and leaves survivors with permanent neurological sequelae, similar to those experienced by some survivors of Japanese encephalitis [26, 27]. Sixty-one percent of NiV cases affected males with a mean age of 27 [3] who could be the main wage earners of the family. Most died [3], and those that survived could not continue to work due to the neurological effects of NiV. In addition, NiV is a disease that requires special care. Hospitalization and illness episodes can last a week [28]. The financial burden associated with hospitalization translates into reduced monthly food and children education expenditures, having to borrow money, taking loans with high interests, and selling assets [29\u201331]. Prevention could reduce the risk of disease transmission as well as save poor families from social degradation.",

However, in addition to causing sickness and death, outbreaks have social consequences including fear, social unrest, violence and economic loss [33\u201336]. For diseases with moderate to high perceived severity, such as pandemic influenza, SARS or Ebola, investing and intervening earlier in the outbreak can be cost effective [37]. NiV is a deadly disease that can transmit from person to person and represents a global pandemic threat [38, 39]. Estimating NiV prevention costs is of interest to local and global health communities, helping to make informed decisions on funding interventions to prevent this disease. If we prevent a large high-mortality NiV pandemic, an effective intervention would be remarkably cost-efficient.",

Investing in active surveillance activities for zoonotic infections, implementing effective ecological health interventions, improving modeling capabilities, increasing evaluations of health systems and public health needs and policies, and implementing better risk communication can improve the preparedness to respond to emerging infectious diseases [42]. For example, Taiwan established a nationwide emergency department, based on a syndromic surveillance system, that collaborated with 189 hospitals for better public heath response to improve their pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities [43].

The high cost of the meetings used in this intervention makes it impossible to scale up and sustain this intervention without external funding. Reducing meetings and interpersonal communication would reduce costs and so increase the feasibility of scaling it up. We could achieve a lower cost intervention by including community health workers [50] and health workers from the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), as well as health workers from NGOs such as BRAC [51, 52]. They could conduct meetings in the areas immediately surrounding their offices, affix posters, provide leaflets, and disseminate messages to people receiving their services during the sap harvesting season, adding a minimal cost. In addition, eliminating the gachhi incentive for using banas would reduce the cost of the gachhi intervention by more than one-third.",
