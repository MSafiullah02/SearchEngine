This system, which we call Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decision (SSMD), involves deciding sequentially, by geographical areas, sectors of activity, age groups and immunity, which workers can return to work at a given time according to the epidemiological criteria of the country as well as that of a group of reference countries, used as a benchmark, that have suffered a lower level of lockdown de-escalation strategies. We apply SSMD to Spain, based on affiliation to the Social Security system prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conclude that 98.37% of the population could be affected. The proposed system makes it possible to accurately identify the target population for serological IgG antibody tests in the work field, as well as those affected by special income replacement measures due to lockdown being maintained over a longer period.",

On January 23, Chinese authorities reacted to mass contagion in the city of Wuhan by imposing major restrictions on the mobility of people, in other words a lockdown, which was later extended by varying degrees to other parts of the area affected 4 . This measure was subsequently applied in Italy, initially only to certain northern regions and later to the country as a whole. Finally, Spain directly applied a national lockdown, without exceptions (Royal Decree 463/2020, March 14). Since then, many of the countries affected have been applying lockdown measures, although with very different characteristics and to varying degrees and normally adopting less stringent lockdown measures than those imposed in Spain.",

It is also reasonable, therefore, to propose that lockdown exit strategies should follow the same pattern. In the case of COVID-19, it will not be possible for the lockdown exit strategy to be a symmetrical but reverse process to the lockdown strategy since, while there is no vaccine, many services will be forced to change their production organization and it will not be possible to meet demand in the same way as before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Authorities can either follow the previous course and completely reopen all economic-social activity, maintaining lockdown in its original state until final deconfinement, or apply a selective lockdown exit strategy in stages. The first option has the social and economic benefit of allowing all workers to return to their jobs, which avoids a deeper recession. However, it has the disadvantage of possible loss of health and human life if there is a fresh outbreak. The second, the other extreme, has the disadvantage of the loss of the social and economic benefit associated with economic paralysis, triggering a longer-lasting recession, although it would prevent the virus from re-emerging and thus prevent fatalities. In between the two lie all the selective or partial lockdown de-escalation strategies based on defining criteria related to relevant economic or social aspects over a longer or shorter period during which a gradual lockdown exit strategy is applied. The latter seeks to combine health benefits and reduced economic costs, and thus strike a balance.",

Logical reasoning would initially lead us to consider that equal measures give rise to equal results. However, nothing could be further from the truth when it is scientifically evaluated. A country succeeds in reducing daily infections of COVID-19 by lockdown strategies. Yet in areas of the country where no infections have occurred it has failed to reduce anything. Isolating those infected, social distancing, frequent hand-washing, wearing a face mask, avoiding concentrations of people in confined places, preventing long distance travel, etc., are measures that have a similar effect in any area, while confining an entire population to their homes can have a negligible effect in a rural area but a very significant one in a large city like Madrid or Barcelona. The same measures give different results depending on the initial conditions and the environment. From our point of view, a lockdown de-escalation strategy must aim to achieve the same results, but not to apply the same measures. This should be so because we must not incur excessive and avoidable economic costs. The strategy proposed here adapts to this way of looking at the problem, and is closer to the viewpoint of the person who must make the decision.",

In other words, the most plausible forecasts for the coming months suggest there will be sharp falls in GDP and increases in public deficit as needs grow.

May 25, 2020): the inner areas of bars and restaurants will be opened with a third of their capacity, provided there are \"guarantees of separation and only for table service\". The school year will start in September, but in this phase, exceptions are established to reopen educational centres. They may open for reinforcement activities, so as to ensure that children under the age of six can go to the school if both parents must work on site. School will open for university entrance examinations. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, and other similar spaces will reopen with \"preassigned seats\" and seating will be limited to one third of the usual capacity. People will also be able to visit monuments and exhibition halls, with the same restrictions on capacity. In addition, cultural shows such as concerts can be held in closed spaces, with one third of the usual capacity. If they are outdoors, up to 400 people will be allowed to congregate if they are seated. The capacity of places of worship is limited to 50%, as opposed to the one third of the previous phase. Hunting and sport fishing will resume. Face masks are compulsory on public transport.",
