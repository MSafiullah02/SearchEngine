Worldwide, there is a limited supply of N95 respirator masks, face shields, ventilator valves, testing kits and other personal protective equipment (1) (2) . Thus, adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic. To address these shortages, threedimensional (3D) printing, a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures, is well suited. 3D printing is an adjustable, robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

The semicrystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3D printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3D printing difficult. Material extrusion 3D printing was used to design a 3D printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene (PP) and styrene-(ethylenebutylene)-styrene (SEBS) (5) . This blend provides better printability and flexibility for N95 mask design. PP is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost, processability, printability, recyclability and mechanical integrity. SEBS is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion (5) . Thus, the PP/SEBS combination would improve the processability of 3D printed N95 masks. Moreover, controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3D model material for better fitted masks. 3D melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create PP microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3D form (3, 6) . Thus, 3D printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible N95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands. Figure 1 displays a potential N95 3D printed mask prototype.",
