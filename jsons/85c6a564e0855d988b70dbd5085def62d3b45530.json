The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO. A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by Spe-cialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine. An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.

In that study, 63% of patients (57/90) allocated to consideration for treatment using ECMO survived to 6 months without disability compared with 47% (41/87) of those allocated to conventional management.",

The patient was isolated, tested for COVID-19, and found to be positive. She was soon reintubated and was transferred to a tertiary care center near Denver, Colorado on March 13, 2020.

Nevertheless, the role of ECMO in the management of these challenging patients remains unclear. Here, we report on our recent initial experience in 32 severely ill COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise, some of whom also developed severe cardiac compromise. Although readily deployed, our initial experience demonstrated that 22 of 32 patients are alive (68%), with 17 of 32 (53.1%) alive on ECMO, although with only five of 15 (33.3%) surviving to date post-ECMO removal. Although our early limited experience does not allow for subgroup analysis, it is important to note that all five survivors were supported with only venoveno ECMO. Thus, the survival of patients treated with only veno-venous ECMO and separated from veno-venous ECMO is five out of 12 (41.7%)-outcomes that are reasonable in the context of contemporary use of ECMO for ARDS in adults. 6 Our hope is that this early experience will provide information about the real-world results of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and facilitate decision-making at the bedside. Further, this analysis will inform and drive future research to improve outcomes. Out of this analysis and subsequent experience with ECMO, insight will arise as to the appropriate role, timing, and utility of ECMO in patients with severe COVID-19.",

Our analysis of 32 patients from nine hospitals reveals that ECMO may play a meaningful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.

All five of the survivors are extubated, and one has been discharged from the hospital on room air. Thus, five out of 15 patients (33.33%) who have been decannulated so far have survived.

Ultimately, the situation of each patient will need to be individualized by the local team with consideration of the physiologic needs, comfort in cannulation and cannula management (especially since some of these patients might be considered for prone positioning), as well as available resources. There may be some debate regarding cannula types and locations of vascular access in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is important to remember that the causative pathogen of COVID-19 is highly contagious and transmitted typically via respiratory droplets/fomites (although there are some concerns for other modes of viral transmission). 7 Therefore, it is critical that at the time of cannulation, strict sterile technique along with respiratory droplet isolation precautions, including negative airflow isolation, be adhered to by the cannulating and management team. Cannulation in the context of COVID-19 is performed with full airborne and droplet precautions. The cannulation team is restricted to the surgeon, one assistant, and the perfusionist and is performed in a negative pressure room. All team members must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, beyond the sterile gowns, gloves, and hats used in the operating room, including appropriate N-95 masks and full protective eye-wear. 18 Ultrasound-guided access of the right internal jugular vein and right femoral vein can minimize the duration of cannulation. Avoiding the use of dual lumen bicaval cannulas will decrease the need for either TEE or fluoroscopy, each of which may unnecessarily increase exposure and time. Another potential strategy is to position the isolated patient with the ECMO console facing towards a window so that the ECMO specialist is able to view the control panel and parameters without having to stay in the room, thereby minimizing patient contact and potential pathogen exposure.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 have a cytokine storm syndrome in which a cascade of activated cytokines leads to harmful autoamplifying inflammatory cytokine production. 20.,21., 22 Termed the \"cytokine storm,\" this response often leads to organ damage and increases the risk of death. Among COVID-19 patients which have received ECMO, a strong positive correlation exists between mortality and high cytokine levels, most notably IL-6. 15,22-24 Ruan et al 24 documented that IL-6 concentrations differed significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors of COVID-19, with nonsurvivors having up to 1.7-times higher values. 22 Multiple therapeutic strategies might mitigate \"cytokine storm,\" including antibody therapies (e.g., Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, Siltuximab), therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and even direct removal of cytokines. TPE can reduce cytokine levels by separating and removing plasma from blood and replacing the removed plasma with fresh frozen plasma. 25 CytoSorb (https://cytosorbents.com/products/cyto-sorb/) is an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber that has been approved in the European Union to reduce toxic levels of cytokines; this technology might be combined with ECMO to treat cytokine storm associated with sever COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial experience with this approach has recently been reported. 26, 27 It is a fact that each of these theoretical treatment options merit additional investigation.",
