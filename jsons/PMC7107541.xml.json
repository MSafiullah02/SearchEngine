By the 1980s, this \u201ctransition bias\u201d was well known (Li et al. 1985). By the 1990s, systematists had noted effects on phylogeny inference (Wakeley 1996), and methods were revised to give more weight to transversion differences (Sinsheimer et al. 1997).",

            "text": "In many early works, this bias is presented as a ratio of differences, which makes the expected effect a complex function of the degree of sequence divergence. As the use of rate models became routine in comparative sequence analysis, the phenomenon of transition bias was redefined as a bias in instantaneous rates, relative to a null model of equal rates. Because every nucleotide site (e.g., a G site) may experience 1 type of transition (G\u2192A) at rate \u03b1, and 2 types of transversion (G\u2192C, G\u2192T) at rate \u03b2, the aggregate rate ratio of transitions to transversions has a null expectation of R = \u03b1/(2\u03b2) = 0.5. In some contexts, the ratio is expressed differently as \u03ba = \u03b1/\u03b2 = 1. When considering amino acid changes, it is more relevant to compare the 116 possible transitions and 276 possible transversions that change a codon so as to encode a different amino acid (assuming the canonical genetic code), leading to a null expectation of R = 116\u03b1/(276\u03b2) = 0.42\u03b1/\u03b2. Thus, the observation of roughly equal numbers of inferred transitions and transversions in classic works (Vogel and Kopun 1977), or in the extensive analysis of mammalian genes in Li (1997, table 7.2), indicates a bias of over 2-fold. Kumar (1996) estimates 2-fold to 5-fold rate biases in vertebrate mitochondrial genes (excluding 3rd positions). Other estimates may be found in the work cited by Rosenberg et al. (2003), but there is not (to our knowledge) a systematic contemporary review of this issue.",

This hypothesis was bolstered when DNA sequence comparisons revealed that a transition bias is observed in introns, pseudogenes, and other noncoding regions (Gojobori et al. 1982; Li et al. 1985), suggesting a cause that (like mutation) acts at the level of DNA, across the entire genome.",

For the mutational hypothesis, the existence of an underlying bias is indicated in direct studies of mutation (Schaaper and Dunn 1991; Lynch 2010; Schrider et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2014), and by many indirect estimates based on the assumption of neutral sequence divergence (Petrov and Hartl 1999; Rosenberg et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2004; Jiang and Zhao 2006; Morton et al. 2006), although Keller et al. (2007) report a lack of bias in grasshoppers. The bias typically is 2-fold to 4-fold over null expectations. In theory, a bias in mutation of magnitude B can cause a B-fold effect on the rate of evolution (Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2001; McCandlish and Stoltzfus 2014). That is, the observed magnitude of mutation bias appears to be sufficient, in principle, to account for the observed evolutionary bias.",

In a comparative evaluation, EX was shown to be as powerful, or more powerful, than a representative sample of other predictors (Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2005).

There is another point where AUC = 0.5 (no power) and evolutionary bias = 1 (no effect). We can fill in the relationship further by randomizing UB, as shown in figure 3. The results show that, when about 75 % of the values are randomized, UB has an AUC of 0.53, equal to that of the transition:transversion distinction. This corresponds to an evolutionary bias of 1.3. The CI of AUC from 0.50 to 0.56 for the transition:transversion distinction corresponds to the interval of 1.0 to 1.6 in evolutionary bias. That is, the expected evolutionary effect of the transition:transversion bias is a 1.3-fold bias, with a CI of 1.0 (no effect) to 1.6. This makes it unlikely that selection plays the major role in causing the evolutionary transition:transversion bias, which typically is several-fold favoring transitions.\n",

The idea of mutation and selection as opposing forces suggests that mutation bias will be influential only when selection is absent, thus hypotheses that invoke mutation bias are often interpreted as neutral models (as noted by Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2001). Presumably, this is why researchers have pursued selective explanations for transition:transversion bias among amino acid changes, even while accepting a mutational explanation for noncoding changes in the same genes: the proteins are assumed to be \u201cunder selection\u201d and thus not susceptible to mutation bias. However, this way of depicting mutation and selection as opposing forces is only justified under the special conditions of the gene pool regime. Outside of this regime, mutation and selection can both contribute to orientation or direction in evolution (Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2001; McCandlish and Stoltzfus 2014).",

Indeed, Vogel and Kopun themselves favored a mutational explanation for the evolutionary bias on the grounds that the effect size for conservativeness of transitions seemed to be too small (see hypothesis 3 on p. 179). Zhang\u2019s (2000) analysis of three possible conservative:radical distinctions finds that the distinction based on Miyata et al (1979) yields the largest evolutionary effect size, which is a 2-fold effect, that is, radical replacements are roughly half as likely to accumulate, relative to null expectations. However, although the effect of conservativeness is 2-fold, the link reported between transitions and conservativeness is weak. According to Zhang (2000), the chance that a transition is conservative by Miyata\u2019s measure is 35 %, compared with 33 % for transversions, a proportional difference of only 6 % (i.e., 2/33 = 0.06). Miyata-conservativeness may be a 2-fold evolutionary effect, but if transitions are only 6 % more Miyata-conservative than transversions, the overall bias will be far less than 2-fold.",

Converting a continuous measure of similarity into a binary measure is a simple matter of assigning all values above a particular quantile to the conservative class, and the rest to the radical class.

In ROC analysis of a binary classifier, each instance has a binary state (e.g., disease vs. nondisease), and the classifier makes a ranking of instances and predicts the binary state based on a threshold. The ROC curve plots the true-positive rate against the false-negative rate as the threshold varies, and the area under this curve is equivalent to the chance that a randomly chosen positive instance is ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative one (Hanley and McNeil 1982). If we treat the mutant fitness study as the classifier that supplies a ranking for each mutant, and the conservative-radical distinction as the binary state of a mutant, then the AUC is the chance that a mutant of a nominally conservative type has a higher fitness than a randomly chosen mutant of a nominally radical type. The relationship of AUC to the Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test is explained by Hanley and MacNeil (1982). Calculating AUC from the test statistic is an algebraic conversion based on the formula AUC = (pairs \u2212 WMW_statistic(x, y))/pairs, where x and y are vectors representing the two samples, and pairs = length(x) \u00d7 length(y). This formula applies specifically to wilcox.test in the R stats package (some other implementations define the test statistic in a different way).",

Under the conservative transitions hypothesis, one might expect that, even if there is no advantage over the entire distribution, an advantage will appear at the high end. In fact, this is not observed. As mentioned in the text, AUC = 0.53 for the complete set of data, corresponding to a truncation threshold of 0, that is, no truncation.
