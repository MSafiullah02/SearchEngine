The WHO has declared a public health emergency of international concern considering rapid increases in numbers of confirmed cases in China and additional countries. As of February 22, 2020, a total of 12 938 patients had been confirmed outside of Wuhan and related regions in Hubei province of China [1]. However, there is limited information about COVID-19 outside of Wuhan [5], and no study has reported the time to RT-PCR conversion and radiological changes after treatment.",

The final date of follow-up was February 7, 2020. Throat-swab specimens were collected and sent to the Henan center for disease control and prevention and SARS-CoV-2 detected by real-time RT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on admission and at the time of RT-PCR conversion. Data were collected from electronic medical records, with epidemiological and symptom data confirmed by directly communicating with patients or their family members (interviews conducted by L.W. and L.L.L.). The date of symptom onset referred to the day when the symptom was noted. Time to real-time RT-PCR conversion was calculated from the date of symptom onset to the day when SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable from two consecutive throat-swab specimens. Patients could be discharged from hospital when they had RT-PCR conversion and no fever for at least 3 days according to the interim guidance from Chinese National Heath Commission on clinical management of COVID-19 [6]. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, with a waiver of written informed consent.",

The patterns of radiological appearance were bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations [7]. All these features resemble with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8, 9]. However, patients with COVID-19 can present as mild disease or even no symptom, and no lung abnormalities or severe pneumonia on chest CT images. We reported a family cluster infection and some confirmed cases did not have comorbidities and the history of visiting to Wuhan, suggesting human-to-human transmission has been occurred outside of Wuhan regardless of age and underlying conditions [10\u201312]. Compared with patients in Wuhan, the manifestations of patients in Henan province are relatively mild [2\u20134], which was consistent with 13 case series of COVID-19 in Beijing [5]. Notably, transmission in asymptomatic carrier has been reported [12], which might pose more threat than symptomatic patients to epidemic prevention and control.",

Previous studies in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV showed that viral RNA could be detected in clinical specimens in patients >30 days after symptom onset [13, 14]. It was worth mentioning that we only used the throat-swab specimen to detect the viral RNA. Evidence have showed that SARS-CoV-2, SARS or MERS RNA could be detected in both upper and lower respiratory tract samples, even in blood, stool and urine specimens [2, 13, 14]. Because lower respiratory tract was thought to be the main target of coronavirus and viral RNA level is often higher in the lower respiratory tract specimen [15], we should be cognizant of the potential for prolonged viral shedding in the lower respiratory tract. Further data on ascertaining the duration of infectivity of COVID-19 by monitoring RT-PCR status in differing levels of severity using multiple clinical specimens are merited. Nevertheless, patients with COVID-19 should continue to follow hygiene measures after discharge from hospital, including wearing a surgical mask, disinfection of food utensils and toilet disinfection. For patients with mild pneumonia, radiological abnormalities were significantly improved in most patients after RT-PCR conversion. However, the consistency between RT-PCR conversion and the resolution of lung abnormalities requires further studies in patients with critical illness.",
