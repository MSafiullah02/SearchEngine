            "text": "During the last 25 years, large numbers of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been produced that have facilitated the purification and functional characterization of a plethora of leukocyte surface molecules. The antibodies have been even more useful as markers for cell populations, allowing the counting, separation, and functional study of numerous subsets of cells of the immune system. A series of international workshops were instrumental in coordinating this development through multi\u2010laboratory \u201cblind\u201d studies of thousands of antibodies. These HLDA (Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens) Workshops have, up until now, defined 500 different entities and assigned them cluster of differentiation (CD) designations. These are listed in Table 1.",

The latest workshop (the eighth) was held in Adelaide, Australia, in December 2004 (Zola et al., 2005), and was followed by a smaller Workshop intended to tie up a few loose ends (Zola et al., 2007a). The smaller Workshop used the name HCDM (Human Cell Differentiation Molecules), which was regarded as more representative of the expanded aims of the organization. However, the name HLDA is widely known and recognized. The next workshop, organized by Pablo Engel, will be referred to as HLDA9 and is currently being planned. HLDA9 will conclude with a meeting in Barcelona, Spain in 2009. Details of the 9th Workshop will be placed on the HLDA/HCDM Web site at http://www.HLDA8.org (also accessible as http://www.hcdm.org).",

            "text": "Initially, CD designation was intended to describe a cluster of MAbs that display the same cellular reactivity and identify the same molecular species. For instance, CD2 MAbs are reagents that react with a 50\u2010kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on resting T cells. Later, the CD designations were used to describe the recognized molecules, but had to be clarified by attaching the term antigen or molecule to the designation (e.g., CD2 molecule; Knapp et al., 1989). Currently, CD2 is generally used to designate the molecule, and CD2 antibody is used to designate the antibody.",

Although extensive, this table can provide only selected information. In particular, it was sometimes difficult to select exemplary MAbs to list. For some CD clusters, only a few MAbs are as yet characterized, but for others, the number of antibodies assigned in the Workshops is considerable. In addition, brief remarks concerning the molecular and/or functional characteristics of CD molecules and CD MAbs are included. For further details, the reader is referred to the extensive and well\u2010documented proceedings of the individual Workshops (Bernard et al., 1984; Reinherz et al., 1986; McMichael et al., 1987; Knapp et al., 1989; Schlossman et al., 1995; Kishimoto et al., 1997; Mason et al., 2002, Zola et al., 2005, 2007a,b). Protein Reviews on the Web (PROW) is a database established by Stephen Shaw accessible via the Internet at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PROW/, which provides authoritative peer\u2010reviewed summaries and links to genome and protein databases. Finally, more detailed information on every CD molecule is compiled in the book Leukocyte and Stromal Cell Molecules (Zola et al., 2007), while the HLDA Web site (http://www.hlda8.org) provides links to a variety of molecular databases on the Web.",
