Within the genus Parvovirus, there are several closely related viruses including feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), mouse minute virus (MMV), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) (Hueffer and Parrish, 2003, Steinel et al., 2001). FPV has been known since the 1920s, whereas CPV only emerged as a dog pathogen in the late 1970s (Appel et al., 1979, Carmichael and Binn, 1981). The origin of CPV is still not clear but it is arguable that CPV originated from FPV or a very closely related carnivore parvovirus (Barker et al., 1983, Horiuchi et al., 1998, Hueffer et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The important difference between these two parvoviruses is that FPV varies at a slow rate by random genetic drift, whereas CPV shows genomic substitution rates similar to those of RNA viruses, with values of about 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year under selection pressure (Hoelzer et al., 2008, Shackelton et al., 2005). Evidence suggests that the original type 2 (CPV-2) came from FPV infecting only cats in 1978, and gave rise to the antigenic variant CPV-2a through five or six amino acid mutations in the major capsid protein VP2 during 1979\u20131981 (Parrish et al., 1988, Parrish et al., 1985). A second variant, CPV-2b, was identified in 1986, which naturally infects dogs and cats (Parrish et al., 1991). A third variant, CPV-2c, was discovered in Italy in 2000, displaying an exceptional ability to spread rapidly through the canine population in that country (Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Martella et al., 2005), as well as in other European countries, Asia (Nakamura et al., 2004) and America (Kapil et al., 2007). Although the first reports suggested a low pathogenicity of CPV-2c, experimental data and field observations now indicate a more severe clinical course and higher mortality rates associated with CPV-2c infection, as well as an ability to infect and cause disease in adult dogs, even if repeatedly vaccinated (Decaro et al., 2008a).",

These amino acid changes affect the viral surface structure facilitating replication in canine cells and leading to loss of the feline host range (Parker and Parrish, 1997). Amino acids at positions 80, 93, 103, 323, 564 and 568 of VP2 are conserved among all CPV and FPV viruses (Steinel et al., 2000, Decaro et al., 2008a, Decaro et al., 2008b). CPV sequences at amino acid positions 93, 103 and 323 are critical for the ability to replicate in the dog, whereas the FPV sequence at amino acids 80, 564 and 568 are required for replication in the cat. The feline host range of the new antigenic types CPV-2a and CPV-2b is most likely determined by amino acid changes at positions 87, 300 and 305 (Truyen et al., 1996, Parrish, 1999). Amino acid differences at positions 87, 300 and 305 define the new antigenic types CPV-2a and -2b. Amino acid 426 is conserved in FPV, CPV-2 and CPV-2a viruses but is different in CPV-2b virus (Parrish et al., 1991, Steinel et al., 2000). The amino acids at positions 323 and 564 of VP2 from the isolated parvovirus are identical with those of CPV, and the other eight positions are identical to FPV (Table 2). The amino acid changes at positions 323 and 564 of VP2 from FPV may alter the host range of FPV, gaining the ability to infect monkeys, but this remains to be determined. The parvovirus HI titers in the monkeys indicated that these monkeys have certain anti-FPV antibody titers, which did not effectively protect against FPV infection. However, the recovered monkeys can produce higher anti-FPV antibody titers and can protect against FPV infection.",
