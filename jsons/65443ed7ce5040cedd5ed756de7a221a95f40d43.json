The title, abstract and full text of documents identified according to these search criteria were analyzed and those reporting information on the hemoglobin values in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease (i.e., those needing mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or those who died), were meta-analyzed. The reference list of all documents was examined to identify additional eligible studies. The final meta-analysis entailed the estimation of the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of hemoglobin values between subjects with or without severe disease. The statistical analysis was performed with the MetaXL software, Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia). The mean and standard deviation of each study were extrapolated from the data of sample size, median and interquartile range (IQR), as suggested by Hozo et al. 4 Overall, 80 items were originally detected, according to our search criteria, but 77 of these were excluded because they were review articles (n = 6), commentaries or other editorial material (n = 1), did not specifically deal with COVID-19 disease (n = 62), or did not provide hemoglobin levels in COVID-19 patients, with or without severe disease (n = 8). One more study was detected from the reading the reference list of selected articles, so that a final number of four studies were included in our meta-analysis, 5-8 totaling 1210 COVID-19 patients (224 with severe disease; 18.5%). The primary endpoint was defined as a composite of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need of mechanical ventilation or death in the study by Guan et al., 5 ICU admission in the study by Huang et al., 6 death in the study by Yang et al. 7 and the need for mechanical ventilation in the study by Young et al. 8 The heterogeneity among the studies was high (i.e., I 2 , 81%; p < 0.001).",

First, initial assessment and longitudinal monitoring of hemoglobin values seems advisable in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereby a progressive decrease in the hemoglobin concentration may reflect a worse clinical progression. Subsequently, studies shall be urgently planned to assess whether transfusion support (e.g., with administration of blood or packed red blood cells) may be helpful in this clinical setting to prevent evolution into severe disease and death.
