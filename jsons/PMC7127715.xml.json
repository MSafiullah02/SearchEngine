As one of the countermeasures against these threat, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems have attracted attention. The use of UV radiation for germicidal purposes has a long history, but its practical application was only considered after the identification of UV radiation emission from discharge lamps in the early 20th century [1]. A number of infectious microorganisms and viruses that have been prevalent at the time, such as influenza and tuberculosis, were shown to be effectively inactivated by UV radiation [2], [3]. For example, Wells had performed several initial experiments showing the germicidal effect of UV radiation in combating airborne infectious microorganisms as done by other researchers [4]\n[5]. His book, published in 1954, was one of the first comprehensive sources that described the characteristics of airborne infectious diseases and the effective usage of UV radiation [6].",

            "text": "UVGI systems used to disinfect indoor air are mainly divided into two types, upper room (UR)-UVGI and in-duct (ID)-UVGI systems [7]. A ID-UVGI system can be an effective countermeasure when infectious microorganisms pass through air conditioning units or ducts during the contagion stage. On the other hand, a UR-UVGI system installed in a room begins to inactivate infectious airborne microorganisms, as soon as they are emitted from one or more sources and exposed to UV rays in the room, due to proximity. This inactivation can prevent the dispersion of airborne microorganisms not only in the room but also to other rooms. The position of the UR-UVGI systems is restricted to locations safe for occupants, such as the upper part of the room, and several horizontal louvers are usually placed in front of UVC lamps to ensure horizontal UVC rays only radiate the upper part of the room, because UVGI systems use the ultraviolet C-band (UVC) with wavelengths in the range 200\u2013280 nm. This wavelength range has a germicidal effect on a wide range of microorganisms, but is also known to possibly cause skin redness and eye irritation when overexposed to humans [8]. Therefore, it is important to identify factors such as the airflow transferring air from the lower space to the upper space and the distribution of UVC intensity from the UR-UVGI system. Experimental methods using less harmful microorganisms in full-scale chambers have been employed to evaluate the germicidal efficacy of UR-UVGI [9], [10], [11], but it is costly and slow to evaluate and design UR-UVGI systems using experimental methods at the design stage. Therefore, numerical methods have been applied by several studies [12], [13].",

The germicidal effect of the UR-UVGI system can be estimated using the calculated UV dose. An existing method for calculating the ventilation efficiency was reviewed first to elucidate how the new method for calculating UV dose was modified from the existing method. The UV dose of the air constantly exhaled from a patient can be calculated using this method in a room with a steady state airflow distribution. The newly proposed method was illustrated with a ward model, and the relationship between the calculated UV doses and the ventilation efficiency was discussed.",

The overall ventilation efficiency has customarily been measured using a trace gas method. Sandberg introduced the concept of the age of air, the mean time elapsed before fresh air introduced into a room reaches a specific point to evaluate local ventilation efficiency [15]. However, measuring the age of air is very tedious work, even in an small enclosed room. Therefore, Kato et al. [16] introduced a numerical simulation method to estimate the local age of air in a room with steady state flow and diffusion fields. The scale of ventilation efficiency 3 (SVE3) corresponding to the local age of air, among several terms introduced by Kato, defines the mean traveling time required by the air mass from a supply opening to reach a specific point in a room. The SVE3 can be calculated using the contaminant concentration at a point under conditions of uniform contaminant generation throughout a room and fresh air intake from supply openings. Because the SVE3 is normalized by the nominal ventilation time, the SVE3 of ventilation systems with different air exchange rates can be compared with each other.",

In the process of calculating the SVE3\u2217, if the air from the specific supply opening is assumed to be a contaminant, the mass ratio of the contaminant at a given point is defined as the contribution ratio of the supply opening at that point. The contribution ratio was previously defined as the SVE4 by Kato et al. [18].

Their relationship has been expressed in terms of an exponential decay equation [19].(4)SR=e\u2212kDwhere, SR is the survival rate and k is the UV rate constant [m2/J] that indicates the UV susceptibility of each microorganism or virus. A higher UV rate constant means that a microorganism or a virus is more easily inactivated by UV rays. The UV rate constant varies with the type of microorganism and virus; however, in general, it is known to be higher for viruses and bacteria than fungi [7], as shown in Table 1\n. Therefore, UR-UVGI systems are not appropriate for the removal of airborne fungal spores, accounting for the low UV rate constants of fungal spores and short exposure time to UV. However, ID-UVGI systems are considered effective for surface disinfection of fungal spores because long exposure time is available in air conditioning systems. The UV rate constant can also vary with the environmental conditions when microorganisms and viruses are exposed to UV. Most bacteria and viruses are more susceptible to UV in air than in water [24], which enables UR-UVGI systems to inactivate them more effectively in air. Additionally, it is known that humidity can affect the UV susceptibilities of viruses and bacteria in air [25], [26], but the effect was neglected in this study because their relationship is not clearly identified yet.",

The four-patient ward has a squared supply opening with fresh air flowing toward each patient at the center of the ceiling as shown in Fig. 3 and has one or two exhaust openings, depending on the case. The supply air has a velocity of 4.18 m/s, corresponding to a ventilation rate of about 11 times per hour. The UR-UVGI system is installed on the wall at a height of 2.4 m either above the door or beside the window, depending on the case, to radiate the UVC only to the upper area of the ward. The spatial distribution of the UVC intensity radiated from UR-UVGI systems measured by Sung et al. [13] was used in this study. Patients, simplified as boxes with dimensions 0.4 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 1.7 m, were placed on the beds either near door or the window and were constantly exhaling contaminants at an airflow of 0.24 l/s from their mouths. The temperature of the exhaled air was set to 32 \u00b0C, and the heat generation of each patient\u2019s body was set to 24 W. Because the ward has absolute symmetry, only half of it was modeled for the calculation. Distributions of the airflow and the UV dose were calculated using a commercial CFD code, STAR-CD V.3.26 (CD-Adapco JAPAN Co., Ltd.), and the standard k-\u03b5 model was used as a turbulence model. The other boundary conditions of CFD simulation are shown in Table 2\n.",

The SVE3\u2217 values in the area of a neighboring patient indicate are comparatively low in the cases where patient A is a source, which means the air from patient A can reach the area of patient B more quickly than in reverse cases.
