            "text": "With respect to pathological features, the eosinophilic infiltration of intestinal mucosa is an uncommon finding in giardiasis (Abbas et al., 1994, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2004). However, the slight increase of IELs (Intra Epithelial Lymphocytes) observed in our case, could be consistent with the pathological pattern described by other authors in calves (Ruest et al., 1997, O\u2019Hadley et al., 2001). Eosinophilic enteritis could be idiopathic, due to parasitism or to hypersensitivity (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2004). Since no parasites other than G. duodenalis were identified in the lambs and there was no record of previous treatment that could have cleared a concurrent parasitic infection, it may be supposed that parasitism did not produce the observed eosinophilic infiltration, unless G. duodenalis was considered the primary cause of the lesion. As an alternative hypothesis, hypersensitivity could have played a significant role in the development of the lesion; intestinal tissue eosinophilia, in fact, may depend on the synthesis of chemotactic factors for eosinophils by lymphocytes, enterocytes or mast cells (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2004). Mast cells are important for rapid control of G. duodenalis infections in mice (Li et al., 2004) and mast cells hyperplasia is reported in Mongolian Gerbils experimentally infected with G. duodenalis (Hardin et al., 1997). These cells may be involved in the host response to the parasite by modulating a hypersensitivity reaction (Hardin et al., 1997). Consistently with this idea, soluble antigens of G. duodenalis have been demonstrated to elicit a Th2 response in mice, with production of IgE (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2004) and giardiasis in humans has been associated with both allergic responses and chronic urticaria (Li et al., 2004). However, further investigations are necessary to clarify the inflammatory pathways of the host response to G. duodenalis infection observed.",

It is well known that parasites classified as G. duodenalis, in spite of the lack of morphological differences, show a remarkable degree of genetic variation that allows to distinguish at least seven genetic groups, or Assemblages, having different host-specificity (Thompson and Monis, 2004). Farm animals, including sheep, are predominantly infected with the so-called hoofed genotype, or Assemblage E (Ey et al., 1997), but can also be infected with the zoonotic Assemblage A (van Keulen et al., 2002, Lalle et al., 2005, Ryan et al., 2005). However, infection with the zoonotic Assemblage B was not reported so far in sheep. Whether the severity of the clinical signs and the pathogenic effects observed in this case are due to the genetic background of the parasite remains to be proven.",
