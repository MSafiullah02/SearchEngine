The work must be carried out efficiently and risk-free even if the doors to the decontaminator are opened.Floors and walls must withstand strong disinfectants and frequent cleaning.Drain in the floor may be correct.There should be a large enough area for cleaning of wheelchairs, aids, etc., if the hospital does not have a separate cleaning facility or system for large equipment between patients.The disinfection unit may have its own clean storage room for cleaned and ready-to-use bedpans, urine bottles, flower glasses, cleaned walking chairs and other noncritical aids. This store room should not be used for clean textiles, sterile equipment, etc.!\n",
