The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 219 million cases for 2017, representing a 2 million case increase compared to 2016 [1]. Two hosts are involved in the parasite\u2019s biological cycle: the mosquito vector (where parasite sexual differentiation occurs) and the human host (where asexual replication prevails) [2]. The parasite\u2019s sexual phase (related to human-vector transmission) starts just after the female Anopheles mosquito\u2019s uptake of infected erythrocytes having parasite sexual forms (gametocytes) after biting an infected human. Sexual form fusion (macrogamete and microgamete) occurs inside the mosquito midgut; gametes then mate to form zygotes, which transform into ookinetes and embed themselves within insect midgut epithelial cells [3, 4]. Physiological conditions occur simultaneously during the ookinete stage thereby facilitating parasite mobility and oocyst formation and maturation; ookinetes differentiate into oocysts and release large amounts of sporozoites into the haemocoel upon maturation which are responsible for mosquito vector-human transmission [3, 5].",

Small quantities of gametocytes circulate in infected humans\u2019 bloodstreams, being exposed to the host immune system; ookinetes could come into contact with the mosquito\u2019s immune system that includes a complement-like immune response [8\u201310]. The host\u2019s immune response gradually controls Plasmodium dispersal by reducing the amount of circulating gametocytes and limiting parasite development inside the mosquito vector, making this Plasmodium sexual stage an important biological bottleneck [11, 12]. However, even with such biological control, natural response against the parasite leaves asymptomatic human parasite carriers (i.e. an important cause of transmission) [7, 8]. Parasite culture and the biological study of sexual-stage parasite antigens are important for identifying and selecting effective vaccine candidates to stop this never-ending infection cycle [13].",

Mosquito immune pressure generates genetic changes in P. falciparum, thereby enabling its gradual adaptation to mosquitoes from different geographical regions [11]. Parasite-vector interaction has been extensively followed up in African mosquitoes because of the ease of parasite isolate availability and the ease of establishing mosquito colonies to facilitate studying the mosquito\u2019s immune response [14\u201317]. Comparative analysis of parasite compatibility with mosquitoes from Africa and Southeast Asia has found parasite adaptive mechanisms regarding each Anopheles species; a similar approach has been followed with the Latin-American P. falciparum strain 7G8 and Anopheles albimanus [15]. Even so, knowledge is still lacking about the interaction of other Latin-American parasite strains with New World mosquitoes [18]. This has mostly been due to difficulties in establishing Anopheles colonies (from the New World, especially regarding epidemiologically important mosquito strains) and also the lack of parasite strains from this geographical area having characterized sexual differentiation capability [18\u201321].",

Carucci) and FCB2 parasite strains were cultured with O+ human erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 culture media, supplemented with human inactivated serum, in a 90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere [30]. The maintenance protocol of asexual and sexual forms of Delves et al. was followed [22]. Briefly, asexual parasite form culture was checked every 48 h, maintaining 0.5% culture parasitaemia in 4% haematocrit until gametocytes became mature (gametocyte stage V) after 12 to 15 days culture involving daily medium replacement, without adding fresh erythrocytes. The gametocytes were then tested regarding their sexual differentiation capability in vitro, using 100 \u00b5L gametocyte culture (stage V) at 27 \u00b0C for 20 min [31]. Samples were then spun at 2500 rpm for 3 min, pellets were analysed by Giemsa staining and gametes were visualized at 40\u00d7 using a Primo Star Carl Zeiss microscope [32].",

Moreover, long-time FCB2 strain in vitro culture could contribute to such low oocyst maturation; it was thus hypothesized that a controlled in vitro environment may induce genomic and/or transcriptomic changes affecting gametocyte production and oocyst maturation.

This study has analysed the P. falciparum Colombian FCB2 strain\u2019s sexual differentiation capability by initially verifying Pfap2g, Pfs16, Pfg27/25 and Pfs25 gene expression used for detecting infected patients who could have gametocytes and female parasite sexual forms (Fig. 1) [39\u201342, 60]. It is worth noting that the FCB2 strain has preserved its gametocyte production (although to a low degree: 0.2% gametocytes after 12 days culture) after more than 30 years of in vitro culture; it has conserved its characteristic phenotype during each gametocyte stage as seen in other sexually differentiated parasite strains (Fig. 2). These gametocytes were able to form zygotes and ookinetes and exflagellate after in vitro culture with low-temperature stimuli (Figs. 2, 3, 4).",

FCB2 strain gametocytes infected Colombian An. albimanus and An. stephensi using a controlled artificial mosquito feeding system; they differentiated into oocyst forms inside mosquito midgut, thereby confirming the conservation of the mosquitoes\u2019 infection ability (Figs. 6 and 8). It is known that culture conditions influence gametocyte formation, i.e. erythrocyte percentage, hypoxanthine and glucose concentration [22, 61, 62]. Serum also influences gametocyte production; gametocyte production and their infectivity become decreased when using serum replacement substances [63]. Probably, such conserved FCB2 gametocyte production could have been associated with culture maintenance conditions, mostly related to parasite culture media always being supplemented with human plasma and this might have helped conserve this feature. Considering the implications of in vitro culture conditions regarding gametocytogenesis, it could be supposed that such conditions may also affect oocyst growth-associated genes, thereby causing impaired development of most of FCB2 oocysts. Genetic comparative analysis comparing high (e.g. NF54) and low (e.g. FCB2) oocyst-producing strains may help to resolve this question and also support the study of possible targets for anti-malarial drugs and vaccine development.",

Nevertheless, variation in mosquito infectivity has been reported when using P. falciparum isolates from the same geographical area, e.g. African strain NF54 infected 90% of Anopheles gambiae, Kenyan strain K39 infected 86% of An. gambiae, whilst M24 infected only 6% of the same mosquito species [15, 66]. Such huge difference regarding mosquito infection might be explained by variations in parasite strain infection susceptibility associated with mosquito immune response; specifically, increased An. gambiae thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) has been shown to be involved in oocyst killing, whilst parasite polymorphism in the Pfs47 gene has enabled evading mosquito immune response [67].",

Mosquito innate immune defence mechanisms may influence midgut epithelial ookinete invasion [69, 70]; mosquito immune responses could thus be related to the aforementioned study\u2019s findings. Gametocytaemia, mosquito midgut xanthurenic acid concentration, haemozoin concentration, temperature and other intrinsic mosquito characteristics also influenced FCB2 sporogony formation inside An. albimanus midgut [36, 71]; this might explain the large amount of these forms found on initial days post-feeding compared to the small amount of such forms which finally developed. Moreover, the Anopheline late immune response against oocysts has been described in other mosquito species; haemocytes have been responsible for reduced parasite survival, using unknown mechanisms [72]. Studying haemocyte cell defence response in An. albimanus could be interesting for recognizing its cellular immunity.",
