Immunoglobulins, ribavirin, and palivizumab are suggested treatments for both pre-emptive and therapeutic purposes. However, in the absence of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, efficacy is controversial and there is toxicity as well as cost concerns. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of lower respiratory tract RSV infections in adult LTRs. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, combined with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or viral cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. RESULTS: Ten symptomatic patients were identified (7 men and 3 women, age range 28 to 64 years). All were hospitalized for community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Two patients had a concomitant acute Grade A3 graft rejection, and 1 patient had a concomitant bacterial pneumonia. Eight patients did not receive a specific anti-RSV treatment because of clinical stability and/or improvement at the time of RSV diagnosis. Only 2 patients (1 with Grade A3 allograft rejection and 1 requiring mechanical ventilation) received ribavirin and palivizumab. All patients recovered without complications and with no persistent RSV infection. However, bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) staging worsened in 6 patients during the mean follow-up of 45 months.

Previous studies suggested that severe RSV infections may occur early after transplantation when the immune response is most compromised. 6 However, a more recent study reported only 24% of infections during the first 3 months post-transplantation. 5 In our cohort, only 1 patient developed an RSV infection during the first 3 months post-transplantation.

Interestingly, half of these patients also experienced \u05463 post-RSV acute rejection episodes. Because of the small number of cases, and confounding rejection episodes, it remains difficult to ascertain the potential responsibility of RSV infections in the development and/or worsening of BOS in our cohort. However, this warrants further investigation in large LTR cohorts. A possible causality between mild RSV infections that per se evolve favorably without specific treatment and BOS would potentially have major diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Indeed, such an association would support screening for RSV in LTRs, even those with mild symptoms. Moreover, one would have to establish in controlled trials whether specific anti-RSV treatment could prevent BOS worsening in such conditions. One should not forget both the increased costs and potential adverse effects associated with specific RSV therapy. Immunoglobulins, 31,32 ribavirin, 33 and pavilizumab 34, 35 may all have significant adverse effects. In some studies the incidence of serious adverse effects of ribavirin was high, with hemolytic anemia occurring in 61% of treated patients. 36 In our study, none of the 2 patients treated with ribavirin developed serious adverse effects. Likewise, Pelaez et al reported only 1 episode of mild reversible anemia among LTRs treated with oral ribavirin for RSV. 37 They further suggested that oral ribavirin might be as efficient-but 20-fold less expensive-than nebulized ribavirin. Cost-effectiveness analyses for pavilizumab for the treatment of RSV infections in adults are missing. Such studies are presently available only for prophylaxis in infants, 38,39 who require much smaller doses than adults. 40 In conclusion, our observations support that LTRs without severe disease due to RSV, and without particularly enhanced immunosuppression (eg, anti-thymocyte globulins), do not necessarily require specific anti-viral treatment. This contrasts with previous reports and expert opinions, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] which favor early specific anti-RSV treatment in LTRs. However, most of these earlier studies were retrospective, included small numbers of patients, assessed several different respiratory viruses, and contained incomplete clinical information. Finally, many recommendations were derived from BMT recipients, 4,8 -17 who represent a clinically distinct patient population. We therefore suggest that LTRs positive for RSV at least 3 months after transplantation, with only minor clinical symptoms, may be observed carefully with a transient reduction of immunosuppression, and that a specific anti-RSV treatment be initiated only in cases of clinical deterioration. However, a randomized clinical trial is warranted to determine whether this less aggressive, step-by-step approach is safe, and does not expose LTRs to an increased risk of BOS development.",
