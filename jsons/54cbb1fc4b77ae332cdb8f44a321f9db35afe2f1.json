Articles on these costs often regard ex post the costs of pandemics and epidemics. For instance, Haacker (2004) discusses the economic costs of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, while Santaeulalia-Llopis (2008) focuses on the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on development. Yach, Stuckler, and Brownell (2006) discusses the costs of global growth of obesity and diabetes.",

            "text": "The degree of overlap of other disasters providing insight into the potential impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets has much to do with levels of spillover associated with other previous events. As COVID-19's impact will blanket the globe, it is useful to compare the COVID-19 situation to past events that, although more localized, have led to spillovers that have established general impacts. Research on the impact of terrorist events on the financial markets might provide some sort of parallel, as terrorist events, while localized in their initial manifestation are by their nature designed to create a widespread change in public mood. Karolyi (2006) discusses the \"spillover effects\" of terrorist attacks and whether research on this topic suggests a broad-based or \"systematic\" contribution of potential terrorism to overall risk. His conclusion is that the evidence is quite limited, but there have been few tests that have examined volatility or beta risks with asset-pricing models. Some papers suggest that the downturn in markets with respect to terrorist events is rather mild, with downturns only very short (Brounen and Derwall, 2010). Choudhry (2003) investigated, post September 11, a small number of US firms in a variety of different industries to see if this terrorist event affected a shift in market betas, with mixed findings. Hon, Strauss, and Yong (2004) find that the September 11 terrorist attacks led to an increase in correlations amongst global markets, with this effect varying by global region. A number of other papers present a mixed picture of how much terrorist acts have spilled over into changes in the nature of financial markets (e.g., Chesney, Reshetar, and Karaman, 2011; Choudhry, 2005; Corbet, Gurdgiev, and Meegan, 2018; Nikkinen and V\u00e4h\u00e4maa, 2010) . 4 COVID-19 is perhaps a unique outcome in terms of its global scope as a pandemic, at least since the influenza pandemic of 1918. But, as discussed above, a disaster on the scale of COVID-19 was not an extremely unlikely possibility. It is interesting to compare the COVID-19 outcome (thus far) to an imagined nuclear conflict. Nuclear conflict, unless one considers dubiously a very localized impact, is not survivable by anyone on Earth. Consequently, a threat of nuclear war, apart from signaling economically impacting international tensions, is widely seen as having almost no impact on market prices. The reason seems to be not because of its low probability, but because in the event of a non-survivable event other outcomes are irrelevant.",

But, unlike global nuclear conflict, COVID-19 is survivable and the value of financial markets will remain extremely relevant. It seems very likely that the next time there is a sudden appearance of a contagious respiratory illness, there will concomitantly be a substantial global financial market reaction.

            "text": "An issue that will likely be considered by researchers is how COVID-19 will potentially permanently change firm financing. As discussed above, COVID-19 highlights the possibility, or indeed the likelihood, of contagious disease events that will have tremendous negative impacts on global domestic demand. This is a game changer from financial markets neglecting to price the potentiality of horrific tailrisk events that would not be survivable anyway. COVID-19 and others like it are globally damaging to the world economy to a rarely precedented extent. But they are survivable. We should expect now that there will be a long-term impact on firm financing and firm costs of capital. Elnahas, Kim, and Kim (2018) find that firms located in more disaster-prone areas adapt to be less levered. Consistent with a trade-off view of capital structure (Kraus and Litzenberger, 1973) , they attribute this finding to firms being impacted in disastrous areas with respect to operating disruption, increased costs of capital, and tightened financial flexibility. While firms are often seen as persistent in their capital structure policy, they often respond to macroeconomic shocks (Huang, Gao, and Chen, 2018) . COVID-19 clearly suggests a previous underpricing of equity risk. Will this lead to firms adopting less leverage? Will there be a very long-term shifting in costs of equity? Lee and McKibbin (2004) find a 200-basis point increase in the country risk premium for China and Hong Kong following SARS. While the impact of country-risk premiums on costs of equity will vary with firm exposures to various markets, certainly, an increase of two percent points in a country risk premium (likely much higher for would lead to a significant increase in the cost of equity capital, with a concomitant underfunding of global pensions. But the findings of increased country risk of Lee and McKibbin (2004) for China and Hong Kong are based on China and Hong Kong being particular risk areas for SARS. With a genuine pandemic like COVID-19 however the exposure is global rather than in select countries.",
