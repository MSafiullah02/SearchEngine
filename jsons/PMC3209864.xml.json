These early explorers were sometimes driven by chance or curiosity, and sometimes by a problem for which no one had an answer at that point of time [1]. Now we know that microbes are pervasive. They are everywhere, in land, water and air. Microbes play a major role in the life history of humans, animals, and plants, in the quality and safety of our food supplies, in the health and sustainability of our air, land, and water; in bio-warfare and national security. Microbiology in twentieth century has evolved into an extremely interactive discipline among the sciences.",

It is estimated that nine out of ten cells in our body are microbes. Our own body microbes, collectively called as \u2018Human Microbiome\u2019, carry 100 times as many genes as our own DNA, and also exceed in sheer diversity of those genes [2]. Understanding how the magic balance between the gastrointestinal microbiota and human body influences human health and disease is of prime importance. Some microbes make us sick which is known to us since a very long time, but we realized only recently how the microbial genes affect how much energy we absorb from our foods [3] and how microbes and viruses modulate our immune system in a positive manner [4]. The understanding of variability between individuals and its implication will be one of the most challenging tasks, which will go far beyond understanding mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis in infectious diseases [5]. I have no doubt that the next few years will reveal remarkable findings related to our body microbiota, which will benefit public health tremendously. The use of probiotics, prebiotics, and neutraceuticals through-out the world, including India, has become widespread without any in-depth understanding of their use. However, the future will reveal to us the true relationship.",

According to an estimate more than 99% of microbes in the environment cannot be cultured in artificial media in the laboratory, a characteristic that limits our understanding of microbial physiology, genetics, molecular biology and community ecology [6]. One way to address this problem is metagenomics, the culture-independent cloning and analysis of microbial DNA extracted directly from an environmental sample. However, metagenomics has its limitation as is evident from several studies including the most ambitious one conducted by Craig Venter and coworkers [7] using water of the Sargasso Sea. For example, in the Sargasso Sea sequences, 69% of the ORFs could not be associated with known function. This analysis points to a major limitation in annotating sequences from uncultured microorganisms. Hence, a fundamental challenge in understanding microbial communities is to chronicle genetic conservation across time and location and to delineate the smallest complement of genes conserved in genomes across different communities.",

Anthrax is one such example. Pathogenic microorganisms are the cause of many infectious diseases of humans, animals and plants including agricultural crops. About 12 million people around the world die each year due to microbial diseases which could be prevented or cured through the use of vaccines or medication (World Health Organization). Approximately half of all deaths caused by infectious diseases each year can be attributed to just three diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS. Besides very dangerous human pathogens HIV-AIDS, anthrax, tuberculosis, dengue, polio, cholera, etc., there are several crop and animal pathogens which have potential to disrupt food supplies and pose threat to food security of the country. Therefore, the pathogenic microbiology has been one of the most important branches of microbiology since the times of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. The recent emergence of bird-flu and swine-flu, besides SARS, Ebola, Hanta, have amply demonstrated the deficiencies in tacking such diseases. Emergence of drug resistance and non-availability of effective chemotherapeutic agents against majority of the viral pathogens of humans and animals is an important area for enhancing global research and development efforts.",
