However, under the same assumptions, other important quantifiers such as the probability of a major outbreak, the final size, and the initial growth rate can depend on the variability of the infectious period, higher variability tending to decrease these quantities [1,2]. When accounting for the more realistic scenario where individuals can only make direct contacts to their neighbor in a contact network [3], R0 typically depends on the variability of the infectious period and, even when R0 is held fixed, the probability that any given individual will eventually get infected is still dependent on the variability of the infectious period [4]. Here we extend these results to a much more general epidemic model and consider the effect of the infectious period distribution on the probability P(A,t) that the disease will spread to an arbitrary subset A of the population by an arbitrary time t. This probability underpins the likelihood of an epidemic, and the speed and extent of its propagation.",

In choosing the parameter for this distribution, the modeler may try to replicate the estimated average infectious period or the estimated value for R0. In any case, the exponential distribution is typically not very realistic for this variable. For example, it has been suggested that gamma, Weibull, and degenerate (nonrandom) distributions may be more realistic for diseases such as smallpox, ebola, and measles [5\u20138]. Thus, investigating the effect of the infectious period distribution is important for obtaining a qualitative understanding of the ability of different diseases to propagate, and of the effects of intervention strategies which may modify this distribution. It is also important for informing parameter choices in epidemic models.",

We allow arbitrarily distributed exposed and infectious periods, heterogeneous contact processes between individuals, and heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectiousness. Many previously studied models such as Kermack-McKendrick [11], pairwise [12,13], message passing [10], and spatial models [4,14] are identical to, consistent with, or approximations of special cases of the stochastic model which we examine here [15].

The convex order, which provides a type of variability ordering for random variables with the same mean, is central to the paper that we present here. Our main result shows that, under mild assumptions, by changing the infectious period distributions such that they decrease in convex order, which necessarily decreases their variance, we can only increase P(A,t).

This is the case since we may define the infectious period, with specified mean, to be able to take only the value zero or some arbitrarily large number. Thus, the probability that the infectious period is zero may be set arbitrarily close to 1.",

It was shown that, under stronger assumptions than here, the long-term probabilities limt\u2192\u221eP(A,t) are not less in the model with the nonrandom infectious period. To relate more directly to this result, we define (following [17] and [18]) the \u201ctransmissibility\u201d to be the posterior probability that an infected individual, with a given infectious period, will make a contact to a given neighbor before recovering. Thus, the transmissibility is a random variable since it is a function of the infectious period, and its expected value is the transmission probability. We show that by changing the infectious period distribution such that the transmissibility is decreased in convex order, which we shall argue keeps R0 constant, we can only increase P(A,t).

Let G=(V,E) be an arbitrary simple undirected graph, where V is a finite or countably infinite set of vertices (individuals) and E is a set of undirected edges between the vertices. For i\u2208V, let Ni={j\u2208V:(i,j)\u2208E} be the set of neighbor of i and let |Ni|<\u221e for all i\u2208V (the graph is thus described as \u201clocally finite\u201d). We assume that two individuals are neighbor if and only if at least one can make direct contacts to the other. Let \u03bdi\u2208[0,\u221e] denote the time period that i spends in the exposed state; \u03bci\u2208[0,\u221e) is i's infectious period, i.e., the time period that i spends in the infectious state; \u03c9ji\u2208[0,\u221e] is the time elapsing between i first entering the infectious state and it making a sufficient (for transmission) contact to j (note that the sufficient contact is not infectious, i.e., cannot cause infection, if it occurs after i's infectious period has terminated); Wouti is some variable on which all of the sufficient contact times \u03c9ji(j\u2208Ni) may depend, e.g., a quantifier of i's infectiousness arising from sources other than the length of its infectious period (similar to Ii in [17]); Wini is some variable on which all of the sufficient contact times \u03c9ij(j\u2208Ni) may depend, e.g., a quantifier of i's susceptibility (similar to Si in [17]). For t\u2208[0,\u221e), i makes an infectious contact to j at time t if and only if (i) i enters the infectious state at some time s\u2264t, (ii) \u03c9ji=t\u2212s, and (iii) \u03c9ji\u2264\u03bci.

Assume that i gets infected and consider its behavior after it leaves the exposed state and immediately enters the infectious state, and also assume that all of the variables except i's infectious period \u03bci and the sufficient contact times \u03c9ji(j\u2208B) have already been drawn from their joint distribution. Let ix1...x|B|\u219b denote the event that i does not make an infectious contact to neighbor 1 within time period [0,x1] (since entering the infectious state), neighbor 2 within time period [0,x2], ..., and neighbor |B| within time period [0,x|B|], where the xj are arbitrary non-negative numbers. We may now write\n(1)P*(ix1...x|B|\u219b)=P(\u03c91i>min{x1,\u03bci},\u03c92i>min{x2,\u03bci},...,\u03c9|B|i>min{x|B|,\u03bci})=E[\u03d5(\u03bci)],where\n\u03d5(\u03c4)=\u220fj=1|B|\u03d5j(\u03c4)(\u03c4\u2208[0,\u221e)),and\n(2)\u03d5j(\u03c4)=P*(\u03c9ji>min{xj,\u03c4}).We use P* to indicate that we are conditioning on the values already drawn for the infectiousness and susceptibility variables Wouti and Winj(j\u2208B), since the sufficient contact times \u03c9ji(j\u2208B) may depend on these. The form of (2) may be understood by observing that if the infectious period \u03bci takes the value \u03c4 and \u03c4\u2265xj then any sufficient contact made from i to j within time period [0,xj] is an infectious contact. Thus, for no infectious contact to j within time period [0,xj] we need \u03c9ji to be greater than xj. On the other hand, if \u03c4<xj then the only sufficient contacts made within time period [0,xj] which are infectious are those made in the smaller time period [0,\u03c4].

It is convex if \u03d5j(\u03c4) is convex for all j\u2208B, since the \u03d5j(\u03c4) are non-negative and nonincreasing. Further, \u03d5j(\u03c4) is convex if the survival function for \u03c9ji, after conditioning on any possible values for Wouti and Winj, is convex; note that a nonincreasing probability density function (PDF) is sufficient for a convex survival function. If contact processes are independent Poissonian processes, which is a common assumption, then the \u03c9ji are exponential and thus have convex survival functions. If the \u03c9ji are independent and gamma distributed with shape parameters less than or equal to 1 then their survival functions will be convex. We also note that the survival function for the heavy-tailed Lomax distribution f(x)=(1+x/\u03bb)\u2212\u03b1, where \u03bb,\u03b1>0, is convex on [0,\u221e). Moreover, since f(x)=x\u2212\u03b1, where \u03b1>0, is convex on (0,\u221e) then sufficient contact times \u03c9ji which have other heavy-tailed distributions may have convex survival functions. This is of relevance since it has been shown how processes which depend on human decision making may develop interevent times which have heavy-tailed distributions, and data for some such processes do indeed indicate heavy tails [19]. Alternatively, if \u03c9ji is the residual waiting time of a renewal process which governs the times at which i makes sufficient contacts to j then it follows that the PDF for \u03c9ji is nonincreasing.

Again, this follows similarly from the graphical sufficient condition for the convex order.

So if we restrict our distributions to one of these two families, and keep the means fixed, then decreasing the variances of the infectious periods can only increase P(A,t). An illustration of the extent of this increase, for the case of the gamma distribution, is shown in Fig. 1 where we have computed the expected number susceptible at time t as \u2211i\u2208V[1\u2212P({i},t)]. The effect is remarkable when one considers that the mean is fixed and we have just interpolated between the exponential distribution and the degenerate distribution, both of which are commonly assumed for the infectious period.

Using the graphical sufficient condition for the convex order, this means that when the transmission probabilities (E[Zi] for all i\u2208V) and R0 are fixed, Smes(i)(t) is minimized when infectious periods are nonrandom and maximized when infectious periods may be only zero or infinite. Note that in the former case the CDFs for the infectious periods are Heaviside step functions while in the latter case they are constant on [0,\u221e).",

Here, the transmission probability is the same for all ordered pairs of neighbor and kept constant at 1\u2212e\u22123/4\u22480.53, giving R0\u22483\u00d70.53=1.59. For k=1,2,4,and4000, the mean of the infectious period is approximately 1.1, 0.91, 0.82, and 0.75, with variance 1.2, 0.41, 0.17, and 0.00014, respectively. In (c) we have plotted the probability density function for the infectious period for each value of k. It is straightforward that the transmissibility variable (which is a function of the infectious period) here decreases in convex order as k increases.",
