Deep sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples revealed the identity of the causative agent as a newly emerged strain of betacoronavirus, temporarily named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (ICTV, 2020). As of March 23, there have been approximately 81,601 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China with over 3,276 deaths (WHO, 2020b). The SARS-CoV-2 has been found to have high human-to-human transmission through close contact with infected patients, leading to rapid global spread by infected travelers from China. As of March 23, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 cases have been confirmed in at least 171 countries with a steady increase in the number of laboratory confirmed cases (251,329 cases) outside of China suggesting that non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies have not ultimately been successful in limiting spread. Therefore, an animal model that recapitulates the COVID-19 clinical symptoms in human infection is urgently needed in order to decipher the transmission routes and pathobiology of this virus and to allow testing of pharmaceutical interventions.",

Correspondingly, Bao et al. (2020) reported weight loss and virus replication in lungs of hACE2 transgenic mice following SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, no other clinical symptoms such as cough or fever were observed. In order to understand the rapid spreading characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, additional animal models that mimic high human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections are warranted. Given that ferret ACE2 has been shown to contain critical SARS-CoV binding residues (Wan et al., 2020), we performed infection and direct and indirect contact transmission studies using a ferret model previously developed for influenza virus infections (Park et al., 2018; Bouvier, 2015).",

To evaluate the transmission mode of the virus, naive ferrets (n = 2/group) were placed in direct contact (DC) (co-housed) or indirect contact (IC) (housed in cages with a permeable partition separating them from infected ferrets) with infected ferrets two days after the primary infection. Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded.

While reduced activity was observed in NMC-nCoV02-infected ferrets between 2 and 6 dpi with occasional coughs, there was no detectable body weight loss, nor were there any fatalities during the experimental period. Interestingly, all six DC ferrets showed increased body temperatures (\u223c39\u00b0C) with reduced activity between 4 and 6 days post contact (dpc) and no detectable body weight loss (Figures S1A and S1B). However, none of the IC ferrets showed increased body temperature or weight loss over the 12 days of the studies (Figures S1C and S1D). These data indicate that the efficient establishment of COVID-19 clinical features in ferrets exposed to infected animals requires direct contact, recapitulating human-to-human transmission.",

            "text": "To investigate SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in each group of ferrets, we collected blood, nasal washes, saliva, urine, and fecal specimens every other day for 12 days. Collected ferret secretions were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotics (5% penicillin/streptomycin; GIBCO). For virus titration, total RNA was extracted from the collected samples using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (QIAGEN, 2012) and cDNA was synthesized with a cDNA synthesis kit (Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). To quantitate viral RNA copy number, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed targeting the spike (Table 1\n) and ORF1a (Table S1) genes as previously described (Zhu et al., 2020) using the SYBR Green kit (iQTM SYBR Green supermix kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The number of viral RNA copies was calculated by comparison to the number of copies of a standard control. In the NMC-nCoV02 infected group, viral spike RNA was detected in all specimens at 2 dpi. The highest amount of viral RNA was detected in nasal washes and peaked at 4 dpi (3.83 log10 copies/mL), persisting until 8 dpi before dropping below detection limits at 10 dpi (Table 1). The virus was also detected in saliva specimens from 2 dpi (1.73 log10 copies/mL) through 8 dpi. Although viral spike RNA was detected in sera of infected ferrets, the viral copy number was low (peaked titer 0.35 log10 copies/mL) and dropped below detection limits earlier than in nasal wash and saliva specimens. To evaluate the infectious virus titer in each specimen, collected nasal washes and saliva specimens were inoculated onto Vero cells for virus isolation. In IN infected ferret group, NMC-nCoV02 was isolated from both saliva and nasal washes specimens as early as 2 dpi and persisted until 4 and 6 dpi, respectively (Table 1). Nasal washes specimens showed higher virus titers (1.83\u20132.88 log10 TCID50/mL) than saliva specimens (0.82\u20130.92 log10 TCID50/mL). In DC ferret group, virus was isolated from the nasal washes at 4 dpc (2.4 log10 TCID50/mL) and 6 dpc (1.0 log10 TCID50/mL) but not in saliva specimens (Table 1). Because gastrointestinal involvement is a characteristic of coronavirus infections of animals and humans (Leung et al., 2003), we also collected fecal and urine specimens. Viral RNA was detected in a majority of collected specimens in both IN-infected and DC groups as early as 2 dpc (Table 1). Similarly to the IN infected group, the DC group had the highest virus copy numbers (3.27 log10 copies/mL) in nasal washes, with RNA detected through 8 dpc. In addition, viral RNA was detected in saliva and fecal specimens of the DC group for 8 days, whereas the urine specimens contained detectable viral RNA until 4 dpc. For the IC group, 2 out of 6 ferrets were positive for viral RNA in nasal washes and fecal specimens at 4 dpc, although viral RNA copy numbers were lower (0.53 and 0.52 log10 copies/mL, respectively) than in DC ferrets. Due to the cytotoxicity of urine and fecal specimens of ferrets, we could not assess virus isolation and titer in Vero cells. To evaluate the presence of infectious NMC-nCoV02 in urine and fecal specimens, urine or fecal specimens (at 4 dpi) of IN-infected DC or IC ferrets were centrifuged to remove the debris, and the supernatants were inoculated into naive ferrets (n = 3) per each specimen. Nasal washes from specimen-inoculated ferrets were collected at 2, 4, and 6 dpi and infected onto Vero cells for virus isolation. Noticeably, NMC-nCoV02 was isolated from the nasal wash specimens of 2 out of 3 urine-specimen-treated or fecal-specimen-treated ferrets (Table 1). However, we failed to re-isolate virus from the ferrets infected with the fecal specimens of IC ferrets. These results indicate that ferret is highly susceptible for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 derived from body fluids, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 sheds through urine and fecal specimens of infected ferrets.",

Nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, kidney, and intestine tissues were collected using individual scissors to avoid cross contamination. The highest viral RNA levels were detected in nasal turbinate (4.2 log10 copies/g) and lung tissue (1.53 log10 copies/g) at 4 dpi. Viral RNA was also detected in intestine (0.93 log10 copies/g) and kidney (0.87 log10 copies/g) at 4 dpi. At 8 dpi, viral RNA was still detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, kidney, and intestine (Figure 1B). In correlation with viral RNA copy numbers (Figure 1B), the highest infectious virus titer was detected in nasal turbinate (3.23 log10 TCID50/g) and lung tissue (1.4 log10 TCID50/g) at 4 dpi, whereas infectious virus recovery failed from trachea, kidney, and intestine tissues, which carried less than 1.13 log10 viral RNA copies/g (Figure 1C). Finally, infectious NMC-nCov02 was isolated from nasal turbinate (2.07 log10 TCID50/g) and trachea (1.07 log10 TCID50/g) at 8 dpi but not from other tissues at 8 dpi (Figure 1C). However, both viral RNA detection and virus recovery failed in all tested tissues at 12 dpi. These results suggest that virus isolation from infected tissues is closely related to viral RNA copy number.",

The embedded tissues were sectioned and dried for 3 days at room temperature. To detect the viral antigens by IHC, mouse polyclonal antibody raised by the immunization of mice with inactivated NMC-nCoV02 virions was used as a primary antibody. Slides were viewed using the Olympus BX53 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) microscope with DP controller software to capture images. IHC analyses showed that a number of cells in the nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, and intestine sections of NMC-nCoV02-infected ferrets (Figures 1I\u20131L), but not PBS-treated control ferrets (Figures 1E\u20131H), were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Further, the lung histopathology showed that, compared with PBS-treated ferrets, NMC-nCoV02-infected ferrets at 4 dpi showed increased immune infiltration and cell debris in the alveolar wall, bronchial epithelium, and bronchial lumen (Figure S2), evidencing acute bronchiolitis by NMC-nCoV02 infection.",

Most confirmed COVID-19 patients at this time reported close epidemiological association (direct or indirect) with other COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, a growing number of individuals with no travel history to China and no direct contact with infected patients have become infected (Lim et al., 2020). To understand how this virus rapidly spreads within a community, and to inform infection control messaging, it is essential to develop an experimental animal model that can support the active infection, shedding, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to sentinel animals. In this study, we established an infection and transmission ferret animal model for COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to efficiently infect ferrets and induce moderate increases in body temperature (\u223c38.5-40.3\u00b0C). Moreover, we were able to detect viral RNA in blood (for 4 dpi), nasal washes (for 8 dpi), urine (for 8 dpi), and fecal (for 8 dpi) specimens. Findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be shed through multiple routes of body discharge specimens, with these potentially serving as sources for viral transmission to those in close contact with infected individuals.",

Transmission also occurred prior to peak body temperature and body weight loss in infected animals, which is consistent with the infectiousness of individuals during asymptomatic periods. With regard to potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA was detected in nasal washes and fecal specimens in IC ferrets and persisted for 4 days after indirect contact; only one of the two positive animals seroconverted.

            "text": "Following the fortuitous discovery of the natural susceptibility of ferrets to human influenza viruses, ferret models were found to highly reproduce the human disease manifestation of several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzaviruses, and SARS-CoV-1 (Capraro et al., 2008, Chan et al., 2018, Enkirch and von Messling, 2015, Park et al., 2018). In addition to the presence of the respective viral receptors, the anatomic proportions of the ferret upper and lower respiratory tracts, the density of submucosal glands in the bronchial wall, and the number of generations of terminal bronchioles all reproduce the condition in the human respiratory tract (Enkirch and von Messling, 2015). This further supports the significance of ferrets as animal model for human respiratory viral infection. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets showed high virus titers in upper respiratory tracts (nasal washes) and consequently transmitted to naive ferrets by direct contact at high efficiency, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ferret model recapitulates aspects of human infection and transmission. Further, as suspected in recent COVID-19 patients (Kim et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020), we detected the infectious viruses in urine and fecal specimens of virus-infected ferrets. However, there are also limitations in the SARS-CoV-2 ferret model, as SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets showed only mild clinical symptoms and relatively lower virus titers in lungs of infected animals than SARS-CoV-1-infected or MERS-CoV-infected hACE2 or hDPP4 transgenic mice (Glass et al., 2004 and Li et al., 2017). On the other hand, it is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 replicates weaker but persists longer in vivo than SARS-CoV-1, ultimately leading an asymptomatic carrier with a persistent infection to effectively spread the virus. Therefore, given the rapid spreading characteristics of SASRS-CoV-2 in humans, ferret model would be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic anti-virals and preventive vaccines.",

At one-day post-infection, one naive direct contact (DC) and indirect contact (IC) ferrets were introduced into the cage, while IC ferrets were separated from inoculated animals with a partition, which allowed air to move, and without direct contact between animals. This study was conducted with three independent trials. Blood, fecal, nasal wash, saliva, and urine specimens were collected every other day for 12 days from each group of ferrets to detect SARS-CoV-2.
