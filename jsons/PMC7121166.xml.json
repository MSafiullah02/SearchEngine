Moreover, in the last two decades, the emergence of health threats, such as the highly virulent avian A/H5N1 virus in 1997 [28], the SARS [3] in 2003 and the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus in 2009 [4], has made pandemic preparedness a crucial issue for public health worldwide especially with regard to population behaviour and population compliance with public health measures. Spontaneous behaviour change by the population, which alters transmission risk in a pandemic, may affect the impact of organized control measures. In fact, during outbreaks, one of the major problems has always been to communicate with the population in order to influence behaviours and reduce the spread of disease [2].",

As the number of 2009 pandemic influenza cases increased and spread and as extensive media coverage and government advertising campaigns began to appear, the behaviour of the population changed [1]. Higher perceived risk of infection and higher perceived severity of infection were associated with greater use of recommended behaviours in the UK [24]. Other studies have examined the behavioural changes and initial response to the 2009 pandemic in China [30], Hong Kong [5], India [16] and Europe [12] and internationally [15].The FluModCont project, a collaborative project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), started in 2008 and ended in May 2011 (www.flumodcont.org). Main objective of the project was to arrive at an accurate and data-based modelling of the expected course of an influenza pandemic and of the impact of public health measures on its scale and severity. Aims of the project include the study of the social acceptability of public health measures during a pandemic and of the behavioural changes that are to be expected in such circumstances. Within the FluModCont project we investigated how populations would react to respond to and comply with interventions foreseen in national pandemic preparedness plans, which aim to produce accurate and data-based modelling of the potential course of an influenza pandemic and of the impact of public health measures on its scale and severity.",

However, few have investigated reliability and validity of behavioural intentions regarding public health interventions, declared at the beginning of the 2009 influenza pandemic, through comparison with real behavioural responses at the end of the pandemic wave in 2010. The lay public\u2019s behavioural responses during a disease outbreak play an important role in bringing the outbreak under control and should be considered in the development of mathematical models that have been and are largely used to evaluate and inform infectious disease prevention and control policy. Behavioural changes of the population can significantly affect the epidemic spread both quantitatively (mainly slowing the epidemic spread or determining different final epidemic size) and qualitatively (mainly varying the epidemic dynamics). Including parameters that account for spontaneous behavioural changes in mathematical models could be very useful for giving insight to public health policy makers, for planning public health control strategy (e.g. vaccination, antivirals) and better estimating the burden for health-care settings over time. In one, recently published, study it has been demonstrated that the estimation of key epidemiological parameters (in particular the reproductive number) could be largely modified by human behavioural changes [21].",
