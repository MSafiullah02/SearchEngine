            "text": "In recent years cathodoluminescence (CL) in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope (S/TEM) has attracted more and more interest, because its energy resolution is independent from the electron source. The only parameter influencing the energy resolution is given by the analyzing grating. Thus, energy resolutions of \u00b5eV are routinely available. Although such high energy resolution is attractive, CL suffers from some drawbacks. These are the limited range of observable energies -which are usually in the range from infra-red (IR) to soft ultra-violet (UV), which is app. 1 -4 eV (corresponding to wavelengths in the range of app. 1200 -300 nm) -and Fabry-P\u00e9rot interference in thin slab-like specimens [1, 2, 3] . Additionally, the small observed energy transfers are strongly delocalized due to the long-range action of the Coulomb force. Thus, the spatial resolution is also limited. When observing incoherent CL, which is the light being emitted after an electron-hole pair recombination, diffusion of electrons and holes contributes further to a decreased spatial resolution. For many applications, a spatial resolution in the range of a few nanometers is sufficient, as can be found in mineralogy (see for example: [4] ) and plasmonics (see for example: [5, 6, 7, 8] ).",

This means that the electron beam is directly responsible for the creation of photons and no detour via the process of electron excitation and de-excitation is required [9] . For this purpose we investigate the light emission of MgO below the band gap energy. Due to the fact that the refractive index n for visible light is between 1.81 and 1.86 [10] , we make use of the\u010cerenkov effect to coherently create photons inside the sample. 200 keV electrons having a speed of 0.695 \u00b7 c 0 -with c 0 being the vacuum speed of light -are fast enough to fulfill the conditions for\u010cerenkov light emission [11] , hence we can use this effect as light source.

In this case, multiple scattering becomes dominant, thus forming a Landau-background. In such situation any log-ratio method [18] and multiple scattering deconvolution routines [19] fails.

Using these two boundary conditions we can make an educated guess for the sample thickness at the starting-point of the line scan. In the present experiment, we estimated 580 nm sample thickness. Subsequently we varied the sample thickness during the calculation of the reduced thickness d red = d/m for all interference maxima (Fig.6) .

The spectrometer resolution was 0.53 eV as full width at half maximum of the zero loss peak (ZLP) at the fully saturated LaB 6 filament. For data analysis, an 82 nm thin areas of the ample was selected. The thickness was determined via the log-ratio method [18] . Data analysis included multiple scattering deconvolution based on the Fourier-log method utilizing a pre-measured vacuum ZLP. That way, the single scattering distribution (SSD) was retrieved. The band gap is the onset of the inelastic signal and is identified to be 7.3 eV [20] . Subsequent Kramers-Kronig Analysis (KKA) was performed using the sample thickness for normalization [13] . The resulting complex dielectric function \u03b5 1 + i\u03b5 2 was further used for calculating the refractive index n. In Fig.9 the raw experimental spectrum, its SSD and the real part of \u03b5 are shown. Due to the fact that by using CL, we are limited to visible light and thus to energies smaller than the band gap energy of MgO, we have a closer look to the results of KKA only in the range from 1.2 -4.0 eV. Within the band gap, the absorption coefficient \u03ba and thus the imaginary part of \u03b5 are zero. Therefore the square root of \u03b5 1 is equal to the refractive index n. Figure 10 .
