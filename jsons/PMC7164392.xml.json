A set of non-structural\nproteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins (5) assemble to facilitate viral replication\nand transcription. A key component, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also known as\nnsp12), catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and thus plays a central role in the replication\nand transcription cycle of COVID-19 virus, possibly with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as\nco-factors (6). Nsp12 is therefore\nconsidered a primary target for nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors such as remdesivir,\nwhich shows potential for the treatment of COVID-19 viral infections (7, 8). To inform drug design we have determined the structure of nsp12,\nin complex with its cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 by cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) using two\ndifferent protocols, one in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1) and the other in the presence of\nDTT (Dataset-2).",

However, there are\nkey features that distinguish the two. The cryo-EM map allowed us to build the complete\nstructure of COVID-19 virus nsp12 including all residues except S1-D3 and G897-D901. In\ncontrast the first 116 residues were not resolved in SARS-CoV nsp12 (9). The portion of the NiRAN domain resolved in SARS-CoV-12\n(residues 4 to 28 and 51 to 249) comprises eight helices with a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet\nat the N terminus. (9) (Fig. 2A). In the COVID-19 virus structure we additionally\nresolved residues A4-R118. These constitute a structural block with five anti-parallel\n\u03b2-strands and two helices. Residues N215-D218 form a \u03b2-strand in COVID-19 virus\nnsp12 whereas these residues are less ordered in SARS-CoV nsp12. This region make contact with\nthe strand that includes residues V96-A100, thus contributing to the stabilization of its\nconformation. As a result, these four strands form a compact semi \u03b2-barrel\narchitecture. Therefore, we identify residues A4-T28 and Y69-R249 as the complete coronaviral\nNiRAN domain. With the resolution of N-terminal residues, we are also able to identify an\nN-terminal \u03b2-hairpin (D29 to K50, Figs. 1A and\n2A). This \u03b2-hairpin inserts in the groove\nclamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close\ncontacts to stabilize the overall structure (Fig. 2B and\nfig. S5). Another point to note is that, we have observed C301-C306 and C487-C645 form\ndisulfide bonds in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1). However, in the presence of DTT\n(Dataset-2), chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in\nSARS-CoV (fig. S3B).",

We will briefly discuss its possible binding and\ninhibition mechanism based on the results of this study. The efficacy of chain-terminating\nnucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active\nform of the inhibitors into the growing RNA strand. Sofosbuvir\n(2\u2019-F-2\u2019-C-methyluridine monophosphate) is a prodrug which targets HCV ns5b and\nhas been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection (16). It acts by binding to the catalytic site of HCV ns5b\npolymerase (12,16). Given that remdesivir and sofosbuvir are both nucleotide analogs and the\nstructural conservation of the catalytic site between COVID-19 virus nsp12 and HCV ns5b\npolymerase (13, 16) (fig. S7), we modeled remdesivir diphosphate binding\nto COVID-19 virus nsp12 based on superposition with sofosbuvir bound to HCV ns5b (Fig. 4A and fig. S4D). Overall, we found that the nsp12 of\ncovid-19 virus has the highest similarity with the Apo state of ns5b. Given the conformational\nchanges of ns5b in apo/elongation/inhibited states, it appears catalytic residues D760, D761\nand the classic D618 will undergo a conformational change to coordinate the divalent cations\n(Fig. 4B). The latter will anchor the phosphate group\nof the incoming nucleotide or inhibitors together with the allosteric R555 in motif F (Fig. 4C). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or\nits complex with pp-sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir interacts\nwith N291 (equivalent to N691 in COVID-19 virus) but, due to a fluorine substitution on its\nsugar moiety, is not capable to joint into the hydrogen bonding network with S282 and D225\n(Fig. 4D), which is necessary to stabilize the incoming\nnatural nucleotide (13). However,\nremdesivir keeps an intact ribose group, so it may be able to utilize this hydrogen bonds\nnetwork like a native substrate. In addition, T680 in COVID-19 virus nsp12 is also likely to\nform hydrogen bonds with the 2\u2019 hydroxyl of Remdesivir and of course with incoming\nnatural NTP (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the hydrophobic side\nchain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with and stabilize the +1 template RNA uridine\nbase to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir (ppp-remdesivir) (Fig. 4E).",
