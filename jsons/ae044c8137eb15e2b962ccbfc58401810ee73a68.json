They also extensively received azithromycin (93%) as empirical antibiotic treatment in addition to its alleged antiviral and immunomodulatory properties, especially combined with hydroxychloroquine [4] . However, despite these almost systematic antibiotic prescriptions in our COVID-19 patients, we suspected an additional condition that had promoted the S. marcescens outbreak, by contrast to the multidrug-resistant bacteria outbreaks usually attributed to the density of antimicrobial prescriptions in the ICU. as recommended [5] . Caregivers were encouraged to wear gloves during patient care if contact with blood or other body fluids could be reasonably anticipated. They were advised to systematically carry out hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub after removing gloves. However, inappropriate excessive glove use, especially in additional staff not trained to manage ICU patients, resulted in poor compliance with hand hygiene, as reported [6] . Unexpectedly, strengthening PPE combined to the fear of self-contamination by SARS-CoV-2 pushed caregivers to wear gloves systematically, even when not required, as soon as entering the patient room. The IPCT observed that several caregivers did not change their gloves between the cares of two patients. This malpractice likely contributed to the room contamination and S. marcescens cross-transmission between patients. Interestingly, crosstransmission due to continuous glove and gown wearing had been responsible for increase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition rate and change in pathogen pattern during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in a Hong Kong ICU [7] .",
