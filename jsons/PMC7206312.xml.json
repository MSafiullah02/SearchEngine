These iconic examples are far from being the only human developments under threat. The United Nation Office for Disaster Risk Reduction reports that the lives of millions were affected by the devastating floods in South Asia and that around 1,200 people died in the Bangladesh, India and Nepal [30]. Climate change, increasing population density, weak infrastructure and poor urban planning are the factors that increase the risk of floods and aggravate consequences in those areas. Under such scenarios, urban and rural development stakeholders are increasingly concerned with the interactions between the environment and urban and rural development. In order to study such complex interactions, stakeholders need effective and efficient simulation tools.",

When heavy rain falls, water overflows from river channels and spills onto the adjacent floodplains [8]. The hydrological process from rainfall to flood is complex [13]. It involves nonlinear, time-varying interactions between rain, topography, soil types and other components associated with the physical process. Several physics-based hydrological numerical simulation models, such as HEC-RAS [26], LISFLOOD [32], LISFLOOD-FP [6], are commonly used to simulate floods. However, such models are usually computation expensive and expert knowledge is required for both design and for accurate parameter tuning.",

These models can be classified into one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models depending on the spatial representation of the flow. The 1D models treat the flow as one-dimension along the river and solve 1D Saint-Venant equations, such as HEC-RAS [1] and SWMM [25]. The 2D models receive the most attention and are perhaps the most widely used models for flood [28]. These models solve different approximations of 2D Saint-Venant equations. Two-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS 2D [9] is implemented for simulating the flood in Assiut plateau in southwestern Egypt [12] and Bolivian Amazonia [23]. Another 2D flow models called LISFLOOD-FP solve dynamic wave model by neglecting the advection term and reduce the computation complexity [7]. The 3D models are more complex and mostly unnecessary as 2D models are adequate [28]. Therefore, we focus our work on 2D flow models.",
