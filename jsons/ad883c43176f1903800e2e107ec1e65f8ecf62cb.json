An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in our 22-bed intensive care unit (ICU; Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, HKSAR, China) from 12 March to 31 May 2003, when only patients with SARS were admitted. This period was characterized by the upgrading of infection control precautions, which included the wearing of gloves and gowns all the time, an extensive use of steroids, and a change in antibiotic prescribing practices. The pattern of endemic pathogenic organisms, the rates of acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared with those of the pre-SARS and post-SARS periods.",

Infection control measures, in particular, were upgraded, including use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and more rigorous environment cleansing and disinfection. Infection control measures placed heavy emphasis on use of PPE because of the high rate of transmission of SARS to health care workers. Routinely used PPE included N95 respirators; face shields; caps; long-sleeved, disposable gowns; and gloves [5] . For high-risk procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation, goggles were also used. We adopted a policy of \"always gloving\" and \"always gowning\"; that is, gloves and gowns were worn all the time in the ICU, even when there was no direct patient contact. Our standard hand-hygiene practices included hand-washing with chlorhexidine and alcoholic hand rub. We postulated that these changes might result in a change in the pattern of pathogenic isolates, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition, and the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). [6] scores were prospectively determined at admission for all patients. APACHE II scores range from 0-71, with higher scores indicating more-severe illness and predicting an increased likelihood of death.",

Patients colonized or infected with MRSA represent the reservoir for crosstransmission, and ICU acquisition rates were usually positively correlated with ICU importation rates [7] . An MRSA control program was implemented in 2000, whereby all patients with MRSA carriage would be isolated or cohorted, and strict standard precautions were taken to prevent spread of MRSA. As part of the MRSA control program, nasal swab specimens were obtained from all ICU patients to screen for MRSA carriage at the time of ICU admission, then weekly, and finally upon discharge from the ICU. A case of MRSA carriage was defined as an instance in which MRSA was recovered from a patient regardless of the site of and type of specimen (i.e., a screening or clinical diagnostic specimen), or whether the patient was colonized or infected with MRSA. A case of MRSA carriage was further classified as imported, if the first MRSA isolate from any site was recovered within 72 h after ICU admission, or as ICU-acquired if the first MRSA isolate was recovered after 72 h in the ICU. The number of imported and of ICU-acquired cases has been prospectively determined as part of our infection control audit since 2000. MRSA importation rates and MRSA ICU-acquisition rates were calculated as the total number of imported or ICU-acquired cases divided by the total number of ICU admissions over the same time period, respectively [8] . These 2 rates were also compared using patient-days as the denominator to adjust for differences in the length of stay in the ICU.",

            "text": "One important finding of our study is that the frequency of acquisition of MRSA in the ICU was significantly increased despite upgraded infection control measures and a low importation rate of MRSA into the ICU. There are a number of plausible explanations. First, this could be related to our in-fection control policy. During the SARS period, all patients in the ICU were patients with SARS, and the whole ICU was considered to be a high-risk area. The practice of wearing gloves and gowns all the time was introduced at that time with the intention of maximizing staff protection. Although staff were advised to change gloves and cleanse hands before and after each contact with a patient and between dirty body-site and clean body-site care for the same patient, excessive use of gloves, especially worn together with the long-sleeved gowns, could have contributed to low compliance with this policy. In fact, poor compliance with hand hygiene has been identified among glove users in previous studies [17] [18] [19] . This could result in direct cross-transmission of MRSA between patients and also heavy contamination of the ICU environment (e.g., the nursing station, the radiograph viewing room, and other non-patientcare areas), leading to an increase in MRSA acquisition in the ICU. The routine wearing of long-sleeved gowns, which were not changed between contacts with patients, could also have contributed to cross-transmission of MRSA [20] . During the post-SARS period, when the routine wearing of gloves and gowns was abandoned, the MRSA acquisition rate decreased again to the pre-SARS level. Another reason for the increase in MRSA aquisition during the SARS period could be the heavy use of antimicrobials active against gram-negative organisms. This, and the heavy use of steroids, could also have contributed to the overgrowth of both MRSA and Candida species. It has also been suggested that fluoroquinolone use is a risk factor in selecting for MRSA carriage [21] and infection [22] , and the use of fluoroquinolones in our ICU was significantly increased during the SARS period.",
