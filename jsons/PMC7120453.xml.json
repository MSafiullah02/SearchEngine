            "text": "The history of lung transplantation starts in the 1940s: researchers tried to perform lung transplantation, initially in laboratory animals followed by human to human. Many of these early attempts were unsuccessful, and even after successful lung transplantation, most lungs were ultimately rejected despite the use of various immunosuppressants available at that time. The first human single lung transplantation was performed in 1963 by James Hardy in Mississippi, using the left lung of a circulatory death donor. The patient survived for 18 days before dying of renal failure. Over the next decade, many more lung transplantations were performed, with limited success: few patients survived over 2 weeks. At that time, the leading causes of death were peri-operative problems. Subsequent improvements in surgical techniques and especially the introduction of immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin and tacrolimus resulted in rapid progress in the 1980s, with the first successful heart-lung transplantation in 1981 in Stanford by Bruce Reitz and the first single lung transplantation in Toronto in 1983 by Joel Cooper [1]. The second successful lung transplantation from a circulatory death donor was reported by Steen [2]. These advances led to higher success rates and transplant centers all over the world started developing their programs. Today over 100 transplant centers in Europe and North America are active, although the majority of lung transplantations is still performed in a small number of highly specialized centers (see Fig. 22.1). As short-term survival improved substantially, more patients developed long-term complications [3]. These long-term complications compromised the initially increased quality of life (QoL) due to restored normal pulmonary function [4].\n",

There are four main types of lung transplantation; the choice of transplantation type depends on the indication, age, and patient characteristics. First, heart-lung transplantation is performed with the assistance of cardiopulmonary bypass, and mainly for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The second type is unilateral lung transplantation, which is increasingly rarer, where the least functional lung is replaced, mainly used for older pulmonary fibrosis or COPD patients. Third and most practiced, double lung transplantation, where both lungs are sequentially replaced by a donor lung, which can sometimes be performed without the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass. Finally, lobar lung transplantation is even more seldom performed than unilateral lung transplantation. For example, when young patients with CF undergo living donor lobar transplant from their parents in the event of lacking a suitable donor (living-related donor transplantation), or when there is a considerable size mismatch between a large donor and a small receptor. In 2016, the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) reported 62 heart-lung transplantations, 3.748 bilateral lung transplantations, and 913 single lung transplantations.",

            "text": "\nLung transplantation is not possible without donors. Due to the lack of experience, donor\u2019s lungs were initially selected very strictly [6]. However, over the last decade, with increased experience, leading transplant centers started to progressively use more donor lungs that do not fully meet these criteria, to make up for the shortage of lung donors [7, 8]. Also, the donor lung was initially preserved on ice, inducing cold ischemia, and consequently leading to damage of the donor lung. Some centers reported good results using ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), in which the lung is perfused outside of the body [9, 10]. Immediately after lung transplantation, numerous complications can occur, varying from primary graft dysfunction (PGD), infection to acute rejection, among others. The major long-term complication still consists of gradually increasing shortness of breath, due to progressive deterioration of pulmonary function, known as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD is regarded as the main limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation, namely 57% 5-year survival, which is still limited compared to other solid organ transplantations (i.e., after kidney transplantation a 10-year all-cause graft failure of 51.6% is reported) [11, 12]. The best-studied phenotypes of CLAD are bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft dysfunction (RAS).",

Strict criteria of the \u201cstandard-criteria lung donor\u201d (SCD) have previously been defined; donors meeting these criteria are considered \u201cideal\u201d (Table 22.2) [6]. Only 15\u201325% of all multi-organ donors are suitable for lung transplantation, due to injury from cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, lung contusion, airway aspiration, and pulmonary infection at the time of brain insult, as well as underlying lung disease [15]. This scarcity of suitable donor organs leads to persistent mortality of patients on the waiting list; and thus these criteria have been liberalized to \u201cextended-criteria lung donors\u201d (ECD) in order to increase the number of transplantable donor organs [7, 8]. ECD are lung donors not matching the strict criteria of an SCD, for example, because of pre-existing conditions, a smoking history of more than 20 pack-years or hepatitis, among others. There is no consensus about ECD, and multiple centers report different criteria [16\u201320]. This increase of transplantable lungs is associated with a negative impact on early outcome: prevalence of severe PGD, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and duration of mechanical ventilation [16, 18]. There is still debate about whether the use of ECD lungs compromises long-term clinical outcomes [17\u201320]. Figure 22.2 shows the increased use of ECD lungs in lung transplantation [16].\n\n",

It is achieved using a pump-driven perfusion machine that recirculates a preservation solution through the vasculature of the lung in addition to protective mechanical ventilation. The main potential benefit is, in the first place, longer storage time (up to 18 hours, compared to cold storage preservation, which can only preserve the lung up to 6 hours) and the resultant optimization of logistics for lung transplantation [9, 10]. Secondly, the possibility of reconditioning the lung and, therefore, the possibility of transplantation of lungs that otherwise would not be used [21\u201325]. However, in several centers, many of the lungs initially not considered transplantable are already transplanted as an ECD lung without the use of EVLP, with comparable results in large experienced centers [16, 26]. Thus, clinical trials still have to demonstrate if the potential advantages weigh against the costs of the EVLP.",

In the past, it was also referred to as ischemia-reperfusion injury, early graft dysfunction, primary graft failure or re-implantation edema. PGD occurs within the first 72 hours after lung transplantation and is characterized by severe hypoxemia, lung edema with diffuse alveolar damage and radiographic evidence of diffuse pulmonary infiltration without other identifiable cause (Fig. 22.3). The radiographic and histological findings resemble acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [33\u201337]. Several harmful events may contribute to the development of PGD, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, prolonged warm ischemia, cold ischemia during storage in cold preservation\nsolution, reperfusion, and peri-operative insults. Several risk factors exist and are summarized up in Table 22.3 [38\u201340]. This complication leads to prolonged length of mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stays, prolonged hospital stay and even increased short-term mortality, but may also have an impact on long-term survival, as it might impact the later development of BOS, a phenotype of CLAD [41\u201345]. This long-term impact may, however, be modified by accurate treatment. Only supportive treatment is available for PGD, including lung-protective ventilation, restrictive fluid balance, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [38, 46\u201348]. No preventive treatment options have proven to be effective, and retransplantation can be considered, but predicted survival in this setting is poor, and therefore retransplantation for severe PGD is not recommended [49].\n\n",

Infection should therefore always be excluded before a diagnosis of acute allograft rejection is made [51]. There are four main clinical scenarios resulting in an infection in a lung transplant patient. First of all, recipients can host infections from a wide range of microorganisms prior to transplantation (especially patients with CF). Second, colonization with nosocomial organisms occurs frequently during hospitalization. Third, lung grafts could transfer infections from donors to recipients. Finally, transplanted patients are, as previously mentioned, more prone to severe community-acquired or nosocomial infections with relatively innocuous infectious [52]. Time affects which type of infection a lung transplant patient can develop (Table 22.4) [50]. However, infections are more difficult to diagnose in lung transplant patients as classic symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, chills, night sweats and pain may be unremarkable or absent, whereas white blood cell count is commonly altered due to immunosuppressive therapy; also, loss of lung function may be observed in lung infection but is also a common trait in acute and chronic rejection. The main technical investigations that should be undertaken to diagnose an infection and differentiate between infection and rejection are a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with culture, transbronchial biopsies and chest computed tomography (CT).\n",

            "text": "Another frequent complication\nis acute lung allograft rejection, especially during the first year after lung transplantation, which does not cause mortality per se is frequently treatable with a short pulse of IV steroids. However, mortality should not be neglected as 3.6% of deaths among adult lung transplant recipients within the first 30 days, respectively, and 1.8% up to 1-year posttransplant are attributable to acute rejection. Twenty-nine percent of adult patients experience at least one episode of treated acute rejection between discharge from the hospital and 1-year follow-up after transplant [51, 53]. This complication should not be underestimated as patients who suffer one or more episodes of acute rejection already have a higher risk for later CLAD [51]. Symptoms are nonspecific and may include cough, dyspnea, fever, leukocytosis, and an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. High resolution computed\ntomography (HRCT) of the chest may show ground-glass opacities and septal thickening, which are nonspecific features [54]. Risk factors for acute rejection are genetic predisposition, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch and the type of immunosuppressive treatment [54]. Transbronchial biopsies remain the gold standard for diagnosis of acute allograft rejection and to discriminate it from aspiration, infection, drug toxicity, or recurrent disease [51]. There are different types of acute lung allograft rejection, first the classic and most frequent form of acute lung allograft rejection: acute cellular rejection, which is divided into A-grade rejection and B-grade rejection: lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB). A-grade rejection is characterized by perivascular rejection and is mediated by T lymphocytes that recognize foreign HLAs or other antigens. Transbronchial biopsy displays perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates (Fig. 22.4a), whereas BAL presents elevated lymphocyte and neutrophil counts [54]. LB is considered an acute rejection of the small airways mediated by T-lymphocytes, peribronchial mononuclear cell infiltration and sometimes epithelial damage of the airways can be observed on concurrent transbronchial biopsies (Fig. 22.4b) [55]. Second, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which is a rejection of the allograft by the production of antibodies directed to donor HLA molecules [56]. These antibodies may be formed prior to transplantation or de novo. Findings on transbronchial biopsies are mostly non-specific: capillary inflammation and acute lung injury, with or without diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and endothelialitis, sometimes with evidence of endothelial capillary complement 4d staining. In addition to clinical findings and transbronchial biopsies, diagnosis of AMR can be suspected when donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are found in the blood [51, 57]. Also, there is a form of AMR known as hyperacute rejection, which occurs minutes to hours after transplantation and is mediated by preformed antibodies directed toward donor HLA and ABO molecules [58].\n",

It is characterized by active inflammatory lesions, and transbronchial biopsy is characterized by a prominent peribronchiolar infiltrate of mononuclear cells (macrophages and lymphocytes), while BAL often presents excess neutrophilia. This phenotype is important to recognize as it is treatable with azithromycin: after 3\u20136 months of azithromycin therapy, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline may be reversible (defined as an FEV1 and/or FVC increase to >90% of the best posttransplant values). HRCT typically shows air trapping, tree-in-bud opacities and peribronchiolar infiltrates, of which the last two features may improve after azithromycin therapy [32, 59, 60]. Apart from treating ARAD, azithromycin\nmay also prevent it [61]. On the other hand, some patients do not respond to azithromycin therapy, with persistent shortness of breath and BAL neutrophilia. This azithromycin resistant neutrophilia compromises survival and is a risk factor for later CLAD [62].",

Because of the clinical need for a clinical definition instead of a histological one, the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was proposed, which was defined by spirometry by Cooper et al. [64]. A few years ago, more and more patients with an FEV1-decline associated with a restrictive pulmonary defect were reported, which led to the introduction of restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) [65].

There are several non-CLAD causes of pulmonary function decline (previously referred to as non-BOS, non-RAS CLAD) [32]. These can be either allograft-related (persistent infection, persistent acute rejection, anastomotic strictures, disease recurrence) or non-allograft-related (pleural disorders, diaphragmatic dysfunction, obesity, ascites, and chronic kidney failure, among others), or a combination of both.

RAS accounts for approximately 30% of CLAD [65, 67]. When TLC is not available, FEV1/FVC can be used as a surrogate marker (FEV1/FVC > 0.70). RAS has a lower survival rate compared to BOS, and the cause of this poor prognosis is unclear [32, 70]. Histopathology obtained from explanted lungs shows pleural and septal thickening and parenchymal fibrosis in the lung periphery [65]. HRCT demonstrates changes such as interstitial opacities, ground-glass opacities, upper lobe dominant fibrosis, and honeycombing (Fig. 22.8d) [32]. The RAS phenotype is still a very heterogeneous entity, and there are no clear-cut guidelines for diagnosis. As a result, there is some overlap with other (histological) phenotypes, such as acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP), pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). There is still debate whether these phenotypes are pathological subtypes of RAS or represent separate clinical entities [71].",

Likewise, some patients may first develop RAS, but end up with the classical BOS phenotype after the resolution of their infiltrates. Table 22.5 shows an overview of the key features of the phenotypes of CLAD [32]. Many factors may contribute to the development of CLAD.

Treatment of CLAD by increasing or shifting immunosuppression (cyclosporin to tacrolimus, azathioprine to mycophenolate) and/or steroids results at best in a temporary slowing the decline of pulmonary function [75, 76]. The addition of azithromycin may improve lung function in a subset of CLAD patients (mainly the BOS phenotype), even if they were not fully responsive to azithromycin therapy before, due to various anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, mainly targeting neutrophils [77\u201379]. There is also evidence that prophylactic azithromycin initiated at discharge post lung transplantation can reduce CLAD prevalence and improve CLAD-free survival and pulmonary function [79, 80]. Also, several new therapies have been introduced, which may attenuate CLAD progression: total lymphoid irradiation (TLI), extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), fundoplication, mTOR inhibitors, montelukast (a leukotriene receptor antagonist), and pirfenidone [81\u201388]. Whether it may be beneficial to lower immunosuppressive therapy, a therapeutic approach\nalready practiced in other solid organ transplantation patients, e.g., kidney transplantation patients, remains elusive [89\u201392].",

CLAD, however, covers different phenotypes, with different pathophysiological mechanisms and different clinical characteristics. Specifically tailored therapeutic regimes have yet to be developed.
