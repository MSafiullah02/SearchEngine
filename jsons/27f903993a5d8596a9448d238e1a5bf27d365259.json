In other words, according to the hypothesis of the PMT that suggests two 13 decisions process to engage or not engage in health-related behaviours, the threat appraisal 14 components have a higher ability to predict the behavioural intention.

As a result, 35.5% of participants were 20 on the fear control path. Considering the assumptions of the PMT, first, the threat is assessed in 21 terms of severity.
