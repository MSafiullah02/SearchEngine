            "text": "Critically ill patients are likely to develop respiratory and limb muscle weakness [1]. It has been clearly established that intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired limb muscle weakness is a frequent condition, associated with poor prognosis [2\u20136]. Although the consequences of respiratory muscle weakness have been less extensively investigated, some evidences suggest that it may be a risk factor for prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation [7], associated with a higher risk of readmission [8] and higher mortality [9]. Diaphragm dysfunction is frequent in the intensive care unit (more than 60% of mechanically ventilated patients [10]) and is associated with difficult and prolonged weaning and poor prognosis [11\u201314]. Causes of diaphragm dysfunction are multifactorial and no specific treatment is currently available [10]. Diaphragm dysfunction is responsible for prolonged mechanical ventilation and may contribute to the development of \u201cchronic critical illness\u201d, a devastating condition for patients and their families [15]. While the diaphragm undoubtedly plays a crucial role to ensure prompt and safe weaning from mechanical ventilation, recent data suggest that a substantial proportion of patients (up to 44%) can be successfully weaned from the ventilator despite the presence of diaphragm dysfunction [13, 14, 16]. Nevertheless, in contrast with the reported negative impact of ICU-acquired weakness on long-term survival and disabilities [3, 4, 17], it remains unclear whether diaphragm dysfunction per se is responsible for poor medium-term and long-term prognosis. The present study therefore used a previous cohort study conducted in our institution [13] to follow up mechanically ventilated patients in whom diaphragm and limb muscle functions were investigated at the time of liberation from mechanical ventilation. We tested the hypothesis that diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative long-term outcomes and that the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-AW has a particular association on long-term prognosis, in line with the known negative synergistic effects of the two conditions on short-term prognosis.",

Survival and health-related quality of life assessment was performed as described below. Hospital medical charts were analysed to identify the patient\u2019s status (dead or alive) and dates over a 2-year period following inclusion in the study. Patients alive 2 years after inclusion were contacted by phone by the first author. The patient was asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life [24, 25]. The SF-36 questionnaire is a general quality of life questionnaire that evaluates physical and emotional quality of life. The SF-36 questionnaire includes eight multiple-item scales that assess physical functioning, social functioning, physical role, emotional role, mental health, pain, vitality, and general health [26]. Interviews were conducted by a single investigator blinded to the patient\u2019s status in relation to the presence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness in the ICU.",

Patients who were free from diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-AW were more likely placed under mechanical ventilation for coma and were ventilated significantly shorter than others (Table 1). Overall, 43 (57%) patients were successfully weaned from the ventilator after the first attempt. The mean length of ICU stay was 9 (4\u201318) days and the mean length of hospital stay was 21 (10\u201330) days. All ICU survivors had been liberated from mechanical ventilation at the time of ICU discharge.

In addition, our study provides insight into the association of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness with survival and quality of life over a long period of time after the ICU stay. However, some limitations must be acknowledged. The first and main limitation concerns the small sample size finally analysed. Indeed, this is a cohort study with a significant risk of confounding and relatively small event rates. As such the statistical analyses do not adjust for potential confounding and explore simple associations. Our findings must therefore be interpreted cautiously and larger studies are warranted. Secondly, diaphragm function and limb muscle strength were not repeatedly assessed in our study. Consequently, the findings in terms of survival and quality of life could not be correlated with possible recovery of either diaphragm function or limb muscle strength. Thirdly, ICU-acquired weakness was assessed with MRC score that relies on the cooperation of the patients. Therefore, even if patients were confirmed awake, it is a volitional measurement that may be associated with a ceiling effect and poor responsiveness. Fourthly, due to small size of the cohort, competing risk of death could not be take into account which may have created a bias in the assessment of health care quality of life.",
