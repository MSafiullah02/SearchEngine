However, the assessment of loss of appetite was difficult because of its subjective nature; diarrhoea was a more objective finding. Different possible causes might account for diarrhoea. First, direct virus attack on the digestive tract could have resulted in diarrhoea; this is supported by the detection of viral nucleocapsid protein in epithelial cells. Second, the administration of anti\u2010viral drugs or Chinese traditional medicines might also have contributed since they commonly induce nausea and diarrhoea. Third, dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota induced by antibiotics could have exacerbated digestive symptoms.",

They noticed seven cases (3%) manifesting only digestive symptoms without respiratory symptoms. Patients with atypical primary symptoms or atypical first symptoms had also been reported in previous literature. It was an indicator that could help us to identify COVID\u201019 early and prompt the gastroenterologists to strengthen self\u2010protection to reduce the potential risk of infection. Interestingly, they pointed out that patients with digestive symptoms were inclined to have a worse prognosis than those without digestive symptoms (34.3% discharged vs 60% discharged). We noticed that there were 74 (36%) critically ill patients in this paper and the severe and critical rate was much higher than the large\u2010scale statistics rate in CDC report, which was 18.5%.\n20\n The results supported our finding that critical patients with high severe rate were more likely to manifest digestive symptoms.

When the viral load in the stool is high or in a virus\u2010friendly environment, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 might spread easily via faeces. Ong et al\n29\n offered a typical example of faecal transmission. They collected samples from the bathroom of a patient with confirmed faecal positivity by RT\u2010PCR and no diarrhoea. Samples from the surface of the toilet bowl, inside bowl of the sink and the door handle were positive results, while post\u2010cleaning samples were negative. More details were given by von Doremalen et al\n30\n that viable virus existed for at least 3 hours in aerosols after their formation, and for up to 2 or 3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. Based on the high viral infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we believe that exposure to a faecal\u2010contaminated environment, such as public toilets or areas with poor sanitation, may cause \u2018faecal\u2010mucosal transmission\u2019 when individuals touch their mouth, nose or eyes with contaminated hands. Alternatively, the virus may infect patients\u2019 healthy family members through the faecal\u2010aerosol\u2010respiratory pathway by sharing toilets.

The latest treatment protocol in China stipulates that two RT\u2010PCR tests of respiratory specimens carried out more than 24 h apart should be negative before a patient is discharged from the hospital, and that the patient should be isolated for 14 days after discharge.\n19\n In view of the possibility that stool samples of the discharged patient could still be positive, we suggest that the patient should implement a more thorough protocol for hand hygiene during isolation, thoroughly disinfect toilets and sinks, and try to avoid sharing toilets with family members. Meanwhile, we recommend a test for faecal nucleic acid before a patient is released from isolation. Medical staff who perform gastrointestinal endoscopy for isolated convalescent patients should consider all patients to be confirmed cases and take strict protective measures.
