            "text": "Tissue perfusion after cardiac surgery may become impaired due to multiple factors and in turn induce organ dysfunction, organ failure, prolonged stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital and increased mortality [1]. Unfortunately, the adequacy of tissue perfusion remains difficult to assess. Surrogate markers like central venous to arterial PCO2 difference (\u0394PCO2), oxygen extraction ratio (ERO2) and lactate are used to evaluate this adequacy [2, 3]. Elevated arterial lactate is a commonly used marker of global anaerobic metabolism and even mild hyperlactatemia has recently found to be correlated both with microcirculatory flow abnormalities and a worse outcome [3\u20135]. However, lactate is not a pure marker of anaerobic metabolism and non-hypoxic causes of hyperlactatemia are common in septic shock or after cardiopulmonary bypass [6\u20138]. Accordingly, additional markers of tissue perfusion have been explored. ERO2 can be calculated on basis of oxygen arterial saturation (SaO2) and central venous saturation (ScvO2) using the following formula: ERO2 = (SaO2\u2212ScvO2)/SaO2. Hemodynamic monitoring guidelines recommend to monitor this ratio after cardiac surgery and a ScvO2 \u2265 70% is often considered a target for optimal hemodynamic resuscitation [9, 10]. However, because of the potential extraction defect some patient might have microcirculatory impairment with a normal or supranormal ScvO2.",

Moreover, limited prospectively reported data on \u0394PCO2 after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are available. Finally, in clinical practice \u0394PCO2 and lactate or ERO2 values frequently appear contradictive, which makes the interpretation of an elevated \u0394PCO2 difficult. Several authors already suggested that interpreting \u0394PCO2 with ScvO2 improve the prognostic significance of these markers [11, 12, 16]. De Backer in a recent review on hemodynamic in shock suggests an algorithm combining \u0394PCO2, ScvO2 and lactate [17]. This multiparametric approach could better discriminate different cardiovascular profiles and improve our understanding of apparently contradictive patterns. Still, no clinical study has yet evaluated algorithms combining these three markers following cardiac surgery.",

Reversion was systematically per- formed with protamine at the end of CPB. CPB was performed under normothermia and myocardial protection was achieved by intermittent cold blood cardioplegia. Boluses of ephedrine and/or phenylephrine were given intraoperatively to maintain mean arterial pressure between 50 and 80 mm Hg. The heart was defibrillated after aortic unclamping, if sinus rhythm did not resume spontaneously.

The first blood sample was collected on admission to the ICU (T0) and 6 h (T6), 12 h (T12) and 24 h (T24) after. Venous and arterial blood gas were drawn simultaneously from radial arterial catheter and central venous catheter.

The patient\u2019s heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central temperature and oxygen saturation were measured simultaneously to the blood samples. The primary outcome was ICU length of stay.

If \u0394PCO2 and ERO2 were both normal, lactate elevation was considered to be non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia. \u0394PCO2 elevation was considered to reflect low cardiac output (CO) in case of high ERO2 or microcirculatory dysfunction with impaired oxygen extraction if ERO2 was normal. An elevated ERO2 in presence of a normal \u0394PCO2 was considered to reflect a decrease in DO2 non-related to a low CO (anemia, hypoxemia). Patients with global anaerobic metabolism, non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia or microcirculatory dysfunction with impaired oxygen extraction as determined by the algorithm were considered to have a high-risk profile. The ICU length of stay (LOS) of high-risk profile patients was then compared to the rest of the population.",

To calculate markers POD1 variations we identified, among the whole dataset, the successive samples of Lactate, \u0394PCO2 and ERO2 measured within 6 to 12 h intervals in a given patient and calculated the markers variations as following: Marker variation = 100% \u00d7 (second marker value\u2212initial marker value)/initial marker value.

As previously reported in retrospective studies, our prospective study demonstrates that a widening in \u0394PCO2 on POD1 after conventional elective cardiac surgery is quite frequent [11, 15]. The reason why \u0394PCO2 remains elevated on ICU admission and on POD1 is unclear. An adequate venous blood flow is the main contributor of \u0394PCO2 and depends on both cardiac output and tissue perfusion [14, 20]. It has been demonstrated that \u0394PCO2 after cardiac surgery is only poorly correlated to cardiac output or regional blood flow [21]. It has been suggested that impaired microcirculation could be responsible for the widening in \u0394PCO2 especially when it is associated with normal ScvO2 [11, 12]. In these studies the pattern of a high \u0394PCO2 with a normal ScvO2 was associated to further post-operative complications, impaired splanchnic function or elevated lactate. Yet, it is still uncertain whether a high \u0394PCO2 after cardiac surgery is related to microcirculatory hypoperfusion and further studies are needed.",

For example, high lactate is a marker of global anaerobic metabolism whereas high \u0394PCO2 indicates decreased blood flow that can occur without anaerobic metabolism [14].

Similarly, ERO2 and lactate level taken alone at the time of admission did not predicted a prolonged ICU stay. It is important to not misinterpret these results. We underline that the prognostic value of hyperlactatemia or abnormal ERO2 after cardiac surgery has been demonstrated in several studies [3, 9, 22, 23]. Concerning \u0394PCO2, an elevation \u2265 6 mmHg at admission has also been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in high surgical risk patients but the results are conflicting in cardiac surgery [11, 13, 15]. In a recent retrospective study, high \u0394PCO2 after cardiac surgery was not associated with a worst outcome but the authors analyzed \u0394PCO2 alone [15]. Conversely, Habicher et al. found that in presence of normal ScvO2 \u2265 70%, a high \u0394PCO2 (\u0394PCO2 \u2265 8 mmHg) was associated to further post-operative complications [11]. The combination of these two markers seem to better predict complications. Similarly, our study suggests that an algorithm combining \u0394PCO2 with ERO2 and lactate improved prognostic signification of these markers at admission. Indeed, in our study, 43% of patients with high \u0394PCO2 at the time of admission were classified as low-risk group and 44% patients with low \u0394PCO2 were eventually categorized in the high-risk group. Consequently, we think that \u0394PCO2, ERO2 and lactate should not be interpreted separately but together using an algorithm.",

However, when associating to this preoperative scoring system the \u0394PCO2, ERO2 and lactate measures immediately at the ICU admission almost half of our population was eventually classified as high-risk group. Interestingly, although our study was lacking of power for prognosis evaluation, ICU and hospital stays were significantly longer and patients had more acute renal failure in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group while their EuroSCORE 2 did not differ significantly. We think that our algorithm-based evaluation at the time of ICU admission may have led to the identification of clinically significant intraoperative complications.",

            "text": "The design of our interpretation algorithm is quite similar to the algorithm which was recently published by De Backer in a review on hemodynamic in shock [17]. Yet, some differences should be discussed. For example, De Backer considers hyperlactatemia with normal ERO2 and \u0394PCO2 as a profile of high cardiac output with dysoxia (i.e. sepsis). In our algorithm we consider this pattern as non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia. Indeed, in the setting of cardiac surgery, the occurrence of hyperlactatemia without evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery (DO2) has been reported [7]. Although, the pathogenesis of this disorder remains unclear, according to the authors it should be considered as reflecting a type B lactic acidosis instead of an anaerobic metabolism. These patients with non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia were still considered as high risk. Indeed, an increased lactate level with a normal tension difference/arteriovenous O2 content difference ratio (\u0394PCO2/\u0394ContO2; another anaerobic metabolism marker) was shown to be correlated to poor prognosis in a medical ICU [25]. Another difference of interpretation relates to the pattern of an increased ERO2 with normal lactatemia and \u0394PCO2. Both our algorithm and De Backer\u2019s findings agree on a decrease in DO2 but De Backer associates it with dysoxia while we consider a rise in ERO2 to be a normal adaptation mechanism [1]. Nevertheless, we regard both algorithms as useful tools for clinicians to improve comprehension of the patterns drawn by these routine markers of systemic perfusion. This study is the first to describe the incidence of the different hemodynamic profiles defined by these algorithms.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, the circulatory profiles defined by the algorithm were not externally validated by, for example, a measurement of cardiac output and an evaluation of microcirculation by video microscopy. Further studies are needed to assess both macro and microcirculation in the suggested hemodynamic profiles. Another important limitation was the small size of the study population and the moderate severity of disease within it. We used central instead of mixed-venous blood to assess ERO2 and CO2 derived variables; our results may have differed if a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) had been used [26]. However, PAC is no longer used in conventional cardiac surgery. Hypothermia is also a potential confounder for \u0394PCO2 measurement. It may decrease cellular respiration and CO2 generation, especially for very low temperature [20]. Nevertheless none of our patients had profound hypothermia on ICU admission and normothermia was rapidly achieved for all of our patients. Finally, lactate, \u0394PCO2 or ERO2 surely have different physiological kinetics, with the clearance of lactate probably slower than that of ERO2 and CO2 derived variables. This makes it difficult to interpret a snapshot of those markers. That being said, taking the kinetics variations of the markers into account would also be very difficult. We designed our algorithm to provide clinicians with an everyday tool for the interpretation of arterial and central venous blood gases, and it appears to correlate with a clinical reality as it predicts occurrence of post-operative AKI and longer ICU and hospital stays.",
