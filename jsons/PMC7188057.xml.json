She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia by abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) findings and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result. She was transferred to our hospital on February 2, 2020 for more comprehensive treatment. A course of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Arbidol, convalescent plasma, and methylprednisolone did not abate her declining condition. On February 16, life-supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood, and feces became negative on February 23. Although there was no evidence of continued virus replication, lung function continued to deteriorate. On February 26, her comprehensive assessment read: The x-ray manifestations showed \u201cwhite lung.\u201d Despite ECMO with mechanical ventilation, oxygenation index was <60 mm Hg. Echocardiography showed the right heart was enlarged, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 80 mm Hg, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60%. Kidney, liver, and left heart function were normal. With best practices exhausted and continued decline, lung transplantation was considered and approved by the ethics committee. After her family signed informed consent, we registered the patient into the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS).",

During the operation, we found no visible pleural effusion in the thorax cavity, and the right heart of the recipient was enlarged and turned clockwise. The shape of the resected lungs was complete, dark red, tough, without apparent mass, and the surface was uneven. The lungs were consolidated entirely in the cross-section, without noticeable mucus (Fig. 1B). The patient's vital signs were stable after surgery, but 40 hours later, she showed a remarkably decreased oxygenation index, and CT scan presented an extensive consolidation of the donor's lungs. Those manifestations suggested acute rejection. Steroid pulse therapy was used to control rejection (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days, then weaning 40 mg daily to a final dose of 40 mg/day). After the first dose, the patient's oxygenation index improved rapidly, and the chest x-ray became clear (Fig. 1C). The ECMO was removed successfully on the fifth day.",

The resected lungs exhibited extensive consolidation, but they were softer than the first patient's lungs (Fig. 1E). Considering the high proportion of HLA mismatch between donor and recipient, we used high-dose methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days, then weaning 40 mg daily to a final dose of 40 mg/day) to prevent acute rejection after surgery. This patient's condition was stable, and ECMO was withdrawn on the second day after surgery. The chest x-ray showed the transplant lungs were clear (Fig. 1F).",
