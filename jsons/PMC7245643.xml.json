            "text": "Disaster workers are often exposed to traumatic psychological experiences during disaster response efforts. As such, disaster responders are at increased risk for physical and mental health problems (Benedek et al. 2007; Berger et al. 2012). Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the most common mental health sequelae experienced by disaster workers (Bromet et al. 2017a, b; Galea et al. 2005; Neria et al. 2008; Thormar et al. 2010). Trauma-related mental health symptoms are also associated with increased engagement in negative health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as overall increased risk for physical morbidity and mortality (Thormar et al. 2010; Bruce et al. 1994; Lavretsky et al. 2002). Moreover, repeated trauma exposures, such as those experienced by professional responders (e.g., police, firefighters, and paramedics), increase the likelihood that workers will develop psychiatric symptoms (Neria et al. 2008; Breslau et al. 2008; Bromet et al. 2017a, b; Brunet et al. 2001; Caramanica et al. 2015; Shrira et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Despite the evidence of risk associated with repeated trauma exposures, most previous work in the area of disaster mental health has focused on efforts to prevent the onset of PTSD via acute post-trauma interventions such as Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM). CISM includes pre-incident training, initial post-incident defusing, group debriefing (e.g., Critical Incident Stress Debriefing), and further counseling (Mitchell and Everly 1997a). CISM is an umbrella term for post-trauma interventions, which are often heterogeneous in terms of content and delivery (e.g., varying numbers of sessions). While individuals who participate in such programs report finding them subjectively helpful for processing traumatic exposures (Irving and Long 2001; Mitchell and Everly 1997b), there have been few high quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and there is some evidence suggesting that aspects of these interventions (i.e., psychological debriefing) may inadvertently exacerbate some participants\u2019 distress (Tuckey and Scott 2014). Psychological First Aid (PFA) is an alternative intervention intended to be responsive to some of the limitations of CISD. PFA focuses on managing acute stress symptoms and deemphasizes debriefing strategies (Nash and Watson 2012; Ruzek et al. 2007). Nonetheless, the literature supporting PFA also remains sparse with few methodologically strong randomized trials (Fox et al. 2012). Moreover, neither intervention focuses on building up coping resources in advance of a traumatic exposures in order to promote psychological resilience (Davydov et al. 2010).",

Resilience in this context is conceptualized as the adaptive use of coping skills such as utilizing social supports, engaging in self-care activities, and improving health behaviors. Improving resilience in vulnerable communities, such as those previously affected by large-scale disasters, and those likely to be called upon repeatedly to respond to disasters (e.g., Red Cross/FEMA personnel, police, firefighters, and paramedics) is particularly important. For example, many World Trade Center (WTC) responders were either personally impacted and/or called upon as part of their job to respond to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Evidence suggests that the subsequent exposure to Hurricane Sandy substantially increased the likelihood of PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in this population (Bromet et al. 2017a, b). Thus, there is a critical need for resilience building programs aimed at assisting disaster workers in the development of adaptive coping skills. Such programming is essential for maintaining a resilient disaster response workforce (White House 2007).",

These programs are effective in reducing perceived stress, improving quality of life, and attenuating mood and anxiety symptoms (e.g., Sood et al. 2011). However, they generally require a significant time commitment (i.e., 8\u201312 weeks), can be costly to deliver, and are not designed specifically to address the types of stressors experienced by disaster workers. Disaster response agencies have responded to these shortcomings by developing training guides or brief disaster preparedness programs for their workforces, but often the criteria for the development of these programs is unknown and no data are publicly available on their efficacy.",

While traditional training programs for responders focus almost exclusively on psychoeducation and emotional support, the DWRT incorporates empirically supported psychological techniques such as motivational interviewing, health behavior goal setting, and relaxation training into its curriculum. The program teaches strategies for recognizing the signs and symptoms of traumatic stress reactions in oneself and others and normalizes help seeking behavior. It also encourages participants to think about ways to make themselves and their organizations more resilient to stress in advance of a crisis.",

This study fills a critical gap in the disaster mental health literature by rigorously evaluating a brief and cost-effective structured program designed to promote resilience for disaster workers via a randomized clinical trial (RCT). We hypothesized that, relative to a waitlist control group, the participants receiving the DWRT program would have significant increases in their levels of adaptive health behaviors and levels of posttraumatic growth, and significantly decreased levels of perceived stress from baseline to follow-up at 3-months post-intervention. In the subset of participants exposed to subsequent trauma(s) between baseline and follow up, we also expect to also see lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms in among the DWRT group, relative to those in the waitlist condition.",

Hurricane Sandy responders were targeted for participation in this trial given their exposure to a common stressor and the fact that most reported continuing to be active in community disaster response efforts. Individuals who indicated they were no longer active disaster workers were excluded from the present trial given that the aim of the present trial was building resilience in an active disaster worker population. The sample was predominately Caucasian (69.9%) and non-Hispanic (86.7%), but was diverse in terms of gender (56.0% female), marital status (47.0% married), and employment status (50.6% full-time employment).

Agency heads and community leaders were invited to share about their organizational training needs and were provided with an overview of the DWRT program. Additional recruitment methods included mailing flyers to agencies involved in hurricane response efforts and spitball recruitment (i.e., asking agency leaders to share information with their contacts in the responder community). Organizations were required to have approximately 20 eligible volunteers or staff members in order to participate. This was intended to ensure sufficient participation for randomization within-agency. Participation was strictly voluntary and held outside of regular business hours. Eligibility criteria included participation as a responder to the Hurricane Sandy disaster (professionally or as a volunteer) and active responder status. Eligibility was established through the completion of a phone screen and participants were required to provide informed written consent.

Randomization was done within agency cohorts, rather than across the whole sample, in order to account for the clustering of volunteer versus professional responders within organizations. The DWRT workshop was administered by trained mental health professionals (clinical psychologist or social worker). Following the workshop, participants completed a short exit survey to assess satisfaction with the training. Symptom measures were not repeated immediately post-intervention as no immediate change in anxiety, stress, or trauma symptoms was expected. Change in symptoms was assessed 3-months following completion of the workshop (T2) to enable time for participants to begin engaging in prescribed resilience building activities to allow time for subsequent work-related trauma and stress exposure. At T2, participants repeated the baseline measures as well as an additional questionnaire about subsequent exposure to traumatic events since the last assessment. All participants were compensated up to $60 for their time and those assigned to the waitlist were invited to participate in the workshop after the completion of the 3-month post-intervention period.",

Beyond evident physical health benefits (Penedo and Dahn 2005), cardiovascular exercise is known to substantially reduce mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety (Stathopoulou et al. 2006). Emerging evidence also supports the efficacy of exercise for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms in children, adolescents and adults (Wolff et al. 2011). A variety of mechanisms by which exercise confers benefits have been proposed including increased social contact, improved self-esteem and biological factors such as increased synthesis and release of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors (Portugal et al. 2013). Therefore, it is possible that increasing physical activity in disaster worker populations could increase both physiological and psychosocial resilience. Likewise, spirituality has been linked with overall better quality of life and reduced PTSD in both veteran and trauma-exposed community samples (Connor et al. 2003; Currier et al. 2015). Thus, increased spirituality may also buffer in some ways against the deleterious effects of trauma exposure.",

This may be for a number of reasons including overall low base rates of these symptoms in the present sample. Although we selected participants on the basis of their engagement in either voluntary or job-related disaster response efforts to Hurricane Sandy, many participants primarily reported work-related exposures and reported low levels of personal storm-related exposures such as property loss/damage, financial hardship, or physical injuries. This is notable as personal losses and physical injuries are important risk factors for the development of PTSD (Norris et al. 2010). Moreover, around 40% of the overall sample denied experiencing additional trauma exposure in the interceding 3 months between randomization and the follow-up assessment.",

In this sub-sample, time by condition interactions were observed wherein those who participated in the DWRT were significantly likely to report improved stress-management skills from T1 to T2 and levels of perceived stress, depression and PTSD symptoms either stayed the same or decreased from T1 to T2. However, trauma-exposed participants in the waitlist condition experienced a significant increase in mental health symptoms. This suggests that participation in the DWRT engaged the target of teaching adaptive coping skills and conferred resilience to subsequent trauma exposures, which was not observed in the waitlist group. Again, while effect sizes were modest, even small improvements in health behaviors, self-care, and resistance to trauma-related psychological symptoms may foster a more dynamic workforce that is able to continue responding to long-lasting crises, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "While this represents a notable first step towards developing evidence-based resilience building programing for disaster workers, the present study also has limitations, which should be addressed in future work. First, the present sample was heterogeneous in terms of occupation and volunteer versus professional responder status. As such, degree of disaster exposure, amount of formal disaster response training, and risk for subsequent disaster/trauma exposures likely varied substantially across the sample. Thus, additional research is needed in larger samples to enable exploration of potential moderators of intervention efficacy. Further, randomization was done within agencies, thus it is possible that social transmission of intervention information happened between active and waitlist participants. This may have attenuated outcomes in the intervention group. A cluster randomization strategy may be used to address this in future studies. Overall rates of PTSD and depression symptoms were also relatively low in the present sample. Thus, it remains unknown how well this intervention may work in samples with higher levels of stress, psychopathology, or burnout. Moreover, mental health symptoms and health behaviors were assessed via self-report instruments. Future work would be strengthened by the incorporation of multimethod outcome assessment. For the current study, the DWRT workshops were delivered by trained mental health professionals. Mental health professionals are not always readily available in disaster settings and training workers within agencies to deliver the intervention may promote its dissemination. Thus, future research should assess the efficacy of the DWRT as delivered by trained peers. It also remains unknown how treatment expectancy effects affected outcomes. Future work should compare the DWRT to active control conditions, matched for time and trainer-attention. Finally, the sample was only followed through 3-months post randomization and, as such, it remains unknown how durable the effects of the intervention will be. Future studies should incorporate additional follow ups to address the question of whether follow-up or booster trainings are necessary to sustain the effects of resilience-building interventions.",

The DWRT is a manualized resilience building intervention that is easy to disseminate, and appropriate for a wide variety of disaster worker groups. Preliminary evidence from NIEHS Grantee communities, such as groups affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, suggests that peer trainer models may also be feasible and increase the potential reach of the intervention. While previous disaster mental health interventions have focused on post-trauma exposures (e.g., psychological first aid and CISM), limited systematic efforts have focused on the development and testing of targeted preventative interventions for promoting resilience in poly-trauma exposed populations. Continued efforts are needed to ensure the resilience of the disaster response workforce; efforts vital to maintaining national security and the safety of communities.",
